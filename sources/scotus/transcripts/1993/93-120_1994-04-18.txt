ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD N. SUTTER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SUTTER:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

At issue is whether certain costs incurred by

11

petitioner -- by petitioner's related medical school in

12

support of petitioner's graduate medical education program

13

are allowable under Medicare.

14

There's no question that these costs, which are

15

clerical and support costs in support of the program,

16

would normally be allowable costs.

17

conceded that.

18

because the hospital did not claim these costs in prior

19

years.

20
21

22

The Government has

The question is, are they unallowable

It is important to understand the implications of the
Government's position.
QUESTION:

Before you go any further, may I ask

23

why you say that there is no doubt that they would

24

normally be allowable costs?

25

MR. SUTTER:

Because the -3

QUESTION:

What -- perhaps under the regulation,

2

as you interpret it, but what provision of the statute

3

allows these costs to be charged -- to be reimbursed?

4
5

MR. SUTTER:

The statute requires the

reimbursement of reasonable cost --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SUTTER:

Right.
-- and it requires -- this will be

8

found in the Ohio State amicus brief at pages 1 and 2.

9

requires the reimbursement of direct and indirect costs.

10

12

QUESTION:

It

Costs of services provided to the

patients, isn't that right?
MR. SUTTER:

Costs that are necessary in the

13

efficient delivery of needed health services.

14

be the opening -- opening phrase, the first three or four

15

lines of the provision.

16

QUESTION:

That would

Section 1395x(v) defines inpatient

17

hospital services to include services -- services provided

18

in a hospital by an intern or a resident in training.

19

MR. SUTTER:

20

QUESTION:

21

Right.
Or by a physician where the hospital

has a teaching program approved as specified.

22

MR. SUTTER:

23

QUESTION:

Right.
But what you are trying to charge

24

here, as I understand it, unless I mistake the case, are

25

not services provided, but rather the costs of training

these people.
MR. SUTTER:

2

Well, it is the cost of services,

3

too, Justice Scalia, because interns and residents are

4

actually providing care in the hospital, and what we are

5

talking about is the stipends that are paid to them, the

6

compensation paid to the teaching physicians, and the

7

related support costs, and --

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, are they providing care -- I

thought what you were talking about is, you know, we've

10

all of us been sick in a hospital and the doctor comes in

11

and he has three young doctors with him, you know, and

12

they are all saying, oh, wow, ooh, and aah, but they are

13

not providing any services.

They are just learning from

14

what the other doctor does.

I thought that's what we're

15

talking about here.

16

MR. SUTTER:

17

QUESTION:

Sometimes they provide services.
Well, sometimes, but in order to

18

recover under the statute, you must provide services, as I

19

see it.
MR. SUTTER:

20

A lot of times they are providing

21

services.

22

true they observe, but they're also providing services.

23
24
25

They do come in and examine patients, and it's

Whenever they are, it seems to me

you're entitled to it under the statute.

I asked you if you claimed under a particular

MR. SUTTER:
QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

Yes.

So you do claim that they're --

11

you're entitled to recover for costs expended on them,

12

even when they're not providing service?

MR. SUTTER:

Yes.
Yes.

But the entire program's a

When they're learning?

Well, I understand -This is not a classroom

instruction.
QUESTION:

Your basis for that, as I understand

21

it, is a committee report which the Secretary has chosen

22

to follow in his regulation.

23

Now, I have no problem with the Secretary's

24

following a committee report in the regulation to be

overly generous to hospitals, if he wishes, and nobody has

standing to challenge that, if he gives the hospital more

2

money than they're entitled to, but you're coming in and

3

saying that he must do it in the face of the statute, it

4

seems to me.
MR. SUTTER:

6

The statute says --

7

QUESTION:

No, I don't think that's correct.

Mr. Sutter, is your position

8

essentially that the Secretary has interpreted a

9

regulation one way and arbitrarily not applying that same

10

way to you?

I thought that was essentially your position.

11

MR. SUTTER:

12

QUESTION:

13

Certainly.
That because you're making this claim

late, you're being treated differently?

14

MR. SUTTER:

15

QUESTION:

Certainly, yes.
And that your opening point was to

16

the extent that these particular costs, as being properly

17

reimbursable if you had made your claim on time --

May I ask you a question about the

continuing significance of this?
MR. SUTTER:

Certainly.

QUESTION:

1

As I understand it, after 1986, this

2

is no longer a problem because the system is different, is

3

that so?
MR. SUTTER:

4

That is correct.

This was still

5

under the reasonable cost system, and effective for years.

6

Beginning on or after July 1, 1985, there is a new system

7

in effect.
QUESTION:

8

9

So the impact of the issue before us

is for how many years?
MR. SUTTER:

10

Well, it will have a carryover

11

impact because this is the base year, and under the new

12

system you look at the cost per resident trended forward,

13

so the monetary impact for this year itself, for '85,

14

would be roughly $600,000 to $700,000, but it would also

15

have some carryover effect.
QUESTION:

16

Is there a point where it will make

17

no difference?

time span we're dealing with, and I -MR. SUTTER:

That is, I'm trying to understand what

Specifically we're dealing with

That is the year under appeal.
QUESTION:

But how long will this matter that

22

you're complaining about have an impact on hospitals

23

situated as you are?

24
25

MR. SUTTER:

It could have an indefinite impact,

until Congress changes the current law, which still looks

1

back at a base year and trends it forward.
QUESTION:

2

When you say it has a carryover

3

effect, I take it what you mean is that if it's allowed

4

for the base year, you go on charging the same amount

5

every successive year adjusted for inflation so long as

6

you do not pull back on the service?

7

MR. SUTTER:

Well, actually, it's -- you get a

8

base year amount per resident, and then you would multiply

9

that by your current number of residents, so if the number

10

of residents declines --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SUTTER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SUTTER:

15
16

So it gives you a rate, in effect.
It gives -- it's a rate.
Yes, okay.
It's a rate per resident, that's

correct.
To follow up, though, under the regulation,

17

these are regarded as indirect costs under paragraph (g),

18

and the Secretary has conceded in her petition, her cert

19

petition, that these would normally be allowable costs.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that we have

21

authority to compel the Secretary to be consistent.

22

mean, consistency in a regulation is admirable, and

23

legally necessary, but I'm not sure it's legally

24

necessarily where to make him be consistent would make him

25

contravene the words of the statute.

MR. SUTTER:

Well, Justice Scalia, Congress has

never expressed any dissatisfaction with the inclusion of

these costs.

an adjustment for some indirect costs in '84, was it?
MR. SUTTER:

The chronology is that in '74 for

3

the first time the hospital began claiming the costs of

4

the related medical school and claimed costs for physician

5

compensation.

6

7
8

9

In '84, it began to claim some of the clerical
costs, and then '85 claimed the remainder.
QUESTION:

But you were allowed -- you were

allowed the addition that you sought in ' 84.

10

MR. SUTTER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SUTTER:

That is correct.
But in '85 you weren't.
That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

13

That is correct, yes, but we really do have the situation

14

here where, to give you a hypothetical of how it would

15

operate, say in years 1 through 5, if a hospital had, say,

16

claimed the physician compensation for a particular

17

teacher in the GME program but that would have been

18

allowed, but say in year 6 it failed to claim it, under

19

the Secretary's position you would have the situation

20

where for year 7 and thereafter, the Secretary would --or

21

the hospital would forever lose out.

22

And I think that's very hard to justify with the

23

statute, which talks about reimbursing actual cost,

24

excluding therefore only that part found to be unnecessary

25

in the efficient delivery of needed health services, and

1

if something is necessary in years 1 through 5, it should

2

be necessary in year 7.
QUESTION:

3

Well, do you say, Mr. Sutter, that

4

you could prevail simply under the statute without regard

5

to the regulation?

6

MR. SUTTER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SUTTER:

9

We say both, but we do say -Well, I -Yes.

The answer to the question is

yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we do say -QUESTION:

10

Does that mean that the Secretary

11

could not, under a properly drawn regulation, deny these

12

costs?

13

MR. SUTTER:

That would be our contention, that

14

they are part of the necessary delivery of needed health

15

services, that's correct, and they have been from the

16

beginning.

17

there are many university hospitals that for many years

18

have been reimbursed for these costs, and most teaching

19

hospitals do not have -- are not university hospitals, do

20

not have related medical schools.

They have been allowed from the beginning, and

21

They incur these costs directly, and what we

22

really have here is a distinction that is not based on

23

medical necessity and is not based on benefit to the

24

patient, and there is tremendous benefit to the patient in

25

being in a teaching institution.

If you have a serious medical condition,

certainly I would want to go to a teaching facility.

is where the best care is given, and I think the training

4

of these interns and residents is essential for continuing

5

to have high quality care in the country.

Now, if I could look specifically at the

7

regulations, the Secretary's position here conflict with

8

both the medical education regulation itself and with the

9

related organization regulation.

The medical education

10

regulation is quoted in relevant part at pages 9 through

11

11 of the AHA amicus brief.

The Government has --

12

QUESTION:

Is it quoted in your brief?

13

MR. SUTTER:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SUTTER:

16

The Secretary has focused exclusively on

Well, that is my brief.
Oh, I'm -The AHA AAMC amicus brief.

17

paragraph (c), but it is very important to read the

18

regulation in context.

19

mandatory provisions in there, paragraphs (a),

There are specific provisions,
(b), and

20

(g), and (a) says that providers are entitled to

21

reimbursement of net costs as calculated in (g), and (g)

22

describes the costs which are included and the revenues

23

which must be offset.

24
25

In contrast, paragraph (c) is phrased in very
general, descriptive, precatory language.

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

It would seem

1

very strange as a general proposition to construe that

2

language as imposing broad, draconian disallowances.

3

would seem particularly strange when (a) says that you --

4

you reimburse under (g), not (c), and (g) does not include

5

a cross-reference to (c).

6

But let's look at (c).

The Secretary has

7

construed that as establishing two principles, the so-

8

called redistribution principle and the so-called

9

community support principle.

The redistribution is based

10

on the last sentence, and the community support on the

11

prior sentence.

12

Let me begin with the redistribution.

13

sentence refers to a redistribution of costs, but it does

14

not define that term,

15

that there has

16

there has not.

costs were notdistributed in 1985 any differently

1

don't look to the billing practice, then I'm not sure how

2

the redistribution provision is ever going to be applied

3

in any consistent fashion when related organizations are

4

involved, because your argument in effect would be,

5

because it's a related organization, it doesn't have to

6

bill, and therefore nothing in effect is ever

7

redistributed because we just looked to the total entity.
MR. SUTTER:

8

9

That's not my argument.

My

argument is that you have a redistribution where you have

10

a situation where a hospital begins billing for costs

11

which in the past were incurred by an educational

12

institution for that institution's own educational

13

program.

14

which in the past it could not have billed for.

15

In other words, it begins billing for costs

So you say they can't bill for first-

year medical education, for example.

MR. SUTTER:

QUESTION:

20

That would be a

Absolutely.
It would also be clearly forbidden

by the statute.

21

Among the possible subjects of billing from the

22

school to the hospital, as a practical matter, will there

23

be any application of the redistribution limitation?

24

MR. SUTTER:

QUESTION:

There could be.

MR. SUTTER:

Sure.

If -- say there's a related

school has for many years provided classroom instruction.

It is part of the nursing school's program.

7

suddenly they decide ah, well, let's see if we can get the

hospital to claim these costs.

because that would be a redistribution.

11
12

QUESTION:

Why?

They are not

You couldn't do it,

Isn't that a related

institution, too?
MR. SUTTER:

No, because the nursing school was

13

not providing those services in the past as part of the

14

hospital's educational program.

15

is the hospital's educational program.

16

the hospital's educational program.

17

See, in this case, this
It has always been

The related medical school has provided services

18

in the past and in '85, but if you look at the related

19

organization principle, it says the related organization

20

is essentially the alter ego of the hospital.

21

You will find that in paragraph (c)(2), and the

MR. SUTTER:

10

I think only if you had some

activity that the medical school was conducting in the

12

past that was its own program.

QUESTION:

I don't -- I would have

But if it was strictly -- I guess my

15

problem I'm having is, if it were its own program in the

16

sense that I think you're using that term, then it would

17

not in fact be related to the teaching function of the

18

hospital, so once we get within the sphere of what is

19

related directly or indirectly to the hospital's teaching

20

function, I think the implication of what you're saying is

21

that the redistribution provision will never apply when

22

we're doing cost accounting within a series of related

23

entities.

MR. SUTTER:

All of those could be examples of something

that's provided by a related organization as part of their

4

own program which would be reimbursable under Medicare --

5

well, it wouldn't be reimbursable under Medicare if it

wasn't provided by a provider, so if you had it in some

7

other part, some other part of, say, the university, and

8

suddenly you try to shift that and make it a provider

QUESTION:

10

Any of those examples --

Yes, but the illegitimate shift that

11

you posit is illegitimate because it really is not related

12

indirectly to the provision of medical education by the

13

hospital.

14

I mean, the reason -- if I understand it, the

15

reason the attempt to shift the nursing cost fails is that

16

the nursing cost has nothing to do -- that the cost of

17

providing instruction in the nursing school is not

18

indirectly related to the provision of the medical

19

education which is subject to reimbursement under

Medicare.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY L. WAX

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MS. WAX:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Although petitioner tries hard to complicate

7

this case, at bottom its resolution requires answering two

8

straightforward questions.

9

Secretary's reimbursement rule for education costs as

The first is whether the

10

embodied in this regulation at issue is a legitimate

11

exercise of the Secretary's authority to determine

12

reasonable costs of medical care to patients that will be

13

paid by the Medicare program.

14

The second issue is whether the Secretary's rule

15

is an unreasonable construction of the terms of the

16

regulation itself under this Court's deference rules in

17

Chevron and Udall v. Tallman.

18

The United States submits that both of these

19

questions must be resolved in favor of the Secretary.

20

Secretary's rule is a perfectly reasonable rule in light

21

of the text and purpose of the Medicare Act.

had claimed them for the last 10 years and been allowed in

2

the past, that it would be allowed these costs?
MS. WAX:

3
4

It would depend on whether that

institution was an affiliated institution.
QUESTION:

5

Say it's exactly like this in all --

6

it's exactly like this institution in all respects, except

7

that it had always claimed the same costs.

8

MS. WAX:

9

giving me a hypothetical --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. WAX:

Oh, I see what you're saying.

You're

Yes.
-- of a different institution.

Yes.

12

The rule is that if -- when a cost is first incurred by an

13

institution, if that institution comes to Medicare and

14

says we don't have, obviously, an established source of

15

funding since this is the first time that we've taken on

16

these new responsibilities, we want you to help us pay for

17

them, then yes, the community support and redistribution

18

rule would allow Medicare to pay those costs.
If the institution didn't claim them, they found

19
20

some other source of funding, then they lose that claim

21

forever.

22

QUESTION:

And if this institution had claimed

23

these very costs 5 years earlier and done it each year,

24

would it get them this year?

a good thing overall to have a training program, although

it's not essential.

4

presence of interns and residents is essential to the

efficient delivery of medical care, because it isn't.

Congress did advert to this airy benefit that you're

to them only as inpatient hospital services.

did refer to them in the definitional section.

The way

To the extent that that definition implies that

18

there ought to be some sort of reimbursement for intern

2

intermediary has been applying those regulations correctly

3

since they were implemented, and the Secretary isn't going

to know about any problems unless there's been a denial of

costs and the provider appeals and is dissatisfied.
QUESTION:

6

Is that what happened in 1984 in this

7

case?

Because it is an anomaly that they woke up to one

8

cost in '84 and they were allowed reimbursement, and then

9

in '85 when they wanted more, they weren't.
MS. WAX:

10

Well, that seems to be what happened

in '84.

12

this case was kind of caught off guard.

13

What happened in '84 is that the intermediary in

The first part of the regulation

isn't at all that clear, though.
MS. WAX:

Well, no, we think that's clear as

5

well, but the point about the redistribution provision is

6

that it's a narrower provision that specifically applies

7

to this case, and this circumstance of a medical school,

8

an educational unit taking over costs.

9

The community support principle, although it

10

tracks in every respect the effect of the redistribution

11

clause, is a broader principle, and that in itself is also

12

sufficient to get the result in this case, and they both

13

have the same effect, which is that if there's a level of

14

community support that's been established, established by

15

the institution not going to Medicare and claiming costs,

16

then Medicare will presume that there's community support.

17

It will not pay those costs in the future --

18

it's a one-way ratchet -- and of course it will not pay

19

those costs even if there is a withdrawal of support,

20

because that would be a redistribution to Medicare, and

21

that is also forbidden by the plain terms of the

regulation, and also, we think, contrary to Congress'

Well, the fact is that one may

You could rebut it.
The presumption is raised by not charging

Medicare, but the provider, the hospital could rebut the

presumption by showing either that it ran a deficit hat

was tied to their program, or that the money was not

coming from the usual State and charitable sources, but

7

out of the pocket of patients, which we think probably

8

Congress did not consider community support, but apart

from that, any other source would be community support.
So to get back to Justice Scalia's point, there

10
11

is a rational policy behind this one-way ratchet, this

rule, which is, the Secretary on the one hand wants to

certainly doesn't want to come in and supplant and

the Secretary can show that that's vastly inflated, the

Secretary has to pay that.

That's the reasonable cost rule, and the fact is

massive shifting of costs that medical schools and

2

institutions have previously paid for by other means into

3

the base year amount for dozens of institutions, and the

4

bill is going to shoot way up.

5

There's going to be a massive redistribution.
QUESTION:

6

That's just a fact.

No, but you do agree, if I understand

7

your position correctly, that a teaching hospital can get

8

paid more for precisely the same services than a

9

nonteaching hospital.
MS. WAX:

10
11

It depends on what services you're

talking about.
QUESTION:

12

Well, just the cost of having the

interns participate in the training, and the education,

the whole thing.

hospital will qualify for a higher payment for precisely

16

the same services that would be available in a nonteaching

hospital.

MS. WAX:

There's a separate line -- there's a

19

separate provision for the reimbursement of education

costs, on the theory that that enhances care.

QUESTION:

But that's a response really to

22

Justice O'Connor's suggestion that there's an overall cap.

23

There really isn't as to teaching hospitals.

QUESTION:

Yes.
Thank you, Ms. Wax.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD N. SUTTER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. SUTTER:

5

I'd like to briefly address community support.

6

7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think it's important to analyze that a little bit.
Suppose in 1985 the hospital had received a

8

$10 million contribution from someone in the community.

9

Could that be offset as community support?

10
11

The answer is,

it could not be.
An unrestricted gift would never have been

12

offset from the beginning of the Medicare program, and

13

that was --by the ORA 1980 legislation that was made part

14

of legislation, and Congress encouraged the Secretary also

15

not to offset restricted grants.

16

says, this is specifically for GME.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

That is, a grant that

What do you mean when you say,

Congress encouraged the Secretary not to?
MR. SUTTER:

The -- in paragraph 3 of that

20

legislation, which is on page 1 of the reply brief,

21

Congress authorized the Secretary to not offset restricted

22

grants, and that is an encouragement which the Secretary

23

responded to in the 1983 Federal Register, so that now you

24

could have someone actually in the community donate

25

$10 million directly to the hospital, say this is for GME,

and that could not be offset.

2

QUESTION:

3

Well, Congress authorized the

Secretary to but didn't require her to.

4

MR. SUTTER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SUTTER:

But she did.
But she did.
She did, in 1983, so are we going

7

to say a $10 million contribution from someone in the

8

community is not community support, but somehow you're

9

getting services from a related medical school, and that

10
11

is community support?
Or you could have the medical school actually

12

giving $5 million to the hospital.

13

been offset by Medicare under section 607 of the Provider

14

Reimbursement Manual, which is on page 21a of the Ohio

15

State amicus brief appendix.

16

sense to say that these services constitute community

17

support, when those don't.

18

That could never have

I don't think it makes any

Now, I will say whatever rules apply to the

19

hospital should apply to the medical center.

If there's

20

something that the medical center receives that should be

21

offset if received directly by the hospital, then you

22

should have an offset.

23

here, and under the Secretary's current regulations, the

24

only thing that is offset is tuition, and interns and

25

residents do not pay tuition.

But we don't have that situation

Instead, they receive a

stipend.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sutter,

is the same charge that

3

you're contesting or claiming to make here also being made

4

against insurance payers and self-payers?

5

MR. SUTTER:

Well,

insurance payers don't

6

usually pay on a cost basis.

7

the medical education costs will be a component in the

8

hospital's charges, so the answer is yes.

9

QUESTION:

They will pay charges, and

The answer is yes?

10

MR. SUTTER:

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The case is submitted.
