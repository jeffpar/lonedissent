ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. WESTBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESTBERG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The petitioner in this case was convicted of the

11
12

rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl and has been

13

sentenced to death.

14

question in this Court is whether Miranda applies to

15

statements that he made during questioning in jail,

16

without Miranda warnings, and before he had been formally

17

arrested.

The question in this Court -- the

The statements were not by any means a

18
19

confession of guilt, but were incriminating.

20

issue here is whether the petitioner was in custody at the

21

time of the statements.

23

appendix.

1

at the hearing that the petitioner was not in custody in

order to show the admissibility of the statements.

3

trial court excluded, under Miranda, part of the

4

statements, but only the part that was said after

5

suspicion had focused in the policeman's mind on the

6

petitioner.

7

The

The trial court found that this happened at the

8

time that the petitioner described an automobile he had

9

borrowed on the night of the murder as a turquoise car.

10

The trial court made no findings of fact in this case at

11

all, other than as to the particular point in the

12

questioning that the suspicion switched to the petitioner,

13

and the California supreme court affirmed.

14

That court said that the trial court's finding

15

as to the point when suspicion focused on the petitioner

16

was supported by the evidence, and the court pointed out

17

testimony of the police officers that until that point

16

they would have let the petitioner go, had he requested.

19

I will try to cover three points this morning:

20

first, very briefly, the facts that we think are material

21

to the custody issue; second, to discuss this Court's

22

decisions, especially the reasoning of the decisions, that

23

show that the State courts used the wrong analysis of the

24

issue and also the factual elements that we think support

25

a conclusion that petitioner was in c .stody, and third to

demonstrate that the respondent's approach is unworkable

and has largely been rejected by this Court.
The material facts are quite simple.

10

friendly.

The police found two ice-cream drivers who had

11

been in the neighborhood on the day of the murder -- now,

12

13

to interview or question these men.

The petitioner was

17

they were told that he was not at home, but they went in

18

anyway and searched from room to room and found him hiding

19

under a bed.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. Stansbury, the question on which

21

we granted certiorari is whether a trial court can

22

determine that a criminal defendant is not in custody for

23

Miranda purposes on the basis of the police officer's

24

subjective intent that they didn't consider the defendant

25

a suspect.

MR. WESTBERG:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

That is correct.

We don't ordinarily go into extensive

review of facts.
MR. WESTBERG:

The extensive -- I'm not going

5

into an extensive review of the facts, Mr. Chief Justice,

6

but the issue as to what caused the suspicion to focus on

7

the defendant was, of course, the principal issue in the

8

court below.

The question for this Court is whether that

is the correct standard on which to determine custody.
10

In the case of the petitioner, four police

11

officers went to the petitioner's home.

12

about 11:00 at night.

13

holsters, in their hands, and they knocked at the

14

petitioner's door.

15

They arrived

They had guns drawn out of the

They told him that they wanted him to come to

16

the police station, and I can refer to the -- in the

17

appendix, there's a very brief description of what was

18

said to the petitioner at that time, and the significance

1

of this, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the test that this

20

Court has applied for determining whether there's custody

21

for the purpose of Miranda is whether a reasonable person,

22

in the standpoint of the defendant, believes that he has a

23

choice, and the facts that I am relating to you are the

24

facts from which we would conclude that a reasonable

25

person would not believe that he had a choice.

QUESTION:

1

Well, speaking for myself, I think

2

you're probably right about the standard that we have

3

enunciated, but again speaking for myself, I didn't think

4

the supreme court of California had departed in any

5

material way from it.
MR. WESTBERG:

6

I believe the supreme court of

7

California stated the issue at the beginning as whether a

8

reasonable person would believe himself in custody, but in

9

fact, the analysis that that court made of the facts were

10

focused almost entirely upon what was in the policeman's

11

mind.
They talked a great deal about facts that a

12

13

reasonable person, in the petitioner's mind -- reasonable

14

person in the petitioner's standpoint would know nothing

15

about.

16

instead of to the police station?

17

For example, why did they take him to the jail

They talked about difficulties getting into the

18

police station.

19

information that was available to the police before they

20

had gone to pick him up.

21

They talked about the nature of the

In other words, the California supreme court,

22

although it mouthed the standard of a reasonable person,

23

actually decided the case on the basis of the findings

24

that had been made by the trial court, and they found only

25

that the trial court's conclusion as to when suspicion

shifted to the petitioner was supported by the evidence,

2

and that until that point the police officers would have

3

been willing to let him go.
At the trial, all of his statements came in

5

through the point that he described the car.

6

used as substantive evidence of his guilt, and the jury

7

was instructed that if they believed that he'd made false

8

statements to the police, that could be considered as

9

evidence of consciousness of guilt.

These were

between the parties to the case that the lower courts

12

applied the wrong standard.

13

suspicion, the extent to which the police officers may

14

have suspicion of guilt -- it's a test which may have come

15

from the Escobedo case -- has been rejected by this Court

16

all the way back as far as the Beckwith decision in 425

17

U.S., and it was made explicit in Berkemer.

18

said specifically that the strength or content of the

custody.

The issue of the focus of the

the answer to the question presented is no?
MR. WESTBERG:

1

suspicion in the policeman's mind, the answer is no.
QUESTION:

2

So there is no dispute about the

3

correct answer to the question presented, and the only-

4

question is what we do from there on?

5

MR. WESTBERG:

I think that's correct.

6

In choosing the correct standard, I think it's

7

important that the Court be aware that we are not asking

8

to expand Miranda in any way, or expand the rights of

9

criminal defendants generally beyond what this Court has

10

already laid out in cases such as Berkemer and Beheler and

11

Miranda itself.
Berkemer and Beheler apply an objective

12

13

standard.

14

is whether a reasonable person in the position of the

15

suspect would have understood his situation, not whether

16

there's a formal arrest, and not whether the police think

17

he's in custody.

18

The only relevant inquiry in deciding custody

The police specifically rejected arguments that

19

the undisclosed intentions of the police are relevant,

20

because as a matter of logic, the police suspicions have

21

nothing whatsoever to do with the concerns that moved the

22

Court in Miranda, which were that the compulsive effect of

23

in-custody interrogation is inherently coercive, and as a

24

matter of policy, the Court also in Berkemer thought it

25

was not a good idea to have minitrials on the subject of

1

what is in the police officer's mind, which would be

2

decided primarily on self-serving testimony.
The principal difference between our position

3
4

and the State's, given that the wrong standard was used,

5

is that the State would look at each of the factors in

6

this case on what I might call a divide and conquer

7

approach.

8

this fact alone does not mean custody, put it aside, and

9

never think about it again.

10

That is, they pick up one fact, look at it, say

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't the appropriate thing

11

if the wrong standard was used, for us to say that's --

12

the rest of it should be redone by the California court

13

and not by us?

14

MR. WESTBERG:

Both the parties in the case

15

believe that this Court can determine custody on the basis

16

of the record.

17
18

I should point out that --

QUESTION:

But why should Court make the

determination - -

19

MR. WESTBERG:

20

QUESTION:

21

This Court need not --

-- that ordinarily would be made by

the California court?

22

MR. WESTBERG:

I don't think this Court need

23

make the determination.

Both parties have said to the

24

Court that they believe that the Court can determine

25

custody on this record.

However, I should point out that the burden of

1

2

proof being on the State to prove no custody, the issue

3

really is whether, on the facts that are in the record,

4

the Court could say, as a matter of law, that there was no

5

custody.

6

If the Court cannot say that, then the Court

7

could either determine there was custody, or remand it

8

back to the State courts to make that determination.
QUESTION:

9
10

follows from that?

11

Suppose - -

12

If there was custody, then what
What would be the bottom line?

MR. WESTBERG:

If there were custody, the bottom

13

line would be that it would go back to the State for a

14

determination, presumably, of harmless error.

15

California supreme court did not address prejudice from

16

this point, because it found there was no error.

17

affirmed the finding that if there had been custody it did

18

not - - the custody did not attach at the time of these

19

statements, so it let the statements in, and it explicitly

20

declined to consider the prejudice question, and I think

21

it would -- so there is an open harmless error question.

22

QUESTION:

The

It

Do you say that for Miranda purposes

23

it is irrelevant whether the investigation has focused on

24

the suspect, or are you just contending that in making

25

that determination we must use objective evidence only?

MR. WESTBERG:

The focus is material if it

influences what he thinks are his rights.

him, and he knows that he would not be free to leave, then

that of course is --

necessarily be conveyed to him, and in this case, there

the trial court didn't find that there was anything.
The trial court looked solely at what was in the

policeman's mind which was not communicated to the

suspect, and on the facts of the case, the policeman was

aware that they were looking for a turquoise car.
The suspect mentioned a turquoise car when

I don't -- the inference, clearly, is that he

2

saw the guns.

The petitioner did not testify, however, so

3

there is no testimony that he actually saw the guns.

4

question, I think, for the Court, is whether he could have

5

seen the guns, and if a reasonable person could have seen

6

the guns, then whether Mr. Stansbury actually saw them or

7

not is not the issue, because the question for the Court

8

is to examine the police conduct and examine whether the

9

police conduct was such that it would persuade a

reasonable person in the defendant's position that he was

14

have released him if he had asked to be let go.

15

is, he didn't ask to be let go, and they didn't release

him, and in fact after he described the car, he was given

17

a Miranda warning, and when he said he thought he needed a

MR. WESTBERG:

QUESTION:

I have it, Mr. Chief Justice.

It says, custody "occurs if the

any way or is led to believe, as a reasonable person, that

he is so deprived."

it seems to me that's considerable evidence that the

15

supreme court of California was adopting exactly the test

16

that you say should govern.

17

It's the perception of a

Ordinarily we defer to State courts'

MR. WESTBERG:

My answer to that, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, is that although the court made that statement on

19

page 471, the bulk of the discussion by the court of the

20

issue is whether there was substantial evidence to support

21

the finding of the trial judge about suspicion in the

22

policeman's mind focusing on the petitioner, and the court

23

deals at great length with that point.

24
25

The court does not find -- the court -- and the
California supreme court does not make findings of fact.

There was only one finding of fact -- there was only one

2

fact-finder here, and that was the trial court, and there

3

was only one finding of fact by the trial court, and that

4

was when suspicion focused in the policeman's mind.
QUESTION:

5

Well, but presumably the trial court

6

may have made implied findings when it declined to

7

suppress what it did suppress of the statements.
MR. WESTBERG:

8

9

The trial court actually did

suppress part of the statements, so you cannot draw a

10

conclusion that the court made a finding -- I would say

11

that the court made a finding that the petitioner was in

12

custody at the end of the interview, because it suppressed

13

what he said after he had described the car, and yet the

14

physical surroundings, the fact that the defendant was in

15

jail, had not changed, so we have a bizarre situation

16

where the court has found custody, but found that it

17

attached at a particular point in time, based on its view

18

of when the policeman's mind registered a certain level of

19

suspicion.
QUESTION:

20

Well, you don't contend there's

21

anything impossible about a person not being in custody at

22

the outset of the interrogation and being in custody later

There is one case,

The

18

we've referred to, which suggests that for purposes of

custody, you apply a slightly different test than you

would apply for purposes of seizure under the Fourth

21

Amendment, and that Berkemer was of course a traffic stop

Your Honor, we believe that the

essentially correct.
The first part of the inquiry relates to how

12

Stansbury got to the police station.

supreme court made a factual finding that he was invited,

15

not commanded, to come to the police station for an

Petitioner relies on this Court's opinion on

18

Dunaway v. New York, but in Dunaway, the State court found

1

"this case does not involve a situation where the

20

defendant voluntarily appeared at police headquarters in

21

response to a request of the police."

22

This Court declined to reconsider these State

court findings.

The nonthreatening nature of a police

He was never handcuffed, he was never booked prior to

its own precedents would be either to find that he was in

he was (a) in the jail and (b) he was in a situation where
