5

Environmental Defense Fund.

Mr. Rosenthal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE ROSENTHAL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

Incinerators that recover energy from the

12

burning of municipal solid waste, known as resource

13

recovery facilities, received an exemption from Federal

14

hazardous waste regulation under a 1984 amendment to the

15

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

16

presented here is whether that exemption ceases to have

17

effect once these incinerators actually burn the waste

18

sent there for incineration.

19

The question

The 1984 amendment is entitled, Clarification of

20

Household Waste Exclusion.

On its face, it requires some

21

understanding of what the household waste exclusion was,

22

and what Congress was seeking to clarify in 1984.

23

Accordingly, I will begin by examining the regulatory

24

framework that confronted Congress when it enacted the

25

statute, and I will then discuss the statute's purpose,

history, and its text.

2

I will leave the question of what deference is

3

owed to the views of the Environmental Protection Agency

4

on this statute to the United States.
In 1976, Congress first enacted RCRA, creating a

5
6

comprehensive scheme for the disposal of solid waste.

7

RCRA divides solid waste into two categories, hazardous,

8

and nonhazardous.

9

expensive, and cumbersome scheme for the disposal of

10

It creates a far more demanding,

hazardous waste.
In the statute, Congress delegated to the

11
12

Environmental Protection Agency the authority to define by

13

regulation what substances should be deemed hazardous.

14

Household waste poses special problems within this

15

regulatory framework.

16

household waste is nonhazardous, occasionally people do

17

throw away things that technically qualify as hazardous --

18

the used flashlight battery or the occasional can of paint

19

thinner.

20

QUESTION:

Although the vast majority of

Mr. Rosenthal, you seem to

21

acknowledge, then, that at the end of the day the ash may

22

contain material that under the ordinary definition would

23

be considered hazardous waste.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Given the posture we are in

today, yes, I think the Court -4

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

QUESTION:

And would you explain the scope of

4

your position?

You represent the city which operates its

5

own resource recovery facility.

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

7

QUESTION:

8

the end of the day?

9

That's correct.

And what does it do with the ash at

MR. ROSENTHAL:

The city contracts first with a

10

hauler to take the ash to a landfill and second with the

11

landfill, at which the ash is disposed.

12

QUESTION:

And the landfill is out of State.

13

MR. ROSENTHAL:

At one point in this case it

QUESTION:

Currently, the ash is being disposed of at lined

Not owned or operated by the city.
That's correct.

A private landfill.
It has a contract with the city.

Now, do you take the position that

21

the plain language of the statutes mean that there is an

22

exemption all the way down the line, even in the private

23

landfill and with regard to what the owner of the private

24

landfill does with the ash?

25

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I do, Justice O'Connor, and the

1

reason for that is because that is in fact what the

2

household waste exclusion was when originally promulgated,

3

and what was continued by Congress --

4

QUESTION:

I ask that because the statute, 6921,

5

refers to the exclusion for the resource recovery

6

facility, and what it does in treating, storing,

7

disposing, or otherwise managing the waste, and so do you

8

think it's clear from the plain language of the statute

9

that the exemption extends to down the line private

10

landfills?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

11

I think it is both from the

12

language of the statute and when it's placed in the

13

context of what Congress was trying to clarify.

14

course, in - -

15

QUESTION:

Of

Well, as I understood it, you make a

16

plain language argument, and I just wondered what the

17

plain language was that you thought covered the private

18

landfill.

19

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, it is the deeming clause,

20

because the statute says that the resource recovery

21

facility shall not be deemed to be treating, storing,

22

disposing or otherwise managing hazardous waste.

23

If you think that the hazardous waste

24

regulations apply when the garbage arrives at the landfill

25

because of the fortuity that we don't use our own

1

landfill, then at that point, as they dump the waste off

2

the truck, you would be deeming the city, or EDF does deem

3

the city to be disposing of hazardous waste at that point,

4

but the statute prohibits that result.

5

resource recovery facility shall not be deemed to be

6

disposing of hazardous waste, so - -

7

QUESTION:

It says that a

It seems to me you wouldn't be

8

deeming it to dispose of hazardous waste because it was

9

disposing of hazardous waste.

You don't have to deem a

10

darn thing.

11

at a certain stage they shall not be deemed.

12

is written in such a way as to say, don't treat them as if

13

they are doing this.

14

What the statute is saying is that at least

MR. ROSENTHAL:

The statute

That's correct, and what that

15

means, I take it, is that if you think that the resource

16

recovery facility -- in this case EDF argues that as the

17

employees of the resource recovery facility are sweeping

18

out the ash from the incinerator and trying to figure out

19

what to do with it, the employees are supposed to treat

20

that ash as hazardous waste and ship it and dispose of it

21

under those regulations.

22

QUESTION:

Well, there may be a period of

23

uncertainty as to when one regime ends and another begins,

24

but I don't see how you can read this as defining the ash

25

as nonhazardous waste as opposed to directing that the

1

recovery facility shall not deemed to be dealing with it,

2

and if you do not read this

3

it is not a definition of hazardous waste, nor is it a

4

provision saying ash is not, then at most, it seems to me,

5

you can get by plain language is that you don't treat the

6

ash as hazardous waste until it leaves the hands of the

7

recovery facility, but at that point, I don't see how

8

anything in this statute by its terms covers the ash.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

- - and in its plain language

Of course, the only defendant in

10

this case is the resource recovery facility, because I

11

take it even EDF doesn't think that Congress intended to

12

create an exemption where if the resource recovery

13

facility disposes of the material on site at its own

14

landfill, adjacent to the incinerator, Congress would

15

treat all that as exempt, but the fortuity that you

16

instead use an independent contractor off-site, that would

17

trigger a different result.

18

EDF apparently doesn't even think that

1

distinction makes any sense, and I think especially when

20

you put the plain language into the regulatory context, it

21

becomes quite clear, because when EPA defined by

22

regulation what was hazardous in 1 80, it bowed to the

23

practical reality.

QUESTION:
this chronology.

Mr. Rosenthal, one question about

groundwater because the residue might leach out of the

MR. ROSENTHAL:

EDS did the testing.

When did that occur chronologically?

Was it after the original EPA regulation?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

It was.

It was from 1981 to

1987, the tests relevant to this facility.
QUESTION:

So was it appreciated that the ash,

14

as distinguished from the household waste that went to the

15

incinerator, would have hazardous potential?

16

MR. ROSENTHAL:

The city had always taken the

17

position that the ash was not hazardous waste under the

18

EPA regulation.

19

test that in turn led to this litigation.

20

the regulation was promulgated, it said that the entire

21

household wastestream was excluded, up to and including

22

the ash, and it was explicit.

23

excluding the ash.

EDF questioned that, and that led to the

occurred after that initial exclusion, not before.

1

That's correct.

That's correct.

Then, in 1984, this statute was enacted.

The statute, of

course, is entitled,

Exclusion."

"Clarification of Household Waste Exclusion."

an existing construct, which was a wastestream exemption.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Well, Mr. Rosenthal, from '85 to '92,

was the official position of the EPA to the effect that
the ash was subject to subtitle C regulation?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

11

The official position in - - EPA

12

put out a statement in 1985 which by 1987, when Mr. Porter

13

testified before Congress they were already saying, our

14

position doesn't really make a lot of sense.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, is your answer yes, or no?
I'm not sure.

I think my answer

17

is that their official position was that they saw no

18

intent on the statute to reach the ash, but that they

19

weren't going to do anything about it.
QUESTION:

20

And what happened during that

21

interval?

comply with subtitle C?

23

Did they enforce subtitle C?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Never.

Did the city

brought an enforcement action against the city or any

2

other resource recovery facility, and after the

3

congressional moratorium on new EPA regulations expired we

4

found Administrator Reilly's ruling on this subject, which

5

repudiated the 1985 statement.
In short, given this context, a principle of

6

7

statutory construction comes into play which I think is

8

quite useful in resolving this case, that principle being

9

that Congress is deemed to approve of existing

10

administrative practices or constructions when it

11

legislates absent clear evidence to the contrary, and the

12

reason I think that principle is useful is because when I

13

look for the clear evidence to the contrary, I cannot find

14

any.
I cannot find any in the plain language of the

15
16

statute, which again is entitled,

19

two respects undisputed in this case, it was clarifying.

And of course, we need go no

further in this case than that.

3

QUESTION:

But first answer my question, will

4

you, before commenting on it?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

5

In cases like North Haven Board

6

of Education v. Bell, the Court has applied this principle

7

even when the Congress amends other portions of the

8

statute, but not the pertinent portion of the statute.
Here, of course, we need not guess, because

9
10

Congress explicitly put into the statute the Household

Waste Exclusion.

It is --

Was the EPA

It was not, because it was

19

issued pursuant to EPA's delegated power to define what

20

hazardous waste is, so it is written in terms of the

definition of hazardous waste.

"deeming," but I do take it that when Congress tells us

23

that what it thinks it is doing is clarifying the

Household Waste Exclusion, Congress should be taken at its

25

word.

QUESTION:

1

Well, maybe -- Congress sometimes

2

engages in the use of euphemism, and if in fact what

3

Congress did was to come up with a text which was in some

4

significant way different from what it purported to be

5

clarifying, we've got to give some significance to the

6

text, and it seems to me that one big significance is, EPA

said, ash isn't hazardous.

Congress is saying, when a recovery facility is

pretend it's not -- dealing with hazardous waste.

it is appropriate to take Congress at its word.

language of the text is less a clarification than a

have to be taken at their word.

that Congress should be read simply to be clarifying the

existing regulatory construct.

3

evidence further down in the statute that Congress

4

misrepresented the statute in its title, maybe there would

5

be a different result, but I don't think there is clear

evidence further down.

9

QUESTION:

If we can find clear

Well, aren't you confusing ratifying

with clarifying?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

I'm trying not to, because it is

10

clear that Congress did clarify in two respects that are

11

not in dispute, which I think is one of the reasons why

12

the language does not precisely track EPA's household

13

waste exclusion.

14

QUESTION:

But if you say, if Congress says

15

we're clarifying something, that suggests that the meaning

16

may have been indeterminate before, and that Congress may

17

be giving it at least a partially new meaning, whereas if

18

you say ratifying, that means that Congress is approving

19

the previous administrative construction.

20

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I quite agree, and it is our

21

view that Congress was clarifying, not ratifying.

22

fact, it was quite unclear under EPA's household waste

23

exclusion whether, if a facility also received

24

nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste in addition

25

to household waste, it would still qualify for the

5

That was entirely unclear.

if you also except nonhazardous

Absent some very clear indication that Congress

6

was not serious and should not be taken at its word when

7

it said it was clarifying, Congress should not be deemed

8

to have worked such a fundamental and far-reaching change

9

in the prior regulatory framework, and indeed,

if one is

10

looking for evidence of an intent to change the law - - not

11

to clarify it, but to change, to dramatically narrow the

12

previous household waste exclusion, one certainly cannot

13

find it in the legislative history.

14

In fact,

EDF's position on the legislative

15

history, of course,

16

at the legislative history,

17

clearly and expressly, and far from evincing an intent to

18

dramatically narrow the exclusion,

wastestream exclusion, goes on to say that resource

21

recovery facilities should be fit within the household

process should be removed.

will, you would have created a huge economic disincentive

2

to the resource recovery process without any evidence that

3

Congress intended to create this massive new regulatory

4

burden.
QUESTION:

5

The statute, counsel, has two

6

definitions, a definition of disposal, and a definition of

7

hazardous waste generation.

8

discrete categories or is there some overlap between the

9

two?

10
11
12

MR. ROSENTHAL:

In your view, are these

I'm not sure I understand your

question, Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me -- let me put it

13

this way -- that it's essential to your case to show that

14

the facility that treats the household waste is disposing

15

of the waste when it stores the ash on-site, or when it

16

ships it off, but then in other instances, other

17

facilities would be said to be generating a hazardous

18

waste when it did that.

19

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, of course, hazardous

20

disposal is a defined term.

It says,

"putting the waste

21

in land or water so that it could be exposed to the

22

environment," and in my view there is really only one

23

point in the process at which this ash is disposed of, and

24

that's when it goes to the landfill.

25

administrator Reilly notes in his ruling on the subject,

That -- and as

1

ordinarily the only hazardous waste that these facilities

2

dispose of is the ash.

3

QUESTION:

But hazardous waste generation is

4

also a defined term, and it does not seem to me that your

5

argument takes that into account, or that if it does, your

6

position must be that one of these exempt facilities can

7

be said to be disposing of wastes when other facilities

8

would be generating it.

MR. ROSENTHAL:
QUESTION:

Well, I --

It seems to me that you're saying

11

that there's an overlap between what the statute treats as

12

two discrete categories.

13

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, what we have here is a

14

situation where the precise act by which the ash is

15

generated, incineration, is already covered by the

16

statute, because that act is treatment within the meaning

17

of the statute, and Congress put treatment in, so it would

18

have been surplusage to also put generation in.

19

EPA's own household waste exclusion didn't use the term,

20

generation.

21

QUESTION:

Indeed,

Well, if you had another facility

22

that was not exempt, it would be proper for the Government

23

to say that the creation of the ash was hazardous waste

24

generation, would it not?

25

because of this particular construction that you give to

the exemption that the term, hazardous waste generation,

2

seems to become irrelevant.

3

you can do that consistent with the statutory scheme.

4

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I don't quite understand how

If the act of generating is

5

already exempt under another term that Congress put into

6

the statute, and in my view it is, it's already exempt

7

because it's treatment.

8

10

QUESTION:

But the legislative report did

include both words, did it not?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

It did.

I take it that the

11

author of that report, out of an abundance of caution,

12

because it was clear to the author of that report that

13

everything was exempt, put the word in, but the drafter of

14

the statute evidently worried that if surplusage was put

15

into the statute, that might create some mischief, track

16

the household waste exclusion, which itself did not use

17

the term, generation.

18

And I think if you look at the statute's

19

underlying purpose, this becomes even clearer, because of

20

course, Congress has told us what its purpose is.

21

enacted a purpose provision in RCRA.

22

purposes -- to encourage resource recovery, and reduce the

Nation's need for landfill space, and as Administrator

Reilly recognized, those purposes would be dramatically

undercut if the exemption didn't extend to ash.

1

Indeed, on EDF's view, this entire statute is

2

meaningless, because EDF believes that only the incoming

3

wastestream is exempted by the statute, but the incoming

4

wastestream was already exempt prior to the enactment of

5

this statute.

6

from household waste regulation under the EPA regulation,

7

and nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste by

8

definition was exempt, so on EPA's view, this statute is a

9

completely empty gesture.

10
11

All the incoming household waste was exempt

I submit that that is not a

sensible way to construe it.
QUESTION:

A couple of times, referring to the

12

landfill, you said the fortuity that the city didn't own

13

the landfill, is that -- is it common that the landfill is

14

independently owned and operated?

15

MR. ROSENTHAL:

It is frequent.

I don't know

16

which pattern is more common, but it is certainly frequent

17

that landfill space is owned by an independent contractor.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenthal, even on the least

19

generous view of EDA's position, the statute is not

20

completely useless, is it, because it does clarify the

21

significance of receiving nonhazardous industrial waste?

22

MR. ROSENTHAL:

It does not clarify that at all

23

if it only deals with the incoming wastestream, because

24

that incoming wastestream was already exempt because it is

25

by definition nonhazardous.

2

You mean, it was already exempt even

if it included both household and industrial nonhazardous?

3

MR. ROSENTHAL:

If it included -- if the

4

incoming wastestream included only household waste and

5

nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste, nothing in

6

that incoming wastestream would be subject to hazardous

7

waste regulation under RCRA, prior to 1984.

10

addressed more to whether ash itself should be treated as

a hazardous waste, which presumably would take it all the

12

way down the line, and I'm having some difficulty with

13

understanding how we interpret the statute as applied,

14

ultimately, to the private landfill.

15

MR. MINEAR:

One of the problems in this area

16

obviously is that EPA's household waste exclusion, which

17

it passed as a legislative rule in 1980, exempts a

18

wastestream from the time that the household waste is

19

picked up at curbside until it finds its ultimate

20

destination in an incinerator or a landfill.

21

Section 3001 (i) is in fact a facility or process

22

exemption instead, and EPA has attempted to reconcile

23

these two by in fact saying that we look at the matter

24

this way, and this is set forth in footnote 9 of our brief

25

on page -- footnote 6 at page 19.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Both the city and the United States, however,

nor does it purport to exempt the resource recovery

3

facility from the distinct generator requirements of

subchapter C.

5

Let's look at section 3001(i), the language of

it, and consider precisely what the city is arguing.

7

Right now, in Joliet, Illinois, there is a private

8

landfill disposal operator that is disposing of 180,000

9

tons of hazardous ash in a landfill that Congress deemed

10

not to have the safeguards necessary for the disposal of

11

hazardous waste.
Now, the city claims that that private landfill

operator is exempt from subchapter C.

RCRA is a complicated statute, but the pieces of

it are very clearly defined by Congress in the statutory

3

definition, and they fit together, ultimately, we think to

4

present a clear picture, and let me explain, Your Honor.

5

It's quite clear in section 3001 (i) that

6

Congress did not create what is deemed a wastestream

exemption.

the resource recovery facility itself.

9

can read that statute to create a subchapter C regulation

10
11

They did not exempt any facilities other than

for any other facility.
Because Congress is not creating a wastestream

12

exemption, Congress also clearly omitted from section

13

3001 (i) any exemption from the distinct generator

14

requirements under section 3002, which are distinct from

15

the treatment storage and disposal requirements which they

16

are exempt from under 3004.

MR. LAZARUS:

9

let me explain why.

If the city, for instance, as

10

suggested by Mr. Rosenthal, put a disposal facility on

doesn't purport to exempt any other activity that they

might attempt to engage in there.

lose its exemption with respect to the treatment of the

18

MR. LAZARUS:

It loses its exemption at the

moment the incineration resource recovery process is over.

20

The statute -- what it's doing, it means that although the

21

city is clearly treating the hazardous waste, and would

22

otherwise be subject to 3004 of RCRA, it doesn't have to

seek a section 3004 permit, because it is deemed not to be

Excuse me?

Does the kind of ash that proves to

separately to the RCRA from the household ash?

17

MR. LAZARUS:

It comes from the household ash

18

and it also can come from the nonhazardous industrial and

19

commercial waste, and that's because although the

20

industrial and commercial waste may be nonhazardous, they

21

may contain hazardous constituents, and those hazardous

22

constituents, because of the incineration process, do two

23

things:

1

that is, ash -- with a very significant surface,

2

percentage of surface on it and the surface matter of ash,

3

and the concentration which together caused the ash to

4

flunk EPA's toxicity characteristic analysis, which looks

5

to whether a substance is likely to leach in a landfill,

6

and it's because it's ash, because it's concentrated.

7

So the hazardous waste here could well come not

8

just from the household waste, the hazardous ash could

9

well come from the commercial industrial waste which has

10
11

hazardous constituents.

This is a fundamental chemical

It's one thing for Congress, Your Honor -- it's

12

one thing for Congress to have exempted a waste where, out

13

of 180 million tons, less than 1 percent is hazardous, and

14

not to require the municipality to sort through that.

It's a very different policy view, and it's an essential

MR. LAZARUS:

1

No, we're not questioning that.

2

It wasn't a wastestream exemption, though, that actually

3

would have applied to this case, because as EPA recognized

4

in 1985, in their preamble statement, right after RCRA's

5

enactment, that hazardous waste -- excuse me, that

6

exclusion only applied to the incineration of household

7

waste.

8

9

It didn't apply to the incineration of household
waste mixed with other kinds of waste, and that's why EPA

10

said in 1985 that under EPA's then-existing regulations

11

this ash would not be exempt, but wholly apart from that,

12

wholly apart from the gratuity in this case, that we don't

13

have a mixture, we think that Congress addressed the issue

14

for the first time in 1984 in 3001(i).

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, not silently, Your Honor.

19

congressional silence, this is a question of the plain

How about the city's argument that

6

when Congress legislates it's presumed to have ratified a

MR. LAZARUS:

9

Your Honor, in this case, first of

all that doesn't apply, because section 3001(i) -- excuse

10

me, the prior administrative construction wouldn't have

11

covered this situation, and that is a situation of the

12

mixture, and whatever presumption might exist, Your Honor,

13

that presumption is clearly overcome by the plain meaning

1

2

Well, does EPA need to promulgate a

rule if it decides not to regulate something?
MR. LAZARUS:

3

In a case like this, Your Honor,

4

where EPA had said in a prior interpretive rule in 1985

5

that its existing legislative rule made this ash subject

6

to subchapter C regulation, if the EPA is going to change

7

its interpretation of an existing legislative rule, it

8

should do it by a legislative rule, it shouldn't do it by

9

an interpretive rule, and this memorandum in this case is

10

at best an interpretive rule, because even interpretive

11

rules are supposed to be published in the Federal Register

12

under the Administrative Procedure Act, and this rule was

13

not.

14

Let me turn the Court's attention, though, just

15

for a moment to section 3001(b)(2) and (b)(3), because I

think those provisions truly became highlighted in

those provisions supported our position and not the

In those provisions, in section 300(b)(2) and

and that is, for waste associated with the exploration,

production, and development of oil and natural gas, and

significant procedural safeguards because of the

2

environmental risk associated with a wastestream exemption

as opposed to a facility exemption.

In particular, Congress required EPA to study

wastes.

comment on that issue.

Congress required EPA to hold a public hearing on
Congress required EPA to receive public
Congress required EPA, if it

decided to exempt those wastes as a wastestream from
10

subchapter C, to make a formal determination to that

11

effect, and to report that determination to Congress.
Now, what the city is seeking in this case is a

12

13

wastestream exemption far broader than that created by

14

Congress when it specifically addressed the issue, and

15

without any of the procedural safeguards that Congress

16

deemed necessary prior to the creation of a wastestream

in Joliet, Illinois.
We are not claiming that the city is disposing

3

of hazardous waste, because if you're disposing of

4

hazardous waste, you have to be discharge, depositing,

5

injection, dumping, spilling it or leaking it or placing

6

it on the land or water, and there's only one facility

7

which is doing that, and that facility does not enjoy the

8

benefit of subchapter C, and the city is violating the

9

distinct generator requirements under section 3002.

10

Because one of those requirements, in addition

11

to the testing requirements, the determination of whether

12

it's a hazardous waste, the labeling requirement, and the

13

manifest trapping system requirement, which is so

14

essential at the gatekeeper to let the downstream

15

facilities comply with subchapter C, is that the city --

16

also, as a generator, one of the requirements under

17

section 3002 is that the generator assure that the waste

18

is ultimately disposed not by them but by somebody else at

19

a RCRA-permitted facility under section 3004, and that is

20

the distinct generator requirement.

facility and said, well, this isn't just going to be a

resource recovery facility, this is now going to be a

landfill disposal facility, that they wouldn't be entitled

MR. LAZARUS:

No, Your Honor, we think that the

only thing that 3001(i) addressed was an exemption -QUESTION:

Well, you think that, but I'm not

sure that the language is clear on that point.
MR. LAZARUS:

Well, I think -- Your Honor, I

10

think the language was quite clear, and in all events the

11

language was quite clear that in no event are they

12

entitled to any exemption from the generator requirements,

13

and in no event is any other kind of facility entitled --

14

kind of facility there, such as a disposal facility.

QUESTION:

Well then, storing the household

15

waste prior to its combustion isn't covered, because that

16

is not a resource recovery facility recovering energy.

It's not doing anything.

MR. LAZARUS:

It's just sitting there.
Your Honor, I - - in terms of

You don't want us to go so far as to

11

MR. LAZARUS:

I would not object to this Court

12

giving section 3001(i) a narrow reading.

13

there is a settled canon of statutory construction in this

14

Court which we think is applicable here, and that is when

15

we're talking about a remedial statute, that exemptions of

16

the remedial statute should be narrowly and not broadly

construed.

QUESTION:

The fact is,

And how do we tell a remedial statute

from a nonremedial statute?
MR. LAZARUS:

Well, I think in this case, when

you have a statute designed to protect human health and

the natural environment, that is the paradigmatic case of

remedial statute.

I see my time is up.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE ROSENTHAL

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

MR. ROSENTHAL:

5

I'd like to first turn to the question whether

6

what we have here is a wastestream exemption, because no

7

one should mistake the boldness of what EDF is asking this

8

Court to hold.

9

Thank you.

EDF is asking this Court to hold that Congress

10

was misrepresenting when it crafted this statute, that

11

Congress in fact wasn't clarifying anything, that that is

12

a misrepresentation, that Congress intended to

13

dramatically narrow the scope of the exemption that these

14

facilities receive if they mix in, to use Mr. Lazarus'

15

words, any nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste.

16

The interesting thing about the record in this

17

case is it shows that 99 percent of what this facility

18

receives is household waste.

19

city mixes in 1 percent, or less than 1 percent,

20

nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste, Congress

21

would have intended a dramatically different result, would

22

have intended to end the wastestream exemption.

On EDF's view, because the

23

It is, as one of Justice Ginsburg's questions

24

noted, it is the resource recovery facility itself that

25

must find a way to dispose of the ash.

When that ash is

1

on-site, it is the resource recovery facility's problem.

2

How are you going to dispose of it?

3

to dispose of it as hazardous waste, and pay $453 a ton,

4

according to EPA's estimates, or can you dispose of it at

5

a more feasible cost of $42 a ton as nonhazardous waste?
For all these reasons, I ask the judgment be
