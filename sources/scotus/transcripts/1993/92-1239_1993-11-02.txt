ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. PORTER, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. PORTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A ruling which the petitioner requests in this

11

case is a determination that gender-based peremptory jury

12

challenges are prohibited under the heightened scrutiny of

13

the Fourteenth Amendment such that the procedures

14

established in Batson v. Kentucky would apply in that

15

context also.

16

The facts which are relevant to the review of

17

this case reveal that from a panel of 33 potential jurors,

18

the State of Alabama in this cause struck 9 -- used 9 of

19

its strikes to strike men from the jury and used 1 of its

20

strikes to strike a female.

21

peremptory strike to strike a male from the jury,

22

resulting in an all-female panel to try this case, which

23

resulted in a determination in favor of the state of

24

paternity in this action.

25

The petitioner used a

The position of the petitioner in this case is

1

based upon three factors.

2

principle which prohibits gender-based exclusion from the

3

jury venire also excludes gender-based elimination or

4

peremptory strikes in the formation of a petit jury.

5

The first is that the same

Secondly, under the heightened scrutiny of the

6

Equal Protection Clause applicable to gender

7

discrimination, the State's interest in limiting further

8

restrictions on the exercise of peremptory challenges is

9

not significant enough to overcome the invidious harm

10
11

caused by gender-based peremptory challenges.
And finally, the harm to the petitioner, the

12

excluded jurors, and society as a whole is substantially

13

similar in the use of gender-based peremptory challenges

14

as that we find from race-based peremptory challenges.

15

The fact that this panel ended up being all

16

female simply highlights the injury to the entire

17

community when a group, such as males or females, were

18

eliminated from the jury panel because of group bias or

19

unwarranted stereotyping, and when those -- that

20

stereotyping becomes the basis for the exclusion of

21

otherwise qualified jurors from the judicial process.

22

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that men at large

23

in this particular community really felt bad because male

24

jurors had been stricken from this panel?

25

MR. PORTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think at the

1

time, obviously, the community as a whole was not

2

cognizant of the problem.

3

felt excluded, because there were only 10 of them to start

4

with.

5

QUESTION:

The excluded jurors certainly

Well, supposing that the local

6

newspaper had run a story saying that these male jurors

7

had been excluded, do you think the community at large or

8

the community of men would have felt very badly about it?

9

MR. PORTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that

10

there would have been a perception that this was not fair,

11

for a panel of all one gender, whether it be female or

12

male, to try any particular case.

13

been the perception in the community, not necessarily that

14

men would have felt bad, but the community would have felt

15

that the system was not necessarily fair.

16

QUESTION:

I think that would have

So the community would have felt

17

differently than men would have felt about it, is that

18

your answer?

19

MR. PORTER:

I think men -- I would agree that

20

men would have felt excluded in this particular case.

21

I think in any particular case, if they were excluded

22

simply because they were males.

23

QUESTION:

And

But men, as a class, historically

24

have not been excluded from jury service, so why should an

25

equal protection plea on behalf of men succeed?

MR. PORTER:

1

Justice Ginsburg, men have not -- I

2

agree that men have not been excluded from jury service.

3

But men have become -- under the Equal Protection Clause,

4

have been a classification which have received protection

5

from gender-based discrimination.

6

the same principle which applies to gender-based

7

discrimination in general should apply to males, and to

8

females, in this particular context.

9

QUESTION:

So our position is that

Well, why couldn't this be regarded

10

as a kind of affirmative action for women to make up for

11

all the years when Alabama totally excluded them from jury

12

service?

13

MR. PORTER:

I'm not saying that that at some --

14

for some reason could not be.

15

certainly not an affirmative action because it would also

16

apply to females.

17

excluded.

18

women had been excluded from the jury panel.

19

it is not an affirmative action type of process which is

20

allowed by the State of Alabama.

21
22

It is a -- in this case men were

The same invidious harm would have occurred if

QUESTION:

So therefore

Mr. Porter, you speak of unwarranted

stereotyping.

23

MR. PORTER:

in a rape case, you're likely to be worse off with an

2

all-female jury and you're -- if you're a defendant in a

3

paternity case, you're not likely to be worse off with an

4

all-female jury?

5

stereotyping or unwarranted stereotyping, or is it simply

6

not true?

7

You don't -- is that warranted

MR. PORTER:

Justice Scalia, I would say that it

8

is unwarranted because that while men and women are not

9

the same, obviously, and do not have necessarily the same

10

outlooks, but they do have the same ability to be

11

unbiased, to become unbiased jurors in a particular case.
QUESTION:

12

The same ability -- they can both

13

fight against it to the same degree, as every human being

14

has to, but they begin from different standing points on

15

certain issues such as those two, don't you think?

16

you telling me that a defense counsel is unreasonable in

17

attempting to strike women in cases of those type, in

18

thinking that his client would be better off with a male

19

juror?

20

MR. PORTER:

Are

Justice Scalia, my response is

21

that, and our position is that simply because -- a woman

22

is excluded from a jury because of her gender should be

23

unwarranted and unreasonable.

MR. PORTER:

QUESTION:

Our position is that the -Are you saying that there's nothing

4

to the fact that a woman juror and a man juror, at least

5

in certain type of cases, may have a different outlook and

hence be more likely to tend towards the defense or the

prosecution side?

to that?
MR. PORTER:

Justice Scalia, I'm not saying

there's nothing to that.
QUESTION:

11

However, the --

You're saying there is something to

12

it, but counsel shouldn't be able to take that into

13

account in their peremptories?

14

MR. PORTER:

I think that you can consider that.

15

I don't think that -- our position is that you should not

16

be able to exclude a male or a female simply because of

17

their gender.

18

females are --

There are studies that goes both ways, that

QUESTION:

19

Mr. Porter, isn't it clear that

20

there's something to most stereotypes, that most

21

stereotypes are, indeed, accurate for a good part of the

22

class?

MR. PORTER:

Justice Ginsburg, stereotypes are

stereotypes, and they may, in fact, be applicable to a

1

percent of the women may feel one way about a subject.

2

But there are 40 percent that do not feel the same way,

3

and if you allow gender-based peremptory challenges, that

4

40 percent may be excluded simply because of the overall

5

perception that women feel a certain way.

14

Isn't that what peremptory challenges

MR. PORTER:

Peremptory challenges traditionally

15

have been allowed and become a part of our judicial system

16

because of counsel.

17

during the trial, that a certain juror may or may not be

18

biased in this particular case, and says -- therefore

peremptories are allowed.

the preconceived notion, the preconceived stereotyping

that all women feel a certain way and so therefore they

argument as opposed to a merely fact argument?

4

MR. PORTER:

Don't you have a principle

Yes, sir, Justice Souter, we do.

5

And that is in its -- probably its finest form, or the

6

simplest form, our argument; that stereotyping for the

7

exclusion of jurors should not be allowed.

QUESTION:

I've never seen anybody

However --

It is perhaps the difference that in

race and sexes, you don't have to ask.
MR. PORTER:

6

Correct.

It is clear from looking

7

at a person their race and their sex, and so therefore

8

there is that connection, so that it is something that you

9

can readily observe.
QUESTION:

10

Counsel, suppose an attorney were

11

faced with a jury of all one gender, all male or all

12

female, could the attorney then strike in order to

13

increase diversity?

MR. PORTER:

Justice Kennedy, in the race arena

where counsel have in the past stricken for that cause, it

the objection would be to the individual challenge of the

QUESTION:

5

in answering Justice Kennedy's question, that there is no

reason to infer that there was stereotyping or exclusion

which would be objectionable.

QUESTION:

Although you have standing because of

22

the client that you represent, which you're asserting,

the cases that followed, certainly my client would have

the standing to raise the objection of the excluded

3

jurors.

I think that would be correct.
QUESTION:

4
5

Well, isn't that the heart of your

argument?
MR. PORTER:

6

It is.

I think that's the overall,

7

the more broad argument.

8

probably, harm is the harm to the community and to society

9

and to the excluded jurors who basically do not have the

And the more important,

opportunity to raise the objection themselves.

So if you're the defendant in a

Yes, sir.
We've seen a number of cases here in

peremptories directed at minorities, of blacks or

hispanics.

12

making any sort of a peremptory challenge in a proceeding

is just really running a great risk.

peremptory challenge is going to be even to a man or to a

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
For nearly 2 decades the Court has held that

16

Government action taken on the basis of gender is subject

17

to heightened constitutional scrutiny.

18

heightened scrutiny, the discriminatory use of peremptory

19

challenges to remove a juror on the basis of gender

20

violates the Constitution.

21

In light of that

The line of cases beginning with this Court's

decision in Batson has made it clear that the use of

unconstitutional.

a whole.
The same is true with respect to gender-based

2

3

strikes.

4

gender is frequently the victim of an outmoded stereotype.

5

Jury manuals, for example, have instructed litigants to

6

remove women because of a belief that they are too

7

sympathetic or are governed by emotion, and the case law

8

reflects that this has happened.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, this Court has determined

8

that the Equal Protection Clause not only applies to

9

sex-based classifications, but that they are entitled to

10

heightened scrutiny because there has been a history of

11

discrimination and a history that reflects the misuse of

12

gender-based stereotypes as a basis for Government action.

13

And it's that Court's determination in the general

14

mainstream of equal protection law that we rely on in

15

urging the extension of Batson from race-based challenges

16

to gender-based challenges.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, if you -- if you

prevail here, if the petitioner prevails, and not only

MS. BRASFIELD:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, I agree

with that.

I also think that if Batson were extended to

problems in Alabama and in many States.

6

that Alabama is unique in struggling with the practical

application of Batson even as it applies to race, as --

and I think that having it to apply to gender also would

nature of the prima facie case.

As so members -- so many

2

members of the Court have pointed out, you can't strike

May I ask you a question about your

procedure in Alabama, this alternate striking?

correct that -- I gather a lot of these are peremptory

you can have strikes for cause as you go down the line,

MS. BRASFIELD:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

Is it

In this

case there were 36 on the original panel; three of them
were struck for cause by the court.
QUESTION:

I

see.

And the person just doesn't

lose -- and then he gets another strike if the judge

13

agrees with him on the strike for cause.

14

MS. BRASFIELD:

That's right.

That doesn't

enter into it.

The actual peremptory strikes begin after

the removal of the people who are struck for cause.

QUESTION:

As -- would you describe again what

19

test in Batson cases the Alabama courts are now using?

Because, I mean, it seems to me that one of the

consequences of adopting the rule that the petitioners

22

want here, would be to compel Alabama to be less rigorous

in its application of Batson.

24

required Alabama to apply such a rigorous rule.

the rule they now use?

I'm not sure that we have

What is

1

MS. BRASFIELD:

The proportion of minorities to

2

the majority race on the venire is considered as one of

3

the elements.

4

they might consider other matters.

5

It's not the only one; in individual cases

But there have been cases in which the very fact

6

that either more strikes were used against the minority

7

than against the majority or that the result was that --

8

for instance, if you had eight strikes and you used two of

9

them against blacks, but there were only two blacks in the

10

panel, and so -- or three blacks in the panel -- so that

11

you reduced the proportion considerably, that would be one

12

of the things they would look at in determining a prima

13

facie case.

14

facie case.

15

That, in itself, could be considered a prima

QUESTION:

And one could hardly afford to apply

16

that rigorous a rule to another category of strikes, or at

17

least another major one as sizeable as sex discrimination.

18

MS. BRASFIELD:

I think that that is true.

I

19

think that there would have to be some other way to handle

20

it, and I am not prepared to say what that could be as far

21

as -- as applying Batson, how that could be done.

22

there are other situations that have been done.

Now,

23

One thing I want to mention is that as well as

24

the community at large not being harmed, because men and

25

women both sit on the juries, and because these particular

1

men and women did not feel excluded from the system

2

because, they probably sat on another jury during the same

3

term of court, and because they were actually struck in

4

fairly equal numbers, the fact is that under the facts of

5

this case and the overwhelming evidence that was there, it

6

is very hard to see how the defendant could be harmed.

7

Because I don't think he was found to be the

8

father of this child because of a biased all-female jury;

9

I think he was found to be the father of this child

10

because of the overwhelming evidence that he is.
QUESTION:

11

Justice O'Connor explained that

12

the -- one of the problems from your point of view is that

13

the right is being asserted by the defendant, but the

14

constitutional protection is afforded to the potential

15

juror.

16

defendant is or is not likely to be affected, it's the --

17

it's the harm to the potential juror as a result of

18

stereotyping because of one's birth status, that's the

19

constitutional injury that's at stake here.

So every time you're talking about, well, the

MS. BRASFIELD:

Yes, Your Honor.

I understand

21

what you're saying, I think, but I feel that in this

22

particular case, in the first place they are struck by

23

number and the jurors don't know what their number is.

24

one side is striking men and the other side is striking

25

women and then are reduced in equal numbers, then I do not

If

1

see how they can be harmed by that knowledge.

2

I think that part of our problem in Alabama may

3

be contributed to by the fact that we use the struck jury

4

method, which gives us this basically unlimited number of

5

strikes, limited only by the number that's on the panel to

6

begin with.

7

already recognized that Alabama is having problems and is

8

having too many appeals on this issue, and they have

9

appointed a panel of -- a committee of judges and lawyers

The State of Alabama Bar Association has

10

to examine Alabama's jury system and see if going to a

11

different or a revised peremptory strike method, such as

12

is used in the Federal courts or some other court, might

13

alleviate a lot of the problem.

14

I think that there are other States who don't

15

seem to be having particular problems with Batson or with

16

gender strikes, and have been able to work this out.

17

QUESTION:

So if there is a constitutional

18

injury and it's a problem of the mechanics of the State

19

system that could be fixed, as seems to be your -MS. BRASFIELD:

20

Then I think Alabama deserves an

happening.

Well, certainly, there would be an

impetus to fix it if the Court said that Batson applies to

I'm sorry, I wasn't -- perhaps I

didn't understand you correctly.

You said in places that

implementing Batson, either for sex or for race, the way

11

Alabama is because it's got this unusual struck juror

12

system.

13

MS. BRASFIELD:

14

So that if you -- if you fixed the

QUESTION:

MS. BRASFIELD:

But I --

I thought that's what you had said.
Yes, that is what I said, but I

the State should have the opportunity to try to correct it
