ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE A. MANSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MANSON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the court of appeals held that

11
12

public officials risk substantial liability if they

13

terminate employees based on believable reports of

14

insubordinate remarks, substantiated by two other people,

15

witnesses to the conversation in question, if other

16

witnesses later come forward and convince a jury that the

17

employee actually spoke on matters of concern to the

18

public.

19

Although it - - although it expressly rejected

20

Churchill's claim of a right to due process under the

21

First Amendment, the court of appeals nevertheless held

22

that an employer unaware of protected speech because of an

23

inadequate investigation may be held liable for

24

retaliatory -- retaliatory discharge, regardless of what

25

the employer knew at the time of the termination, and even

if its lack of knowledge was accidental.
This unpreceded holding conflicts with this

3

Court's requirement that protected speech be a substantial

4

or motivating factor in the termination decision for a

5

constitutional violation to be found.

6

evidence in this case, none at all,

were informed that Cheryl Churchill had discussed issues

of public concern on January 16,

in that department, Melanie Perkins-Graham.

There is no

Thus the

10

defendants could not have intended to retaliate against

11

Churchill for her allegedly protected speech when they

12

made the decision to terminate her employment.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Manson, do you mean no evidence

14

on the record as it now stands?

15

on the question you're now arguing,

16

you get summary judgment, do you?

17

wouldn't it be open to the plaintiff then to show that,

indeed,

QUESTION:

21

MR. MANSON:

Your Honor -- I'm sorry.
Yes.
Your Honor, we believe that under

22

the Celotex case and the rules of rule 56 (e) on summary

23

judgment, that when the moving party moves for summary

24

judgment and the burden of proof for a particular issue is

25

on the nonmoving party, it is incumbent upon the nonmoving

1

party to present evidence that would sustain a jury

2

verdict in that party's favor.
And so what has happened here, we have moved for

3
4

summary judgment.

We have said that all the reports of

5

protected speech that we - - I'm sorry, all the reports of

6

speech we heard about that conversation on January 16

7

related to personal grievances, and that there is no

8

evidence to the contrary.
In fact, Your Honor, in the district court

9
10

respondent conceded and said that they had no doubt that

11

the report submitted by Mary Lou Ballew, who was the

12

employee that overheard the conversation, and Melanie

13

Perkins-Graham, who was a cross - trainee to which Cheryl

14

Churchill spoke that evening -- the respondent -- the

15

respondent had no doubt that those reports to the

16

first-level supervisor, Cindy Waters, and the director of

17

nursing, Kathy Davis, could be construed in such a

18

fashion, that is as unprotected speech.

19

on page 29 of our brief.
QUESTION:

20
21
22

That citation is

Could be construed, but not had to be

construed.
MR. MANSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

23

the burden on the respondent in this case is to bring - -

24

is to present evidence to the court that could sustain a

25

jury verdict in her favor.

Pursuant to rule 56(e) and the

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't she have her own

evidence of what she said, and wasn't there anyone else?

Was it only those two people?

concerned -- was a matter - - on a matter of public

concern?

And weren't there preceding

Your Honor, with regard to the

speech that night, yes, Cheryl Churchill does have her

10

version of what she said.

11

for there to be a violation of the First Amendment, the

12

defendants must be motivated by knowing of protected

13

speech, and our argument here is that all the defendants

14

knew about was comments of personal matters, grievances

15

against the supervisor.

16

QUESTION:

But our contention here is that

And you say there's no credibility

17

issue at all involved in that, that it's open and shut,

18

that all that the defendants knew about was that she was

19

grousing?
MR. MANSON:

20

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

21

person that overheard the speech has been deposed several

22

times.

23

those reports.

24

cannot be motivated against public speech if they don't

25

know about it, and all they knew about was unprotected

1

speech.
Let me give you an example of what they were

2

3

told.

For -- first of all,

the employee that overhead the

4

speech said that Churchill had talked to the cross - trainee

5

about the problems in the department to the point where

6

the cross-trainee wasn't interested in working there

7

anymore.

8

efforts in an understaffed department to try and get

9

additional people trained there.

This is sabotage of the employer's training

The witness was then asked:

10

"And what impelled

11

you to make that report?"

12

employee that overheard the conversation,

13

the OB Department was a good place to work and I hated to

14

see people who wanted to work there being turned off by

15

it."

16

to know that," meaning the supervisor to whom she reported

17

the speech.

18

detrimental effect on the department.

19

foiled the attempt to get somebody in the department that

20

could help with staffing."

21

She then was asked:

And she said:

And Mary Lou Ballew,
said:

the
"I thought

"Why did you think she needed

"I thought it had a
I thought it had

That's what impelled this employee, who

22

overheard the conversation,

23

Then we turn to the employee herself, the cross - trainee

24

that was the subject of this speech.

25

overall message was not a positive one as far as Cheryl

to go to her supervisors.

She said that the

7

1

Churchill's relationship with her immediate supervisor,

2

Cindy Waters.

3

gist of the conversation was negative feelings between

4

Cheryl Churchill and her immediate supervisor, Cindy

5

Waters.

She said at her deposition that the general

She said in the -- in the -- it's reflected in

6

7

the notes of her conversation with Kathy Davis, the

8

director of the nursing area, and Cindy Waters, the

9

director of that unit, that she recognized that --at the

10

end of that conversation she said:

11

hospital cannot tolerate this kind of negative attitude."

12

So we had -- we had these reports from both the

13

cross-trainee to which Cheryl Churchill spoke, and we had

14

the report of the employee that overheard the

15

conversation, an employee working in an understaffed

16

department of the hospital who, perhaps because it's

17

understaffed, has to take more on call or work weekends.

18

And we had those reports and that is the only information

19

that could possibly motivate the employer.
QUESTION:

20
21

"I know that the

How did it come out later that those

reports were inaccurate?
MR. MANSON:

22

If the reports were inaccurate,

23

Your Honor, we still believe that under the Connick

1

was the basis on which the employer learned more later?

2

MR. MANSON:

The employer did not learn more

3

later, Your Honor, until this lawsuit was filed.

4

Churchill was confronted when she was terminated, by Cindy

5

Waters and Kathy Davis, with the fact that she was being

6

terminated for general insubordination and for a

7

conversation with a cross - trainee on the evening shift for

8

15 or 20 minutes.

9

I asked - -

She did not respond at that time.

QUESTION:

10

Cheryl

When

Well, she -- she responded at the

11

grievance hearing and she wasn't allowed to put in her

12

evidence.

MR. MANSON:

Your Honor, I do not believe that

that is what the report of that conversation by Cheryl

17

would like to talk about three things.

18

warning you received in August for insubordinate action.

19

Secondly, the evaluation that you received in January,

20

where there were comments about her insubordination.

21

third, about the conversation with the cross - trainee.

22

in her own notes, reflects of that

Mr. Hopper started that meeting off by saying,
First of all,

Cheryl Churchill did not avail herself of that

23

opportunity, but instead wanted to tell Hopper what was

24

wrong with a nursing unit of the hospital.

And so we

QUESTION:

1

Well, if she had been allowed to do

2

that, isn't it likely that it would have come out that

3

that was, in fact, part of the substance of the

4

conversation that -- that was -- that is at issue here?
MR. MANSON:

5

It is possible, Your Honor, that

6

if, in effect, the defendants had forced her to give her

7

version of the events, that might have happened.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Well, it's possible that if she had

allowed to discuss the subject that she wanted to discuss,
that it would have come out too, isn't it?
MR. MANSON:

11

I suppose that it's possible, Your

12

Honor.

But we would -- we would submit that even in that

13

event, the hospital could still lawfully have terminated

14

this employee.

15
16

QUESTION:

Well, is your theory that good faith

is an absolute defense?

17

MR. MANSON:

Your Honor, our theory is that in

18

order for there to be a First Amendment violation, the

19

employer's action must be motivated by protected speech.

20

So it's not really good faith -QUESTION:

21

Suppose the employer has a rule that

22

you have to have a permit before you hold a meeting in the

23

cafeteria.

25

employer fires the person because they didn't have a

1

permit, but the employer's wrong, they did have a permit;

2

what result?

3

MR. MANSON:

I think if the -- first of all,

4

Your Honor, I think that deals more clearly with the prior

5

restraint rulings of this Court in terms of an overbroad

6

rule and if the rule is appropriate.

7

QUESTION:

No.

Assume it's a valid time, place,

8

and manner rule.

9

meet in the cafeteria; that's a valid rule.

10
11

You have to have a permit before you
Let's at

least assume it is.
MR. MANSON:

We believe -- Your Honor, we would

12

submit that whatever the result in that case -- and I'm

13

not sure, but that the effect here is that under Mount

14

Healthy the employer has to know that there -- and has to

15

be acting on the basis of protected speech for there to be

16

a violation of the First Amendment.

17

QUESTION:

Well, under -- under my theory,

the -- under my hypothetical, the employer acts under a

19

mistaken assumption of fact.

MR. MANSON:

In fact, the employee was

We would say to that, Your Honor,

that that would not be a violation of the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

I should think so.

That has to be

24

your answer, that that employer is guilty of a wrongful

25

firing, and it would be a wrongful firing of somebody who

wanted to have a meeting with a proper permit for a matter

2

of public interest, just as it would be a wrongful firing

of somebody who wanted to have a meeting on a different

subject.

5

me, that it's no First Amendment violation, it's just a

6

wrongful dismissal.

But you have to take the position, it seems to

7

MR. MANSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

That is correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Manson, you've spoken several

times, as you did in your brief, about the need to prove

10

that the -- in effect, the motivation of the employer was

11

retaliation against protected speech.
Now, our cases have gone into motivation when

12

13

the issue has been was the - - was the reason for the

14

discharge something that was unprotected, as opposed to a

15

response to that which was protected.

16

held that retaliation is, in fact --an across-the-board

17

retaliation for protected speech is, in fact, a

18

requirement for liability?

19

MR. MANSON:

But have we ever

I believe, Your Honor, that's what

20

the

21

that -- in that case was not protected speech, and so it

22

was deemed that it was not a violation of the First

23

Amendment.

would be Rankin v. McPherson, where the employee was

day that President Reagan was shot, and in the middle of

4

that conversation the employee says if they go for

5

again -- him again, I hope that they get him.

6

that case the Court can agree or not agree as to whether

7

that particular item of speech is protected or not, but I

8

think that the - QUESTION:

9

And this was on the

Now, in

But the issue in that case, as I

10

understand you, as you have just phrased it, is whether,

11

in fact, the impetus for the employer's action was the

12

protected speech or the remarks about the success of the

13

assassination attempt.

14

when the contest in the case is between what was the

15

cause, it doesn't follow from that that we have pronounced

16

an across-the-board rule that retaliation against

17

protected speech -- in other words, an intent test as

18

opposed to an effects test is always going to be the test

19

here.

20

does hold that.

21

But it doesn't follow from that --

And I'm -- I'm not sure that we have a case that

I believe, Your Honor, that that is

the -- the holding of Mount Healthy and Connick.

believe it comes from the Arlington Heights --

MR. MANSON:

was the second prong.

and that is we don't even get to the but-for causes.

4

QUESTION:

It was, Your Honor.

Mount Healthy

We're arguing the first prong here,

No, but my question is do we have

5

cases that discuss the first prong as a requirement

6

totally independent of the issue that arises with the

7

second?

8

as recently as Simon & Schuster, we're talking about an

9

effects test.

And, I mean, for example, we've -- to counter it

We said we don't care what the motivation

10

was here.

11

it strikes me as odd that we would have an entirely

12

different standard in the context that you're dealing

13

with.

14

It's the effect that we're concerned with.

QUESTION:

And

Mr. Manson, I understood you to say

15

that what you're talking about is the mistake as to the

16

content of the speech.

17

the content of the speech, that it didn't contain

18

anything -- any matter of political concern, not -- are

19

you talking about motive at all in that respect?

talking about a mistake as to the words that were spoken.

as to the words that are spoken.

15

were protected -- and we contend that she did admit

her supervisor, she did -- but what we say is that even if

you take her version, Cheryl Churchill cannot contest the

fact that this - - these other reports were given to us and

We believe, Your Honor, that in the

describing what one of the witnesses said was going to

happen to personnel, but there's no evidence that that

really happened.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. SEAMON

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

12

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. SEAMON:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

The United States supports petitioners on both

16

the First Amendment issue and the qualified immunity issue

17

in this case.

18

the court of appeals was wrong when it held that it is

19

irrelevant whether the petitioners knew, at the time of

20

Nurse Churchill's discharge, that she had engaged in

21

protected speech, i.e. speech on a matter of public

22

concern.

On the First Amendment issue, we think that

23

That holding is wrong because under this Court's

24

decision in Mount Healthy, an employee must show both that

25

she engaged in protected speech and that she was fired

because of the fact that she engaged in protected speech.

2

If the hospital did not know that she had engaged in

protected speech, it could not have been motivated by that

fact.

QUESTION:

Mount Healthy was a case in which the

contest was a contest as between motivations, wasn't it?
MR. SEAMON:

Yes, Mount Healthy was most

accurately characterized as a mixed-motive case.

directly addressed the question presented here, whether

Why would

14

mixed motive make a difference if motive doesn't make a

difference?

respect that we think the court of appeals was wrong.

difference?
MR. SEAMON:

Motive clearly is relevant, and

Mount Healthy establishes that much.

4

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't -- couldn't it make a

5

difference if, in fact, there -- there would be a

6

compete -- there was a competing justification, and the

7

question is whether that justification was the operative

8

one, as opposed to a justification of retaliation against

9

protected speech.
MR. SEAMON:

10

Yes.

And that -- that was the

11

focus of the court's concern in Mount Healthy, and that

12

gave rise to the sort of two-part showing that has to be

13

made and the affirmative defense that's available to the

14

employer.

15

But what -QUESTION:

I still -- I still don't

It seems to

17

me the inquiry in Mount Healthy was whether the motive for

firing was the unlawful motive.

MR. SEAMON:

QUESTION:

That's right.
And the assertion was, well, there

21

may have been mixed motives and -- but, still, doesn't it

22

assume that you have to prove the bad motive?

MR. SEAMON:

Yes.

exactly correct, to say that Mount Healthy -- the

MR. SEAMON:
QUESTION:

10

I can't remember what it was.

Isn't that right, that was the

That's correct.
She did have a bad personnel record.

11

Here there is no question about the fact that she was

12

fired because she made a particular group of statements on

13

a particular date, which they didn't realize were

15

because she made a particular speech which they say was

protected.

17

MR. SEAMON:

But she was clearly fired

It may be more accurate to say that

18

she was fired based on the reports of what she had said.

19

And in that sense, the speech formed the basis.

QUESTION:

Well, but the speech is the -- is --

MR. SEAMON:

believe that Justice Scalia's correct to characterize

forward that claim?
MR. SEAMON:

3

The situation in Federal employment

4

is generally that whether the employee is a probationary

employee or a nonprobationary employee, she would have the

opportunity to get notice of the reason why she was being

discharged, and in certain circumstances an opportunity to

Take a nonprobationary employee.

Apart from the administrative process, would there be any

judicial review?

14

MR. SEAMON:

Yes.

The employee would first go

15

to the agency and then to the Merit Systems Protection

16

Board, and the decision of the Board would be reviewable

17

in the Federal circuit.

frequently, and the Federal circuit rules on those.

Yes.

There is -- in some

situations where the issue is covered by a collective

bargaining agreement, there's an opportunity for

arbitration.

And, in fact, it may be that ultimately it's

the arbitrator's decision that goes to the Federal circuit

Must that be allowed?
It certainly should not, in our

view.

the Court:
I'd like to say one thing by way of

11
12

introduction, if I may, please.

This case, more than any

13

case decided since Pickering by this Court, presents

14

public employee speech in a context in which I think --

15

although I've done no empirical study on the matter, in

16

which I think public employee speech is most apt to take

17

place.

18

That is speech during a break time or break

19

period, dinner hour, or whatever, when employees in a

20

public agency talk about the policies of the public

21

employer, talk about the policies of the agency itself,

22

talk about how the policies of the employer are conforming

to or in furtherance of or sustaining the mission of

MR. BISBEE:

Didn't the Seventh Circuit say

Your Honor, the problem with the

Seventh Circuit's opinion, to the extent that there is

one, is that after doing a very careful analysis of the

It

Well, I'm not sure it disregarded

it was about the cross-training issue, might that not be a

valid cause for discharge?

Justice O'Connor's question is, even assuming that

Does every employee of a -- of

a public hospital have a right to go about running down

11

the hospital to subordinates simply because that employee

12

doesn't like the way the hospital's being run, and that is

13

a public issue and therefore it can be done constantly?

MR. BISBEE:

MR. BISBEE:

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And would you agree that one of those

rules might be that you don't criticize the hospital

during the middle of an operation, of a surgical

6

operation?

7

MR. BISBEE:

I agree.

But that didn't happen in

8

this case.

The only -- the only circumstance that

9

happened in this case was done by Cindy Waters herself,

10

who interrupted a surgical procedure to start ordering

11

people out of the room, when the surgical procedure was

12

underway, being performed by a doctor, no less.

13

the doctor attempted to reprimand the nurse, this Cindy

happened?

I want you to tell me, as far as that's concerned, how

that can be squared with a qualified immunity, with the

very reason for being of a qualified immunity doctrine?

If a person acts on the basis of credible but ultimately,

didn't want to have the temerity to suggest that the writ

15

had been perhaps improvidently granted, because there's a

16

lot of effort that's involved in that.

17

that the record simply doesn't support that question.

18

I know I've been arguing for 25 or maybe 27 minutes, now,

19

on that point.

And

And you did raise -- you did so argue

in your brief in opposition.

But it seems to me

Pardon me?
You did so argue in the brief in

opposition.
MR. BISBEE:

Yes, Your Honor, I did.

I

what the record in this case shows.

some trepidation --

QUESTION:

That isn't

And I say that with

But it certainly is what -- it

certainly is what the Seventh Circuit held.

Seventh Circuit has used language here that says it

doesn't matter what the motive is.
MR. BISBEE:

I mean, the

The Seventh Circuit used language

that was broader than it needed to.

The Seventh Circuit

10

used language that was broader than the analysis the

11

Seventh Circuit used.
QUESTION:

12

Well, then maybe we need to send it

13

back, because they seem to be operating on a legal theory

14

that even you aren't here defending.

15

MR. BISBEE:

16

think you have to send it back.

17

can affirm the judgment and say that the legal test

18

employed by the Seventh Circuit was not altogether

19

correct.

20

That is basically correct.

I don't

It seems to me that you

I mean, I'm not arguing -QUESTION:

Well, do I -- do I understand your

21

theory to be that if the employer acts on a premise that's

22

factually incorrect, but is nonetheless reasonable in

23

reaching its conclusion, that a discharge of the

24

employee -- and that's in those circumstances -- is not a

25

violation of the Constitution?

MR. BISBEE:

1

That's what I've argued, if the

2

employer is reasonable.

But that takes into account the

3

content, the context, the form of the speech.

4

into account -- the procedures, as you have pointed out,

5

are necessarily implied by the First Amendment itself when

6

speech is at issue.

7

QUESTION:

That takes

Sort of a negligence standard.

So if

8

an employment -- if an employer is negligent about finding

9

out what the conversation was, he's guilty of a

10

constitutional violation?

MR. BISBEE:

Absolutely not.

We're talking

Well, Your Honor -I don't see any difference between a

reasonableness standard and a negligence standard.
MR. BISBEE:

19

I disagree.

I think the objective

20

reasonableness standard that's been imposed by this line

21

of -- by the line of decisions in this Court culminating

22

in Anderson v. Creighton and Hunter v. Bryant, is far

23

different.

which indicates that there has been an abuse of

governmental power, that a reasonable governmental officer

I've read Anderson v.

with this Court's decisions in things like Daniels v.

not actionable.

difference between your standard for liability and your

standard for qualified immunity?

MR. BISBEE:

You know, under the facts of this

case they come awfully close to merging.
QUESTION:
what you said?

Why -- why didn't they just merge in

I thought they did.

MR. BISBEE:

I -- that's what I was -- we're

21

talking here about a mixed speech motive case.

22

why, in response to Justice Kennedy's questions, I say if

23

the information that the -- that the employer has is

24

reasonable that the speech is unprotected and

25

insubordinate, the employer is justified in discharging.

there's no reinstatement?

As opposed to damages?
I didn't say that.

I don't know the answer to that.

11

I didn't say that.

I don't know.

But all I'm talking --

Well, can we explore what the answer

might be?

12

MR. BISBEE:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
Do you think there's a distinction

14

between employer's liability for reinstatement and the

15

employer's liability for damages under 1983?

16

MR. BISBEE:

17

QUESTION:

I don't think so.
This model would apply across the

18

board as far as the city is concerned?

19

foggy question -- where there's a difference between the

20

standard for damages and the standard for judgment.

21

MR. BISBEE:

That's also a

Well, yes, I think the

That's correct, Your Honor.

MR. MANSON:

I would strongly urge this Court

17

that this matter should not be sent back on remand, but in

18

fact that summary judgment was appropriate in this case.

19

In response to Justice Souter's comment, we have

20

conceded, for purposes of summary judgment, that Cheryl

21

Churchill's version of what she said that night is

22

correct, but that was not what was reported.

23

under Connick is that if an employer reasonably believes

24

that an employee grievance has occurred, insubordination,

25

then the employer can act to terminate the employee.

And the test

In the Connick case it is said that a public

employee gets no greater First Amendment rights for a

personal grievance than does a private employee, and we

that the belief was reasonable?

MR. MANSON:

The district court held, Your

Honor, that under either version of the --of the case,

that the point of the speech, the employee's point of the

14

speech -- because Cheryl Churchill admitted, in addition

15

to her -- in her version of the speech, that she talked

16

about nonprotected items, namely her evaluation and her

17

thoughts concerning the manager of that unit.

And what the employee that overheard the

19

conversation said was the overall message was not a

20

positive one as far as Cheryl Churchill's relationship

21

with Cindy Waters.

told me she and Cindy Waters didn't get along.

23

said that Cindy Waters had said that they should wipe the

24

slate clean in that evaluation session, and Cheryl

25

Churchill told Cindy Waters it wasn't possible to do that.

She discussed the evaluation.

She said Cindy Waters didn't do much, and that the general

gist of that conversation was negative feelings between

Cheryl Churchill and Cindy Waters.

We contend that is not, in any way, protected

speech.
