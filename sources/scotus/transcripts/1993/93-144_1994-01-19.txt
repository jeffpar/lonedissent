ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court:
QUESTION:

Counsel, before you get underway,

16

straighten me out on a fact or two.

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Does Montana have an

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

Was this income subjected to that tax

as well as to the marijuana tax?
MR. VAN TRICHT:

I do not know, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So you don't know whether it was

MR. VAN TRICHT:

We do not know, no.

I do not

know.
QUESTION:

Is that hard to find out?

MR. VAN TRICHT:

In fact, it is, because under

Montana law I can only have access to Montana income tax
records if I am prosecuting an income tax case.

We have a

very strict confidentiality provision which basically says
that I cannot go down, and out of curiosity, or even in
connect -- conjunction with another case, look at the
income tax returns.

It's similar to the Federal, although

we have a fire law to protect the confidentiality of the
income tax returns.
QUESTION:

Well, I'll ask opposing counsel then.

QUESTION:

Could I ask you a slightly different

question, following up on Justice Blackmun?

Would --

under the Montana income tax law, would it be appropriate
for this taxpayer to pay an - - file an income tax return
and pay the tax, whether he did it or not?

Is he subject

to the law?
MR. VAN TRICHT:

Under the Montana income tax

law the Kurths, the family or the individual members of
the family, would be subject to income tax on the income
earned from growing marijuana.
QUESTION:

Even if it was illegal income, it

would still -MR. VAN TRICHT:

Even if it was illegal income.

It's identical to the Federal law.
QUESTION:

3

Before you say good morning and begin

your argument, I'll have one more question.

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

Would there be a violation, a

6

criminal violation for failure to pay the tax that's

7

involved here?

8

MR. VAN TRICHT:

This tax?

QUESTION:

Is there a separate crime for

Yes.

the failure to pay this tax?
MR. VAN TRICHT:

11
12

in the code.

13

provision, yes, Your Honor.

15

There is referenced in the code a criminal

QUESTION:

14

There is a criminal provision

So there could have been a criminal

prosecution here for failure to pay the tax?
MR. VAN TRICHT:

16

Under my understanding of the

17

Montana interpretation of double jeopardy, I don't

18

think -- under the State rule, I don't think that would be

19

possible.

20

QUESTION:

Thank you.

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me, would not be possible?

22

MR. VAN TRICHT:

As I understand Montana's

23

Supreme Court's interpretation of the --of our double --

24

constitutional double jeopardy provisions and the Montana

25

constitution, I don't think it would be possible.

From people who have been growing

marijuana, you sort of trust them to come up with it.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

9

You -- well, Your Honor, this

10

brings up one point.

11

in the Leary case and Marchetti, it is -- we cannot really

12

compel the filing of a tax return without running --

13

potentially running a file of self-incrimination.
QUESTION:

Under this Court's prior decisions

But you can put them in jail if they

I mean.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

Oh, we can only actually

17

enforce it if -- we can only actually bring an enforcement

18

action if there's not a payment of the tax assessment.

19

Your Honor, Montana has a tax of $100 an ounce

20

on marijuana.

The tax assessment before this Court is

21

$181,000 because the Kurth family had possessed 100 --

22

1,800 ounces of marijuana.

23

rather quite simple; is the tax a tax or a penalty and is

24

this - - and does this particular tax assessment violate

25

the Kurth's rights under the double jeopardy provision of

the Fifth Amendment?
The lower Federal courts held that the tax was a

2

3

penalty and that this assessment did violate the double

4

jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment.

5

stands in contrast and in conflict to a prior Montana

6

Supreme Court decision that held that this tax was not a

7

penalty and therefore could not violate the double

8

jeopardy provisions.

9

This decision

Montana - - the lower Federal courts based their

10

decision on this Court's decision in United States v.

11

Halper.

12

decision does not apply because this tax is a true tax and

13

not a penalty, and we believe it's a true tax based upon

14

two factors:

15

tax and, two, this Court's past decisions on similar tax

16

upheld Federal taxes of a similar nature.

Montana's basic position is that the Halper

Now, because --

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Van Tricht, just as a matter of

19

Montana procedure, why wasn't this tax made part of the

20

plea and sentencing proceeding, the criminal proceedings

21

against the Kurth family?

22

MR. VAN TRICHT:

By the time --by the time --

23

the assessment procedures had not been completed by the

24

time there was the criminal sentencing proceedings.

25

there was a contest.

tax assessment, the Kurths contested that assessment, and

2

administrative proceedings began before the Department of

3

Revenue which would have resulted in a final decision.

4

That -- those -- that process was never completed.

5

The Kurths filed bankruptcy and the Montana

6

Department of Revenue filed a proof of claim and a motion

7

for relief from the automatic stay.

8

then we went into the adversary proceedings.

decision upon the last -- on the assessment itself,

That was denied and
So by the

So there was no

It sounds, from what you describe,

14

that it is - - it would not be the common pattern to have

15

the two merged.

MR. VAN TRICHT:

In my experience they have

never been merged.
QUESTION:

If they were merged you wouldn't have

a problem, I assume.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

Well, actually merger would

21

create a great deal of problems because we're talking

22

about an apples and oranges proceeding.

So you could have -- if

you had the two together, you could have negotiated both

at the same time and had them -- you wouldn't -- I don't

understand what the impediments would be if you didn't --

10

if you were dealing by a plea rather than trial.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

11

Well, the impediment in this

12

case was the fact that we hadn't completed our assessment

procedure.

14

itself had an initial assessment and then the proceedings

15

would have gone on through a - - through an adversary

proceeding before a hearing officer of the Department,

which would have resulted in a final assessment.

QUESTION:

So we

Mr. Van Tricht, if the legislature in

21

Montana had passed its law saying that anyone found in

22

possession of marijuana, that there will be a civil

23

sanction imposed of $100 an ounce, do you think then we

24

would be required to look at the Halper decision to

25

determine its validity?

MR. VAN TRICHT:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, because --

Do you think it makes any difference

that precisely the same thing is done, only it's called a

MR. VAN TRICHT:
there's a different --

Yes, I do, Your Honor, because

Why?
There's a different intent by

In one action they're intending to

10

create a tax, in another act they're intending to create a

11

penalty or sanction.

12

13

QUESTION:

Well, I don't see how the change of a

word could alter the analysis?

14

MR. VAN TRICHT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. VAN TRICHT:

I believe --

Calling it a sanction or a tax.
I believe it does in this case,

17

Your Honor, because of this Court's past decisions which

18

upheld similar or nearly identical Federal taxes.

19
20

QUEST ION:

Do you think we could ever view a tax

as a sanction?

21

MR. VAN TRICHT:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

So it isn't just the use of the word.
No, Your Honor.

It's the

24

structure, the entire statute itself that the Court has to

25

analyze in the determination of whether it is a tax or a

And in this

and the Court also has to look

2

at past -- its past decisions on similar Federal taxes in

that analysis.
QUESTION:

4

Why doesn't the reference to

structure go against you?

6

for a supposed tax to have two different valuation

7

provisions and say we'll pick the one that brings in the

8

most?

9

Isn't it a very odd structure

That's not the usual structure for a tax.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

Your Honor, it's -- it's not

10

the normal structure, but there's a least one Federal tax

11

that has the same structure, and that's the tax on small

12

cigars which is 12.5 percent or $30 per thousand cigars,

13

whichever is greater.

QUESTION:

Is that so.

punishment?
MR. VAN TRICHT:

2

For the purposes of analyzing

3

under Halper, it makes a difference, Your Honor, because

4

we're dealing about the Halper decision and Halper was

5

talking about penalties and not taxes.
QUESTION:

6

7

But Halper also said it was a very

narrowly confined decision.

8

MR. VAN TRICHT:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So, why -- why don't you take the

10

position that even though there may be some sanction or

11

penal effect, if there's -- if it's also arguably a tax,

12

you win?

13

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Well, Your Honor, this Court

14

has often recognized that a tax has both regulatory

15

and -- effects and not -- effects other than its -- just

16

its purely revenue-raising effect.

17

certain aspects in a tax which to some people may seem

18

nontax.

19

the purpose of discouraging alcoholic consumption.

20

don't think that that -- that that is a collateral issue

21

which does not change the basic intent of Congress or the

22

legislature to enact the revenue-raising measure.

Is there

proceeding?
MR. VAN TRICHT:

3

Your Honor, the taxable -- the

4

taxable event is the coming into possession of the

5

marijuana.
QUESTION:

6

7

The coming into possession of

marijuana?

8

MR. VAN TRICHT:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

And is he allowed to retain

10

possession of the marijuana or does the State take

11

possession of it when it finds it?

12

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Well, if the State became aware

13

of the possession, then it's contraband and it would be

14

seized, unless there was some --

15

QUESTION:

But you couldn't -- obviously

16

couldn't tax it without being aware of it, so I suppose

17

that as soon as it has the right to tax it also has the

18

right to seize it.

19

on his prior possession, or is it taxing on something that

20

he no longer owns?

21

some - - an ad valorem property tax on something that the

22

person is not permitted to own.

23

And then is it on -- is it being taxed

It's a little bit unusual to be taxing

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Well, Your Honor, Montana fully

24

recognizes this is an illegal activity that it's taxing,

25

and the statute's structure fully recognizes that and the

1

rules recognize that.
QUESTION:

2

So it's a tax on the prior -- the

3

fact that he previously owned the marijuana.

4

the time you levy it, you already have the marijuana, I

5

gather.

6

MR. VAN TRICHT:

7

QUESTION:

Because at

Yes, yes, yes.

So you're -- he's being taxed for --

8

because of the fact that he previously had in his

9

possession marijuana?

10

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

And,

12

QUESTION:

How do you apply a -- how,

I see.
in theory

13

at least, should you apply a possession tax on something

14

which is growing when the tax is not keyed to a given day?

15

I mean every time his plant comes up with a few new shoots

16

should -- in theory, should he file a tax return?

17

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Well, Your Honor,

if he had a

18

plant and it grew to a certain, you know -- a pound, he

19

would owe a tax.

20

a tax on that additional pound.

21
22

23

If it added another pound, he would owe

QUESTION:

So the taxable event is the accretion

of a pound of weight to his agricultural product.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

We tax the possession once and

it's -- and each time -- each new possession of a

25

different amount of marijuana -14

QUESTION:

MR. VAN TRICHT:

There's no - - once the tax is due on the

4

old marijuana, there's no additional tax on that

QUESTION:

6

So in theory literally every time a

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Yes, sir.

Could the State generate additional

3
4

Well, Your Honor, this

I'm glad I don't have to administer

this tax.
MR. VAN TRICHT:

5

Your Honor, this brings up one

6

point.

We tax the dried weight of the marijuana at this

7

point.

We have --we had an extended bit of litigation

8

upon whether we were taxing the wet or the dry weight of

9

marijuana, and we tax the dry weight.
QUESTION:

10

But this -- there's one portion of

11

this, what you call shake, where it's at 800 percent, the

12

tax, is it not?

13

applicable to the marijuana and the rate applicable to the

14

shake, is that not so?

15

There was a disparity between the rate

MR. VAN TRICHT:

Your Honor, the Kurths were

16

producing two -- they had 1,800 ounces of marijuana.

17

that 2,000 -- 200 ounces were what's called bud marijuana

18

which was sold at wholesale at $1,800 a pound.

19

remainder -- and it was sold in smaller retail

quantities

in small quantities.

Of

The

The remainder, the 1,600 ounce, the remaining

24

1,600 ounces was shake, and that's the stems and the

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Halper against the United States this Court

4

extended the Double Jeopardy Clause for the first time to

5

civil measures, but the Court made clear that it is not

6

the case that any civil obligation, including fines, money

7

damages, attorneys fees, court costs, all of which can

8

carry the sting of punishment, as the Court recognized,

9

from the standpoint of the defendant -- the Court made

10

clear that it is not the case that any of those things are

11

punishments for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

12

Rather, it's only when a civil measure cannot be

13

explained in terms of a nonpenal purpose, it is only in

14

that case that it should be seen or can be seen as

15

punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

The Court said -- it was labeled a penalty.

we're -- that doesn't raise a double jeopardy problem.

And, in fact, I believe the case was remanded to the

if there is any -- to the -- contrariwise, to the extent

that there is any penal purpose, it is invalid, and that

Just as someone selling -- as we say in our

question posed by Justice Scalia, I think, merits an

2

answer from our perspective, and that is can a tax be

3

called a tax and serve a dual function?

4

is the consequence?

5

And if so, what

Well, I think both Halper and Austin were quite

6

clear on that point.

My position is you can call

7

something it a tax, it can raise revenue and therefore it

8

can be a tax, and it can also punish, and it can be

9

punishment for the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

10

And Austin said precisely on that dual-purpose

11

point, fundamentally, even assuming that the statutes in

12

question there served some remedial purpose, the

13

Government's argument must fail.

14

they're quoting now from Halper -- a civil sanction that

15

cannot be fairly said solely to serve a remedial purpose,

16

but rather can only be explained as also serving either

17

retribution or deterrent purposes, is punishment.

Because the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits

Now, turning to the question posed by Justice
Stevens, the answer is that -- and Mr. Van Tricht I think

10

made this point -- that although this is called a tax on

11

possession, this is contraband and it would be seized at

12

the time the Government realizes that the person possesses

Turning to Justice Ginsburg's question on the

quantities of the shake, what happened here is they

They have it at

such a high rate because they know that not many of these
marijuana growers are caught, and therefore although they
would like to impose a tax on all the marijuana, it's

QUESTION:

MR. GOETZ:

Well
That's a reasonable call.
One could argue that that's

reasonable, except there's no provision made, as I see it,

5

for reporting this marijuana tax.

6

when, A, there's no return form produced by the State;

and, B, it's not due

9

the State could avoid, but if you report it then it's --

10

Why would one report it

until a specified date, that is

then you incriminate yourself.
So while that argument could be made, I think in

12

the whole range of the incident and the structure and

13

application of this tax, it's simply, I don't think, a

14

very persuasive argument, particularly when we return to

the fundamental principle we're talking about here; is any
