CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The question before this Court is whether

12

Government may demand the dedication of real property as a

13

condition of development approval, without showing that

14

there is a reasonably proportional relationship between

15

the dedication and the actual adverse impacts of the

16

development.

17

In the case that we have today, the City of

18

Tigard demanded that Mrs. Dolan dedicate 10 percent of her

1

real property, and the City did that without showing any

20

proportional relationship whatsoever.

21

failure of the City in requiring that dedication to show

22

the proportional relationship violates the Fifth and

23

Fourteenth Amendments, because it takes private property

24

from her for public use, without payment of just

25

compensation.

We submit that the

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, are you going to comment

2

on the question of whether the City would have been within

3

its rights to deny the building permit entirely?

4

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we would agree

5

that the City would have been within its authority to deny

6

the permit outright.

7

might raise a different takings question that's outside

8

the realm of dedications and municipal exactions, and not

9

only that, that -- no, Your Honor, we are not.

10

11

QUESTION:

However, that -- that of course

We -- we take the case on the

assumption that the City could have denied it?

12

MR. SMITH:

13

And one of the problems that we have is if -- if

14

all that is required in a threshold inquiry for dedication

15

to meet constitutional muster is that the -- the

16

Government could have denied the permit outright, and

17

never reach the question of whether there is the essential

18

nexus or the requisite proportionality, then there is

19

really no textual meaning that I believe is given to this

20

Court's opinion in Nollan, and there is no fulfillment of

21

the -- the mandate in Armstrong v. United States, that

22

individuals should not be singled out to bear public

23

burdens that, in all fairness and justice, should be borne

24

by the public as a whole.

25

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

The -- the City really demanded Mrs. Dolan's

longstanding plans for park -- for a park and for a

pedestrian and bicycle pathway.

4

any regard to the actual impacts of her new store.

5

And it did that without

The City's so-called findings in this case were

6

made up after the fact, and were mere speculation and

7

conjecture.

8

9

And the City --

QUESTION:

Well, so far as the finding about the

flood plain is concerned, there was a finding that if you

10

pave over with asphalt things that have been previously

11

green or growing in some way, you're going to have a more

12

rapid runoff.

13

speculative to me.

14

Now, that -- that doesn't seem very

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, there is indeed

15

common sense to tell us that if one increases the amount

16

of a per -- impervious surface on a piece of property,

17

that there will indeed be more runoff.

18

agree with that.

19

this was well pointed out by Justice Peterson of the

20

Oregon Supreme Court in his dissenting opinion below --

21

that there was never a quantification of exactly how much

22

water would run off.

23
24
25

We would certainly

However, the problem is -- and I think

And as Justice Peterson characterized it in his
dissent, how much, a thimble full?
In the absence of any quantification of the

1

amount of water that would actually run off of a site, and

2

comparing that to the overall amount of water that could

3

run off from other structures throughout the City that

4

increased impervious surface, there is really no way for

5

the -- the City to come up with a fair apportionment of

6

the -- of the cost that should be imposed on Mrs. Dolan.

7

QUESTION:

So, you say the City has to -- has to

8

quantify something like that, do some sort of empirical

9

studies that would show the portion for which this

10

increase in her usage -- or her increased pavement is

11

responsible?

12

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

In fact, I believe that the City itself

14

recognized that that was the way to go.

15

record that's before this Court, at Docket Number F, at

16

pages 810 and -- and 811, it shows that the City, in the

17

detailed study it did of storm water runoff, that its

18

consultant commended to the City and urged the City to do

19

a calculation on the total amount of impervious surface

20

that would occur within the City at buildout, and as the

21

people proposed development, they should calculate the

22

specific development's contributions to that impervious

23

surface and to use that relative fraction to apportion

24

cost.

25

QUESTION:

creating impervious surface closer to the flood plain

2

causes more of a problem than creating impervious surface

3

further away from the flood plain?

4

MR. SMITH:

5

QUESTION:

No, Justice Scalia, there is not.
And yet, people who did that further

6

away would not have to dedicate any of their land to the

7

public use?
MR. SMITH:

8

9

That is correct, Your Honor.

That,

in fact, there are a number of properties that are not

10

located on Fanno Creek itself in the City of Tigard that

11

in fact may generate more storm water runoff than

12

Mrs. Dolan's proposed new store.

13

QUESTION:

But, in fact --

But isn't there -- excuse me -- isn't

14

there some sort of attenuation?

15

miles from Fanno Creek and pave over 2,000 square feet,

16

surely it's a lesser immediate effect on the creek than if

17

you are right along the creek and pave over 2,000 square

18

feet?
MR. SMITH:

19
20

I mean, if you're three

Yes, Your Honor, we would agree with

that.
QUESTION:

21

Assume that the additional runoff

22

would require that some vegetation remain alongside of the

23

creek.

24

are nevertheless excessive?

25

Is it your position that the demands of the City

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

And the reason is, is that the City has already

1

2

established regulatory restrictions on what can go on

3

inside that 100-year flood plain.

4

already prohibited from engaging in developmental uses of

5

that 100-year flood plain.

6

in question, it is highly unlikely that -- that anything

7

could go on either.

And the Dolans are

And considering the geography

It's a very, very steep bank.

So, the fact of the matter remains is there is

no development that's going to go on within the 100-year

12

It couldn't go on within the 100-year flood

QUESTION:

When we hear about the greenway, is

13

that simply part of the bike path, of is that also part of

14

the flood plain?

15

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, that is part of the --

16

the flood plain.

17

dedication of all land within the 100-year flood plain for

18

a greenway to fulfill its plan to link up a network of

19

parks, both upstream and downstream.

20

What the City required was the

In addition, they required the dedication of a

21

15-foot wide strip immediately adjacent and east of the

22

boundary of the flood plain for construction of a

23

pedestrian and bicycle pathway.

24

would increase impervious surface in and of itself.

And

storm drain that the City contemplated establishing in the

future.

QUESTION:

Well, would it be your position that

additional runoff and there is a relation between that,

that you're entitled to keep vegetation that's other than

she cannot do now?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, there are a number of

3

non-developmental uses to which she could have put the

4

land in the greenway, which might have added value and

5

amenity to -- to her larger store.

6

example, put in landscaping within the greenway that would

7

have made her site more attractive, without violating the

8

restrictions that the City had already placed upon her

9

regarding development of that land.

10

QUESTION:

She could have, for

Doesn't the -- fill me in -- doesn't

11

the public have access to the greenway?

I thought the

12

purpose of the greenway was for a park.

That's not so?

13

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the public does not have

14

access to the lan -- to Mrs. Dolan's land at this time,

15

with the exception of the access for her business.

16

QUESTION:

No, I mean after -- after she

17

complied with the condition for the -- for the permit,

18

would the public have had access to the greenway?

19

MR. SMITH:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, that's -- that's one thing she

21

couldn't -- she could do now and couldn't do afterwards,

22

which is keep other people out.

23

MR. SMITH:

That is absolutely correct.

24

QUESTION:

Which is pretty important.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

QUESTION:

Did the City require an easement or

the fee to this area?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the -- the City in its

4

actual findings required the dedication of a fee.

The

5

City has represented in its brief that what it was really

6

going to ask for was merely an easement.

7

contained in their explicit findings.

8

our reply brief, that even if they were to only require an

9

easement, there would still be an undue burden upon her.

That is not

And as we noted in

10

Because as was noted by Justice Scalia, she would still

11

have the burden of having the public -- the uninvited

12

public, pass to and fro.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

But you say the record as it

14

comes to us shows the requirement of dedication of the fee

15

title to this property?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

The City's findings require dedication.
QUESTION:

All right.

Did the City also require

Mrs. Dolan to construct the bike path at her expense?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the City's findings at

21

the petition for cert at appendix G -- at page G-28,

22

specifically require the construction.

23

has noted and has in fact submitted additional materials

24

to this Court that would show, when Mrs. Dolan made her

25

first application -- and this appeal is brought from a

second application -- that the City had in fact decided

2

not to require her to construct the pathway.

3

However, when the findings came out with regard

4

to the second application, the findings had it back in

5

there again.

6

7
8

So, as the record is before this Court today,
there was a requirement to construct the bike path.
QUESTION:

Well, do you rest your case on the

difference between whether an easement had been given or
10

whether she had to convey the -- didn't -- Nollan involved

11

an easement, as I recall, rather than an outright

12

conveyance, didn't it?

13

MR. SMITH:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Nollan

14

was merely the conveyance of an easement.

15

rest our case on the distinction between dedication of fee

16

and easement.

MR. SMITH:

It's a conveyance of property?
Yes, Your Honor, it is, well

recognized in law.
QUESTION:

Would the case be the same if it had

been a license rather than an easement?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I believe that if the --

24

the requirement had been that that license mandated the

25

continuous passage of the public, it would have been just

as burdensome an imposition upon Mrs. Dolan as was the

2

beach easement was on Mr. and Mrs. --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SMITH:

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

In other words, your answer is yes?
Yes, Your Honor.

I in fact thought that a license to

7

--to use land is the definition of an easement.

8

-- can you create a license to use land that is not an

9

easement?

10

I'm not

Can you?
MR. SMITH:

I believe that Justice Stevens says

11

the answer to that question is yes, and I would defer to

12

his judgment.

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

15

At least it was in my first year

property course, which was some years ago.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. SMITH:

If I could turn again -- once again

18

to the issue of proportionality, I think that one of the

19

important points to be noted in this case is that if there

20

had been a -- a clear understanding on the part of the --

21

of the Oregon Supreme Court and the City of Tigard that

22

there was a requirement for proportionality embedded

23

within this Court's 1987 decision in Nollan v. California

24

Coastal Commission, that the outcome of the case might

25

have been significantly different.

1

This Court, within Nollan, used words like

2

"specific connection," "precise fit" was used in the

3

dissent,

4

construed those to mean that there really only needed to

5

be some sort of rational relationship between the

6

dedications and the adverse impacts.

7

hypothetical impacts -- and I would stress that -- that

8

the impacts that were found by the City in this case were

9

really very, very speculative -- that that was sufficient

"essential nexus."

And the Oregon Supreme Court

And, therefore,

10

to satisfy the City of Tigard, and in fact satisfy the

11

majority of the Oregon Supreme Court.

12

I don't believe that -- that proportionality, as

13

it has been characterized by the City in its brief, is

14

indeed a revolutionary concept.

15

weight of authority across the United States in the

16

various States recognizes that a proportionality test is

17

in fact the one that should be used in looking at the

18

relationship between dedications.

19

QUESTION:

In fact, the emerging

Assuming that there is some degree of

20

proportionality, do you insist on, you know, actual

21

empirical demonstration of adverse effects?

22

MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, we do not.

I

23

believe that would be unreasonable.

And the emerging

24

weight of authority among the States is adopting a similar

25

position there.

As you know, and as is well laid out in the

1

2

Washington Legal Foundation's amicus brief to this Court,

3

they discussed the old Illinois test, which was

4

specifically and uniquely attributable.

5

weight of authority has moved away from that and is

requiring some sort of rough proportionality based on

7

actual impacts, with some sort of temporally present,

articulate the test in simple terms, mostly because the --

proportionality, that there are about three things that

2

need to be done.

3

sort of actual, specific quantification of impacts and of

4

public needs, much as was described in the City of

5

Tigard's record and how their consultant thought that they

6

ought to approach storm water runoff.

7

First of all, there needs to be some

After that quantification is done, I believe

8

that there -- there has to be some sort of proportional

9

relationship that establishes the contribution of an

10

individual development project to the overall need.
And, finally, where a dedication of real

11
12

property is required, I think that needs to be quantified

13

and compared against that -- that fraction or that

14

relationship.

15

QUESTION:

Well, specifically in this case, what

16

should the City of Tigard have done that it didn't do in

order to justify the demands it made on your client for

her property?

19

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, in the -- the

20

first instance, what the City should have done is they

21

should have quantified the actual storm water runoffs that

had -- were going to occur from the 17,600 - square-foot

building.

QUESTION:

that you just aren't quite sure what'll happen, but you

just don't want to take any chances?

15

MR. SMITH:

Justice Stevens, in that instance, I

16

believe that what would occur would not be a dedication of

17

real property as some sort of permit condition, but in

18

fact would be a regulatory restriction upon development as

19

regularly happens within 100-year flood plains, geologic

20

hazard areas.

21

And based on this Court's Lucas decision --

QUESTION:

Well, but you've acknowledged they

could deny the permit outright if they were concerned in

sort of -- they just think there's a danger there, but

24

they're not sure they're able to quantify it.

do that?

MR. SMITH:

You're saying they can't

Your Honor, if the exaggerated

precautions involve the dedication of an interest in real

property, I believe that it is incumbent on the

Government, in order to fulfill this Court's requirements

that

2

relationship test, if we should call it that, as it was

3

applied by the Oregon Supreme Court and was applied by the

4

City of Tigard, is in fact no test at all.

5

fact proportionality is essentially the antithesis of that

test.

7

that the rational basis

And that in

I believe rational -- rational basis is much

more akin to the sort of rational basis review that goes

on in due process and equal protection context, and in

fact is willing to rely upon even the most remote and

11

hypothetical of State interests.
QUESTION:

12

In 1971, the Supreme Court decided

13

that you couldn't make arbitrary distinctions between men

14

and women because that violated the rational basis test.

15

MR. SMITH:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
You said it was no test at all; it

seemed to be a pretty significant test in the case of Reed

MR. SMITH:

I would agree, Your Honor.

And I

20

would believe that within the -- the context of the review

of legislation, that the rational basis review, as it has

been applied by this Court, in fact is -- works quite well

property, that something more than the rational basis

2

review necessarily needs to be applied.

3

QUESTION:

How do you formulate that?

I think

4

it was what Justice O'Connor was asking you earlier.

5

do you formulate the something more?
MR. SMITH:

6

How

Justice Ginsburg, I believe that, as

7

this Court set forth in Nollan, that it said that what was

8

required was a substantial advancement of legitimate State

9

interests; that that substantial advancement test is in

10

fact given context and given substance by virtue of a

11

requirement for proportionality.
QUESTION:

12

That's kind of a submiddle tier,

13

because the stock formula, equal protection/due process,

14

is substantial relationship to an important Government

15

interest.

This is one notch down, a legitimate Government

16

interest.

It's not quite as heavyweight as an important

Government interest, is it?

18

MR. SMITH:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
Mr. Smith, is there any difference,

20

do you think, in the justification the City can offer for

the flood control problem and the justification for the

22

bike path, insofar as Mrs. Dolan's property is concerned?

upon its parent county traffic impact ordinance.

to hit this creek as your denominator, to start with?

3

And then, you, in effect, say that fraction

governs the -- the portion of the cost of improving the

creek that can be borne by this landowner?

6

MR. SMITH:

7

And in fact, with regard to the traffic impact

8

fee that was assessed on Mrs. Dolan, 14,000-and-some-odd

9

dollars, that's exactly what the City did.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

How do you go -- how do you -- how do

11

you determine what your denominator is?

Do you go back to

12

the point where -- before the land was settled, and you

13

figure all of the runoff that is now taking place that

wouldn't have taken place if this were just grassland or

MR. SMITH:

In the City of Tigard, Your Honor,

20

21

comprehensive plan was adopted.

22

evaluated the amount of impervious surface that was within

the Fanno Creek watershed at that time.

looked at the allowable zoning that was provided for

And it then

impervious surface could increase after that, until the

QUESTION:

So, it would be the amount of

That's the storage facility.
QUESTION:

Sure, I think what that means is if

3

the pipe that's going into the municipal conduit that goes

down to this stream would be overloaded, so that there's

5

not -- not enough capacity in that pipe to carry it off,

6

you have to store it and then let it out at another time.

7

But that has nothing to do with -- so long as you can get

8

it into the municipal conduit, you're allowed to do it.

I

don't read this as having anything to do with the capacity

11

of the flood plain.
MR. RAMIS:

The reason that -- that it wouldn't

12

work for an applicant to come in and say, I can get a pipe

13

to the municipal system, is that you wouldn't be able to

14

comply with -- with policy 7.1.2, which says you must

provide adequate public facilities.

16

capacity that's sufficient in that public drainage system

17

when you get to the pipe to it, then you've overloaded it.

And if you've overloaded it, you've caused a harm and you

are required to provide additional capacity.

she had provided a drainage analysis that said we're going

that it is appropriate for a municipality, in deciding

QUESTION:

In Nollan, the Court articulated the question as

And the
Because it

did not serve the same purpose, the Court said it

converted what was a legitimate land use regulation into

As the Court said, again, in -- in Nollan, if it serves a

different purpose, it converts the land use regulation to

QUESTION:

And that's where we think proportionality-

Can -- could I come back to who the

6

burden is on?

You mean that a municipality, all it has to

7

do is say, you know, there may be a thimble full of water,

8

we're not going to do any studies, and therefore, we want

9

0 percent of your land for flood control, and -- and the

10

burden is shifted to Mrs. Dolan to do a study, to show

11

that that is disproportionate?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

No --

Why should the burden be on her?
The City -- the City can't just

that's not at all what happened here.

It's typical for

22

But

Well --

Why isn't the burden on the City to

demonstrate some rough proportionality?
MR. KNEEDLER:

What the City did was to adopt a

24

code of general applicability, which -- which states, for

25

example, that -- that increasing impervious surfaces will

increase runoff and increase flooding, as one example.

2

And then the burden shifts to the landowner to say that

3

this condition will not -- will not further the same

purpose.

QUESTION:

That just shows you're in the same

general ball park, flood control.

But why doesn't the

7

City have -- have the burden of showing that it's roughly

8

proportional?

9

the small individual property owner, to conduct a massive

That's an awful burden to put on the -- on

10

study to demonstrate that the City's wrong.

11

has to say is, well, flood control is flood control.

12

way to do it is to -- is to not expand your property.

13

Another way to do it is to give us 10 percent of your

14

property for --

one of quantification, but logical relatedness of the

condition to the -- to the impact being addressed.

Mr. Smith, you have four minutes remaining.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Will you cover some of the

contentions about the variances and so forth?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

1

On the -- on the matter of a variance, I don't

2

believe that it is appropriate for the City to establish a

3

requirement for the dedication of real property and thrust

4

upon the private property owner the unreasonable demand

5

that in order to escape from having to surrender a fee

6

title or an easement to the Government, it is necessary

7

for them to go through a variance procedure in order to

8

get out from under what would otherwise be an

9

unconstitutional taking of private property.

10

QUESTION:

Well, what about the availability of

11

conditions -- of -- of alternatives that she could have

12

invoked and that the City would have had to accept as a

3
4

matter of right?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I don't believe that

5

there were such alternatives.

6

the record supports that contention.

appendix G of the petition for certiorari, at page G- 2

and G- 4, two recitations that I think belie my

9

distinguished colleague's representation that they do.

20

This -- and I quote here from pages G-ll and

And I don't believe that
And I have noted in

21

G- 2, where the City, in its findings, said, it appears to

22

be impractical to perform the proposed reconstruction of

23

Main Street on a piecemeal fashion, on a lot-by-lot basis.

24

Therefore, we do not propose that any reconstruction of

25

Main Street be required as a condition of approval of this

development proposal.
Similarly, at page G-14, the City says,

3

requiring surface water quality facilities on small sites,

4

which certainly one and two-thirds acres is, could result

5

in numerous facilities that could become a maintenance

6

burden on the City.

7

propose any such facilities, and there are no natural

8

depressions or other areas of this site that are

9

particularly suitable for water -- water quality features.

10

Furthermore, the applicant does not

I think that -- that answers both questions as

11

to whether the City honestly believed that Mrs. Dolan

12

could have avoided the dedications by engaging in either

13

improvements to Main Street or the establishment of an

14

onsite water quality impoundment facility.

15

QUESTION:

Do you agree with your colleague that

16

the Oregon Supreme Court didn't consider the availability

17

of variances, and they were not argued to the Oregon

18

Supreme Court?

19

MR. SMITH:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

I would -- would make one more point about

21

proportionality.

And that is, very essentially, that

22

unless there is some requirement for proportionality

23

between actual impacts and dedications, that even the most

24

strenuous of dedications could have been required.

25

City could have found that Mrs. Dolan's new store would

QUESTION:

And there's no fairness.

And what this Court said in Armstrong

Do the other State plans that you

10

referred to in your main presentation -- New Jersey and

11

elsewhere -- do they provide for some proportionality?

12

MR. SMITH:

13

And, in fact, there is at least one State that I

14

am told -- the State of -- I believe it's Virginia -- that

15

even requires the old Illinois test and requires even a

16

heightened degree of proportionality that puts an extreme

17

burden on Government.

18

Yes, Your Honor, they do.

And it's noteworthy that -- that both the New

19

Jersey and Wisconsin tests were adopted in the 1960's,

20

well before this Court established its ruling in Nollan,

21

and they have worked quite well.
