ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD G. KRISTOL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. KRISTOL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises out of the purchase by a

12

purchase -- the purchase by a pension plan of an insurance

13

policy to provide guaranteed annuities to plan

14

participants and beneficiaries.

15

the contract, the premiums paid are paid into John

16

Hancock's general account and become part of Hancock's

17

general corporate assets.

18

case is whether Hancock's general corporate assets are

19

also to be considered assets of the plan.

Under the provisions of

The fundamental issue in this

20

Hancock unquestionably exercises authority and

21

control over the management of its own corporate assets.

22

If any of those assets are also deemed to be plan assets,

23

then Hancock would be a fiduciary under ERISA and under

24

ERISA's fiduciary rules would be required to manage its

25

corporate assets, or at least a part of them, solely in

1

the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries.

2

Congress specifically addressed contracts issued

3

by insurance companies to pension plans in ERISA section

4

401(b)(2), and that section can be found at page A-94 of

5

the Appendix to the Petition.

6

29 U.S. Code section 1101(b)(2).

7

It is referenced there as

In substance, that section states that in the

8

case of a guaranteed benefit policy issued to a plan, the

9

contract itself is a plan asset, but the insurance

10
11

company's assets are not plan assets.
The Second Circuit concluded in this case, the

12

GAC 50, the contract in issue, is, in part at least, a

13

guaranteed benefit policy within the meaning of section

14

401(b)(2), and that Hancock is not a fiduciary to the

15

extent that guaranteed benefits have already been

16

purchased by the trustee under the contract.

17

went on to hold, however, that Hancock should be

18

considered to be a fiduciary with respect to what the

19

court referred to as the contract's free funds.

That court

MR. KRISTOL:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KRISTOL:

24

Hancock and the Government take the position

25

The contract's what?
Free funds, Your Honor.

Free funds.
Free funds.

that Hancock is not a fiduciary at all with respect to its

1

corporate assets because Harris Trust, as the plan

2

trustee, has at all times had the right under GAC 50 to

3

purchase additional guaranteed benefits to the full extent

4

of the contract's so-called free funds.

5

its entirety, therefore, is a guaranteed benefit policy

6

under section 401(b)(2).
QUESTION:

7

The contract in

Or - - well, that's not quite

8

accurate.

9

accuracy is to the extent the contract provides for

10
11
12

13

Isn't -- what you could say with entire

benefits, it provides for guaranteed benefits.
MR. KRISTOL:

No, I'm not sure I would agree

with that formulation, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

Well, what is in the free fund may

14

not ultimately be used to provide benefits at all, right?

15

It's up to --

16

MR. KRISTOL:

That is correct.

Well, I think

17

that they would ultimately - -

18

QUESTION:

19

providing guaranteed benefits.

20

it's not providing guaranteed benefits it's providing no

21

benefits at all.

22

So, it is not -- it is clearly not

MR. KRISTOL:

But on the other hand, if

No, I don't agree with that,

23

Justice Scalia.

I think that the contract itself, all of

24

the funds held under the contract, whether they stay with

25

John Hancock or are ultimately taken out of the contract

by the plan trustee, would ultimately be used for benefits
for participants and beneficiaries.
QUESTION:

Guaranteed benefits?

MR. KRISTOL:

Not necessarily, no.

This

contract not only provided that the plan could purchase
additional guaranteed benefits to the full extent of the
contract's free funds, but it also provided other
possibilities as well at the option of the plan trustee.
And among those options, of course, was the ability to use
the so-called free funds to purchase or to provide
so-called nonguaranteed benefits.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, if I may, a

complementary question.

Does John Hancock, in issuing

policies to plans like this, ever issue anything that
might be called an insurance contract that does not
provide for some guaranteed benefit?
MR. KRISTOL:

My view of it, Justice Souter,

would be that if it's called an insurance contract, it
would necessarily have guaranteed benefits of some sort.
QUESTION:

At least within the meaning of the

statute, yeah.
MR. KRISTOL:

Within -- well, yes, within the

meaning of the statute.
QUESTION:

Yeah.

If that is the case, then,

then the exception the -- "to the extent" of language,

1

whatever it means, will never have any operative effect,

2

will it?

3

MR. KRISTOL:

4

QUESTION:

No -- no --

Because it will always be tagged

5

onto -- I mean it will always refer to a contract to which

6

the disputed amounts are tagged on to some level of

7

guaranteed benefit.
MR. KRISTOL:

8
9

No, I don't -- I don't think

that's correct, Justice Souter.

I can envisage a contract

10

that would provide in its entirety, as this one does, for

11

guaranteed benefits in the way that I've described it,

12

that also could provide within the same contract that the

13

plan trustee could use the free funds to pay nonguaranteed

14

benefits.

15

any such contract has ever existed, that it would provide

16

for variable benefits.

17

And I could visualize, though I don't believe

QUESTION:

So that would at least distinguish it

18

from the argument that you're making here.

19

point, yeah.

20

MR. KRISTOL:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And how would the statute be

22

construed in the instance that you put where with free

23

funds the insurer may purchase guaranteed benefits or

24

variable benefits?

25

What result under the statute?

MR. KRISTOL:

The result is -7

QUESTION:

Does the exemption apply?

MR. KRISTOL:
same.

The -- well, the result is the

The only thing that Congress required in 401(b)(2)

is that the contract - QUESTION:

Does the insurer have the benefit of

the (2)(b) exemption in the case that I put?
MR. KRISTOL:

The (2)(b) exemption, referring to

401 (2) (b).
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KRISTOL:

I don't -- I don't know that I

would characterize it as an exemption.

But the answer is

that the John Hancock would not be a fiduciary with
respect to any of the assets held under the contract.
QUESTION:

So as long as one of the options is

to purchase guaranteed benefits, that gives the company
the safe harbor that it seeks here.
MR. KRISTOL:
term, that's correct.

If -- yes, if you want to use that
So long as the contract provides

for guaranteed benefits either immediately or at some time
in the future at the option of the plan trustee, then the
contract in its entirety is a guaranteed benefit policy
even though the contract might also provide options to the
plan trustee to use the so-called free funds to provide
nonguaranteed benefits.
And also in the example that Justice Souter

1

asked me about, suppose there was a contract that also

2

said the trustee could use these funds to provide variable

3

annuities.

4

QUESTION:

Well, then all an insurance company

5

needs to do to get the safe harbor, if we can call it

6

that, is to just include guaranteed benefits as one of the

7

options and it's home free.

8

MR. KRISTOL:

Well, the insurance company, of

course, is entering into a contract with a fiduciary, the
10

plan trustee.

11

guaranteed benefits to the full extent of the book value

12

of the contract, yes, that contract is a guaranteed

13

benefit policy irrespective of the other options.

14

And the contract, if it provides for

QUESTION:

As a practical matter -- I think you

15

may already have answered this for me, Mr. Kristol, but as

16

a practical matter do you know of any instances in which

17

your company, at least, has issued a policy in these

18

circumstances without providing for some guaranteed

1

benefit option for the use of the free funds?

20

MR. KRISTOL:

To the extent that I'm familiar

21

with insurance contracts, meaning contracts that provide

22

for guaranteed benefits, the answer, of course, is they

23

provide somewhere - -

24

QUESTION:

By definition, you're saying, yeah.

25

MR. KRISTOL:

-- Somewhere.

But

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)28 -2260
(800) FOR DEPO

I assume that

there are contracts that are issued that don't provide for
any guaranteed benefits.
QUESTION:

But if we are going to -- if we're

going to follow the definition of insurance contract as
you're using it and as we all assume the statute is using
it, then -- well, no, maybe I misunderstood your answer.
Is it necessarily the case that there could be
an insurance contract -- I'm sorry, I'm saying this badly.
Couldn't you have an insurance contract that simply made
no provision for the purchase of any guaranteed benefit or
additional guaranteed benefit with the free funds?
That's -- that would be an insurance contract within the
meaning of the statute, wouldn't it?
MR. KRISTOL:

If the free funds portion was not

available to use - - to be used for additional guaranteed
benefits, which is the situation you're positing.
QUESTION:

Yeah, yeah.

MR. KRISTOL:

I would think that to that extent

the contract - - to that extent - - the contract provides
guaranteed benefits to the extent of the guaranteed
benefits that have been purchased.

Because, by

definition, the balance of the funds under the contract
are not available for that purpose.

I should like to add,

though, I don't think any such contract exists.
QUESTION:

Okay.

3

QUESTION:

What is the converse of a guaranteed

benefit policy?
MR. KRISTOL:

I think for all practical

4

purposes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a separate account

5

contract, a variable annuity contract.

6

that the definition which is a functional description of a

7

general account contract deals with the -- one half of the

8

universe of the contracts issued by insurance companies.

9

They're either general account contracts and they provide

That is, I believe

10

guaranteed benefits, not necessarily in their entirety but

11

typically, and the other hand variable annuity contracts.

12

QUESTION:

Does that mean -- when you say a

13

guaranteed benefit, that doesn't necessarily mean a fixed

14

amount, does it?

15

MR. KRISTOL:

It means, in the pension context,

16

that the benefits payable to plan participants are fixed

17

in amount by the plan.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. KRISTOL:

20
21
22

23

Fixed at a dollar amount.
Fixed at a monthly dollar amount

typically, that's correct.
QUESTION:

It - -

And then the other half of the world

is variable?
MR. KRISTOL:

The other half of the world would

24

be separate account contracts, some of which provide for

25

variable annuities, and then there's a whole variety of

1

other kinds of separate account products.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Kristol, there's reference in the

3

briefs to the period between '77 and '82 and what is the

4

nature of the benefits paid between those years?

5

they, in fact, nonguaranteed, or were they fixed?

6

were they?

7

10

MR. KRISTOL:

Were
What

They were fixed but nonguaranteed,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No question in your mind about that.

MR. KRISTOL:

That's correct.

The plan

11

provided, as I understand it, only for fixed benefits.

12

And then under this contract, to the extent that the plan

13

trustee purchased guaranteed benefits under the contract,

14

then the monthly benefits to those retirees were

15

guaranteed by the general account of John Hancock.

16

As to any other retirees, for example those that

17

the plan trustee might decide that they wanted to pay the

18

monthly benefit using money available to the plan, there

19

was the -- this 1977 amendment which permitted the plan

20

trustee to use funds held by John Hancock in this contract

21

to pay those monthly benefits, but the benefits were never

22

guaranteed by John Hancock.

23

paid they were paid.

25

QUESTION:

Of course, when they were

But there's also comment to the

effect that the decision below would wreak havoc.

The

1

Seventh Circuit adopted the Second Circuit's rule a decade

2

ago.

3

on the insurance industry in the Midwest?

Is there anything that that case has wreaked havoc

4

MR. KRISTOL:

No, Your Honor, it has not.

And I

5

think that's largely because that decision -- in that

6

decision the Seventh Circuit itself quizzed -- questioned

7

the correctness of the decision on the motion for

8

reconsideration.

9

the district court, and I think what the Seventh Circuit

10

did was decide that a claim under ERISA had been stated,

11

and I think they even doubted that by the time they ruled

12

on the motion for reconsideration.

13

It was decided on a motion to dismiss in

QUESTION:

Do we have any followup to that

14

Peoria case?

15

when it went back to the district court, is there any

16

followup?

17

It was -- the 12(3) (6) was overturned and

MR. KRISTOL:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't know

18

what the followup is.

19

and I, frankly, don't know what happened to the case.

20

There's no other reported decision

QUESTION: Do I understand your position to be

21

that this statute that Congress passed, that the meaning

22

of it is essentially the same as if the Senate bill, which

23

was very clear, had passed, that there's practically no

24

difference?

MR. KRISTOL:

I think, for all practical

1

purposes, that's correct, it would not have any

2

difference.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Kristol, could I followup on the

4

various hypotheticals that you - - do I understand you to

5

say that if there were guaranteed benefits and the free

6

funds were to be used exclusively to provide contingent

7

benefits -- that is benefits the amount of which or even

8

the existence of which would depend upon whether the free

9

funds were available or not, you would still call that a

10

guaranteed benefit plan?
MR. KRISTOL:

11

Justice Scalia, I'm not sure I

12

quite understand the example, but I think I can say

13

plainly what I mean in relation to the statute, that if

14

the contract provides that the entire book value of the

15

contract can be applied by the plan trustee to provide

16

guaranteed benefits which would be fixed guaranteed

17

benefits, the contract in its entirety is a guaranteed

18

benefit policy within the meaning of this section of

19

ERISA.

20

QUESTION:

Now, take my hypothetical.

There are

21

guaranteed benefits which the insurer -- the insurer

22

guarantees, fixed amount of benefits.

23

however, if the plan generates more money, that is if the

24

free funds are available for the purpose after paying off

25

the guaranteed benefits, there will be additional benefits

In addition,

paid, but those benefits are contingent upon the free

2

funds being available.

MR. KRISTOL:

of.

That isn't a construct I'm aware

I'm having trouble, Your Honor -QUESTION:

5

Well, I know, I just made it up.

I

6

just want you to tell me whether you think that is a

guaranteed benefit plan or not?

theory, it is.

guaranteed, it doesn't matter what the rest of the money

You're saying so long as some benefits are

is being used for, even if they're being used for

11

contingent benefits.
MR. KRISTOL:

impression.

14
15

I hope I didn't leave that

QUESTION:

Well, that's how -- that's where you

left me.

16

MR. KRISTOL:

If the plan trustee has a right to

17

provide additional guaranteed benefits, in our view the

18

contract in its entirety is a guaranteed benefit.

QUESTION:

Please

take my hypothetical.

You made reference to a guaranteed

The plan in this case provided for fixed benefits.

That's right.

says, yes, for this amount of money we will provide those

fixed benefits.

4

our investments turn out to be very good and there's --

5

and there are sufficient funds in the free fund to cover

it, we will pay additional benefits.

In addition, if there's -- you know, if

MR. KRISTOL:

7

Yes, that -- that is a description

of GAC 50.

As the free funds under the contract grew, the

9

plan trustee, of course, had more funds available to pay

10

his nonguaranteed benefits.

12

QUESTION:

That doesn't change the

Well, I thought -- but doesn't -- it

13

depends on the option being in the hands of the plan

14

trustee and not the insurance company, doesn't it?

15
16
17

MR. KRISTOL:

The option would always be in the

hands of the trustee, if there's an option.
QUESTION:

But if there were no -- if there were

18

a case in which the only option for the use of the free

19

funds, written right into the contract, was to provide

20

variable annuities, then it would take it out of your --

21

the rule that you're urging us to adopt here?

22

MR. KRISTOL:

No.

That's a difficult question,

23

but the answer is no.

So long as the free funds can be

24

used to purchase guaranteed benefits, then it is a

25

guaranteed benefit in its entirety within the meaning of

the statute.
QUESTION:

2

No, I'm sorry, I just didn't state my

3

point clearly enough.

If the -- if the provision were

4

that free funds may be used only for the purpose of

5

purchasing variable annuities, then you would be outside

6

the rule that you're urging us to adopt here?

7

MR. KRISTOL:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KRISTOL:

That is correct.

Okay.
And if the contract in part

10

provided for the use - - for that purpose and some portion

11

of the free funds could not be used for guaranteed

12

benefits under this contract, then to the extent that

13

language would come into play.

14

QUESTION:

Then different result.

15

QUESTION:

I understand your brief to represent

16

that for variable benefits under State insurance laws in

17

all the States you can't use general account contracts?

18

MR. KRISTOL:

19

QUESTION:

20

Nothing.

No.

What can we do

Until 1988 when the nonguaranteed

10

portion had risen from $18 million to in excess of $55

11

million, the plan was frustrated in its ability to use

12

those excess funds.
In 1988, Hancock finally agreed to a plan

13
14

amendment which allowed us to withdraw almost $55 million

15

of free funds --a term coined by Hancock, not the trust.

16

Under that amendment we could withdraw it without

17

suffering the penalty of contract termination and the

18

repurchase of annuities and, in effect, convert the

19

contract into a deferred annuity contract.
Now, the question as to whether the $55 million,

20
21

when in the possession of Hancock, was not free funds but

22

the moment it was transferred it became free funds.

Hancock's position in this case is a resurrection of the

But the problem had reached the point of the

continued growth of free funds that Hancock in 1977 agreed

that the free funds now can be used to pay nonguaranteed

It ignored the words "to the extent."
Well, the words "to the extent" are used not

10

only in the statute, they're used in the conference report

where the conference committee was describing the amount
