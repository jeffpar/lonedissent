ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTS:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; may

it please the Court:
This case is here from the United States Court

10
11

of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

12

petitioner Digital Equipment must await the end of trial

13

before appealing the district court's denial of its claim

14

that it had the right to avoid trial altogether pursuant

15

to its settlement agreement with respondent Desktop

16

Direct.

17

That court held that

The district court had rescinded that settlement

18

agreement and vacated Desktop Direct's dismissal after

19

finding that a factfinder could conclude that Digital

20

failed to disclose facts to Desktop that would cause

21

Desktop not to accept the settlement offer.

22

The Tenth Circuit refused to hear Digital's

23

appeal from that ruling under the collateral order

24

doctrine because it determined that the issue of the

25

enforceability of settlement agreements was not "important

enough" to justify appeal.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Roberts, the district court order

3

seemed to indicate that the district court thought there

4

was a factfinding determination necessary on whether the

5

settlement agreement should be set aside.
MR. ROBERTS:

6

The district court order stated

7

that he was granting the motion because a factfinder could

8

determine that Digital failed to disclose facts.
QUESTION:

And the appeal taken was on the

10

theory that no factfinding could be allowed on that

11

question?
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, there are a number of

13

grounds for appeal, the first being that that is the wrong

14

standard.

15

the dismissal with prejudice because a factfinder could

16

determine.

17

very least, a factfinder should find fraud, and we think

18

must find fraud under clear and convincing evidence.

1

was not done here, but there is a final decision on the

20

validity of the settlement agreement.

21

agreement has been thrown out.

22

was granted, and as the Tenth Circuit found, that's all

23

the district court is going to do on that issue.

24
25

He threw out the settlement agreement, vacated

That's plainly the wrong standard.

1

Digital Corporation did know of the Desktop name, could

2

the ruling in those findings then be the subject of a

3

separate appeal?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor, because the issue

5

on appeal is the validity of the settlement agreement.

6

That is what gives us our right to avoid trial.

7

QUESTION:

But that's not separable from the

8

merits, that's right at the heart of the merits -- what

9

the Digital Corporation knew and when they knew it.
MR. ROBERTS:

10

No.

The Tenth Circuit found that

11

the issue on appeal was separable from the merits and it

12

was correct, for this reason:

13

validity of their claim that we violated their trademark

14

rights.

15

settlement discussions took place.

16

that all they needed to know was there at that point.

17

the merits concern the

They filed that complaint, of course, before any
They presumably felt

Now, the issue of the validity of the settlement

18

agreement raises entirely different questions about what

19

was said during negotiations, what was not said.

20

QUESTION:

Well, suppose there were a finding

21

that Digital knew at the time the agreement was negotiated

22

and beforehand, and before it began using the Desktop

23

name, that Desktop had a trademark interest in it.

24

seems to me that that is highly relevant to the

25

substantive litigation.

It

MR. ROBERTS:

1

I think the most that can be said

2

is that their allegations with respect to the settlement

3

may be relevant on damages.

4

they allege at this point, but even there, it is, as the

5

court has said in Mitchell v. Forsyth, conceptually

6

distinct.

7

That's the only thing that

In Mitchell v. Forsyth, of course, there was

8

complete overlap on the facts.

9

immunity, and you needed to know what the allegations were

10

before you could judge that, but the court said because in

11

Mitchell you take as true the allegations and ask if that

12

violated a substantive legal standard, that was

13

conceptually distinct from whether or not the allegations

14

were true.

15

The question was qualified

Same thing here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, let me ask you a

16

question about those first two criteria.

17

present an agreement between the parties that meet the

18

first two requirements, but this is a jurisdictional

19

question, is it not?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

21

QUESTION:

You seem to

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

So if we don't think that you did

22

meet those requirements, it doesn't matter that you and

23

your adversary agree that you did.

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

QUESTION:

Correct.

to you this way:

back to the lower court and saying, the district judge

5

said only a trier could find -- a trier could find the

the settlement will indeed stick.

has found fraud.

whether on damages or some other issue, that there was no

fraud.

18

he vacated the settlement agreement without making any

19

findings with respect to fraud at all, so yes, we are

20

foreclosed from arguing the validity of the settlement

21

agreement, but not from arguing that there was no fraud.

22

That has been

We are not foreclosed from arguing

The error in the district court's ruling is that

Mr. Roberts, may we take the case a

the settlement agreement was indeed valid from the

beginning.

4

they had breached the settlement agreement, and you would

be entitled to damages for all that happened in the

interim?

It therefore would follow, would it not, that

I'm not sure, Your Honor, for this

reason.

I don't know that there's a cause of action under

MR. ROBERTS:

For breach of contract?
Well, there is a cause of action

for breach of contract, but I'm not sure that --

QUESTION:

It's strange to say that Utah doesn't

litigation.

That contract --

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Under the settlement agreement --

Yes ---by its plain terms.

-- and if that right has been

21

breached, isn't compensation for that right adequate to

redress any injury you have?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

The breach would come from the

24

filing and pursuit of the lawsuit.

25

that, the Federal court had said the contract is invalid.

At the time they did

1

2

You have the right to go ahead and sue.
I don't think you can maintain an action for

3

breach of contract after the contract had been thrown out,

4

and that's one of the reasons that we are irreparably

5

harmed by forcing us to go to trial, to wait until the end

6

of trial to pursue our appeal.

7

In addition to the fact that any of the damages

8

that would flow from that would certainly not be

9

calculable, the damages to our commercial program, our

10

venture, the losses we sustained there, are not

11

sufficiently calculable to be recoverable even if there

12

could be a breach of contract action.

13

QUESTION:

I suppose, Mr. Roberts, that your

14

right not to be sued was a right not to be sued on the

15

underlying cause of action --

16

MR. ROBERTS:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's correct.

-- not a right not to be sued for

rescission of what is claimed to be an invalid agreement.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

20

QUESTION:

Well, that's right, and as I --

Indeed, such an agreement not to sue

21

you for fraud or for any other invalidity of an agreement

22

is probably void as contrary to public policy, I would

23

think, wouldn't it be?

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

Well, those are the hurdles to our

recovery of any damages, that it is not a breach to

rescind the contract, and once the contract is rescinded,

2

you can't argue breach because there's no contract to

MR. ROBERTS:

10

QUESTION:

It is --

Mr. Roberts, may I ask you just a

11

narrow question?

12

fraud claimed as a basis for the rescission as well as the

13

damages claimed in the action on the merits?

14

18

Is wilfulness an element both of the

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, wilfulness I guess is an

element of the fraud claim, but the damages claim - QUESTION:

So isn't that the end of the issue,

so far as the second element under Cohen is concerned?
MR. ROBERTS:

Not at all.

We have a much

stronger case on separability than the other cases in

20

which this Court has found Cohen applicable.

22

QUESTION:

The Double

Well, I think your -- I don't want to

23

be too picky, but I think you're saying, yes, on the face

24

of it there is not a complete distinction between the

25

issue upon which the rescission turns and the underlying

1

cause of action, but you are now saying that this Court

2

really has not insisted on that degree of separability, is

3

that fair to say?

Is that your argument?

MR. ROBERTS:

4

I think not, Your Honor, in this

5

sense.

I do think there is a complete separation between

6

the issues because the question of factual overlap is not

7

the test to determine if the issues are separate or not.
In Mitchell, the question was qualified

8

9

immunity.
QUESTION:

10
11

In other words, a common element is

not sufficient to defeat separability.
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Absolutely not.

It is not

13

sufficient.

14

have been appealable, because obviously there's a common

15

element there, and the Double Jeopardy cases would not be

16

appealable, because there are common elements here.

17

If it were, the claim in Mitchell would not

QUESTION:

How about claim preclusion?

You

18

mention Double Jeopardy on the criminal side, but isn't

19

the closest analogy, since you have a civil case here,

20

claim preclusion, and it was not my understanding that if

21

you unsuccessfully plead claim preclusion that you have,

22

under Cohen v. Beneficial, a right to immediately appeal

23

the adverse ruling.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:
either.

It's not our understanding,

We don't think you do, and the reason is that the

1

claim preclusion test, it fails the second element of the

2

Cohen test.

3

There is overlap there.

There's not here, because on appeal our argument

4

will be 1) the district court applied the wrong standard.

5

Could someone find fraud is not a sufficient basis for

6

vacating the settlement agreement, 2) even if, looking at

7

the merits, there is no duty on our part to disclose

8

material facts to our adversary during settlement

9

negotiations.

10

That's conceptually distinct, as Mitchell

put it, from the merit of the allegations.
QUESTION:

11

But isn't claim preclusion a right

12

not to be sued on this claim, and isn't that the heart of

13

your argument, that you have a right not to be sued, and

14

that that's what claim preclusion is on the civil side?

15

It is the analogue to Double Jeopardy on the criminal

16

side, only there is no Cohen v. Beneficial right?

17

MR. ROBERTS:

Our claim is that we have the

18

right not to be sued.

That's set forth expressly in the

19

settlement agreement.

That may well be the same argument

20

in the claim preclusion cases, but in the claim preclusion

21

cases there is -- the issues are not separate.

22

they are.

23

QUESTION:

Why aren't they?

In ours,

There's factual

24

overlap, perhaps, but the issue is whether a court found —

25

against you.

It's a simple, factual issue of whether a

2

rightly or wrongly doesn't matter.

3

seems to me.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5

allegations and perhaps even --

6

9

QUESTION:

Whether

That's no overlap, it

You need to examine the factual

You've just told us that common facts

don't make the difference.
MR. ROBERTS:

In the claim preclusion case, it

is different because you need to examine it and perhaps

10

even wait until you've determined exactly what the facts

11

are to see exactly, precisely what the claim is or what

12

the issue is that's allegedly precluded.

13

It's very different in our situation, where we

14

are talking about a legal standard, a legal issue on

15

appeal, as opposed to the merits of the factual

16

allegations, and in fact as in Mitchell, our argument on

17

the standard even accepts as true the factual allegations

18

and says, even if that's true, do we have a duty during

19

settlement negotiations to disclose facts to our

20

adversary, and the answer we will argue, if we're afforded

21

the opportunity on appeal, is no.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

What about a right not to be sued

because of a statute of limitations bar?
MR. ROBERTS:

The statute of limitations does

not confer a right to avoid trial.

It is much more like

It is the delay between the event and the trial that is

the harm, and the holding of a trial does not increase

that delay.

No, but once the delay has occurred,

MR. ROBERTS:

out -- in the Van Cauwenberghe case it said the critical

QUESTION:

There's a certain amount of word play

there, though, you know, and in the court's opinions it

some of which have gone one way and some the other.

It is not easy, and there is word

play, but the manner in which word play must be avoided is

to make every claim a right not to be tried.

You didn't try as an alternate -- not the

therefore it's not at all inexplicable, as our friends on

4

the other side point out, why we went this way.

5

Second of all, it's not even clear that we would

6

have a right under 1292(b).

It is available only under

7

certain limited circumstances, and it's certainly not

8

clear that the district court would think that those

9

circumstances were met here.

It's doubly discretionary.

10

You need the discretion of the district court and the

11

court of appeals before you pursue that route.

12

And finally, some courts have taken the position

13

of holding it against a party if they assert an

14

alternative basis, as you've suggested.

15

where a court says, you must not have much confidence in

16

your 1291 position, because you went ahead and sought

17

certification under 1292(b).

18

There are cases

When we filed this appeal, the law was, to the

19

extent it had been decided, every circuit in published

20

opinions said we had a right under 1291, and that's the

21

route that we took.

Justice Scalia mentioned earlier that the issue

QUESTION:

A firm final judgment rule is also

9

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, there are policies of

judicial economy and efficiency that support the final

judgment.

We think that we promote those policies in this

12

situation.

When you have a settlement between the parties

that resolves the merits and precludes litigation, it is

in the interest of judicial efficiency and economy to make

15

sure that that really does not do what it says before

whole, the costs and burdens and expense of trial.

It's an interpretation of final to

final judgments, but final decisions, as the statute

specifies.

QUESTION:

One narrowly final decision means

that the district court has disassociated itself from the

That is the ordinary meaning of it.

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

The meaning in

In the general case you will

there is nothing further for the district court to do.

yourself at the mercy of the district courts to say it is

Because the collateral order rule is an

1

2

exception, and it is, the Court has said that many times,

3

to this clear congressional directive which on its face

4

recognizes no exceptions, this Court has very carefully

5

and consistently clarified that as an exception it is to

be narrowly construed, and it applies only to a small

7

class of cases.
QUESTION:

8

Well, if you're going to say it's an

exception, you're saying, then, that final judgment and
10

final decision are identical terms.
MR. LEE:

That is correct, and the Court has so

Two preliminary observations with regard to

The first is that they are separate

in the sense that if the Court agrees with us on any one

of the three, then we win the case, but there are

11

interrelationships and overlaps among the three.

12

With regard to the Midland Asphalt requirement,

13

the petitioner's whole case rests on its contention that

14

it has been deprived of a right not to go to trial, but

15

there has been no such deprivation, as that right has been

16

defined by this Court.

17

Midland Asphalt states unequivocally that a

18

right not to be tried in the sense relevant to Cohen rests

19

upon an explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee

20

that trial will not occur.

21

The petitioner's claim here finds its source

neither in the Constitution nor in statutory law, so that

faced with this dilemma, the petitioner takes the only

position that it possibly can take, which is that the

In our view,

that in order to qualify as a right not to go to trial, it

21

has to rise to a certain dignity, and that dignity is

22

emphasized, or that dignity is, according to the Court's

23

unanimous opinion in Midland, which was repeated just 2

24

months later in Lauro Lines, something that rises to the

25

level of a statute or the Constitution.

QUESTION:

1

There is an important distinction,

2

Justice Stevens, in answer to your question about breach

3

of contract, between constitutional rights and statutory

4

rights on the one hand not to go to trial, and those that

5

derive from breach of contract.
Typically, in order to vindicate statutorily

6

7

created or constitutionally created rights not to go to

8

trial, the only way that can be done is to stop the trial,

9

whereas in the case of a private contract, there is an

10

additional remedy, and it's the same remedy that is

11

available in any contract case, and that is damages for

12

breach of contract which can be reviewed after the case

13

finally goes to final judgment, as 1291 says that it

14

should.

15

We fully recognize that, and I expect fully to

16

hear those words played back to me at a later point in

17

time in a Utah court -- in the Utah district court, but

18

that's our position on this point of law.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, would you explain your

20

position on the first two Cohen standards?

21

you agree with Mr. Roberts that those two standards are

22

met, and I was -- I didn't understand why you agreed --

that?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

Either way, I think this case is

10

not appealable, but the way I have worked that one out for

11

myself, Justice Ginsburg, is the following.

12

The Tenth Circuit is absolutely right that the

13

district court's opinion on this matter is somewhat

14

cryptic, but the Tenth Circuit went on to conclude, and I

15

think absolutely correctly, that the court nevertheless

16

did find fraud, because in the Tenth Circuit's language,

17

it rescinded the agreement, and I think that for purposes

18

of this Court's work, which has to decide the important

19

legal issues in this case, the most efficient thing for

20

you to do is to simply accept the district court's --

21

excuse me, the court of appeals characterization as to

22

what the district court really did, but in either event,

23

that issue should not be appealable.

24

second?

2

MR. LEE:

3

QUESTION:

Sure.
Do you agree with Mr. Roberts that

4

wilfulness is a common element both of the fraud claim on

5

which the rescission is based as well as the cause of

6

action?

7

MR. LEE:

I surely do not, Justice Souter, and I

8

have to confess that that separability argument did not

9

make it into the final draft of this brief as a fourth

10

argument, but I will say that I think it would be a

11

perfectly legitimate ground, alternative ground, on which

12

the Court could affirm the Tenth Circuit.

13

The only reason it isn't in here is because of

14

the tactical judgment that the other three arguments were

15

so strong that we wanted to include those and those only.

16

Turning to the importance issue, I just want to

17

make this very, very clear.

18

it is the issue in this case, and it overlaps both of the

19

other two.

20

I agree with Justice Scalia,

Now, whether -- whether the Cohen exception is

21

an interpretation of the word final, as the Court has said

22

on a few occasions, or whether it is an exception to

23

section 1291, as the Court has said on many more

24

occasions, that importance language is not something that

25

the Court has read into 1291.

does not appear in the language of 1291, but where it does

appear is in the Cohen opinion, and has been repeated 15

times over the intervening period from 1949 to 1994, and

as a consequence, it is one of the mainstays.

of the requirements.

It is one

Now, Mr. Roberts is absolutely right that it has

8

never been the deciding factor.

That is, it has never

9

been the sole deciding factor, but two facts in that

10

respect:

11

and the second is, I suspect -- well, I won't suspect

12

anything.

13

the one is that it has been repeated 16 times,

Justice Scalia reminded us in his separate

14

concurrence in Lauro Lines that it's not something to be

15

forgotten, and while Mr. Roberts has pointed out quite

16

correctly that that was only a concurrence, no member of

17

the majority objected to it, and even more

18

significantly --

19
20

QUESTION:

Is that the test of the validity of a

concurrence, that no member of the majority objects to it?
MR. LEE:

21

Even more significant is the fact that

22

it was cited with approval by the majority in the Court's

23

most recent opinion, which is Puerto Rico Sewer &

you say it is ultimately capable of being reviewed, you

13

could concede the importance of this and still say that

it's not being denied review altogether.

MR. LEE:

Yes, but I think the clear thrust of

all of those --of Cohen, taken together with all of the

other subsequent cases that have interpreted this

ones that have come down in about the past 5 years, I

certainly would not be as presumptuous as to tell this

that as I read them, importance is still there.

MR. LEE:

Briefly, the petitioner's contention that his

It's a pretty good line.

The importance of being important.
That's right.

claim satisfies the importance requirement because of the

10

need to honor settlement agreements is completely beside

11

the point.
We agree that settlement agreements are in the

12

13

public interest, but no one has ever suggested that fraud

14

is in the public interest, and once again I will simply

15

refer back to what I said earlier, Justice Ginsburg, that

16

though there is some dispute as to what the district court

17

found, I think the most efficient thing to do is simply to

18

adopt what the court of appeals said in that respect.

19

But even if you assume, for purposes of

20

argument, that the district court did not find fraud, and

21

that the review the petitioner seeks here is a review of

22

the standard by which the court determined that rescission

23

was proper, that legal issue involves nothing more than

24

Utah State law dealing with matters of contract and

evidence.

interlocutory appeal, if the importance requirement means

2

anything at all.

3

Now, finally, even if the Court were now to

4

conclude that it did not know what it was talking about

5

when it drew a distinction between public and private

6

rights in Midland Asphalt, and even if the importance

7

requirement is now to be eliminated because we now know

8

what we have not known for 45 years -- that it involves

9

inquiries inappropriate for courts -- piecemeal appeal

10

would still be inappropriate in this case, and the reason

11

is that the petitioner's claim is effectively reviewable

12

after trial, because the essence of the petitioner's

13

claimed right need not be characterized, and therefore

14

under this Court's decisions in Van Cauwenberghe and

15

Midland Asphalt should not be characterized as involving a

16

right not to go to trial.

17

The petitioner's entire case depends on this

18

Court's acceptance of its premise that the essence of the

19

right it claims is the right not to stand trial, but the

20

premise itself fails.

21

right not to go to trial in the sense relevant to Cohen

22

must be rooted in the Constitution or in statutory law.

trial.
The Court pointed out in Van Cauwenberghe that

2

3

in some sense any litigant who has a meritorious pretrial

4

basis for dismissal has a right not to go to trial, and

5

that is true across a broad range of possible defenses.

6

If the case is dismissed on statute of limitations grounds

7

or on personal jurisdictional grounds, there will be no

8

trial, and it was for this reason that the Court cautioned

9

in Midland Asphalt that we must not play word games in

10

this area with what is really the essence of the right not

11

to go to trial.
We submit that -- oh, we submit that where you

12

13

have an option between two characterizations, two

14

interpretations, one of which will increase the number of

15

interlocutory appeals contrary to the plain language of

16

section 1291, and the other of which will control the

17

number of those interlocutory appeals, that under Van

18

Cauwenberghe and Midland the better approach clearly is to

limit rather than to increase -QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts says there's nothing else

There's nothing else on the 60(b) list, I take it nothing

list, but I really see no difference between this and the

2

statute of limitations.

3

because the statute of limitations is run, there's going

4

to be no trial, and similarly, as in Van Cauwenberghe, if

5

service of personal jurisdiction is improper, there's

6

going to be no trial.

7

If I have my case dismissed

Moreover, and this is an even more important

8

point, when you have these two alternative

9

interpretations, which one of them do you pick.

As a

10

matter of acceptable usage of the English language, this

11

agreement could be interpreted, just as Mr. Roberts

12

interprets it, as conferring a right not to go forward

13

with the trial.

14

But there are three other options that are

15

equally acceptable as a matter of appropriate English

16

language, one is that what they really wanted was a bottom

17

line decision as to how much money they were going to have

18

to pay.

19

Second is that they wanted the lawsuit settled, and behind

20

them, and the third is, they wanted the use of the

21

trademark.

22

They wanted a limitation on their damages.

Now, when you have that kind of a choice between

23

picking -- between characterizations that will increase

24

interlocutory appeals and those that will control them,

25

Van Cauwenberghe very clearly said which of those choices

1

2

we should make, and that language is as follows:
Because of the important interests furthered by

3

the final judgment rule, and the ease -- the ease with

4

which certain pretrial claims for dismissal may be alleged

5

to entail the right not to stand trial, we should examine

6

the nature of the right asserted with special care.

7

Now, if you apply that special care test to the

8

facts of this case, I submit common sense tells you that

9

the essence of this claim, even without the Van

10

Cauwenberghe tilt, tells you that the essence of the claim

11

was not the right not to stand trial.

12

We're dealing here with a huge corporation, and

13

their lawyers and their employees are in court every day.

14

It just defies common sense that what they really wanted

15

was to avoid one more courtroom in the district of Utah.

16

I submit that what common sense tells us is that

17

what they really wanted was the bottom line determination

18

as to how much money they were going to own - - they were

19

going to owe, get the obligation of the lawsuit out of the

20

way, and acquire the right to the trademark.

21

The petitioner's policy argument that we need to

22

be concerned about crowding the district court documents,

23

or dockets, fails for several reasons.

24

important, policy arguments about how the crowded district

for you on the basis of that argument, all we really will

You may want to write it on a brighter ground, or

proves too much.

1

I'll show in just a moment, that the real problem with

2

congestion in our courts is in the district courts rather

3

than in the appellate courts, then what we ought to do is

4

repeal section 1291 altogether, and that judgment, again,

5

ought to be made by Congress.

6

Finally, the argument is factually flawed.

As

7

set forth in our brief, the conclusion -- the focus of the

8

Federal Court Study Committee when it did its work was on

9

the congestion -- was on the problem of congestion in the

10

appellate courts rather than in the district courts, and

11

in any event, to whatever extent those things need to be

12

balanced, it should be done by Congress.

13

QUESTION:

If the district court found the court

14

didn't fraud didn't infect the settlement, that would be

15

the end of it.

16

if the district court finds --

17

The settlement would hold.

So it's only

You said that you didn't make the separateness

18

argument because you thought your other arguments were

19

stronger, but that is an argument that this Court could

20

look into because this is a jurisdictional question.

21

MR. LEE:

22

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
So what -- Mr. Roberts insists that

23

the merits are not bound up with this question, and can

24

you tell us as concisely as you can why you think that

this appeal fails the separateness test as well?

MR. LEE:

1

Well, they both involve fraud, both

2

the claim on the merits and also the setting aside of the

3

settlement agreement, and many of those fraudulent issues

4

will be the same.

5

I say, it was solely a tactical judgment, and I would be

delighted if you overruled my tactical judgment and ruled

7

in our favor on that ground.
With regard, very briefly, to the -- the

There is not a complete overlap, and as

petitioner completely misunderstands our argument with

10

respect to 1292(b).

Whether they did or did not avail

11

themselves of 1292(b) is in our view irrelevant.

12

doesn't matter at all to the outcome of this case.

That

The only thing we are saying is that, as the

13
14

Chief Justice mentioned a moment ago, the Court has said

15

that this is, whether you call it an interpretation of the

16

word final, or an exception to the Cohen rule of law, has

17

made very clear it is to be very narrowly construed.
On occasion it has used the term, utmost

18
19

strictness, and our only point with respect to 1292(b) is

20

that that is another reason to continue with that strict

21

approach, because in the event you do have some truly

22

meritorious cases that really do need to be appealed by

23

breaking up the trial right in the middle of it, the

24

safety valve, there is another safety valve applicable to

25

1292(b).

All

it says is that the momentum that I see building in recent

3

years toward a narrow construction of the Cohen rule

should continue.
One final observation.

5

As I count them up, in

6

any collateral order case, any one, there are at least

7

four requirements which this Court --by which this Court

8

has controlled access to interlocutory appeal.

9

the three that are stated by Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay,

They are

10

except that the second one, Justice Ginsburg, is really

11

12

have those four.

It's the separateness, and importance, so you really

13

But in a case involving an asserted right to

14

avoid trial, you have two more, because of the Midland

15

Asphalt rule and because of this characterization problem

16

that we've been talking about.

17

hurdles that you have to get over, six controls -- six

18

control points by which this Court can limit the number of

19

interlocutory appeals.

So at a maximum, six

20

The only way that the petitioner can win this

21

case is for the Court to say that three of those six no

22

longer count, and I submit that to do so would be squarely

23

inconsistent with what this Court cautioned in Firestone
