ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSON:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
We ask the Court today to reverse the judgment

11

of the Tennessee supreme court vacating the sentence of

12

death imposed by a jury on Donald Middlebrooks.

13

The Tennessee death penalty system achieves the

14

goal of rational and principled sentencing in which only

15

those truly deserving of the death penalty suffer the

16

imposition of death.

17

the system are narrowing, particularized, and

18

individualized considerations at the penalty phase and

19

No, Justice Kennedy --- or can you get them to me?
-- and we've tried to kind of run

those down, and they're very elusive.

The classes that

10

simple intent murderers as well as those who murder not in

11

the course of a felony that might be extremely reckless,

12

and they would be preexcluded from the class of first

degree murder.
QUESTION:

But you can't give us any idea of the

15

percentage of the total universe of first degree murders

16

that the excluded portion consists of?

17

MR. BURSON:

18

QUESTION:

No.
General Burson, how are you defining

19

first degree murder if simple intent murder comes within

first degree murder?

MR. BURSON:

24
25

No, simple intent murder does not

come within first degree murder.

murderers that might otherwise be eligible for a capital

What do you mean by simple intent

murder, just to -- what is that?

7

MR. BURSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BURSON:

Well, I mean that -No intent to kill?
Well, that you have an intent --

10

no, that you have an intent to kill as distinguished from

11

premeditated, deliberate, and wilful.

12

W

I said that that is a group of

Tennessee has actually construed, for instance,

13

deliberated that you've got to have a very cool purpose,

14

premeditated, cannot be formed in an instant, it has to be

15

formed in some period of time beyond an instant, and so it

16

would appear that what we would think of as a straight

17

intent murder, with intent formed in an instant, which

18

many jurisdictions allow under premeditation, would be

19

precluded.

20

QUESTION:

In other words, the murders that are

21

eligible are all premeditated murders and all felony

22

murders.

MR. BURSON:

MR. BURSON:

That's correct.

It's our position that the circumstance is
rational in that it clearly, objectively, and specifically
identifies circumstances of first degree murder that don't
embrace all first degree murders.

It's principled in that

it's justifying -QUESTION:

first degree murder that don't embrace all -MR. BURSON:

Yes.
-- first degree murder.

What first

degree murders are not embraced?
MR. BURSON:

Premeditated and deliberate murders

are not embraced and also, today, child abuse murders are
not embraced by the felony murder aggravating
circumstance.
QUESTION:
MR. BURSON:

Oh, by the felony murder -Yes.

I'm sorry for the confusion,

Mr. Chief Justice.

That's

So there's no narrowing at that

All first degree -- everyone that's eligible for

first degree murder -- everyone convicted of a first
10

degree murder, whether felony murder or premeditated

11

murder, is eligible for the death penalty, and all of the

12

narrowing goes on at the sentencing stage, is that right?

13

MR. BURSON:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Is that entirely correct, General

15

Burson?

16

death-eligible in Tennessee, are there not?

17

Certainly there are some homicides that are not

MR. BURSON:

Yes, and -- this -- Mr. Chief

18

Justice, the point I'm trying to make, basically what

1

Tennessee does, it describes first degree murder, which

20

are premeditated murders, felony murders.

21

homicides, all other murders fall below the line into

22

second degree murder, and none of those are -- is it

23

possible to impose the death penalty on.

So it would be perfectly proper to

say that there is some narrowing there, would there not?

MR. BURSON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

Now, in terms of those

3

that are above the line, with respect to the felony murder

category, I take it you agree that the felony murder

aggravator, so-called, does no further narrowing?

6

don't have any disagreement about that, do we?

7
8
9

W

Yes.

MR. BURSON:

It narrows the class of first

degree murders.
QUESTION:

Yes, once it is -- once the murder is

10

classified as a felony murder, once the jury has come in

11

with a verdict to felony murder --

12

MR. BURSON:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- as opposed to premeditated murder,

14

then the possible application later of the felony murder

15

aggravator, so-called, does not narrow that subset of

16

first degree murders, i.e. felony murders, any further.

17

MR. BURSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. BURSON:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.
We agree on that?
Yes.
And as I understand it, your position

21

is there is a further narrowing which is constitutionally

22

sufficient, and that further narrowing is the result of

23

applying, in effect, the Tison standard, the threshold

24

proportionality standard that Tison imposed, right?

MR. BURSON:

That certainly occurs independent

2

during the penalty phase when the jury considers all of

3

the factors that an additional narrowing takes place, but

4

in terms of che recklessness standard, that's

constitutionally required by Tison, and it does restrict

the State's ability to impose death on anyone who does not

application of the Tison standard satisfies the

MR. BURSON:

4

What is the rationale for

Justice Ginsburg, I think we're

5

talking about in premeditated the mens rea of intent.

6

Felony murder would encompass reckless -- extremely

7

reckless murders as well as those who would intend, so in

8

comparing a recklessness mens rea, so to speak, against a

9

premeditated mens rea, the level of intent would have to

10

be greater for premeditated murder.

11

¥

However, the level of culpability, these are all

12

first degree murder offenses.

13

comparable for premeditated murderers and for felony

14

murderers, and what the legislature in Tennessee has

15

determined is that deterrence serves as a justifying

16

rationale to create an aggravating circumstance of felony

17

murder as a class of murderers, and they have come to that

18

conclusion with certain types of premeditated murders such

19

as a police murder, State attorney general murder, that

20

sort of thing, which are purely based upon deterrent

21

reasons.

22

The level of culpability is

But when I suggest that the premeditated

23

standard as intent and deliberateness and coolness is

24

higher than recklessness, I only mean as a mens rea, not

in terms of culpability.

to treat them the same, to say that both are subject to

MR. STEBBINS:

Well, very simply, in the one

it, and perhaps I misunderstand your hypothetical, but

you've got premeditation and something else.

Reckless plus robbery, no death

Premeditated plus robbery, death penalty.

That's what you say is fair and rational.
MR. STEBBINS:

Yes.

I mean, the problem I'm

making, though, is that, not the premeditation plus
robbery, a premeditated murder with nothing else would
satisfy the death penalty, would get a death penalty here.
Reckless, which only becomes the equivalent of a
premeditated murder because it was committed during the
course of a robbery, is then automatically subjected to
the death penalty, whereas with the premeditated murder,
who is already all by itself a highly culpable crime
because of the definition of premeditation -QUESTION:

Your point is that it's irrational,

MR. STEBBINS:

QUESTION:

Not equally, but better -I --

reckless robber is not, so the reckless robber is being

treated better, not the same.

QUESTION:

My point is it's constitutionally

MR. STEBBINS:

But the premeditated robber is

13

being treated worse because of there is an additional

14

element proven in the crime -- the robbery.

15

With the reckless robber, he is being elevated

16

already to being the equivalent of the premeditated

murderer merely by the use of the robbery, and then he's

18

elevated up above that by the use of the robbery also.

reckless murder by itself, without the robbery, would not

The premeditated murder all by itself is death-eligible.
The reckless killer is not death-eligible absent adding
the robbery on top of that.

That raises it up to be first

QUESTION:

So you're saying that in a -- let's

that a State cannot make a felony murder that qualifies

MR. STEBBINS:

Your Honor, I would say that if

you look at this Court's holding in all of its holdings
from like, Gregg, and Zant, and Creech last year, whenever
there has been a definition by a State that is as broad as
this, that includes felony murder with no intent, it
includes plain, premeditated murder as the basis for death
eligibility, that every State where this Court has looked,

necessarily mean that the Constitution requires it.
MR. STEBBINS:

I believe, though, if you look at

this Court's opinion in Lowenfield, for example,
Lowenfield says the States may do two things, they may
broadly define death-eligible crimes, and if they broadly
define them, i.e. saying felony murder or premeditation,
then they must have an aggravating circumstance that
narrows the class, or they may very narrowly define the
class of death-eligible murderers as Texas and Louisiana
have done.

If they do that, then there is no

constitutional requirement for further narrowing.
QUESTION:

Well, so don't you think it

represents a sufficient narrowing in the terms that
Lowenfield used that if they say -- if the State says,
from all homicides we are going to choose premeditated
murder and felony murder that meets the Tison
qualification, and we're not going to have aggravating
circumstances.

We're going to let you show all the

mitigating evidence you want.

plainly that not only must the aggravating circumstance be

definite, but it must genuinely narrow, and do so on a

principled basis, citing Zant v. Stevens primarily for

Tison, that a reckless killer can be equally culpable to a
