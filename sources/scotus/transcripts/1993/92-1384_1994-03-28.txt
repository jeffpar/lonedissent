ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOANNE M. GARVEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER BARCLAYS BANK, PLC
MS. GARVEY:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At issue in this case, the Barclays case, is the

13

constitutionality of worldwide combined reporting as

14

applied to a foreign multinational enterprise.

15

States and the nations of the world all use one method to

16

divide international income for tax purposes - - the arm's

17

length separating accounting method.

18

have agreed to use one, and only one method, demonstrates

19

the essential need for uniformity in this area.

20

The United

That all nations

For over 20 years, California has defied this

21

international standard by applying a different and

22

inconsistent method -- worldwide combined reporting.

23

Whether or not this method is constitutional as applied to

24

a domestic multinational corporation, it's patently

25

unconstitutional when applied to a foreign-owned

Corporation.
First, it prevents the Nation from speaking with

2

3

one voice when regulating foreign commerce, second, it

4

presents a substantial risk of international multiple

5

taxation, and third, as applied by California, it has

6

imposed discriminatory compliance burdens.

7

Now, the California supreme court circumvented

8

these issues by creating a new test for avoiding dormant

9

Commerce Clause analysis.

Under the California supreme

10

court's test, congressional silence replaces the

11

traditional requirement of affirmative congressional

12

action.

13

California's approach has no basis in Wardair or

14

in any other case of this Court.

15

negative implications from congressional enactment, not

16

negative implications for no enactment at all.

17

Wardair looked at the

The California method is practically unworkable

18

19

congressional meaning from an act of legislation.

20

Gleaning congressional meaning from congressional inaction

21

is impossible.

22

It is difficult enough to ascertain a

23

good illustration of the difficulties.

1

possible to discern any senatorial preference or dislike

2

for the use of worldwide combined reporting.
Now,

3

the legislative history of the courts that

4

go to that, because for some reason to text is ambiguous,

5

indicates a Senate preference for barring the States' use

6

of worldwide combined reporting rather than any

7

affirmative congressional policy to permit the States to

8

use that method.

9

QUESTION:

But a preference not strong enough to

10

be reflected in the Senate's exercise of its power,

11

because it didn't have enough votes for the supermajority

12

necessary.

13

MS. GARVEY:

That is correct, and as a result,

14

Justice Rehnquist,

15

sufficient to take the case out of dormant Commerce Clause

16

analysis, which is the State's argument, and moreover, at

17

least some of the supporters of the reservation were

18

concerned about the use of the treaty method rather than

19

with any restriction on worldwide combined reporting to - -

20

by the States as such, and in fact, both of the

21

contracting parties,

22

Kingdom, have made it clear in the past and before this

23

Court that they do not think the treaty reserves the

24

issue,

25

this does not reflect any policy

so - QUESTION:

Nonetheless,

it is clear from the

history that you recited that Congress was certainly well

2

aware of this problem and this debate, and did nothing.

3

MS. GARVEY:

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. GARVEY:

Well -Although it surely could have.
Senatorial awareness, of course --

6

because I don't think both Houses of Congress had

7

addressed the issue -- senatorial awareness is not a

8

substitution for this Court's off-affirmed principle that

9

Congress must act affirmatively to remove the State act

10

from scrutiny by this Court under the dormant Commerce

11

Clause, and in fact, at best, the treaty situation is much

12

like a filibuster in which the majority wasn't sufficient

13

to break the filibuster over a particular provision, and

14

so you had to delete that provision to move the rest of

15

the legislation forward.

16

certainly, indicate congressional policy in favor of the

17

opposite of the deleted provision.

18

QUESTION:

That deletion would not,

There was in the Wardair case, as you

19

mentioned, the use of the words, affirmatively acted, but

20

the affirmative action was by nonaction, right, by failure

21

to forbid the State taxes?

22

MS. GARVEY:

Yes, but you had a prohibition.

23

Actually, you did have an action which was a direct

24

prohibition on the use of a portion of State taxes.

25

The Chicago convention contained an enactment in

From that, plus the fact that the Court had the

In this case, we

The United States has acknowledged the validity

The second reason, even if the objective

Foreign

evidence of foreign policy implications were not present,

10

application of the Container objective factors

11

demonstrates that in the circumstances present here,

12

foreign offense is inevitable.
First of all, foreign multinationals are exposed

13
14

to a. greater risk of double tax because, typically, more

15

of their operations are in jurisdictions which have the

16

primary right to tax that income that California includes

17

in its tax base, and second, a foreign Government's own

18

interests are affected.

19

Under the international practice, the home

20

nation has the obligation to relieve double tax, and if a

21

foreign nation has to relieve excess tax from the

22

California system, the nation then has the Hobson's choice

23

of relieving the tax and affecting its own revenues, or

24

making its businesses less competitive by not relieving

25

the tax.

No, that argument was not available -QUESTION:

Well, but were there not foreign

11

affiliates in Container Corp.?

12

MS. GARVEY:

13

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And would not a foreign nation under

14

your hypothesis have felt some duty to lesson the impact

15

of the California tax on those foreign affiliates that

16

were within its jurisdiction?

17

MS. GARVEY:

No, because the obligation to

18

relieve the tax flows back to the home country.

19

Container case, that would have been the United States,

20

and plus there was no obligation on a foreign affiliate,

21

for example, doing business in Italy.

QUESTION:

2

I still don't quite understand.

If

3

an English -- the English Government is concerned that one

4

of its subsidiaries -- one of its corporations, which is a

5

subsidiary of an American company, is paying too much tax

6

in California, then wouldn't it have the same motive to

7

give it some amelioratory treatment as it would in the

8

case that you have posed?

9

MS. GARVEY:
QUESTION:

10

Right.
I don't see why it makes a difference

11

that there is a parent in one case and a subsidiary in the

12

other.

13

MS. GARVEY:

Well, if I might try to see if I

14

can answer that in this fashion, Justice Kennedy, first of

15

all, in Container, the ultimate parent was the United

16

Kingdom company -- I'm sorry, a United States company.

17

The subsidiary could be a foreign subsidiary of any

18

nation.

19

The impact of the tax was actually in the United

20

States, and so there was no interest, or no problem

21

necessarily arising directly on the foreign subsidiary in

22

that circumstance.

23

In this case, the foreign parent is the --a

24

United Kingdom corporation, and in fact one of the

25

taxpayers is also a United Kingdom corporation, a second

1

level subsidiary, and so when the tax falls on the

2

taxpayer here, ultimately the burden falls back into the

3

United Kingdom group and the parent company, because it

4

will be the United Kingdom, as the ultimate sovereign of

5

the parent, that must decide whether to grant a credit to

6

relieve the taxation on income earned abroad by either the

domestic subsidiary, in this case a United Kingdom

corporation, not the United States, so the argument was

not available to - -

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. GARVEY:

12

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about -Yes, Justice Stevens.
Isn't the assumption, if you think

13

this very complex system really works, that all that's

14

being taxed is income earned in California, and that one

15

looks at the other income only for the purpose of

16

determining what share of the total is attributable to

17

California?

18

MS. GARVEY:

Justice Stevens, I would have to

19

respectfully disagree.

20

income of the worldwide group wherever earned, into a

21

single pool, and then divides that income according to a

formula ignoring geographic boundaries profitability and

MS. GARVEY:

Right.
Yes, so for purposes of this --

13

however, under the international standard, division of the

14

income is done on an entirely different basis, but for

15

purposes of the California methodology, it's a little

16

difficult to say that anyone is simply measuring by a

17

worldwide pool of income which requires worldwide

18

information gathering even to begin to compute the tax to

say that you're only taxing California income, but the

only taxing that proportion of the total which the

business in California represents to the total?

3

MS. GARVEY:

amount, then the system -- yes, you would only be taxing

California income.

1

nations as to how you divide the tax base, because in a

2

unitary business or in a worldwide group, you eventually

3

end up with a base, and the question is internationally

4

how do you divide it?

5

Because foreign nations are more likely to be

6

doing business in jurisdictions that under the

7

international standard, the international practice, have

8

primary right to tax, it is more likely than not that a

9

portion of the income which California claims is going to

10

be included in the tax base that some other nation has the

11

right also to tax, and in this case there was actual

12

double taxation, but the problem essentially is, you have

13

two competing and incompatible systems, and as a result,

14

whether you have double tax on every -- on a day-to-day

15

basis, you have the risk, because the two systems are

16

inapposite and cannot be reconciled.

17

QUESTION:

What is it that you mean by a

MS. GARVEY:

Under the international system, the

international practice that we've referred to of arm's

length, separate accounting, there are some basic rules.

MS. GARVEY:

That is -- if the worldwide

5

reporting system were all applied in the same fashion, the

6

answer would be yes.

7

this, the answer would clearly be yes, but the problem is,

8

no nation of the world uses this, and so as a result,

9

under the dormant Commerce Clause, the inquiry before the

If all nations of the world used

10

Court is whether or not uniformity is essential, and the

11

Court has set forth tests as to whether that is essential.
One test, as here, where a State tax is at

12

13

variance, is where it implicates foreign policy, and this

14

case probably presents one of the clearest evidences of

15

implication of foreign policy.

16

We have offense, we have the problems of the

17

objective factors, we have the compliance burdens, and we

18

have the longstanding difficulties in terms of trying to

19

comply both with respect to the implications, but also

20

with the stand-alone issues of burden, which is a

21

discriminatory effect, and the double taxes we have just

discussed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. KLEIER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY

MR. KLEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Today is the culmination of 11 years of national

7

and international reaction to this Court's decision in the

8

Container case.

9

including reactions from the Federal Government and

The immediate aftermath of that decision,

10

foreign Governments, resulted in the formation of the

11

President's Worldwide Unitary Taxation Working Group, and

12

ultimately President Reagan's statement directing

13

executive departments to act to end worldwide combination.

14

The case which provoked this Federal and

15

international outcry was Container, a case which, like

16

Colgate, involved a U.S.-based group engaged in foreign

17

commerce.

18

this case, demonstrates that the result in Container was

19

wrong.

Container to the record in this case.

developed since Container?

QUESTION:

us of the position the Federal Government takes, but

surely that's not conclusive.

7

MR. KLEIER:

It certainly is not conclusive, and

indeed, that was set forth in Container.
What I'm suggesting is that the record in this

8

case chronicles a series of pieces of evidence of what the

9

policy is and of that interference, and certainly the

10

Solicitor General's submission in this case, President

11

Reagan's statement, those are all pieces of evidence.

12

QUESTION:

And you draw from these various

13

pieces, as you describe them, the conclusion that

14

Container was wrong?

15

MR. KLEIER:

That the result in Container was

16

wrong, yes, Your -- yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist, because

17

Container did not have before it evidence that the Chicago

18

Bridge and Iron case represented the continuing position

19

of the Federal Government, and furthermore, Container did

20

not have before it evidence that there is a purpose to

21

U.S. foreign policy that is - - that worldwide combination

22

interferes with.

there is a purpose, a key element of U.S. foreign policy

advantage they desired in our markets without granting us

any return.

14

QUESTION:

Well, if it's at the very heart of

15

the Foreign Commerce Clause, one would think you wouldn't

need statements by President Reagan or a brief from the

17

Solicitor General to confirm it.

18

MR. KLEIER:

Certainly that -- first you have to

19

determine that the interest is at the heart of the

20

Commerce Clause, then, what the Court requires further is

21

some indication that there is interference by California's

method with that purpose of the Commerce Clause, and that

is what is supplied beginning with the statement in the

In addition to this violation of a clear Federal

directive, the Container court expressly acknowledged the

opinion, and had to see -- basically could not determine

Congress, foreign commerce is.
MR. KLEIER:

The Commerce Clause certainly

entrusts the power to regulate commerce to Congress.

10

Nonetheless, this Court has recognized that entrusting

11

that power to Congress has to keep the States out of

12

certain areas, and as evidence of what areas the State

13

should be kept out of, this Court has historically looked

14

to indications from the Executive Branch of whether a

15

particular area is one that the States should not

16

interfere in, even in the absence of congressional

17

regulation.

18

QUESTION:

Well, whatever the rule should be for

19

determining the foreign policy position of the United

States -- and this case itself shows that that's a very

difficult determination to make -- once this Court has

isn't very good at getting involved in, and particularly

the foreign commerce area is one of these.

MR. KLEIER:

You would hope that that might

provide some incentive to act.

the sensitive nature and competing interests at stake,

question, in the aftermath of Container, would you agree

that there is at least one point on which Congress does

have a particular competence, and that is the capacity in

effect to change a tax rule without raising the kinds of

problems of retrospectivity and refund that would be the

case if we saw things your way?

7

Congress really could do a much better job of,

8

as it were, adjusting the balance, than we could, could it

not?

10

MR. KLEIER:

Justice Souter, the problem, I

11

guess, is Congress getting to that point, because it does

12

involve questions of how foreign commerce is taxed, and

13

that being an area where Congress has particular

14

difficulty to even substantively get to the question where

the remedy is.

about refund, California reliance, and so on, is that not

the case?

3

MR. KLEIER:

Well, certainly there are issues

4

with respect to the refund in this case, and I submit that

5

those same issues would exist in the event that Congress

6

was to come to the table.

7

The problem is that by the time Congress acts

8

with respect to this question, there are going to have

9

been a number of years that elapse where California has

10

intruded in an area of foreign commerce, basically has

11

interfered with an area where uniformity is essential, and

contrary to a Federal directive.

in terms of the pace and the sensitivity with which

5

Congress can deal with those questions, and that --

QUESTION:

Well, but you could say that about

any branch of the law, where something came up in Congress

were so many different opinions on the subject, and we

don't generally say well, that means Congress has kind of

defaulted so somebody else is going to step in.

MR. KLEIER:

Well, certainly in most areas there

13

is no -- that's right -- overriding interest that simply

14

the fact of disagreement should have any effect, but when

foreign commerce and foreign nations are involved, and the

that the doctrine of Container be applied, but we are

asking that it be applied to the facts that are before the

interests that are protected by the Commerce Clause.

take seriously efforts by the President to eliminate

15

unequal treatment of U.S.-based businesses in foreign

16

markets, as, for example, in the recent trade negotiations

with Japan, if those foreign Governments see that the

ultimately that power was given to Congress, but what he

2

was explaining was the need to keep the States out, and it

3

is that need to keep the States out where this Court has

sometimes looked not only to congressional statutes, but

5

to sometimes less formal directives in the area of foreign

policy and foreign commerce which are not evidenced in any

7

statute or in any treaty.

9

With respect to the Solicitor General's
suggestion that it is not present policy which controls,

10

and instead it is only some historical policy, the impact

11

of a tax on foreign commerce is certainly not felt at the

12

time a tax is accrued.

collected and levied that the impact in international

14

trade is felt.

It is, indeed, when a tax is

no precedent in this Court's decision for such an

approach.

In Itel, Container, and Japan Line, in none of

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In the view of the United States, petitioners

23

have not sustained their burden of showing that the taxes

24

at issue in this case were unconstitutional, whether their

25

claims are viewed from the perspective of California law

as it exists today, or from the perspective of a legal

2

situation that existed during the tax years at issue.

3

QUESTION:

General Days, do you take the

4

position that the California tax is perfectly valid today

5

as applied to Barclays?

6

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes, we do.

Our position is that

7

insofar as the issue presented in this case is the ability

8

of the Federal Government to achieve uniformity in foreign

9

affairs or speak with one voice, that what California has

10

done as of September 10, 1993, to change its law and

11

provide corporations like Barclays with an option, an

12

election to adopt water's edge --

GENERAL DAYS:

15

QUESTION:

16

GENERAL DAYS:

How about September 9th?
September 9th?

Before they adopted it.
Before they adopted it, we have

17

not taken a position in this case as to whether it would

18

satisfy the standards that we've set out.

Well, I'm asking you what your

20

position is as of September 9th and before they adopted

21

this change.

22

1

that the same analysis that we've utilized with respect to

2

the tax years at issue in our brief is the one that should

3

be applied here.
What we have on September 9th, 1993, is a

4
5

situation where California has changed its law in 1986 to

6

provide a water's edge election, and so it seems to us

7

that for the Court to determine whether there was a

8

violation between 1986 and September 9th, 1993, would

9

depend upon whether during that period the United States

10

felt that it could not speak with one voice, or that there

11

was a need for Federal uniformity.
QUESTION:

12

Well, if the 1970 California tax were

13

still in operation, the tax that Barclays objects to, if

14

it were still in operation, what then would be your

15

position as to its validity?
GENERAL DAYS:

16

Our position would be that during

17

the period from 1980 through 1986, there were expressions

18

of concern by the Federal Government -- that is, by the

19

executive branch -- with respect to the California taxing

20

scheme.

21

what we saw as our history indicates in our brief, a

22

movement on the part of the executive branch to seek

23

legislation, and then a pulling back in response to

24

California's change in its law.

25

Thereafter, there was a change in the policy and

We have not gone through a thorough analysis of

1

that period, because as we've suggested to the Court, the

2

issue presented by this case is whether American foreign

3

policy during the tax year in question was in fact such

4

that California's practice was unconstitutional under the

5

Foreign Commerce Clause.

6

QUESTION:

Well, would it be constitutional,

7

consistent with our foreign policy interests, for

8

California today to reinstate the worldwide reporting
statute that it seeks to apply to Barclays?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

I think, Justice Kennedy, that

11

what would be necessary is an evaluation of the principles

12

that have been set out by this Court in Japan Line and

13

Container Corporation.

14

I think we have to start from the proposition

15

that California has been using a method that this Court

16

upheld in Container Corporation.

17

where California is trying to tax income that is not

18

justifiably taxed by the State of California.

1

this Court has said that California's method is really a

20

benchmark insofar as taxing schemes, apportionment schemes

21

are concerned.

22

QUESTION:

It's not a situation

In fact,

But I take it you cannot say with

23

assurance that under my hypothetical case the statute

24

would be consistent with our foreign policy interests.

25

That is correct.

We are very

1

clear, looking at the record as to the tax year in

record reflects is a preference on the part of the United

So our analysis should just turn on

8

when the executive branch has spoken, and with what

9

clarity, and that's what turns the tide?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

Not at all, Justice O'Connor.

11

The suggestion that briefs filed by the executive branch,

12

or, indeed, executive branch pronouncements, determine the

13

constitutional issue before the Court, is not an argument

14

that we're making.

15

What we see the situation presented as being is

16

a case where we know that the Federal Government has

17

foreign affairs concerns, we have a State taxing in a way

18

that this Court has said is constitutional, and so the

19

question is, what does the Court look to in the absence of

20

an explicit statement by Congress through statute, or by

21

way of a treaty?

22

We think that under those circumstances it's

23

appropriate for the Court to look at what the executive

24

branch has done, what was executive branch policy during

25

that period.

2

QUESTION:

Sort of a Teague rule for the

Commerce Clause?

3

(Laughter.)

4

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, not quite, Your Honor.

5

It's really a question of taking that as evidence, and to

6

the extent that there's been citation to briefs filed in

7

this case and in other cases expressing the views of the

8

United States, as we've argued in our brief, it's

9

important for the Court to look at not the briefs as an

10

indication of American foreign policy or executive branch

11

policy, but to look at them only to the extent that they

12

reflect foreign policy determinations that have been made

13

elsewhere, and in this case we are suggesting that

14

whatever briefs may have been filed subsequently, they did

15

not focus on the tax years at issue.

16

If one focuses on those tax years, as I've

17

indicated, we see a preference but not a policy, a

18

willingness on the part of the executive branch to allow

19

States, except in the context of the U.K.-U.S. tax

20

convention originally, to tax foreign nationals using the

21

worldwide combined reporting method, and therefore we

22

think that that is the correct representation.

23

But to return to my other point -- it's a point

24

raised, I think, by Justice Souter's question -- what does

25

the Court do under these circumstances?

It seems to us,

1

however the Court resolves this issue, and with regard to

2

whatever years, that this is really a third party claim on

3

the part of Barclays.

4

What we ultimately are boiling this case down to

5

is whether what California was doing prevented the Federal

6

Government from speaking with one voice or achieving

7

uniformity.

8

California in September of last year, whatever retaliatory

9

concerns that might have been raised for the entire

We think that with the change made by

10

Federal Government, certainly for the executive branch,

11

have been removed, and therefore this is not a situation

12

where we have a discriminatory tax.

14

Justice Stevens, you're exactly correct on the
whole question of what's being taxed.

GENERAL DAYS:

It is something that the Court

20

has to take into consideration in determining objective

21

considerations, whether what California or Vermont is

22

doing violates the Foreign Commerce Clause, but failing a

23

clear answer with respect to those objective inquiries, it

24

is our position that one place to look is to the executive

25

branch, and what we are saying not as a matter of history,

but speaking about the contemporaneous relationship of the

2

United States Government with our trading partners that

3

what California has done has removed whatever tension

4

might have been presented at an earlier point by what

5

California was doing.

6

This is also not a situation where there is

7

anything to be served by paying California's taxes back to

8

Barclays in the form of a refund.

9

is infeasible under these circumstances.

Backward-looking relief

To the extent that what California has done to

impair the Federal Government's relations in the foreign

affairs area, that has already been accomplished.

that we should look at this the same way Congress would

look at it, aren't you?

21

that because the retaliatory effect is less with respect

to an event subsequent to the tax years in question, that

GENERAL DAYS:

Certainly, this Court has never

explicitly held -- may I complete the answer? --

3

explicitly held this, but we think that looking at this

4

Court's decisions with respect to refunds of taxes, this

5

Court has held that refunds were required when it was a

6

matter of discrimination, where the tax went beyond merely

7

what was legitimate within the taxing jurisdiction, or

8

where the parties taxed were immune from taxation.

We think that this particular situation is

unique, and therefore are suggesting that the Court adopt

a unique remedy.

MR. LADDISH:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
It's extremely helpful for the Solicitor General

20

to point out a fatal flaw in the taxpayers' approach, but

stars of Commerce Clause navigation.

statements or anything of the like.

And second, that there must be a clear line of

3

demarcation maintained between a dormant Commerce Clause

4

analysis and a nondormant Commerce Clause analysis, and

5

confusion results from the taxpayers' brief in this area.

6

Well, what is dormant?

7

dormant when it's hibernating, Congress is dormant as to a

8

Commerce Clause issue when it is not making decisions on

9

that issue informing United States law.

Well, just a grizzly bear is

What is not dormant?

10

Well, if the bear's out of

11

the den, down at the stream choosing which fish to swat up

12

on the shore and which fish to let go by, that bear is not

13

dormant as to any of those fish.

14

informing the commerce law of the United States, is

15

choosing which tax practice to prohibit and which tax

practice to let go by, then Congress is not dormant as to

any of those tax issues that are under congressional

scrutiny.

Similarly, if Congress,

maybe it's the theory adopted by the court below that

12

such implied permission exists, then the one voice has

spoken through the congressional actions and no dormant

on the nondormant side.

MR. LADDISH:

QUESTION:

MR. LADDISH:

Oh, the text.

Yes.
Yes.

The text is -- as it came

4

out and was approved by the Senate, the text was "this

5

limitation applies to the national government," and

6

there's no mention of the States in that particular text.

7

The States are mentioned in the treaty, that States are

8

subjected to other limitations.

separate treaties or separate agreements, the States were

Just as in Wardair, in

10

subjected to certain limitations and not others.

11

have one document with a synergistic combination of both

12

of the types of implications from Wardair.

13

Here we

Adding to that, you have the implication of

14

through the history of these bilateral treaties where the

15

international model treaty of the OECD would restrict the

16

States, as well as the national government, to the

17

arms-length approach, thus barring them from using the

18

unitary business approach, particularly as to branches of

19

the corporations.

20

In all the treaties, in dozens and dozens -- in

21

every United States bilateral income tax treaty through

22

the years, the Federal Government has been subjected to an

23

arms-length limitation and the States have not been

24

subjected to that limitation.

25

the table as to these treaties because there are these

Certainly, the issue was on

model foreign treaties that would have subjected the

2

States.

3

And, in fact, in a considerable number of these

4

treaties which are set forth on page 17 of the Alaska

5

brief in support of our position, there are a significant

6

number of these treaties where the political subdivision

7

of the other States of the other Nation were subjected to

8

this arms-length restriction, and still the States of the

9

United States were not.

10

So I submit that the indications, certainly in

11

the Wardair treaty with the history, but forget the

12

history, look to the language of the U.S.-U.K. treaty and

13

to the other dozens and dozens of United States treaties.

14

The common feature in all of those -- and if this is the

15

international standard, I'm perfectly happy to live with

16

it -- is that the national governments are restricted to

17

the use of the arms-length approach.

18

governments are not, and thus can use the unitary business

19

approach with its formulary apportionment of income, one

20

form of which is worldwide combined reporting.

21

The State

So under Wardair, and under the Itel Containers

22

case from 1993, if the standard is put in Itel, the most

23

rational inference to be drawn from the body of law, from

24

the treaties themselves, Federal law, is that the States

25

are impliedly permitted to use worldwide combined

Does the record tell us at all what

the difference in money would be if California were

collecting based on the arms-length method as opposed to

5

the worldwide combined - -

6

MR. LADDISH:

What the record shows is that --

7

as to the differences in the amounts between the returns

8

that were filed and the assessments as to tax amounts, for
Barclays Bank International it was $1,678; for Barclays

10

Bank of California, for example, it was $152,470.

11

was approximately 12 percent and 28 percent, respectively,

12

difference between the systems.

13

But I would like to point out --

QUESTION:

That

Does the system that California uses

impact particularly because California has high property

16

values or perhaps high wages or something, and these are

17

part of the formula - -

18

MR. LADDISH:

Well, I should point out --

1

there's an assumption -- and I was going to wait until I

20

got to my dormant Commerce Clause analysis, but I think

21

there's an assumption we have to dispel here that somehow

22

we collect excess taxes and we cost the taxpayers the

23

inordinate amount of money to comply with our wild scheme

24

of taxation.

25

First, I'd point out that this Court, in

1

Container, which is consistent with this Court's doctrine

2

through 70 years of Court procedure, has held that this is

3

a proper and fair method of taxation, that it is a method

4

of taxation that fairly apportions income to the taxing

5

jurisdiction with a reasonable sense of how income is

6

generated, and that -- and this is the word from

7

Container -- it avoids the basic theoretical weaknesses of

8

arms-length separate accounting, such as giving the
taxpayer the chance for manipulations through tax havens

10
11

and this sort of thing.
Through the arms-length method, the Federal

12

Government -- and this is on much congressional discussion

13

and everything else - - the Federal Government is having a

14

terrible time trying to use the arms-length method, trying

15

to catch up with taxpayers and enforce the Federal tax.

16

The States' approach of worldwide combined reporting, all

17

the taxpayer needs to provide, basically, is the

18

California and worldwide respectively property, payroll,

1

and sales, and the worldwide net income.

20

Any business is going to keep track of those

21

things, no matter how many countries they're in.

That's

22

the sort of thing they keep track of for their own

23

taxpayers, for any filings they might have to make with

24

the United States SEC if they're going to be selling any

25

shares of stock in the United States.

information that they will have.
And as the court of appeal below has held in

3

Barclays, the California system provides for a

4

user-friendly system of reasonable approximations where

5

the Franchise Tax Board is to look at the financial

6

records of the corporation and work from there, if at all

7

possible, open to any time that the taxpayer wants to come

8

in with its actual refiguring under the exact technical

determinations of the system, if they don't want to use

11

the reasonable approximations.

MR. LADDISH:

As the testimony indicates, it

would be a substantial burden whether it was foreign

QUESTION:

6

Well, but that doesn't quite square

7

with your argument that everybody has these figures and

8

it's easy to give the figures.

9

MR. LADDISH:

Well, it's that if they were going

10

to do -- everybody has those figures in their financial

11

accounting records which, as the court of appeal has held,

12

the board of franchise - - the Franchise Tax Board has to

13

consider those in applying the reasonable approximations

approach.

much to go set up -- and this is what the $2 million, $5

subsidiary is going to have a separate set of books for

The Franchise Tax Board has never required that.

21

We've looked at our requirements and we say, yes, that

through the California system.

They claim risks, but as

2

this Court in Complete Auto Transit indicates, just a

3

claiming of a risk of discrimination is not enough; you

4

have to show there's some injury, and they have not done

5

that.
I would like to mention the taxpayers and the

executive branch approach to the dormant Commerce Clause,

8

where they would give determinative weight, under varying

9

circumstances, depending on which person you're listening

10

to,

11

binding Federal one voice Commerce Clause policy that

12

could somehow preempt the States.

13

is not truly a dormant Commerce Clause analysis, because

14

in a dormant context you cannot have such a binding

15

Federal policy.

to the bind -- to Federal pronouncements under - - as a

But this would -- this

It's -- a very similar argument was rejected by

17

this Court in the Wardair case where the executive branch,

18

the Solicitor General argued that a resolution of ICAO,

19

which is an international body, expressed the

20

international policy which the executive branch joined in,

21

that should be determinative in that case.

22

looked at that resolution and said, well,

23

this is a common aspiration that's being voiced here of

24

the body, but this Court rejected any policy significance

25

for this resolution because it had no force of law.

And this Court
this is a - -

Executive branch pronouncement must have the force of law

before it can possibly preempt the States' power to tax,

which this Court most recently in Oregon v. ACF held that

this -- the power to tax is central to State sovereignty.

The Constitution provides a very carefully

crafted system of Federalism with the States having

certain protections within that Federal system.

9

the power to control or to regulate commerce to Congress

By giving

10

and by setting forth procedural rules like the two-thirds

11

vote required for Senate approval of any treaty, the

12

Constitution has forged a balance between the national

need for a capability of imposing a uniform commerce

policy on the States and the need under Federalism for the

States to have a voice, through their elected

representatives, in the formation of any such policy.

that in a dormant, truly dormant one voice situation, the

question is is uniformity of the State tax practice with

this question as to whether the basic Commerce Clause

6

interests require uniformity of the State and Federal tax

practices is a question -- one this Court has testing, and

8

should look at under current circumstances.

9

And we submit that

This is because we view this Court in a dormant

If the Court here looks at the complaints that

are made in this case by the foreign governments, what the

Court will hear is a complete rehash of the arguments

which this Court flatly rejected in Container.

21

the foreign governments simply will not agree with this

Court, or let on that they agree that this Court has held

that worldwide combined reporting is proper and fair, and

24

that it apportions income in a fair manner.

As in Allied

What you're hearing from the foreign governments

is just the same complaints you heard in Container.

5

it's -- I submit that this Court has given the foreign

6

governments a chance to come up with something new and

7

they have not.

8

perhaps foreign governments could provide, and the

9

taxpayers could argue, that there is a true implication of

So - - but that, in another context,

foreign affairs.
Here if the foreign governments were really

11
12

arguing what their real interests are, what they would be

13

telling this Court is we want California to be bound to

14

the same arms-length approach that the States are -- or

15

that the Federal Government is, because the Federal

16

Government cannot possibly administer that tax and our

taxpayers can find ways of manipulating their books to get

around it.

havens to our taxpayers.

20

We would be hearing we like to provide tax

And so if the California method is taken away --

21

the ability to impose worldwide combined reporting is

22

taken away from the States, we won't have to worry about

that anymore and the tax havens can continue to be just as

effective as they are with the Federal Government.

arms-length separate accounting, what it is doing is

2

gradually getting as close as possible to a global

formulary apportionment of income, as can be done under

the treaties that restrict it to arms length.

5

So the Federal -- the foreign governments'

6

complaints really are just a rehash of what this Court has

already rejected in Container.

8

course, has put a retaliatory statute on its books, and it

9

will brandish that statute for dramatic effect whenever it

And the United Kingdom, of

10

feels that it's appropriate, and yet it hasn't ever

11

implemented that statute.

12

And, of course,

the reason is clear.

The

13

Federal Government has testified before Congress that

14

implementation of that statute by the United Kingdom would

15

be a direct violation of the U.S.-U.K. treaty which the

16

U.K. bargained for and signed onto knowing that it had

17

been unsuccessful in its attempts to have the States

18

barred from using worldwide combined reporting.

19

I'd like to point out that as to our arguments

20

on the executive branch -- excuse me, as to -- back now to

21

the nondormant side,

22

confirmed that Congress has acquiesced in the States' use

23

of worldwide combined reporting.

statements -- or, excuse me, actual actions show -- like

2

when they drafted their own model income tax treaty, they

3

made it very clear that the national government would be

4

subjected to the arms-length restrictions, but the States

5

would not.
When the foreign model treaties are drafted by

6

7

the OECD, why the Federal Government -- the executive

8

branch has entered formal reservations to those treaties.

9

When after the U.S.-U.K. treaty, the other foreign

10

governments wanted the executive branch to negotiate the

11

same sort of ban on the States' use of worldwide combined

12

reporting as it had in the U.S.-U.K. treaty, the executive

13

branch pointed to the actions of the Senate and said, no,

14

we will not do that; it would not be successful in the

15

Congress.

16

The executive branch, when it has wanted to

17

change the States' use of worldwide combined reporting,

18

has not tried to issue its own Federal - - clear Federal

19

directive prohibiting the States' use.

as it applies now permitting the States.

It has, instead,

The issue has been fought through in the

dozens and dozens of other income tax treaties, bilateral

combined reporting, is only doing what these treaties

2

permit the States to do, and nothing that the executive

3

branch or the foreign governments or the taxpayers can say

4

or do can negate this congressional acquiescence in the

5

State tax.

6

I might point out that the 1993 California

7

legislation, as the Solicitor General pointed out, is the

8

culmination of a campaign by the executive branch for the

9

States to adopt a compromise solution, the water's edge

10

approach, which contains both worldwide combined reporting

11

elements and separate accounting elements.

12

tax law has been inserted in 1993, which amended a 1986

13

statute, the United Kingdom has withdrawn its threats of

14

retaliation for the moment and has recognized -- at least

15

impliedly recognized that such retaliation would not be

16

justifiable at this point.

And since that

Congress, that has been submitted to Congress.

Congress

2

has acted to permit the States' use of worldwide combined

reporting.

4

Congress has not, Congress has at least indicated that

5

uniformity of the State tax practice, in a dormant

Commerce Clause context with the Federal tax practice, is

not essential, which should end this Court's -- any of

this Court's considerations under a dormant Commerce

2

Solicitor General and in its briefs, actually continues to

3

underscore the reasons why this Court should rule in

4

Barclays favor.
First, the current administration did not

5
6

support California until California changed its law to

7

bring it into ostensible conformity with international

8

practice.

And, in fact, as the California legislative

committee reports acknowledge, the change in the law was
10

requested by the administration to avoid retaliation,

11

which shows the clear causal connection between

12

utilization of this State tax to divide international

13

income and the problems and the implications on United

14

States foreign policy.

15

And the Solicitor General also mentioned, but

16

the brief clearly brings out, that the United States

17

continues to supports Barclays on very significant points.

18

California's Wardair analysis is inapplicable in the eyes

1

of the United States.

20

dormant Commerce Clause analysis, worldwide combined

21

reporting is unconstitutional when it is incompatible with

22

the international practice, and it is incompatible.

23

So when all is said and done, the current

And, second, under the applicable

administration's difference with Barclays is a tiny issue.

executive pronouncements to make the tax unconstitutional
