ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WAGNER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WAGNER:

11
12

The Court remains in session.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

13

The question presented in this case is whether

14

or not the doctrine of forum non conveniens, as that

15

doctrine has been articulated in the admiralty courts, is

16

applicable to maritime claims when filed in State court

17

pursuant to the "saving to suitors" clause of 28 U.S.C.

18

section 1333.
American Dredging, the petitioner, asks that you

19
20

answer that question in the affirmative for two strong

21

reasons.

22

is a fundamental and an important feature of the admiralty

23

law which should be respected and applied uniformly by all

24

courts in all situations, regardless of whether filed in

25

State or Federal court, regardless of the citizenship,

First, we respectfully submit that this doctrine

2

nationality, or residence of the parties.
QUESTION:

Wasn't the first time that this Court

3

enunciated that doctrine and recognized it was not in

4

admiralty, it was in a diversity case -- Gulf Oil?

5

MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, I would suggest that

6

the first time this Court officially recognized that

7

doctrine was in the Belgenland case in 1885, where it

8

recognized that the Court could dismiss a claim in dicta

9

for the same reasons as forum non conveniens, although

10

they did not articulate the Latin phrase, forum non

11

conveniens.

12

QUESTION:

My concern is that you're constantly

13

associating this with admiralty, and yet as far as I know

14

it was part of equity, and it was also -- in Gulf Oil it

15

was a straight law case for damages, so forum non

16

convenisns seems to me across-the-board doctrine that

17

applies in cases at law, equity, and in admiralty.

18

MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, the first articulation

19

of the doctrine using the term, forum non conveniens, did

20

appear in a nonadmiralty case, but that case draws its

21

roots, or has its roots exclusively in the admiralty.

22

the older cases of 1804, where Chief Justice Story

23

referred to the convenience of the parties as being able

24

to be considered, and whether a court would retain

25

jurisdiction in an admiralty salvage case.

In

In 1885, in a collision case, an admiralty-

1

2

collision case, the court recognized the discretion of the

3

trial court in weighing the various factors of

4

convenience, of nationality, of citizenship, in

5

determining whether to retain jurisdiction.

6

QUESTION:

What about in England --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Wagner -- Mr. Wagner, the fact

8

that the doctrine may have come up and been applied in

9

some admiralty cases I don't think negates the suggestion

10

from Justice Ginsburg that it was applied across the

11

board.

12

MR. WAGNER:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Right.
It was applied in admiralty cases and

in other kinds of cases.
MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, I -- Mr. Chief Justice,

16

we agree that -- with that principle, that is now a

17

doctrine, whose efficacy, whose utility has been

18

recognized in many other areas of law.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Wagner, even if you're correct

20

that it was first enunciated in dictum in admiralty cases

21

in this country, was it first enunciated in the common law

22

in admiralty cases?

23

cases it first came up not in admiralty cases at all.

24
25

MR. WAGNER:

My impression was that in the English

I think, Justice Scalia, that the

first consideration of it that I'm aware of was in cases

1

in Scotland which were not

2

QUESTION:

Scottish trust cases, right.

3

MR. WAGNER:

-- maritime cases, that's correct,

4

but my argument, or our principle here is that the

5

admiralty law has a respected position by virtue of the

6

Constitution, and that this particular doctrine, albeit

7

with some roots in nonadmiralty, is a fundamental part of

8

admiralty jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

9

May I ask you what you meant when you

10

said earlier that it's important that this doctrine be

11

applied uniformly?

12

a State court could not be neither more restrictive nor

13

less restrictive in its doctrine of forum non conveniens?

Does that mean that you would say that

14

MR. WAGNER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WAGNER:

My -Neither way.
My reference is that the rule

17

should be uniform, but the interpretation of the rule is

18

always subject to this discretionary input of the trial

19

judge.

20

I do not think -QUESTION:

Well, of course, but I'm -- you would

21

say that a State, even if it wants to exclude on the basis

22

of forum non conveniens more cases than the Federal courts

23

would exclude, it cannot do that.

24
25

MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, that's our position.

That's our position.

QUESTION:

1

But then you're saying that this

2

doctrine must mean something different in admiralty than

3

it does in other areas, because what do you do with

4

Mayfield, where the Court made it clear that a State

5

doesn't have to copy the Federal position on forum non

6

conveniens?

7

can dismiss if it wants it.
MR. WAGNER:

8

9

It can keep the case if it wants it, and it

Justice Ginsburg, my response with

reference to the Mayfield decision, which was the 1950

10

decision of this Court, was that it did not involve any of

11

the constitutional or supremacy issues associated with the

12

general maritime law, which has --

13

QUESTION:

But you just said that the doctrine

14

is the same, the forum non conveniens doctrine is a

15

doctrine that cuts across the law.

16

saying that it's different in admiralty than it is in

17

other areas.

18

MR. WAGNER:

Now you seem to be

Your Honor I may be misstating

19

myself.

20

saying is, the admiralty doctrine has been adopted by

21

several other areas of law, and those other areas of law

22

are free, because they are not constricted, by the

23

uniformity of the general maritime law, to change and

24

apply that doctrine in different fashions, but in

25

admiralty, the Federal courts, and this Court in

I may not be making myself clear.

What I'm

1

particular, is the ultimate arbiter of what the uniform

2

rule should be.

3

QUESTION:

I'm not following your argument.

4

You've already recognized, in response to Justice Scalia's

5

question, that forum non conveniens does not emerge in the

6

common law world for the first time in the context of

7

admiralty, and it is a doctrine that is now applied across

8

the board to cases that were once in equity at law in

9

admiralty, but now you seem to be saying that this

10

doctrine has some special character in admiralty cases

11

that differs it from its shape in other cases.

12

MR. WAGNER:

I believe that it does, and it has

13

that in two fashions, 1) because it is a part of the

14

uniform admiralty law, which has a precedence, it has a

15

supremacy that common law doesn't necessarily have, and

16

secondly, the admiralty jurisdiction is by its nature

17

extremely broad, extremely vast.

18

areas of law.

19

QUESTION:

It touches all sorts of

Why should it have a different

20

application in admiralty than, say, under the FELA, which

21

is a Federal statute?

22

MR. WAGNER:

Well, I would argue that the first

23

reason is because of Article 3, section 2, clause 1 of the

24

Constitution, which vests this Court, and vests the

25

national courts with jurisdiction over all admiralty and

maritime cases, and the cases that are interpreted that

2

have all recognized that it is the function of this Court

3

and the function of all courts to apply a uniform general

maritime law, and that has a standing that the FELA does

5

not have.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WAGNER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

The FELA's a Federal statute -That's correct.
-- and it has to be interpreted

uniformly by the Federal and State courts that apply it,
is that not so?
MR. WAGNER:

11

But forum non conveniens is not

12

part of the FELA, whereas forum non conveniens is an

13

integral part of the general maritime law, and I might

14

assert one other thing.

15

focus on the language of the Jones Act in adopting -- in

16

adopting the standard of the FELA.

I think it's very important to

brief.

21

election, maintain an action for damages at law with a

1

One of those statutes which extends and modifies

2

the right of railway workers is section 1404 of the

3

Judicial Code, which is a Federal transfer statute, which

4

was passed explicitly by Congress to provide that FELA

5

cases would be transferable under the same standards that

6

had been judicially established under forum non

7

conveniens.

8

9

Missouri v. Mayfield did not address that issue,
it did not need to address that issue, because it was not

10

a Jones Act case.

11

admiralty law, and forum non conveniens as a part of the

12

admiralty law are fused and form part of the uniform law.

13

It should be applicable --

The Jones Act is a part of the

QUESTION:

I don't understand the point you're

15

making about 1404(a).

16

let's say it were brought in the Federal district court in

17

Louisiana, it's admiralty but the transfer mechanism would

18

be 1404 (a), right?

If this case were brought in - -

Unless it was to be transferred

QUESTION:

In that respect it's not different

from the FELA.
MR. WAGNER:

Well, it -- what I'm trying to

express is that there is a dual basis for the uniform

Except that Mayfield did not

concern itself 1) with the Jones Act, and 2) with the
general maritime law of the United States.
QUESTION:

11

That --

As I understand one part of what the

Jones Act takes from the FELA, if a plaintiff brings a

16
17
18

MR. WAGNER:

You can't remove it to Federal

The interpretation of this Court in

the Romero decision is that such a claim is nonremovable.
QUESTION:

All right, so doesn't that cut

19

against your argument that the Congress wanted to say,

20

"Plaintiff, you have a right to stay in the State court,

21

but State court, we're going to make you conform your

22

forum non conveniens doctrine to ours?"

23

that seems to me an inconsistency with a claim that's not

24

removable from the State court, Congress has made the

25

judgment that the suitor should be able to choose the

It's something

1

forum, and then say to the forum, State forum, but you

2

have to make yourself over to look more like what a

3

Federal court would - -

4

MR. WAGNER:

Yes, Your Honor, we think that's a

5

very important distinction, is that the nonremovability of

6

the Jones Act is something that is recognized, but this is

7

not affected by the ability to transfer this action from

8

one jurisdiction to another, and in fact Romero makes very

9

explicit that while causes of action in State court may be

10

maintained under the "savings to suitors" clause, there is

11

an overriding obligation of the State court to do the work

12

of admiralty, to be in admiralty court, to apply the

13

uniform general maritime law even though the defendant

14

cannot remove that -- cannot otherwise remove the action

15

that is otherwise removable.

16

QUESTION:

But isn't that --

17

QUESTION:

The Louisiana courts can't transfer

18

this case to Pennsylvania, can they?

19

have to dismiss it and let the plaintiff start anew in

20

Pennsylvania?

21

MR. WAGNER:

Wouldn't they simply

They would dismiss it, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, subject to certain guarantees protecting the

23

plaintiff's right to proceed, and that's in fact what the

24

district court did do after finding that Louisiana was a

25

patently inconvenient forum, and was forum-shopping of the

1

worst sort.
QUESTION:

2

So really, your procedures in State

3

court, you say the forum non conveniens doctrine has to be

4

applied uniformly, but whereas a Federal district court

5

can transfer it to another Federal district, a State trial

6

court can't transfer it to a court in another State.

7

has to go by a quite different procedure.
MR. WAGNER:

8
9

It

Well, Your Honor, by analogy, and

that's all I can answer, Mr. Chief Justice,

is by analogy,

10

is that between the jurisdictions within the State of

11

Louisiana,

the State court could transfer.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WAGNER:

14

QUESTION:

That's not what we have here.
That's correct.
No one is suggesting that it belonged

15

in Western Louisiana rather than Eastern Louisiana.

16

argument is it belonged in Pennsylvania, as I understand

17

it.

18

MR. WAGNER:

19

QUESTION:

The

That's right, Mr. Chief -Mr. Wagner, do you acknowledge that

20

there were sufficient minimum contacts here to meet the

21

due process clause requirements to sue in Louisiana?

22

MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor,

I do at this juncture.

23

We disputed that at the trial court and lost it.

24

personal views about that, but we have conceded that

25

point, and in fact, as a matter of general maritime law,

I have

forum non conveniens does not arise unless there is the

2

existence of personal jurisdiction, the very minimum

3

contacts Justice O'Connor referred to, and proper venue.
We concede those points for the sake of this

4
5
6

argument.
QUESTION:

You're converting discretionary

7

doctrine -- you just said that in order to get to the

8

forum non conveniens point, you must have personal

9

jurisdiction, there must be a place of proper venue, so

10

the Court is vested with authority to proceed, and I

11

thought that the whole idea of forum non conveniens was,

12

but there are -- but it isn't a compulsory doctrine.

13

That is, although we have authority to proceed,

14

we ought not, because there's some place better where this

15

can go forward, but the whole doctrine seems to be just

16

infused with discretion rather than compulsion, which is

17

what you seem to be making of it.

18

MR. WAGNER:

Your Honor, I -- I want its

19

application.

20

compulsory, but the doctrine itself, the heart and soul of

21

the doctrine, the issue, the aspect of the doctrine that

22

makes it so valuable, is its discretionary function in the

23

trial judge.

25

We request that its application be

1

fair forum for these litigants to try the cases, and the

2

aspect of its discretionary function is why it serves the

3

admiralty, and by that I mean, plaintiffs and defendants.

4

QUESTION:

But Justice Ginsburg's point is that

5

when you have discretion that broad, different trial

6

judges are going to come to different results, widely

7

different results on the basis of the same facts, exactly

8

what discretion is all about.

9

You can't pretend that you're going to get

10

uniformity of result.

11

to argue that in the interest of uniformity we must have

12

everybody adopt this discretionary doctrine.

13

going to get uniformity.

14

Once you -- it's just contradictory

MR. WAGNER:

You're not

Justice Scalia, I agree with your

15

point, and I think it demonstrates I'm not being clear.

16

I'm not — we are not requesting uniformity of result.

17

That can't be done.

18

QUESTION:

What -Then it isn't worth anything to the

19

general maritime law, if you can't be sure you're going to

20

get the same results anyway.

21

MR. WAGNER:

You can never be sure you get the

22

same results in any trial.

What we're asking is

23

uniformity of the rule.

24

application of the doctrine, just like we take a set of

25

facts and we give them to one trier of fact and ask, is

1

there fault, is there causation?

2

the answer will be, but what I can be sure of is the

3

doctrine that defines what fault is, and that's what we're

4

asking.
QUESTION:

5

I cannot be sure what

The uniform rule which says that a

6

court can do anything it wants is a uniform rule, but it's

7

not very helpful.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, as I understand you, you're not

saying that the court can do anything it wants, you're

10

saying that if the facts are so extreme, as perhaps they

11

are in this case, that it would always be an abuse of

12

discretion to deny the motion, you ought to be entitled to

13

it in those extreme cases.

14

MR. WAGNER:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's right.
And to that extent, it's a uniform

rule.

17

MR. WAGNER:

That's right.

We're asking for a

18

rule that is subject to the discretion of the trial court,

19

overturnable by abuse of discretion.
QUESTION:

20

And that'll be very rare.

Let me ask

21

you why you think uniformity is helpful, or needful in

this area.

as France and Louisiana, and as the supreme court of

Louisiana said in the Miller case, the doctrine of forum

it's not fair to say that forum non conveniens came from

American Dredging Company has also tried to

state that section 1404(a), which allows the transfer of a

I just wish to emphasize three points very

briefly.

Marine, maritime tort law is now a field dominated by

First, as this Court recognized in Miles v. Apex

10

Federal statute, and this Court has looked repeatedly to

11

the Jones Act in defining the tort remedies available to a

12

maritime employee like respondent.

13

The Jones Act, in turn, incorporates by

14

reference the rights and remedies given to railway workers

15

under the FELA. and this Court has repeatedly looked to

16

FELA precedents in defining the scope of remedies

17

available under the Jones Act.

18

highly relevant in this context, because there the Court

19

held that under the FELA State courts are free to apply

20

their own doctrine of forum non conveniens in FELA cases.

21

Thus, the Mayfield case is

That -- the Court said that the State courts are

22

free to accept or reject the doctrine of forum non

conveniens in those cases.

24

relevant here, and we believe that it disposes of the case

25

unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure claims.
QUESTION:

Mr. Manning, would you address the

forum party situation, please?
MR. MANNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

The United

5

States does not take a position on whether the doctrine of

6

forum non conveniens would be available -- would be a

7

preemptive doctrine of Federal law in State courts, where

8

foreign parties and events are involved.

9

however, that the United States urges this Court to leave

10
11

I would note,

that question open.
We believe that the considerations in such cases

12

may well be different, for two reasons.

13

foreign parties and events are involved, there may be, in

14

addition to the considerations relied on by petitioner,

15

considerations involving comity and reciprocity that

16

implicate greater Federal interests.

17

First, where

Secondly, in the admiralty cases that have

18

defined the doctrine of forum non conveniens going back to

19

Willendson v. Forsoket in 1801 and the Ship Lerow in 1804,

20

the doctrine was traditionally articulated in terms of its

21

effect on foreign parties.

22

we have jurisdiction over this case.

23

the trial court has discretion to decline to hear the case

24

because foreign parties are involved.

The source of the forum non conveniens argument being

presented in this case has a different source than the

MR. MANNING:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

question is whether -- is the Federal interest in the

are involved.

Is it fair to say -- you're saying

that there are two different forum non conveniens

that question.
QUESTION:

You reserve two questions, one is

whether, when you're in a State court but the defendants

are from abroad, that forum non conveniens might have a

Federal flavor?

6

MR. MANNING:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

That's correct.

For --no matter what the character

of the case, equity law, or admiralty?
MR. MANNING:

Well, Your Honor, it might be

10

different in admiralty cases, because there is a tradition

11

of admiralty preemption that emanates from Article III.

12

That tradition might not be available when you deal with

13

other forms of civil litigation.

14

There's a tradition, Jensen v. Southern Pacific

15

and so forth, of this Court's finding preemptive force of

16

admiralty law and admiralty cases in State court, so it

17

may be a different answer for admiralty cases.

18

we're simply asking the Court to leave that --

19

QUESTION:

Again,

What do you make of the

20

nonremovability of these claims, because if the Federal --

21

if Congress wanted to give effect to the Federal policy,

22

it could do that very easily simply by making these cases

significant, and in the domestic context we would note

2

that the Jones Act has a venue provision that applies, as

3

this Court has held, only in Federal court.
In fact, this Court has said that under the

4
5

Jones Act the presumption that State courts are entitled

6

to control - - that States are entitled to control the

7

dockets of their own courts was left undisturbed by

8

Congress, and we think that is also highly relevant in

9

addressing the forum non conveniens question, because it

10

shows that Congress believed that matters of State court

11

forum selection were matters for the court -- were matters

12

for the States when it enacted the Jones Act.

considered whether there was an interest on the part of a

kind of dispute that a foreign -- that the foreign country

would want resolved by the question --by the courts of

this Nation.

Sometimes what would happen is the court would

consult the consul of that foreign country and get in a

sense approval before it would proceed with the case, and

QUESTION:

But if it's a Jones Act case, then

we're talking about U.S. substantive law applying.
MR. MANNING:

That's right, Your Honor, and that

11

goes to the question of choice of law, which as counsel

12

for respondent indicated depends in part on the flag of

13

the vessel, the nationality of the seaman, the nationality

14

of the shipowner —

QUESTION:

If it weren't in the U.S. interest,

16

if this were a totally foreign situation, the Jones Act

17

wouldn't apply.

18

MR. MANNING:

It's very likely that the Jones

19

Act would not apply, and the cases which would suggest

20

that are Romero and Lauritsen v. Larson, which are cited

21

in our brief.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2

MR. WAGNER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

I'd like to address a number of the points that

4

were raised, but I don't think any one is more important

5

than the question whether or not there should be a

6

different rule for one set of litigants as for another

7

set.

8

I think the whole concept of a uniform general

9

maritime law grows out of the recognition that in order to

10

promote maritime commerce a single, expected system should

11

be identified.

12

that the lower courts have consistently applied to both

13

national claimants and local claimants and international

14

claimants and fragment it, and say, well, Mr. Plaintiff

15

from Bermuda, you can have a forum non conveniens

16

doctrine, or Mr. Defendant from America, you can or you

17

cannot, is to harken back to the very kind of dichotomy,

18

the very kind of local protectionism, that I submit was

19

the reason the admiralty law was recognized --

20

To take this rule of forum non conveniens

QUESTION:

Mr. Wagner, you would have no case,

21

would you, if this plaintiff came from Mississippi instead

22

of Louisiana?

MR. WAGNER:
of Mississippi?

If he came from Louisiana instead

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Louisiana -- I'm sorry.

Yes, Your Honor, I would have no

case whatsoever, and that's exactly my point.

This is all about the distance that

this man lives, and he lives inside Mississippi instead of

5

Louisiana.

7

If he lived across the border you would have

MR. WAGNER:

I would have no case, but I

respectfully disagree that it's just about that.

It's

about what's a fundamentally fair way to try a dispute

10

between the parties without inviting the parties to

have - -

12

QUESTION:

All that changes if he moved -- how

13

many miles would he have to move to be inside the

14

Louisiana borders?

15

MR. WAGNER:

Maybe 60 miles, Your Honor, but the

16

whole point -- what changes, Your Honor, is we have taken

17

away the power of the trial judge to decide what's fair

18

and what's not fair.

19

In this very same court, the Civil District

20

Court for the Parish of Orleans, in Markozannes v. Bermuda

21

Starline, applying this very same statute, the Louisiana

22

supreme court held that the trial court must hear a case,

23

a Jones Act case, by a Greek seaman sailing a Panamanian

24

vessel between Bermuda and Boston.

25

So it's not merely the distance, Your Honor.

respectfully submit it is the power of the trial judge to

decide what's fair, what's proper.

extensive forum shopping and vexatious litigation.

The Government suggests that the last

situation you describe could be handled by leaving open

the possibility of a separate rule for cases where you

8

have foreign defendants or plaintiffs.

9

Would you like half a loaf rather than none?

10
11

What do you think?
Is there

something wrong with that proposal?
MR. WAGNER:

There's something terribly wrong in

12

principle with that, and that is, it's the anathema of the

13

general maritime law, and how do we divide that?

14

American defendant get the nod over the foreign plaintiff?

15

Does the American plaintiff get the nod over the foreign

16

defendant, and how foreign?

Does the

The whole beauty -- beauty, the mastery of forum

18

non conveniens is, is that it is discretionary.

19

in the power of the trial judge, the person who will have

20

to decide what's convenient.

21

It puts

In Markozannes we had doctors testifying from

inconvenient forum, and like the Federal system I will

trial judge the ability, discretionary, to say, this is a

It complements this broad, broad breadth of

fair forum.
It accords the plaintiff an appropriate

11
12

deference to his or her original selection.

That is

13

entitled to great weight, and it ensures -- it ensures

14

that the alternate forum will have a suitable remedy, and

15

then it weighs the questions of what's a convenient way to

16

try this case, the convenience of the parties, the

17

witnesses.
In fact, I need to make this fundamental point

19

clear.

In admiralty, this has never been a question of

20

what the Solicitor General has called judicial

21

housekeeping, or docket control.

22

nonmarine setting, but in admiralty, it services the broad

23

breadth of that jurisdiction, makes it effective, and

makes it fair, and I respectfully submit that on that

basis the decision of the Louisiana supreme court should
