ORAL ARGUMENT OF MONICA FOSTER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FOSTER:

8

9

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Thomas Schiro was acquitted of mens rea murder

10
11

at the guilt trial.

12

penalty trial where the jury unanimously recommended

13

against the death penalty in 61 minutes.

14

QUESTION:

The case then proceeded to the

You refer to it as the guilt trial

15

and the penalty.

It's more generally spoken of as the

16

guilt phase and the penalty phase.

MS. FOSTER:

makes any difference.

Is there any

No, Your Honor, I don't think it

Now, you began by saying that he was

Yes, Justice Kennedy, and I'm

getting to that.

All right.

recommendation, but more importantly in our case, the

guilt trial verdict and imposed the death penalty, finding

that Sc.hiro had committed mens rea murder during the

course of a rape.
We know that Schiro was acquitted of mens rea

murder for four reasons.

Those reasons depend largely

7

upon the three separate charges filed in this case and the

8

verdict forms that the jury had received.

The -QUESTION:

Now, Ms. Foster,

I thought the jury

22

was instructed in instruction 8 that regardless of the

23

form of verdict, in any case the jury had to find that the

24

defendant engaged in the conduct which caused the death,

25

and that when the defendant did so he knew the conduct

was the instruction given, among others.

MS. FOSTER:

Justice -- Justice O'Connor, that

instruction goes to count I only.
QUESTION:

I thought that

It does not apply --

Then it is not so limited.

Was

instruction 8 given to the jury or not?

7

MS. FOSTER:

8

QUESTION:

Yes, absolutely, it was.
And it appeared to be understood by

counsel for both the State and the defendant that intent
10

was required to be found in any of the forms of verdict,

11

and wasn't that so found?

12

MS. FOSTER:

13

QUESTION:

That -That was the arguments -- the

14

arguments made to the jury by -- both counsel indicated

15

that understanding, and it would certainly be consistent

16

with instruction 8, as I read it.

17

MS. FOSTER:

No, Your Honor, I would

18

respectfully disagree with that.

Final instruction number

1

4 told the jury what the separate elements for mens rea

20

murder were and what the elements for felony murder were.

21

Final instruction 8 clearly cannot -- it cannot apply to

22

the felony murder count because the jury was instructed in

23

final 4 that in order to sustain a conviction for felony

24

murder, the jury had to find an underlying felony.

25

yet final instruction 8, we see nothing in there that

And

1

requires the jury to find the underlying felony.

2

Additionally, final instruction 8 does on to say

3

if you find from your consideration of all of the evidence

4

that each of these propositions was proven and that the

5

defendant was not legally insane at the time, then you

6

should find him guilty.

7

to the count I mens rea murder only, and does not --

QUESTION:

That instruction simply applies

Well, at a -- at a bare minimum, you

would have to be concede that the courts below haven't

10

found to the contrary of what I said to you.

11

no finding in the courts below that the jury was

12

instructed as you argue, only from instruction 4 rather

13

than instruction 8 .

14
15
16

MS. FOSTER:

There's been

I'm sorry, I don't understand what

your question is.
QUESTION:

Well, I had asked you whether the

17

jury was given instruction 8 telling them they had to find

18

intent regardless, and I don't believe that any court

19

below has said that eight was inapplicable to the finding

20

under the form of verdict that was returned here.

21

think any of the lower courts have said that, have they?

22

MS. FOSTER:

I don't

No, no court has said that 8 was

23

inapplicable.

24

the -- to sustain a verdict for mens rea murder, as was

25

charged here, you have to show an intent to kill.

But the law in Indiana clearly is that

(800) FOR DEPO

To

1

sustain a guilty verdict for felony murder, there is no

2

necessity of showing an intent to kill.

3

QUESTION:

Additionally --

It just appeared that -- I mean, you

4

may be right under terms of State law.

It just appeared

5

that the judge instructed the jury that they had to do

6

that, for whatever reason.

7

MS. FOSTER:

8

instruction number 8.

too, the verdict forms talk in terms of "as charged in

11

12

forms when the court refers to "as charged in count II of

13

the information," count II did not charge an intent

14

element as to the killing.

15

QUESTION:

Clearly, count I did not

Is it true that counsel for the

16

State, as well as the defendant, thought that only one

17

form of verdict could be returned?

18

MS. FOSTER:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

No, absolutely not.
That was certainly mentioned in their

arguments to the jury, though, wasn't it?
MS. FOSTER:

The prosecutor's arguments and his

22

one verdict comments come at a point in the proceedings

23

where the prosecutor gets to get up a second time and

24

deliver his closing argument.

25

jury should return but one verdict in his initial closing

He did not argue that the

MS. FOSTER:

You weren't there.
Correct.

Getting back to your

question, Justice O'Connor,

that the jury should not find Schiro guilty of count

14

The comments made by the prosecutor would be

15

interpreted by a reasonable jury as saying you don't have

16

to find Schiro guilty on count III.

17

concedes that the criminal deviate conduct occurred after

18

death,

makes an interesting argument.

20

would be understood by the jury as indicating that it was

okay with the State if the jury did not return a verdict

complicated analysis, but isn't it true that the defense

8

Mr.

The defense counsel was arguing

that one verdict was the only proper number of verdicts

10

that should be returned in this case because he was

11

arguing for not guilty by reason of insanity.
Additionally, as this Court said in Donnelley v.

12

14

15

return back into this court.
As this Court stated in Donnelley, we just can't

3

attribute the most damaging interpretation to ambiguous

4

remarks, and I think that what -- clearly what the

5

prosecutor is saying is you don't have to return a guilty

6

verdict on each count.

7

The prosecutor conceded count III.

We know that Schiro was acquitted of mens rea

8

murder for four reasons.

First of all, this jury had an

9

unimpeded opportunity to convict Schiro.

This jury was

10

given separate verdict forms -- separate guilty verdict

11

forms on each of the separately charged counts of murder.

12

The jury signed and returned only that count which

13

applied -- which found Schiro guilty of count II, and did

14

not sign the mens rea murder form or the felony murder

15

during a criminal deviate conduct.

16

QUESTION:

Well, why does that mean that he was

17

acquitted on those charges?

18

verdict on them.

19

MS. FOSTER:

Granted, the jury returned no

Because, as this Court's precedents

20

in Price and Green establish, a silent verdict is the

21

constitutional equivalent of an acquittal if either the

22

jury had the opportunity to convict and did not or because

23

the jury intended to acquit and --

QUESTION:

Ms. Foster, are you confusing --

1

Both Price and Green involved lesser included offenses,

2

did they not?

3

MS. FOSTER:

I think it's fair to say that it's

4

questionable whether the offenses at issue in Green

5

concerned lesser included offenses.

6

Court says that an -- an argument is made that these are

7

not lesser and greater offenses, although admitted the

8

lower courts had found that they were.

9

In footnote 14, the

But this Court stated that it doesn't matter

10

whether they're lesser or greater offenses, because the

11

fact of the matter is when we look at double jeopardy

12

principles, a defendant has an interest in having his case

13

resolved by the first jury impaneled to hear it.

14

the jury is given an opportunity to convict and does not,

15

it does not matter whether they're lesser or greater

16

offenses.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. FOSTER:

And if

That's what the Court said in Green?
The Court said in footnote 14

19

specifically that the argument -- that the offenses at

20

issue were not -- lesser or greater did not assist the

21

Government's position at all.

different offenses, that Green's position would, in fact,

be stronger.

there would have been no acquittal.

MS. FOSTER:

QUESTION:

The State can't have

That's exactly correct.
So that putting a person in jeopardy

is not the same -- I mean, you can put a person in

14

the jury acquitted him of it.

He was put in jeopardy, so he can't be

MS. FOSTER:

15

Why isn't that what

Well, I think Green says that if

16

the jury has the opportunity to convict and does not, that

17

that is treated the same as an acquittal.

18

QUESTION:

But if --

It's treated the same in the sense

19

that you can't try the person for that crime again, but

20

it's not the equivalent of an acquittal, which is the

21

determination of an issue.
MS. FOSTER:

22

I'm -- I think I would disagree

23

with that.

I think that it is treated the same as an

24

acquittal.

I think the Court said that when a verdict --

when a jury is silent after they have had either the

is it not, that that's double jeopardy?

we would call in Indiana felony murder, is that what

2

you're saying?

3

QUESTION:

4

M3. FOSTER:

Right.
Okay.

Yes, that would be double

jeopardy, because the rape is a lesser included of the

felony murder rape.

that we're talking about different proceedings here.
QUESTION:

8

I'm assuming by your hypothetical

Suppose it isn't a felony murder.

Suppose it's 10

MS. FOSTER:

11

QUESTION:

Intentional.
Suppose it's intentional murder, but

12

what is shown at the sentencing phase is that rape was

13

part of the -- of the event.

14

MS. FOSTER:

Well, if he's subsequently charged

15

with intentional murder then, no, I don't think there

16

would be a double jeopardy problem there.

QUESTION:

That's right.
No, there's no double -But rape as an aggravator.

You would

very different than being acquitted.

12

13

Yes.

Yes, it is.

Yes, Justice Scalia,

it is.
QUESTION:

16

Is that right.

It's okay to be

17

convicted twice but not to be acquitted and then

18

convicted?
MS. FOSTER:

19

In the hypothetical that you've

20

given me, he is convicted of two different things.

21

and intentional murder are not the same offense.

22

it would be okay for him to be convicted of both of those

23

things.

25

QUESTION:

So, yes,

Well, then you're talking about

collateral estoppel, not double jeopardy.

I think if you're going to say double jeopardy,

But you don't take that

Well, if the -- if the elements of

the intentional murder are different than the elements of

9

the rape, then no.
QUESTION:

10
11

It's a question of a second trial for

this -- for the same facts.
QUESTION:

12

We're talking about the sentencing

13

phase.

14

the elements no longer make a difference when you're just

15

talking about; the sentencing phase.

16

phase, they're trying to introduce the proof of a rape.

17

It -- the elements of that proof at the sentencing phase

18

are the same as the elements of the rape that he's been

19

convicted of.

20

Your case separates out the sentencing phase, and

In the sentencing

I don't -- I don't see why you wouldn't --

if you believe in double jeopardy, you would have to say,

21

no, that rape could not be introduced in the sentencing

22

phase.

MS. FOSTER:

I think that the element -- the

24

elements do make a difference.

QUESTION:

Ms. Foster, did you check in those

8

cases whether there was the kind of instruction that was

9

involved in instruction 8, where the jury was told for

10

murder -- seemed to think that murder, without defining

11

felony murder, premeditated, that all of them required an

12

intent, or where the prosecutor and defense counsel says

13

pick one?

14

In those cases that you cite in that footnote,

15

did we have chat kind of presentation to the jury where

16

counsel says pick one and the judge gives the same charge

17

for -- without differentiating?

18

judge discreetly say this is what's required for felony

19

murder, this is what's required for premeditated murder,

20

and did the attorneys in their summation make clear that

21

the jury could find more than one?

MS. FOSTER:

That instruction was not given

In 22 of those cases, the jury was given no

And what we

beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should return a guilty

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ABEL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The petitioner's claims in this case fail for
each of the four following reasons.

First, whatever else

is clear about the record in this case, it is clear that
it does not show an actual determination on the issue of
intent in petitioner's favor, which is a necessary
requirement because this is really a collateral estoppel,
rather than a double jeopardy claim.

It is most certainly a requirement

There are other issues that come up

Yes.

But you don't -- don't have

7

to -- if you decided the case in double jeopardy, you

8

don't have to have specific findings.

9

MR. ABEL:

In many double jeopardy cases you

10

would not.

11

doctrine would not apply where you've got multiple charges

12

of the same offense, we believe that if this were viewed

13

as a double jeopardy case, he still would have to, at a

14

minimum, show that the jury intended to acquit him.

15

And for -- because the implied acquittal

QUESTION:

May I ask, before you go on to your

16

other three, if the first one, there had been an explicit

17

finding by the jury of not guilty on the intentional

18

murder count, would you still prevail?

19

MR. ABEL:

Under the double jeopardy clause,

20

that's correct.

21

which is that double jeopardy deals with successive

22

prosecutions; it does not deal with the relationship

23

between different stages of a single capital trial.

24

might be other things in the Constitution that would

25

prevent that result, but certainly it would not be either

And that is, indeed, the third point,

There

3

And the fourth point is --

4

QUESTION:

What was your second?

MR. ABEL:

I'm sorry.

5

You skipped to

the third.

6

The second point was that

7

the implied acquittal doctrine simply does not apply where

8

the multiple counts are alternative theories of proving

9

what is the same offense, as they were in this case.
QUESTION:

10
11

What do you say about footnote 14

that she relies so heavily on?
MR. ABEL:

12

Well, I think it's important to look

at.

greater, but the court went on to say it is vital that it

15

is a distinct and different offense.

16

have that here, because on -- under State law, under the

17

common law, and under the law of most American

18

jurisdictions, felony murder and murder are not separate

19

offenses; they are part of a unified offense, and this

20

Court recognized that in the Schad case.

21

The court said what's not important is lesser or

And you simply don't

And the fourth point is that to apply double

22

jeopardy or collateral estoppel in the manner that

23

petitioner suggests would be to create a new rule and to

24

apply it retroactively in a habeas corpus case, which this

25

Court has held time and again is not appropriate.

Before I amplify on those points, however, I do

1

2

want to correct what I believe may have been a

3

misimpression about Indiana practice with respect to jury

4

instructions, because the practice has changed over time.

5

At the time of this trial it was inappropriate under

6

Indiana law -- and there were several Indiana Supreme

7

Court cases indicating that instructions were not to go to

8

the jury room.

9

Over time that practice evolved.

The Indiana

10

Supreme Court began saying, well, it's okay to send them

11

to the jury room, or at least it's not error.

12

current state of the law is that it's the better practice

13

to send them to the jury room.

There were 3 sheets of paper that contained the total of

6

forms.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish Price and

Green on the implied acquittal theory?
MR. ABEL:

Well, because, as the Court

7

recognized in Green, the vital thing is that you have a

8

distinct and different offense involved, and felony murder

9

and murder simply are not.

In addition, on this record it

10

is a requisite for the application of Price and Green that

11

the jury has a full opportunity to convict, and in this

12

context opportunity to convict has to mean that the jury

13

had an opportunity to convict on all of the counts.

14

Because, as I believe in one of the answers to

15

one of the questions earlier, had they convicted on the --

16

on count I but been silent on counts II and III, then we

17

would be here arguing over whether they had acquitted him

18

of the felony.

19

And the only case that we've been able to locate

20

that addresses this specific issue is a case from the New

21

York Court of Appeals, People v. Jackson,

22

in that case was told -- the charges were premeditated

23

murder and felony murder.

24

supposed to return one verdict.

25

of course, they followed that.

MR. ABEL:

That's correct.

And that is another

reason that the cases are distinguishable.

they're distinguishable for at least three different

12

It's important to look at the nature of the

13

claim here, and I think when that is done it becomes clear

14

that it is not a pure double jeopardy claim, but rather it

15

is a collateral estoppel claim in the mode of Ashe v.

Swenson and that line of cases.

precludes is a subsequent prosecution for an entire

7

In one instance, the whole claim

That is important for this case for a number of

8

reasons, because if the record in this case shows

anything, it shows that the petitioner has failed to

establish a jury determination on the issue of intent in

his favor.

14

The Court's cases are very that this

All the way from Ashe v. Swenson, which adopted

15

collateral estoppel, to Dowling v. United States, one of

16

the Court's more recent cases on the issue, the Court has

17

made plain that the defendant must show that there is no

18

other possible explanation for the verdict.

19

that is a paraphrase, if you will, of Dowling.

20

I believe --

Here, of course, there are a number of possible

21

other explanations.

But in analyzing whether there was an

to look at two things.

Mr. Abel, this whole problem would

And so Ashe v. Swenson simply doesn't govern

If I may explain, I believe that a

doctrine that the Court could develop in an appropriate

2

simply not aimed at anything but successive prosecutions.

So I'm not suggesting that there wouldn't be

In terms of the implied acquittal rule of Price
