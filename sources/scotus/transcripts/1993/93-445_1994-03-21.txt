ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LEWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
These two criminal cases, joined here on

12

certiorari to the Fourth Circuit, present a single issue

13

of statutory construction.

14

Congress, in enacting the Firearm Owners' Protection Act

15

of 1986, bar individuals who have been convicted of

16

felonies in Federal courts from possessing firearms even

17

though State law permits them once again to vote, to sit

18

on a jury, or to hold public office?

Does the language used by

19

The Government acknowledges that if a State

20

conviction were involved -- indeed, in the Jones case

21

there are two State convictions as well as a Federal

22

conviction -- the restoration of the felon's rights

23

entitles him to own a gun under Federal law.

24

The contested issue is only whether the

25

restoration of rights can affect a Federal conviction, and

1

of course, we begin, as the Court does in so many of these

2

cases, including the entire sequence of Gun Control Act

3

cases which ended with the Dickerson case that led to the

4

Firearm Owners' Protection Act, with the language of the

5

statute, and if the Court will permit me, I would like to

6

address the Court's attention to the very specific words

7

of this statute, and they appear at the bottom of page 2

8

and the top of page 3 of our brief.

9

Section 921(a)(20) of title 18 defines what is a

10

crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1

11

year, and the first point is that it's interesting that

12

that statute, in subsection (A) and subsection (B), makes

13

specific reference to Federal or State offenses in

14

subsection (A), and to any State offense in subsection

15

(B), and from that I believe it is clear that Congress,

16

when it was trying to distinguish or state anything with

17

regard to this area of the law that could in some way

18

distinguish between Federal and State offenses, knew that

19

those words could be inserted in the statute, and it did

20

so.

21

But then the statute goes on with the language

22

which Congress added in 1986 following this Court's

23

decision in Dickerson, and quite frankly to overrule this

24

Court's decision in Dickerson, and the first sentence

25

states that the conviction of a crime is to be determined

1

in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which

2

the proceedings were held.

3

In other words, how one defines what is a

4

conviction is to be determined not as a matter of Federal

5

law, which this Court said was the rule in Dickerson --

6

and that was, by the way, the Court unanimously.

7

Chief Justice in his dissenting opinion agreed that it was

8

a matter of Federal law -- and Congress said no, you're to

9

look to State law to determine whether it is or is not a

10

Even the

conviction.
But beyond that, Congress went on with very

11
12

specific language.

13

not any State conviction, but any conviction -- which has

14

been expunged or set aside, or for which a person has been

15

pardoned or has had civil rights restored, and it's

16

interesting, if one looks at that language, that what

17

Congress has done, it has really divided these four

18

classes of postconviction actions into really two groups.

19

They said, any conviction -- again,

One is a conviction which has been expunged or

20

set aside.

In other words, where the court itself, or the

21

sovereign itself has expunged the conviction, or by appeal

22

or some other manner the conviction has been set aside,

23

and then Congress went on to say, for which a person has

24

been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.

25

did not say, any conviction that has been nullified by

Congress

1

2

pardon or by a restoration of rights.
The second half of this provision, it spoke to

3

the person, and it said, one looks to see whether the

4

person has been pardoned, and whether he has had his civil

5

rights restored, and that, to us, is plain language that

6

demonstrates that if you look at the defendants, like

7

Messrs. Jones and Beecham in this case, and you're to

8

consider whether they, as they stand at the time that they

9

are found with a weapon in their possession have had their

10
11

civil rights restored.
QUESTION:

It is true, Mr. Lewin, that all of

12

the other three means of making the conviction not count

13

are means that can only be employed by the same

14

jurisdiction that entered the conviction, only that

15

jurisdiction can expunge, only that jurisdiction can set

16

aside, and only that jurisdiction can pardon.

17

State could not, or some other jurisdiction.

18

Some other

Doesn't that lead you to think that when it

19

says, or has had civil rights restored, it again is

20

referring to the same jurisdiction?

21

MR. LEWIN:

I think not, Justice Scalia, and the

22

reason why not is because the matters that the first three

23

relate to are all things which are done by the sovereign

24

which causes the conviction in the first place.

25

conviction expunged, the conviction set aside, or

Taking away civil rights -- and I think this is

the Government's basic error, when they speak about the

status of a conviction.

not done by the sovereign or the statute which a felony

6

offender has violated.

7

that another law, a State law.

8

QUESTION:

9

Taking away one's civil rights is

It is following his conviction

Mr. Lewin, which one?

Suppose the

defendant is a resident of State X, but the convictions

10

are in State Y, and State Y would not provide for

11

restoration of civil rights, but State X, where the

12

defendant has always lived, and lives after imprisonment,

13

would.

14

Which one?
MR. LEWIN:

We think that a literal reading of

15

the statute means that State X can be applied, the law of

16

State X, and if he then has his rights restored, then he

17

qualifies under this statute.

18

Now, the Government points out, and it's true --

QUESTION:

MR. LEWIN:

sorry.

If he is in State X.

That's --

If he lives in State X.

Yes, I'm

That's what I understood.

MR. LEWIN:

QUESTION:

No.
I don't know why Nevada couldn't pass

5

a law that says, we think all convicted criminals who have

served their debt to society should be treated like any

other free citizen, and that's the law of Nevada.

Yes, Justice Stevens, if he lived in

But he doesn't get his rights restored --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LEWIN:

Why does he have to live in Nevada?
Well, because the only way you get

14

practically your rights restored is if you go to vote, and

15

you're permitted to vote, you go to be a juror, and you're

16

permitted to be on a jury --

QUESTION:

18

MR. LEWIN:

19

Apply for a driver's license.
Well, driver's licenses -- felons

are not deprived of driver's licenses.
But the point is, Justice Stevens, that

20
21

restoration means -- is the kind of thing which your local

22

law, where you live, takes it away from you, and then it

23

restores it to you.

of these rights while you're in prison, but after you

serve the sentence, they're automatically restored and

you're treated like a free citizen --

MR. LEWIN:

5

QUESTION:

-- that would do it, under your

Well, to that extent, Justice

6

7

Well -- yes.

reading.

8

Stevens, our position really is that if, to the extent

9

that the State of conviction would restore his rights, and

10

he's been in prison during that period of time, there

11

would also be a restoration of rights.

12

In answer to Justice Ginsburg's question --

13

QUESTION:

Oh, but our -- both Justice Ginsburg

14

and I are concerned about the case in which the conviction

15

is in New York and the gentleman is now in Nevada.

QUESTION:

Yes.

about former convicts.

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Why do they have to live -- oh, they

have to live in Nevada because otherwise they would have

no rights there.

1

haven't had my rights restored in the State of Wyoming

2

because I've never been in the State of Wyoming.

3

QUESTION:

If you had -- you were living in

4

Wyoming, say, after you got out of prison, then you could

5

move to any other State and it wouldn't matter what those

6

laws were.

7

where the effect of a judgment, either of a Federal

8

judgment or a judgment of State B, is determined by the

9

law of State X?

10

Can you give me any other example, Mr. Lewin,

That is, you're taking a Federal judgment -- the

11

Federal conviction in Beecham, Federal judgment in

12

Jones -- and you're saying, the effect of that judgment is

13

determined by the law of another State.

14

Full faith and credit is usually -- the

15

accoutrements of a judgment are determined by the place in

16

which the judgment is rendered, right?

17

MR. LEWIN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
That's the ordinary rule.

So this

19

would be an extraordinary rule, and I was trying to think

20

of an analogy, and I couldn't.

21

MR. LEWIN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of all

22

it's not the effect of the judgment.

23

understood, it's the effect of State law on somebody who

24

has had a Federal judgment.

you may not vote after you've been convicted of that

offense.

Nevada, if the State of Nevada says, now you may not vote

from you.

There's nothing in the Federal statute,

It's only because you live in the State of

So it's

But in answer to your direct question, I think

10

we found --we hadn't cited it in the brief because we

11

found it over the weekend, really, but there is a

12

provision in Federal 28 U.S.C. which provides that Federal

13

jurors are eligible -- it certainly lists as to when

14

they're ineligible, if they can't read or write English

15

and so on, but then it says, if they have a charge pending

16

against them for the commission in a State or Federal

17

court of record of a crime punishable by imprisonment for

18

more than 1 year, and his civil rights have not been

19

restored.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LEWIN:

What section is that?
That's section 1865 of 28 U.S.C. --

22

and I submit, Justice Ginsburg, that if you were to

23

consider somebody being called for Federal jury service in

24

the State of Nevada who 20 years ago had a felony

25

conviction in the State of New York, and then he lives in

the State of Nevada, and the question is, does he qualify

2

for Federal jury service, and I submit that under this

3

statute, if the State of Nevada said, your rights have

4

been restored for Federal felonies no matter where they've

5

been committed, that person will be permitted to serve on

6

a Federal jury in the State of Nevada, and if that's

7

true -QUESTION:

court has held that.

10

MR. LEWIN:

11

14

No, I agree, there's been no

decision along that line, Justice Stevens.

12

13

Well, you're submitting that, but no

QUESTION:

It's really the same issue we have in

MR. LEWIN:

I should have prefaced my response

this case.

15

to Justice Ginsburg by saying that I don't think that

16

question has to be reached in this case, by the way,

17

because this is not a case involving somebody who has

18

moved from State A to State B.

19

Even if it were true -- even if it were true

20

that one has to look to the State of conviction -- and let

21

me say, the Government cites cases where courts have sort

22

of in passing -- the question has not really been decided,

23

has not been litigated in the courts of appeals, but we

24

acknowledge that in passing and just looking at the

25

statute, many courts of appeals have said well, we look to

1

the State of conviction to see whether they restore

2

rights.
There's something maybe instinctive, maybe along

3
4

the lines of what you said, Justice Ginsburg, on the part

5

of courts to say well, let's look at the State of

6

conviction.

7

QUESTION:

Or look at the Federal system,

8

because in Beecham's case you have only the Federal

9

conviction, isn't that right?
MR. LEWIN:

10
11

convictions, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, Mr. Beecham had earlier State
They're not in the record.

Then take a case where there is

14

MR. LEWIN:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
Only a Federal conviction.

You would

16

still say, if that person lives in a State that restores

17

civil rights immediately on release from prison, that the

18

effect of that Federal judgment will be determined by the

19

State, by the State's law on restoration, so the Federal

20

judgment is in some respect diminished.

21

as dire a consequence for the defendant as it would if you

22

didn't have the State law.

MR. LEWIN:

It doesn't have

had a felony conviction, we will impose no disability on

2

anybody who's had a Federal conviction.

3

there's no disability that is ever imposed by the Federal

4

statute.

5

If there's true,

The only reason any disability is imposed that

6

ends up being subsequently restored is because there is a

State law, so it's not -- it doesn't make sense to speak

of the disability imposed by the Federal conviction.

MR. LEWIN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LEWIN:

Yes.
Your theory works just the same way.
Yes, and indeed, in the Beecham

16

case, the interesting thing is that in this case, in the

17

Beecham case, in fact, the Court looked to the State of

18

conviction to see what Tennessee law was.

19

Court thought was significant.

20

Mr. Jones had

1

restores all his rights, therefore we're assuming that his

2

rights have been restored, but it's still a Federal

3

conviction, but they did not look to the law of Ohio, so

4

it's clear to us this is an open question.

5

We think really it's an issue that this Court

6

doesn't have to decide in this case as to whether the law

7

of residence -- the law of the State of residence or the

8

law of the State of conviction controls.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, you assume that there has

10

to be some way in which this provision "or has had civil

11

rights restored" applies to a Federal conviction, but why

12

do I have to assume that that particular one applies to a

13

Federal conviction?

14

Surely I can envision a State that does not

15

accord its Governor any pardon power, and I would say,

16

well, in that State, any conviction would not have the

17

benefit of this provision or set-aside, or for which a

18

person has been pardoned, right, and I'd say, well, some

19

States don't have that.

20

That's okay.

Why can't I say, with respect to the Federal

21

Government, that provision applies to many States, maybe

22

most States, it just doesn't apply to the Federal

23

Government?

24
25

Isn't that a conceivable disposition of it?

MR. LEWIN:

I think if so, if Congress had

intended that in any way, I think Congress would have said

1

in the language of that statute that it refers only to

2

State convictions, or in the case of State convictions has

3

had civil rights restored, but otherwise, if Congress is

4

saying, a person has had civil rights restored, these are

5

two individuals who have had their civil rights restored.
QUESTION:

6

But it was -- Justice Scalia's

7

reading would make the second sentence compatible with the

8

first sentence, which the thrust of that seems to me that

9

the conviction, the judgment of conviction, is determined

10

by the law of the jurisdiction in which it was held.
MR. LEWIN:

11

I think the problem, Justice

12

Ginsburg, is that that reading and the Government's

13

reading makes the second sentence entirely superfluous.
If we are looking only to whether the conviction

14
15

still has the status of a conviction, it would have been

16

sufficient for Congress simply to have said the first

17

sentence:

18

shall be determined in accordance with the law of the

19

jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.

20

Therefore, if a conviction no longer has the status of a

21

conviction, whether it's by expungement or anything else,

22

it would be --

23

what constitutes a conviction of such a crime

QUESTION:

-- Mr. Lewin, because the prohibition

24

is on a person who's been convicted, so if he ever had a

25

conviction, he would be disentitled.

it was entered is no long effective so its status is no

MR. LEWIN:

On the other hand, my point is that

5

in this case there are various questions that this court

6

need not reach, the question of whether somebody who lives

7

in Nevada and may therefore own a rifle in Nevada, and

8

then moves to a State which does not provide for

9

restoration of rights, and therefore his old New York

10

conviction again might prevent him from voting or serving

11

on a jury, could that person possess a rifle under Federal

12

firearms law?
I'm saying, it's another question.

13

I think read

14

literally, I think the statute would apply, but I could

15

see a court of appeals reaching that question and saying,

16

oh, no, just as with the Federal jury qualification, a

person might be qualified to be a juror in a Federal court

restore the rights, suddenly that right is taken away from

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DuMONT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:

9

The Government's construction of the language at

10

issue here is succinctly stated.

The status of any prior

11

conviction for purposes of the Federal Gun Control Act is

12

determined by reference to the law of the jurisdiction

13

that rendered the jurisdiction.

14

There are two basic propositions that I'd like

15

to focus on that we think make the case straightforward.

16

First, ours is the natural reading of the statute,

17

particularly in light of its background and purpose, and

18

second, our reading provides

19

easily administered rule.
QUESTION:

20

clear, textually bounded and

What would you say was the purpose,

21

Mr. DuMont?

One could certainly infer that the purpose

22

was to make sure that people in prisons didn't get guns,

23

but as soon as they got out, they could.

24

really quite a bath that Congress gave after our Dickerson

25

decision.

I mean, this was

1

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think it would be an

2

extraordinary reading to think that Congress intended that

3

anyone, once you got out of prison, could have had a gun,

4

because if they had intended that, they could have said

5

that much more simply.

6

take the state of pre-1986 law, pre-Dickerson law, which

7

was that Federal law determined the status of a State

8

criminal disposition no matter what it was, so that for

9

instance, in one of the famous cases, a State pardon,

What they did intend to do was to

10

which explicitly restored State firearms rights, was not

11

given effect for Federal law.

12

Now, Congress was reacting to that kind of

13

situation, and what they said about that was, look, if

14

we're relying on a State's conviction for purposes of

15

Federal law, we ought to defer to the State's

16

characterization of whether something was a conviction in

17

the first place -- that was Dickerson -- and also, any

18

subsequent action that a State might take, that a

rendering jurisdiction might take to attenuate the ongoing

20

effects of the conviction.

As that

1

MR. DuMONT:

We don't think so, Your Honor.

The

2

language is very similar, although not identical here, but

3

there has been no litigation on this point, first of all.

4

QUESTION:

No, but if there's no Federal statute

5

on the restoration of the rights, then how would one's

6

right to serve on a jury -- or, how would one's civil

7

rights be restored for purposes of serving on a jury if

8

not by reference to State law?

9

MR. DuMONT:

Well, there are two things I would

10

say in response to that.

11

the legislative history of the jury rights statute are

12

that Federal rights used to always depend on State law,

13

and in the 1940's when that statute was originally passed,

14

the explicit intention was to federalize the rules for

15

qualification to sit on a Federal jury.

16

First of all, the indications in

Now, when the statute was later amended in the

17

mid-seventies to change some of the language that relates

18

to this, again, the indications in the legislative history

19

are that what Congress had in mind, they refer

20

specifically to two Federal statutes which they had in

21

mind, both of which are not restoration statutes but in

22

fact expungement statutes, and I think there is also an

23

indication that pardons may have been in consideration.

24
25

So our position on this would be there's no
reason to read these two statutes differently, but the
31

SUITE 400

1

correct reading, in the absence of anything else in the

2

statute to guide us, is that the restoration of rights for

3

both statutes must be accorded by the jurisdiction that

4

rendered the conviction.

5

QUESTION:

But I think you're telling me that

6

they would be read differently, because I think you're

7

suggesting that restoration of civil rights under the jury

8

statute might be a restoration by pardon or expungement,

9

whereas it is clear from the text of the firearms statute

10

that restoration cannot be by pardon or expungement

11

because they're separately listed in the statute.

12

MR. DuMONT:

But that's why I say the language

13

is not identical, and I think some of the differences may

14

be relevant in the sense that I think the words, civil

15

rights restored, used in the jury qualification statute,

16

may be broader, because they're intended to sweep in a

17

Federal pardon, for instance, or the one instance that I'm

aware of where there's a possibility for expungement of

QUESTION:

Well, the Federal Government does not

take away any civil rights to begin with, does it?
MR. DuMONT:

Well, it depends largely on what

MR. DuMONT:

1

Under 1865.

There are a variety of

2

occupational disabilities for certain kinds of convictions

3

that have to do with serving on trust funds for pension

4

funds, serving in labor unions, this kind of thing.

5

There are some crimes which -- part of which the

6

penalty is, or may be, that you can't hold Federal office.

7

There are instances where civil rights are -QUESTION:

8

9

Well, do States eliminate that

disability -- those disabilities?
MR. DuMONT:

10

I'm aware of no instance under

11

which a State can eliminate one of those disabilities,

12

although the issue may be somewhat unclear under the labor

13

statutes.

14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well then, the State -- even the

State can't restore the civil rights, then.
MR. DuMONT:

Depending on whether you consider

those civil rights for purposes of this statute.
Now, it's true that in the case of State

19

convictions, which is -- I ought to emphasize, the vast

20

majority of the felony convictions we're talking about

21

that are covered here are State convictions, which is what

22

Congress had in mind.

23

the civil rights restoration language is fairly clear.

24
25

QUESTION:

For purposes of a State conviction,

Mr. DuMont, when Congress --we know

what it meant to do with that first sentence.

It meant to

1

overturn Dickerson, right, and the conviction is -- the

2

dimensions of the conviction are determined by the

3

jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.

4
5
6

MR. DuMONT:

It meant to overturn Dickerson for

convictions that were State convictions, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Then we get to the second sentence,

7

and everything except for restoration of rights is tied

8

into a particular jurisdiction, expunged, set aside, as

9

Justice Scalia pointed out before.

10

MR. DuMONT:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.
When a draft like this appears, is

12

there anybody minding the shop who would look at such a

13

sentence when this legislation is just on the

14

drawingboards, civil rights restored, and say, wait a

15

minute, that one doesn't fit, and maybe the Department of

16

Justice should call the attention of the congressional

17

committee to that misfit?

18

MR. DuMONT:

In general we do try to look at

19

pending legislation and point out whatever problems we can

20

identify with it.

I wasn't here when that particular

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

24

MR. DuMONT:

25

Not on my watch -- yes, right.

vetted by the Department of Justice.

QUESTION:

1

Maybe we should adopt a contra

2

preferentem mode of interpretation, and just at least when

3

it's in title 18, simply construe it against the

4

Department.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

7
8

9

It might induce more care in these

matters.
MR. DuMONT:

Well, I must say I don't think that

even if we focused purely on the language of the statute

10

that there's anything particularly unclear about it,

11

because if you look at the language of the statute and at

12

the legislative history, such as it is, which does not

13

address this particular point, but which does make clear

14

that what Congress was thinking about in response to

15

Dickerson was the Federal treatment of State

16

convictions --

17

QUESTION:

Well, how about Mr. Lewin's point

18

that sections (A) and (B) expressly modified the term,

19

offenses, by saying State, or Federal, or both, and then

20

this language after that just doesn't say anything?

21

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think there's a good reason

22

why subsections (A) and (B) distinguish Federal and State,

23

and that is that in (B) when we're talking about

24

distinguishing misdemeanors, really that's just getting at

25

the fact that Federal law had decided to get away from

2

defining these things as felonies.
This is traditionally referred to as a felon

3

with a firearm statute, but it doesn't really define it

4

that way, it defines it in terms of crimes punishable by

5

imprisonment for more than a year.

6

This -- (B) is really just intended to take care

7

of State cases, where States still use felony and

8

misdemeanor classifications, and therefore it's something

9

that only applies to a State.

10

Now, in the second two sentences, we would

11

submit that there's nothing narrowing about them that

12

prevents them from applying to both Federal and State

13

convictions, so there's nothing that was necessary to do

14

to distinguish that, but the fact is that that doesn't

15

mean that every part of the laundry list in the second

16

sentence that was added in 1986 -- pardons, expungements,

17

set-asides, or restorations.

18

As Justice Scalia pointed out earlier, not every

19

one of those has to apply to both Federal and State

20

convictions.

21

that there are some States that never restore rights, and

22

yet no one thinks that the restoration of rights language

23

doesn't apply to States because of that, and it may be

24

that the Federal Government simply does not provide a

25

restoration mechanism, but that doesn't mean that the

It's perfectly possible -- well, it is true

1

pardon, expungement, and set-aside terms don't apply

2

equally to Federal convictions.
QUESTION:

3

As a matter of policy, I can't

4

understand why the Federal -- I mean, if you're trying to

5

conceive of what the plausible intention of whoever wrote

6

this thing was, I find it hard to think why Congress would

7

say, well, so long as the State where he was convicted

8

says he can carry a gun, he can carry a gun anywhere, even

9

in those States that don't allow ex-felons to carry guns,

10
11

ever.

That's a strange disposition.
Whereas I -- it would make a lot of sense to

12

say, if the -- I'm not sure it should be the State of

13

residence, but if the State where he's acting, if the

14

State where he possesses the gun, or ships the gun, or

15

receives the gun, if they've said, you know, your civil

16

rights are restored, we don't care, we don't mind

17

felons -- ex-felons owning guns.

redemption.

19

shouldn't we interpret it that way --

So be it.

MR. DuMONT:

QUESTION:

We believe in

I can understand that.

Why

Well, I think --- on a State-by-State basis?

22

are the -- and that would make more sense from the

23

standpoint of the citizen knowing what the law is.

I

I read the New

They say, ex-felons -- you know.

Where

Why

1

shouldn't that be the way we interpret it, which isn't

2

residence.

3

It's not quite what the petitioner is saying.
MR. DuMONT:

I think the reason not to interpret

4

it that way, or as residents, or as the State where -- in

5

the case of a Federal conviction where the prior

6

conviction was rendered, the reason to avoid all those

7

readings is not that they might not make sense under some

8

statutory scheme, it's just that they're not what Congress

9

said when it wrote this statute.

10

Again, we would have two sentences here that

11

were added in 1986.

They are two sides of the same coin,

12

and they really address two halves of the same thought.

13

The thought was to give a rendering jurisdiction the power

14

to control what effect its convictions would be given for

15

purposes of the Federal firearms statute.

16

Now, the -- if you look at -- first of all the

17

first sentence explicitly ties in the disabilities here,

18

or the term conviction, to a State where -- or to the

19

jurisdiction where the conviction was rendered, and we see

20

no reason to read those two sentences separately.

21

think that logical connection ought to carry on through

22

interpretation of the second sentence.

We

23

Even if you look, as I take it my colleague

24

would have you look, at the second sentence simply by

25

itself, then again, as you pointed out earlier, Justice

1

Scalia, we have three things listed which can only be done

2

by the jurisdiction that has originally rendered the

3

conviction, and then we have a fourth thing.

4

know, noscitur a sociis, and the logical reading of that

5

fourth --

6

QUESTION:

Well, you

I don't know if it's correct to say

7

that only the jurisdiction which rendered the conviction

8

can set it aside.

9

It can be set aside on Federal habeas.

MR. DuMONT:

Well, as we acknowledge, that's a

10

possible colloquial exception.

11

correct, because technically a Federal habeas judgment

12

doesn't operate on the conviction, the State conviction,

13

it operates on the body of the accused, but one can see

14

that that might have been encompassed there.

15

Now, it's not technically

We think it would -- to read a lot into that

16

would be to let a very small tail wag a very large dog,

17

because the vast majority of set-asides are done as a

18

matter of State law, and by the way, you can see that even

19

more clearly if you think about the fact that if the

20

second sentence weren't there at all and there were no

21

explicit statutory reference to setting aside convictions,

22

we don't think anyone would suggest, and certainly we

23

would not suggest, that the Federal law could make use of

24

a State conviction for purposes of this statute that had

25

been invalidated on a Federal habeas.

I think the third thing to observe about the

1
2

language of the statute is that those two sentences are

3

tied in not only by their simultaneous enactment, and by

4

their adjacency in the text, but by the fact that they

5

both express two halves of one congressional purpose,

6

which, as we've said, is to give the States the power to

7

determine the existence, in the first instance, and the

8

continuing effects for purposes of this law of their own

9

criminal adjudication.
As the legislative history says, in the typical

10
11

case, the Federal conviction rests on a State predicate,

12

and therefore in those cases it makes sense to defer to

13

the State definition of whether that predicate exists or

14

not.

15

Now, the same logic -- the same logic extends to

16

Federal convictions simply by saying that if you have a

17

Federal conviction, then its existence and its continuing

18

effect for purposes of this law are a matter of Federal

19

law, and that, I will point out also, is the part of

20

Dickerson that was not overturned.

21

When Congress addressed Dickerson, it addressed

22

it in the sense of the broad number of cases which rely on

23

State law, but there was no indication that it meant to

24

disturb Dickerson's application to a Federal conviction

25

and the status of a Federal conviction under Federal law.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. DuMont, I noticed in your

2

briefing you don't rely to any extent as a background norm

3

on the full faith and credit principle, both article IV

4

and 1738, that says a judgment shall have the same full

5

faith and credit as it has in the jurisdiction of the

6

State from which it is taken.

7

If we're saying that these words -- the meaning

8

is not clear, then that is one general rule set by the

9

Constitution and implemented by statute that judgment is

10

to have the same full faith and credit every place as it

11

has in the jurisdiction where it's rendered.

12

MR. DuMONT:

Well, that's correct.

It's not

13

entirely clear to me what relevance the full faith and

14

credit rule has to Federal convictions, which are the

15

specific convictions we're dealing with here.

16

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think the Supremacy

17

Clause would require the same respect for a Federal

18

judgment that is required by the Full Faith and Credit

19

Clause for a State judgment?

20

MR. DuMONT:

One would hope so, although here, I

21

suppose the question is, Congress has spoken to defer a

22

State law in certain instances, and the question would be

23

whether this is one of those instances, but as a

24

background law, that is certainly correct that we think

25

the basic supposition ought to be that Congress would not

1

intend States to be determining the effect of a Federal

2

conviction for purposes of Federal law.

3

QUESTION:

What do you think the Congress'

4

reason was for saying that as to State convictions, if

5

they had been set aside, or there had been a pardon,

6

rights were restored, they would not count in deciding

7

eligibility to have a firearm, but the Federal conviction

8

shouldn't be treated that way?

9

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think Congress was

10

concerned that -- as far as I can tell, that in the case

11

of a State conviction where the State had taken some --

12

either did not regard the conviction as sufficiently

13

serious enough to see it as a conviction for purposes of

14

its own collateral consequence rules, or did regard it

15

so -- that way in the initial case, but then had made a

16

determination of some sort that the person's time had been

17

served or that for other reasons the collateral

18

consequences ought to be wiped off, that the Federal

19

Government ought to respect that determination in the

20

realm of firearms disabilities.

21

So that if you had a Tennessee felon who the

22

State of Tennessee had made a judgment was now competent

23

to carry guns, whether he had not been before, the Federal

24

Government ought to defer to that judgment, and I think

25

that's all they were trying to do.

QUESTION:

So -- but Federal convictions, since

2

there isn't any recognized mechanism for restoring civil

3

rights, that just would be with a person, and you could

4

never get out from under that.

5

MR. DuMONT:

Well, that's not entirely true.

6

Congress provided a very specific provision in section

7

925(c) for going to the Secretary of the Treasury, in the

8

case of a Federal conviction, and regaining Federal

9

firearms rights in the face of a Federal conviction, based

10

on the same sorts of judgments about rehabilitation and

11

good character.

12

14

There's always also the possibility of a
presidential pardon.

Is it your position that the

restoration of any civil right is enough?

they restore some but not all?

Well, that's in the statute,

4

MR. DuMONT:

5

I'd just like to dwell briefly on the fact that

6

our rule, as I said, gives us a fairly clear, simple, and

7

administrable system, and one which is grounded in and

8

limited by the statute, and petitioners -- I can, here,

9

stand in admiration of their willingness to embrace the

Right.

10

full breadth of their position, because what I understand

11

them to be saying is that we read the statute literally,

12

and that therefore, if any State restores the civil rights

13

of a convicted felon, no matter where his original

14

conviction was, then that restoration is good for purposes

15

of Federal law.

16

QUESTION:

No, I don't think they say --

QUESTION:

Your ruling doesn't -- your

18

interpretation doesn't rule out that interpretation for

19

State vis-a-vis State, does it?

20

MR. DuMONT:

Our interpretation does rule out

21

that particular problem, because what we say is, no matter

22

where you are, for purposes of the Federal law you will

23

always look to the civil rights restoration rules of the

24

jurisdiction where you were convicted, whether that be a

Federal jurisdiction or a State jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

It certainly -We're dealing with defenses to a

anybody, if you've ever had a conviction for a felony, you

can't carry a gun in California?

That's absolutely correct, and it

merely points out that there may be a disjuncture between

17

State law and Federal law as to your rights to carry

18

firearms no matter where it is that you happen to be when

Well, it clearly also was intended to

proceeding was that somebody had made a determination that

this person, although he had previously been convicted,

was now eligible to carry firearms, and Congress took the

route of allowing that determination to be made by the

language in the jury statute, which you asked about

5

In other words, somebody actually has to think

paper saying you can carry -- your civil rights are

restored, and that's an interpretation that has not been

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MR. LEWIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

question about somebody living in California and having an

20

old conviction, Congress could have said, has had civil

21

rights restored by the jurisdiction of conviction.

22

It did not have those words, and that's why we

23

went through several pages in our brief, the most recent

I can accept Justice Scalia's suggestion that

5

12

the language nor sensible policy justifies a special rule,

13

and indeed, Justice Scalia said that maybe there should be

14

a provision that title 18 -- a statute should be construed

Why should he not think legitimately, if he has that, that

20

he has met the provision of this Federal statute?
