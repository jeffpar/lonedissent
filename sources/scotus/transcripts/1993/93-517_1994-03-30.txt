CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PETITIONERS
MR LEWIN:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The statute that is being challenged in this

13

case as inconsistent on its face with the Establishment

14

Clause of the First Amendment involves no governmental

15

participation in the teaching and propagation of religious

16

doctrine and underwrites no public employee to participate

17

directly in religious indoctrination.

18

These were factors that were present in the

19

Government program that the Court sustained last term in

20

the Zobrest case, and they led Justices Blackmun and

21

Souter to dissent in that case.

22

By contrast, the New York legislature has

23

authorized the residents of a legally incorporated village

24

that has existed since 1977 that elects a mayor and a

25

village board and enacts ordinances that comprise the code

MR LEWIN:

Not by some general law.

QUESTION:

6

MR LEWIN:

Correct.

7

QUESTION:

Is it fair to say that governmental

8

power was transferred here to a geographic entity based on

9

the religious beliefs and practices of its residents?

10

MR LEWIN:

I think, Justice Kennedy, that that's

11

not a fair characterization.

12

residents of a village.

13

a particular religious denomination, and very devoutly so,

14

but the -- it was not that the statute in any way itself

15

drew lines that distinguished on the basis of religion.

If my characterization that I used in

17

the question were deemed the appropriate characterization,

18

would you lose the case?

19

MR LEWIN:

Well, I don't think so, not even

20

under those circumstances, although that's not this case,

21

Justice Kennedy, because I think that if in fact, as a

22

matter of legislative accommodation, a group of

23

individuals residing in a particular geographic area would

24

warrant having a separate public school for secular

25

reasons, which is what happened in this case, it would be

permissible to accommodate to them, and -- or even to

2

accommodate to their religious practice.

3

Our view is that accommodation by the

4

legislature to the needs of a religious community is

5

permissible.

cdvers garbage disposal within the Village of Kiryas Joel.

7

There's a code that talks about trash disposal.
If a community, for example, said, we will not

8

9

My example would be, for example, this book

accept trash disposal on the Sabbath, on Saturday -- we

10

think it's inappropriate for religious reasons -- if the

11

legislature then said, all right, for that reason we'll

12

allow you to conduct your own trash disposal on some other

13

day of the week, and you do it yourself, we think that's

14

within the spirit of what the free exercise laws --

15

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lewin, if -- if such a law

16

were to neutrally extend to everybody in New York, so that

17

anybody similarly situated could dispose of their own

18

trash, I think you have a very good argument.

19

I have a little trouble seeing why the same

20

analysis applies when the law that you're examining is not

21

neutral.

22

isn't a broadly based law that says people living in a

23

village can have their own school district, whoever they

24

are, whether they're this group or some other group, and

25

yet it seems that New York has chosen to do this quite

It's just limited to this one situation.

One other question, preliminarily.

I guess we

3

wouldn't be here today but for this Court's decision in

4

Aguilar.

5

MR LEWIN:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

6

It's this Court's decision in Aguilar that precipitated

7

the situation that required some action to be taken

8

regarding the disabled children of Kiryas Joel.

9

QUESTION:

If Aguilar --

QUESTION:

And had we held --

11

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

12

QUESTION:

-- otherwise, then the services would

13

be provided with the Federal aid on the premises of the

14

religious schools.

15

QUESTION:

And if that were happening, would the

16

mechanism of the accommodation that is in question here

have been permissible?

21

the vantage point of the overall school district, this is

a preferable accommodation.

Justice O'Connor's, was, had Aguilar v. Felton come out

2

the other way --

3

MR LEWIN:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

And these services had been provided

5

in the private schools themselves, would you then

6

nevertheless have had the constitutional option to have

7

the district formed as it was here?

8

9

MR LEWIN:

No.

If --we agree that if, in fact,

the services were being provided under the pre-Aguilar

10

procedure, there would not have been any justification for

11

the legislature saying we have to accommodate or we have

12

to take this step.

13

be much more basis to argue that this is only being done

14

to provide some kind of authority to these citizens who

15

happen to be religious.

16

QUESTION:

Under those circumstances, there would

Well, Mr. Lewin, may I ask you a

17

question of fact there?

18

the fact that they happen to be religious.

19

the record in this case that the village district upon

20

which the school district was superimposed was -- was

21

defined geographically by reference to the religious

22

affiliation of the people in it, so that non-Satmar

23

Hasidim were excluded, and those within the village all

24

fell within the category of the Satmar sect?

1

really establishes the contrary.
The record establishes that what happened in

2

3

this case -- and it appears in the very first pages of the

4

Joint Appendix -- that what happened in this case was that

5

the original village that was proposed -- and that's at

6

page 12 of the Joint Appendix -- the Satmars presented a

7

petition to form a new village of very large dimensions

8

which included many properties and people not of the

9

Satmar belief, so that consequently the original petition

10

was not in any way limited by where Satmar Hasidim

11

happened to live.
What happened, the real basis for the creation

12

13

of the village was a zoning dispute.

14

have large families -- indeed, I think the record shows

15

there's over 60 percent of the population is under 17

16

years of age, they needed homes which would accommodate

17

larger families, and that precipitated, as I say, a zoning

18

dispute.

19

Since Satmar Hasidim

The consequence ultimately was, as page 13 of

20

the Joint Appendix shows, that a new village on a much

21

smaller scale than originally proposed was presented only

22

because the people who were to be included in the larger

23

area said they did not want to be in this village, so that

1

too, Mr. Lewin, I guess.

2

have larger families we can't have special communities

3

with special zoning rules for them, either.

4

MR LEWIN:

If people for religious reasons

Well, Justice Scalia, of course, our

5

view is that the accommodation authority that legislatures

6

have and that this Court has recognized -- indeed, even as

7

strong a proponent of the Establishment Clause as Justice

8

Brennan in his Texas Monthly case in footnote 8

9

specifically referred to the fact that the authority to

10

accommodate is far broader than the mere confines of the

11

Free Exercise Clause.
QUESTION:

12

But the argument being made is that

13

if they had large families for some other reason, not a

14

religious reason, you could -- you could establish a

15

special community with different zoning laws for that

16

group, but if they have large families for religious

17

reasons, just as this community has certain customs that

18

make it difficult for them to go to another community for

19

their schooling for religious reasons, then it's bad.

20
21

QUESTION:

It seems to me that's the argument

being made.

1

religion, which is protected by the Constitution, becomes

2

the one impermissible vice that invalidates anything

3

that's done, and we think --

4

QUESTION:

But leaving that argument aside, I

5

take it that the upshot of the creation --of the forces

6

that led to the creation of the village was that in fact

7

the village was defined by adherence to this sect.

8

Whether the precipitant for that was concern over zoning,

9

that was the result, I take it.
MR LEWIN:

10

The consequence was -- yes, Justice

11

Souter, that they are -- all the residents of the village

12

are Satmar Hasidim, but the point that I'm trying to

13

make --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, am I right that there's no

15

dispute in this record that compliance with the New York

16

law in establishing villages isn't at issue.

17

easy to form a village, and although this opinion that you

18

cited allows the village rather grudgingly makes the point

19

that whatever this group was, that they met all the

20

requirements of New York State law to form a separate

21

village, so that's --

22

MR LEWIN:

It's rather

There's no dispute, Justice Ginsburg,

23

and I think the petitioners have never challenged the

24

existence of the village.

25

QUESTION:

considerably harder if you didn't have the school district

2

that coincided with the preexisting village boundaries.

3

MR LEWIN:

We acknowledge that.

It would be

4

more difficult.

5

presented whether, in order to accommodate a religious

6

group living within an area which had not previously

7

defined, it would be permissible for the legislature to

8

draw lines to accommodate that religious group, but that's

9

not this case.

10
11
12

13

The question then would be squarely

QUESTION:

Well, you'd say that would be okay,

MR LEWIN:

Well, again, with the caveat that

too.

that is not by any means this case --

14

QUESTION:

I understand.

15

MR LEWIN:

We believe that that is part of the

16
17

spirit of accommodation, that if in fact -QUESTION:

But it would not be all right if,

18

say, a religious body -- say, the board of the

19

synagogue -- had been appointed the board members of the

20

school board.

21

That would --

MR LEWIN:

Absolutely not.

We agree with that,

22

Justice Ginsburg.

It would be impermissible, and here the

23

important point is that this property of the village is

24

privately owned by its residents.

permitted, and indeed, under New York law, may not be

discriminated against if they choose to seek to purchase

4

property in that village.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, will you clear up one

6

factual situation that I'm confused about?

7

the students here residents of this school district?
MR LEWIN:

8

9

Were all of

All -- no, Justice Blackmun.

Currently -- again, initially when the school district was

10

created, it was created with the intention of serving the

11

students in Kiryas Joel, the children of Kiryas Joel.
Once it was created, since it provides a

12

13

bilingual and bicultural program, there are other students

14

who have -- who are disabled from other neighboring

15

communities who have been permitted, under procedures

16

which, Justice O'Connor, in line with your question as to

17

whether this is universal, with procedures which are

18

universal with regard to other school districts and other

19

circumstances have been permitted to attend this public

20

school which neighbors or adjoins their own home

21

districts.

QUESTION:

Roughly how many of them are there,

percentagewise?
MR LEWIN:

Yes, Justice.

7

QUESTION:

Are the children separated by sex, or

8

are they all -- boys and girls take training together?
MR LEWIN:

10
11
12

13

In this school, Justice Stevens, boys

and girls go to class together.
QUESTION:

That puzzles me, because is that

consistent with the religious doctrine?
MR LEWIN:

It is consistent with the religious

14

doctrine, because the views of the Satmar Hasidim and of

15

their religious authorities is that when the purpose of

16

education is this kind of remedial education, which is

17

to -- it is permissible to have boys and girls study

18

together, and so that that has been approved by -- or has

1

long been the practice within the religious community.

8

The points that we wish to emphasize with regard

to this statute is that it is a legislative determination.

10

Justice O'Connor asked whether this applied uniformly.

11

we have indicated, accommodations, we believe, can be

applied, and always are applied, indeed, to particular

situations.

to people with other needs for a day off.
MR LEWIN:

With all respect, Justice O'Connor, I

3

think the Sabbatarian case was one in which this Court

4

felt that there was a burden on others to pick up for the

5

Sabbatarian, and in that footnote in which Justice Brennan

6

in his Texas Monthly case speaks of accommodations, he

7

refers to the fact that that's a distinction, whether the

8

nonobservers are burdened by the statute.

9

In this case, there's no burden on anyone else.

10

This is simply a statute which applies to this

11

municipality and essentially what the courts below have

12

said is that these people, because they are religious,

13

cannot be’ trusted to run a public school system.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, I took you a moment ago in

15

your answer to Justice Kennedy's question about the

16

significance of Aguilar to accept the proposition that in

17

judging what is a permissible, permissive accommodation,

18

that the range of possible alternatives for the

19

accommodation should be considered.

20

think that's a -- basically a fair premise?

21

MR LEWIN:

Is that -- do you

Well, the need for accommodation, I

22

don't think the range of accommodations.

23

this is not an area -- and I know that there is one judge

MR LEWIN:

Judge Kaye, who said, look, this --

2

the least restrictive alternatives standard should apply.

3

We think that's wrong.

4

QUESTION:

When the legislature --

Well, I think I would agree with you

5

there, but you can reject the least alternative theory and

6

still accept the view that alternatives should be

7

considered in deciding just how far the accommodation can

8

legitimately go.

9

MR LEWIN:

I think that's true, and I think it's

10

particularly important in deciding whether there should be

11

any accommodation at all, and under Justice Kennedy's

12

hypothetical, it appeared to me there's no need for any

13

accommodation because this very same service is being

14

performed neutrally by the regular procedures in a way

15

that is perfectly consistent with the religious

16

observance.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin,

I have one question about

one of your copetitioners.
There was a reference by the Monroe-Woodbury

21

School Board in their brief that compared the alleged

22

restraint on sale and rental of property to people outside

23

the Satmar community to a church tithe that the individual

24

is free to pay or not to pay, and I found that disturbing,

25

because as I understand it, there is no choice.

The State law and the Federal law requires that

sale and rental be on a nondiscriminatory basis.

Satmar does not have a choice to refuse to sell to an

The issue here is whether the State's action was

I believe there's a great

difference between the two.

5

QUESTION:

There is?

6

MS. MERESON:

In fact, there's a red line

7

between the two that sometimes is hard to discern,

8

perhaps, but on the one hand you have an ability to

9

tolerate and to acknowledge something that preexists the

10

legislation or State act, and then on the other side, you

11

have things that actually encourage religious practice or

12

make it particularly advantageous to practice a

13

religion -- for instance, the prayer in the schools.

14

Tolerance is a recognition of differences and an

15

alleviation of a burden.

Establishment Clause, the free exercise right, the

tolerance is an accommodation.

Well, do you think that the State's

20

accommodation needs to be neutrally applied, if possible,

so that all people similarly situated have the same

option, or can the State single out one sect or one

23

religious group and provide some benefit there, but not

make it generally applicable?

MS. MERESON:

The neutrality here is not in the

2

sense of applying to all.

3

yes, the State needs to be neutral, but the neutrality

exists in the context of the particular problem.

5

you're dealing --

6

QUESTION:

There is neutrality here, and

When

Well, how is this neutral, if the

7

legislature set up just a special school district for this

8

one situation, instead of passing a law to the effect that

9

groups of people or villages or towns can form their own

10
11

school district by applying neutral criteria?
MS. MERESON:

Because here the legislature was

12

reacting to a particular local problem.

13

problem that did not need a general statute for other

14

groups in the State.

15

QUESTION:

There was a local

The problem here -Isn't it a dangerous precedent to let

16

the legislature tackle a so-called accommodation by

17

singling something out like this, as opposed to passing a

18

neutrally applicable law?

19

MS. MERESON:

There's no need for a broader law,

20

and no, I don't think that it's dangerous for the reason

21

that when you need accommodation sometimes you have a

22

specific problem.

QUESTION:

Ms. Mereson, doesn't the legislature

always single out a school district?

I thought from Mr. Lewin's description that it always

creates school districts single case by single case.

6

MS. MERESON:

Doesn't it create --

When there needs to be new lines

drawn other than the historically existing school

QUESTION:

On the basis of any general criteria,

10

or on the basis of whether a particular group seems to be

11

a community?

12

I assume that's how they do it, isn't it?

MS. MERESON:

Well, normally these special lines

13

that are drawn by the legislature are called special acts

14

school districts, and they are coterminous with

15

institutions, so they would be created in response to a

16

need for them, which is what happened here.

The problem with the former is that there would

this dispute between the Monroe-Woodbury School District

and the Kiryas Joel parents, that they would be taking

In fact, you can make the exact

Wasn't that Judge Kaye's position in

Wasn't that essentially her position?

MS. MERESON:

That was her position, but we

disagree with her position, because if the New York State

QUESTION:

Yes, but I had thought that it was

the whole basis of both sides in this case that the

conceded fact that the rationale for the drawing of the

geographic lines of this district was the religious

beliefs and practices of its residents, pure and simple.

16

MS. MERESON:

There's one factor in between,

QUESTION:

The parents didn't think it was

MR. WORONA:

Well, that may be true, Your Honor,

6

but when we look at a statute to determine whether we are

7

responding to bilingual, bicultural needs of a community,

8

and we see a school district has in fact responded to
those needs, certainly we cannot ignore that particular

11
12

fact.

it is responding to the religious needs.

MR. WORONA:

QUESTION:

seems to me they're responding to purely cultural needs,

television, and so forth.

18

MR. WORONA:

However, Your Honor, in the court

1

of appeals decision in Monroe-Woodbury v. Wieder, we saw

services as long as they acquired a segregated environment

And they were cut back to the -- but

4

the original proposal was for a larger village that would

MR. WORONA:

That's correct, Your Honor, but the

reality that we cannot ignore is that those boundary lines

8

were specifically drawn to only include members of the

9

Satmar Hasidic community.

10

In the petition which is before you on Joint

11

Appendix page 10, in the first full paragraph, the

12

supervisor of the Town of Monroe in signing this petition

13

indicated that the residents are and will be all of the

14

Satmar Hasidic persuasion.

15

sociological way of life for the Satmar Hasidim is one of

disdained isolation from the rest of the community.

He indicated that the

concerns, I suppose that facility would be constitutional

7

MR. WORONA:

Everything's the same,

Your Honor, if I may respond in two

8

parts, firstly, the establishment of that type of a school

9

for these individuals would certainly not have an element

10

that is involved in this particular case, which is that we

11

would not be imbuing a religious community with

12

governmental powers and functions, and we certainly would

13

not be

QUESTION:

Well, do you see a difference -- you

keep saying, religious community.

16

closest to this one, the precedents that are closest, as

17

you know, involve a religious body being given the

authority, a church body, where here it's citizens of a

are not themselves church, synagogue officials.

2

that in order to analogize this particular community to

that of a church, we do need to look at the entire context

4

in which this particular statute was enacted.

5

I agree with the point that you're making.

I think

Mr. Lewin even in his reply brief has

6

acknowledged that this particular section -- or this

7

particular statute is in fact placing the Satmars in a

8

position where they would have been without the statute --

9

QUESTION:

What you're saying is that the

Satmars, because they all live together, can't exercise

11

the ordinary kind of secular authority that any other

group living together could.

Justice's Roman Catholic group?

the New York law is otherwise the same, and you can only

charter school districts on a case-by-case basis, it would

do the same thing there that it would do here.
MR. WORONA:

11

Of course it would.

If

Well, that's precisely the point

that the respondents are making, and we believe -QUESTION:

But isn't the difference that there

12

wouldn't be any alternative to having a school district in

13

the Roman Catholic case, where there is an alternative to

14

having this school district in this case?

15

MR. WORONA:

That's correct, because this school

16

district, Your Honor, was one of a -- was part of an

17

existing school district at the time, which I think is a

18

very big distinction, and indeed, the establishment of

this school district I think would violate some

fundamental principles of the Establishment Clause.

the reason of acquiring governmental powers and functions

to live an insular life style in conformity with their

3

religious precepts, I suppose that would be

4

unconstitutional as well, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

Well, is it a necessary element of

6

your answer that they want to live an insular lifestyle?

7

What's that got to do with the First Amendment?
MR. WORONA:

8

9

Well, it has to do with the First

Amendment in that I don't think this particular culture

10

can be divorced from its religious traditions and

11

practices.
QUESTION:

12

How would you distinguish this from,

13

say, just a community in Utah, where the people in a

14

village are all coreligionist?

15

MR. WORONA:

As I understand the formation of

16

Utah, certainly the United States Government required the

17

Mormons, who were predominantly occupying the State prior

18

to it becoming a State, they were required to put special

19

provisions in their Constitution to protect the United

20

States from acquiring a State that would be arguably

21

theocratic, and the difference, I think, is that if

22

somebody happens to move into a place where there isn't --

23

there is not already an existing school district that is

serving them, we have a situation where there is a secular

Well, Your Honor --

As I understand it, Your Honor,

19

every single -- every single parcel of land in New York

principal purposes of this statute was to transfer

governmental power to a group of persons by reason of

MR. WORONA:

I suppose the answer to that

question is, we believe that a political constituency

defined along religious lines has in fact been established

by the statute, Your Honor.
The particular community of individuals who are

13

devoutly religious were imbued with governmental powers

QUESTION:

To allow them
Because it seems to me, otherwise you

3

cannot distinguish your case from the Chief Justice's

4

hypothetical.

5

MR. WORONA:

Well, I think the purpose certainly

6

here is one of segregation along religious lines.

7

the pursuit of that particular principle that was

8

primarily sought after, and indeed was advanced by this

9

legislation.
QUESTION:

10

It was

The -- aren't you giving two

11

different answers?

I mean, you're giving a purpose answer

12

to Justice Kennedy, and a moment ago you gave a no

13

alternative answer to me when we were discussing the

14

problem posed by the Chief's hypothetical on the Roman

15

Catholics.

16

Is the problem, as you see it, that there was an

17

express purpose to transfer power to a religious group, or

18

is the problem here that there were alternatives to doing

19

that, to accomplish the same result, and they didn't avail

20

themselves of the alternatives?

21

MR. WORONA:

Which is it?

Well, we're not suggesting it's

22

necessarily the latter.

I think having the latter present

23

will perhaps provide a greater effect of

unconstitutionality of this particular piece of

legislature designed this particular piece of legislation

2

to allow this particular religious community to dictate

3

what educational services would be provided in conformity

4

with their traditions and beliefs.

5

QUESTION:

I don't see why that isn't present in

6

a good many communities, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, in

7

the State of Utah, where members of the Church of Latter

8

Day Saints live in certain communities and want to have

9

their own school districts, and they do, so under your

10
11

view, all those would be invalid.
MR. WORONA:

No, I don't believe they would all

12

be invalid, Your Honor, I believe that this case can only

13

be analyzed in looking at the entire context in which this

14

particular legislation was effectuated.

15

If, indeed, we have a community, as I answered

16

the Chief Justice before, that happens to be of a

17

particular religious persuasion, which happens to have a

18

school district, that doesn't necessarily make it

19

constitutionally infirm.

20

here is by setting up political constituencies defined

21

along religious lines --

QUESTION:

The constitutional infirmity

Well, it's defined along cultural --

different things in education?

Was Judge Kaye's accommodation okay?

of the hardest problems as I see it is that these people

MR. WORONA:

I think that's the

Well, it really isn't, Your Honor.

10

I think the essence of our argument, if we were looking at

11

Lemon v. Kurtzman and its three prongs, would be the

12

second prong, because chapter 748 of the laws of 1989

13

communicates a message of endorsement to the public, and

14

they may fairly understand that the purpose of this act

15

was to accommodate Satmar separatist beliefs, and the

16

public perception of endorsement is reinforced by this

statute in that it's not a statute of general

applicability, as many justices have already noted.

The respondents in this action believe that this
particular action of the New York State legislature, if

the one that's here.
MR. WORONA:

This is a facial challenge, right?
Well, that's correct, Your Honor,

3

but we think the record is very clear about the points

4

that you are maintaining.

5

For example, prior to the establishment of this

6

school district, the Monroe-Woodbury Central School

7

District urged the Governor to sign this legislation, and

8

they indicated that if a non-Hasidic child requiring
regular education moved into the Kiryas Joel School

10

District's geographic boundaries, and then -- this is on

11

page 22 of the Joint Appendix, and this is virtually

12

impossible.

The child would be tuitioned to Monroe-

20

extraordinary?

21

MR. WORONA:

Why do you find that so

Because if we look at what was

22

provided -- and Your Honor is quite correct, we are

23

dealing with a situation here where looking at

24

disabilities laws is a Federal statute and would not

25

necessarily be a constitutional impermissibility.

However, if these children are incapable of

2

acquiring their rights under Federal and State law, and we

3

understand why, and that is because their parents wished

4

to maintain a lifestyle, then --

5

QUESTION:

It's like a parent in the

hypothetical I gave you who wants her child to have sex

7

education and seeks permission from the school district on

8

the one side of the tracks to send the child to the school

9

district on the other side.

10

MR. WORONA:

What's so wrong about that?

Well, again, I think the principal

11

point of where we maintain our argument, which a crucial

12

distinction is that there is not an imbuing of

13

governmental powers and functions upon an individual in

14

that situation.

There is simply --

QUESTION:

16

MR. WORONA:

QUESTION:

Isn't there --- that is provided.
Isn't there also another difference,

18

and that is the Monroe-Woodbury School District didn't

19

have a plan to tuition-out every student from this

20

community, whereas what you have just read to us sounds

21

like a plan to tuition out every one who is not a member

22

of the community.

23

MR. WORONA:

Right.

I think that is a crucial

24

distinction, Your Honor, and I think that certainly under

the benefits that are being sought here.

Indeed, when

2

they began this litigation in Monroe-Woodbury v. Wieder,

3

the case that was looking for a neutral site, they

4

maintained that they could not serve these children any

5

other place but the public schools.
The court of appeals, New York State's highest

6

7

court, ruled that that was not necessarily true.

8

also maintained that there was some constitutional

9

infirmities with segregating these children along

They

10

religious lines, and now they stand before you today and

11

indicate that it is not necessarily unconstitutional to do

12

the same thing by having New York State segregate children

13

along religious lines.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Worona, on the tuitioning out, do

15

I understand correctly that the people who tuitioned out

16

are the regular students for whom there are no facilities,

17

but if they were someone -- a disabled child who was

18

from -- who was not of the Satmar community, that person

wouldn't be tuitioned out, would that person?

statute have a regular school.

thought the suggestion which I guess was made by Chief

Judge Kaye that the State could have set up a separate
neutral place for the education of these handicapped

It could have been

unconstitutional.

I don't believe it necessarily would

have been unconstitutional.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PETITIONERS

20

MR LEWIN:

With respect to Judge Kaye's

22

it's the wrong test, we think it's not clear that that's

23

the least restrictive alternative by any means.

conclude, what is the least restrictive alternative?

2

Monroe-Woodbury School District itself prefers this

solution, which apparently it believes is less restrictive

in terms of the overall school district, than the solution

of forcing them to provide neutral sites.
