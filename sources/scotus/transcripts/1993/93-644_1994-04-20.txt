ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
10

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

11

supreme court of Oregon to decide whether a defendant in a

12

civil case has a right to any judicial review of a jury

13

verdict alleged to be excessive under applicable State or

14

Federal substantive damages law, or indeed, a plaintiff

15

claiming that a verdict is insufficient.

16

In the Texaco Pennzoil case a punitive verdict

17

of $3 billion was returned by the jury, and it was reduced

18

on judicial review by $2 billion.

1

Motor Company, a $125 million punitive verdict was reduced

20

to $3-1/2 million.

21

verdict was reduced by the Court to $35 million.

22

23

QUESTION:

In Grimshaw v. Ford

In Proctor v. Upjohn, a $125 million

These are State court decisions

you're referring to?

24

MR. FREY:

These are State court decisions.

QUESTION:

What standard is it that those courts

use in assessing punitive damages?
MR. FREY:

Well, there's a lot of debate about

what the standard - - you mean in determining whether a - -

4
5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

MR. FREY:

-- punitive verdict is excessive?

7

The standards may vary.

They are a matter of

8

the State substantive law of damages, the State

9

substantive law of punitive damages, which will set up a

10

structure for determining the amount of damages not in any

11

liquidated or definite sense, but in some general sense.

12

It will identify factors that are relevant, it

13

may call for proportionality review with other verdicts,

14

it may limit --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, what were the standards

employed in the cases you were reciting?
MR. FREY:

Well, I'm not certain what the

18

standards were, but I don't think it matters for the

19

purposes of this Court's decision.

20

wanted to make is that if those verdicts had been returned

21

in Oregon, the Court would have lacked the power to

22

consider whether they conform to the law of Oregon.

23

25

QUESTION:

The only point that I

Well, what standard are you asserting

is constitutionally mandated, Mr. Frey?
MR. FREY:

Well, I think it's very important in

1

understanding this question to distinguish between the

2

procedural due process requirement -- that is, what

3

procedures must be provided, which is what we're talking

4

about this morning, and the substantive law of damages,

5

which is to say, what law determines how much is an

6

acceptable range of damages on a given set of facts?

7

We are not saying in this case that the State of

8

Oregon, or that the other States in those cases, have to

9

have any particular substantive law of damages.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, would it be sufficient for

11

a State to say, as long as the award is not the product of

12

passion or prejudice, it is not excessive?

13

MR. FREY:

I doubt that.

The question -- if

14

you're asking for passion or prejudice -- if you are

15

saying to me -- I guess I want to give a two-part answer

16

to that question, if I may.

17

The first is, passion or prejudice means

18

different things.

19

used as a rubric for actually conducting excessiveness

20

review, but it could be the reverse.

21

In our view, the term is ordinarily

That is, you could look at the size of the

22

verdict and say it's a product of passion and prejudice,

23

or you could say, we will not look at the size of the

24

verdict at all, but if we see other evidence, such as an

25

improper jury argument or some other extraneous evidence

1

that might cause passion and prejudice.
QUESTION:

2

The thing about punitive damages

3

review, it seems to me, is that if you're reviewing a

4

verdict for actual damages and talk about passion or

5

prejudice or the weight of it, you've got some fairly

6

concrete things to hang on to - - the amount of the

7

medicals, the amount of -- cost of maintaining someone

8

who's disabled -- but the punitive damage is much, much

9

harder to pin down.

10

MR. FREY:

Well, it may be much harder to pin

11

down, and that suggests that there is a difference between

12

liquidated kinds of damages inquiry and the kind of

13

unliquidated inquiry where you're asking how much pain and

14

suffering the plaintiff experienced as a result of his or

15

her injury, or how much is an appropriate amount of

16

punishment.

17

But State law says, for example, deterrence is

18

relevant.

19

important.

20

disproportionate to other verdicts that have been returned

21

in the State.

22

State law may say comparative review is
That is, the verdict should not be

Now, I'm not saying the Federal Constitution

23

requires the State to have such a rule, but I am saying,

24

if the State does have such a rule, we have a right to

25

have that rule applied to the verdict in the case by a

1

judge to determine whether the verdict comports with the

2

State's substantive law of damages.

3

The State's substantive law of damages may be

4

that damages are disfavored and should be small in product

5

liability cases, because they affect the -- punitive

6

damages, let's say, because they affect the cost of goods

to consumers.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, what are the, then -- you

said you're not talking about substantive limits today.
What are the procedural limits?
You have not answered whether passion and

12

prejudice -- maybe you want to continue that.

13

interested in knowing whether you think a remittitur

14

device is constitutionally required, whether you think

15

it's compatible with due process to have a new trial

16

limited to the punitive damages only, or whether you'd

17

have to have an entire trial.

18

components of this due process for which you're arguing?

19

MR. FREY:

I would be

What exactly are the

Okay, well, let me see if I can take

20

those in order, and forgive me if I forget some of them,

21

but to start out, I do want to complete the answer to

22

Justice Stevens.

23

I think passion and prejudice is not enough,

24

because even a well meaning jury not inflamed by passion

25

and prejudice can make a mistake.

They can misunderstand

the legal constraints.

with an aberrant verdict which violates the State law,

substantive law of damages.

4

QUESTION:

They can come up in good faith

How could we ever tell that if it

5

comports with the, sort of the ultimate substantive

6

standard of bearing at least a reasonable relationship to

7

the facts of the case?

8

MR. FREY:

You would never have to tell that.

9

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

10

MR. FREY:

You would never have to tell that.

11

That is, the Supreme Court would not be asked that

12

question.

13

The State supreme court -- there is a State law

14

of damages.

the judge has to determine the amount of damages.

form of a code, but it exists.

There are principles that

For instance, to take compensatory damages for

20

pain and suffering, the amount is supposed to be the

21

amount that would appropriately compensate the plaintiff

22

for injury.

23

within which reasonable people could disagree, and it may

24

be a very substantial range, and any verdict that is

25

within that range by a jury, or any judgment returned by a

Now, I understand that there is a range

1

judge within that range, is acceptable, but -- and

2

therefore not subject to being set aside.

3

QUESTION:

Well, then, with respect to punitive

4

damages, why isn't any verdict acceptable if it bears

5

the -- if it can be said to bear a reasonable relationship

6

to those facts in evidence which would indicate that

7

punitive damages were appropriate?

8

MR. FREY:

Because State law may impose greater

constraints than that on punitive damages.
10
11

State law may

have a whole set of rules, and often does.
QUESTION:

Well, but your argument -- then,

12

maybe I'm missing something.

Your argument at this point

13

seems to be boiling down to this:

14

provides, we ought to get.

whatever State law

15

MR. FREY:

Whatever State law provides --

16

QUESTION:

And State law doesn't provide

17
18

anything, apparently, for you here.
MR. FREY:

No, no, no.

What State law doesn't

1

provide -- there is an Oregon law of damages.

20

sure what it is.

21

was rightly or wrongly applied, because Article VII,

22

section 3 of the Oregon constitution deprives the Oregon

23

courts of the right to apply that law of damages to the

24

verdict in any particular case.

compensatory damages review, too?

2

MR. FREY:

Absolutely.

3

QUESTION:

You contend that that constitutional

4

provision prevents the Oregon courts from even applying

5

passion and prejudice review, don't you --

6

MR. FREY:

We -- that --

7

QUESTION:

-- and although you don't assert that

8

passion or prejudice review will suffice for purposes of

9

constitutional sufficiency, you deny that there was even

10

passion or prejudice --

11

MR. FREY:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

-- review here, don't you?

13

MR. FREY:

That is correct.

14

QUESTION:

But you don't deny, I take it, that

15

there was at least the possibility of review for that --

16

we'll say that ultimate substantive threshold --

17

MR. FREY:

There is no possibility --

18

QUESTION:

-- which is required by the Supremacy

MR. FREY:

No, I don't -- this gets into -- this

19
20

Clause.

21

is not the main point in our argument.

We believe that we

22

are entitled to have the verdict reviewed for its

23

compliance with both State and Federal substantive law of

24

damages, whatever that law is, and in the case of the Due

25

Process Clause -10

QUESTION:

1

I take it, however, that Oregon has

2

not denied you, at least in terms, any substantive -- any

3

review under a substantive Federal standard that you claim

4

is applicable.
MR. FREY:

5

We believe the Oregon courts are

6

without jurisdiction under State law to conduct such

7

review, and we believe we were deprived of that review.
QUESTION:

8

Have they ever come out and said,

9

there is a Federal standard constitutionally applicable to

10

us, but our constitution forbids us to entertain an appeal

11

on that ground?
MR. FREY:

12

They haven't come out and said it,

13

but they have come out and said that verdicts that are

14

excessive, they lack the jurisdiction, the power, to set

15

aside.

16

that a verdict was excessive.

17

QUESTION:

They lack the power to review and consider a claim

Can you tell us what is this

process.

21

What process are you

I feel a little nebulous about that.

You say, some

What is that process?
MR. FREY:

The process that we say -- well,

22

let's start off with what we get, which is, when a verdict

23

is returned, we get no judge to examine whether the

24

verdict conforms with the substantive law that regulates

25

the size of verdicts.

We do not get that review, in our

opinion.

There's a debate about whether we do or we

position - -

4

QUESTION:

Our

But you do get a review for no

5

evidence, and you get a review if the judge thinks that

6

the instructions were not adequate.

7

MR. FREY:

All right, I have two --we get a

8

review for no evidence, which means a review for

9

liability.

That is, whether punitive liability is

10

established, and I might say that I think the no evidence

11

standard is not constitutionally acceptable itself, and

12

Jackson v. Virginia provides some support for that.

13

It rejects the no-evidence standard in favor of

14

taking the facts in the light most favorable to the

15

verdict, could any reasonable jury define the standard,

16

but that's not the main point.

17

We say that giving instructions to the jury does

18

not cure the unfairness of being unable to correct an

19

aberrational jury verdict that violates the State law of

20

damages, or the Federal law of damages, and we say that

21

part of the right to which we are entitled, which is a

22

right that has existed for centuries in the common law

23

system, which is a right that exists every place else in

24

the United States, is to have a judge look at that verdict

25

and ask himself or herself, does it comport with the law.

1

That is the procedure.
QUESTION:

2

Suppose the judge looks at the amount

3

of the prayer in the complaint before the issue is

4

submitted to the jury, and concludes that on this

5

evidence, that maximum amount would be a sustainable

6

award.

7

Does it have to be a retrospective assessment?
MR. FREY:

I guess I have two things to say

8

about that.

9

questions you can ask about the State procedural system in

10
11

The first is that there are two kinds of

determining whether it's sufficiently fair.
The first question is whether some ingredient is

12

an indispensable element such as an unbiased

13

decisionmaker, or we say some form of judicial review

14

wherever the jury is given substantial discretion.

15

You can also ask a question whether the overall

16

system, which is what the Oregon court asks, whether the

17

overall system is fair enough, taking into account various

18

other protections.

19

Now, we don't think Oregon has -- certainly we

20

had no notice that this is the procedure by which you

21

could do it.

22

have that happen.

I think it would be better than nothing to

1

law is that you are not liable to pay damages to a

2

plaintiff who was contributorily negligent, I have

3

difficulty with the proposition that a fair system

4

provides no judicial review.
So I would have my doubts, although I think our

case is a substantially stronger case than that, but I

would doubt whether that would be constitutionally

sufficient.

held that, but we have made the point that it hasn't been

I understand there's a case from 1919 that

10

cited for over 60 years, and that it's inconsistent, we

11

think, with the Court's modern procedural due process

doctrine.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, why should the

14

constitutionally mandated review be any more than is

15

required in a criminal case, for example?

MR. FREY:

I don't know that we're asking for

any more than is required in a criminal case.

standard.

QUESTION:

2

Is there any justification for

3

requiring more than would be required on review in a

4

criminal case in a punitive damages case?

5

MR. FREY:

No.

I don't think we're suggesting

6

that more would be required, but it may depend on what the

7

State law is.

8

more is required, but I have to say that I doubt that in a

QUESTION:

12

13

Well, I would have thought the

standard was the one I mentioned in Jackson.

14

MR. FREY:

Well, I'm perfectly willing to

15

accept -- I mean, I think the standard on how you assess

16

the facts is you take the facts in the light most

17

favorable to the verdict, and you ask whether any

reasonable juror, or any reasonable jury, in light of

those facts, could -- applying the law to those facts,

Now, if you ask me would I be satisfied with

10

that, in the Haslip case, what the Court did was, it

11

looked at the system that Alabama had, and it said this

12

overall system is a procedurally fair system in part

13

because the Alabama courts give a kind of review which

14

clearly is more than the Constitution would require if you

15

looked at that element standing alone.

16

But the Alabama system was marginal at best in

17

the quality of the jury instructions that were given, and

18

the Court looked at the overall system, so I'm reluctant

19

to say that the overall Oregon system is a fair enough

20

system for administering punitive damages.

21

But what we are asking for today is that we

22

have, at a minimum, a judge apply something like the

23

Jackson standard.

17

You wouldn't have to have a remittitur,

MR. FREY:

A remittitur is a device to which

18

defendants object, because it is a substitute for a new

19

trial, which defendants want.

20

is constitutionally required, but it is actually a proÂ­

substitute for a new trial.

limited to damages, that would be all right, too.
MR. FREY:

2

Nothing that we say here today raises

3

that problem.

I don't want to be taken to be conceding

4

when we get back to the Oregon court that the rest of the

5

system is sufficient, but for purposes of this Court's

6

review, the only question we present is whether Oregon is

7

obligated to have a judge examine this verdict in light of

8

the Federal and State substantive law of damages and ask

9

whether the verdict is excessive or not under that law.
QUESTION:

10

And you say that in light of some

11

history that there was a time when the jury even decided

12

questions of law, when at least in some places jury

Yes.

MR. FREY:

9

Well, I mean -- there are -- well,

10

the courts don't, I think, analyze the matter that way.

11

They characterize the verdict in explaining why they set

it aside.

13

Sometimes they say the verdict is the product of

passion and prejudice, or it's so large that it must be

the product of passion and prejudice.

it's excessive.

Sometimes they say

it may be excessive in the abuse of discretion sense, that

To be specific, Mr. Frey, there was a

that maybe this Court was wrong about what the common law

MR. FREY:

There were some

evolved in the 17th and 18th Centuries, one of the

Yes, the Court could revisit

So there's no issue preclusion on

that point.

7

MR. FREY:

I'm not -- well, stare decisis I

8

suppose would be the question.

I'm not saying that the

9

Court is bound, but I'm saying that if you revisit it, and

10

even if you didn't revisit it, cases like Jackson I think

11

make clear that there is an obligation.
In the Fowler case in the Oregon supreme court

12

13

in 1954, they said, if this court were authorized to

14

exercise its common law powers we would unhesitatingly

15

hold that the award of $35,000 as punitive damages was

16

excessive, but they say under Article VII, section 3 we

17

are without power to consider whether or not the punitive

18

damages were excessive.
Now, I am saying that a provision that deprives

19
20

them of the power to reverse a verdict that they would

21

unhesitatingly say is excessive under State law is not

22

consistent with fundamental fairness.

3

MR. FREY:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

What State rule of substantive law

5

are you arguing was not applied?
MR. FREY:

6

Well, we are arguing that the

7

State --we argued below that the verdict, both the

8

compensatory and the punitive were excessive, but we

9

argued for -QUESTION:

10

But is it a State rule of law that

11

the damages award may not be excessive as long as it

12

complies with the instructions and the various criteria

13

that they describe?

14

MR. FREY:

I think the correct way to think of

15

it is that is a State rule.

16

of substantive law or not, that the damages may not be

17

excessive.

18

I don't know if that's a rule

I think it is a rule.

It is a rule that the

19

courts of Oregon are without power to apply in jury

20

trials, but if you had a bench trial --

21

QUESTION:

But you're begging the question.

I

22

mean, you're saying, as you put it, you said, even if the

23

Oregon supreme court finds that the damages are excessive

24

under State law, the constitutional provision says that

25

they cannot review it for that excessiveness.

Another way to view the constitutional provision

1

2

is as saying, in effect, there is no such thing as

3

excessiveness of damages for purposes of Oregon

4

substantive law.

5

MR. FREY:

You could -- you could --

6

QUESTION:

There is no such thing.

7

MR. FREY:

You could, but they have never said

8

9

that.
They have clearly said that there are verdicts

10

that are ex -- in the Van Lom case, they said they were of

11

the opinion that the verdict was excessive, but they

12

lacked the power to set it aside.

13

In a bench trial, it's clear that there would be

14

law that would govern this, and they could review it in a

15

bench trial.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, they said it was excessive, but

they didn't say it violated the law of Oregon.

18

MR. FREY:

Well --

19

QUESTION:

In other words, they -- isn't it

20

consistent -- isn't it a reading of what they said simply

21

that if we were writing on a clean slate we'd probably

22

have a thirteenth juror rule that says -- that would in

23

fact overturn this verdict, but we don't have a clean

24

slate, and we do not have the authority -- i.e., the law

25

of Oregon does not give us the authority or provide a

Standard for review?
MR. FREY:

No, but that's not what they said.

3

First of all, we're not talking about thirteenth juror

4

review, and in my opinion, when they say that the judgment

5

is manifestly excessive and they would set it aside, they

6

are saying that it is unlawful, under Oregon law.

7

believe that is what they are saying.

8

that that's what they're saying.

I

I think it's clear

9

QUESTION:

Are they saying --

10

MR. FREY:

Now, where did the power --

11

QUESTION:

-- that it was an error for the trial

12

judge to submit the case to the jury on the state of the

13

complaint where an award up to $5 million could be

14

returned by the jury?

15

MR. FREY:

I guess if you asked the question at

16

that time, and if you were going to spend the time in

17

every case for the one case in 50 or 100 where a question

18

actually arises.

19

This is not the procedure of Oregon.

I think we

20

can confidently say that the judge would not have

21

undertaken any inquiry - -

22

QUESTION:

A judge must submit to the jury any

punitive damages request that the plaintiff cooks up in

the complaint?

25

quite the opposite.

MR. FREY:

1

The rule is that it can't exceed the

2

amount in the complaint.

3

sought in

It can't exceed the amount

4

QUESTION:

But the complaint can exceed --

5

MR. FREY:

$50 million or $500 million.

6

QUESTION:

The complaint can exceed an amount of

7

what the evidence would justify?
MR. FREY:

8

9

Well, the complaint is the complaint.

Then you have the evidence.
If the judge undertook -- I agree that it is

10
11

theoretically possible, although I don't believe that

12

Oregon has such a procedure, to ask the judge in every

13

case ahead of time to determine the limit of the damages

14

that would be allowable, but I don't think we have to use

15

that procedure, and I don't think Oregon has that

16

procedure.

17

If it wanted to adopt such a cumbersome and

18

burdensome and time-consuming and resource-consuming

19

procedure, maybe that procedure would be good enough to

20

satisfy the Constitution, but I don't think it has that

21

procedure, and I don't think we can be held to have

22

defaulted in this case for not employing this -- or

23

certainly the Oregon supreme court didn't suggest that

24

that was why we were not getting review.

25

I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. TRIBE:

may it please the Court:

7
8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

I think I might begin with, I think a crucial
question that Justice Kennedy has been pressing, because I
was rather surprised by the answer.
It seems to us that really no argument whatever

10
11

has been offered by Honda, either historical or

12

functional, for the peculiar thing they say they have a

13

right to as a matter of procedural due process, namely,

14

review by a judge after the verdict -- and I underline the

15

phrase, after the verdict -- to assure compliance with

16

State law.

17

Now, apart from the proposition which I think

18

has been explored by Justice Souter and Justice Scalia of

1

how circular their claim is - - I mean, State law doesn't

20

give them what they say they have a right to - - and apart

21

from the decisions of this Court, summarized in a footnote

22

in our brief, holding that there is no Federal right to

23

make sure you get everything the State promises, outside

24

the very limited context of Cleveland v. Loudermill and

25

entitlement theory, apart from that, the fact is that

1

Oregon has precisely the procedure about which Justice

2

Kennedy asked, and it's not that different from Federal

3

practice, although it's in a damages context.

4

The leading case, indeed, their brief reads as

5

though this Court granted cert to review it 44 years out

6

of time, is Van Lorn, in Oregon, in 1949, and Van Lorn very

7

carefully, at page 467 of 210 Pacific 2nd, reviews a

8

series of cases -- Lyons, McDaniels, Weatherspoon, British

9

Empire -- all explicitly holding that it is legal error,

10

reversible notwithstanding Article VII, section 3, which

11

just prevents reexamination of a jury verdict based on

12

evidence, legal error for a judge not to cap the damages

13

at the highest level the judge believes would be

14

sustainable under the evidence.

15

That, in a sense, disposes of this case.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tribe, you and your

17

you is right as to the nature of the review Oregon

affords?

MR. TRIBE:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, if that

were the case, then one would affirm this judgment,

10

because there is no showing that Oregon violates anything

11

that is comprehensible as procedural due process, since

12

Oregon -- I mean, I suppose you could say -- it depends on

13

what you were unsure of.

14

If you were unsure whether Oregon provided even

15

judicial review to see that the instructions complied with

16

Federal requirements, if you believed that Oregon, in

17

response to Justice Souter's question, had somehow defied

18

Federal law and said no, we will not apply Haslip, even

19

though we did in this case, if there were some

20

ambiguity -- that is, if looking at this case you couldn't

21

tell whether Oregon is one of those States that is simply

22

defying the Supremacy Clause, I suppose you could vacate

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

8

Right, Justice Ginsburg --

-- and that wouldn't do.
Fowler v. Courtemanche in Oregon, in

1 54, which is in our footnote 35, definitively rejects
the scintilla rule, says no evidence means no substantial

10

evidence, and the one ambiguity that I've found in Oregon

11

law in this respect is the question whether a trial judge

12

has a sua sponte duty to look at the evidence, even

13

without a request.

14

That is, suppose it's clear to the judge on the

15

basis of the record that, under State law, the highest

award that could have been sustainable here under the noÂ­

17

evidence rule, meaning no substantial evidence, or

18

whatever standard Mr. Frey wants this Court to adopt is,

what's the highest that would make sense under Oregon's

21

substantive law.

22

Let's suppose it's $2 million.

The judge who is able to determine that after

there being required, but no request was made.
For example, in the closing argument to the

the amount that's sought is not excessive?
MR. TRIBE:

2

No, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not saying

3

that judges do that in every case.

Van Lorn endorsed the

4

proposition that, if asked, they have a duty to do it.
There is contest over whether they ought to do

5
6

it sua sponte, and because, as the chief justice points

7

out, there are many cases in which it would be very hard

8

to say in advance that a verdict of more than X, where X

9

is less than the ad damnum requested would be excessive,

10

they don't do it.
But it's not easier to say after the jury has

12

spoken, that's the point.

QUESTION:

You see, whatever --

Mr. Tribe, I dare say that judges of

Oregon are not going to thank you for establishing the

proposition that they can be asked ex ante, before the

No.

He knows in Oregon that they

can't give more than $5 million, and he can at least say
this:

who would be able to say that before the fact.

It is

equally a rare judge who would be able to say, hmm, now

13

they're quoting from Van Lorn.

They are complaining that Oregon has eliminated

the power of a trial court to reexamine the evidence and

set aside a verdict because it was excessive, or in any

MR. TRIBE:

10

In Fowler v. Courtemanche at page

11

275 the court uses the phrase, substantial evidence,

12

Justice Ginsburg.

13

Let me answer your question, Justice Scalia, in

14

this additional way.

15

since 1989 on the premise that that kind of review is

16

available.

17

it's absolutely clear what happened there.

18

asking for passion or prejudice review.

19

the fact that there was authority to grant it.

20

answered on the merits.

21

This entire case has been tried

If you look at the new trial and JNOV briefs
They were

We didn't fight
We

In their brief, filed below on, I believe it was

22

June 22nd, 1989, they make quite a bit of the fact that

23

Oberg does not dispute the authority of the Oregon courts

24

to engage in passion or prejudice review.

25

dispute it.

We have never disputed it.

There's just some uncertainly about

what that means.

They simply -- there was no indication of it.

MR. TRIBE:

Sure.

That's right.

I mean,

precisely what it means, I can't say, but -QUESTION:

6

Do you think there is reason to

7

believe it means functionally something different from the

8

Federal substantive standard?

9

MR. TRIBE:

I honestly don't. I think the --as

10

I understand the plurality opinion in TXO, the notion of

11

gross excess, though it's a different verbal formulation,

12

really has to mean excess in relation to something, as

13

Justice Kennedy pointed out in his concurring opinion.

14

Nothing is excessive in itself.

15

I was earlier remembering this business where

16

the emperor says of Mozart, you know, too many notes.

17

Well, which ones do you want me to remove, your majesty?

18

I mean, too many for what, and the -- I think the test,

19

and we all grapple for verbal formulations of it -- I

20

think the test ultimately, whether it's gross

21

excessiveness, or infection by something other than

22

rational processes reasoning from the evidence, ultimately

23

comes to the same thing, and it's essentially a Federal

24

test.

2

what respect is Oregon different from any other State?

3

Your argument seems to go to the effect that there is

4

review.

5

In

It's the same as in the other States.
MR. TRIBE:

No, it's less, Justice Ginsburg.

6

It's different in this respect.

When the Oregon supreme

7

court said, we occupy a lonely eminence, we were comparing

8

themselves to those States, and they are many, that do

9

weight-of-the-evidence review, not quite thirteenth-juror

10

in every case, but substantial reexamination on whether

11

something was adequately supported in the evidence.

12

really a new trial standard with respect to facts.

13

Oregon won't go that far.

It's

That is, the Oregon

14

reexamination bar is more stringent than the Seventh

15

Amendment's reexamination bar in the sense that even

16

though at common law one could undermine a jury verdict by

17

disagreeing with it in effect, in certain limited

18

circumstances, as long as one had made a directed verdict

19

motion first.

20

QUESTION:

I think your answer suggests a degree

21

of precision among these various doctrines that just

22

doesn't exist.

23

courts have said, well, we see that some States use weight

24

of the evidence, thirteenth juror, we're not going to use

25

it, we're going to use substantial evidence, as if these

ten times the actual damage award -- just assume that --

Are you saying Oregon would provide

That's what we have to decide, isn't

it?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, no, I don't think so, Justice

13

Stevens, because in this case, the Oregon courts -- the

14

judgment you are reviewing is a judgment in which the

15

Oregon courts purported to say -- they only referred to

16

Article VII, section 3 in one footnote in Van Lorn.

17

They said, it treats damages as a factual

18

matter, and we recognize that, but that does not prevent

19

us from applying Haslip and looking at the reasonableness

20

of this judgment in light of the policies of this rather

21

detailed statute, and they even said that they would

22

implement the statute by requiring substantial evidence of

23

all its elements.

Oregon has a constitutional provision that on its face, or

MR. TRIBE:

As long as there's some evidence to

Federal Constitution.

I suppose that would be defiance of

the Supremacy Clause.

That would be relatively easy.

MR. TRIBE:

Tribe's last answer shows there is a confusion between

substantive and procedural that's going on here.

Let me give Justice Scalia a case, Blunt v.
Little, which is quoted at page 15 of our brief.
Let me come back to this question which

6

Professor Tribe puts so much weight on about the preÂ­

7

verdict procedure.

8

for unliquidated damages, and somebody asked whether it

There is no such procedure in Oregon

would be fair for this Court to saddle the Oregon courts
10
11

with such a procedure.
If the Oregon courts chose to have such a

12

procedure and gave people notice that it was available,

13

that might satisfy the Constitution, but you could not

14

affirm this decision on the ground that such a procedure

15

exists in Oregon.

16

how they are going to comply with the requirement that

17

there be some judicial review.

18

It's up to the Oregon courts to decide

So you would have to say there has to be some,

1

we send it back, and then the Oregon courts would craft

20

something which may or may not be procedurally adequate to

21

assure fundamental fairness.

QUESTION:

Why isn't there in effect review when

the judge can say, well, my instructions couldn't have

judgment on that basis -- the verdict on that basis?
MR. FREY:

That cannot be done in Oregon.

That

cannot be done in Oregon.
QUESTION:

5

I thought if a judge thought his

6

instructions weren't adequate -- oh, you're saying if the

7

judge thinks the jury didn't understand his instructions,

8

he couldn't order a new trial?
MR. FREY:

9

It's too -- it's -- no.

The

10

instructions would have to be themselves legally erroneous

11

in order to order a new trial, in which case the Oregon

12

supreme court would have the power to enter whatever

13

judgment it wants.

14

QUESTION:

So if a judge in Oregon thinks --

15

MR. FREY:

It doesn't have to even have a jury.

QUESTION:

The judge looked at this jury and

said, this jury really didn't understand what I was

saying, there would be no power to - MR. FREY:

19

That's exactly the problem.

If they

20

concluded that the verdict is in excess of the amount that

21

would be regarded by all reasonable people as the maximum
