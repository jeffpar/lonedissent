ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SENECA:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

This is an Indian case.

What we've got before

13

us is the jurisdiction of the State of Utah over Indians

for purposes of criminal prosecution.

16

presented is whether or not the boundary of the Uintah

17

Reservation was disestablished by a series of

18

congressional enactments beginning in 1902 and culminating

19

in 1905.

20

It comes to the

This case, this issue, has been resolved at one

21

point by an en banc decision of the Tenth Circuit Court of

22

Appeals which was rendered in 1985 that held that the

the Uintah Reservation as established in 1864.

That was a divided vote, wasn't it,

in the Tenth Circuit?

MR. SENECA:

There was a dissent.

8

with possession and distribution of marijuana out of his

9

residence, which was a trailer located in Myton, Utah,

10

which is a small community located within the exterior

11

boundaries of the Uintah Reservation.

appeals court held that the State had not made an

21

appropriate showing that Mr. Hagen was not an Indian, and

22

they also held that the en banc decision of the Tenth

was the law, and therefore they dismissed the charges

Circuit had concluded in the 1985 decision,

14

We have a situation here where the appeal of Mr.

15

Hagen was submerged into the appeal -- the decision of the

supreme court of Mr. Perank,

before this Court is basically a jurisdictional question.

QUESTION:

3

MR. SENECA:

4

QUESTION:

5

Mr. Seneca, you did not represent the

That's correct.
And indeed, you did not represent the

petitioner when the petition for certiorari was filed.

6

MR. SENECA:

7

QUESTION:

That's also correct.
In your brief you rely on collateral

8

estoppel of the State to relitigate this question after

9

the Tenth Circuit decision, but I suppose that can be

10

waived, and for our purposes, isn't it waived as we take

11

the case?

12

MR. SENECA:

What we have put forward for the

13

Court's review is our position and our arguments as to why

14

collateral estoppel should be considered by the Court

15

and - -

16
17

QUESTION:

estoppel as a defense can be waived?

MR. SENECA:

QUESTION:

21

Well, do you agree that collateral

Of course, it can be.
And it certainly wasn't raised in the

cert petition, was it?
MR. SENECA:

I mean, that was -It wasn't raised directly, but

22

everything that surrounded the cert petition talked about

23

collateral estoppel, and the only thing that was not done

24

was the words "collateral estoppel" used.

Well, I don't think you're right on

that, Mr. Seneca.

for certiorari is whether the Uintah and Ouray

of May 27th, 1902 so as to confer criminal jurisdiction

of collateral estoppel.

The question presented in your petition

brief so that you could smuggle in collateral estoppel,

10

but your question presented says nothing about collateral

11

estoppel.

12

MR. SENECA:

Mr. Chief Justice, if I might just

13

bring to the Court's attention that the question presented

14

really focuses on a jurisdictional issue.

15

how it is said, at bottom, the question presented

16

addresses the issue of jurisdiction.

18

QUESTION:

-- it's affirmative defense, it's not

jurisdictional.

19

MR. SENECA:

20

QUESTION:

21

Regardless of

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
What you call collateral estoppel,

issue-preclusion, is an affirmative defense.

22

MR. SENECA:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.
It is not jurisdictional, so I don't

24

understand how this being a jurisdictional question, the

25

jurisdiction of the tribal court versus the State court,

helps you out with an affirmative defense, which it

2

appears you've dropped when you came to this Court.

3

MR. SENECA:

What we've done, Justice Ginsburg,

4

our concern and our view on this is, what we're talking

5

about is the liberty of an individual, and all that we

6

have presented to the Court for its consideration is this

7

defense.

8

that it has not been waived, and it's basically there then

9

for this Court to exercise its judgment on that issue.

We feel, and we've given the reasons why we feel

QUESTION:

10

Even if you were right that you

11

didn't somehow waive it, you recognize that issue

12

preclusion does not operate against the Federal Government

13

the way it would against an individual.

14

and the citizenry the States represent attract any less

15

respect?

Why should States

16

That is, if we don't apply issue preclusion

17

rigidly against the Federal Government, why should we

18

apply it rigidly against the State or local government?

19

MR. SENECA:

The underlying policy on -- for

20

that issue preclusion has to deal with the building up of

21

various positions on issues that may finally come to this

22

Court so that the Court can have the advantage, then, and

23

the understanding of this various Court's working on that

24

issue in bringing it to the Court.

25

In our set of facts, it's site-specific, it's

1

issue-specific, it's not something that's going to recur.

2

This is a one-time kind of issue that this Court would

3

have to deal with, and so the issue-preclusion issue and

4

the policy underlying all of that would not apply in this

5

set of circumstances and to these facts.

6

QUESTION:

All of that suggests a kind of

7

question that we would not grant certiorari on ordinarily,

8

something that is site-specific and fact-specific.

9

issue you present in your petition for certiorari is a

The

10

conflict between the supreme court of Utah and the Tenth

11

Circuit over whether there was a diminution of the

12

reservation.

13

whether the State of Utah might be collaterally estopped

14

in this case.

15

That's quite a separate question from

MR. SENECA:

I don't disagree with the Chief

16

Justice's characterization here that there is a difference

17

involved here.

18

19

going to have to decide whether or not that reservation

20

boundary has been disestablished or not.

All that we're putting forward in this

One of the ways in which this Court can reach

that is to look at the tremendous amount of work that has

level, at the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals level, and

have to address the issue de novo and decide it, do you

Absolutely.
If we have to resolve it de novo?
Yes.
In other words, if you -- if the

MR. SENECA:

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

If all we had before us was the text

MR. SENECA:

Not under the decisions of this

recent decision.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I would have thought there were

5

decisions of the Court that say, language of reverting to

6

the public domain would be treated as diminishing the

7

reservation boundary.

MR. SENECA:

I think that it's clear that that

is certainly evidence of something to be considered, but

is not dispositive of the issue, is not conclusive.

I think it's

a term that is ambiguous at best, at least in these

MR. SENECA:

1

What we have in the historical

context is a position that the Congress has taken in

3

legislative enactments that basically was an assimilation

4

policy that was going to open reservation areas for non-

5

Indian settlement, was going to allot individual Indians

pieces of land, and the whole idea was for them to be

assimilated into the dominant society.

10

And you're saying that allowing white

11

settlers to come onto the reservations would be referred

to as restoring the reservation to the public domain,

13

permitting the entry by white settlers would be described

14

in that fashion with those words?

15

MR. SENECA:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SENECA:

Yes.
I cannot imagine that.
We have the position that was taken

18

in the line of cases that has come before this Court.

19

What we have --we have those cases where those

reservations have been diminished:

5

QUESTION:

There was never any agreement by

Is my recollection correct that the

6

operative provisions of the 1902 act were conditioned on

7

that agreement, so that the act in which the public

8

domain, reversion to public domain language occurred, was

9

never itself operative to effect anything?

10
11

Isn't that

correct?
MR. SENECA:

That's correct, as the Justice

12

indicated, that it was conditioned upon an agreement with

13

the Ute Indians, and that agreement was never forthcoming.

14

QUESTION:

Well, the later statutes by

themselves didn't do anything, either.

MR. SENECA:

They had to tag

Well, the 1903 and 1904 were

18

basically an extension of time for the opening and

19

additional appropriations to get surveys done, the real

20

operative aspect of the opening heard in the 1905 statute,

21

and the 1905 statute, which was the last of these lines of

22

enactments for the opening of the Uintah Reservation,

23

basically indicated that the entry would be under the

24

general homestead and town site laws, and so the --

1

reversion to public domain?

2

MR. SENECA:

Not in the 1905 statute.

3

So what we have, then, is a set of circumstances

4

where the language that was set forth in the Solem v.

5

Bartlett case, where this Court indicated that

6

diminishment will not be lightly inferred; our analysis of

7

surplus land acts requires that Congress clearly evinced

8

an attempt to change boundaries before diminishment will

9

be found, and so the issue and the test has to deal with

10

what was the congressional intent in dealing with this

11

diminishment, or with the reservation boundary of the

12

Uintah Reservation?
Now, the Tenth Circuit in their analysis of

13
14

going through this voluminous record that was before the

15

Court at that time found that there was no clear

16

expression by the Congress to diminish the Uintah

17

Reservation, and it's our position that nothing has

18

changed.

19

The facts of the Uintah Reservation haven't

20

changed, and as I was discussing this issue with

21

Mr. Hagen, and as we were reviewing this, we got to

22

thinking about the various elements involved in

23

diminishment cases.

24
25

The most recent position that this Court has set
forward is the Solem case.

There has been nothing since

that time.
QUESTION:

May I just ask a general question?

3

Is it your position that the tribe retains the power to

4

exclude people from the reservation?

MR. SENECA:

One of the elements of sovereignty

6

is to be able to exclude undesirables from the

reservation.

MR. SENECA:

MR. SENECA:

No, they could not.
Why not, if it's a -Because those people that have come

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. MANN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS

6

AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

9

The question before the Court is whether the

10

provisions of the 1902 and 1905 acts that opened portions

11

of the Uintah Indian Reservation to settlement by non-

12

Indians operated to exclude from the reservation the lands

13

that were opened to settlement.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, let me ask you the same

15

question that I asked Mr. Seneca.

16

us is the language of the 1902 act, speaking of

17

restoration to the public domain, if land had been

18

restored, would the reservation boundary be excluded, in

19

your view?

20

Seymour case, and DeCoteau, and some of the others?

21

If all we have before

Was that language clear enough under the

MR. MANN:

We think it's quite clear that the

22

language would not have been sufficient to alter the

23

boundaries of the reservation.

24

QUESTION:

25

The Court's decision --

How do you explain away Seymour and

the other cases indicating that that language is

sufficient?
MR. MANN:

I don't think that those cases do

3

indicate that the language is sufficient.

4

of take you through the cases where this Court has

5

referred to public domain language in statutes affecting

6

reservations, the statute at issue in Seymour actually had

7

also been considered by the Court in an earlier case,

8

United States v. Pelican in 1914, but in both cases the

9

key thing to realize is that the statute does not simply

If I could sort

10

say that the land is being restored to the public domain.

11

It states that the reservation is being vacated and

12

restored to the public domain.

13

our mind carries much more of a connotation of surrender,

14

or cession of the type that has been required in this

15

Court's later decisions, so that doesn't really seem to us

16

to speak to this issue directly.

17

QUESTION:

Now, the word vacate in

I would think that that phrase hurts

18

your case rather than helps it.

It shows that restored to

19

the public domain means being taken away from the

20

reservation.

MR. MANN:

Well, no, actually --

MR. MANN:

1

Well, it suggests that the

2

reservation is being vacated, and there are a number of

3

things that can happen when the reservation is vacated.

4

In this particular instance, the land is being restored to

5

the public domain.

6

I think that the clearest description --

7

QUESTION:

What does that mean, though, and

8

restored to the public domain?

9

in that context?
MR. MANN:

10

What do you think it means

Well, the clearest explanation the

11

Court has given in this context is in footnote 17 of the

12

opinion in Solem, where the Court indicated that the

13

phrase could well have referred to the fact that the lands

14

were being made available for sale to non-Indians.

15

The reference to public lands in Federal

16

statutes has traditionally referred to lands that are

17

available for sale as opposed to lands owned by the United

18

States that had been set aside for some other use, and

19

that's what the Court in the Solem case referred to.

20

The -- stated that a reference to public domain in this

21

context was perfectly consistent with a continuing

22

reservation status.
There's no reason why lands could not be within

23
24

an Indian reservation and be available for sale to non-

25

Indians.

That's the exact thing that happened in each of

this Court's cases involving surplus land acts in which

2

the Court held a reservation was not diminished.

3

QUESTION:

And you say that that's the meaning

4

of restored to the public domain, land on reservation

5

which is available for purchase to non-Indians is referred

6

to as public domain.

7

MR. MANN:

It doesn't matter whether it's on a

8

reservation or not, but the phrase, public domain, could

9

be understood to refer to lands that are owned by the

10

United States that are available for sale.
QUESTION:

11

Do you have any instance where -- you

12

say it could be.

Do you have any instances where it has

13

been, other than this statute?

MR. MANN:

The statute at issue in Solem, that's

what the Court indicated the most likely understanding

of the -QUESTION:

That wasn't the operative language

That was just -MR. MANN:

No, but the Court did hold that the

20

land was on the reservation.

21

Court, and the statute stated the land was in the public

22

domain, so the legal effect of the Solem decision is that

23

land which Congress had described specifically as being in

24

the public domain, albeit offhandedly, but in an act that

25

Congress enacted and the President signed, stated that

that land was in the public domain, and this Court held

2

that it remained on the reservation.

3

QUESTION:

Well, how about the Rosebud case,

4

where the statute said restored to the public domain

5

resulted -MR. MANN:

6

Now, in that case also, you'll -- if

7

you -- when you look at the Rosebud opinion, the statute

8

to which you're referring is not the statute that was at

9

issue before the Court, and the reference occurs in a

10

footnote in the facts statement that described how the

11

Rosebud Sioux Reservation came to the size that was at

12

issue before the 1904, 1907, and 1910 acts, and if you

13

actually look at the statute in that case it becomes

14

fairly clear why the parties before the Court conceded

15

that the statute altered the boundaries of the

16

reservation.
The title of the statute states that its purpose

17
18

is to divide a portion of the reservation of the Sioux

19

Nation into separate reservations and to secure the

20

relinquishment of the Indian title to the remainder.

than those mentioned in the opinion for reaching the

MR. MANN:

Well, the opinion did not necessarily

6

reservation -- that the land in question there has been

7

removed from the reservation, and the Court was simply

8

summarizing the fact that that -- that the land in

9

question was no longer part of the reservation because the

The parties conceded that the

10

Great Sioux Reservation no longer existed, and what

11

remained was the Rosebud Sioux Reservation at issue in the

12

case.

13

And then the Court went on to consider whether

14

the Rosebud Sioux Reservation had been diminished by the

15

statutes at issue there, so we think that was adequately

16

explained by the fact that the parties would have had no

17

possible basis for suggesting the reservation continued in

18

existence in light of the clear purpose of the statute at

19

hand.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, in deciding whether the

21

public domain language could mean what you claim it does

22

mean, I suppose we look to intent, and there was a

23

reference to congressional intent a moment ago.

24

conclusion that was stated was that there was no sort of

25

specific indication, specific to the statutes involved

The

here, of congressional intent.

2

Isn't it fair to say, however, that if we look

3

further into the state of the congressional enactments at

4

the time of the 1902, 3, 4, 5 acts, that there was very

5

clearly a policy of the United States, an indication of

6

the policy of the United States in effect to end the

7

reservation system, and shouldn't we read the language in

8

light of that broader policy?

9

MR. MANN:

Well, this Court has had a number of

10

cases that have considered surplus land acts from this

11

period of time, and I think it's fair to say that --

12

QUESTION:

And we declined to do that --

MR. MANN:

-- in all --â¢ in all --

QUESTION:

-- but were we right, or were we

MR. MANN:

No, I think you were right, because

15
16

wrong?

17

the -- what's going on here is, the question of whether

18

reservation boundaries were going to be altered at the

19

time had little practical significance, because the

20

question of criminal jurisdiction turned on the definition

21

of Indian country, which at the time turned solely on who

22

owned the land, so when Congress opened the land to

23

settlement by non-Indians, by that very action it was

24

removing at the time the land from jurisdiction.

25

didn't have to consider whether it was going to alter the

reservation boundaries.
Now, what the Court has done is, it's assumed

3

that if Congress intended to alter reservation boundaries,

4

typically Congress would have stated so specifically, and

5

it's looked very closely to the language of the statutes,

6

and it has had a number of statutes where Congress has

7

quite clearly stated that it intended to alter the

8

boundaries of reservation, and those statutes appear in

9

DeCoteau and Rosebud, and if you look at them, they quite

10

clearly state more or less that the land is being ceded,

11

surrendered, and conveyed, and the Indians are --

12

QUESTION:

Well, certainly, saying more or less

13

is really something of an understatement, because I don't

14

recall in either of those cases that the language said, we

15

intend to alter the boundary of the reservation.

16

MR. MANN:

Well, the language in DeCoteau said

17

that the Indians cede, sell, relinquish and convey to the

18

United States all their claim, right, title, and interest

19

in the land in question, and the statute in Rosebud stated

20

that the Indians cede, surrender, grant, and convey to the

21

United States all their claim, right, title, and interest

22

in and to all the land in question.

23

It would be rather difficult, I think, to

24

construe that language as language that allowed the

25

Indians to retain sovereignty over the land.

1

I think you're probably right, but

to -- I wouldn't say that to -- it is paraphrasing the

language you just quoted to say, Congress says we intend

MR. MANN:

I think it is paraphrasing the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN GRAHAM

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MS. GRAHAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin my argument by focusing on the

19

point that was just raised by Justice Souter, and that is

20

that whether or not the term "cession" or "cede" as was

21

used in some of the cases that have been before the Court

22

is less explicit than a congressional mandate that is

23

conceded in this act to be, these lands shall be restored

24

to the public domain.

25

It is the State of Utah's position that in fact

1

that is the result of the cede language.

In fact, it's

2

interesting to point out that though the term "cession"

3

was used in the statute in the DeCoteau case that this

4

Court decided in 1975, the United States in that case

5

argued against the effectiveness of that term and, in

6

fact, their statement was in their brief that the term --

7

use of the term "cession" in that statute was ineffective,

8

because the heading in the brief stated, "The absence of

9

language in the 1891 act expressly altering the boundaries

10

of the reservation or returning the land to the public

11

domain shows that the reservation boundaries were not

12

altered."

13

I'd like -QUESTION:

Your trouble in this case is, isn't

14

it, that nothing in fact was operative until the 1905 act,

15

and the 1905 act rather conspicuously omitted the

16

reference to returning to the public domain?

17

MS. GRAHAM:

I don't think that is our problem

18

in this case, Your Honor.

I know that has been argued,

19

but I think it's very clear that the 1902 act provided

what was in Rosebud the unmistakable baseline intent to

diminish these surplus lands.

happened, and that was that this Court rendered its

that consent was no longer needed in the negotiations with

the Indians.

19

The 1903 act that governed this Uintah

reservation and was an amendment to the 1902 act quickly

21

made that change pursuant to Lone Wolf, pursuant to that

decision, and changed the statute to say basically we'd

forthcoming, go ahead and assign the allotments, and that

But 1902 still provided the two key-

2

congressional mandates that were needed to accomplish the

only purpose of this law, too -- to assign allotments to

the Indians, and to open the surplus lands to non-Indian

settlers.
Those two key mandates were only provided in the

6

7

1902 act.

They were never provided in any of the three

8

extension acts that simply delayed the time for opening

9

the reservation for 1 year.
The fact that the public domain language was not

12

other two extensions, either, the two mandates about

MS. GRAHAM:

QUESTION:

Both ways.

But it's very clear --

And if you accept that, then the 1903

3

amendment it seems to me doesn't really reach the more

4

difficult question of whether Indian consent was still

5

required for the unallotted lands.

6

MS. GRAHAM:

I think that question is

7

specifically answered in a. later statute, Your Honor, and

8

that was that initially the Uintah and White River bands

9

were going to be paid $70,000 by the United States for

10

allotments that were coming, really, from the

11

Uncompahgres, who had been given the opportunity to pick

12

allotments there as well.

13

And initially, I believe in the 1902 Joint

14

Resolution from the Congress, it was stated that they'll

15

get their money when the consent that was referred to in

16

the 1902 act is forthcoming.

17

the 1903 act, I believe, that the Indians would not -- or,

18

excuse me, that the Indians would not have to wait for

19

their money until they consented to the restoration of the

20

lands to the public domain, so I think that makes it clear

21

that really the consent was probably seen as related to

22

both, and was removed as to both.

It is expressly repeated in the presidential proclamation

that really opened these lands in 1905 by President

4

Roosevelt, and it's the first line of that proclamation.

5

It states very simply that whereas the 1902 act provided

6

that these surplus lands were going to be restored to the

7

public domain, so be it, and went on to discuss the

8

particulars of how that would be done and the registration

process and so forth.

10

Well, General Graham, what weight do

11

you think we should give to the presidential proclamation

12

on the question before us, that is, the congressional

13

intent?

14

MS. GRAHAM:

The Court has looked to it before

15

in these diminishment cases, Your Honor, that have been

16

rendered here, and in fact I think the United States

17

argued in one of the cases that it was the most probative

as to what the act of Congress meant that he himself was

going to implement by opening.

Ms. Graham, if the congressional

commit criminal acts in this area, this area that for

70 years has really not been considered part of the

I think the way

honest, these surplus land acts are very difficult to
discern.

As Justice Souter correctly noted, really the

environment, the congressional intent at this time was all
these reservation would be -- the surplus lands would be
restored to the public domain.
So I think they're considered unique, and
perhaps -- and I think the Solem court calls that factor
an unorthodox factor but an important one, and the warning
given there was, we look to the subsequent demographics as

one indication of what Congress may have intended, but the
warning there is, to impose reservation status on lands

3

that were settled, populated by non-Indians, poses a great

burden on the administration of law enforcement there, and

I wanted to address briefly another major
difference between the Solem result and the one that the

public domain language.

13

key congressional mandate in the act, along with, of

course, the allotment to the Indians.

Here, the fact that the surplus

sell-and-dispose statute, like the one this Court

18

addressed in the Mattz case, and in fact the only

19

reference to public domain, they were literally the last

20

two words of the last section of the act, and that section

21

had only to do with timber rights.

22

So we don't believe that the Solem's balancing

can really match up against what is in the first line of

we think those were the two major differences that
describe -- that explain the difference in the result.
I also want to address the concern that Justice
Souter raised about whether or not the public domain
mandate had been somehow repealed by not being included in
the 1905 act, because that was the last extension act
before President Roosevelt did open the lands up.
You know, the argument here really is that that
phrase was repealed by the inclusion of the homestead and
townsite restriction, and in fact the argument I believe
that the tribe makes is that the homestead and townsite
restriction is so inconsistent with the language of
restored to the public domain that they couldn't possibly
exist together, and therefore the latter must have
repealed the prior.
The State of Utah strongly disagrees, and in
fact the homestead and townsite manner of disposing,
selling the lands was the most typical way to deal with
the lands when they were restored to the public domain.
Of course, it was the specific device used to restore
these lands to the public domain in the Rosebud case.
I think really critical for this Court to
take -- to be aware of at this point on the point of the
effect of the 1905 act, and did it repeal that mandate in
the 1902 act, is really what the United States and the Ute

the most probative has to be the statutory language, and I
just have to say for the State of Utah, Your Honor, that
we think we have the clearest possible case, and that is,
when you have in the first line a mandate that the lands
are going to be restored to the public domain, and in fact
that the presidential proclamation that implements it

with the proclamation, because it had to occur at the same

time as the allotment process.

The way it was set up was the Indians were given

QUESTION:

3

MS. GRAHAM:

That's a fair reading of it.
-- there's much support for that,

4

at least in the cases that -- the ones that this Court has

5

treated a directive, an operative directive of "shall be

6

restored to the public domain" as fairly clear, and even

7

though sometimes -- and, in fact, a lot of the parties in

8

the long history of this litigation have pointed to

9

language, well, those lands are -- those are the

10

reservation lands, or -- there is a reservation there, a

11

big one, 1.2 million acres, and we have often tried to

12

argue that just because there's a reservation to lands

13

being on a reservation doesn't mean that another small

14

part of it isn't removed from the reservation when it's

15

opened to settlement by non-Indians, because of course the

16

reservation, the trust lands that are there now are

17

unchallenged by the State and, of course, always have

18

been.

19

The argument -- I wanted to just complete the

20

thought about the effect of the stipulation that the

21

United States and the tribe entered into, only that after

22

it's said expressly -- and I would like to note that this

23

express stipulation was adopted by the court and the court

24

of claims expressly held that the 1902 act and acts

25

amending it did, in fact, restore those surplus lands to

the public domain.
Two paragraphs down in that stipulation, at
paragraph 19, the tribe and the United States discussed
the homestead device, if you will, of opening the lands,
and found absolutely nothing inconsistent with the public
domain concept.
There really is only one case that has ever held
that a congressional mandate, an operative phrase in a
surplus land act restoring those surplus lands to the
public domain did not affect removal from the reservation,
and that, of course, is the Tenth Circuit decision, the en
banc decision in 1985.
I must say to this Court that I think that
opinion is a confused opinion.

I think it completely

misstated this Court's holding in the Solem case, and
the -- at two points in the case it talks about public
domain language does affect the wholesale diminishment,
and when it's used for the Gilsonite removal it's of
course completely clear, and in two other parts of the
opinion it says,

"Our conclusion is this language does not

affect the disestablishment," and in fact in the
concurring opinion Justice Seymour says that yes, public
domain language used to be an indicator of diminishment,
Solem dictates a different result.
We think that is clearly not the case.
