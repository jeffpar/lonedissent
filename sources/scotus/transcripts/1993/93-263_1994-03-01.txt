ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. JENCKS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. JENCKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case raises the issue of the scope of a

11
12

Federal court's power to enforce a settlement agreement

13

reached in a case before it.

14

is whether the district court properly invoked its

15

inherent power in enforcing the settlement agreement in

16

this case where the action was no longer pending, having

17

been dismissed months previous, where the action was not

18

incorporated or made a part of any court order or

19

otherwise given judicial -QUESTION:

20
21

incorporated.

23

You say the action wasn't

What you mean is the agreement, don't you?

MR. JENCKS:

22

Specifically, the question

Yeah.

Excuse me.

Thank you,

Mr. --

QUESTION:

25

MR. JENCKS:

And it was not a written agreement?
That's correct.

This was an -- let

law claims.

This originally was a case filed in State

It was removed on diversity grounds on account of

6

3 days into the trial of this matter, the

7

parties reached a settlement which, at the insistence of

8

the respondent, was not converted to a formal settlement

agreement.

Approximately 5 weeks later the case was

10

dismissed unconditionally under 41(a)(1), and the parties

11

went their separate ways, only 4 or 5 months after that to

12

come to a major disagreement over the terms of the

13

settlement and who was breaching what terms.

14

respondent sought its remedy back before the Federal

15

court, and the petitioner sought his remedy before the

State court.

This was an

way?
MR. JENCKS:

It was summarized by one of the

encouraging the settlement.

2

for that recitation, the summarization in chambers, never

3

made a part of the record or otherwise incorporated into

4

an order of the court.

5

But it was never -- except

We have proposed, as have the 10 States who

6

filed an amicus brief, a rule of practice, as it were, a

7

line where we suggest the constitutional concerns of the

8

limited jurisdiction of Federal courts are met, and that

9

also serves an important function as a rule of practice.

10

QUESTION:

Well, do you argue

that application

11

of the Federal rules themselves means if you just follow

12

the rules, that there is no right to come in later for

13

enforcement?

14

MR. JENCKS:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

I don't

15

think the Federal rules confer jurisdiction in this case,

16

with the single exception -- and it really doesn't confer

17

jurisdiction, but Rule 60 would allow, under the proper

18

circumstances and a showing --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. JENCKS:

21

QUESTION:

But that wasn't resorted to here.
It was not resorted to here.
So do you take the position that if

22

you just follow the rules, the court had no authority to

23

enforce this judgment?

MR. JENCKS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
But on your -5

3

QUESTION:

Then if that were the case, we

wouldn't reach any constitutional question.
MR. JENCKS:

The only -- the constitutional

4

question arises from the district court deciding to

5

exercise its inherent jurisdiction to enforce this

6

settlement.

7

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, but we can solve it by just

saying the rules don't allow it.
MR. JENCKS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Well, rules, strictly speaking, I

11

suppose, can't confer jurisdiction.

12

confer jurisdiction.

13

Then what you're saying here, I suppose, is that there's

14

no independent basis for Federal jurisdiction and the

15

judicial code.

16

MR. JENCKS:

17

QUESTION:

It's statutes that

A rule could implement a statute.

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.
But are you not also saying that

18

there is no juris -- there would be no jurisdictional

19

problem if a Rule 60 motion had been filed here and the

20

other side had been -- had asked to be relieved from the

21

burden of the judgment?

22

MR. JENCKS:

If either party contesting the

23

terms had made a motion that was granted, under the

24

standards of Rule 60 the dismissal could have been vacated

25

and the case could have been restored to the docket.

QUESTION:

1

All right, now if the case had been

2

restored to the docket, would you then take the position

3

that the court could not consider your settlement and that

4

the only thing the court could do would be to litigate the

5

case?

6

MR. JENCKS:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

Yes.
And that being on a jurisdictional

basis or on the text of the rules?
MR. JENCKS:

Both on the text of the rules, but

10

also on a practical basis.

In most settlements reached,

11

the dismissal of the action is obviously one of the major

12

elements of consideration.

13

settlement for some fraud in its procurement or other

14

reason and can convince a court that to let it stand and

15

not vacate it would perpetrate some extreme hardship or

16

great injustice, to fall under Rule 60.

If you were unfolding the

17

And I want to -- Rule 60 I don't believe is available

18

for every breach of a settlement agreement that may occur.

19

I think it -- its history, its usage, its application, we

20

can assume it to be a much more of a reserved --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. JENCKS:

Well, would it be available here?
I don't believe so under the facts,

23

even, that the district court found of the breach, of the

24

alleged breach of the settlement agreement.

25

the motion -7

Had they made

QUESTION:

What more would you have needed?

Are

2

there any set of facts that you can imagine in which Rule

3

60 could have been invoked here properly?

4

MR. JENCKS:

Certainly, I think there could be

5

cases where either there was a clear fraud in the

6

procurement of the settlement, or perhaps a changed

7

circumstance.

8

this case was a change in State law that makes one of the

9

terms of the settlement --

10
11
12

For example, something that has happened in

QUESTION:

But mere breach of settlement would

never be sufficient under Rule 60?
MR. JENCKS:

I don't think -- I guess the

13

circumstance of the parties could be such, that would be

14

the only way to avoid great hardship.

15

generally, simple breach of a settlement agreement would

16

not qualify for a Rule 60 setaside.

17

QUESTION:

But I think,

Mr. Jencks, I'm not sure I understand

18

how you say the constitutional question can be avoided.

19

It seems to me if neither the rules nor the statute

20

provide for this kind of jurisdiction, the argument is

21

still going to be made, and is made by your adversary

22

here, that it doesn't have to be in the statute or in the

23

rules; that the court has it by virtue of the

24

Constitution, automatically; there is an inherent

25

authority under the Constitution.

Isn't that question in

this case, no matter what we say about the rule -MR. JENCKS:

2

The question of the scope of

3

inherent jurisdiction here is this case, because I think

4

we are prepared to concede that there is such a thing as

5

inherent jurisdiction, and in some situations it may apply

6

to the enforcement of settlement agreements.

that is exactly --

give it judicial sanction, you can access one of the

13

bedrock principles of inherent jurisdiction where the

exercise of the inherent power is indispensable, is

essential to the performance of the power formally

16

granted.

QUESTION:

Because if you take a

But we have to consider that

question, don't we, whether the inherent power under the

Constitution covers this?

MR. JENCKS:

Absolutely, Your Honor, and I

apologize if I indicated we didn't.
QUESTION:

What is that inherent power again?

talking about?

view a proper scope of inherent jurisdiction, it would be

the power to vindicate and enforce the court's own orders.

outstanding here is an order dismissing the case.

MR. JENCKS:

That's right, and that's why we

11

That's all -- that's the only order

we have.

That's right.

QUESTION:

So the inherent power to enforce an

order of dismissal is what we're talking about.

MR. JENCKS:

I think -- excuse me, Justice

Stevens.

a proper application under Rule 60, the order of

15

dismissal.

16

I think the court has the power to vacate, upon

QUESTION:

Yeah, but I think you just -- you

17

suggested earlier we're not talking about vacating a

18

judgment and going forward with the preceding lawsuit.

They are rather seeking to enforce a separate agreement

that resulted in dismissal of the lawsuit, and they're

suing for enforcement of that agreement.

6

MR. JENCKS:

Maybe you misunderstood -I know you're not -- that's not -I'm not quite sure of the

No, Justice Stevens, I apologize.

7

Let me -- the issue -- I was talking about our proposed

8

rule that tried to access a well established principle for

9

the exercise of inherent jurisdiction that would anchor

10

this enforcement mechanism constitutionally and in a way

11

that's supported by existing authority.

12

It's really in some ways the counterpart to this

13

Court's addressing the discipline or sanctions side in

14

Chambers, in the Chambers decision, where the need to

15

access or discharge a disciplinary function is essential

16

or viewed as essential to the court's maintenance of the

17

order of its proceedings and the conduct of its business.

18

I think much the same thing can be said about the inherent

19

power necessary to enforce and vindicate orders that have

20

been given judicial sanction by the court.

21

QUESTION:

Well, suppose in this case there had

22

been a motion to reopen the judgment under Rule 60, and

23

the court then had said there are problems with this

24

settlement agreement and so I am now going to enter a new

25

judgment which incorporates the settlement agreement and

constitutional limitations on jurisdiction, why does that

depend on the consent of both parties?
MR. JENCKS:

12

As I under -- I believe I

understood you to ask if -- could the court simply on its

14

own, sua sponte, take the parties' agreement, regardless

15

of their consent, and incorporate it in the judgment of

the court.

still another question?

Pursuant to such an understanding

2

with the judgment incorporated in -- I mean, with the

3

terms of the settlement agreement incorporated in the

judgment, it seems to me that the judgment could do one of

5

two things.

enforcement.

retaining jurisdiction?
QUESTION:

No, without such a statement.

If it

retains jurisdiction expressly, of course it's easily,

like any - and most decrees such a recital.

17

question is supposing there's no such recital in the

Do you have a

1

MR. JENCKS:

My position would be that the

2

existence of the judgment could confer jurisdiction.

3

There may be, depending on the detail, enforceability

4

problems in terms of the rest of it, but there would be

5

jurisdiction if the judgment was, in fact, entered and

6

given judicial sanction.

7

QUESTION:

I'm having a similar difficulty, I

8

guess, and I'd like to go back to your answer to Justice

9

Kennedy's questions, which I don't think I understood.

10

Is -- I think you said that if we assume the moment after

11

the Rule 60 motion is granted, the prior judgment, silent

12

as to any settlement and so on, silent with respect, in

13

fact, to anything except the dismissal, has been vacated.

14

I think you said that if the parties then said, in effect,

15

"Look, Judge, we're having trouble sort of administering

16

our settlement and we would like to put that on the record

17

and make that a part of the judgment," there would be no

18

jurisdictional problem in your view.

19

MR. JENCKS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. JENCKS:

Is that right?

If the court -It's done by consent, in other words.
If the court -- I don't think

parties can privately necessarily contract for

jurisdiction, but upon judicial scrutiny and his entry,

24

that could -- would be done.

problem in doing that.
MR. JENCKS:

3

I don't believe there would be a

jurisdictional problem.

4

QUESTION:

Okay.

Why then is there a

5

jurisdictional problem when they don't consent to that and

one party simply says we had a settlement; I want to prove

to you what the settlement was; I want you then to embody

that settlement in a judgment or at least enforce it now?

several questions where it's been assumed that there is a

Well, that may be right in another

But we would submit that what actually

happened in this case is, in fact, the constructive

not written in a separate document, but it is contained in

agreement was not read by one party.

You asked the question earlier
It was

It was a negotiation process by both parties and

Mr. Kokkonen, was also involved in the colloquy on the

That's -- that is correct.
Do you -- suppose your opponent is

correct that there was nothing here to reopen -- that

there was nothing here to enforce, because all there was

was a dismissal with prejudice, do you think you could go

under Rule 60(b)(6) and reopen the judgment because?

11

You're not alleging fraud; what would be the reason that

you could give if you were proceeding under 60(b)?
MR. MORRIS:

13

Well, Your Honor, I think we would

14

have available to us not only 60(b)(6), but 60(b)(3).

Because if it's not fraud -- and it might be -- it

You have no statutory rules -Not in the narrow -- perhaps the

23

most frequently today encountered phrase -- use of the

24

phrase, ancillary jurisdiction, that is absolutely

25

correct.

QUESTION:

1

Well, you say that Judge Coyle had

2

the authority to enforce his order.

3

dismiss the case.

4

MR. MORRIS:

His only order was to

Well, we believe that what he did

5

here, in effect, with the substantial proceedings in

6

chambers and his participation, that we had, in effect, a

7

much -- a broader order than the narrow stipulation which

8

is all that is on -- entered on the docket, the narrow

9

stipulation in his order dismissing the case.
But we would take the view that in this case --

10
11

and we believe this case, frankly, presents somewhat

12

unique facts, and that on these facts we were entitled to

3

have what Judge Coyle did and what the Ninth Circuit also

4

found appropriate.

5

when we brought the motion to enforce in this matter, we

6

were proceeding in a circuit that said that's all you need

7

to do.

9

We would also observe that, of course,

QUESTION: Well, surely there's a parole evidence
rule of some sort with respect to orders in judgment.

You

20

say that it isn't in writing, but somehow it hovers around

21

the written word.

22

the -- particularly in dealing with a jurisdictional

23

matter, that you look not merely to what's written, but to

24

all the circumstances that kind of led up to it.

25

I don't know that we've ever said that

that, in fact, we essentially have the writing of the

2

agreement here.

3

And contrary to the suggestion, both parties --

4

The writing is the reporter's transcript.

QUESTION:

But nobody doubts --no one is

5

claiming that there was no agreement here.

6

argument the other side makes is since there was no

7

reservation of jurisdiction, that it can't be enforced in

8

Federal court.

9

MR. MORRIS:

I -- the

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but our

10

view of that is on these facts there is ancillary

11

jurisdiction.

12

this country, the courts have, on selected occasions, used

13

ancillary jurisdiction to see to it that prior judgments

14

have not been misused, inequitably used.

15

That going back to the earliest years of

QUESTION:

Ancillary to what?

I mean you can

16

have jurisdiction ancillary to a case that's before you,

17

but once this case has been dismissed without any

18

reservation of continuing jurisdiction, there's nothing to

19

be ancillary to.

20

MR. MORRIS:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

Well -The court has --no longer has a case

in front of it.
MR. MORRIS:

Well, Justice Scalia, we would

24

respectfully suggest that there are a number of instances,

25

as cited in our brief, where this Court has said that if

there was once proper jurisdiction in the Federal courts,

2

there can be ancillary jurisdiction based on that original

3

prior Federal court jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

4
5

For example, what case do you have in

mind?
MR. MORRIS:

6

Well, the cases where -- they come

7

in a number of varieties.

8

judgments entered, the cases went off the books, and

9

where -- in one of the principal cases that we cite, the

The cases where there were

10

Julian v. Central Trust -- the court, in aid of its prior

11

decree in a mortgage foreclosure situation and when there

12

was going to be a State court action that called into

13

question the transfer of the property in that case,

15

We have cases in a variety of circumstances

where the courts --

QUESTION:

The court has authority to enforce

its orders.

But here there isn't anything other than a

bare dismissal with prejudice.
MR. MORRIS:

20

Well, we have attorney's fees

21

cases, Justice Ginsburg, where the case is dismissed but

22

the court, after the dismissal, deals with the attorney's

23

fees.

and the court deals with the contempt.

QUESTION:

2

Have you had -- I'm -- what is the

contempt case you have, where after a case is dismissed a

4

party is held in contempt for violating --

5

MR. MORRIS:

Well, the action that would be the

6

basis occurred -- would have occurred, certainly, Justice

7

Stevens, during the live period of the case before the

8

court.

But in many instances -- in some instances, at

least, the addressing of the contempt and whether
10

punishment is warranted and what punishment would be

11

warranted may be done after the dismissal of the

12

substantive case wherein the contempt was committed.

13
14

And so too with attorney's fees issues.

The

substantive case may have gone away --

15

QUESTION:

But are there any cases in which

16

action taken after the case is dismissed provides the

17

basis for contempt of court?

there?

that could not have been granted by an -- a provision the

court could not have ordered as relief in the case?
For example, say your client had settled and

said I'll move to San Francisco so I won't compete with

those matters which would be properly --

QUESTION:

15

MR. MORRIS:

QUESTION:

Proper relief in the case.
Proper relief in the case.
And you would argue in this case

17

everything that was agreed to was something the judge

18

could have ordered?

19

MR. MORRIS:

20

It's relatively simple.

Yes, absolutely.
Really, there are only

21

a couple of provisions: that he would turn back over to

22

the Guardian various files that he had improperly

23

retained, and that he would not act as a representative in

24

seeking information on behalf of continuing clients of

his.

that was -- those were the essential terms ultimately

agreed to after the intervention.

wouldn't you, because you didn't move for that originally?

7

-- not for 60(b)(6), but you'd be too late,

MR. MORRIS:

It may be or it may not be.

The

8

reason I say may not be, under the normal reading of the

9

rule we have a 1 -- we would have a 1-year period to seek

10

60(b) (3) relief.

11

because of the ensuing litigation and the California

12

doctrines of equitable tolling, whether there may be an

13

argument that the continuing litigation in this matter

14

provides a basis where the 1-year period would have been

15

considered to be tolled.

16

I do not know, however, for sure whether

QUESTION:

Or that you could treat your original

17

motion for enforcement as though it were a 60(b)(3)

18

motion.

19

MR. MORRIS:

And we would suggest more than

20

that, Justice Ginsburg, that, in fact, our original motion

21

to enforce, appropriate under the Ninth Circuit law at the

22

time, did all that a 60(b)(3) motion could have done.

23

put the petitioner on notice that he had to defend.

24

told him what we believed the actions at issue were, and

it told him what we were seeking in the case.

60(b) in your motion?

MR. MORRIS:

QUESTION:

5
6

Did you make any reference to Rule

No, Your Honor, we did not.
Then it would be a rather strange

thing to treat it as a Rule 60(b) motion.
MR. MORRIS:

Well, there are cases cited in our

7

brief and Professor Morris' treatise that say Rule 60 is

8

to be liberally construed, and there is some authority for

9

treating it liberally.

And we would suggest that it would

10

not be so strange where every real function that 60 (b) is

11

intended to serve was met by our action with the motion to

12

enforce, which was the motion under the law of the circuit

13

that was appropriate.

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, 60(b) is addressed to the

discretion of the trial judge, is it not?

16

MR. MORRIS:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And a motion to enforce, I take it,

18

would not be.

enforced, it isn't up to the trial judge to decide, well,

20

I don't think I will enforce this, or perhaps I will

enforce it.

If you have a right to have a settlement

If we're proceeding under Rule 60,

that's -- I believe that would be correct.

There the discretion is has the district court's

involvement in the case, has the utilization of the

4

Federal resources been such that it makes sense that the

5

court, though having jurisdiction, should choose whether

6

to entertain the enforcement or whether not to entertain

7

it.
And so in the ancillary area, it is our view

8

9

that the court, though having jurisdiction to enforce our

motion -- to entertain our motion, did not necessarily

11

have to.

12

majority of cases district court judges are likely,

probably, not to.

kinds of circumstances where a settlement may have

occurred, and you could say some of them will be right

after a demand letter and a draft complaint.

entertain a motion to enforce in that circumstance is

virtually nil.

no reason to get invested in the enforcement in that

Mr. Morris, can I give you an example

that's based on many years ago that I bumped into many

and enforcing this decree.

Are you telling me that in all

10

of those settlements that provision was really

unnecessary?

No.

QUESTION:

It, of course, is a classic

Oh, I agree.
And I was one of them.

MR. MORRIS:

Well, I think the better, prudent

practice would be to do so, and certainly in a consent

district court role in enforcing the terms of a consent

district court here are highly unusual in the way that the

district court and in the Ninth Circuit where, despite the

3

failure to reserve jurisdiction, parties were able to

4

enforce a settlement agreement that was not incorporated

in the judgment?

6

MR. MORRIS:

Well, there are cases that we have

7

cited in our brief where dismissals have been set aside

8

and where settlement agreements that have been breached

9

were enforced by the district courts.

This is not a

10

completely sui generis case in that sense.

11

certainly no precedent in this Court that addresses this

12

particular case and clearly states that there is ancillary

jurisdiction or constructive -- or constructively the

compliance with Rule 60 in this particular circumstance.

There's no precedent here.

No, I do not believe it is our

exclusive remedy.

I believe we could have gone -- that we

21

could have gone to State court, but that would have been a

22

stranger forum, whereas Judge Coyle had been so heavily

23

involved in seeing this agreement come together, in making

sure that he and the parties both understood it, and in

telling the parties that if there was an enforcement

about the fact that he said I don't want to see you back

MR. MORRIS:

Well, that's an interesting --

At Joint Appendix page 81 he said, I must find

you've agreed to, and for that reason he brought up one

didn't believe that there was a mistake.

17

anticipate that we would have the problem, but that

18

problem did, in very short order, emerge.

19

the settlement was reached in chambers on the record.

20

In -- by April -- by early April --we had the dismissal

21

order April 13th and we had breach in April, and we were

22

back with our motion to enforce -- there's no long lapse

23

of time here.

One of the suggestions that's made is, well, you
can have a long lapse of time.

We were before Judge Coyle

again with a motion filed on May 21st, and we were in

2

hearing before him on June 29th, all these dates of 1992.

3

So from the date of the agreement, March 5th, until Judge

4

Coyle held our hearing, it was March 5th to June 29th.

5

That's the modest timeframe that's involved here.

6

There will be other cases where the timeframe is

7

grossly different and where the district court judge there

8

will rightly choose not to exercise his or her discretion,

9

but we don't believe that this is a case where that's a

10

problem.
QUESTION:

11

I guess this means that a district

12

judge can't avoid getting himself entangled in the future

13

disputes of a settlement agreement,

14

I mean it's sort of nice to know the district judge, if he

15

thinks it's a pretty simple settlement that he can police,

16

just put it in his judgment order.

17

doesn't, he is enmeshed in whatever the parties have

18

agreed to, and they can keep coming back and bothering him

19

about it and saying --

But you say even if he

QUESTION:

MR. MORRIS:

Why isn't it?
In rare circumstances, the facts of

the district court's involvement will justify the district

court judge making the determination.

yes, ancillary jurisdiction, some of it is discretionary,

choices, for whatever business purposes, confidentiality

I think there's a difference

14

whether we choose -- whether either of the parties chooses

15

to go back on a 60(b) motion to reopen the previous

proceedings, or to enforce the settlement agreement.

17

Counsel -- the enforcement of the settlement agreement may

there's a State brief here that reads -- makes it sound
