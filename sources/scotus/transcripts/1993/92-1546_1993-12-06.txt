ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In 1917, Lucius Ordway formed a trust with

11
12

substantial assets.

Each of his grandchildren, including

13

Sally Ordway Irvine, was given a remainder interest in the

14

trust.

15

was aware of her remainder interest.

16

father died, she became entitled to receive and did

17

receive each year a portion of the income from the trust.

18

In 1979, when the trust terminated, Mrs. Irvine

By 1931, when Mrs. Irvine was 21 years old, she
In 1966, when her

19

was entitled to receive one-thirteenth of the corpus of

20

the trust, which then exceeded $1/2 billion in value.

21

Mrs. Irvine at that time was 68 years old and had five

22

adult children.

23

She determined that she did not need her entire

24

share of this enormous fortune, and filed a written

25

disclaimer of a portion of her interest in the trust.

1

Under the disclaimer, each of her children received one-

2

sixteenth of her interest in the trust.

3

retained the remaining eleven sixteenths of her interest

4

for herself.

5

Mrs. Irvine

The Federal gift tax supplements the estate tax

6

by imposing a tax on any direct and indirect transfer of

7

property by gift.

8

whether Mrs. Irvine's 1979 disclaimer of five-sixteenths

9

of her interest in the trust represents a gratuitous

10
11

The question presented in this case is

transfer of property to which the gift tax applies.
Many of the issues presented in this case have

12

already been resolved by the Court.

13

v. Shaughnessy, it has been established that a remainder

14

interest in a trust is a form of property, to which the

15

gift tax applies, and the fact that the remainder interest

16

is subject to defeasance goes only to the value of that

17

interest and not to its character as property.

18

Since 1943, in Smith

The only other question posed by the statute is

19

whether the disclaimer of such an interest in property

20

represents a transfer of that property for purposes of the

21

gift tax, and in 1982, in Jewett v. Commissioner, this

22

Court held that it does.

23

interpretation of the Commissioner that a disclaimer that

24

is not made within a reasonable time after the taxpayer

25

learns of his interest in the property is an indirect

The Court accepted the

1

transfer of property to which the gift tax applies.
The Court explained that the passage of time is

2

3

crucial to the gift tax scheme.

4

the taxpayer can decide whether to retain the property for

5

himself or allow it to pass to the next generation.

6

analysis of the Court in Jewett obviously applies to

7

Mrs. Irvine's long-delayed disclaimer in this case.

The

The court of appeals concluded, however, that

8

9

With the passage of time,

the gift tax does not apply to this 1979 disclaimer solely

10

because the interest that was disclaimed was created in

11

1917, before the gift tax was enacted.
The Court's analysis ultimately rests upon its

12

13

acceptance of a legal fiction.

14

QUESTION:

15

here, Mr. Jones?

16
17
18

What section are we talking about

MR. JONES:

What section of the Internal Revenue

Code?
QUESTION:

Yes, where -- that the court of

19

appeals relied on, the fact that it was not created by

20

that particular date.

21

MR. JONES:

The section of the code that is

22

relevant would be section 2511, but I think that the

23

answer to your question is that in the enactment of the

24

Federal gift tax there was a provision that says that this

25

statute will not apply to any transfer prior to the date

1

of enactment, and so it was that retroactive -- it was

2

that feature of the statute that the court had in mind.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the Eighth Circuit also relied

4

on one section or subsection that talked about something

5

being a taxable transfer, didn't it?

6

7

MR. JONES:

Well, that was a different portion

of the court's rationale that I haven't yet discussed.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. JONES:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

Okay.

You're going to get to that?

Yes, sir.
Okay.
At this point, what I'm pointing out

12

is that the court's analysis ultimately rests upon its

13

acceptance of a legal fiction about disclaimers.

14

State law, a valid disclaimer is treated as if it were

15

made ab initio, at the same time that the initial transfer

16

was made, and that State legal fiction is designed to

17

protect the property from the intervening claims of

18

creditors and other third parties, but in Jewett the court

19

explained that those State law concerns do not control

20

application of the Federal gift tax, and that's because

21

the State legal fiction is counterfactual.

22

fiction and not a fact that a long-delayed disclaimer is

23

made ab initio.

24

disclaimer was made 62 years after the trust was formed

25

and a full half-century after she reached her age of

Under

majority.
QUESTION:

But under State law principles, it

would be treated as having occurred back in 1917?
MR. JONES:

That is correct.

Under State law

5

principles, the State deems the disclaimer to have been

6

made ab initio.

7

QUESTION:

And in Jewett, did this Court

8

indicate, the majority, that State law supplies the answer

9

in cases before the promulgation of the 1958 regulation?

10

MR. JONES:

No, to the contrary, the Court held

11

in Jewett that a disclaimer represents an indirect

12

transfer and then looked to the regulation to determine

13

the limitations on that analysis that the Secretary had

14

reached in issuing the interpretive regulation that was in

15

effect at that time.

16

QUESTION:

Do you take the position that in

17

light of Jewett there is no way that the court of appeals

18

judgment here can be affirmed?

19

MR. JONES:

20
21

I think Jewett and Jacobs, read

together, answer all the questions in this case.
Jewett answers the question of whether this is

22

an indirect transfer of property by gift.

23

Estate of Sanford answer the question of whether this gift

24

tax is applied retroactively when it's applied to a

25

transfer that occurs after the date of enactment but with

Jacobs and

1

respect to an interest that was created before the date of

2

enactment, and what the Court squarely held in Jacobs and

3

Estate of Sanford is that the gift tax retroactivity --

4

nonretroactivity requirement has nothing to do with a tax

5

that's imposed on a transfer that occurs after enactment.
QUESTION:

6

7

transfer take place?

8

MR. JONES:

9
10

Well, the transfer that is subject

to tax in this case occurred in 1979, when Mrs. Irvine
made a disclaimer.
QUESTION:

11
12

In your view, when did the taxable

When did the taxable transfer within

the meaning of the regulation take place?

13

MR. JONES:

Within the specific words of the

14

regulation, the taxable transfer referred to in the

15

regulation is the initial, completed gift.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. JONES:

18

So that's 1917?
That would have been in 1917, with

the gift in trust.

19

QUESTION:

So is it necessary for your case to

20

say that the 1917 creation of the trust was a taxable

21

transfer?

22

MR. JONES:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

It is not necessary for our case.
Is that your number 1 line of

defense?
MR. JONES:

No, not really.

1

that question you really have to start from the beginning

2

of describing what the '86 regulation does and what it

3

says.

4

The '86 regulation was made necessary by the

5

enactment of 2518 of the code, which established a fixed

6

9-month period for tax free disclaimers of interest

7

created after 1976.

8

under -- to implement the old and the new statutory

9

provisions, the '86 Treasury gift tax regulations used the

In adopting the regulations in 1986,

10

term, taxable transfer, to describe the initial completed

11

gift.

12

Now, we know that because the regs specifically

13

cross-reference to the contemporaneous regulations adopted

14

under 2518.

15

term taxable transfer for the purpose of the regulations,

16

and that definition is a completed gift regardless of

17

whether a tax was imposed.

18

Those regulations contain a definition of the

QUESTION:

Now, this --

May I just ask you a question there?

19

You said, regardless of whether a tax was imposed, but

20

that isn't the verb tense used in the reg, is it?

21

verb tense used -- the reg uses the present tense.

text, quotes the phrase,

"was not subject to the gift

3

that's what the reg says.

4

makes it easy for your case if you use the past tense, but

that's not what the reg uses.

6

MR. JONES:

It makes it -- I understand it

We -- respondents properly took us

7

to task for having a citation mistake at that page of our

8

brief, and we discussed that citation mistake in our reply

brief.
QUESTION:

10
11

The language came out of Ordway, is

that correct?
MR. JONES:

12

Yes.

The ibid -- what should have

13

been on page 26 was an ibid, and the simple explanation is

14

that the cite checkers in our office don't accept an ibid

15

at the beginning of a paragraph, and so when they struck

16

out the ibid, they looked to the last thing in the prior

quote.

I'm still not sure when, in your

21

view, the taxable transfer within the meaning of the

22

regulation took place.

23

MR. JONES:

Within the meaning of the regulation

24

there are two relevant transfers.

described as the taxable transfer in the regulation.

The initial transfer is

It

1

is defined in the regulation to simply mean, a completed

2

gift without regard to whether a tax is imposed.

3

simply a clock-starting mechanism.

It is

4

The phrase is awkward, and but for the

5

definition in the cross-section it would be confusing, but

6

with the cross-reference it's not confusing.

7

says you start the clock running from the date of the

8

initial completed gift.
QUESTION:

9

MR. JONES:

10

It simply

And in your view that is 1917?
That was in 1917, and we know -- the

11

phrase, completed gift, comes out of this Court's

12

decisions in Burnet v. Guggenheim and cases of that type,

13

and what it -- the completed gift is a gift made when the

14

donor has parted with all control and dominion over the

15

property, which Mr. Ordway did in 1917.

16

QUESTION:

Do you still -- do you take the

17

position here that the disclaimer had to be made prior to

18

the enactment of the gift tax?

19

MR. JONES:

20

To be subject to tax, the disclaimer

would have to be made after the date of the gift tax.

21

QUESTION:

No, but for the disclaimer to be

22

effective to avoid the tax on this transfer, Mrs. --

23

whatever her name was's transfer, do you take the position

24

that she was required to make that disclaimer prior to

25

1932?

MR. JONES:

1

In all likelihood, we would take

2

that position if the issue had arisen, but I want to

3

amplify that in two ways.

5

QUESTION:

took below, wasn't it?
MR. JONES:

6

7

10

QUESTION:

13

Is it an academic question, because

in fact she did not disclaim after the gift tax came into
effect?
MR. JONES:

11
12

It was an answer to a hypothetical

question.

8

9

That was the position that the IRS

Yes.

It really has no relevance to

this case.
QUESTION:

So you don't have to answer the

14

question whether, and suppose she had done it in 1933 or

15

1934, because she didn't do it till '79.

16

MR. JONES:

No, we don't have to answer that

17

question here, because here we have a full half century

18

that passed between the time she reached her age of

19

majority and the time that she disclaimed.

20
21

QUESTION:

it within a reasonable time of reaching her majority --

22

MR. JONES:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. JONES:

25

Would you agree that if she had done

Oh, yes.
-- that that would have sufficed?
Yes.

She reached her majority --

actually, the record's a little bit mixed on this.

1

Apparently, in Minnesota the age of majority was 18, so

2

she actually reached her age of majority in 1928, but it

3

really doesn't make any difference, and with respect to

4

your point --

7

QUESTION:

not to give her the extra 3 years.
(Laughter.)

8

MR. JONES:

9

QUESTION:

10
11
12

But possibly it was unconstitutional

MR. JONES:

I don't have any views on that.
You can concede that.
But I just want to point out that

there isn't anything odd -QUESTION:

Well, there's a decision of this

13

Court -- Stanton, I think v. Utah -- that suggests that

14

the differential in age of majority might be

15

unconstitutional.

16

MR. JONES:

17

QUESTION:

I accept that fully.
Alternatively, it might be

18

unconstitutional to give the men 3 more years.

19

one or the other is bad.

20

MR. JONES:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. JONES:

I mean,

I would leave that to you.
We'll argue -I really don't have an opinion on

23

that at this time, but I wanted to point out in response

24

to Justice Souter that there's nothing odd about saying

25

that for her to make a tax-free disclaimer it might have
13

1

been necessary to do it before the gift tax was enacted.

2

For anyone to make a tax-free gift, it would have been

3

necessary to do it before the gift tax was enacted.

4

That's equally true whether the gift was made by

5

disclaimer or by outright grant, so there's nothing odd or

6

unfair about suggesting that if she wanted to make a tax-

7

free disclaimer, it should have been done before the gift

8

tax - -

9

QUESTION:

But the argument that's being made is

10

that the disclaimer in effect precludes her acceptance of

11

the gift in the first place, and if the reason she wants

12

to preclude the acceptance is to avoid the gift tax, then

13

it would be sort of unreasonable to say that she was

14

required to make that act of refusal prior to the

15

enactment of the tax which she's trying to avoid.

16

MR. JONES:

There have been no cases that have

17

really been at the border that test the -- how you decide

18

what a reasonable time is.

19

QUESTION:

But you could concede that if she did

20

it a reasonable time from the effective date of the gift

21

tax, that would be a different case.

22

MR. JONES:

It might be a different case, but I

23

doubt that we would take that position.

24

reasonable time describes one of two things, and you can

25

look at it either the way the dissent or the majority did
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

We think that the

1

in Jewett.

The reasonable time either reflects a passage

2

of time that allows the disclaimer to work in an estate

3

planning function, which is clearly what we have in this

4

case.
Another way to look at the passage of time is

5
6

the way the 1986 regulations describe their interpretive

7

rationale, and that is that property cannot be disclaimed

8

free of tax after it is accepted, and that property is

9

deemed to be accepted when it has been retained without

10

disclaimer for more than a reasonable time.
Either of those rationales is really satis -- is

11

12

sufficient under the Jewett decision and under the

13

interpretive regulations.

14

QUESTION:

So your position is it shouldn't be a

15

decision driven by tax consequences, that what you're

16

looking to see is if this person was -- exercised control,

17

or - -

18

MR. JONES:

That is absolutely correct, because

19

there's no -- the gift tax doesn't apply only when it's a

20

substitute for estate planning.
QUESTION:

21

Well, it can be driven by tax

22

purposes.

23

because it will cost more in taxes if I accept it and then

24

give it to my children than if I let it go to my children

25

directly, and so long as I don't accept it, it can be

I can decide not to accept the gift simply

As long as --

MR. JONES:

That is the analysis of the

regulations which seems appropriate.

9

QUESTION:

Now, leaving aside the question of

10

when the reasonable time would come, your position would

11

be the same whether the reg -- what is it, 2511? --

discussed, which is that a disclaimer not made within a

reasonable time represents an indirect transfer of

property.

4

The other way to reach -- to make somewhat the

same point is that the interpretive regulation describes

No, sir.

MR. JONES:

That is absolutely correct, and the

definition of the phrase, taxable transfer, is contained

13

in the cross-reference provisions of section 2518 of the

14

regulations, and those, Chief Justice Rehnquist, are

15

quoted at the beginning of our merits brief on page 2,

16

where it says,

17

taxable transfer occurs when there is a completed gift for

Federal gift tax purposes regardless of whether a gift tax

19

is imposed on the completed gift," and again, a completed

MR. JONES:

It isn't the most felicitous

phrasing -- I'm not suggesting that it is -- but it is

5

phrasing that has been clearly articulated in the

6

regulation to have this specific meaning, and I think

7

there's a historical explanation for why they used this

8

perhaps awkward term.

9

It relates to the fact that the 1976 -- post

10

1976 transfers under section 2518, the initial starting

11

date was referred to in some of the legislative materials

12

as the original taxable transfer, and when they

13

coordinated these regulations in '86, they picked up that

14

same terminology, but it has no -- notwithstanding the

15

fact that the court of appeals seemed to give it great

16

weight, you cannot read the contemporaneous cross-

references in the regulations and be confused.

Well, I think the passage of time

is also misleading.

You know, the Government has a

regulation -- in fact, it comes out of the 1932 act

8

legislative history -- that says that the creation of a

9

joint bank account where a transferor transfers property

10

to an account and allows a transferee the right to

11

withdraw, that that's not a gift until the transferee

12

exercises that right to withdraw, and the transferee can

13

wait as long as he wants, and in fact the regulations

14

under section 2518 contain an example authorizing and

15

permitting that transferee to disclaim within 9 months

16

after the death of the transferor, so I think that the

issue of passage of time is not an end-all.

MR. MARTIN:

disturb the preexisting rights under existing instruments

such as Mrs. Irvine had under the Lucius Ordway Trust, or

did they intend to apply a brand new rule which, as

Justice Stevens pointed out, this Court interpreted in

Jewett.

that would not apply to preexisting interests.

Similarly,

2

in 1981 when they amended it, they did not retroactively

apply that amendment.

4

It's interesting that counsel for the

Government, when he argued this case in Jewett,

specifically said with respect to why 2518 wasn't applied

7

retroactively, he said that Congress normally legislates

8

prospectively in the estate and gift tax area.

9

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me the question is

10

not whether they intended to be retroactive in 1932, but

11

rather whether they intended, in 1932, to have State law

govern at all for the purposes of whether there is a

The -- this Court in Jewett did not decide that

all disclaimers are transfers.

The very premise of the

decision in Jewett was that a disclaimer may be an

indirect transfer.

That's all that the Court said.

When

11

the Court said that a transfer may be unquestionably

19

position -- I guess you can have two arguments here, and I

20

was assuming you were making one and maybe you're making

21

the other one.

22

You could be making the argument that this

23

entire scheme of disclaimer cannot apply to your trust

24

because your trust was created prior the enactment of the

25

gift tax and therefore nothing that relates to the gift

tax applies to your trust because of the time it was

2

created, or you could be arguing that the crucial point in

3

Jewett was that there was an opportunity, after the

4

enactment of the gift tax, to make the disclaimer, which

5

precluded the property from vesting in the taxpayer and

6

hence precluded the making of a gift at the time of the

7

disclaimer.

I thought you were making the second argument.
Maybe you're making the first one.
MR. MARTIN:

Well, actually, Your Honor, we're

making both arguments.
QUESTION:

Okay.

If you're making both

13

arguments -- if you're making both arguments, then with

14

respect to the second one, you would be in the same

15

position as the Jewett taxpayer, would you not, if we held

16

that the effective disclaimer by the taxpayer could have

17

been made within a reasonable time of the enactment of the

18

gift tax statute or within a reasonable time of her

19

attainment of majority?

20

MR. MARTIN:

Which really is saying that there

21

was some kind of a hidden grace period in the enactment of

22

the Gift Tax Act to permit disclaimers even though the

23

reasonable time had already expired.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it's saying that reasonable

time is to be determined with respect to the point of the

disclaimer, and if the point of the disclaimer is tax

2

planning, then reasonable time certainly couldn't start

3

running before there was any tax.

4

MR. MARTIN:

But in this case, the Government

5

has conceded, has acknowledged that under their position

of the case her right to disclaim expired before the

7

enactment of the gift tax.
QUESTION:

I think Mr. Jones said it was an
He acknowledged it would be a

different case.
MR. MARTIN:

11

I'm -- I'm relating what the

12

Government conceded at oral argument in the Eighth

13

Circuit, Justice Ginsburg, but that's right, he did -- he

14

did say that it would be academic, but I don't know that

15

it is academic, because it points out the problem with the

16

statutory construction here, that we have a statute which

17

would apply to --

18

QUESTION:

Well, the Court could take the

19

position, could it not, that even if there had to be -- if

20

the reasonable time had to run from the date the gift tax

21

took effect, even if that were so, it wouldn't make any

22

difference because here the disclaimer came over 40 years

23

later.

MR. MARTIN:

Well, it -- but that's the point,

that she would never have had any notification that she

was expected to disclaim at the time the gift tax was

enacted.
QUESTION:

Isn't there an intermediate position,

Mr. Martin, that -- she began to get income in 1966, as I

remember the facts --

QUESTION:

That's right.

8

and substantial income.

9

after becoming an income beneficiary, perhaps your case

10

would be much -- much more attractive.
MR. MARTIN:

11
12

Well, but, Justice Stevens, the

Government acknowledges the fact --

13
14

Had she disclaimed immediately

QUESTION:

And I know the Government doesn't

take that position at all.

15

MR. MARTIN:

Well, they not only don't take

16

that -- they've acknowledged that there is no acceptance

17

here.

18

In their regulations under section 2518, they

19

treat income interest and principal interest as separate,

20

and they make it clear that the acceptance of an income

21

interest does not prohibit a person from accepting a

22

principal interest, and so the fact that she received

23

income under the Government's own regulations is really

24

irrelevant.

is that the Court, when they decided Jewett, was not aware

that the Commissioner had consistently taken the position

that Brown v. Routzahn was the proper rule and that there

was a -- even more materials than what was available to

the Court at that time indicating that the regulation was

intended to codify Brown v. Routzahn and that the

7

Commissioner's position had not been entirely consistent

8

in interpreting the disclaimer regulations, that the --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Martin, you're dead right that

10

you've called our attention to things that were not before

11

us at the time of Jewett.

12

Their response, and I'd like you to directly

13

respond to their -- their response, as I understand it, is

14

that in each of the instances on which you place primary

15

reliance, there was a prompt disclaimer right after the

16

interest was disclaimed.

17

of the various cases that you've cited?

18

MR. MARTIN:

Do you agree with that appraisal

Well, I don't think that was true

19

at all in the 1966 private letter ruling, where we had an

20

inter vivos trust that was created in 1933.

21

beneficiary started receiving income in 1936, and 30 years

22

later, in 1966, her brothers died, and she became entitled

23

to an increased income interest.

24
25

The

Now, she was aware of that interest from the
time that she became a beneficiary of the trust. It was a

1

contingent interest.

It was contingent upon whether her

2

brothers had issue when they died, and it turned out that

3

they -- both of them had adopted children, and the court

4

ultimately held -- a State court -- that adopted children

5

were not issue.
As a result of that holding, the Government

6

7

takes the position that that's what gave rise to the

8

increase in the income, but that really isn't -- that

9

isn't any different than if one of those children had died

10

ahead of time, that if it had been a natural child and had

11

died ahead of the brother, we still would have had the

12

situation where there was an increase in income.

13

And certainly she was aware of that trust from

14

the time that she started receiving income, so she was

15

aware of her interest for 30 years, which is -- which was

16

the gist of Jewett's interpretation of the regulation, and

17

that was a trust that was established after the act.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24
25

MR. JONES:

With respect to the 1966 letter

ruling that was just referred to, we've discussed this in
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

our brief.
I just want to emphasize again that it was the

3

Commissioner's interpretation in that case that the

4

taxpayer did not have knowledge, or should not be

5

attributed to have knowledge of that interest until the

6

supreme court of Pennsylvania, after somewhat lengthy

7

litigation, determined that the adopted children could not

8

succeed to the interests of the other affected interest.

9

What is absolutely clear about that ruling is

10

that that was the Commissioner's interpretation, so in

11

stating his interpretation he was plainly being consistent

12

with the analysis of the regulation, which is that a

13

taxpayer has a reasonable time to disclaim after the

14

taxpayer becomes aware of the interest.

15

In brief, a person who transfers property by

16

gift is subject to tax.

17

Chief Justice Stone held for the Court that the Federal

18

gift tax looks to the economic realities of the transfer

19

of control.

20

for the Court in 1933 in Burnet v. Guggenheim.

21

In Estate of Sanford, in 1939,

Justice Cardozo said exactly the same thing

This Court's decision in Jewett is an

22

amplification of that simple principal, and as I've

23

already described, it is not subject to argument here that

24

the economic realities in this case reflect a lengthy

25

control over the property by Mrs. Irvine and an enjoyment

1

of the income interest, and an ultimate transfer of that

2

property to her children.

3

applies.

4

QUESTION:

Therefore, the gift tax

I don't know why an effective

5

disclaimer doesn't exercise effective control over the

6

property anyway.

7

a disclaimer amounts to a gift?

8

over the property, doesn't it?

9

to me, it goes to him, even if you exercise it promptly.

10

Why don't you go whole hog and say, even

MR. JONES:

That exercises control
It says, it doesn't come

You're saying a disclaimer made

11

within a reasonable time.

I believe that the

12

Commissioner's view of a disclaimer made within a

13

reasonable time is that if a tax is imposed on that

14

transfer, then it requires the taxpayer to accept the

15

gift, and the Commissioner doesn't want to impose that

16

requirement.

17

The Commissioner allows the gift to be

18

disclaimed within a reasonable time, but if it occur -- if

19

more than a reasonable time passes --

20

QUESTION:

I understand Justice Scalia to be

21

suggesting the Commissioner's giving away the Government's

22

money when he does that.

23

MR. JONES:

I think that what the Commissioner

24

is attempting to do is not to give away the Government's

25

money but to come up with a sensible approach to this

scheme.
Congress ultimately adopted a similar, even
though more objective rationale.

They give the taxpayer

9 months to disclaim.
I think that the legislation ultimately enacted
under 2518 reflects that the Commissioner's interpretation
of the proper application of this statute was sensible and
correct, and certainly the Court upheld it in Jewett.
QUESTION:

Why did Congress agree with it if it

was wrong?
MR. JONES:

Well, I believe it also reflects

that it was sensible and correct.
QUESTION:

And I suppose there's no largesse

involved, unless we assume that the Commissioner could
redefine the very concept of gift in a way which certainly
is not suggested by any act of Congress.
MR. JONES:

Well, what's really at issue here

is, when was the property transferred?

There's no

question that it was a gratuitous transfer.

The

disclaimer is an indirect transfer, and that was really
the event that the Commissioner's regulation focused on,
and this Court's decision in Jewett did.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Jones,
