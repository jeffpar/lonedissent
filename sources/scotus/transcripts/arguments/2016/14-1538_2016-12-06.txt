ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think because this is largely an

12

international trade case, it's probably useful to put

13

this case in context and to compare it to the facts that

14

gave rise to the passage of Section 271(f) that's at

15

issue in this case.

16

case, that was a case involving a shrimp deveiner in

17

which all of the activities took place within the United

18

States, except for the final act that took less than an

19

hour to assemble in a foreign country.

20

this Court held even that was not within the meaning of

21

the -- of the patent statute as it existed then, and

22

Congress then acted to fill that particular loophole.

23

You'll recall that in the Deepsouth

In that case,

The facts of this case seem to me to be the

24

polar opposite of that.

It spends tens of

are at issue in this case are sourced outside of the

And as relevant to this litigation, all of the

I'll come back to that in a

So the only contact that any of this has
with the United States is the fact that a single,

10

commodity product is shipped to England as part of the

11

process for the fabrication of these particular kits.

12

Now, that commodity product is called a Taq

13

polymerase, which I will readily concede that when I

14

think about what you buy off-the-shelf, I don't go to

15

Costco to buy Taq polymerase, but I'm told, and I think

16

it's absolutely undisputed in the record, that this is a

17

commodity.

enacted in (f)(2), which is a staple article or

And so the question is, is whether or not,

2

simply by using a single, staple article, Congress

3

intended through 271 to -- to declare that this is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell us --

-- a violation.
-- is this product

available outside the U.S.?

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Taq polymerase?
Yes.

Absolutely.

Yes.

It's --

11

it's readily available throughout the world through --

12

there are a variety of manufacturers who wish to make --

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's no patent on

that particular component?

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

17

product.

18

No, none that -- none that

As I said, it's a commodity

The -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we know why that

19

particular component was exported from the United

20

States?

You -- you said all the others --

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
-- were made in England.

Yeah, and the key to this is

24

you want -- you want to get the best quality product

25

at -- presumably, at the lowest possible price.

Alderson Reporting Company

And --

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

and most of these were purchased -- most of the Taq was

2

purchased from the Roche company, and I -- and I suspect

3

they just had a better supply arrangement.

4

I mean, that's -- that's the key to this

5

case in a lot of ways, is what you're looking for is,

6

what are the best supply arrangements that you can make

7

on a global basis?

8

States?

9

And what it seems to me clear that Congress could never

Can you get them in the United

Can you get them outside the United States?

10

have intended was to in some way disadvantage U.S.

11

manufacturers who are providing a particular staple.

12

Indeed, I would read 271(f)(2) as saying

13

categorically that the one thing Congress did not want

14

to do is to interfere with the ability to -- of a

15

manufacturer to provide a staple article as part of

16

the -- as part of an activity outside of the United

17

States.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If all of this had

19

happened in the United States, would there have been a

20

patent infringement suit that would be -- have merit?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, if everything had

22

take -- taken place inside the United States, there

23

would have been.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under the U.K. laws, are

patents generally enforced for items that are patentable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

in the U.K.?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Yes, absolutely.

3

And -- and -- and, indeed, in this case, Promega had --

4

I think Promega -- at least somebody had a patent in the

5

U.K., but that patent had expired, which is, candidly,

6

not surprisingly, why the activity was taken.

7

And that -- and that is ultimately, Justice

8

Kennedy, the answer to these issues.

9

in the United States is upset by the use of a particular

If a patentholder

10

invention outside the United States, the solution is to

11

go outside of the United States and seek packet -- pack

12

-- patent protection in that particular country.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I assume, though, that

14

there might be other countries that are not so vigorous

15

in their enforcements as the U.K.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I suspect that there

17

may be, although there -- you know, this isn't broadly

18

regulated by -- by treaties.

19

key is, you know, right -- you know, the United States

20

has agreed that each country should regulate its own

21

patent rights.

22

in -- in the Paris Convention in the 19th century,

23

and -- and consistently have accepted that.

24

that's -- and the whole theory of this, is to ensure the

25

free flow of commerce across borders on a regular basis,

And the -- and to me, the

I mean, we're bought into that deal

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

at least when we're talking about staple articles of

2

commerce.

3

You know, if -- if -- you know, where the

4

Federal Circuit clearly got this wrong is in saying that

5

you could interpret (f)(1), which talks about a -- a

6

substantial portion of the commodities, and say that a

7

single commodity can be a substantial portion, when

8

(f)(2) says that in order for a single commodity to

9

constitute a -- to give rise to a potential claim of a

10

violation, what it has to be is especially made or

11

especially adapted for use in the particular invention.

12
13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does "substantial portion"

mean a majority?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, I think it means

15

substantially more than a majority.

16

would say that it has to be approximating or very close

17

or tantamount to all.

18
19

JUSTICE ALITO:

I -- I would -- I

So here, there were five

components?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
And -- and they would have

22

to be -- all -- all five would have to be made in the

23

United States?

24
25

Or --

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I would -- at

minimum --

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- four would be enough?
I would have thought at least

four would have to be.

instances, my guess is the right answer may well be

5

five.

9

But I -- I -- you know, in many

JUSTICE KAGAN:
that from?

Where -- where do you get

What's the principle there?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Because all Congress wanted

to do was to close a loophole where you're essentially

10

doing nothing but violating U.S. patent law and avoiding

11

it by simply offloading it at the last second.

12

of instances, I don't think that's true when you're only

13

talking about a majority of -- of the -- the items.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In a lot

Well, how do we know that

15

that's all Congress wanted to do?

16

have been the -- the -- the scenario in Deepsouth, but

17

Congress used language that could refer to much more

18

than that, that could refer to a majority, that even

19

could refer to a substantial minority.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yeah.

I mean, that might

I -- I -- I think

21

there is no way to -- to -- first of all, the -- the

22

rule against extra -- the rule -- the presumption

23

against extraterritoriality would drive you in the

24

opposite direction.

25

the language either way, you would -- you would drive it

Even if you could reasonably read

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

toward recognizing that the company that the substantial

2

portion keeps is the word "all," and it's talking about

3

components.

4
5

And so those are, to my mind, very much
quantitative and driven in the direction of all.

6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so you agree that

"substantial portion" is an ambiguous term?

8
9

I --

MR. PHILLIPS:
I agree.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

I --

It could be interpreted in either of two ways,

10

which is why I think the principle against

11

extraterritoriality drives you in the direction of

12

saying Congress meant only to allow U.S. patents to

13

operate outside the United States in very narrow

14

circumstances.

15

the kinds of international problems that will

16

undoubtedly arise by an overbroad interpretation of

17

271(f), which is what the Federal Circuit has adopted,

18

leave it to Congress to go back and fix that, because

19

those are -- those are issues of international relations

20

that, it seems to me, Congress is in a much better

21

position than the courts --

And if Congress chooses to -- to create

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

But those are --

-- to sort out.
-- just two -- two

components, the polymerase and then a -- a patent --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

the -- a second part of a patent that we'll envision.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Clearly in that

3

situation, there's -- there's no liability, because

4

it -- you know, because only one of those components --

5

you know, either one of two things happen.

6

of them are being put together or -- or only one of them

7

is, and 271(f)(1) --

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Either both

It seems -- it seems to me

that even if we -- we agree with you that quantitative

10

is -- is the proper measure, you still have qualitative

11

coming in to balance your judgment, as in the case of

12

one out of two --

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- not in one out of

14

two.

15

271(f)(2) that says that if it's only one, and then it

16

has to be either especially --

One out of two, seems to me, is dictated by

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

No, no, no --

-- adapted or especially -Well, I'm just talking

about (f)(1).

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I thought you

22

were talking about one out of two components.

23

apologize.

24
25

I

No, when you get to one -- you know, there's
no question at some point, as you're approaching all,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

but not all, that you're going to have to make some

2

kinds of judgments, but it seems to me it's absolutely

3

critical that the Court maintain a very significant

4

numerical component to it.

5

allow the -- the extraterritorial principle not to have

6

the full sway that it should be entitled to.

Otherwise, what you do is

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

with your understanding of the extraterritorial

9

principle.

I'm not sure I agree

I don't -- I mean, do you really take that

10

down into the minutiae of every little clause?

11

to me it's once the law applies, then you apply normal

12

principles of statutory interpretation.

13

cases about that in other -- in other areas, which is

14

sort of what is the reach, I think, may be the

15

presumption against infringements in sovereign immunity,

16

is -- a case I can't recall right away that said, well,

17

once you get over it, you know, it's over, and then you

18

apply normal principles.

19

It seems

I think we have

And it -- I'm not sure at every turn --

20

okay, and we know that this is a statute that obviously

21

applies overseas.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yeah, Mr. Chief Justice,

23

that -- that's exactly the opposite of what the Court

24

said in Microsoft.

25

the issue is not simply, is this extraterritorial,

In Microsoft, the Court said that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

because there's no question that 271(f) operates

2

extraterritorially.

3

271(f).

4

interpret the word "component" very narrowly in that

5

context, candidly, in the same way that the -- that this

6

Court also interpreted it in the Deepsouth case, meaning

7

--

The question is the sweep of

And -- and this Court said that it was going to

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well --

-- very narrowly.

And we're

10

asking you to do the same thing, which is to say, adopt

11

a narrow construction of the "substantial component"

12

language so that it drives much closer to the word "all"

13

and recognizes that this is meant as a --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your real argument is just

15

that -- isn't it -- that you interpret it differently

16

than you do, and we cause a lot of problems in other

17

countries.

18

I mean, they -- they can't tell whether,

19

when they get one component, their lawyer is going to

20

have to know not only British law, it's going to have to

21

know American law.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's exactly -And -- and that's a very

practical argument.
MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it -- really, we don't

2

need -- well, you, it's up to you what you want to use.

3

But I don't -- you -- the problem is, if that's the

4

point, why do you need this sort of grand thing about --

5

about a -- a presumption against extraterritoriality?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Yeah -It's up to you what you

want to use, but --

Yeah, yeah, yeah -- well,

look, I'm -- I'm perfectly comfortable with, really,

11

any -- any policy argument you feel comfortable with.

12

That one --

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16
17

Well, I --- is certainly one that

we -- we embraced.
I mean, the other -- the other policy

18

argument that seems to me equally strong in this context

19

is the -- is the mischief that the Federal Circuit's

20

Rule provides for trolls, because now, not only do you

21

have all of the trolls in the world looking for all of

22

the products in the world, but now they're going to go

23

through the entire supply chain of every punitive

24

infringer and go after each provider of a single staple

25

article of commerce as part of this exercise --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

Do you think --- and it seems to me that

cannot be possibly what Congress intended.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think it's clear that

5

the -- that the -- the qualitative interpretation has a

6

greater extraterritorial effect than the quantitative

7

interpretation?

8

What if you have a situation where -- let's

9

say there are ten components, and nine of them are --

10

are made overseas, but those are very routine things;

11

those are like the product that was made in the United

12

States here.

13

You can buy them off the shelf.
But there's one that's very unique.

Now,

14

it's not made specifically for this device, but it's

15

very -- it's -- it's very unique, and that's -- and

16

that's made in the United States.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yeah.

Well, you know -- from

18

my -- it -- the only device coming from the United

19

States is a single device --

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
-- and it's not -- and it

22

doesn't satisfy "especially made or especially adapted."

23

It seems to me that (f)(2) tells you specifically,

24

that's not within the meaning of the statute.

And if Congress wants to fix

it, it can fix that.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm not sure if that's true,

Mr. Phillips.

6

negative implication, that this is the only time when

7

one component can create liability, is when it's

8

especially made or especially adapted.

9

be just independent clauses.

10

I mean, you're reading (f)(2) as having a

But these might

In other words, (f)(2) talks about a

11

component that's especially made, whether or not it's a

12

substantial portion of the product.

13

comes in and says -- independently creates a rule for a

14

component or components that are a substantial portion

15

of the product.

16

And then (f)(1)

So I'm not sure why we have to read (f)(2)

17

as creating this negative implication as to any product,

18

any single product, as opposed to just saying (f)(2) is

19

about specially made stuff, and it has nothing to do

20

with (f)(1), which is not about specially made stuff,

21

and provides a different test about substantial --

22

substantiality.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I mean,

in -- in the

24

first instance, I don't -- I mean, I don't think that's

25

the more natural way to read the two together.

Alderson Reporting Company

But then

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

I would go back, and -- and without trying to offend

2

Justice Breyer, go to the principle against

3

extraterritoriality, and say -- say to you that if there

4

were two different ways that are equally plausible to

5

interpret this language, you should interpret the

6

language to be more narrowly applicable, and therefore

7

less likely to interfere with extra -- with

8

extraterritorial -- extraterritorial application of

9

patent law.

10

And so that's the reason.

11

saying that you would have, in the abstract, been

12

compelled to a particular conclusion, but in a situation

13

where Congress has used the language talking about all

14

or a major -- or a -- or a substantial portion where all

15

is all but -- you know, it's very close to that, talks

16

about components of the invention, not of the invention

18

dropped out "of the components of the invention," where

Now, that -- that -- that's claim -- that's

5

claim construction.

6

the easiest thing in the world to do, and it requires

review of the claims, review of the specification and

8

the -- and the history.

9

it's really easy.

And that's, you know, not always

But in this particular case,

The claims say very categorically what each

Second, we are asking the Court to hold that

5

(f)(1) reaches the supply of all or a large portion of

6

the components of the invention, not any important

7

portion of the invention.

8

that it reaches the supply of all or something

9

tantamount to all of the components.

10

And the way we had put it is

And our principal practical concerns here

11

stem from the breadth of the Federal Circuit's ruling,

12

and it's broad because they are asking a loaded question

13

that's looking only at part of the picture.

14

If you look only at the supplied portion of

15

the components and you ask whether they are important or

16

essential to the operation or novelty of the invention,

17

the answer is always going to be yes.

18

inventions, if you take away any component, it isn't

19

going to work and it's not going to be patentable.

20

we think you just can't come at it that way.

21

In most

So

And then the second piece is that the

22

Federal Circuit isn't looking at all the components that

23

were not supplied, and so they are not asking the

24

comparative question of whether the person has done

25

anything similar to supplying all of the components.

1

And we think that's just a critical piece here.

2

an anti-circumvention provision.

3

shore up the basic territorial restriction against

4

actually making a patented invention in the United

5

States and then shipping it abroad, and we think it

6

needs to be interpreted with that purpose in mind.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It was enacted to

You keep saying

8

"substantially all."

9

"substantially all" has to mean just that:

10

This is

Mr. Phillips argued that
Almost all.

You, instead, in your brief, want us to keep

11

that vaguer, but I'm assuming that there is a minimum

12

that wouldn't constitute an infringement.

13

MR. TRIPP:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

40?

Well, I think -20 percent?

30 percent?

How -- how --

16

MR. TRIPP:

Well, so I think the -- the --

17

the one bright line that we -- that we are drawing here

18

is -- on the face of the statute is that one is never

19

enough.

20

and (f)(2) together the way this Court read them in

21

Microsoft the first time.

22

We think that's clear when you look at (f)(1)

Beyond that, the numbers are very important

23

under our test, but they are not the whole ball game.

24

We're -- we say this on page 26 of our brief.

25

also -- you would look not only at the numbers of the

Alderson Reporting Company

You could

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

components that were supplied and not supplied, but you

2

would also look at the relative time, money, and effort

3

that you would need to obtain the remaining components.

4

So if I could give --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

and effort, but not significance of the component?

7

MR. TRIPP:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

Time -- time, money,

I think -It seems to me that

the significance of the component would be the most
important consideration.

If --

11

MR. TRIPP:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think -- and so the -If it's the -- if

13

it's whatever you think is not quite enough, 70 percent,

14

but 70 percent of the components -- I mean, that's

15

really the core of what makes it work.

16

you wouldn't look at that differently than if it's 70

17

percent, but the 70 percent are, you know, fairly

18

insignificant.

19

MR. TRIPP:

I don't know why

Well, I -- I -- our principal

20

concern or -- as I was saying, is that if you just ask

21

the question of whether it's significant in the sense of

22

is it essential or important to the novelty of the

23

invention, I think that's just a black hole that's not

24

going to get you anywhere.

25

works better.

And we think our approach

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

And if I could just give you two examples of

2

how this would work using this particular invention?

3

So, if some -- if -- if the record here showed that

4

manufacturing the first component, the primer mix was,

5

you know, an incredibly difficult, time-consuming, hard,

6

challenging process, the bulk of the work here, but that

7

you could get the -- the reaction buffer very quickly in

8

a heartbeat, you know, it's like a dime a dozen, you

9

drop it into the kits and it works.

10

In that circumstance, if somebody supplied

11

all the components except the reaction buffer, we think

12

they would clearly be liable because they would have

13

done something that is really tantamount to supplying

14

all of the components.

15

easily, but if supply -- if somebody supplied all the

16

components --

17

You could get that last one so

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To the expert testimony

18

here that out of the five, three were significant, so

19

let's assume they supplied the three significant

20

components and not the two less insignificant.

21

what would your answer be then?

22

MR. TRIPP:

What --

I think that would be a much

23

closer case to supplying something that is tantamount to

24

supplying all of them under our test.

25

the record here isn't -- isn't fully set out in terms of

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the --

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

what it is that -- that -- that makes them main or

2

major.

3

What we are trying to get at -- and -- and

4

the key point to us, whether exactly how you articulate

5

this test I think doesn't matter all that much to us,

6

but what we really do care about is the idea that this

7

needs to be a comparative inquiry looking at how much

8

work there is left to be done to obtain the rest of the

9

components so that --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think once you --

11

once you're into your fairly complicated test, I mean, I

12

think it's -- you're off to the races.

13

factors do you look at, all of that, when it -- it seems

14

to me the -- the clear argument is whether you want to

15

call it the plain text or not, but it's just focusing on

16

a numerical.

17

of the components, and now you're saying, well, it kind

18

of depends on what components we are talking about.

19

know, how much time it takes to make them.

20

don't quite understand what effort means in that area.

21

I mean, what

It's -- it's -- it's a substantial portion

You

Effort, I

In -- in other words, you're -- you're --

22

you're compromising the principle in a way that really

23

undermines the force of the principle.

24
25

MR. TRIPP:

No, I -- I -- I think that what

we are saying is that the -- the statute carries the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

quantitative meeting in the sense that it needs to be a

2

large portion, but this is an anti-circumvention

3

provision and then trying to figure out what it needs

4

for it to be a large portion, the numbers are a whole

5

lot of the picture.

6

I -- I don't want to -- I don't want to

7

diminish that, but as we said on page 26, we think they

8

are not the entire ball game, and a court look at --

9

could look at some qualitative factors, but that it

10

would not look at the question of whether what's left on

11

the table is essential or in -- or to the novelty,

12

because the answer to that is always going to be yes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know enough

14

patent law to have the answer to this.

15

claim is made, what -- how is the determination made of

16

what the elements are?

17

sort out the common from the uncommon in a patent claim?

18

MR. TRIPP:

When a -- a

Do the elements' determinations

Not as I understand it, no.

It

19

would just be -- it would just be sorting out what the

20

elements are, and -- and the way we approach the

21

components of the invention, this is on page 27 of our

22

brief, is we think, as in Microsoft, that they --

23

they -- they are -- they need to be capable of

24

combination, and they are derived from the elements of

25

the claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

So we think in -- in most cases it actually

2

won't be that difficult.

3

as I was saying, I -- I think under our approach, it

4

also, frankly, wouldn't matter that way.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And also, as it -- you know,

But why do we have to go

6

into the details here?

7

instance where maybe the less said by us the better.

8

mean, would you be happy if we say it means what it

9

says?

10

I mean, it did strike me as an
I

"All or substantially all" means a whole

11

lot.

12

get into that circumstance or you get into the "to"

13

circumstance, which is there is a special ingredient

14

here that has the special qualities, Mr. Manufacturer,

15

don't get close to that.

Or what you said, tantamount to all.

16

MR. TRIPP:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if you

I -- I think -All these lawyers that will

18

be there telling them, don't get close to that, and the

19

thing will work over time.

20

down, then all those lawyers will be trying to figure

21

out how, in fact, they actually do the thing without

22

quite infringing the detail test.

23

MR. TRIPP:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. TRIPP:

If we set a detailed test

Yeah, I -- I -- I think that -That's what worries me.

I -- I think if you said that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

one was never enough and it needs to be a whole lot, we

2

would be quite happy.

3

All that we're --

JUSTICE BREYER:

End of the case.

It says

4

one means a lot, we need a whole lot, tantamount to the

5

whole lot, and good-bye.

6
7

MR. TRIPP:

Yeah, we -- we -- we would be

perfectly happy with that.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. TRIPP:

All -- all that I'm trying to do

10

is try and give you our sort of best gloss on

11

interpreting --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then why did you -- why

13

did you add the qualification to put in qualitative

14

considerations in addition to quantitative?

15

MR. TRIPP:

Well, as I was trying to get at

16

with the -- the illustrations using this particular

17

invention, like you could get to a different answer even

18

when you have the same number of components.

19

somebody supplied everything but the reaction buffer,

20

this one you would get cheaper and easily, we think you

21

would be liable.

22

So if

But if they did everything except the primer

23

mix, and that's really just an enormous amount of --

24

of -- of what needs to happen here, then we think they

25

wouldn't have done something that's tantamount to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

supplying all the components.

2

liable because there would be so much left to be done.

And they wouldn't be

3

But I think, frankly --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that's your

5

answer in this invention, but every other invention is

6

going to have a different mix of the time, the effort,

7

the, you know, qualitative aspect, and it -- again, it

8

does seem to be that once you get beyond looking at

9

purely quantitatively in terms of the components, I

10

don't think you've made much progress in clearing up

11

the -- the litigation costs and the confusion.

12

And I'm also not sure how it fits in with

13

the presumption against extraterritoriality, or at least

14

the clear application of that.

15

MR. TRIPP:

Well, I -- I -- I think the main

16

thing that we are getting at is that -- and -- and --

17

and again, as I was saying, I -- I don't think we have a

18

strong -- strong position on how exactly you -- you

19

articulate the test.

20

pinned to an anti-circumvention provision, and the

21

question is, are you doing something that is pretty

22

close to supplying all the components?

23

you --

24
25

Our concern is that it needs to be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How exactly are

Because there's a reason why

it's that almost all.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

I mean, if I said to you, Mr. Tripp, a

2

substantial portion of my former clerks have gone into

3

government work, how many would I mean?

4

MR. TRIPP:

Well, I -- I think with any of

5

these things, the interpretation of substantial depends

6

entirely on its context and its purpose, and -- and --

7

and so this term is used in just, like, a countless

8

array of ways in the law.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're not pinning this

10

on the -- on the language here, the substantial portion

11

means almost all?

12

MR. TRIPP:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14
15

someplace else?

Well, no -You are finding it from

And where are you finding it from?

MR. TRIPP:

So we're trying to give a gloss

16

on substantiality in light of the context and purpose of

17

this statue as -- as we understand all of 271(f) is

18

designed to shore up the basic restrictioning and is

19

actually making a patented invention in the United

20

States and then shipping it abroad.

21

provisions get at that.

22

that resemble the Deepsouth paradigm you're --

23

Both of the

We think (f)(1) is situations

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then you take Justice

2

mentioned was.

3

MR. TRIPP:

I think in -- in -- in the one

4

is never enough, (f)(2) was just a complete answer to

5

that.

about the supply of an individual super important

7

component, you would have expected to see it in (f)(2),

and it's just not there.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

I think it's extremely important to

16

understand how fundamentally the Petitioners and the

17

government misapprehend the nature of the harm that

18

Congress addressed in 271 as enacted.

19

Deepsouth solution was proposed by Senator Mathias, it

20

precluded the supply with no active inducement

21

requirement, the supply of the material components of a

22

combination that if combined in the United States would

23

infringe.

24
25

When the

In the 1984 hearing that's discussed at page
29 of our brief, the United States -- the commissioner

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

of patents came in and testified that the United States

2

objected to that interpretation.

3

topdown -- you know, not -- not totally all, and

4

proposed instead that Senator Mathias amend his

5

legislation to preclude what in essence is prohibited

6

domestically in 271(c); that is, contributory

7

infringement.

8

designed part where there are no substantial

9

non-infringing uses.

10

They objected to the

That is the supply of a single, specially

That in and of itself shows you how far --

11

and that is, in fact, 271(f)(2).

12

far from this "all or substantially all" paradigm

13

Congress was aiming.

14

And that shows you how

Now, Senator Mathias's response right

15

there -- and again, we discuss it at page 29 -- was,

16

okay, I understand that.

17

situation of the, quote, exporter who sends specific

18

instructions on how to manufacture a product which would

19

infringe a U.S. patent notwithstanding the use of a

staple product or products?

But what about, he said, the

And Commissioner Mossinghoff's response was,

23

to 271(b).

24

which makes one liable as an infringer if you actively

induce infringement by another and --

That would be the analog

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're -- but

2

you're -- you're beginning with a dialogue at a Senate

3

hearing on the bill that's pretty weak even in the

4

legislative history hierarchy, but I don't think you've

5

mentioned the actual language of the statute yet.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, that -- thank you,

7

Mr. Chief Justice.

8

legislative history alone.

9

in --

10

And I'm not relying on the

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is just one example

Well, how does it help you?

11

Because I -- it's very hard for me to believe that

12

Senator Mathias really wanted to interpret American

13

patent law so that it runs the world when we've entered

14

into a treaty which says British patent law runs

15

Britain, French France, and so forth.

16

something in this history which says no, no, Senator

17

Mathias had a different view; he -- he wanted whenever

18

you send any component abroad that's in a patent,

19

suddenly American law governs it?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, is there

So, Justice Breyer, before I go

21

back to the history, I'll take the Chief Justice's

22

admonition and -- and -- and focus on the language.

23

I mentioned the history, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

only because it's rare that an exchange in the

25

legislative history translates so directly to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

language of the statute as a result of that exchange

2

which we're not relying on as interpretive authority.

3

Senator Mathias did exactly what the United States

4

suggested.

5

material components and came back with what is now

6

271(f)(1) and (f)(2).

7

He -- he scrapped the original -- the

(f)(1), modeled on 271(b), precludes active

8

inducement in the United States, and 271(f)(2) precludes

9

following on 271(c).

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know.

But I

11

mean, you know, you know the objection.

12

don't know how many of the people voting on the bill

13

went back and read the Senate hearing.

14

I don't -- I

I understand the argument when you're

15

talking about something in the Senate Report or the

16

House Report at a fairly high level of connection to the

17

statute.

18

the dialogues at a particular hearing in one House --

19

one committee of one House of the Congress, that's a

20

real stretch.

21

But when you're wading into the particular --

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Let me -- let me -- let

22

me put aside that exchange.

23

report does acknowledge what is obvious from the face of

24

the statute and which I believe -- and this Court

25

recognized in Microsoft v. AT&T, which is the 271

The -- the -- in fact, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

provisions were modeled after induced infringement under

2

271(b) and contributory infringement under 271(c).

3

-- and --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

What about the -- what about

5

the text of the -- of the statute?

6

substantial portion of the patented invention."

7

"a substantial portion of the components" of -- of the

8

patented invention.

9

It doesn't say "a
It says

So if I were to -- you know, if I were to

10

ask, what is a substantial portion of the pages of your

11

brief, I think someone would think that's a quantitative

12

determination and -- and would not think that, well, you

13

know, I think pages 12 to 16 of your brief are

14

particularly important, so that would be a substantial

15

portion of the -- of the pages of your brief.

16

MR. WAXMAN:

So I -- let me go first to

17

the -- to the question about the use of the word

18

"components" rather than "invention" and then address

19

your -- your question on the substantial number of

20

pages.

21

As this Court explained in Microsoft

22

v. AT&T, the use of the word "components" is the -- is

23

Congress's indication that the combinations that are

24

precluded are tangible or physical combinations, not

25

method patents or unembodied software.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's how you

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

know what the scope of the combination is.

2

And if Congress had said, you know, to

3

export one or more rather than a substantial portion,

4

you would still use the plural because the plural is

5

necessary to accommodate the instance in which it will,

6

in fact, commonly be more than one.

7

Now, in your hypothetical, if you're talking

8

about a substantial portion of units that are

9

indistinguishable from each other, like pages of the

10

brief, then I concede that the more natural reading is a

11

quantitative one.

12

is used in the relevant provisions, the provisions of

13

the patent code that my friend on the other side is

14

averting to, that is (f)(2), where substantial

15

non-infringing uses is plainly at least partly

16

qualitative, or, as they say, the Warner-Jenkinson, the

17

doctrine of equivalence case where equivalency turns on

18

substantiality of functions and methods and uses, it is

19

also qualitative, our argument is that, again, we agree

20

with the United States whether the extent to which

21

substantial is qualitative or quantitative depends on

22

the context.

23

But if you look at how "substantial"

And so my only point, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

just so that I'm not misunderstood here, is Congress --

25

when Congress, rather than what it started to do, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

was to count down -- enact something that counted down

2

from all the components, it instead scrapped it at the

3

United States' suggestion and started from the ground up

4

from contributory infringement, which is just one

5

component specially designed, and active inducement,

6

which doesn't require the supply of any components.

7

Now, in this instance, and this goes, I

8

think, to Justice Breyer's question about

9

extraterritoriality, Congress was very careful -- of

10

course, as this Court recognized in Microsoft, there are

11

extraterritorial implications because it concerns

12

exporting things for something to be done in commerce

13

overseas.

14

the conduct that the provision looks at domestic only.

15

It is -- you have to actively induce from the United

16

States an active inducement, this Court explained in the

17

Grokster case means active steps to encourage like

18

advertising or providing instructions.

19

support --

20

But Congress was very, very careful to make

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You have to

What do you do -- what do

21

you do with the word "all"?

22

would be easier if that word were not in the statute.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

I take it your argument

I don't -- I don't -- I'm

24

not -- I don't -- I don't agree that our argument would

25

be easier.

All, you know, has the same implications one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

way or the other, whether you call substantial

2

quantitative or qualitative.

3

aiming at less than all.

4

Clearly Congress was

But it's a commonplace for -- for

5

legislatures for completeness' sake to say all or fewer

6

than all, or all or some.

7

want to correct one thing.

8

kept saying this is all or substantially all.

9

all or substantially all.

And, Justice Breyer, I do
You -- you inadvertently
It's not

It's all or a substantial

10

portion.

11

our brief, there are -- it is a commonplace locution in

12

State statutes and probably Federal statutes to use all

13

or substantially all, which is more clearly

14

quantitative.

corporate law statutes that talk about the sale or

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, after that -So then the question

argument, because what they're saying --

MR. WAXMAN:

Sorry.

13

examples:

14

Let's assume that you have a patented pharmaceutical, a

15

tablet that, you know, remediates a disease.

16

as is commonplace in these combinations, it has one

17

active ingredient, and it has five inert ingredients

18

that are as easy to pick up as you can imagine.

19

One, I'll adopt Justice Alito's hypothetical.

It has --

The thing that is exported -- the -- the --

20

the factory overseas, which by the way is never liable

21

under the statute because the statute only applies to

22

conduct in the United States, they -- they're happy to

23

go down to their local warehouse and get the -- the five

24

inert ingredients.

25

But the -- the -- the molecule that does all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

the work, they import from the United States.

2

Now, my friends on the other side would say,

3

and I believe Mr. Tripp actually did say, if that

4

molecule has no non-infringing uses, it's illegal.

5

if it's such a great molecule that it actually has

6

another non-infringing use, say it also powers the

7

injectable form of the pharmaceutical, which is not

8

patented, that what Congress intended to do was leave

9

this giant doughnut hole in the rule between the active

10

inducement of a commodity, that is, non-bespoke

11

component.

12

But

You have to -- you know, there's no

13

liability at all.

14

of those inert components, or you have to show that, you

15

know, there, in fact, is a patent on the injectable

16

form.

You have to supply all or nearly all

Or take also the example that was at issue

18

in this Court's decision in Quanta Computer.

19

Thomas explained for the Court that that was a case that

20

involved the patent exhaustion doctrine where Intel was

21

supplying a very sophisticated microchip, microprocessor

22

that was used by Quanta Computer in a computer that had,

23

you know, gazillion other components.

Justice

24

And the question was whether Intel's sale of

25

the microprocessor to LGE, which then sold it to Quanta,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

exhausted the patent.

2

well, it didn't exhaust the patent on the combination,

3

because, obviously, it's only one or two components.

4

And what this Court said is,

But because that microchip -- that

5

microprocessor embodied the -- what it said was the

6

inventive aspect of the computer as a whole, we are

7

going to take account of that and hold that patent

8

exhaustion applies.

9

pharmaceutical example or Justice Alito's, you know, one

And that would apply not only to my

10

super important component, it would apply to a more --

11

you know, the Quanta example where there may be -- say

12

there are 20 components, but three of them constitute

13

the inventive aspect.

14

This -- the language is capacious enough and

15

can be read in a commonsense way to make clear that that

16

is what Congress intended to address in (f)(1) by

17

enacting -- provided there is active encouragement for

18

the combination, by enacting the analog, the -- the (f)

19

analog to what is active inducement under (b).

necessary to the operation of the patented device, how

do you decide if one is substantial, one out of five?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I'm going to answer your

6

question, but first of all, let me simply correct a

7

couple of statements by my friend, I think in response

8

to your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg.

The evidence in this case was that as to

components were supplied.

polymerase were supplied for almost half of the kits.

There was a -- there was a

Second of all, Taq polymerase,

15

notwithstanding my friend's reference to what he found

16

on the Internet, the testimony at trial is that the Taq

17

polymerase that is necessary to make these STR kits

18

sufficiently reliable to be commercially salable was --

19

and there was testimony about this at trial -- was a

20

form of very particular Taq polymerase made by Roche

was required, and the testimony at trial was, was

Now, as to your question, Justice Ginsburg,

2

the question of whether in this case, whether it was

3

stipulated -- it was conceded there were five

4

components, although I must say I'm not sure that's

5

right, that of the five components, one or two were

6

exported.

And as -- and the question is how do you

know whether that one or two is sufficient?

instructions?

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Excuse me?
How -- how in the world

14

would a jury go about deciding that?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it's interesting in this

16

case because for other reasons, Life Technologies at

17

other points of the trial wanted to emphasize just how

18

important and unique this form of Taq was.

19

actually argue to the jury that it wasn't a substantial

portion.

It didn't

Our lawyers argued in their -- in their

That is a substantial component.

There was no request that the jury be

instructed as to how you determine what is or isn't

substantial, and the way the Federal Circuit -- the

If I could just finish my

Sure.

The Federal Circuit dealt with

8

this as a substantial evidence question.

holding that one is sufficient in this case.

They weren't
They asked

10

whether there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury,

11

and they concluded that the answer was yes, because all

of the testimony -- and there were days of testimony

about how polymerase works and the polymerase chain

reaction.

polymerase was.

If there are, as I understood the expert

testimony from the briefing -- and I could be wrong, and

you'll correct me on that -- but assume my hypothetical,

that there are three substantial components in this

That is a caricature of what

It recounted the fact that both their witnesses and our

It didn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

If you're asking me the hypothetical

2

question, if all the jury heard was -- and heard -- the

3

jury heard nothing more than, there are five components

4

and three are important, would that be sufficient for a

5

jury to include -- to conclude that one was a

6

substantial component?

7

I wouldn't say so.

But that's a caricature of what actually

8

happened in an eight-day trial that was very much

9

focused on Taq polymerase and the particular form of Taq

10

that was supplied here, and so this Court could, if this

11

Court agrees with us that there may be circumstances --

12

maybe it's the Quanta example, or maybe it's Justice

13

Alito's example -- in which one component constitutes

14

a -- could constitute a substantial portion, and

15

therefore liability would apply if there were conduct

16

that amounted to active inducement, this Court could

17

then say, okay, we are going to roll up our sleeves and

18

we are going to read the trial transcript and we are

19

going to look at what the evidence was in order to

20

determine whether, on the case as it was tried here, a

21

reasonable juror could find that Taq polymerase was that

22

important.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in order to do that,

24

it would be necessary to know what "a substantial

25

portion of the components" means.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

So what would you tell a jury that means?

2

MR. WAXMAN:

So I would tell a jury, you

3

know, following the dictionary definitions, that

4

"substantial" means considerable in importance and/or

5

amount.

6

may consider, you know, whatever factors are introduced

7

in the case, just as when -- as this Court has

In Basic v. Levinson, this Court rejected

know, help the jury determine what is obvious in light

20

of prior art.

And in the patent context, this Court

That was KSR.

These are all instances in which this Court

They have to go beyond that and

actively encourage, send instructions or blueprints or

substantial portion of the components, which wouldn't be

3

wood or saline solution or something like that, and,

4

importantly, has to take the additional steps of

5

actively inducing.

6

And in Grokster, this Court, when it was

7

underscoring what "active inducement" means, said,

quote, "Showing that the infringement was encouraged

overcomes the law's reluctance to find liability when a

10

defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for

some unlawful use."

12

And that is -- that's the point.

The point

13

here is that we're talking about conduct that occurs

14

only in the United States that must require -- that must

include the act of active inducement, specific intent

you send -- keep sending that, you're going to violate

3

that patent and we're going to come after you.

4

And what's that going to do?

5

to disrupt the supply chain in the United States, and

6

the ultimate effect is going to be twofold:

7

purchasers outside the U.S. will stop purchasing from

8

inside the U.S., or U.S. manufacturers will go offshore.

9

And the one thing we know that 271(f) was never intended

That's going

Either

10

to do was to accomplish that kind of an -- that kind of

11

an impact -- negative impact on the U.S. economy.

12

I urge the Court to reinstate the -- the

13

judgment as a matter of law that the District Court

14

entered.

15

Thank you, Your Honors.
