CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 16-240, Weaver v. Massachusetts.
Mr. Kimberly.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KIMBERLY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The upshot in practice of the Commonwealth's

11

proposed rule in this case is that when a criminal

12

defendant like Petitioner demonstrates that his trial

13

counsel failed to preserve the fundamental fairness of

14

the criminal proceeding by failing to object and,

15

therefore, allowing to stand a structural error, the

16

gravest kind of constitutional error there can be in the

17

course of a criminal trial.

18

the defendant to obtain relief under Strickland against

19

Washington for ineffective assistance of counsel.

20

that's because the Commonwealth says that such -- all

21

such defendants must prove actual prejudice resulting

22

from their attorney's deficiency.

It would be impossible for

And

23

But the problem is that when an attorney

24

deficiency results in a structural error, it will be

25

practically impossible to demonstrate what the practical

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

affects of --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The problem is the

3

structural errors -- I think one brings -- put it this

4

way -- come in all sizes and shapes.

5

not -- not an exclusion of public from the trial itself.

6

It's only the from the jury selection.

7

So here we have

But I take it your view is it doesn't

8

matter.

9

selection, everything else is open, or if the entire

If it had been the first day of the jury

10

proceedings were closed.

11

from structural error directly to new trial.

12
13

Structural error -- you go

Do you make any distinctions between kinds
of errors that we have called structural?

14

MR. KIMBERLY:

The short answer, Your Honor,

15

is no.

16

context of the public-trial right, for example.

17

distinctions play out as -- at the threshold question

18

whether the public-trial right, in fact, has been

19

violated.

20

There are distinctions to be made in -- in the
Those

But certainly what this Court suggested in

21

Waller where the courtroom closure was for a -- a

22

suppression hearing at the outset of the trial and not

23

the entire trial, that when the public-trial right is

24

deemed to have been violated, it is itself structural.

25

That doesn't mean, as -- as -- as Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

Stevens recognized in footnote 23 of his concurrence in

2

Reporters Committee, that doesn't mean that the

3

public -- that every single closure of the courtroom

4

necessarily implicates the public-trial right as the

5

framers of the Sixth Amendment would have understood it.

6

For instance, sidebars and in some -- in some instances

7

chambers conferences and certainly any circumstance in

8

which the State is -- is able to pass the -- a strict

9

scrutiny test established by Waller, those sorts of

10

closures, although closures in the technical sense,

11

would not be closures in the constitutional sense.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I -- this may

13

not be directly pertinent, but why was the courtroom

14

considered closed?

15

of the public.

16

pool, but, of course, they weren't all chosen.

17

I mean, it was filled with members

Now, they were there as part of the jury

I mean, what was the -- did the judge have

18

to set aside how many seats for people who weren't

19

actually being called for jury duty before you would

20

conclude that the courtroom was not closed?

21
22
23
24
25

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -- I would have

thought that the courtroom -- so the -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
a limited space.

Not -- I mean, it's

There's only so many --

MR. KIMBERLY:

Sure.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- spaces and

2

it's -- you know, he's got to get the jury pool in there

3

and, you know, they took up all the space.

4

must -- your position must be on the error itself that

5

the judge should have kept aside certain seats for

6

people who weren't being called for jury duty.

7

curious how many that is.

8

MR. KIMBERLY:

9
10

elements to that question.

So you

I'm just

So I -- there are two
I'll take them each in turn.

The first is we know that the courtroom was

11

closed because members of the public and -- indeed,

12

every member of the public who expressed an interest in

13

attending the proceeding who was not a member of the

14

jury venire was turned away, actively turned away.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but -- but

16

you -- presumably, I guess the argument is, well, they

17

were turned away because there was no -- no room.

18

there was no room because the courtroom was full of

19

members of the public who were called for jury duty.

20

MR. KIMBERLY:

And

So -- and that leads to the

21

second answer.

22

held in Presley, first of all, courtroom crowding is not

23

a sufficient answer for turning away -- a sufficient

24

justification for turning away other members of the

25

interested public.

And -- and -- and that is, as this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'll have to go back

2

and look at Presley, but courtroom overcrowding is not a

3

justification for turning away other people, what are

4

they supposed to do?

5

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, but to be very clear,

6

that is precisely what happened in Presley.

7

the -- the --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Presley,

What did they say in

Presley that you were supposed to do?

In other words,

10

there's no room in the courtroom, and you say, well,

11

that's not a justification for keeping people out.

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

So the answer is very simply

13

bringing in the jury venire in groups of, say, 40 rather

14

than allowing all 90 in at once.

15

I think, very practical solutions to this particular

16

problem that would have allowed the judge to keep the

17

gallery open to members of the public.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There are a range of,

Presumably, lawyers are

19

members of the public.

20

public.

21

presuming that once those jury members -- if they were

22

given a choice, would not be there.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

The judge is a member of the

The bailiff is a member of the public.

I'm

And so I think they have

stopped being a member of the public as might be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

understood with respect to access.

2

of members of the public as anyone who might be

3

interested, but not compelled to be in attendance.

4

MR. KIMBERLY:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think one thinks

Right.
All right.

So I think

6

what Presley said, if I'm not mistaken, is that you

7

can't keep out interested people just because of

8

overcrowding.

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

That's exactly right.

And I

10

think underlying that holding is a recognition that not

11

all members of the public are the same.

12

instance, for instance, the members of the public who

13

were excluded from the proceeding were the defendant's

14

own mother, his mother's boyfriend, sister, and pastor.

15

And -- and so bearing in mind that the jury

So in this

16

empanelment is the point at which the defendant is

17

introduced to the judge and jury for the first time,

18

it's the first opportunity for the defendant to make an

19

impression on the people who decide his or her guilt or

20

innocence, it makes a real difference both in terms of

21

how the defendant behaves, that members of the

22

interested public, not just any member of the public,

23

but his support system, his friends and family, are

24

present.

25

It has an effect on his demeanor and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

confidence with which he presents himself, but it also

2

has an effect on how the jury perceives him.

3

what does it say that at the first time that the

4

members, again, of the jury who are going to decide this

5

young man's guilt or innocence, he is presented to them

6

without the support even of his mother.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because

So what -- what you're

8

saying, and I -- I think this is true -- is that there

9

are circumstances in which closing the courtroom can

10

have an effect on the outcome of the -- of the trial.

11

But, conversely, is it your position that

12

it's never possible for there to be a violation of the

13

right without there being an effect on the trial; that

14

it's never possible to show that this could not have had

15

any effect on the outcome?

16

MR. KIMBERLY:

I think that's right.

It's

17

to say that -- and -- and this is reflected in this

18

Court's precedence --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. KIMBERLY:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

As a practical matter --- in -- in Waller.
As a practical matter, it's

22

never possible to show that it -- there -- it would --

23

there would be no outcome -- no effect on the outcome?

24
25

MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- I think this is

precisely the sort of situation that the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

recognized in Gonzalez-Lopez about the right to counsel

2

of choice.

That is a --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. KIMBERLY:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So in this --- speculative inquiry.
In -- in this case, what's

6

your best theory about how this could have affected the

7

trial?

8
9

What happened here?
MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, as I was just

describing, there's no way to tell what effect the

10

presence of the defendant's mother would have had on the

11

impression made to the jurors, who, again, were first

12

introduced to him and -- and formed their first

13

impression of him sitting alone without the support of

14

anybody.

15

his own demeanor.

16

effect of his -- his mother's and -- and pastor's

17

presence would have had on the demeanor of the attorneys

18

and the judge.

19

There's no way to know what effect it had on
There's no way to know what the

These are all completely -- and -- and as --

20

as we say, it may be that the attorneys may have

21

exercised preemptory challenges in different ways.

22

may be that prospective jurors moved by the differences

23

of the presence of the public would have answered

24

questions in somewhat different ways and would have

25

formed different inquit attitudes about the defendant.

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

These are completely unknowable and

2

indeterminate effects, though.

3

this Court said in Waller, and it's why since Waller,

4

the lower courts have universally treated the question

5

of a courtroom closure as a structural error as to which

6

harmless error on direct appellate review simply cannot

7

be demonstrated.

8

exact same analysis applies with respect to Strickland,

9

actual prejudice.

10

And that's exactly what

And -- and we think certainly that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose the two people

11

who couldn't get in were members of the public, but not

12

the defendant's mother and her pastor.

13

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, again, I think it would

14

depend on -- on who they are.

15

here also is there's no way to tell what sort of the

16

downstream effects of the closure are outside the

17

courtroom.

18

first day let be known to others that the courtroom is

19

closed, and others then don't plan to show up and -- and

20

don't even bother to come in.

21

I think the difficulty

It may be that those who were excluded the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could -- could I ask

22

you, though, there is a big difference between the

23

absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of

24

interest.

25

possibility of waiver or forfeiture -- the -- knowing

In both those situations, there's not a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

waiver or forfeiture because a conflicted counsel has

2

failed to tell someone a truth that they're conflicted

3

and gotten themselves off the case.

4

is the very essence of the violation.

5

MR. KIMBERLY:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Absence of counsel

Sure.
The defendant doesn't

7

know enough to object.

8

questions about waiver and forfeiture.

9

wouldn't it be in the best interest of every attorney to

But here there are serious
It's -- why

10

say, I didn't know that a closure was a constitutional

11

violation, the way this gentleman did?

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

13
14
15

Isn't that --

In -- in -- in circumstances

where that isn't actually the truth?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

In every

circumstance.

16

MR. KIMBERLY:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -In -- in virtually every

18

circumstance, the lawyer knows there's been a closure.

19

There's been plain error in his failure -- his or her

20

failure to object.

21

whether that waiver or forfeiture should or should not

22

be held against the defendant?

23

So how does the judge determine

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I think the same way

24

that the judge would do so in any case implicating a

25

Strickland claim based on a failure to object.

Alderson Reporting Company

The --

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

the threshold question is whether the attorney rendered

2

deficient performance.

3

at pages 7 and 8 of the Joint Appendix, there's no

4

question that the defense attorney here acknowledged

5

that the sole reason he declined to object to the

6

courtroom closure was he did not know that it was a

7

violation of his client's public trial right, and if he

8

had known, he would have raised an objection.

9

a -- I think a straightforward case of deficient

10
11

And in this case, for example,

That's

performance.
Now, it -- it's true the Commonwealth and

12

the United States have raised the possibility of

13

sandbagging in a circumstance where a defense counsel

14

who in fact does know about the violation of the right

15

and nevertheless declines to raise it to preserve the

16

possibility of bringing a Strickland claim later, but

17

that turns on the presumption that the defense attorney

18

would make a material represent -- misrepresentation to

19

the Court in later collateral proceedings, address it --

20

addressed at that -- at the question of the first prong,

21

whether he rendered deficient performance.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, why doesn't that

23

follow, though?

24

unpreserved error at trial and we get to appeal, you --

25

you have a choice.

Because it seems to me that if it's

In most cases, I see claims are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

dealt with collaterally.

2

plain error of question on direct appeal, but you have

3

to face prong 4 --

You could either bring it as a

4

MR. KIMBERLY:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Correct.
-- and show it affects the

6

integrity of the proceedings, or you have a choice.

7

could bring it in collateral proceedings where you

8

wouldn't have to meet prong 4, and it would actually be

9

easier to win a Sixth Amendment collateral claim than it

You

10

would be a plain error claim.

11

very unusual to me that we create a structure that would

12

incentivize, through honest and good advocacy, defines

13

the -- the normality of the final judgments.

14

question one.

15

And it -- it just seems

And question two is related.

So that's

Would we then

16

create actually a really perverse incentive for the

17

State to secure IEC waivers from individuals so that

18

they don't confront these kinds of problems, and

19

therefore, kind of a Professor Stunt sort of problem, by

20

perfecting procedure, we actually result in its denial

21

at all.

22

Can you help me with those two problems?

23

MR. KIMBERLY:

So the -- the question about

24

plain error, first, I think it depends on the

25

jurisdiction that you're in.

In this jurisdiction, for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1
2

example, Massachusetts -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

3

the typical jurisdiction.

4

little different.

5

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, work with me with

I know Massachusetts is a

Well, so there -- there are

6

groups of two.

7

most of the Federal courts fall into another budget.

8
9

Massachusetts falls into one bucket;

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Work with -- work with

the usual, the Federal jurisdiction, which is

10

predominant in most States, which is that IECs are done

11

collaterally.

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

And -- and, actually, I

13

appreciate it.

14

this is a collateral proceeding here, and I'm not --

I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't deny that

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

but, please, just -- just stick with me.

17

MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- I understand that,

So under Rule 54(b) in the

18

Federal proceeding -- in -- in the Federal context, this

19

would be Olano four-pronged plain error context, we --

20

we think it's true that, for the most part in the way

21

that the lower Federal courts have dealt with it, is

22

that the third prong -- effect on substantial rights, is

23

presumed when there is a structural error.

24

think, as a practical matter --

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And so, I

It's still a prong 4,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1
2

though, right?
MR. KIMBERLY:

It's still a prong 4.

And I

3

think that's why, for instance, there's an opportunity

4

for the Court to avoid sandbagging, if there's any

5

concern that the -- that the defense counsel knew about

6

it and kept the objection.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Defense counsel just

8

doesn't bring it -- doesn't bring it on direct appeal.

9

Good defence counsel wouldn't bring it, and would leave

10
11

it for collateral review in most jurisdictions.
MR. KIMBERLY:

Sure.

I mean, I think in

12

that circumstance, very frequently, plain error review

13

would be available.

14

I'm sorry to push back --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's available.

The

15

question is, wouldn't the judge be doing exactly what's

16

happening here?

17

prong, look at what actually happens, whether the

18

closure was complete, part of the trial, was there a

19

transcript of the voir dire --

Wouldn't the judge, under the fourth

20

MR. KIMBERLY:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Uh-huh.
-- so that they could

22

measure the possible effects or not, and end up saying

23

that the substantial integrity of the proceedings

24

haven't been violated?

25

Do you think that, as a matter of law, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

could overrule a finding of that nature, if it was in

2

direct review under plain error?

3

MR. KIMBERLY:

I think in most circumstances

4

in -- in -- where there's a structural error that passes

5

the third, it will almost always pass the fourth.

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. KIMBERLY:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

Oh, that's not the --

the lessons of our case law.

8

10

I --

Well, there's -- I -- I -I think reverse is true

of our case law.
MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- I don't mean to deny

12

that the fourth prong has -- has -- does real work.

13

It -- it certainly does, and there are case-specific

14

circumstances in which maybe then the appellate court

15

would decline to grant relief on collateral review,

16

and the defendant would, in that circumstance, be able

17

to bring a collateral challenge under Strickland.

18

The -- the one -- I just want to push back a

19

little bit on the hypothetical, because, in fact, there

20

are a number of State jurisdictions in which plain error

21

review of this sort isn't available at all because they

22

decline to presume prejudice on whatever the equivalent

23

of Olano prong 3 is, and Massachusetts is such a State.

24

And so in our case, in -- in any State court

25

jurisdiction where State courts have leeway to undertake

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

whatever plain error -- procedural plain error rules

2

they like, they aren't bound by this Court's or the

3

Federal courts' precedence on Rule 54(b).

4

very frequently do, say that you have to show actual

5

prejudice -- actual prejudice in the sort of Strickland

6

sense for relief under plain error.

7

They can, and

And in that circumstance, Strickland is a

8

critical, we think, relief valve.

9

of -- of getting later review in the circumstance where

It's the only way

10

the structural error perpetuated by the attorney's

11

deficient failure to object renders the trial

12

fundamentally unfair.

13

bears emphasis to recall that the Commonwealth does not

14

deny that if there were an objection in this case, the

15

defendants in this case, and in other cases like it,

16

would be entitled to a new trial automatically on direct

17

appeal.

18

And I -- I think it bears -- it

The Commonwealth does suggest putting that

19

error -- and -- and remember, structural errors go to

20

the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.

21

are the -- the gravest sort of constitutional errors

22

possible in the course of a criminal proceeding.

23

Putting that error together with the additional injury

24

of having been appointed counsel by the court, who's too

25

ignorant to know to object to the structural violation,

Alderson Reporting Company

They

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

that the defendant should be completely out of luck.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the

3

structural errors are not the most grievous errors

4

possible in the criminal process.

5

type of error, which the assumption is there's no way to

6

tell whether they're prejudicial or not.

7

this -- this may be a good case.

8

they're the most shocking miscarriages of justice you

9

can imagine.

MR. KIMBERLY:

They are a particular

But, I mean,

That doesn't mean

Well, I -- I don't think that

11

they're necessarily shocking, but I would say that this

12

Court's structural error precedents make clear that

13

although one feature of a structural error is that it's

14

impossible to -- to determine the practical

15

consequences, it is an independent feature of structural

16

errors that they render the trials fundamentally unfair.

17

The idea is that the rights that are

18

protected by the structural error doctrine are just

19

essential elements to a fair trial.

23

picking good ones, but, I mean, I -- I can come up with

a long list of things that I think are more serious

violations than the exclusion of the public from voir

2

understand that that is an error, and I -- the argument,

of course, that it is a structural error; but I'm just

quarreling with the idea that these are the most

grievous miscarriages of -- of justice you can imagine.

I

There are particular characteristics of them

that put them in a different category.

MR. KIMBERLY:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the --

And -A list of errors

10

that could occur in criminal procedure, I think you'd

11

agree, there's some that you would put ahead of

excluding members of the public from voir dire when the

courtroom is otherwise full.

MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- I -- and I didn't mean

15

to suggest or -- or overstate the grievousness of the

error.

17

category of errors where the Court recognizes that their

18

denial -- that the denial of the rights protected by

19

this doctrine render the proceeding automatically

20

suspect and -- and inherently unfair.

22

What I meant to suggest is that these are a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, you don't have to convince us of that, do you?

23

MR. KIMBERLY:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

But, in a way, Mr. Kimberly,

I -- I hope not.
Yeah.

No.

I'm saying you

don't have to convince us, because -- because one of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

things that we've said over and over about structural

2

error is that it's -- it's impossible to show how they

3

affected the trial.

4

MR. KIMBERLY:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
And -- and that's really

6

what's at issue here, is whether we should put the

7

defendant to the burden of showing how it affected the

8

trial, when, in fact, we've said over and over that you

9

can't do that.

10

MR. KIMBERLY:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think -So whether they're

12

important, whether they're not important, whether

13

they're critical to fundamental fairness or not, you

14

know, is, in some ways, beside the point.

15

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -- so I think there

16

are two independent ways of thinking about it, and that

17

certainly is -- is one very important way of thinking

18

about it.

19

briefing, and I -- I think that's absolutely right.

20

This is the point about putting two wrongs together and

21

just saying --

22

It's something that we stress in our

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it's not a question of

23

putting two wrongs together.

24

argument and the argument of the United States is that

25

there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment right to

I mean, the Commonwealth's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

counsel unless the -- the counsel's performance deprived

2

the defendant of a -- a fair trial.

3

a Sixth Amendment speedy trial -- I'm sorry --

4

public-trial act issue.

5

And prejudice is built into the Sixth Amendment

6

Strickland standard because the defendant had an

7

attorney.

8
9

It's -- this is not

It's a right-to-counsel issue.

So on what theory was the defendant deprived
of an attorney?

Well, the theory is, although there was

10

somebody sitting next to that defendant and asking

11

questions and pretending to be an attorney, that

12

attorney was so bad that he might as well not have had

13

an attorney.

14

ultimately, there has to be the determination for there

15

to be a Sixth Amendment right-to-trial violation that

16

there was prejudice.

17

So it's built right in.

And so,

Now, you can make the argument that it's

18

impossible to tell whether there was prejudice, but it's

19

built right into the speedy -- into the -- a right to

20

counsel.

21
22
23

MR. KIMBERLY:
right.

I -- I think that's exactly

I wouldn't disagree with anything you said.
But that leads me to the second point that I

24

was going to make, and that's that Strickland instructs

25

that the fundamental focus of the ineffective assistance

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

inquiry has to be on the fundamental fairness of the

2

trial.

3

understand the two steps, it's whether there was

4

deficient performance, objectively unreasonable

5

performance, and whether that objectively unreasonable

6

error, in turn, rendered the trial unfair.

If, therefore, the -- the two -- as we

7

Now, in the mine run of cases, we do not

8

disagree.

9

errors, the way to prove that the error rendered the

In the mine run of cases involving trial

10

trial fundamentally unfair is to show that it was

11

sufficiently serious that it undermined our confidence

12

in the result.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -- and you have to say

14

that that's always true, or it's -- it's true in such a

15

high percentage of the cases that there's no point in

16

even making that an issue, no matter how steep the

17

burden that the prosecution might have to satisfy.

18

MR. KIMBERLY:

That -- that is -- that is

19

the reasoning underlying Cronic.

20

different from what we're suggesting here.

21

suggesting here is that the rights protected by

22

structural errors are fundamental to the American system

23

of criminal justice, and that their denial renders the

24

trial fundamentally and inherently suspect, and

25

therefore, unfair.

I think it's somewhat

Alderson Reporting Company

What we're

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

And so it is simply another way to prove

2

that a defense attorney's objectively unreasonable error

3

rendered the trial unfair to show that it resulted in a

4

structural error.

5

structural error that it does exactly that, that it

6

renders the trial unfair.

7

It is the -- it is the hallmark of a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's put this label aside

8

for a minute.

9

that there can never be a case where a violation like

You really think that it's impossible,

10

the one that took place here had no effect on the

11

outcome of the trial?

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

Again, I -It's impossible to ever --

for there ever to be such a case --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's a different --

12

I mean, that's a different situation.

13

people who wanted to go -- the only members of the

14

public who wanted to be in this -- in the courtroom were

15

the family and the friends of the victims of a crime.

16

So it would be a hostile audience.

17

MR. KIMBERLY:

Suppose the only

I -- I think -- I think that

18

would implicate many of the same problems that we have

19

here.

20

individuals would have been affected by their presence.

There's no way to tell the ways in which

21

It -- it very well may be that that would

22

have cast a defendant in worse light, but there's no way

23

to know.

24

would be off-put by what they viewed as -- as especially

25

egregious behavior in that circumstance.

Maybe some members of -- of the jury venire

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

The point is, it -- it remains a speculative

2

inquiry.

3

the -- I think the -- the Court's cases on this point

4

really leave very little doubt that, as far as -- as

5

denial of the public trial right goes, there's no way to

6

tell what the difference is.

7

And -- and I think, as -- as we've suggested,

And if, in order to obtain relief, we

8

require defendants to prove what the difference is,

9

it -- it means that, just as a practical matter, there

10

will never be relief for violations of the public trial

right that happen to be coupled with the additional

12

injury of defense counsel who don't know to object.

13

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL E. RAVITZ

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19

MR. RAVITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

The claim before the Court is one of

21

ineffective assistance of counsel, and requiring

22

individualized prejudice to be proven for claims like

23

that, claims like the Petitioner's, ensures that a

24

criminal judgment is not vacated unless a violation of

25

the right to effective counsel is complete.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

It tells us whether the defendant's own

2

conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversarial

3

process, or was likely the -- the right outcome.

4

keeps us from upsetting judgments based on attorney

5

errors that had no impact on the verdict.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it

Supposing this objection

7

had been made at the first opportunity and it's denied

8

by the trial judge.

9

there was a timely objection.

And then it goes up on appeal.

Wouldn't it follow, then,

10

that the case has to be -- the judgment has to be

11

vacated and there has to be a retrial?

12

MR. RAVITZ:

So

Assuming the judge's decision

13

was improper, yes, that -- that's what would happen in

14

Massachusetts.

15

And -- and it's important to recognize the distinction

16

between those two situations, because there are both

17

doctrinal and practical considerations there.

18

But that -- that wasn't the case here.

The doctrinal ones are that now we are

trial.

2

Strickland tells us --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Unless it's a -- unless the

4

fact that it's a structural error is fatal, then in the

5

situation -- in -- in the hypothetical Justice Ginsburg

6

provided, wouldn't it be open to you to prove that it

7

was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt?

8
9

MR. RAVITZ:

That's -- that's correct if --

if it was not a structural error.

But if it's -- if

10

it's a structural error, then -- then the government

11

would be precluded from making that -- that showing.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what's -- and what --

13

is there a structural error in this case, in your view,

14

under the hypothetical?

15

MR. RAVITZ:

Where -- where there was an

16

improper closure of the trial, we -- we respect the fact

17

that -- or I should say of jury selection -- we respect

18

the fact that the Court has said that public trial

19

errors are structural, and that the Court has said that

20

the closure of jury selection is a public trial error.

21

However, not all structural errors should be

22

treated the same, and not all public trial errors should

23

be treated the same.

24

from one another.

25

They're -- they're very different

There could be a closure for --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And under Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

Ginsburg's hypothetical, there's an objection, the

2

objection is overruled, it's wrongly overruled.

3

then you say, well, in Massachusetts, we would -- there

4

would be a reversal.

5

What about under the law of the

6

Constitution?

7

that hypothetical?

8
9

And

Must there be a reversal on the facts of

MR. RAVITZ:

The -- this Court in Presley

did not address remedies.

So if -- if one takes Presley

10

combined with statements about a public trial error

11

being a structural error, takes them together, then --

12

then yes.

But the fact is the Court has never expressly

13

said that.

It has never said that a Presley error is a

14

structural error.

15

And -- and even if it were to be a

16

structural error, that doesn't mean that it should be

17

treated like every other structural error, or even like

18

every other public trial error.

19

As I said, the courtroom closure could be

20

for a few minutes during --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

Yes, but what -- what's

your line?

23

MR. RAVITZ:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

that the structural error were excluding

Excuse me?
I mean, do you -- suppose

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

African-Americans from the jury, or women from the jury.

2

Okay?

3

All white men.

4

that made a real difference in that case.

5

know.

That's the error.

They select a different jury.

Now, we have no way of knowing whether
We don't

So it's a structural error.

6

Now, are you saying in such a circumstance,

7

where the lawyer failed to object, et cetera, therefore

8

Strickland, therefore inadequate assistance of counsel,

9

that that isn't the end of it?

That there was an all

10

white male jury?

11

we don't know if there was prejudice in the sense that

12

the jury would have decided differently?

13

position?

14
15

Isn't that the end of it, even though

MR. RAVITZ:

Is that your

It is our position that

prejudice would need to be proven.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

can't.

18

out differently.

You can't.

All right?

You

You can't prove that the jury would have come

19

So I'd say, at least in my mind, if your

20

point is that even -- suppose they had a -- a trial by

21

inquisition.

22

most fantastic examples where you don't know whether,

23

really, the result would have been every -- different if

24

you had the most perfect jury.

25

I mean, you know, I can imagine even the

All right?

Now, you're saying either there -- the --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

somebody has to prove that it really made a difference?

2

That's what a structural error is really about, that

3

kind of case, where you can't prove it because it was a

4

basically unfair proceeding.

5
6

MR. RAVITZ:
that --

7
8

Well, the Court hasn't said

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I don't care what the

Court said.

9

MR. RAVITZ:

10

Okay.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm asking my question.

11

And my question, I thought, until I'm getting this

12

answer, that, of course, in some instances, you say it

13

was such an unfair trial, and you show inadequate

14

assistance of counsel and that's the end of it.

15

presume the prejudice.

16

you draw the line.

17

You

And I was going to ask you how

MR. RAVITZ:

Right.

It may be an unfair

18

trial with respect to the right that's claimed at issue,

19

but where the right that's claimed is one of ineffective

20

assistance, Strickland tells us that that -- that deals

21

with --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not interested in

23

Strickland at the moment.

24

in this case, we should draw the line between those

25

structural errors, which are absolutely egregious, and

I want to know how you think,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

it is plain that the defendant did not get a fair trial,

2

although we cannot prove one way or the other that it

3

would have made a difference to the outcome.

4

MR. RAVITZ:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -I -- I would have thought

6

that you would have said, of course, in such a case,

7

inadequate assistance of counsel for not raising that

8

error leads to a new trial.

9

if you're not going to say that, then I will withdraw

10

We presume prejudice.

And

all my questions and keep quiet.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. RAVITZ:

I will say that the -- the

13

Court's approach in Cronic made sense, that there what

14

the Court said was prejudice would be presumed where

15

it's highly likely that there was, in fact, prejudice,

16

and not just any type of prejudice, but prejudice in the

17

sense of a breakdown in the adversary process; in other

18

words, prejudice to the right at issue because of

19

circumstances on the order of a -- of a complete denial

20

of counsel.

21

And I say that makes sense because by

22

focusing on the likelihood, the high likelihood, we are

23

not saying that something actually existed merely

24

because we don't know whether it existed.

25

that it existed when we can be very confident that it

Alderson Reporting Company

We are saying

Official - Subject to Final Review

33

did.

2

zeroing in on what is before --

And by focusing on the right at issue, we are

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. RAVITZ:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the Court.
So the rule that you're

6

asking us to adopt today, Cronic said an absolute

7

absence of counsel, you presume prejudice.

8

further said that a conflict of interest, actual

9

conflict of interest, you can presume prejudice.

10

We have

Would an absolute closure, improper closure

11

of a courtroom for no reason, could we presume prejudice

12

there, or would you require the proof of actual

13

prejudice the way you're advocating here?

14

MR. RAVITZ:

Yes.

We would say that actual

15

prejudice needs to be shown, that a presumption is

16

inappropriate.

17

those situations where, again, it -- it can be said with

18

confidence -- and this isn't just the approach taken

in -- in Cronic.

20

variety of errors.

21

because something is difficult to show, we are going to,

22

for example, relieve the government --

23

That a presumption is appropriate in

Cronic cited cases dealing with a
Because it's one thing to say that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's wrong -- wouldn't

24

it be logical to say that there are -- that structural

25

errors on the reliability of a trial are affected by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

quality of the violation?

2

as it may be, is not the same as a total closure.

3

in a total situation, the reliability of the trial is

4

put into question in a such a fundamental way that

5

prejudice can be presumed.

6
7

And

Otherwise, we're never going to make any
meaning of structural error.

8
9

A partial closure, improper

MR. RAVITZ:

Well, but -- but the

reliability that Strickland and Cronic talked about is

10

where the result of the trial is rendered unreliable

11

because of a breakdown in -- in the -- the adversary

12

process, so it focuses in on the heart of the right at

13

issue.

14

The Petitioner here could have pursued a

15

standalone public-trial claim, and then we would be

16

talking about the rights underlying that.

17

v. Morrison says it's important to look at the values

18

underlying the right that has been asserted.

19

So Kimmelman

But the -- but the Petitioner didn't do

20

that.

He didn't do it in the SJC and he didn't do it

21

here.

So instead the focus should be on the values

22

underlying the -- the right to the assistance of counsel

23

and whether there's been a breakdown in the adversary

24

process.

25

fair trial, that Strickland says the Counsel Clause is

That's the specific aspect of fairness, of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

about.

2

Had the Petitioner pursued a standalone

3

claim for the rights -- for violation of the

4

public-trial right, even though it was forfeited in

5

Massachusetts, it would have gotten a review because all

6

claims are reviewed in Massachusetts, just under a

7

different standard.

8
9

And, in fact, if -- looking at the way that
Massachusetts has treated those standalone claims versus

10

ineffectiveness claims, it's clear that Massachusetts

11

understands what this Court said in -- in Kimmelman.

12

Because in one case, in a case called Celester, the

13

Commonwealth, via the SJC, was applying its substantial

14

likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard to an

15

ineffectiveness claim based on this kind of a closure.

16

And it -- and it cited -- it quoted Strickland.

17

But in another case where it was focusing on

18

the underlying right, it talked about public-trial

19

theory, even as it applied the same standard of review.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Ravitz, I don't

21

know, maybe this is a simple-minded way to look at

22

things, but I've always thought Strickland, it's about

23

the fairness and the reliability of the trial process.

24

And that's a pretty important thing to be concerned

25

about.

And we have said as part of Strickland that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

have to show prejudice, because we're not really

2

concerned about lawyers, however bad they may be, who do

3

things that just don't affect the reliability of the

4

trial.

5

But here, with respect to these structural

6

errors, what we've said again and again and again is we

7

actually just don't know.

8

case, whether the commission of this error affected the

9

outcome.

10

So the -- in any particular

So what you are suggesting to us is that the

11

defendant has to come in and prove as part of

12

Strickland -- which, as I said, is integral to ensuring

13

the fairness and reliability of the process -- has to

14

come in and prove as part of that something that we have

15

said, time and again, is unprovable.

16

seems like that's not something that a legal system

17

should do.

18

admitted is unprovable.

19

MR. RAVITZ:

And that just

You have to prove something that we've

Well, when the Court said that

it was difficult to prove prejudice from this kind of

error, it wasn't talking about the reasonable

24

to account for and does account for situations where

That's one of the

in such a way that we're saying this terrible attorney

error took place because we're assuming that.

think it might -- it could have affected the outcome of

13

the trial, but because of the kind of error it is, as

we've said a hundred times, we just are not able to --

Kafkaesque to me.

MR. RAVITZ:

Well, I wouldn't even say

It's like you have to prove

We've

10

MR. RAVITZ:

The -- the Court hasn't said it

11

about a reasonable probability standard.

12

that it -- it -- a reasonable probability can't be

13

shown.

14

It hasn't said

And -- and as far as proving it, there are

15

analogous situations where what we see is that the party

16

shows a connection between the error.

17

here, the closure, the spectators that are excluded, and

18

the events that occurred during that time taking into

19

account what's said in the trial transcripts, and a

20

connection between those things and the issues at trial,

21

giving particular attention to anything that went wrong

22

and also giving attention to -- as I say, to likelihood,

23

to probability.

24
25

So let's say

And so the -- for example, the Solicitor
General cites the McKernan Third Circuit case that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

handed down this year, which involved a biased judge.

2

And that's -- that's the approach that the Court took

3

there.

4

happened, what went wrong, and what the connection was

5

between that and the error and then the -- the

6

probability that it had an effect on the judgment.

It was very simple.

7

It was to look at what

And sometimes -- sometimes that's the best

8

that we can do, but it's because we are inherently

9

considering what would have happened in a different

10

situation.

That's the case in every Strickland

11

situation.

We're always considering what would have

12

happened.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's say, I

14

mean, the argument on the other side is that one of the

15

most important things about the trial is to have the

16

mother with the young offender.

17

prejudice or not, that the mother wasn't there?

18

just looked and there was a guy alone who was accused of

19

killing a 15-year-old, as opposed to a troubled youth

20

with his mother holding his hand.

21

these things are important.

22
23
24
25

Did that cause
They

I mean, you know, all

trial or not?

As to whether it had an effect on the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. RAVITZ:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Yeah.

-- that's something different.
Well, how do you

prove it?

7

MR. RAVITZ:

Well, again, the -- the -- a

8

defendant can aim to show a connection between the

9

spectators and what happened at the trial.

So, for

10

example, let's say the judge made certain comments that

11

were offensive about a particular group, and members of

12

that group were excluded from jury selection.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

case.

16

Yeah, that's a

I'm asking -- I'm asking about this

MR. RAVITZ:

The defendant probably would

17

have had a great difficulty showing it because it was so

18

likely to have occurred, but that doesn't mean that

19

there was a breakdown in the system.

20

the prejudice that Strickland and Cronic called for was

21

just highly unlikely to have been present.

22

And why do I say that?

That means that

Because the

23

courtroom was filled with as many as 90 members of the

24

public in the form of prospective jurors who were able

25

to observe the proceedings, and because there was no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41

evidence taken and there was no argumentation on the

2

merits and because once the courtroom -- once the jury

3

selection process was finished, the courtroom was opened

up.

5

the -- of the jury selection proceeding or the jury that

6

was chosen.

7

then when it was opened up, the jurors heard evidence of

8

a confession.

9

biological evidence and ballistics evidence.

And there was no issue raised about the rest of

It was only the courtroom closure.

And

And they heard other evidence of -- of
So yes,

10

here, it was just highly unlikely that there was, in

11

fact, prejudice.

12

Just on a final note, it's -- it's been said

13

that structural errors are the gravest type of errors.

14

And this Court in Gonzalez Lopez redirected things and

15

clarified that structural errors are, in fact,

16

different, and they've been rendered structural, given

17

that classification for different reasons.

18

important to focus on those differences just as

19

Strickland says it's important to focus on the different

circumstances in a given case.

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

6

I'd like to begin where my co-counsel just

7

left off here with the idea that any time a structural

8

error occurs, it leads to fundamental unfairness and

9

unreliability in the outcome of the trial.

Structural

10

errors implicate fairness in a way that's broader than

11

the interest that's protected by the Sixth Amendment

right to the effective assistance of counsel.

13

Under Strickland, we're focused on whether

counsel's error undermines confidence in the -- in the

verdict.

breakdown in the adversarial process that we can no

17

longer rely on what the jury did.

structural errors are necessarily the type of error that

20

undermine confidence in the reliability of the trial.

You're asking whether there was such a

concluded that those errors do not undermine the

reliability of the trial outcomes:

Batson errors, right

43
1

In the context of Batson errors, which you

2

were talking a little bit about before, we have cited

3

some cases in page 18 and 19 of our brief where courts

4

of appeals have looked at cases where Batson errors

5

occurred and said, okay.

6

consider that a structural error, but it didn't

7

undermine our -- our confidence in the outcome of this

8

trial.

9

There's no reason to believe that any juror that was

10

actually sitting on the jury had any kind of a bias.

11

There was a Batson error.

There was overwhelming evidence of guilt.

And those decisions are consistent with this

between the -- the examples that you gave where -- where

2

it would appear that the issue would be a question of

3

harmless error, and the situation here, where the

4

question is whether there's a constitutional error at

5

all?

6

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well -- so I think that this

case has been litigated on the assumption that there has

been a constitutional error, a -- a Sixth Amendment

9

violation of the public power.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

But that's not the

11

error that's -- that is before us.

12

alleged error that's before us is a violation --

very clear.

address is the right to counsel; am I right?

22

MS. O'CONNELL:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

the right to counsel based purely on deficient

25

performance; isn't that right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

MS. O'CONNELL:

Correct.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

So there has to be -- the

3

prejudice prong has to be satisfied.

4

MS. O'CONNELL:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I thought your

6

understanding of Batson was that you were saying when an

7

attorney is deficient, as respects to a Batson claim,

8

there, too, you would say that -- sort of too bad.

9

MS. O'CONNELL:

Yes.

But you -- you still

10

must satisfy the prejudice prong in order to rerun the

trial.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

So your -- your examples

13

were ineffective assistance of counsel cases, not just

14

Batson cases.

would be if -- you know, if the attorney didn't object,

violation of the ineffective assistance claim.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I think on that point,

2

Justice Kagan, the idea that you can't prove prejudice,

3

the Court said it's difficult to do.

4

as a general matter; it's not true across the board.

5

We've cited cases in our brief with respect to the bias

6

trial judge structural error, for example, where courts

7

have done a case-by-case inquiry and said, okay.

8

this case, the bias of the trial judge, there is a

9

reasonable probability it would have affected the trial

10

outcome.

11

probability that it would have.

12
13
14

That may be true

In

In this case, there is no reasonable

And it's not -- the -- the burden of proof
in the Strickland context is on the defendant -JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, I'm not saying

15

that there aren't cases where you can have a sort of gut

16

intuition as to whether it did or not.

17

things that have made us put these particular rights in

18

this box called "structural" is that we say, you know,

19

notwithstanding that you can pick out a case here and

20

there and say, okay.

21

But one of the

I kind of know.

In general, these are -- it is so

22

speculative as to whether this fundamental defect in the

23

trial process caused error that we're going to -- to --

24

to presume it.

25

MS. O'CONNELL:

And -- and so that, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

Kagan, is the rationale for -- for not letting the

2

government prove harmless error if the objection is

3

preserved.

4

interests -- a lot of these interests are ones that

5

would not adequately be protected if that rule was not

6

dispensed with in the harmless-error context for

7

preserved objections.

8
9

And I think a big part of that is that these

I think the most stark example is a
McCaskill error, the right to represent yourself, where

10

if we didn't exempt that type of an error from

11

harmless-error analysis, it would always be harmless,

12

because the judge could just deny the motion and then

13

say, well, there was no prejudice because you would

14

have -- you would have been worse off representing

15

yourself.

16

In the Strickland prejudice, the -- the

17

tables are turned and the defendant has the burden to

18

prove that there was some sort -- there was a reasonable

19

probability of a different outcome at trial had this

20

error been objected to and been fixed.

21

there's just no reasonable probability of that in this

22

particular case.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And there's --

I don't think we've ever

24

really talked about burdens when we label things

25

structural errors.

You know, we don't say, oh, you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

haven't met your burden.

2

that the whole burden analysis kind of goes out the

3

window because this is so hard to prove because it's so

4

speculative.

5

I mean, what we've said is

So it's really not a question of who has the

6

burden.

7

the structural error category.

8
9

It's just never been the way we've addressed

MS. O'CONNELL:

I -- I think in -- in

Strickland, it's clear that the -- the -- proving each

10

prong of Strickland deficient performance and prejudice

11

is on the defendant.

12

position that even though it's difficult to prove -- I

13

mean, the test is not meant to be easy.

14

to identify cases where the error, the attorney's

15

error --

16

And so, I guess, it is our

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We're looking

Well, it's not meant to be

17

easy, but it's meant to be possible.

18

said in our structural error cases is that it's not

19

possible in a very, very large proportion of them.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

And what we've

Well, I guess I'd like to

21

push back on that a little bit, though, and -- I mean, I

22

could give an example in the public-trial context in

23

specific where, you know, a lot of times when this

24

particular right is at issue or is violated, it's with

25

respect to the courtroom closure for one witness, say an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

undercover police officer, a rape victim, a child, or

2

something like that.

3

And if -- you know, if the courtroom is

4

closed for that witness's testimony and there's no

5

objection, and on appeal, the -- the court of appeals

6

says, oh, well, that was a -- that courtroom closure was

7

unjustified under the Waller factors.

8

witness didn't testify or wouldn't have testified to

9

those things but for the courtroom closure, you could

And if that

10

absolutely evaluate that and see if there was a

11

reasonable likelihood the trial would have come out

12

differently had that witness not testified.

13

So I -- I don't think it's the case that --

14

it may be a general rule across the board that

15

structural errors are difficult to prove, but I don't

16

think it's true in every case.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the difficulty in

18

any particular case something that can be weighed in

19

determining whether the defendant has carried his burden

20

of showing prejudice?

21

I mean, in some of these, you say -- I guess

22

we haven't required in some Batson cases, I think it

23

would be -- that's where I do think it would be almost

24

impossible to put the burden on showing prejudice.

25

the other hand, denial of counsel of choice, I would

Alderson Reporting Company

On

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

think that would be pretty easy to show whether there's

2

prejudice or -- or not, right?

3

Is that something a judge, reviewing whether

4

there's been an adequate showing of prejudice, can take

5

into account, or is it all or nothing?

6

MS. O'CONNELL:

7

In Strickland, I think it's page 459 of

I -- no, I think so.

8

Strickland, the Court describes the test for how to do a

9

case-by-case prejudice inquiry under Strickland.

And

10

the Court looks to, was the evidence against this

11

defendant overwhelming.

12

pervasive, in that it affected everything that happened

13

in the trial, or was it just limited to one particular

14

witness or one particular thing.

15

Was the error that occurred

So I think, you know, under Strickland, the

16

test is flexible enough that courts could take into

17

consideration what type of an error it was.

That's correct, Your Honor.

19

That question is answered by Waller itself, which said

20

that it's the proceeding itself that's closed that has

21

to be redone.

22

during an entire jury empanelment is that the jury

23

empanelment has to happen again.

24

jury empaneled behind closed doors is not a fair jury.

25

And so it's the same sort of analysis that might arise

And so the upshot of a courtroom closure

The idea is that a

2

constituted, the trial has to take --

3

The jury, not being fairly

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about using it -- if

4

we're going to distinguish among substantial -- among

5

structural errors, taking the standard out of Allano and

6

saying those that seriously affect the fairness,

7

integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings,

8

if the -- if the procedural -- if the structural error

9

rises to meet that standard, then -- then you don't have

10

to show prejudice.

11

better.

12

this proceeding which can come up in the -- in a

13

collateral proceeding.

14

But if it doesn't, then you'd

Now, that would harmonize the plain error and

MR. KIMBERLY:

15

say a couple things that --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18
19

Yes.

So -- so I wanted to

What do you think about

that?
MR. KIMBERLY:

I don't think that there's a

basis in this Court's structural error precedence --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KIMBERLY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, that's true.
-- for drawing -But you're asking us --

24

category, and -- and period, and that's it.

25

Just take structural error as your

MR. KIMBERLY:

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now, but they --

2

they want -- and they want to go to the other extreme,

3

basically.

4

about that as a standard?

5

MR. KIMBERLY:

But if we're cutting this child in two, what

I -- I guess it's, at least

6

as we understand what this Court has said about

7

structural errors, which is that they undermine -- and I

8

should say, in particular, the public-trial right, which

9

goes to the very perception of the judiciary by the

10

public and -- and undermines, in our view, certainly,

11

and this Court said in Richmond Newspapers and

12

Press-Enterprises, that courtroom closures -- and those

13

cases, by the way, were --

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But that's the third

15

prong.

16

with respect.

17

it doesn't get you home in an unpreserved error case.

18

You still have to meet the fourth prong.

19

You're not answering Justice Breyer's question,
That gets you past the third prong, but

MR. KIMBERLY:

That's true.

To be clear,

20

though, I mean, I think that would be true in a trial

21

error context as well.

That's just to say that the --

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

MR. KIMBERLY:

Right.

-- the two tests don't

24

overlap.

25

will be available on collateral review under Strickland,

And so, yes, it is true that sometimes relief

even where it is not available on direct review under a

2

plain error standard.

3

But I -- I think that's --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Doesn't that seem highly

4

unlikely?

5

important, but it isn't automatically a winner every

6

single time if you don't preserve it.

7

MR. KIMBERLY:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

I mean, a structural error, we think is

May I answer?
Please.

That's right, Your Honor.

I

10

don't think there's anything particularly unseemly about

11

that, because, again, that is exactly how the Court

12

approaches the exact same question in the context of

13

trial errors.

14

affects substantial rights and yet, it gets filtered out

15

at prong 4 of the Allano test --

It may be that a forfeited trial error

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

17

MR. KIMBERLY:

Thank you.

-- and -- and so that could

18

be raised on a Strickland basis, and counsel could

19

obtain -- the defendant could obtain relief in that

20

context.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

The case is submitted.
