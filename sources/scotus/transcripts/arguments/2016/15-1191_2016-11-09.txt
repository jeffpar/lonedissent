ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States Constitution does not

12

confer U.S. citizenship on anyone born outside the

13

United States.

14

authority under Article I of the Constitution, it is for

15

Congress to determine which categories of such persons

16

should be granted U.S. citizenship by statute.

17

Rather, pursuant to its plenary

In doing so, Congress has always required

18

that the persons involved have a demonstrated and

19

sufficient connection to the United States, either in

20

themselves or through their parents, to warrant the

21

conferral of citizenship, because citizenship carries

22

with it attendant duties and rights on the part of the

23

individual, and important duties of protection and

24

obligation on the part of the United States government.

25

This case concerns the framework under the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as originally

2

enacted for granting citizenship to persons outside the

3

United States as of the date of their birth.

4

Other provisions deal with the granting of

5

citizenship later in life.

6

Respondent or his father in this case, but were not

7

taken advantage of.

9

Those were open to

In particular, this case concerns the
granting of citizenship to children born out of wedlock

10

abroad, a situation in which this Court's -- this

11

Court's cases made clear that mothers and fathers are

12

not typically similarly situated with respect to their

13

legal status concerning the child at the moment of

14

birth.

15

The general rules for citizenship at birth

16

are set out in 8 U.S.C. 1401.

17

Act as originally enacted; it was revised in 1986.

18

both parents were U.S. citizens, then a child born

19

outside the United States would be a citizen of the

20

United States as long as one of the parents had resided

21

in the United States for any period of time.

22

did not deem that to be a sufficient connection to the

23

United States, given that both parents are citizens.

24
25

And I'm referring to the
If

Congress

On the other hand, if one parent was a U.S.
citizen and one parent was an alien, Congress had a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

markedly different approach.

The U.S.-citizen parent

2

had to -- had to have resided in the United States for

3

ten years, five of which were after reaching the age of

4

14.

5

child would have competing claims of allegiance, that a

6

greater residency was -- was required for the parent to

7

establish the connection to the United States.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

we heard much about in the Flores-Villar case?

Congress evidently determined that because such a

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Is that an argument

It was -- it was made at the

11

oral argument in -- in Flores-Villar, and -- but we

12

think it's also evident from the face of the statute.

13

As this Court said in Nguyen with respect to another

14

argument that the -- that the Court addressed there,

15

it's important for the Court itself to look at the -- at

16

the structure, text, and operation of the statute to see

17

that the --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought, in Villar,

19

the -- the government spent most of its argument talking

20

about the differential treatment primarily on the

21

grounds of statelessness.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.
And -- and here your

24

argument is -- the thrust of your argument is -- is

25

somewhat a different need to ensure sufficient ties.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

What -- we're making both

2

arguments.

3

Flores-Villar that there should be a connection to the

4

United States and that the statutory framework is set up

5

that way.

6

And -- and we did -- we did argue in

It's true that our emphasis was on

7

statelessness, but we are now arguing -- and, again, we

8

think it's -- it's entirely evident from the face of the

9

statute -- that what -- what these provisions are after

10
11

is connection to the United States.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why aren't men and women

12

who are parents similarly situated with respect to their

13

affiliation, their attachment to U.S. values?

14

there's no reason to think a man is less -- has less of

15

a sense of U.S. belonging than a woman?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

I mean,

And we're -- and

17

we're making no such argument.

18

where you have -- where you have -- at the -- at the

19

moment of birth, the mother, as -- as this Court

20

recognized in the -- in the Nguyen case and has

21

recognized in cases like Lehr v. Robertson in the

22

domestic context, the mother is the only legally

23

recognized parent.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the point is that

There are many cases,

especially generations back when this law was on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

books, where the mother -- the birth certificate came

2

sometime after the child was born, and both the father's

3

name and the mother's name might be on it.

4

So it is -- it is not -- the moment of birth

5

doesn't necessarily tell you who is the mother if she --

6

if there is no birth certificate, and then the child,

7

when they get the birth certificate, both names are on

8

it.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

But I -- I think this Court's

10

decision in Nguyen and the -- and the State statutes

11

that we identify in a footnote in our brief are premised

12

on -- on the proposition that the identity of the mother

13

and her relationship to the child will be known by

14

virtue of the birth alone, or at least will be known in

15

the overwhelming majority of cases.

16

In that situation there is only one parent.

17

There is not a competing claim of citizenship to -- a

18

competing claim of allegiance to another country through

19

another parent.

20

On the other hand, when the father

21

legitimates, at that point you have two parents, and

22

it -- in the situation where they are of different

23

nationalities, then you are put in the situation where

24

there are competing claims --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why do we look,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth?

2

look to the moment when citizenship is sought?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why shouldn't we

Because this -- this

4

statutory provision specifically deals with citizenship

5

at birth, and the -- the statute that that's its

6

caption, of 1409(a), with respect to the situation where

7

the father legitimates, says the child shall be a

8

citizen as of birth, and it's important to understand

9

exactly what is operating here.

10

At -- at the moment of birth, again, the

11

child only has one -- one parent.

12

legitimates, what Congress has done generously, one

13

could say, but at least sensibly, is to say we will

14

treat the couple as if they were married at the moment

15

of birth.

16

the legitimation so that the -- so that the children --

17

the child is treated as the child of married parents at

18

that point.

19

When the father

They are giving retroactive application to

If the -- if the legitimating father is a

20

U.S. citizen, in that situation you would have two

21

U.S.-citizen parents, and the very generous rule for

22

U.S.-citizen parents would apply in that -- in that

23

situation.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But Nguyen -- Nguyen was

more a matter of -- of proof, whereas this case, as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

Justice Ginsburg indicates, is a question of which --

2

does the child have sufficient ties to the country.

3

It's quite a different -- quite a different proposition

4

that the two address, it seems to me.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Two -- two things about that.

6

This Court's decision in Nguyen had two -- had

7

identified two separate interests.

8

paternity, and -- but the other was recognizing the

9

connection to the United States.

10

One was the proof of

The connection to the United States in a

11

situation like this has two steps:

12

relationship of the child to the parent?

13

concerned about establishing that relationship, that

14

in -- in some formal sense and also underlying it, a

15

real sense of establishing that relationship.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, not under the 1952 Act.

2

Under the -- that was true under the 1940 Act.

3

the 1952 Act, it's continuous presence for one year, but

4

Congress deemed that to be basically somewhere in

5

between the two U.S.-citizen parents situation in which

6

any period of residency was okay and the mixed -- the

7

mixed nationality situation where Congress said it had

8

to be ten and five.

9

somewhere in between.

10

Under

Congress chose a -- a period

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why should it be

11

different for an unwed father who has legitimized the

12

child?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Because in that situation

14

there are two parents.

15

father's ties are less.

16

ties, and Congress wanted to make sure that the -- that

17

the strength of the U.S. citizen's ties were sufficient

18

that they would outweigh or at least counteract where

19

Congress could be sufficiently confident of the tie to

20

the United States to grant citizenship in that -- in

21

that situation.

22

The argument is not that the
It's that there are competing

And again --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why couldn't that have been

23

done, Mr. Kneedler?

Why couldn't these objectives have

24

been served through entirely gender neutral language?

25

For example, I know that there was a proposal that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was

2

passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal

3

parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at

4

all.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

Several things about

6

that.

7

Respondent would benefit from reading the statute in

8

that manner, because I -- I don't think there's any

9

question that he had citizenship and a legal parent when

10

I don't think there is a claim in this case that

he was born.

11

But beyond -- beyond that --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That would get rid of the

13

gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint.

14

Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the

15

question here is whether the statute makes --

16

constitutes a violation of equal protection.

17

One question we ask when we think about a

18

question like that is, could Congress have written the

19

statute?

20

an entirely gender neutral way?

21

here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a

22

statute to Congress that actually did that.

23

Could Congress have served its objectives in

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

And it seems as though

But it -- but as was

24

pointed out at the time, as we point out in our brief,

25

while that statute on its face looked gender neutral, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

fact, it would have operated in exactly the same way as

2

the statute that Congress enacted operated, because --

3

and no one has really taken serious issue with the

4

proposition we have in our brief that at the moment of

5

birth, it was the overwhelming rule that the mother was

6

the only legally recognized parent.

7
8
9

So in that -- this -- it would have operated
in essentially the same way.
And let me -- let me come at this in a

10

slightly different direction.

11

parent, the -- the mother in -- in this case, she gets

12

to make all of the pertinent decisions about the child.

13

Where they will live, where they will be domiciled,

14

situations like that.

15

If, when you have one

When a father legitimates, he does not -- he

16

does not then acquire the right to make -- the sole

17

right to make all the decisions for the child.

18

are then two parents.

19

There

He gets to --

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a lot of

20

complicated things, but the question I think is, think

21

of the child.

22

if his mother was an American, he becomes an American if

23

she's lived here for one year.

24

an American, she becomes an American only if he's lived

25

here for like eight years or ten years.

The child is born out of wedlock.

Now,

If it's his father who's

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, that's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

difference, and why does that make a difference?

2

justifies the gender discrimination?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Two -- two wrongs don't

make a right.

7
8

But that's the same rule that

applies if the parents are married, which is --

5
6

What

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but -- I don't think

it -- no one is challenging --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Perhaps.

Yeah, yeah, I

10

accept that no one is challenging, but I'm not asking

11

that question.

12

I'm asking the question of what it is -- I

13

would repeat the question, which you heard, which I

14

think is the equal protection question at the heart of

15

the case.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -And the answer that you

18

give in your brief was some endlessly -- I mean, it was

19

very well-written and brilliant --

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and -- and -- but it

22

went into this thing about statelessness persons, and --

23

and then we have, like, 17 briefs that say, no, no, that

24

wasn't what the situation was with statelessness

25

persons.

And so I guess the question would be there:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

Was it enough of a statelessness person justification to

2

warrant this gender discrimination?

3

There is no point in you repeating that.

4

think I've taken in that argument.

5

my mind about it.

6

Is there anything else?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'll have to make up

Well, the -- the first

8

argument we're making, again, is -- is the point of

9

connection to the United States, and that's where the

10

married couple comes in.

11

the proposition that Congress can impose a residency

12

requirement.

13
requirement.

15

mind when they read it.

16

Because no one is challenging

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

I

Wrong -- wrong residency

I did have Justice Kagan's question in

Why don't they ask the child if it would

17

like, when it reaches the age of 21, to be connected to

18

the United States and see if the child votes in American

19

elections and lives there a while?

20

worried about the child's parents?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Why are they so

Well -I mean, in any case, you

don't have to answer that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, no.

The Act provides for

the acquisition of citizenship at a date after birth,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15

and then --

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:
so forth.

Lived here for 14 years and

All kinds of stuff.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But --

No.
I don't want to argue with

6

you on this point.

I want to know if I've got the

7

reason for saying the mother, if she's the U.S. citizen

8

and he is born out of wedlock, he only lived here for a

9

year, but the father has to live here for, like, ten

10

years or eight years or something like that, the real

11

justification for that you've been able to find and the

12

only one you've been able to find has to do with this

13

thing about statelessness?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

We have two -- we have

two reasons.

16

United States, which is evident on the face of -- of the

17

statute.

18

statute does is treat the couple as if they were

20

legitimated by marriage, and what the statute basically

21

did was make the marriage retroactive to the date of

22

birth.

23
24
25

The first one is the connection to the

When the father legitimates, what -- what the

In fact, in this case, the child was

I'm going to make an

example where they never married.

They -- they like living

2

together without being married.

3

justification?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Now what's the

Well, under the 1986

5

amendments, it's -- it is easier for the father to

6

acknowledge the child.

7

there are two -- there are two parents.

8

situation, the father does not get to make unilateral

9

decisions about the child.

But in that situation, again,
And in that

He gets to be a parent too.

10

He doesn't get to be the only parent the way the mother

11

is the only parent before legitimation.

12

And this is true in Lehr v. Robertson and --

13

and the cases this Court has had in -- in the domestic

14

context.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, you're --

16

you are giving a sophisticated rationale, but we're

17

talking about legislation from 1940 and 1952.

18

At that time, the statute books were just

19

shot through with distinctions between children born out

20

of wedlock and affiliation with the mother and the

21

father.

22

And it wasn't until when Ms. Trimble again scored a

23

typical.

24

born out of wedlock can inherent to an intestate

25

succession from the mother only, not the father.

So this was a piece with all that legislation.

And the Illinois Probate Code said a child

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

laws just put mothers and children not born of the

2

marriage together and separated fathers from their

3

children.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And nobody thought until

6

the 1970s that that was a violation of equal protection.

7

But in a whole series of cases in the '70s, the Court

8

recognized that, indeed, there was a violation of equal

9

protection.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, insofar as -- I mean,

11

there are two equal protection arguments that have been

12

made in cases like that.

13

equal protection on the basis of illegitimacy.

14

that claim is not raised here with good reason, because

15

the -- because Respondent, as -- as an alien outside the

16

United -- person outside the United States and an alien

17

by statute, did not have constitutional rights.

18

the --

19

One of them has to do with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That --

So it's

My point was that the

20

laws that existed put mothers and children born out of

21

wedlock together and separated fathers from their

22

children --

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Right.
-- out of what the

reality of their life was.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

MR. KNEEDLER:

And in this Court's decision

2

in Fiallo in the immigration context, that was exactly

3

the situation, and the Court rejected equal protection

4

claims based both on -- on sex discrimination and on

5

illegitimacy.

6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
citizenship.

8
9

That was not a claim of

MR. KNEEDLER:

It wasn't, but we -- but we

think -- we think, if anything, it follows Ofar Sharar,

10

because citizenship is -- is entering into the citizenry

11

or the membership of our society on a permanent basis

12

with rights to come and go with all the rights and

13

obligations.

But I -- but I also wanted to address

15

your -- your question with respect to the domestic

16

context.

17

sustained a situation where you -- where a child was

18

going to be put up for adoption.

19

ordinarily have the sole right to decide that, but the

20

situation was, what -- what about the father?

21

father had to take some affirmative steps to put himself

22

in a position where he could have a role, essentially a

23

veto power over --

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, they did.

But, again,

2

at that point, he is -- he is not similarly situated to

3

the mother, either at the time of birth or at the time

4

he legitimates.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you

6

this question:

7

violates the Equal Protection Clause, does it

8

necessarily follow that the Petitioner is entitled to

9

the relief that was awarded to him by the Second

10

Circuit; in other words, the granting of citizenship?

11
12

If the Court thinks that this statute

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it by no means follows.

And I --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, could you address

14

that?

We -- we had a similar issue a few terms ago in

15

down.

Wouldn't you agree?

That's been the Court's consistent practice.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

yes.

But that -- that -- the Court has made clear that

that is not constitutionally compelled.

7

there are compelling reasons here not to do that.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And there --

Well, I find one compelling

reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up

10

to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this

11

case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice

12

between leveling up and leveling down in one sense,

13

because if you level down, this party gets no relief.

14

In other words, you say, well, you level --

15

you just apply it prospectively.

But then this party

16

gets absolutely no relief.

Isn't it the kind of the same problem as Justice Harlan

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

In this context in particular, there are

25

Well, several things.

serious questions about whether the Court can, but, at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the very least, substantial reasons why the Court should

are situations in which the Court has found a

constitutional violation but not granted relief.

And -- and --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But not really a situation

like this.

Not a situation where we say, uh, there is

an equal protection violation, and if we extend the

8

benefit to everybody, we can take care of that equal

9

protection violation, we can remedy the problem.

But if

10

we do not, if we try to level down, the effect of that

11

is that the -- the party before us who has proved an

12

equal protection violation gets absolutely no relief at

all.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I would like to answer

15

that quickly and then reserve the balance of my time

of -- of -- for rebuttal.

17

I think it's also relevant, in taking into

account the remedy, that this is not Respondent's own

constitutional right.

20

There's no automatic right to raise the rights of third

parties; in this case, the father.

dispute centers on a -- on a right of Respondent's

father to be treated equally to transmit his citizenship

13

on the same terms that a mother could transmit

citizenship under Section 1409.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

On this, but -- I would say

16

at some point, the problem that worries me the most is,

17

assuming this is unconstitutional, do you put the 14

18

years or whatever it is, ten years, on both, or the one

19

year on both?

20

And I -- I want to -- because he does have a

21

point.

You put the one year on both and then you have,

22

when the parents are married, it's the ten years, and

23

when it's the -- they're not married, it's the one year,

24

and that really doesn't make much sense.

25

the -- so I'm -- I'm -- hope you'll get to that.

Alderson Reporting Company

But the --

And in the course of that, I read an amicus

brief that bothered me a lot, and it said, actually, the

it.

if that's really true.

And the reason it's

How they do this, I don't know, and I want to know

don't qualify.

MR. BROOME:

Justice Breyer, let me address

the last question first.
The word "continuous," I do not think,

would -- is going to -- as a practical matter, it can't

22

be applied in a way that somebody would have to come

23

forward and prove that they were in the United States

JUSTICE BREYER:

that question.

4

Solicitor General has time, he could simply confirm that

5

answer by saying yes.

6

8

That is your answer.

So I -- I --

MR. BROOME:

And maybe, if the

Well, let me tell you how it

was -- how it was applied in this case.
So this case, when we were in the court of

9

appeals, the court was -- th court remanded the case to

10

the Western District of New York for a determination on

11

that very question.

12

Whether or not -- if -- if the -- in order

13

to decide whether the court should address the

14

constitutional issue, the court first asked whether

15

Respondent's father would have satisfied the one

16

continuous year rule.

17

So we went to the Western District of

18

New York, and we were not -- the government ultimately

19

stipulated that, yes, because we have evidence of

20

Respondent's father being in the United States, or in

21

this case an outlying possession, from his birth in 1900

22

until the date of his departure for the Dominican

23

Republic in 1919, we will -- we will presume that there

24

was at least some period in there where he was in the

25

United States for one continuous year.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I think that

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

that presumption would apply in most cases.

2

certainly was applied in this case that we would not

3

have to come forward and show proof on -- that he was in

4

the United States on every single day.

5

It

But I think if the Court were troubled that

6

perhaps that -- that rule could be harder for some

7

fathers or some -- or people to follow, but an

8

alternative remedy could be to leave both options on the

9

table.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we leveled down and

11

made it harder, would that affect the status of people

12

who have obtained citizenship under the more lenient

13

provision applicable to the mother?

14

MR. BROOME:

Justice Kennedy, if this Court

15

applied the leveling down remedy in a way that -- in a

16

way that would actually equalize the -- the two

17

similarly-situated classes here, it would have to --

18

yes, it would impact people dramatically because it

19

would take citizenship away from people who already have

20

it.

21

And the Court has held --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's not

23

necessary -- I assume it could be prospective because

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the argument

18

that in most of the cases where a benefit was extended,

19

the -- the group that -- to which the benefit was

20

extended was a smaller group than the group that already

21

got the benefit, and here, if you add in married

parents, then most people are under the more difficult

rule, ten years or whatever it is, and it's the smaller

group that gets the benefit.

Ginsburg, would not affect marital couples, and the

intent, what we've seen from the historical record,

from their guardian parents.

The problem is that Congress assumed or

10

drafted the statute assumed that the -- the guardian

11

parent was always going to be the mother.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, you can conceive

13

the -- the possibility of members of Congress in 1940 or

14

1952 taking the floor and arguing, you know, we need to

15

discriminate against the children of married parents,

16

and in favor of the children of unmarried parents.

MR. BROOME:

No, I -- I don't think that's

20

were -- the one thing I think is they were giving a

21

benefit to the unmarried mother.

22
23

MR. BROOME:

That's correct,

Justice Ginsburg, and the --

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because they thought she

25

was different from the unmarried father.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BROOME:

They -- they presumed that she

2

would be -- that's a reflexive assumption that the

3

mother -- at that time, it was a reflexive assumption --

4

I don't think it's as true today -- but that the mother

5

was going to be the guardian parent, and they wanted to

6

make sure that -- that the physical presence

7

requirements that -- that Congress was passing were not

8

going to have the impact of separating that nonmarital

9

child from who they presumed to be the parent.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose there

11

were some statistics that would indicate that over

12

100,000 new citizens would qualify or new persons

13

would -- would qualify for citizenship if -- if we

14

adopted leveling up.

15

that affect our decision?

16

MR. BROOME:

I don't think it -- I don't

think it should, because at the end of the -- at the --

Would that affect our -- should

And outside would gain

Ultimately, I think the Court

has to decide whether or not there is an equal

22

protection violation here, whether or not --

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Don't we have to consider

what the Congress likely would have intended?
MR. BROOME:

Yes, and -- and I think what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

the record shows is that given Congress' purpose here --

2

in fact, if you take either the purpose that -- that we

3

have argued was the purpose of Section 1409, and the

4

purpose that the government has argued, the

5

statelessness purpose, both of those purposes are served

6

by the remedy we -- we propose, by extending the

7

benefits to unmarried -- unmarried fathers.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kneedler --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

If we

10

leveled up, how would that affect children who were born

11

to an -- to a citizen father, who were previously denied

12

citizenship, could they come in and claim citizenship

13

now?

14
15

MR. BROOME:

all -- all -- all the other statutory requirements.

16
17
18
19

If -- only if they satisfied

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The answer

is yes?
MR. BROOME:

Yes, yes, if they satisfied the

other statutory requirements.

21

MR. BROOME:

22

Which means?

The continuous one year.

And the legitimation

requirements.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

MR. BROOME:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the legitimacy.

Yes.
More than that, I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

it would be -- at first the father would have had to

2

have sired this child abroad, would have had to

3

recognized the child, would have had to support the

4

child.

5

MR. BROOME:

That's correct, yes.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. BROOME:

So I don't think that --

We're talking about a fairly

8

limited class, I think here, Justice Ginsburg, and I --

9

I would like to turn to the government's arguments about

10
11

the U.S.-connection interest.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But before you -- before you

12

do that, Mr. Broome, just on the remedy question, very

13

occasionally this Court has faced a situation when the

14

natural remedy of something that it is holding.

15

concerned a little bit about how -- whether Congress

16

would prefer a different remedy.

17

We were

So, for example, in the Northern Pipeline

18

case, what we did in a situation like that was we stayed

19

our judgment for a period of time and allowed Congress

20

essentially to do it a different way if it wanted to.

21

And I'm wondering whether you had considered that

22

possibility here, that we could order a kind of

23

leveling-up judgment but stay it for some period of time

24

so that Congress could decide whether it instead

25

preferred some other way of dealing with the problem,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

whether that would be appropriate?

2

MR. BROOME:

I -- I think, Justice Kagan,

3

first and foremost, the Court needs to remedy the equal

4

protection violation suffered by the parties.

5

if that -- if the Court were to level up and make

6

Respondent -- Respondent a citizen, and then stay the

7

judgment thereafter, I -- you know, I think potentially

8

that could work, but certainly --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What relief -- the relief

10

would have been granted to this person.

11

some kind of class action.

12

MR. BROOME:

So if --

Right.

This is not

Ultimately, the Court

13

has to decide -- has to remedy the equal protection

14

violation before it and -- and not be thinking about --

15

well, it is not trying to remedy an equal protection

16

violation only in the future.

17

fundamental problem with the government's remedy is that

18

it could only apply to unborn children and future

19

parents, and it would have no impact on anybody who is

20

affected by the statute at issue before the Court today.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think that the

Justice Kagan's

22

suggestion, Congress apparently should -- should have

23

been aware of this after our Flores-Villar, but they

24

were soporific.

25

(Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BROOME:

But what we have seen, Justice

2

Kennedy is that since the date that this discriminatory

3

provision was first enacted in 1940, it has

4

consistently -- Congress has consistently reduced the

5

burden on -- on fathers.

6

question is, what would Congress do today, well,

7

Congress has shown that it is continually reducing the

8

physical presence requirements and the age calibration

9

component of it to -- so that it has -- precludes the

10
11

So I think if -- if the

transfer of citizenship -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I mean,

12

that argument seems to me that, in other words, they

13

have considered the issue several times, and at no point

14

did they take the step of eliminating it.

15

MR. BROOME:

That's -- that's correct,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, but they also haven't been confronted

17

with a -- the last time that Congress considered the

18

statute was in 1986, and it -- and it -- an equal

protection challenge to these physical presence

requirements was not -- was not made until the

Flores-Villar case.

And that was --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why -- why did you

use the word "today"?

I thought what we were supposed

to do is go back and figure out if they had known that

25

it was unconstitutional to give the unmarried woman a

43

year requirement to live in the United States, but to

give the unmarried man where he is a citizen eight

unconstitutional then, what would they have done then?

Is it then or is it now?

Congress would pass the -- if the question is how did

the Congress that passed this statute, how would they

THE COURT:

4

MR. BROOME:

Not how they would remedy -Sorry.

How -- how would they

5

remedy that -- that -- that statute if that --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What would their

7

understanding have been about the appropriate remedy

8

when they passed the statute?

9

MR. BROOME:

I -- I think -- I think the

10

answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that they --

11

they -- they were -- they were -- were concerned that

12

the physical presence requirements would create a

13

significant burden on -- on marital children, and that

14

is why they lowered the requirements for the mother,

15

because they presumed the mother was going to be the

16

guardian and that -- and they -- and they presumed that

17

the child should stay with mother.

18

the physical presence requirements to create further

19

burden on that child -- that -- that relationship.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And they didn't want

What the Court -- the

21

Congress in '40 or '52 would do is strange in this

22

context, because the Court -- the Congress sitting then

23

took gender-based lines for granted.

25

MR. BROOME:

That's right.

And I think that

the -- if I could just sort of finish the Chief

Alderson Reporting Company

45

Justice's question, the -- it is not clear at all that

2

that -- that the 1940 Congress would have chosen to just

3

sever the 1409(c) entirely.

4

just as destructive of Congress' intent to withdraw a

5

benefit that Congress plainly intended to confer than it

6

would be to extend the benefit that perhaps Congress did

7

not --

8

And I think it would be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So do -- do I

understand you to agree that when we approach these

10

questions, severance and remedy, that we do look at what

11

the Congress at the time when they passed the law would

12

have done?

13

MR. BROOME:

I'm not sure if there is a

14

clear answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

the Court could look at what Congress would do today and

what Congress has done in the decades since.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. BROOME:

It is difficult, and -- and --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then don't

4

pretend that you're implementing Congress' intent when

5

you say we're going to -- we're going to put in place

6

when we're talking about a remedy, not in terms of

finding a violation.

8

implementing Congress' intent when you look at what

9

Congress -- a Congress 60 years later would do.

10

Don't pretend that you're

MR. BROOME:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, when

you are remedying a gender-discriminatory statute by

leveling up or leveling down, you are never implementing

ask, what would they have wanted if they knew they

thought, well, if you have to go back to '52, they're

going to either have to take the benefit away from the

they give anybody.

they take benefits away.

That's why I

So that would move them in

And it would also move them in the same

Alderson Reporting Company

direction if there are just a handful of them who might

2

really benefit.

3

nobody -- but if there were millions of men who might

4

benefit, then they might get a little worried about what

5

they're doing, particularly since they're discriminating

6

even more, you know, the other way against the married

7

couple.

8
9
10
11
12
13

That's why I asked that question.

But

So that's why I was interested in those
questions.

But I take it you have said pretty much what

you can say on that.
MR. BROOME:

As to Congress' intent, yes,

Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As to the number --

14

number of people, all you can say is they would have to

15

meet a lot of requirements that you would have -- the

16

U.S. citizen sired a child abroad, recognize that child,

17

supported that child, and --

18

MR. BROOME:

Right.

You're -- we are

19

talking about, I think, a fairly limited class.

20

are -- this is just children who were born outside of

21

the United States to unmarried United States-citizen

22

fathers who cannot satisfy the ten-year requirement, but

23

they can satisfy the one-year requirement, so they're

24

somewhere in that nine-year period.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

These

I think that --

Perhaps you're assuming

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

Justice Ginsburg's point that the father still has to

2

have legitimatized the child without marriage.

3

if they married the mother, they would end up having to

4

fulfill the five-year.

5

you accepting her proposition that the father has to

6

legitimatize the child?

7

MR. BROOME:

8

Because

So it would have to be -- are

We're not -- we're certainly

not challenging the legitimation requirement.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that -- that's

10

statutory and also the support requirement.

11

may be independently challengeable, but they are --

12

MR. BROOME:

Now, they

And I think in this case they

13

could be, because this is -- this is a different

14

requirement than -- than what was at issue in the Nguyen

15

case.

acknowledgement requirement and said, well, that is a

17

minimal burden for the five-year satisfied.

18

he is not similarly situated as -- with respect to

19

biological proof of his relationship with the child.

20

But the requirement that he then come forward and take

21

some affirmative step to demonstrate that by

22

acknowledging the child, that -- that is -- that

23

satisfies intermediate scrutiny.

In Nguyen, the Court addressed a paternal

24
25

He can --

But here we're talking about a legitimation
requirement.

And if, as the Historians have pointed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

out -- the -- the Historian amicus brief points out,

2

that legitimation really meant marriage, then that is a

3

much more significant burden placed on the father

4

because the father may not be able to -- may not be able

5

to satisfy that requirement at all.

6

mother is not around -- is not available, if she doesn't

7

want to marry the father, or if she is dead.

Or if she is already

married.

requirement?

13

word about legitimation.

Or if she is already married.

MR. BROOME:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:
apply.

Where is the legitimation

I see 8 U.S.C. 1409(c).

14

16

For example, if the

It doesn't say a

It's in 1409(a).
Well, 1409(a) doesn't

It says "notwithstanding subsection A."

17

MR. BROOME:

Right.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so the --

It says:

"Notwithstanding

19

subsection (a), somebody who is born outside the U.S.

20

out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth

21

the nationality status of his mother if the mother is a

22

U.S. citizen and had been physically in the United

23

States for one year."

24
25

So I don't see anything that says they have
to be legitimized for the mother to get that.

MR. BROOME:

In 1409(a), it applies only

first words of (c) are, "notwithstanding the provision

MR. BROOME:

10

Let me see if I can try and

help you, Justice Breyer.
The remedy imposed by the Court of Appeals

12

is to -- as 1401(a)(7), which the -- the

13

physical-presence requirement, the ten- and five-year

you this is complicated -- 1401(a)(7) as it -- as it

20

applies through 1409(a).

21

fathers on equal footing with respect to the

22

physical-presence requirements.

23

legitimation requirement still applies to fathers.

24
25

And that would put mothers and

And then the

But if I could address the -- the
government's U.S.-connection interest in my time

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

remaining.

2

The statute here absolutely bars a

3

U.S.-citizen father under the age of 19 from

4

transmitting citizenship to his foreign-born child, even

5

if the father spent his entire life in the United States

6

up until the day the child is born, and even if the

7

father legitimates the child and seeks to raise the

8

child in the United States.

9

By contrast, the statute automatically

10

confers citizenship on a child whose U.S.-citizen mother

11

spent only a year of her life at any point in her

12

time -- any point in her life, even during infancy, and

13

even if the -- even if the mother marries the alien

14

father, and then -- and then the child is raised by the

15

mother and the alien father.

16

It is impossible to view a statute that

17

permits these results as related to a U.S.-connection

18

interest.

19

statelessness interest does not justify the

20

discrimination either.

21

And I would submit, Your Honor, that the

There is no dispute here that the statute

22

creates a risk of statelessness for children born abroad

23

to unmarried United States-citizen fathers who

24

legitimate their children but who cannot satisfy the

25

ten -- ten- and five-year physical-presence requirement.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the statute -- the -- the statute confers

2

citizenship on a child born abroad to an unmarried

3

United States-citizen mother, even if that child

4

faces -- even if her child faces no risk of

5

statelessness at all because she is born -- the child is

6

born in a country that assigns citizenship by virtue of

7

being born there.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we aren't leaving

children uncovered whose mothers have not had a

10

continuous one-year residency in the United States, even

11

though that mother may be an American citizen.

12

MR. BROOME:

That's -- that's right.

My

13

point is that her child may have no risk -- face no

14

risk -- risk of statelessness at all, and -- and yet,

15

the statute still confers citizenship --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I just said they do.

17

Because the mother can only pass on citizenship if she's

18

been in the United States continuously for one year

19

prior to the birth of the child, correct?

20

MR. BROOME:

That's correct.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what happens to a

22

citizen mother who can't meet that one-year requirement?

MR. BROOME:

There is a risk of

statelessness, but that risk of statelessness is created

5

by these physical-presence requirements that Congress

6

chose to impose, whether it's the mother or the father.

The risk is greater with respect to the fathers.

lesser with respect to the mothers.

not divesting that child of citizenship if the child is

5

later legitimated by an alien father.

substantial interests that are furthered, and it is

7

precisely tailored to take care of those two interests.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So there are two

9

about the stateless children in the world, then -- if --

10

if you have a problem with the father who can't transmit

11

his citizenship in a country where women citizenship

12

goes by who is the father.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- it -- if the --

14

if the father later legitimates, he's put in the same

15

position as if the -- if they were married at the time

16

the child was born.

I don't say they do it perfectly, but they

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but all -Now, suppose just the words

24

you said, take the same words, just put in "father"

instead of "mother," and today why is it any different?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, certainly -So that's one focus.

And

11

certainly your words applied where it is the mother.

12

And all my question is, couldn't you take those same

13

words and apply it where it is the father?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I -- I think it's a

15

critical importance in citizenship laws to have a legal

16

occurrence in order to pass citizenship, and that's

17

legitimation.

18

the father could pass on citizenship without even

legitimation, which this Court basically sustained on

With respect to remedy, let me point out at
page 38 of our brief where the statelessness is

addressed.

It's clear the interests that I identify,

that Congress wanted to ensure that the child would have

citizenship at birth and not be divested.
