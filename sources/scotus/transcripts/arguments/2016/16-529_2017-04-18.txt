CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Unikowsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM UNIKOWSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The government contends it can bring

12

sovereign enforcement actions seeking backwards-looking

13

monetary liability based on conduct dating back forever

14

with no statute of limitations at all.

15

both contradicts the text of Section 2462 and is

16

antithetical to legal traditions dating back to the

17

early Republic.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That position

I guess your

19

phraseology is technically correct, but the government

20

says there's a multifactor analysis that a court would

21

go through to determine that maybe the government's

22

brought its action too late.

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, I -- actually,

24

the government doesn't really take that position because

25

it contends that laches does not apply to the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

at all.

2

restriction -- or at least the government has taken that

3

position in every court, and certainly does not

4

contradict that position in its brief.

So the government's supposed equitable

5

So the government's view is that there's

6

some kind of equitable limitation that only applies at

7

the remedial stage after the trial and the remedial

8

stage is already over.

9

trial after, you know, 10, 20, 30 years after the

10

incident.

11

restriction.

12

So the person's already stood

And even then, it's a pretty weak equitable

I think the recent Wiley case kind of

13

illustrates this restriction in action where the

14

government sought 22 years of prejudgment interest at a

15

very high interest rate.

16

excuse me -- the district court said that because the

17

SEC was partially responsible for the delay, it was

18

going to apply a somewhat lower prejudgment interest

19

rate that lowered the amount of prejudgment interest

20

from 200 to $100 million, and that is not really an

21

adequate substitute for a statute of limitations in our

22

view.

23

And the government -- and --

So we think that a statute of limitations is

24

necessary for actions to be dismissed pretrial.

25

think that also our position falls within the heartland

Alderson Reporting Company

And we

Official - Subject to Final Review

of the word "forfeiture."

2

ordinary definition of forfeiture, which has not changed

3

between the 19th century and today.

4

requiring turnover of money or property to the

5

government as a result of wrongdoing.

We ask the Court to apply the

6

Edwards --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's an order

Counselor, before the

8

1970s -- and you haven't shown me anything to the

9

contrary -- forfeiture was an in rem proceeding where

10

the property was attached; the money, the bank account,

11

a piece of property, a home, whatever, but it was not a

12

personal action against an individual.

13

from that traditional understanding which governed this

14

statute to your meaning today?

15

difference between in rem and in personam actions.

16

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So how do we get

Because there is a vast

Well, I'd give two responses

17

to that.

18

premise that there was no concept of in personam

19

forfeitures before 1970.

20

instance, as the government itself says in its brief, an

21

in personam money judgment in the form of a fine was

22

considered a forfeiture.

23
24
25

First of all, I would -- I would dispute a

I think that there was.

For

And so the government has this odd position
where -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A fine has -- I mean,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

forfeit -- disgorgement is an equitable remedy on

2

getting back money that doesn't belong to you.

3

is a payment in addition to the conduct that you

4

committed.

A fine

So there is a difference there.

5

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Right.

I --

That begs the question.

Well, I agree with you,

8

Justice Sotomayor.

9

that the government says that the word "forfeiture"

10

encompasses these in personam money fines, and also

11

encompasses these in rem turnovers of tainted property,

12

and disgorgement is kind of right in between those two

13

forfeitures the government recognizes.

14

The position I'm trying to say is

So like a fine, it's an in personam payment

15

of money, and like an in rem forfeiture, it's a turnover

16

order of tainted property to the government.

17

it's somewhat gerrymandered, in our view, that kind of

18

one and three would be forfeiture, but not two.

19

And so

And the other thing is I would -- you know,

20

historically, I actually think that there were in

21

personam forfeitures of the value of money.

22

the example of this old customs fine -- forfeitures,

23

excuse me -- which are actually quite similar to today's

24

disgorgement.

25

to pay, not necessarily just the property that was

So we give

If you violated the customs laws, you had

2

historically called forfeitures as well.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And those were

Mr. Unikowsky, whatever

4

the history, certainly disgorgement was not in the days

5

of the common law what it is today.

6

been asking for this kind of relief now for, what, over

7

30 years?

8
9
10
11

Yet the SEC has

Has there been any effort, any activity in
Congress to make this clear, one way or another, whether
disgorgement fits with forfeiture?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, there hasn't, because

12

really, the SEC's efforts to seek these -- what we view

13

as stale disgorgements are quite new.

14

So, for instance, the government says that

15

in 1990, Congress implicitly ratified its position about

16

the statute of limitations.

17

could not find a single case, ever, before 1990, in

18

which the government had sought these forfeitures from

19

beyond 5 years.

20

We boiled the oceans and

None.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it clear that the

21

district court has statutory authority to do this?

22

I understand that in cases where the aggrieved party is

23

before the court, there can be equitable remedies under

24

State law and so forth to afford restitution, at least.

25

Is -- is there specific statutory authority

Alderson Reporting Company

I --

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

that makes it clear that the district court can

2

entertain this remedy?

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

There's no specific

4

statutory authority.

5

capacity of the district court to seek disgorgement;

6

we've just said that there's a time limitation.

7

disgorgement began in the 1970s, the SEC was seeking

8

that as an implied remedy.

9

the SEC can seek disgorgement.

10

So we've never challenged the

When

There's no statute that says
There may be -- sorry.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have any idea

11

what percentage of time -- how often a district court

12

does direct that the disgorgement go to a victim as

13

opposed to the government?

14

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

There -- one of the amicus

15

briefs, the American Investment Council, quotes

16

numbers -- and I haven't personally checked their

17

accuracy -- of something like $800 million out of

18

6 billion.

19

by statute, penalties also have to go to victims.

20

Again, I haven't personally verified the accuracy of

21

those numbers.

22

The 6 billion includes penalties, although

But I think it's quite pertinent, actually,

23

that the biggest money disgorgements tend to be in these

24

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases where the government

25

gets often multi-hundred millions of dollars'

And those aren't compensatory at

Those -- those moneys are just deposited in the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can we go back to the

6

authority?

7

imagine, says, "A court may grant any equitable relief

8

that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of

9

investors."

78u, which is the only authority I can

If they are not doing -- if they're not

10

doing restitution, how could that be the basis of

11

disgorgement?

12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So that statute was enacted

13

30 years after the SEC already started seeking

14

disgorgement.

15

the -- the fountain of its judicial authority to do it,

16

given that it had been doing it for so long before that.

17

I think some of the --

18

So the SEC, I don't think, views that as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I'll let your

19

adversary tell me what the source of their power is, but

20

I -- I -- it is unusual.

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- we do argue at some

22

length in our brief that it doesn't genuinely count as

23

an equitable form of relief.

24

government really doesn't --

25

And it's notable that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you tell me why

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

you think this is punitive?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.
What are your best

4

arguments?

5

responded to some of them in -- in, well, somewhat

6

persuasive ways.

7

strongest argument as to why it's punitive and not

8

restorative?

9

I've read your brief, but the government

So what do you think remains as your

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, Your Honor, first of

10

all, I think the legal standard is that if it has

11

components of both a penal and remedial remedy, it's

12

considered penal.

13

some penal component.

14

because when one defines the purpose of the disgorgement

15

remedy, it's to -- it's to create -- it's to ensure that

16

someone doesn't benefit from wrongdoing.

17

say that, you are talking about wrongdoing; in other

18

words, the -- the purpose of the remedy is to impose

19

unpleasant legal consequences of wrongdoing.

20

So the question is whether it has
I think that the answer is yes,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But when you

But that's every --

21

restitution is that way, and you don't think of

22

restitution as punitive.

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I agree, Your Honor.

But I

24

think in restitution, you can define a purpose

25

independent of the person's wrongdoing, which is to say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

that there's a victim and we want to compensate that

2

victim.

3

that's independent of redressing the wrongdoing of the

4

individual.

5

So you can define a purpose of that remedy

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a question I'm

6

going to ask your adversary, but what do you see as the

7

difference between -- besides the statute of

8

limitations, what's the difference between restitution

9

and disgorgement?

10

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that

11

restitution historically was a judgment requiring money

12

to go to the victim.

13

case called Porter, which we talk about, in which the

14

district court actually orders a landlord who charged

15

illegally high rents to pay money to the tenants.

16

was the judgment.

17

this noncompensatory remedy that goes straight to the

18

government, and the government has the discretion to put

19

it in the treasury or not, wherever -- however it

20

chooses.

21

gives -- excuse me -- the wrongdoer gives money to the

22

victim.

23

So, for instance, there's this old

That

It wasn't like disgorgement, which is

Restitution was a remedy in which the victim

So -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if we had that, if we

24

had this working only when the money goes to the victim,

25

the government doesn't get it, would your -- then your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

statute of limitations argument fail if this is just a

2

remedy for victims?

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I would probably be making a

4

different argument in that case.

5

the private statute of limitations applies.

6

some old cases from the 19th century that hold that if

7

the government is just bringing an action standing in

8

the shoes of a private plaintiff, then private statutes

9

of limitations are applicable.

10
11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'd be arguing that
There's

And, actually, in the --

What is the private statute

of limitations?

12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- I think it would be the

13

two years and then five-year statute of repose, but

14

I'm -- I'm not certain of that, but I think that that's

15

probably what it would be.

16

that several years ago in the '90s, a litigant made that

17

argument.

And it's a case called Rind from the Ninth

18

Circuit.

And the SEC successfully persuaded the Ninth

19

Circuit that really didn't -- disgorgement was not a

20

compensatory remedy.

21
22

25

It wasn't about compensation.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the name of that

case?

23
24

But it's interesting to note

MR. UNIKOWSKY:
Circuit.

Rind.

It's from the Ninth

We cite it in the reply brief.
And so the government is trying to sort of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

have it both ways.

2

compensatory, the Commission says it isn't.

3

are arguing that it isn't, which we argue here, which is

4

consistent with many briefs the SEC has cited from

5

the -- has filed in lower courts, the SEC is saying that

6

it is.

7

twilight zone of sometimes compensatory, sometimes not,

8

and trying to avoid statutes of limitations applicable

9

to both types of remedies.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

When people are arguing that it's
When people

It's sort of defining disgorgement in this

Well, this case puts us in a

11

rather strange position, because we have to decide

12

whether this is a penalty or a forfeiture.

13

to decide whether this thing is a penalty or a

14

forfeiture, we need to understand what this thing is.

15

And in order to understand what it is, it would

16

certainly be helpful and maybe essential to know what

17

the authority for it is.

18

But in order

So how do we get out of that -- out of that

19

situation?

20

a forfeiture without fully understanding what this form

21

of this remedy or this, whatever it is, where it comes

22

from and -- and its exact nature?

23

How do we decide whether it is a penalty or

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think that -- I agree the

24

Court has to decide that question.

25

advocate is just look at disgorgement as it's actually

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, what we

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

being applied in the real world in the lower courts.

2

And so, for instance, we give a bunch of

3

examples where the Commission is seeking disgorgements

4

going beyond restoring the person to the status quo

5

ante.

6

disgorge money that went to everyone, not just you.

7

in tipper or tippee situations, in insider trading

8

cases, the tipper has to disgorge all the money that

9

went to the tippee.

10

So the SEC's position is that you've got to
So

And so I -- I mean, I don't think

the Court --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't know why

12

that proves anything.

13

proceeds and give half of it to Justice Breyer --

If I commit a crime and take my

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know what I was

16

buying, but I bought something.

I got the benefit just

17

because I was able to direct it.

So I don't know that

18

that moves me.

19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, but that -- what --

20

the example I gave is beyond cases where you just direct

21

the money.

22

a tippee and never has control over any of the money at

23

all, and the tippee trades on it and gets some money,

24

the tipper has to disgorge money, which he never even

25

controlled.

It's just a tipper who gives information to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

And so I -- and to answer Justice Alito's

2

question, I think that it's true that there's some

3

dispute about what disgorgement is, where it comes from.

4

We argue it's not genuinely equitable, and the

5

government doesn't really defend its equitable nature.

6

I think the Court should take disgorgement as it finds

7

it right now in the lower courts.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

as we find it in this particular case?

Well, why don't we take it
So is there any

10

difficulty in identifying the victims in this particular

11

case and ensuring that the money that was

12

misappropriated from them by your client goes to them

13

and not into the government's coffers?

14

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I believe on the -- on

15

the facts of this case, the disgorgement is a penalty as

16

well as a forfeiture.

17

true that -- I -- I actually don't know if the victims

18

are readily identifiable.

19

we don't think it really matters ultimately, because

20

this remedy is a remedy that ultimately goes to the

21

government in the first instance, which it can direct it

22

however it wants to.

23

the victims at all.

24
25

And the reason why is that it's

But whether they are or not,

It's not a judgment in favor of
And so --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, again, we don't know.

How do we know that the government has the authority to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

direct it wherever it wants?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

That's the authority the

3

government's been asserting for several decades that the

4

lower courts have been asserting.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

I thought -- I thought

6

the government's position was that they must give it to

7

the victim, if feasible.

8

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

possible to find the victims.

11

thought the government's position was no, this is not

12

just simply our discretion on whom we will shed our

13

grace; but if it's feasible, it goes to the victim.

14

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well -It may or may not be
They may be dead.

But I

That is absolutely not the

15

government's position.

16

consistently in numerous lower court briefs, is that it

17

has the discretion to decide or the district court has

18

the discretion to decide.

19

that this money be distributed.

20

taken the position, for instance, that because

21

disgorgement is not compensatory, victims don't even

22

have standing to challenge how the disgorgement is

23

distributed.

24

there is no legal requirement at all, as opposed to a

25

discretionary rule, to distribute the money.

The government's position,

There's no legal requirement
The government has

And it's also taken the position that

Alderson Reporting Company

And --

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, we'll ask the

3

government what their position is, whether it's totally

4

in their discretion whether they want to give this to

5

victims or keep it all.

6

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- I should add, there's

7

the -- there are certain Fair Fund rules that require,

8

not in -- it's not applicable to -- necessarily to this

9

case.

But there are certain rules that direct that

10

money be put in funds that ultimately can go to victims.

11

But we think this is all immaterial because,

12

first of all, the money in the first instance goes to

13

the government, just like civil penalties also in the

14

first instance go to the government and there's still

15

penalties.

16

And second of all, I just urge the Court to

17

read the government's many, many lower court briefs

18

where it takes the position over and over again for

19

litigation benefit that disgorgement is not a primarily

20

compensatory remedy.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The case is presented to

22

us as if disgorgement is this category we must adopt.

23

And correct me if it's mistaken, but it seems to me that

24

the parties seem to order -- argue a categorical rule.

25

It's always a penalty or it's always not a penalty.

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

seems to me that maybe we can give guidance as to when

2

it is a penalty and -- and if -- am I correct that

3

that's the way the case is presented to us, it's all or

4

nothing?

5

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah.

So I think that as a

6

matter of both doctrine and practicality, it should be

7

all or nothing.

8

the Court should look at the definition of disgorgement

9

rather than how it applies in a particular case.

First of all, doctrinally, I think that

10

And there are also practical problems.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

But it's not a statutory

term.

13

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, that is true, but I --

14

I think that there are problems within a particular

15

case, looking how monies are directed.

16

But I just want to step back and say that

17

our position is, even just looking at the facts of this

18

case, this disgorgement is both a forfeiture and a

19

penalty.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Because?
It's a forfeiture because

22

it's an order requiring Petitioner to turn over his

23

money as a result of wrongdoing.

24

natural to say, Petitioner was required to forfeit $34.9

25

million to the government because he did something

I think it's very

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19

wrong, as found by a jury.
In fact, forfeiture of proceeds of illegal

3

activity are -- those statutes, such as 29 U.S.C.

4

853(a)(1) are essentially identical to disgorgement.

5

The government's brief identifies no differences, no

6

material differences between those forfeiture of

7

proceeds statutes and disgorgement.

8

enacted those statutes, it called them forfeiture.

9

And when Congress

Now, it's true those statutes are pretty

10

new, but the reason Congress uses the word "forfeiture"

11

is that it falls within the definition of a forfeiture.

12

So I give an example of an injunction.

So

13

school desegregation or prison de-crowding orders, those

14

are injunctions.

15

exist in 1830, but they're still injunctions.

16

the same way, these forfeitures of proceeds, which are

17

identical in every way to disgorgement, as far as we can

18

tell, were called forfeitures.

19

They're new injunctions, they didn't
And in

So even just focusing on the facts of my

20

client's case, ignoring all those other cases from the

21

Second Circuit, the remedy against the Petitioner was

22

essentially identical to the forfeiture of proceeds

23

statutes that have been enacted, and so it's a

24

forfeiture as well.

25

old statutes involving forfeitures of the proceeds of

And it's also quite similar to the

Alderson Reporting Company

customs offenses.

2

So I'm very happy on the facts of this

3

particular case to defend our position that this is a

4

forfeiture and as well as a penalty, I would say.

5

In response to Justice Sotomayor's question,

6

I have to say that the penal versus remedial dispute,

7

there's a certain "angels on the head of a pin" quality

8

of whether something is really penal or not.

9

the best way to answer this question is to look at,

I think

10

historically, what was the reason and the purpose of

11

that taxonomy.

12

And it's actually quite clear historically,

13

and the government doesn't even agree -- disagree with

14

this, that historically, there were basically two

15

categories of money payments to the government.

16

compensatory payments and there's punitive payments.

17

And, in fact, there's this case called Brady v. Daly,

18

which, in fact, this Court held applied to Section 2462,

19

in a subsequent case called Chattanooga, where the Court

20

says that a payment to a victim is remedial, and the

21

same payment to the government, in the context of the

22

qui tam action, is punitive.

23

categories.

24
25

There's

And those are the two

And so we think that that is what Congress
had in mind when it enacted 2462.

Alderson Reporting Company

It knew of two

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

categories, compensatory and penal.

2

remedies go to victims -- or -- or intended to

3

compensate the government for its own harm, and penal

4

remedies are not intended to compensate --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Compensatory

But that -- but that might

6

suggest something along the lines of what Justice

7

Ginsburg suggested, that if the government, in fact,

8

puts this money into the hands of victims, then it is

9

compensatory; whereas if the government keeps it, it's

10

not.

11

which is true.

And that the rule should follow, depending on

12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I think that the

13

government takes this money in the first instance, and I

14

don't think that the way the government happens to

15

distribute the money should affect the statute of

16

limitations.

17

many briefs that the government has cite -- filed for

18

the last 20 years, emphasizing that this isn't

19

compensatory.

20
21

And, again, I -- I point the Court to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It gets more complicated

than that, because the money goes to the court --

22

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
-- according to the

24

government, and it's the court that decides how the

25

money will be paid out, correct?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So this -- it depends.

2

There's -- there's one statute on Fair Funds, and in

3

some cases, you have disgorgements that go into there,

4

and there's a Sarbanes-Oxley statute that directs the

5

SEC to distribute that.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And then the question

7

becomes what you answered earlier, which is, if it's

8

being paid to the victim, is it really restitution as

9

opposed to disgorgement.

And if it's restitution, is it

10

compensatory damages subject to the existing statute of

11

limitations.

12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Right.

So if this was

13

genuine restitution, in other words, if the district

14

court entered a judgment and the judgment was the

15

government is standing in the shoes of a private

16

plaintiff, and there was a judgment in favor of some

17

class of victims, then it's possible that a different

18

set of statute of limitations would come into play.

19

that's the statute of limitations for private

20

plaintiffs.

21

We cite an old case called Beebe in our

22

reply brief, in which the Court holds that, in that

23

case, those statutes of limitations are imported as

24

against the government.

And

But because the government has

both in the context of the statute of limitations and

2

many other contexts.

3

Like, for instance, you know, the question

4

of whether disgorgement is equitable, we quote a brief

5

that the Commission filed in Eighth Circuit, where it

6

says, the reason that disgorgement is equitable is that

7

it's not restitution.

8

government says that criminal restitution judgments are

9

completely irrelevant to the calculation of disgorgement

It's not compensatory.

The

10

because it's not compensatory.

11

government's position is that victims don't even have

12

standing to challenge the way these funds are

13

distributed because disgorgement is not compensatory.

14

As I mentioned, the

So I think that the SEC should be taken at

15

its word and taking the positions they've been taking

16

for decades.

17

position that this is not restitution, the fact that

18

sometimes the SEC can distribute the money to the

19

victims shouldn't affect the nature of the remedy as the

20

SEC has been arguing for a long time.

21

And because the SEC has taken that

true in the criminal context, right?

The word "civil" is right there in the

So that is a statute of limitations applicable
And we think that this is a

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And because the government has successfully

2

opposed the argument that disgorgement is a form of

3

restitution, I think it should be taken at its word.

4

And this is a payment to the government and so the

5

restrictions against payments to the government apply.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could Congress pass a

7

statute giving the SEC the authority to bring these

8

actions for however long a period Congress chooses?

9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes.

So Section 2462 has

10

language that says something to the effect of, unless

Congress can enact unlimited

22

examples.

23

proceeds of crime, very similar to this, has a statute

24

of limitations, as does the civil actions for

25

forfeitures of proceeds.

So just to give a few

853(a)(1), which is forfeiture of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

Compensatory actions by the government also

2

have statutes of limitations.

3

someone for conversion to get money back, there's a

4

statute of limitations for that.

5

So if the government sues

Private causes of action, under the

6

securities laws, also have statutes of limitations.

7

all of those actions in some way could be characterized

8

as trying to get money back that was taken away.

9

And

So, essentially, what the government is

10

saying is there's this implied remedy that's kind of

11

right in between everything.

12

statute of limitations at all, because it kind of fits

13

somewhere and it's slightly different from everything.

14

And that's just not a particularly plausible position in

15

our view.

16

And, therefore, there's no

I mean, there's been a lot of questions from

17

the bench today about whether this is like restitution.

18

We've said it isn't, but I think a more salient point is

19

that restitution is also subject to statute of

20

limitations.

21

of wedging disgorgement in between all these other

22

things, it could bring actions unlimited in time we view

23

as quite an implausible position.

24
25

So the government's position that by sort

I'd just like to say one more word about
some of the government's inconsistencies in its

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

positions, because the government really has taken the

2

position in its brief that disgorgement is a penalty for

3

some reasons and not others.

4

So, for instance, take taxes.

The

5

government's position is that if Petitioner wants to

6

deduct this award from his taxes, he can't do that.

7

the reason why, per the government, is that disgorgement

8

is a penalty.

9

has taken this position, and I thought the government

That's what they say.

And

And the -- the IRS

10

might just say in its brief, or the SG's office, we're

11

not going to agree with the IRS.

12

position of the government.

13

We can state the

And they could have done that, but they

14

actually don't do that.

15

me, the government stands by that position, that it is a

16

penalty for purposes of this statute, but it is not a

17

penalty on his taxes.

18

The government says that there's this unspecified

19

textual and purposive differences, which it does not

20

elaborate upon.

21

The IRS stands -- or, excuse

And the government says -- why?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the government

22

took the position that you could deduct expenses, if the

23

measure of what is turned over is the ill-gotten gains,

24

then money made to reduce those costs incurred in -- in

25

making those gains, should be deducted.

Alderson Reporting Company

I didn't think

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

the government was saying -- I think the -- the court of

2

appeals said that, but that seemed to me quite wrong.

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think the government's

4

position -- and they can clarify if this is incorrect --

5

is that disgorgement, such as this disgorgement, is a

6

penalty for his taxes but is not a penalty for

7

Section 2462 purposes, simultaneously.

8
9

And it's also true for bankruptcy law.

The

question is -- the words "fine," "penalty," and

10

"forfeiture" are in the Federal bankruptcy statute, and

11

the government's position really is that disgorgement is

12

not dischargeable because it is a fine, penalty, or

13

forfeiture, but it is not a fine, penalty, or forfeiture

14

for purposes of the limitation period.

15

And it's true that there's a separate

16

provision for securities disgorgements in the bankruptcy

17

laws, but that doesn't apply to the disgorgements under

18

other statutes, such as the statute in which the

19

government previously took the position in this Court

20

that disgorgement was a fine, penalty, or forfeiture.

21

So I think that citizens are entitled to

22

basic consistency from the regulators, which doesn't

23

seem to have happened in the context of disgorgement.

24

And I'd like to reserve my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

Thank you.

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

7

For almost 50 years, courts have been

8

ordering disgorgement in SEC enforcement actions to

9

remedy unjust enrichment and put a defendant in the

10

position he would have been in if he hadn't violated the

11

law.

12

but when feasible, at the direction of the court, it's

13

distributed to the injured victims, either by the court

14

itself, by a trustee, by a receiver.

15

Courts sometimes send that money to the Treasury,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Goldenberg, in those 50

16

years, has -- has the SEC or has the Justice Department

17

ever set down in writing what the guidelines are for how

18

the SEC is going to use disgorgement and what's going to

19

happen to the monies collected?

20

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I'm not aware that it has.

21

It's -- the SEC's policy -- it's been stated in various

22

court decisions -- to ask the court to distribute the

23

money wherever that is feasible.

24

circumstances -- we've given an example of this in our

25

brief -- the SEC has said, well, we don't think it's

And in some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

feasible and the court said, well, we think it is

2

feasible; this money is going to be distributed.

3

it's ultimately in the control of the court.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

I must say I find it unusual

5

that the SEC has not given some guidance to its

6

enforcement department or -- or that the Department of

7

Justice hasn't become involved in some way; that -- that

8

everything is just sort of up to the particular person

9

at the SEC who decides to bring such a case.

10

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, as I say, I think

11

it's not up to the particular person at the SEC.

12

SEC may seek disgorgement and may make a recommendation

13

to the court about what should happen to the amounts,

14

but I think it's ultimately up to the court.

15

is exercising equitable discretion and deciding whether

16

disgorgement should be ordered in the first place, and

17

if so, how much, and if disgorgement is ordered, what

18

should happen to that money and where it should go.

19

I think that --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

So

Can -- can you give us any

indication -- can you give us any indication as in what

22

percentage of the cases the funds go to the victims?

23

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I can, Your Honor.

This

24

information isn't in the record and it also is not

25

completely derivable from SEC public reports, but I can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

tell you that the SEC has calculated, looking back at

2

the years 2013 to 2016, that money collected on

3

judgments entered during those years was disbursed to

4

the Treasury 43 percent of the time.

5

it was 33 percent of the time.

6

going to be the case that this money is going to get out

7

to victims.

8
9

From 2013 to 2015,

So it is very often

My friend referred to an amicus brief that
talks about an SEC public report, that talks about

10

collection amounts and disbursement amounts, and that

11

report just is comparing apples and oranges because it's

12

talking about amounts that are collected as to judgments

13

in certain years and then amounts that are disbursed in

14

a particular year.

15

of information about this.

16

So that report is not a good source

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One reason we have

17

this problem is that the SEC devised this remedy or

18

relied on this remedy without any support from Congress.

19

If Congress had provided, here's a disgorgement remedy,

20

you would expect them, as they typically do, to say,

21

here's a statute of limitations that goes with it.

22

including, as your friend says, usually a statute of

23

limitations and an accompanying statute of repose.

24
25

And

Now, it was a concern -- you know, Chief
Justice Marshall said it was utterly repugnant to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

genius of our laws to have a penalty remedy without

2

limit.

3

something like that and it's about a statute of

4

limitations.

5

Those were the days when you could write

It's utterly repugnant.
And it -- the concern, it sees seems to me,

6

is multiplied when it's not only no limitation, but it's

7

something that the government kind of devised on its

8

own.

9

I mean, I think -- doesn't that cause concern?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

No.

I think I disagree

10

with some of the premises of that.

11

Your Honor articulated is a principle that relates to

12

penalties, which are punishments, and for the reasons --

hasn't addressed it.

But, subsequent to the enactment of those

provisions, Congress has enacted many provisions that

talk about disgorgement, that express approval of

disgorgement, that showed that Congress understands

15

to me that we kind of have a special obligation to be

17

it's something that Congress did not address because it

18

did not specify the remedy.

19

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I mean, this remedy is out
But it does seem

Well, again, I think the

20

remedy is the equitable remedy that Congress did specify

21

when it gave that authorization to courts.

22

where I think the narrow construction principle comes

23

into play.

24

suggests, that you should sort of take a gestalt look at

25

the -- the world and say, well, it seems like Congress

But here is

It's not the case that, as my friend

Alderson Reporting Company

meant to have covered a bunch of things with different

characteristics, of disgorgement which are shared

23

neither by fines nor by forfeitures.

24

No

All right?

So I would like to

In what respect is disgorgement like neither
of those?

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Both fines -- excuse me --

2

and forfeitures, in our view, are -- as used in this

3

statute, so looking at what Congress would have intended

4

when it enacted it in 1839 -- are punishments.

5

disgorgement is not a punishment because it doesn't take

6

away anything that anyone was rightfully entitled to in

7

the first place.

8

and it takes the defendant back into the position the

defendant would have been in if the defendant hadn't

And here -- here you take

away things only that the person was not rightfully

That's correct.

Is there another one?

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I think they're all

along the same lines, which is that this is analogous to

restitution.

17

which is in antitrust cases --

18

It's analogous to the divestiture remedy,

JUSTICE BREYER:

A thing -- neither a fine,

19

nor a punishment -- I'm not being facetious, I'm -- I'm

20

trying to get it in my mind.

21

Neither a fine, nor a punishment takes from

22

someone a thing that he was not rightfully entitled to.

23

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

But disgorgement takes from

25

the person a thing that he -- no.

Alderson Reporting Company

Sorry.

The other way

Official - Subject to Final Review

38

around.

2
3

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes.

And maybe another way

to look at it --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

It takes away from a person

5

something that otherwise he would be rightfully entitled

6

to, and disgorgement takes away from a thing he would

7

not be rightfully entitled to.

8

MS. GOLDENBERG:

And I think maybe

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have I got it now?

11

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, you do.

9

another --

And I think

12

another way to look at it that might be helpful is

13

that --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

15

MS. GOLDENBERG:

-- fines, penalties,

16

forfeitures, even damages, can put the defendant in a

17

worse position than the defendant would have been in --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MS. GOLDENBERG:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is it --- if he had never --- kind of an unreality

21

to that argument because here there was a fine.

22

a relatively modest amount compared to the huge amount

23

awarded for this disgorgement.

24

the penalty, that's something added on, that's something

25

that he -- is he being punished by, say, 2 million.

It was

So to say, oh, the --

Alderson Reporting Company

2

But how much was the disgorgement in this
case?

3

MS. GOLDENBERG:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

much larger than the penalty.

6

MS. GOLDENBERG:

$35 million.
$35 million.

So it's

It is, and that's because

7

the penalty was time limited under this Court's decision

8

in Gabelli.

9

of conduct before the filing of the SEC's action,

So the penalty only covered the five years

10

whereas the disgorgement covered all of the bad conduct,

11

which went back further than five years.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MS. GOLDENBERG:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To point --

So what is the

difference from restitution?

17

MS. GOLDENBERG:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

So --

And I think that's

something that's really critical.

15
16

Right.

Well, I think -Why isn't this

restitution?

20

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I think there's an analogy

21

to restitution.

22

that both disgorgement and restitution are trying to put

23

the world back in joint when the world has been put out

24

of joint by something that the defendant has done.

25

So --

It is not dissimilar to restitution in

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if this is the

houseboat, why don't we call this restitution?

3

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, it's not restitution

4

in full, because restitution goes back to the harmed

5

parties.

6

harmed parties; sometimes doesn't.

7

it's necessary that it does go back to the harmed

8

parties for it to escape from the reach of the statute

of limitations.

10

And disgorgement sometimes goes back to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we don't think

Now, in forfeiture,

11

you're tracing in some metaphysical way a pot that has

12

been wrongfully taken.

13

MS. GOLDENBERG:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Yes.
And you are in

traditional forfeiture saying, give back that pot.

16

In this situation, we're not asking for that

17

pot.

Understood.
-- if it looks like a

forfeiture, why don't we treat it like a forfeiture?

Well, as I say, I would

19

like to talk about your -- your tracing point.

20

to make the point just to be clear, that proceeds

21

forfeiture didn't come into our law until 1978.

22

what says you got these proceeds from your crime; now

23

you have to give them up, you have to give them back.

And we don't think that forfeiture would have been

so there's not a tracing requirement the way that there

is in forfeiture, I think, basically for historical

reasons because of the history of in rem forfeiture.

disgorgement or restitution is not considered a penalty,

legitimate to have different interpretations of

Your answers to the

Our argument is that under 2462, as the

terms "penalty" and "forfeiture" should be understood

under this Court's decision in Meeker, they both refer

to doing something punitive, that disgorgement is not a

penalty or a forfeiture under this provision.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Again, I think this is an

2

issue of the scope of disgorgement that's not before the

out in a Ninth Circuit decision called Wallenbrock,

5

which points out that sometimes expenses can be

deducted.

7

business that you're running and you just are skimming

8

some money out of your clients' accounts, but you really

9

do have legitimate business expenses, in that

But the -- the analysis I think is best set

For instance, if you have a legitimate

10

circumstance, courts have allowed deduction of expenses

11

so as to make sure that you're just getting the unjust

12

enrichment.

13

If you're running a Ponzi scheme or

14

something of that nature and your whole business is a

15

fraud, in that circumstance, courts have not allowed

16

deduction of expenses because those expenses are really

17

just money that was stolen from the investors.

18

so --

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And

Ms. Goldenberg, when we

20

get to the criminal context, this very same remedy of

21

disgorgement of everything is often called a forfeiture,

22

and it is a penalty; right?

23

difference that we just happen to be in the civil

24

context?

So why does it make a

5

don't think it's exactly the same.

6

which, for instance, the government forfeits things in

has passed and -- in deciding whether to order

that in exercising this kind of equitable discretion,

So 20 years

talking about.

11

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, that's true.

But the

12

government has many incentives to move more quickly than

13

that.

14

I think that it's clear that all along the way, since

15

disgorgement has been --

16

You don't see cases like that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, in addition,

Well, if we -- if we

17

think that's inappropriate and bad, we're not going to

18

come out the other way because we trust the government

19

not to bring an action like that.

20

MS. GOLDENBERG:

21

Your Honor should trust the government.

What I'm saying

22

is that we're defending the status quo.

This is the way

23

it's worked for almost a half a century, and I think if

24

there had been some --

25

I'm not suggesting that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

No, no, this has

Official - Subject to Final Review

changed a lot after the Gabelli decision.

2

answer to Justice Ginsburg, that why did you get this

3

huge amount from disgorgement and only a small amount

4

under the other thing.

5

because Gabelli said we have to be bound by a particular

6

construction of the statute of limitations.

7

cut us off, now we're going to rely on disgorgement to

8

get all the money we -- that the Court said under

9

Gabelli, that you couldn't get.

10

That was your

And you said, well, that was

MS. GOLDENBERG:

And if that

I understand, Your Honor,

11

but Gabelli is actually an incentive for the SEC to move

12

faster, so that it gets the civil penalties.

13

actually, it is not true -- I think it's empirically not

14

true that the SEC's practices have changed since

15

Gabelli, that the SEC is somehow filing different kinds

16

of claims, or seeking disgorgement more often.

17

And,

We can statistically show, if you compare

18

the amount in disgorgement vis-à-vis penalties in 2009

19

versus 2016, there's actually way more disgorgement

20

compared to penalties; over $2 billion compared to only

21

$300-some million in penalties in 2009, long before

22

Gabelli.

23

government's incentives, it's to move faster, so that

24

penalties are still on the table.

25

So to the extent that Gabelli has shifted the

And something -- I really want to point out

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

something that's really important, I think, that the

2

facts of this case illustrate, which is that even if the

3

Court were to rule that Section 2462 covered

4

disgorgement, the government could still bring actions

5

more than five years after bad conduct, seeking

6

injunctions.

7

action, more than five years after the earliest of the

8

bad conduct, seeking disgorgement and penalties.

9

It could still bring actions like this

And so it's not as if the defendant would be

10

protected from having to defend himself against claims,

11

from having to bring witnesses, from having to come

12

forward with evidence.

13

of limitations.

14

remedies, not about actions.

15

This is not that kind of statute

This is a statue of limitations about

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -- if the -- if

16

it's beyond the statutory limitation, I suspect that an

17

injunction would be kind of irrelevant unless the

18

conduct has continued that long.

19

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, it's true that in

20

that such circumstance, you would show that there was

21

some danger of bad conduct in the future, but you would

22

use the existence of the bad conduct in the past as part

23

of that evidence.

24
25

So I think that there is not a danger
that -- that things are going to go awry here.

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress

1

has been aware this whole time,that disgorgement is

2

operating this way, including in pre-1990 cases that

3

were brought more than five years after the earliest of

the bad conduct.

5

I would like to emphasize one more time, if

6

I could, the narrow construction canon here, because I

7

think if the Court has any doubt about the meaning of

8

penalty and forfeiture, at the very least, those terms

9

are ambiguous.

10
11

We've come forward with all kinds of

contemporaneous sources -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We don't apply the canon

12

in criminal cases, so why should we apply it in a case

13

where the penalty is identical to what might be a

14

criminal penalty?

15

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, it's true that it's

16

not applied in criminal cases, where there are other

17

canons that are at play, like the canon --

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Like lenity.
Well, right.

And like the

20

canon against penalties that the Chief Justice was

21

referring to earlier.

22

something is a penalty or not in the first instance.

23

That would be a completely circular enterprise.

24
25

But that can't decide whether

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you agree or disagree --

I'm a little -- left a little bit unclear.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

Mr. Unikowsky's standard is that if something is not

2

solely remedial, then it's a penalty.

3

that?

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Do you agree with

I don't disagree that if

5

something has a punitive aspect, then it can be a

6

punishment.

7

10
11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you disagree with any

punitive aspect.
MS. GOLDENBERG:
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -So if something is not

solely remedial, it is a penalty.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

I disagree with the

13

principle that just because something has some deterrent

14

effect or deterrent purpose, that that makes it a

15

punishment, and that's a proposition that this Court has

16

rejected a number of times, in its decision in Hudson,

17

in its decision in Smith v. Doe, which is an ex post

18

facto case, and it has overruled a decision on that --

19

some of the decisions that Petitioner cites' relied on.

20

So the mere fact that something is deterrent

21

isn't enough to make it punitive.

22

deterrent, injunctions are a deterrent.

23

of things are a deterrent.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Damages are a
Lots and lots

Because I look at this

and -- and it seems to be a commonsensical kind of way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

of looking at the way this remedy works, the way the SEC

2

has used it, is that it's trying to do a lot of things.

3

It's trying to compensate.

4

trying, to some extent, to punish misconduct that it --

5

it sees, you know, and that it's a little bit artificial

6

to try to tear them apart.

7

Unikowsky's standard, that suggests that he has the

8

better of the arguments.

9

It's trying to deter.

It's

And then if you accept Mr.

So why is that wrong?

10

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well -- excuse me -- I

11

disagree that disgorgement is in any way intended to

12

punish, for the reasons that I was explaining to Justice

13

Breyer.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, but I guess -- I guess

15

when I said "punish," I don't mean to make that sound as

16

a conclusion.

17

particular misconduct.

18

relating to a -- an offense.

19

I mean just to say, it's tied to -- to
So -- so it's -- it's very much

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It is, but that's because

20

that's the conduct that gave rise to the unjust

21

enrichment that needs to be remedied.

22

remedial thing to do to say to the defendant, you got

23

this money that you were never supposed to have.

24

take it back and try to put the world back the way that

25

it was before.

And it is a

Let's

And, in many cases, we're going to go on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

and then give it to the injured parties, and we're going

2

to put the world completely back to the way that it

3

should have been, if you hadn't acted.

4

The mere fact that somebody has engaged in

5

wrongdoing is not enough to make any consequence that

6

flows from that a punishment, or injunctions would be a

7

punishment, declaratory judgments would be punishments,

8

all kinds of things would be punishments that we

9

wouldn't consider to be a punishment.

10

And -- and so I think, again, there's at

11

least some ambiguity here about what Congress meant in

12

1839 about what penalty and forfeiture meant.

13

that situation, the narrow construction canon comes into

14

play in favor of the government, and resolves this case

15

in favor of the government.

16

And in

Petitioner has suggested that the narrow

17

construction canon has no application here, because this

18

is not a situation in which the government is trying to

19

get back its own money or its own property.

20

just not correct, as a statement of how the narrow

21

construction canon works.

That is

22

The very cases that Petitioner cites talk

23

about the rationale for the narrow construction canon

24

being the protection of public interest or public rights

25

and property.

And one of the very cases the Petitioner

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

61
1

cites, the Badaracco case, was a case where the

2

government was acting in an enforcement capacity,

3

getting tax penalties from -- under a statute that is

4

described as a penalty statute.

5

So, again, I think it can't be --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

construction of what?

8
9

Narrow -- narrow

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Narrow construction of

Section 2462, to say that the words "penalty" and

10

"forfeiture" should be understood narrowly, rather than

11

as Petitioner would have it, extremely broadly to cover,

12

basically, any payment that ever goes to the government

13

in any way.

14

punishment, then disgorgement doesn't fall within the

15

scope of that.

16

And once you construe them narrowly to mean

And, again, I think it can't be that you can

17

sort of say, well, Congress would have meant to cover

18

this, if it had thought about it.

19

The canon, just as the canons that would

20

have to do with waivers of government sovereign immunity

21

and the like, says you have to look specifically at each

22

of the categories that Congress set up and see whether

23

the remedy that you're talking about falls within the

24

scope of that.

25

And here, that's certainly not the case.

We know that Congress has been active in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

62
1

this area; that Congress has passed a lot of statutes

2

that approve of disgorgement; that Congress has passed a

3

lot of statutes of limitations, including some that

4

apply to the SEC during the period in which disgorgement

5

has been ordered, and that Congress has never taken

6

action to cover disgorgement under a statute of

7

limitations, and Section 2462 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When -- when the SEC uses

this, is it usually going after continuing misconduct,

or does it sometimes really reach back into the past for

completed conduct?

15

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It's usually relating to

continuing misconduct.

18

before the filing of the complaint.

19

that -- that exist -- again, not a huge number -- they

11

And I want to be emphatic, that is not the
We are relying on the text of

We think this is a forfeiture and is a

penalty under the dictionary definitions of those terms.
So first, the word forfeiture would just

12

cite the dictionary and say that it's an order to turn

13

over money or property to the government as a result of

14

wrongdoing, which this is.

15

real-world usage of forfeitures that are almost

16

identical to this.

17

And we also point to the

And by the way, I point out that the

18

government says this is not forfeiture because it's not

19

punishment, but we cite lots of old sources dating back

20

to the 19th century in which courts were emphatic that

21

certain types of forfeitures, like these customs

22

forfeitures, which are very similar to disgorgement,

23

were remedial; they weren't even punitive.

24

relying on the literal text of the word forfeiture and

25

the history the way this Court has interpreted that

Alderson Reporting Company

So we're

64

word.

And we think that disgorgement falls within that.

2

And it's true that disgorgement is not

3

identical to forfeitures in 1830, but it's the same way

4

that school desegregation injunctions are not identical

5

to injunctions from 19 -- 1830 either.

6

still injunctions because they fall under the meaning of

7

that word.

8

of forfeiture.

But they're

And in the same way, disgorgement is a type

9

Similarly, we rely on what the word penalty

10

means, accompanied by this Court's decision saying that

11

partially penal remedies are, in fact, considered

12

penalties for various legal purposes.

13

The word "penalty" means a negative --

14

negative consequence of wrongdoing because of that

15

wrongdoing.

16

you've got to pay money to the government because you

17

did something bad, as opposed to because you want to

18

compensate the victim, and that characterizes

disgorgement.

In other words, you did something bad,

of that money is the amount of money he gained, this

As a result, he has to give

5

disgorgement.

6

this case.

7

The government has

It's part of a criminal

So we're happy to rely on the text in

I also want to talk about the dangers of

8

this implied remedy, because as there's some questions

9

from the bench that disgorgement seems to be an implied

10

remedy, there's no clear statutory authority.

11

danger of that is that disgorgement seems to keep

12

morphing in the government's briefs and positions.

13

And the

So, for instance, the government always

14

claims, as I mentioned, in lower courts, that the

15

compensation is just an ancillary aspect of -- of

16

disgorgement, its primary function is not compensatory,

17

and did that to beat down a whole bunch of legal

18

arguments such as the argument that private compensatory

19

statutes of limitations apply.

20

And now in this Court, when we point out

21

those positions, the SEC says, well, it's sometimes

22

compensatory, sometimes isn't, but the fact that merely

23

sometimes we're compensating people, that's enough to

24

make it compensatory enough to fall outside of

25

Section 2462.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

66
1

And by the way, the government counsel today

2

made very clear the SEC's position that it wants a

3

categorical rule under Section 2462.

4

that rule under bankruptcy law or tax law, because that

5

might decrease the amount of money that goes to the

emphatic that it wants categorical rule:

Disgorgement

So even in -- in these Foreign Corrupt

11

Practices Act cases where billions of dollars go into

12

the United States Treasury, and there's no prospect of

13

compensation to victims, the government says that's

14

disgorgement, and so that is not a penalty or

15

forfeiture.

16

if it prevails in this case.

17

And that will be the government's position

23

essentially the government's position.

24

25

there's no statute of limitations; therefore, it has

And that's the danger of allowing the

Alderson Reporting Company

Because it's an

Official - Subject to Final Review

67

more power to bring this remedy forever, and

2

characterizing it in different ways depending on the

3

litigation needs of the government.

4

I'd like to make one final comment about the

5

canon of construction, the narrow construction canon,

6

because, again, for 200 years, we haven't found any

7

cases in which the government had applied it in a case

8

like this one:

9

remedy to the government as sovereign.

A noncompensatory, backwards-looking
It just hasn't

10

applied it.

11

there's lots of cases in which the reverse canon of

12

construction has been used.

13

And there's lots of -- that way.

And

So we cite, for instance, the old Maillard

14

case and the old Adams case from the early Republic

15

where the Court is clearly saying that there's a

16

construction in favor of the statute of limitations

17

because, as Chief Justice Marshall said, it would be

18

utterly repugnant not to apply it.

19

We look at the Maillard case involving a

20

value customs forfeiture quite similar to this case in

21

which, again, the judge at the time -- it was a district

22

court -- refused to apply that canon because of the --

23

the court's view that it shouldn't apply in these

24

backwards-looking remedies.

25

And in fact, the Gabelli case itself I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

68
1

believe is quite strong for us on this, because in that

2

case, if there was some pro-government canon, it

3

wouldn't treat -- the court wouldn't treat the

government worse off than private plaintiffs.
