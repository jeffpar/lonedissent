ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Your Honor, when a police officer reasonably

12

thinks to himself, as Deputy Conley did here, this is

13

where I'm going to die, he has to be free to make the

14

split-second decision to defend himself and those around

15

him.

16

untenable.

Any legal rule that says that is unreasonable is

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You know, I have a -- it

18

is a very moving statement, and one that I totally agree

19

with, but we're not asking the police officers to make

20

that choice.

21

to take the step that's important to them, and I think

22

that's absolutely right.

23

When they feel in danger, they are going

The issue is who's going to suffer that

24

loss?

25

loss, not that that's the -- the death of the officer.

Who's going to take the financial penalty of that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

And so the question to me is not that one.

2

is when does the police officer pay the victim who is

3

suffering for that loss if the victim had nothing to do

4

with causing the loss?

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Understood.
Or -- or was justified

in whatever he or she did to protect themselves.

8
9

The question

So let's take the situation, which I think
you concede in your brief, that of the police officer

10

who, in the dead of night, in -- dressed in casual

11

clothes, breaks a window in someone's home and walks

12

into their home.

13

And we have given them the Second Amendment

14

right to victims, people who own homes, to possess

15

firearms to protect themselves.

16

stranger breaking in who doesn't announce themselves,

17

doesn't have a uniform, and is standing there breaking

18

in.

19

gun at that police officer, and the police officer takes

20

a gun and shoots them and injures them or kills them.

And the victim sees a

The victim shoots that police officer, or points a

21

Now who bears the financial loss in that

22

situation?

23

or herself and say it's my life or yours, or the police

24

officer who has taken unreasonable action in breaking

25

into a home in the middle of the night without

The homeowner, who has a right to defend him

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

announcing him or herself?

2

That's the question for me.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Understood, Your Honor.

3

And the answer to that question is quite likely the

4

officer, but not because of the provocation rule, but

5

rather because the officer has committed a clearly

6

unconstitutional act, which is not just entering, but

7

also failing to knock and announce, clear violation of

8

clearly established law, which then proximately causes

9

what -- what unfurls next.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let's -- let's

11

break that down, because I see two scenarios in this for

12

which a victim could -- could recover.

13

One is an unconstitutional violation that

14

proximately causes an injury.

15

you come to.

16

unreasonable use of force by the police officer.

17

taking out of the equation the second way of -- of

18

recovering?

19

Okay?

That's the theory

And the second is, if there was an

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

You're

The use

20

of force by the police officer at that moment was

21

reasonable.

22

for violating clearly established law, and in particular

23

here, failing to inform the homeowner that this is an

24

officer entering and what proximately flows from that.

25

But the police officer can be held liable

The problem with the latter theory, that is,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

the provocation theory, as an excessive force matter,

2

is -- there are multiple problems.

3

The first is it imposes liability under

4

Plaintiffs' approach for a new breed of constitutional

5

tort, which is creating a dangerous situation without

6

regard to whether it's a search or a seizure, or, under

7

your scenario, Justice Sotomayor, even the Ninth

8

Circuit's test, there is something very incongruous

9

about holding an officer liable for a use of force that

10

is not excessive at the moment at which it is used, and

11

therefore is reasonable, and therefore, in compliance

12

with the Fourth Amendment, and this goes --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's where I have -- '

Can I -I'm sorry.

Go ahead.

Can I ask about the first

17

theory, because you said if there was a violation --

18

excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death

19

or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then

20

there could be recovery.

21

Is that what you said?

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

25

That is what I said.
Yes.
So let me just -- let me

just amend with one -- I said one additional thing.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1
2

Knock-and-announce violation, and that
violation is a violation of clearly -- clearly --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- established law.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And this is qualified

Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

6

immunity context; everything has to be a violation of

7

clearly established law, quite right.

8
9

So I guess the question is, why is this case
any different?

In other words, this case you don't have

10

the knock-and-announce violation; you have a different

11

constitutional violation, which is an unauthorized

12

entry.

13

that the death or injury in such a case is also

14

proximately caused by that violation?

15

And why would it not be the case that the --

In other words, proximate cause says what

16

kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets

17

an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random

18

things we're not going to say are proximately caused.

19

But it doesn't seem to me a flukey or random thing to

20

say when there is an authorized entry into somebody's

21

home, violence may well result.

22

cause analysis seems to flow in much the same way, maybe

23

not to quite the same -- like with -- quite the same

24

obviousness, but in much the same way as in your

25

knock-and-announce example.

And so the proximate

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, so -- let's

2

just be clear where we are.

We're not talking about

3

starting with the violation; that is, the

4

knock-and-announce violation, or the violation of -- of

6
7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's -- it's a simple

question, Mr. Rosenkranz.

8

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
You said something about

10

knock and announce.

I say why isn't the same theory

11

applicable when the constitutional violation is

12

unauthorized entry into somebody's home?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

For a very simple reason,

14

Your Honor.

15

established violation.

16

failure to call a judge in advance and, for example, get

17

a telephonic warrant.

18

We've got to start with a clearly

19

entry into somebody's home.

20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

Yes, it is.
So that is the clearly

established constitutional violation.

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

That is an unauthorized

Correct.
Why isn't the proximate

cause -- why it -- why wouldn't it be that a death or

1

injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into

2

somebody's home without legal authorization, that one of

3

the things that foreseeably can result from that is a

4

shooting?

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, the

6

answer is that calling the judge in advance would not

7

have made a bit of difference in this case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well suppose -The facts -Suppose this case, police

And he sues -- and later

And he sues for fright and

Under your theory, you'd say, well, even

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That's correct, Your Honor,

because the warrant requirement -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then -- then we simply

23

have no way to enforce the warrant requirement.

24

so you stand by the proposition that if there is an

25

unlawful entry, an unlawful arrest because of a lack of

Alderson Reporting Company

a warrant, no damage because the arrest would have

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I'm not saying no damage,

8

but certainly not the physical injury that occurred

here.

But let me play out the reason for the answer,

Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yeah, let's stick with

if there's an entry without a warrant if there had been

probable cause otherwise.

that's so, I'd like the citation for that case.

For -- for that.

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

21

search --

If the search would have

24

happened no matter what, yes, there may be humiliation,

25

sure, because, I mean, if -- if the warrant would have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

prevented that humiliation, then you could sue for it.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, let's assume that it

3

wouldn't.

4

because a judge would have ordered the arrest.

5

In fact, it would have been even worse

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

6

definitely no damage.

Hughes, the homeowner, who was -- there was no warrant

11

and she was placed in a car and treated rather badly,

12

would she have a 1983 claim?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

She may well have a 1983

14

claim, Your Honor, for -- for the poor treatment when

15

she was not actually a criminal.

16

do want to get to Justice Kennedy's question and link it

17

to the answer that I never got to, to Justice Kagan.

But I do need to -- I

On the facts presented in this appeal, the

19

judge would have granted the warrant no matter what

20

because the deputies had probable cause.

21

deputies then would have done exactly what they did

here, and the result would have been exactly the same.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This Court said in Grubbs

Well, it's -- it's possible.

5

I mean, I take the point, Mr. Rosenkranz, it's possible

6

that you have a warrant in your pocket and you don't say

7

anything about it, although that would seem like very

8

silly -- stupid police work.

9

when somebody has a warrant is that they tell a

But the prototypical case

10

homeowner they have a warrant and that they have a right

11

to be on the premises.

12

That's what usually happens.

And similarly, what often happens is that

13

when somebody doesn't say that to a homeowner, they are

14

making it far more likely that violence will ensue.

15

certainly the kind of violence that could ensue is not

16

the kind of flukey, random stuff that is filtered out by

17

a proximate cause inquiry.

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And

Your Honor, I -- I

19

disagree.

20

before executing a warrant is not the fact that they

21

have a warrant, but because there is a separate

22

constitutional command of knocking and announcing with

23

24

the officers made here.

briefly, though, that -- that what you've done now with

decision that the officer makes at that moment, which is

the critical decision under Graham, but to find that

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

23

We have two questions in this case.

think I'd like to pick up with that -- where my

co-counsel left off, which was with Justice Breyer's

And I

question, which I think goes to the first question

2

presented.

3

just say that we can consider the facts of causing the

4

situation as part of the reasonableness inquiry?

5

And I think the question was, why can't we

And the answer there is because the question

6

that we're answering under Graham is, was the officer's

7

force -- use of force reasonable in the circumstances

8

that he faced?

9

sets of facts.

10

And those -- those depend really on two

One:

What was the individual doing?

11

the person a threat?

12

propensity to use it?

13

risk?

Did he have a weapon?

Was

A

Was a member of the public at

Was he fleeing, committing a crime, et cetera?

14

And two:

15

What were the officer's options?

16

the officer's use of force proportional, et cetera?

17

How did the officer respond to it?

It doesn't ask whether the police officer

18

created the situation.

shoes, the situation --

20

What did the -- was

It takes stepping into the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why is it that every

21

Graham case we look at, all the car chase cases, every

22

single one of them, we -- when we're talking about the

23

situation facing the officer, we look at everything the

24

officer and the victim did that led up to the moment of

25

confrontation.

Because all of the facts that you point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

to as the police officer's knowledge of the victim are

2

facts that usually are intertwined with what led up to

3

the incident.

4

So if you look at a car chase, you're

5

looking at a person who, over an extended period of

6

time has driven a car crazily, has put other people at

7

risk, has swerved and missed other cars, done a series

8

of things that the officer is aware of because he

9

participated in the chase, and at the moment that he is

10

looking at what the victim -- what the defendant is

11

doing, he's saying he drove the car and almost hit

12

another car, he's pointing the car at me, he's going to

13

hit me.

14
15

And -- but you're looking at both sides of
that equation.

16

You're not ratcheting it up on one side

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, you're right that

17

you're looking at all of the facts and circumstances,

18

but those that bear on whether the use of force is

19

reasonable.

20

And just to give an example, in Plumhoff,

21

which is one of the car chase cases that the Court

22

addressed, the district court in that case said well,

23

the police officer was chasing him, so the police

24

officer helped create the dangerous situation, and this

car, of a total stranger on the street, and the person

is coming at them, should that person behind the wheel

12

bear the brunt of an injury because the police officer

13

says the car was coming towards me, so to save myself, I

pulled the gun and shot them, even though this is Joe

Why does a police officer get a pass on that?

19

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, as a general matter,

20

Section 1983 is about courts setting clearly established

21

constitutional rules for the police that the police have

22

to follow.

23

police just behaved reasonably in the abstract, but in

24

terms of each thing that the police officer did and

25

whether it followed the established rule, the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is it -Counsel --

-- for a police officer

5

to pull a gun and shoot a driver that has no guilt

associated with him or her?

7

normal person to stumble into the street and say, I'm a

8

police officer, I'm going to seize that person and stop

9

myself by being injured by shooting that person?

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

Not an armed felon, just a

Well, I think you would ask

11

in that question what -- whether there really was a

12

threat that the officer was responding to, and I think

13

you're positing a situation where there really wasn't a

14

threat there.

15

everyone recognized that there was a threat facing these

16

officers who are going about doing their police business

17

in good faith, and they see a person pointing what

18

appeared to be a gun at them.

20

else that you did that day, and even though this use of

force was reasonable under Graham, we're going to hold

22

you liable for it.

23

But I think in this circumstance,

And what the Ninth

We're going to second-guess everything

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, it -- it --

24

I just want to put the discussion so far this morning in

25

the right framework.

We're talking about the second

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

question presented, right?

2

me, to be involved the provocation rule in the Ninth

3

Circuit, at least the question about did they get a

4

warrant, did they knock, announce.

5

understand the Ninth Circuit's provocation rule in

6

distinction to what we've been talking about in terms of

7

proximate cause and things like that?

8

MS. SAHARSKY:

9

None of this, it seems to

Sure.

How do you

The provocation rule

takes, under the Ninth Circuit's precedence, a

10

reasonable use of force and deems it unreasonable

11

because the police made an earlier constitutional

12

mistake, and we think that that is just flatly wrong.

13

You should --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So as -- as that's

15

describe -- is the label what's wrong?

16

think of provocation is something fairly immediate,

17

something that causes the pulling of the gun by the --

18

the victim or something like that.

19

as provocation that you should have gotten a search

20

warrant earlier in the day but you didn't, and that led

21

to this.

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

I -- I would

I don't think of it

I mean the thing that's wrong

23

is what the Ninth Circuit is doing, which is saying the

24

police created the situation by doing things that are

25

not constitutional violations, but that the Ninth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

Circuit later finds, with the benefit of 20/20

2

hindsight, to be reasonable -- unreasonable.

3

actually what we've seen.

4

And that's

We've had this doctrine in the Ninth Circuit

5

for 20 years now.

6

put in place clear rules for the police.

7

of things that the Ninth Circuit is second-guessing is,

8

maybe the police should have used a hostage negotiator

9

for longer before going into the house in Alexander.

It's incredibly ill-defined, does not
And the kinds

10

That's the one with the sewage seeping outside of the

11

12

that guy.

13

negotiator.

They tried to spend a month trying to talk to

14

They went to his house.

Used a hostage

Or the situation in Sheehan where there was

15

a very difficult situation with a mentally ill woman who

16

was threatening the police, and the Ninth Circuit said

17

the police should have tried to calm down the situation

18

for longer.

19

determinations that are being made.

20

Circuit's rule, the Ninth Circuit's just second-guessing

21

doing exactly what this Court has said shouldn't be

22

done.

I mean, these are incredibly difficult

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

MS. SAHARSKY:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And under the Ninth

But isn't --

So the best --- isn't that a little bit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

different than the provocation rule at 25(a) where they

2

say there was no warrant and therefore there's -- those

3

are two different things, right.

4

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

We understand those

5

to be the two alternative holdings from the first

6

question presented and the second question presented.

7

So the second question presented isn't

8

talking about whether the use of force is

9

constitutionally excessive, clearly established

10

violation.

11

with the entry and did that proximately cause the

12

damages at issue.

13
14

It's talking about, was there a violation

And if I can address that question.

We just think there's a fundamental
problem --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

MS. SAHARSKY:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you --- with the Ninth's --- before -- can I just --

18

do you agree in general, before you address the question

19

in particular, do you agree in general what that

20

framing -- that if there is an independent

21

constitutional violation and if it does proximately

22

cause the injury, then there's a 1983 action?

23

MS. SAHARSKY:

In general, yes.

I mean,

24

1983 imposes liability and damages for clearly

25

established constitutional violations, and although this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

Court has had very few opportunities to address

2

causation in the Section 1983 context, it has said as a

3

general matter it would start with tort law principles,

4

and I think those would include proximate causation and

5

superseding-cause principles.

6

But we have a problem in this case in what

7

the Ninth Circuit found was the proximate cause of the

8

injuries in this case was the failure to knock and

9

announce.

But the fail -- failure to knock and announce

10

was not a violation of clearly established law.

11

officers have qualified immunity for that.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

So that seems fair enough.

13

But then the question might become, whether here or on

14

remand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a

15

clearly established violation, whether one could say

16

that that was the proximate cause of the shooting.

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

And I think there's two

18

answers to that question, one about this case and

19

second, more generally.

20

About this case, the analysis by the Ninth

21

Circuit was that it was the knock-and-announce and not

22

the warrant, and if I could just illustrate this.

23

this case, you had officers that did not have a warrant

24

and did not knock and announce.

25

did have a warrant and still didn't knock and announce.

In

But imagine that they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

What the Ninth Circuit said was the problem was the

2

startling entry.

3

would have had this problem from the knock-and-announce,

4

but as we discussed, the knock-and-announce is

5

immunized.

6

So with or without the warrant, you

As a general matter, I think the point that

7

Petitioners were making at argument and in their -- in

8

the brief is well taken, that the scope of the risks for

9

a warrant violation as opposed to the scope of the risk

10

for a knock and a -- knock-and-announce violation are

11

very different.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But one of -- a warrant

13

violation is just -- it's -- it's just saying

14

unauthorized entry.

15

within the normal scope of the risk, but an unauthorized

16

entry produces violence, not that it always or probably

17

produces violence, but that it might produce violence in

18

the way we kind of ask when we do proximate cause

19

analysis.

20

And the question is whether it's

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

And I don't think

21

that we would say that an unauthorized entry itself

22

normally produces violence when you're talking about --

23
24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Doesn't have to, normally.

It doesn't have to -MS. SAHARSKY:

Proximate cause --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1
2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Or -- you know, proximate

cause is just we filter out the really fluky stuff.

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I -- we understand

4

proximate cause in the scope of the risks as being what

5

are the natural and probable consequences of your

6

actions, what are the risks that make the conduct

7

tortious, what bad things do you think are going to

8

occur if you do this.

9

And in the warrant context, we're talking

10

about police showing up at the door.

11

think that it is generally a reasonable reaction when

12

police show up at the door with or without a warrant

13

that you'd react violently.

14

is that when the police come to your door, you submit at

15

that time, and that you can challenge the warrant in

16

court later.

And, no, we don't

And that's what Grubbs said

17

Could I have one more sentence?

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19
20

Well -- and also if

you could get to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Okay.

Just to finish this,

21

but the Court has recognized that you have a problem in

22

the knock-and-announce context that you don't know that

23

they are the police.

24

really is a potential risk of violence.

25

that they're the police, a citizen is expected to stand

And so in that context there

Alderson Reporting Company

Once you know

down.

2

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, if I

3

remember it, I think is an arrest without probable cause

4

and the damages that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh, I'm sorry.

MS. SAHARSKY:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

But there was a failure to

get a warrant.

11

13

There -- there is probable

cause --

8

10

No, no --

Yes.
And there should have been

a warrant.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

I think that the

15

question you would ask in that case is the normal

16

proximate cause question about what kind of damages, you

17

know, would there be from a failure to get a warrant in

18

those circumstances, what's natural and foreseeable.

19

I'm -- I wouldn't say --

20
21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

And if the humiliation is

the same either way, no damage?
MS. SAHARSKY:

I'd -- I'm not saying that it

23

depends on whether proximate cause and you could have

24

gotten a warrant.

25

actually happened and determine the -- the natural and

I'm just saying that you look at what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28

probable consequences from that.

2
3
4

I mean, the Court -- just maybe one more
sentence.
The Court has not had a lot of opportunities

5

in the 1983 concept -- context to work out these

6

probable cause cases.

7

other opinions you've said probable cause is a very

8

flexible concept.

9

experience doing it, this Court less, and that's why we

I think in some of the Court's

Courts of appeals have a lot of

10

would say to decide the second question presented very

11

narrowly and not get into all of these questions.

question on that?

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical that there had been an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. FELDMAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6
7

MR. FELDMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

8

If the Court reaches the constitutional

9

issue in the case, we believe that the Court should

10

adopt the following standard:

11

official takes action that foreseeably creates a need

12

for the use of force and results in that use of force,

13

Graham Scott balancing should be applied to determine

14

whether that action is objectively unreasonable.

15

Where a government

And we are not, as Petitioners' counsel

16

suggested, suggesting to this Court that it adopt a new

17

breed of a constitutional tort.

18

focused on the totality of the circumstances and there

19

is a long line of cases culminating in Kentucky v. King

20

that recognizes the constitutional significance of

21

predicate acts.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This Court has always

Can you repeat that

standard?
MR. FELDMAN:

The standard that we suggest

that this Court adopt is that where a government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

official takes action that foreseeably creates a need

2

for the use of force and results in that use of force,

3

Graham Scott balancing should be applied to determine

4

whether that action is objectively unreasonable.

5

Under Graham and Scott, courts would, of

6

course, consider the governmental interest at stake, the

7

nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's

8

Fourth Amendment interests, and the relative culpability

9

of those affected by the decision.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you defending the

11

Ninth Circuit's statement at page 22A of the Petition

12

Appendix?

13

the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by searching

14

the shack without a warrant, which proximately caused

the plaintiff's injuries, liability was proper."

"Here the District Court held that, because

MR. FELDMAN:

That is an appropriate way to

17

find liability in this case.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I just don't see the

was those circumstances that are the objectively

2

unreasonable behavior of the officers --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, not the second

one.

5

determined -- and I understand you to accept it -- that

6

that was not a violation of clearly established law.

I thought the -- the failure to announce they

7

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

And so what

8

that means is that the cause of action cannot be

9

brought, but the conduct doesn't disappear.

And

10

proximate cause principles are not based on whether a

11

legal violation proximately caused harm, but whether the

12

conduct caused harm.

13

in this case was the entry without giving notice.

14

you take either one of those away, then, of course, the

15

harm doesn't occur.

16

are both necessary proximate causes as well as but-for

17

causes.

18

And the conduct that caused harm
If

That's another way of saying they

And when we look at the Kentucky v. King

19

line of cases, what we see is that this Court has

20

recognized that there are circumstances in which events

21

allow police officers to take certain actions.

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's -- that was a

23

different context.

24

the warrant requirement.

25

test, as you articulate it, and as I understand it, is

It had to do with an exception to
But the problem with your

that you start out with something that is said to be

2

unreasonable, but it is not a violation of the Fourth

3

Amendment.

4

not for the ultimate decision to use deadly force.

5

And you impose liability for that decision,

And -- and this has come up in a situation

6

like Sheehan where there's a dispute about whether it's

7

reasonable for -- you have a -- a mentally disturbed

8

person and let's say the person has a hostage in a house

9

or there's an innocent person there and the mentally

10

disturbed person is acting in a way that seems to

11

present a serious threat to the -- the innocent person

12

in the house.

13

reasonable for the police to enter as opposed to waiting

14

for a -- a psychological expert or -- or they only have

15

negotiations for a short period of time before they

16

enter and it's argued that wasn't reasonable, that's not

17

good police practice, they should have waited a longer

18

period of time, and you end up imposing liability.

19

And there's a dispute about whether it's

And then once they go in, then they're in

20

a -- in a life-threatening situation and they use force.

21

You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a

22

violation of best police practices, or something that is

23

recommended by experts in this situation.

24

anomalous about the rule that you've -- that you've

25

suggested.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's what's

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

MR. FELDMAN:

I wouldn't agree that it's

2

anomalous, but I also think that, at least in this case,

3

unlike in Sheehan, the Court doesn't have to decide

4

whether objectively unreasonable behavior alone is

5

enough because we also happen to have an unlawful entry,

6

which wasn't present in the Sheehan case.

7
8

When the officers entered, they were no
different than trespassers.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And some -Well, but that's a different

10

way of looking at the situation.

11

that's a -- you know, that's -- that's the question that

12

you would think you would address under the Fourth

13

Amendment.

14

violation, and then you say, did it proximately cause

15

the use of deadly force?

16

suggested where you start out with something that isn't

17

a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether or not it

18

represents best police practices or not.

19

And I agree, that

You start out with the Fourth Amendment

MR. FELDMAN:

But not the rule that you

Let me give you a few

20

examples, Justice Alito, of why it's important to focus

21

on the predicate conduct.

22

and decisions that have been -- and circumstances --

23

that have been addressed by the Department of Justice

24

and -- and this Court.

25

These are real-world examples

In Chicago, there's a problem with officers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

who jump out of unmarked cars wearing plain clothes

2

brandishing guns.

3

There's no seizure, but it's clearly unreasonable and it

4

leads to the use -- unnecessary use of force.

5

It's not a constitutional violation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it may very well be a

6

seizure.

7

of the person who they approach, then it's a -- then

8

it's a seizure, it's a stop.

If they -- if they interfere with the liberty

9

MR. FELDMAN:

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

It -- it -And that would be the

11

situation in the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor

police officer jumps in front of a car and doesn't allow

the driver enough time to stop.

15

is approaching the police officer, the police officer

16

shoots.

17

entire seizure, the jumping in front of the car, plus

18

the ultimate shooting to determine whether it's

19

reasonable.

20

That's a seizure.

MR. FELDMAN:

And then as the driver

And so you look at the

And there's nothing wrong with

21

that approach either in the Kentucky v. King argument.

22

I think Justice Kagan referred to that as the holistic

23

unreasonableness approach.

24

the moment of time that the officers interact with

25

somebody to the moment that there is a seizure, here

If you look at the -- from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

that's the moment that the officers arrived at the

2

Mendez's home until the moment that the officers fired

3

their weapons into the Mendez's home and injured them,

4

which effectuated the seizure.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the Fourth Amendment

6

doesn't prohibit unreasonable interactions.

7

prohibits is unreasonable searches and seizures.

8

it's entirely appropriate to look at the whole seizure,

9

but not this chain of interactions that includes a lot

What it
So

10

of things that happened before there ever is conduct

11

that implicates the Fourth Amendment.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, in the examples that

13

we've given where the police officer goes into someone's

14

home in the middle of the night or stands outside

15

someone's home brandishing weapons or jumps out of a car

16

brandishing weapons, that's the beginning of the

17

interaction.

18

circumstances, as this Court has repeatedly mandated,

19

among those circumstances is the objectively

20

unreasonable behavior of the officers that foreseeably

21

and directly leads to the use of force.

22

And if we look at the totality of the

So whether we look at it through the

23

Kentucky v. King framework, which is really where

24

unreasonable or unconstitutional conduct prevents an

25

officer from relying on certain circumstances to avoid

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

liability or we look at it holistically, there is an

2

enormous amount of evidence in this record what the --

3

what these officers did was unreasonable.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how?

How is that?

That

5

is, what I think the argument on the other side is in

6

response, I was looking saying look holistically.

7

seizure is the shooting and his -- and his injury, okay?

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

The

Right.
The question is, would any

reasonable person think that that was unreasonable?

11

Now, we break it down.

Not unreasonable to

12

the shoot in the situation.

13

Seems, too, they -- they say not unconstitutional or

14

unreasonably wrong not to knock and announce, because

15

that's what the Ninth Circuit found, and the part that

16

was wrong, not getting a warrant, made no difference.

17

So they're saying zero plus zero plus zero, it must

18

equal zero.

19

trying to -- to put that I -- that I want to hear the

20

answer to.

21

Okay?

That wasn't unreasonable.

That, I think, is the argument I'm

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

And I think the flaw

22

in the reasoning is that what we have here are two

23

10

MR. FELDMAN:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Right.

Because what the -So -- so why do you

look at that as the basis for 1983 liability?

13

MR. FELDMAN:

Because what they're doing,

14

Mr. Chief Justice, is they are changing the legality of

15

the conduct, but they are not changing the conduct.

16

When you change the legality of the conduct, but you

17

don't change the conduct, of course this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then it's

not -- it's -- it's -- and this, I think, is the

argument on the other side.

is the only thing that violated the standards under

Then it's irrelevant.

define proximate cause.

That either did or did not

proximately cause the harm.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FELDMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

It has to be illegal.
But -- but then why

are we talking about the failure to get a search

18

Why -- why did that make a difference?
MR. FELDMAN:

It made a difference in this

case because it is what makes the conduct of the police

officers unconstitutional.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That does not

distinction.

3

look, the entry without authority, the entry without a

4

warrant, that's a clear but-for cause of the shooting?

5

The shooting wouldn't have happened if there hadn't been

6

the entry; right?

I mean, it -- it -- why isn't it just,

7

MR. FELDMAN:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Right.
Now the question is, is it a

but -- is it a proximate cause of the inquiry?

And

10

it -- and it seems to me that you have to make a case --

11

and tell me if you agree or don't agree:

12

make a case that unauthorized entry, that one of the --

13

one of the things that foreseeably can happen with an

14

unauthorized entry is that the person whose home it is

15

will react with violence.

MR. FELDMAN:

You have to

I agree with you completely.

And, of course --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FELDMAN:

Well --

-- the foreseeability issue

was the issue that was extensively litigated in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I don't

23

see how you can agree -- I don't think it's -- addresses

24

at least my concern, which -- why and in what way did

25

the failure to get a warrant cause everything that

followed?

3

MR. FELDMAN:
caused --

It was the entry that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It was the entry.

I'm with you there.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.
I understand that.

8

But the failure to get a warrant did not cause the

9

entry.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

As I understand courts'

11

applying proximate cause analysis, we begin with the

12

conduct and we ask ourselves, did that conduct

13

directly -- that's the proximate cause issue -- did that

14

conduct directly lead to the harm?

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

Right.

If we answer that question

yes, we then look at whether that conduct was illegal.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Now, there --

19

and maybe I'm just asking the same thing over and over

again.

conduct, the failure to get the warrant, lead to the

entry in this case?

And, if so, I apologize.

Can I say this --- same thing -But I guess maybe I

caused the -- the confrontation; is that right?

10

MR. FELDMAN:

I wouldn't say that the

The

caused the entry.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

know why the failure to get a warrant matters.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Exactly.

So I don't

Well, can I suggest why it

19

might matter?

20

One is -- let's -- for these purposes, one is an

21

authorized entry and one is an unauthorized entry.

22

I mean, there are two kinds of entry:

Now the question is, what kind of conduct

23

does each of those kinds of entries provoke?

24

an authorized entry, you don't really think that it's

going to provoke violence.

But if you're an

violence.

So the --

the proximate results of each of those two different

kinds of entry are very different.

Counsel, if I could

interrupt you to ask a question.

They say:

Now, is there more -- is it more likely that

19

there's going to be violence in the second situation

20

than in the first situation?

21

there is.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I -- I don't see why

I would agree, Your Honor,

23

that in those circumstances, it would not be more likely

24

that there would be violence in one situation or the

25

other.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then, then I don't see

where there's proximate cause.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, the proximate cause

4

comes from the two things that the officers did that led

5

directly and foreseeably to the confrontation and the

6

violent confrontation with the homeowners.

7

they decided to enter, and that was unconstitutional.

8

And the other is that they went in without giving any

9

notice.

10

One is that

And if you look at that through -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're making a

11

presumption there that I think you have to address,

12

which is, yes, they entered without a warrant.

13

assuming it's unconstitutional.

14

and I don't think the Court did below, whether that

15

entry had an exception for unconstitutionality.

16

an exigent circumstance or not?

17

You're

No one's addressed it,

Was it

You're assuming that they didn't have a

legal motive for entry.

19

assumption, but let's assume that a court below could

20

say that the entry was lawful because it was pursuant to

21

exigent circumstances.

I'm willing to start with that

22

What would happen to your argument then?

23

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, let me start by

24

clarifying that the courts below did, in fact, address

25

the full panoply of exceptions to the warrant clause.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

the entry was unlawful.

3

in this case.

So we're assuming that

There were no exceptions to it

4

MR. FELDMAN:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Correct.
Yeah.

And in my

6

hypothetical, the -- what I -- I neglected to say but

7

should have said was that there weren't exigent

8

circumstances.

9

they had a warrant -- they -- they -- but you still have

So the -- the entry was unlawful, but

10

those two situations.

11

The other case, they say:

12

to be wrong -- that we don't need a warrant.

In one case, they have a warrant.
We think -- and they turn out

13

But I don't -- I asked you whether there's a

14

greater risk of violence in one than the other, and I --

15

I'd like to hear your -- your answer.

16

be a greater risk of violence in the situation where

17

the -- the resident knows that it's -- that they are

18

police officers and they're going to conduct a search,

19

as opposed to the situation where there's -- where

20

there's a warrant?

21

both situations; right?

Any -- any violence that the

2

MR. FELDMAN:

They know that they're police

officers --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

"You know, I know -- I know

4

you're a police officer, but I don't think you really

5

have an exception to the warrant requirement, so I'm

6

going to shoot you."

7

They can't do that, can they?

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feldman, you said there

No.

11

are two kinds of entrance; right?

12

entrant, and one is a nontrespasser entrant.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

One is a trespasser

Right.
A guest entrant, let's call

the person; right?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
And when a trespasser enters

18

your home, different sets of things foreseeably

19

happen --

20

MR. FELDMAN:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

-- than when a guest enters

your home.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Correct.

Correct.
So it's not just an entry.

The question is, who's entering:

a trespasser or a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

guest?

2

MR. FELDMAN:

Correct.

And that is the

3

problem with this case, is that when the officers pulled

4

back the blanket, there was no indication and -- and no

5

reason for them to know that the Mendezes knew that they

6

were police officers.

7

So in the trespasser example, if the

8

homeowner has a Second Amendment right -- obviously, she

9

does -- to point that weapon at the trespasser and the

10

trespasser then shoots the homeowner, that's murder.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

wait.

But -- but here, wait,

Ordinary tort law, let's pick up on this for a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
And don't answer it if it's

a red herring.

17

causation.

18

it's about whether a reasonable person -- namely, a

20

policeman -- would know in the circumstances that what

21

he was doing was unconstitutional.

22

Shooting someone.

23

But, look, everybody is talking about

Maybe this isn't about causation.

Perhaps

What was he doing?

Why would he know it was unconstitutional?

24

Well, here in ordinary tort law, Case 1, the trespasser

25

reasonably believes, but wrongly believes, that he is an

2

Case 2:

3

Does that make a difference to the result?

Okay?

It absolutely does make a

difference to the result.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. FELDMAN:

Because?

Because the legal principles

that apply in those circumstances are different.

9

homeowner has a right to use force against an unlawful

The

10

entrant.

11

officer, not because of the knock-and-announce rule, but

12

because he sees the uniform, then the rules change.

13

If the trespasser comes in and says, wait a second, I'm

14

just your neighbor and I'm looking for some, you know,

15

need to use your telephone, the rules would change.

16

If the entrant is known to be a police

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- just thinking, you

17

know, we want policemen to protect themselves.

18

have to.

19

circumstances where, of course, that's true that they

20

have a right to protect themselves, but the background

21

circumstances are such that there's no justification for

22

the whole ball of wax.

Of course they do.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

They

But there can be

Correct.

And that --

That's, I think, what your

argument is in respect to the warrant, if not the knock

2

the whole ball of wax which has less justification, and

3

it is clear that the action from A to Z is what caused

4

the death.

5

argued that, so I'm a little hesitant to bring it up.

So it's

Now, would -- you haven't really strongly

6

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, in a sense that's the

7

Petitioners' test, but -- but not quite.

8

the Petitioners would tell you is that you can at least

9

give these officers knowledge of what has happened

I mean, what

10

beforehand.

11

knew, which I think goes to the holistic reasonableness.

12

And here's the four things those officers

First, they knew they were entering

13

someone's house, not -- not subjectively, objectively.

14

The reasonable officer on the scene knew that they were

15

going into someone's house.

16

officer on the scene knew it was an unlawful entry.

17

objectively reasonable officer on the scene knew that

18

this was the Mendezes' house.

19

reasonable officer on the scene knew that the Mendezes

20

had no way of knowing that the officer was a police

21

officer.

22

unreasonable and it is a Fourth Amendment violation to

23

use force.

The objectively reasonable
The

And the objectively

So in that circumstance, it is objectively

24

If we look at it holistically, if we look at

25

it through sort of the segmented approach of Kentucky v.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

King, then it's the unreasonable actions that got the

2

police officer into that situation that preclude him

3

from avoiding liability based on the fact that

4

Mr. Mendez moved a gun.

5

And I would agree with the comments that

6

were made earlier that this isn't about telling police

7

officers they can't take actions to protect themselves.

8

We know that they will.

9

bears the brunt of the officers' unreasonable conduct?

The question in the end is who

10

Because there's no allegation here that the Mendezes did

11

anything wrong.

12

If somebody comes into your house and you

13

move a gun, you have a Second Amendment right to do

14

that.

15

Fourth Amendment tells you that you can do anything you

16

want as long as it's not illegal.

17

certainly isn't illegal.

If you're in the privacy of your own home, the

18

And moving a gun

So in the end, what happened here was

19

prompted by the officers, not by the Mendezes.

20

exception to that, of course, is the superseding cause

21

doctrine.

22

this entire case based on the superseding cause doctrine

23

and the fact that the proximate cause doctrine, we

24

submit, was not properly --

25

The only

And we believe that this Court can resolve

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go to that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

superseding cause document.

2

Alito that if a police officer unlawfully enters your

3

home, announces him or herself, shows you a badge, and

4

you pull out a gun and point it at him or her, that that

5

officer would not be liable for shooting you because,

6

presumably, that person, knowing that you're a police

7

officer, if they pull a gun on you, they are responsible

8

for the consequences, correct?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

10

Earlier you said to Justice

Correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So what's

11

the difference between that scenario and this one?

12

aren't -- why isn't Mr. Mendez's -- I don't think

13

there's a dispute that he was moving the gun not because

14

he heard the police officers, but he just wanted to get

15

it out of the way -- that there was no intent on his

16

part?

17

who points the gun at someone?

Why

What -- why isn't it just like the other person

18

MR. FELDMAN:

The difference is culpability.

19

The test that we have proposed for superseding cause

20

allows police officers to avoid liability if they can

21

show either that the intervening act was unforeseeable

22

or culpable.

23
24

If somebody -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
