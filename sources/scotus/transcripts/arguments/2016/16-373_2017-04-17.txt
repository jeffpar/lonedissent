Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities.

Mr. Goldstein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

We ask you to hold that American Pipe

12

tolling applies to both of the time limits set forth in

13

Section 13 of the Securities Act, which is reproduced in

14

a number of places, including the blue brief at the top

15

of page 3.

16

The other side has a tendency to invoke the

17

phrase "statute of repose," which isn't really

18

self-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there's

19

more going on in the statute than that, so I thought I

20

would just start with the text, and it begins, "no

21

action" -- and action is going to be the important noun

22

here.

23

"No action shall be maintained to enforce

24

any liability created under Section 11 unless

25

brought" -- and that's going to be the operative thing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

that has to happen -- "within one year after the

2

discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or

3

after such discovery should have been made by the

4

exercise of reasonable diligence."

5

The three-year period will follow in the next sentence,

6

but we can pause here for just a second because it

7

teaches a lot.

8

We know that American Pipe tolling applies

9

to this sentence, and therefore, we know a few things,

10

and it's conceded and everyone agrees.

11

The action is brought on --

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
little fast for me.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

You're -- you're just a

you.

Sorry.

I apologize.

Yes.

I don't want to interrupt

We know American toll -- American Pipe applies?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

To this sentence, that is,

18

if you do not -- if you file your action within one year

19

and class certification is denied, say, at year two, so

20

we haven't gotten to three years yet, if class

21

certification is denied two years afterwards, then

22

American Pipe tolling applies, and a class member can

23

opt out.

24
25

I apologize for moving through that so
quickly.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I understand.
And so what we know from

3

that, I think, is, as American Pipe tells us, that the

4

class action complaint commences the action on behalf of

5

each unnamed class member, and in the wording of Section

6

13, it brings the action on behalf of every unnamed

7

class member.

8
9
10

So the class complaint in our case, which
was filed within a year, brought the action on our
behalf.

11

Now, the second sentence says, and it's the

12

one at issue in the case before you, "in no event shall

13

any such action," referring to the one in the previous

14

sentence, "be brought to enforce a liability created

15

under Section 11 more than three years after the

16

security was bona fide offered to the public."

17

And so what happens, we believe, is that

18

just as the action was brought by the class action

19

complaint within one year, it was also brought within

20

necessarily three years.

21

brought on our behalf.

It was brought and it was

22

And we don't think that there's anything in

23

this sentence that is concerned with the application of

24

something like American Pipe tolling, which is an

25

interpretation of Rule 23.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If it doesn't apply here, we think, then

2

Rule 23 doesn't work, and it's going to generate all

3

manner of satellite litigation over what is the statute

4

of repose and what isn't.

5

pointless.

And it will all be entirely

6

As we understand --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the argument that you're

8

making is the one that you describe, I think -- or am I

9

correct, it's the one you say on page 38 of your brief

10

is the easiest way to decide this case?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

12

No, sir.

This is

the straightforward argument --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

This is -- well, I -- I

don't mean to confuse -JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- the argument relating

to the statute of repose.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It has nothing to do with

19

whether the class action was still pending at the time,

20

which is the debate over what the scope of the second

21

question presented is.

22

presented straightforwardly in IndyMac, and it is simply

23

the fact that under the text of Section 13, the class

24

action complaint brought the action on our behalf.

25

And the point that I was making is that, as I understand

This is the argument that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

the other side's rule, it amounts to amount -- a huge

2

amount of just pointless paperwork, because as the other

3

side understands how the statute should operate, and

4

that is, when the class action complaint is filed, then

5

what should happen is every class member ought to move

6

to intervene in the action or file their own individual

7

complaint then, to presage the possibility that,

8

hypothetically, some day later, they might opt out and

9

litigate on their behalf.

10

Not necessarily that they

will, but that they might.

11

And the entire point of American Pipe, in

12

interpreting Rule 23, is to stop that from happening.

Has it happened in the

Second Circuit?

It has happened in the

The other side does point to statistics and I've

20

The reason that the number of opt-out cases

21

is relatively small in comparison to the body of

22

securities litigation in the Second Circuit is twofold.

23

The first is there are very few recent Section 11 cases,

24

because Section 11 cases are only filed in declining

25

markets.

If the market is increasing and the price of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

securities is going up, then there's no point in

2

bringing Section 11 litigation at all, because it's

3

divined by -- you're -- you only get damages if the

4

price goes down.

5

And the second is, when the Second Circuit

6

announced this rule in the IndyMac case, this Court

7

immediately granted review.

8

brief by securities and civil procedure professors who

9

explain why it is that you haven't seen a ton of this

And so there is an amicus

10

yet, but if you announce a rule that tells lawyers like

11

me, you will only protect your client's interest if

12

there's -- you are -- there's a class action lawsuit

13

under something that is a statute of repose, or looks

14

like it, you will only protect your client's interest if

15

you file your own lawsuit or you move to intervene.

16

will do just that.

protections for defendants, but if the price hasn't gone

down, then you're not going to get damages under the

That's exactly the

(Laughter.)

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sir, it is the case that the

22

purpose of the statute of repose, we quite agree, is so

23

that the -- all of the possible asserted liability is

24

filed within the period in question.

be true under a variety of provisions of the securities

Alderson Reporting Company

And so that would

laws, under ERISA, a lot of things.
What American Pipe holds is that the class

3

action complaint does do that.

4

I think, that my friend doesn't say that they were in

5

any way unaware that we had this claim against them.

6

What they want us to do is to move to intervene in the

7

litigation, and what American Pipe and Crown, Cork &

8

Seal, and United Airlines all tell us is that we don't

9

want to foist upon the district judges, and retired

So it's very important,

10

district judges have filed an amicus brief, having to go

11

through, churn through this paperwork of

12

entirely unnecessary --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's clearly an argument

14

in your favor, practically, but I think the other side

15

has said that that second sentence is what's called a

16

statute of repose, whatever historically was the case.

17

In CTS, we made a big distinction, and said in such

18

statutes, you cannot toll them, et cetera.

19

And here we're not talking about the

20

action -- you may be right that -- that -- that when you

21

file a class action, if it's certified, that is the

22

action brought within the time, but here there's a

23

second action.

24
25

Your client leaves the first action.
what does he do after three years?

Alderson Reporting Company

And

I guess he puts a

would seem to be bringing an action.

4

because you seem to think that they haven't made

6

they haven't made good arguments.

13

They

They've done nothing

And in -- in that separate later action,

14

there might not just be a repetition, one, two, three,

15

of what's in the class action, but three new things,

16

four more sentences, maybe 20.

17
18

So years later, they could -- now, what do

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So --

Right, so the question is,

is this a separate and distinct action within the

2

is that it is not.

3

and, remember, in American Pipe, you had the exact same

4

structure.

And what American Pipe teaches

It is -- what American Pipe says --

You have a time limit of one year, and then

6

says, if it's not brought within four years, it shall be

7

forever barred.

8

And this is not a new action in any sense of the word.

9

Justice Breyer, if the plaintiff in the subsequent

11

securities, changes the nature of the lawsuit in any

12

way, but all we have done is opt out and

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

He just asks to amend the

16

he left, opted out a month before, and in that

17

amendment, he says -- this was 1,000 pages, the

18

offering, and on page 463, there are five new sentences

19

which have false facts, we want to put them in too.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

You're not allowed to do

understanding of the term "action"?

claims, as Justice Breyer points out, but it's a

different action.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I'll -- can I just say

2

first, I think we would win even if it was lawsuit,

3

because the lawsuit that matters, what American Pipe

4

teaches us in terms of putting the other side on notice

of the lawsuit, is the class complaint.

6

to disagree with that and if you were to say, look, if

7

you're going to say -- if we hold that it's a lawsuit,

you're going to lose, so it better not be a lawsuit.

The reason here is that what Congress was concerned

Well, the way I read it --

17

and I understand that Jones v. Bock does use the word in

18

a couple of different ways.

19

I think the bottom line is what you would

20

say, is that we try and be pragmatic about what it is

21

that Congress is attempting to accomplish when it's

22

talk -- using a phrase like "action" in a limitations

23

period.

24

that you have not only Section 13, but you have what is,

25

in effect, another Congressional enactment in Rule 23.

And so what I think you have to do is realize

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

What you tried to do in American Pipe is to reconcile

2

two different things that are going on.

3

In the wake of 1933 and 1934 and lots of

4

other statutes as well, when we modified and got away

5

from Equity Rule 38 and Equity Rule 30 -- and 48 and

6

created this class action system, is we were trying for

7

the administration of the courts to come up with a -- a

8

regime in which we would have only representative

9

litigation and not these individual suits.

10

And the other thing I would point you to is

11

you're not just dealing with Section 13 in securities

12

cases in particular.

13

that their rule has nothing to do with strict liability.

14

It's true about every statute of repose, which are

15

all -- if you can figure out what they are, they are all

16

over the place.

17

And, Justice Breyer, also remember

But we have the Private Securities

18

Litigation Reform Act as well.

19

several important things about class and represented

20

litigation in securities cases.

Number one, we want a

21

single representative plaintiff.

We don't want all of

22

these litigants.

23

absent class members will simply provide a notice if

24

they believe that they should be a named party.

25

not have them move to intervene, which is what we're

And it teaches, I think,

And number three, and this is really

15

going to have to be spun off into separate complaints,

at which point, I take it, given the formalism of the

17

other side's rule, all of these actions are now

18

untimely, and nobody has any idea why.

19
20

It's only there for pretrial purposes.

But it
It's

What is it that we're trying to do here?
What we know --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your -- your idea -- the

22

why is that -- is that your theory stems from Rule 23,

23

correct?

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That American Pipe is an

interpretation of Rule 23, yes, sir.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And your -- and your rule,

2

which is somewhat different from American Pipe, also

3

comes from Rule 23.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

alternative theories.

8

always on file.

9
10

I believe -Your principle.
Yes.

We have two

One, is that our action was

And I haven't discussed this.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.
This was the question of

11

Justice Alito, but American -- they are both

12

applications of Rule 23, yes, sir.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My concern is that you're

14

using Rule 23 to create, in effect, a legal right, or

15

override a legal right, and it's very clear that Rules

16

of Civil Procedure do not do that.

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is correct.

If we were

18

to be violating the Rules Enabling Act, of course, our

19

interpretation could not stand, and so I should talk

20

about that for a moment.

21

American Pipe confronts a quite similar

22

argument, of course, where the other side argued -- and

23

remember, American Pipe has the parallel structure; the

24

1-year period and the 4-year period saying it shall be

25

forever barred.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

And what this Court said in American Pipe,

2

and all of its Rules Enabling Act precedent is that,

3

look, obviously, there are rules of procedures that have

4

subsequent consequences.

5

you have no more right.

6

So you violate the rule, then

That's not what the Rules Enabling Act is

7

talking about.

8

when or where or how you file your lawsuit, which is why

9

the limitations period and, equally, a repose period is

10

It is not talking about a rule about

concerned with.

11

If I could just return to kind of the

12

question of whether or not it would have made sense for

13

Congress to have enacted this, and I -- I take the point

14

that maybe Congress -- if Congress enacts bad rules,

15

Congress enacts bad rules.

16

the statute, and I'm --

But there is ambiguity in

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

18

ambiguity in -- in no event?

19
20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Where -- where is the

Well, it's in no event,

what?

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

In no event.
But, sir, if I could jut

23

take you to the text, sir, because it's very rare that

24

Congress just writes "in no event."

25

is, in no event something.

Okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

And so what it says
In no event, shall

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

any such action be brought to enforce liability, and

2

then the 3-year period.

3

And so my point is what CTS says and what

4

other precedents have said about Statute of Repose, is

5

that they prohibit the application of equitable tolling

6

to extend the filing of the action.

7
8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what does the term

"such action" mean?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

"In no event, shall any such

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you think the

action."

action -- what is the definition of action --

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- in that statute?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

To take your first

18

question, which is "such action," we believe such action

19

is an action that is otherwise subject to the discovery

20

rule in the previous sentence.

21

perfect sense.

22

And that makes it make

What Congress was doing here is saying --

23

and this is true throughout, wherever you have these

24

two-tiered statutes of limitation or repose.

25

I've got this thing in the first sentence that's going

Alderson Reporting Company

It says

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

to say there's a discovery rule.

2

say, look, there's -- you can only have so much of this.

3

At some point, we're going to have to call a stop.

4

so it says you're going to have an action that's subject

5

to the discovery rule, but in no event shall such

6

action, one that could otherwise be extended

7

indefinitely.

8

But then I'm going to

And

Remember the first sentence, if you leave it

9

alone, the discovery rule can go 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

10

So in no event shall such action be brought more than

11

three years after it's offered to the public.

12

this sentence does is it cuts off the discovery rule.

13

But even if you were to disagree with me about that and

14

just say, no, the phrase "such action" just refers to

15

any Section 11 lawsuit, we believe it refers to a claim

16

under Section 11.

17

the first sentence --

18
19

And what

And what -- the reason I started with

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's enough that it's the

same claim --

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- as in the class action?

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is, it has to be the

23

entirety of the claim.

So to be just clear, you can't

24

just intone Section 11.

We are talking about the same

25

securities, the same misrepresentation --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

-- with respect to them.

Right.

3

What I have done when I have opted out is I have taken

4

control over an existing --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if -- if a plaintiff in

6

every single judicial district in the country had

7

brought exactly the same claim, those would all be the

8

same action, in your opinion?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No.

It's on behalf of that

10

person.

11

of a legal claim in the abstract, but what American Pipe

12

does in interpreting this idea, we'd have this new Rule

13

23 so that we have collective litigations, it says it

14

brings the action on behalf of the individual unnamed

15

class member.

16

Remember, it has to be not just the existence

So, to be clear, if one party brings it, you

17

know, just an individual lawsuit is brought, a claim,

18

that doesn't bring the -- the action on behalf of

19

CalPERS, of course.

20

of the class involved --

21

It has to be we have to be a member

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you think Congress had

22

all of this in mind when it wrote, "In no event shall

23

any such action," but it thought it was also clear it

24

didn't need to spell it out.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Oh, no, sir.

Alderson Reporting Company

The -- the

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

reason is this:

2

different.

3

which a representative action would be brought and then

4

people would opt in at the very end.

5

unresolved question --

6
7

Class action practice was a situation in

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

This was an

So what did Congress

have in mind when it wrote this?

8
9

Class action practice in 1934 was quite

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

What it had in mind

was letting the other side know that the claim had been

10

asserted against it, and that the class action does.

11

What it wanted was a party like ANZ or Lehman to know,

12

okay, here's the scope of your potential liability.

13

And what American Pipe says in terms is that

14

the classic complaint tells the other side everything it

15

needs to know, whether it's litigated on a collective

16

basis or instead on an individual basis.

17

says is we are not going to generate all of these

18

unnecessary motions to intervene, all of these

19

unnecessary individual lawsuits because we're going to

20

interpret Rule 23 and these Federal statutes together.

21

And so if I can just give you an illustration from your

22

own docket.

23

Supreme -- a hypothetical Supreme Court Rule 100.

24

you, as a docket management measure, are trying to

25

figure out how many cert petitions were going to be

And what it

Imagine that you were presented with a -- a

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

filed.

2

a cert petition within one month of the court of appeals

3

decision, you shall file a motion for leave to file a

4

cert petition.

And the rule said if you want to be able to file

5

Now, you're not promising to file a cert

6

petition.

7

a cert petition.

8

by making us act on this worthless motion.

9

think that that was a sensible thing to do because it

You know, you don't -- you don't have to file
All you're going to do is let us know
Nobody would

10

would accomplish nothing other than giving you, just

11

like this would only give the district courts,

12

additional work.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Goldstein, could I ask

14

you to speak to this question of your alternative

15

theories, because in your briefing, the non-tolling

16

theory, if I can call it that, took pride of place.

17

you haven't really spoken in those terms today.

18

am I to make of that?

19
20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Nothing.

But

So what

I just think the

-- we have two very good arguments.

21

The other argument that we make and -- and

22

I've also just tried to avoid the complication of what's

23

in and out of Question 2.

24

of what you intended when granting cert more than we

25

will.

You all will know the answer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

But I think that if you were thinking in

2

terms of tolling, then there has to be a gap in time in

3

which there is a distance between when the first action

4

ended and the second action began.

5

would need to toll something, to fill in the gap.

6

when you have a case like this one, when all we have

7

done is take control of our own action, it's very hard

8

to see why we need tolling at all.

9

That is why you
And

The other thing that's quite important is

10

that here we do have something concrete in law that we

11

are exercising, and that is our Rule 23 right to opt

12

out.

13

constitutional matter or not.

14

opt out and take control of our lawsuit, which is what

15

we did.

16

You don't have to wonder about this as a
We do have the right to

And so I don't understand how it is unless

17

Justice Kennedy's argument were to be played out and we

18

were to violate the Rule 23, to everyone's surprise

19

violates the rules enabling act in its core application

20

of our opt-out right, in that situation, all that has

21

happened is that we have different lawyers.

22

going to litigate this on our own.

23

required in terms of tolling, and that seems a very

24

straight way -- forward way of resolving this case --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We are

Nothing more is

It's not necessarily a

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

question of violating Rule 23.

2

create a new legal right.

3

It's using Rule 23 to

That's the difference.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, if we were to do that,

4

I quite agree, Justice Kennedy.

5

the proposition that if Rule 23 were to be -- violate a

6

substantive right of theirs or create a new substantive

7

right, it could not be interpreted that way.

8
9

My point is this:

I have never resisted

You have, we think, at

the very least, statutory language that can be read

10

either way.

11

to reconcile the two of them.

12

create a conflict between the opt-out right in Rule 23

13

or all of the policies --

14
15

And the way you deal with that problem is

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's no reason to

But you need tolling.

You

don't need it, perhaps, on your second theory.

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
If we take your second

18

theory, we have to read the words "be brought" to mean

19

something like deemed to have been brought when, but --

20

something like that -- but that won't solve the

21

practical problem you raised, because there will still

22

be cases in which class certification is denied after

23

three years, and all these practical problems will then

24

Why?

Why?

Because the phrase "tolling"

And if I could answer this question

and reserve the balance of my time.

11

Both United Airlines and the Chardon case

12

consider the question, does tolling mean suspend the

13

statute of limitations?

14

Airlines is a case in which the motion to intervene

15

didn't happen, not after class certification, but after

16

judgment at the end of the case.

17

you don't have to just use up the remainder of the

18

limitations period.

19

And it says no.

United

And the court said,

And Chardon is a case in which it was a 1983

20

class action, and the court said, no, no, no, no.

21

Tolling here doesn't mean just suspend the running of

22

the limitations period.

satisfied it and you're not going to be deemed untimely.

The tolling effect in the 1983 context is provided by

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Clement.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6
7

Thank you, counsel.

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

Section 13 of the Securities Act, in its

9

three-year time limit, plainly provides a statute of

10

repose.

11

two-tiered structure and emphatic, in-no-event language,

12

admits of no other conclusion.

13

This Court said as much in Lampf, and the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about the Clayton Act

14

that was at issue in American Pipe?

15

"in no event," but it did say -- what was the

16

language -- "forever barred."

17

commence within 4 years.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

That doesn't say

Forever barred

That's right, Justice

19

Ginsburg, but there's three reasons why the three-year

20

time limit in Section 13 is a statute of repose.

21

the no-event language that is emphatic.

22

two-tiered structure.

23

history.

One is

Two is the

And three is the legislative

24

Now, if you contrast that with the Clayton

25

Act at issue in American Pipe, there -- we can quibble

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

about whether the language was as emphatic, but

2

importantly, that language itself was -- was suspended

3

or tolled if there was a government enforcement action.

4

And what this Court held, at least as I read

5

American Pipe, is that we know that was a statute of

6

limitations because it was subject to tolling in at

7

least one circumstance.

8

And what this Court said in the Wallberger

9

case, of course, is, when you have a time limit that's

10

subject to tolling, that's a hint that it's a statute of

11

limitations because the defining feature of a statute of

12

repose that makes it different from a statute of

13

limitations is that it's not subject to tolling or

14

estoppel.

15

And since American Pipe was emphatically a

16

rule of tolling, the Court used the word "tolling rule,"

17

"toll," "tolling" at least a dozen times in the opinion.

18

That tolling rule simply does not apply to a statute of

19

repose like Section 13.

20

And I think --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How does one know?

When

22

one uses the language "forever barred," the other uses

23

"in no event," how do we know whether it's a statute of

24

repose?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think you have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

perhaps read beyond those particular words.

2

if you read beyond those words in the Clayton Act, you

3

get a textual clue that this is a limitations period,

4

because it says that it's subject to tolling if there is

5

a government prosecution.

6

And I think

If you continue to read in the context of

7

Section 13, you would find the two-tiered structure of

8

the statute, which this Court in Lampf said could only

9

be explained with the longer time period being a statute

10

of repose.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

But did you --

And then if you were --

please, just to finish the point.

14

If you were inclined to go further and look

15

at legislative history, then you would look at American

16

Pipe where this Court said the --

17

was silent.

18

supports the notion that the three-year time limit is a

19

statute of repose, because, as originally drafted, it

20

was a ten-year statute of repose.

21

specifically looked at it, specifically looked at the

22

two time periods, said that the second time period was

23

there to protect the defendants, and then shortened it

24

substantially in 1934.

25

legislative history

And here, the legislative history strongly

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And Congress

The two-tiered structure can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

be where the second tier just cuts off the discovery

2

rule.

3

two-tiered structure just as that, and say, yeah,

4

usually it's one year after discovery, but if you

5

discover it five years later, that's too much.

6

just cuts off the discovery rule.

7

thing that the two-tiered structure means perhaps.

8
9

So that would perfectly well explain the

MR. CLEMENT:

So it

And that's the only

I don't think that's right,

even if you were writing this opinion on a clean slate.

10

But, of course, you're not writing on a clean slate.

11

This Court looked at this specific provision, along with

12

some other provisions in the Exchange Act, in deciding

13

the Lampf case.

14

And it said that the three-year period was a

15

statute of repose, not that it just cut off the

16

discovery rule, a statute of repose.

17

because in Lampf itself, this Court considered an

18

equitable tolling argument.

19

equitable tolling argument precisely because the

20

three-year limit was a statute of repose.

21

And we know that

And it rejected the

Now, I suppose my friend on the other side

22

could quibble that there was multiple provisions at

23

issue in Lampf, but if you actually look at them,

24

there's Section 13, and then there were two provisions

25

from the 1934 Exchange Act.

And the -- the -- the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

language from the 1933 Act, Section 13 that's at issue

2

here, is the most emphatic.

3

two-tiered structure, but don't say in no event --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The other two have the

I suppose one question is,

5

what exactly do -- have we meant when we say a statute

6

of repose?

7

different from a statute of limitations.

8

what we were talking about in Lampf was the cutoff of

9

the discovery rule.

And we've certainly meant something
But I think

It -- it sort of didn't matter

10

whether your claim was going to accrue in the normal

11

way, consistent with the statute of limitations.

12

some point, we were going to cut it off.

13

At

And that's what we meant when we said

14

statute of repose, as opposed to some term that cut off

15

a variety of claims that just weren't before us and that

16

we weren't thinking about.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, if I

18

could beg to differ.

19

the very last section of the Lampf decision, it's where

20

it specifically rejects an equitable tolling argument on

21

the basis that this -- the second tier of the statute is

22

the statute of repose.

23

a discovery rule.

24
25

I think if you go back and read

So it wasn't just talking about

And, frankly, if you go back and think about
the context of Lampf, it was a pretty decent equitable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

tolling argument.

2

basically every federal court that looked at it thought

3

that the state law provided the statute of limitations.

4

And only very late in the game did this Court come

5

around and say, no, actually, it's a federal statute of

6

limitations, and it's much shorter than everybody

7

expected.

8

Because up until that point,

So in the cosmic scheme of equitable tolling

9

arguments, it seems like the parties that relied on the

10

applicable state statute of limitations had a darn good

11

equitable tolling argument, but this Court --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is --

-- would have none of it.
This is -- American Pipe,

15

at least as many interpret it, is not an equitable

16

tolling provision.

17
18
19

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, on at

least two occasions -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Doesn't -- it doesn't

20

differ -- we don't ask about good faith, and -- and it's

21

not tailored to the individual case.

22

start the class action, that's it.

23

critical thing that must be timely.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

It says when you
That's -- that's the

Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me

give you two responses to that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

First, on at least two occasions, when this

2

Court had a reason to label it one way or another, it --

3

this Court labeled the rule of American Pipe as the rule

4

of equitable tolling.

5

it.

6

So that's one way of answering

But the second thing is, with all due

7

respect, I think that your effort to say that this is --

8

that American Pipe's not equitable tolling is built on a

9

mistaken premise, because -- and it follows directly

10

from the argument my friend on the other side made,

11

which seems to flow from the premise that in order for

12

it to be equitable tolling, it has to take into account

13

all the individual circumstances of the case.

14

And as this Court said in Waldburger, in

15

talking about equitable tolling, two of the classic

16

situations for equitable tolling are categorical rules:

17

infancy and, essentially, lack of mental competence.

18

Those are two equitable rules for when a statute of

19

limitations are tolled, and they're equitable rules.

20

I think the equitable rule that this Court

21

established in American Pipe, and why it was right on

22

two occasions to refer to it as a rule of equitable

23

tolling is that, if you were a member of a timely

24

commenced class action, you have an equitable basis to

MR. CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay?

Sure.
So let me start with the

8

simplest one.

9

The court dismisses it saying, wrong venue.

This should

10

have been in California instead of New York.

Under your

11

theory, because a new complaint is filed in California,

12

that statute of limitations or that statute of repose

13

starts to run from the filing of the new complaint, not

14

the old one?

15
16

Okay?

A class action motion is filed.

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Justice

Sotomayor, for the --

There is a rule that

But you're saying that that rule would not

No, but as I understand the

sort of background understanding, so I could have it

if you're in the wrong venue, you can transfer the

You don't have to file a new

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You could -- you can ask

6

for it, but it's still within the judge's discretion

7

whether to transfer or dismiss and let you file anew.

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, well, and so I would

think that certainly if there were adverse consequences

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4
5

Well --- if the class is

ultimately denied.
MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I don't take that

6

position, Your Honor.

7

and I think we know this from American Pipe -- the

8

motion to intervene makes it an individual action on

9

that party's behalf if it survives --

10
11

I think a motion to intervene --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what happens when the

complaint is denied?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Those individual -All of those individual

MR. CLEMENT:

They're

Well, again, as long as -- I

18

think there is really a simple way to look at this that,

19

I think, answers all these questions.

20

You ask at the end, is the party seeking to

21

recover based on an action that was timely filed?

22

That's why this is a simple case, and it's why my friend

23

does need a rule of tolling or some kind of super strong

24

rule of relation --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's an opt-out?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

Why couldn't --

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's that?
-- could the judge

4

have -- or can a judge, who has a class action and tells

5

people, if you opt out, just file a motion to intervene?

6

Under your theory, why can't they do that?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Because the motion to

8

intervene, if I'm following -- it -- they can file the

9

motion to intervene.

10

Then the question is, is the

motion to intervene timely?

11

And so in American Pipe, for example, which

12

dealt with the statute of limitations, not a statute of

13

repose, there were those individual motions to

14

intervene.

15

did not say, all of those motions to intervene are

16

timely because the class action actually filed the

17

action for them.

18

Now, importantly, the Court in American Pipe

That's not what American Pipe held.

American Pipe held, all right, we're going

19

to examine the timeliness of those individual

20

intervention actions, and we are going to deem them

21

timely because we're going to apply a tolling rule.

22

they were tolled for the period that there was a class

individual claim.

That is the action to which you would apply
And, I'm sorry, 2011 is

And the case really is that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you're suggesting

we -- there's only one view of the word "action," and --

10

and the case stops there.

And perhaps that's right, but

11

let's say it's not right.

Let's just suppose that

12

"action" is a word that sometimes it's used one way, and

13

sometimes it's used another way, and we should look a

14

little bit as to the practical consequences of what

15

you're doing.

16

And it seems as though -- and tell me if you

17

think this is wrong -- that the consequences go

18

something like this:

19

any future suit like this, all large investors, the kind

20

of investors CalPERS -- CalPERS is not going to make

21

this mistake again.

22

protective action for itself, and then it can do what it

23

wants.

24
25

If we go your way in this case,

CalPERS is going to file a

Opt out, don't opt out, wait and see, whatever.
Well, small investors are not going to do

that.

They're not going to have the faintest idea that

they should be doing that.

2

kind of guaranteed to create make-work for district

3

courts to be essentially irrelevant for large investors,

4

and for small investors to lose their claims.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

So this is a rule that's

Well -- so, Justice Kagan, I

6

mean, you know, let me just put a pin in the idea that I

7

don't think there's any way to get to the textual result

8

that action just --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

MR. CLEMENT:

I know you think that -No.

And -- and I think there

11

are good textual reasons for that, but let's put a pin

12

in that.

13

To address sort of the -- the sort of parade of

14

horribles.

15

points I'd like to make about that.

16

I -- I can imagine that where you might think that if

17

this were IndyMac and we had no experience with the

Now, I'm a simple-minded person.

17

I would not get

So you'd

But if you got to the policy arguments, I

18

would really -- if I were, you know, trying to like

19

really twist the statute in a way that I think doesn't

20

comport with its basic test, I would need different

21

empirical data than we've gotten from the Second

22

Circuit.

23

And to get back to Justice Kagan's point --

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

And we do have -- we do

have two briefs, one by retired federal judges, one by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

law professors, tell us that inevitably you are going to

2

have people filing to intervene.

3

And in -- in that respect, assuming that

4

you're right, so that the people who don't intervene

5

within the 3-year period are out, does lead counsel have

6

an obligation to inform everyone in the class, if you

7

don't file a separate action of your own or intervene in

8

this one, you are going to be out?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

So, two things, Justice

10

Ginsburg.

11

is to simply say I don't think lead counsel has that

12

obligation.

13

reference to the two briefs you've mentioned, it's worth

14

going back to the IndyMac docket and looking at the

15

amicus briefs filed there, because those same two amicus

16

briefs were filed -- some law professors, some retired

17

judges.

18

And it turns out it's absolutely not borne out by the

19

experience in the Second Circuit.

20

I'll answer your final question first, which

But let me also, just in -- in specific

And they made the same prediction back then.

Now, why is that?

Well, as Justice Kagan

21

pointed out, the reason that lots of small investors

22

don't file their own intervention actions or separate

23

actions, is because it's just -- you know, for them it's

24

a class action or nothing.

25

they have to essentially rely on the class action

And -- and so, you know,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1
2

device.
The reason that the institutional investors

3

haven't done it is because they're not that worried

4

about timeliness in lots of cases, though there are some

5

cases where they are worried about either the quality of

6

the class counsel or some other counsel has gotten to

7

them and convinced them that they're going to do better

8

if they file alone -- they file alone --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You mean they're not

10

worried about timeliness because they're relying on the

11

class action?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

And if they stay in

13

the class action, there's no timeliness problem.

14

get to recover.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

They

But just to -And so all -- all our rule

17

does is make somebody who wants to go it alone, they

18

have to make that decision within 3 years.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's --

It puts tremendous pressure

20

on the opt-out right, right?

21

that the opt-out right is a very important part of class

22

actions; it's what saves them from a due process

23

problem, that people actually do get to say, I don't

24

want any part of this.

25

We're used to thinking

And you're saying they only get to say that

4

that.

5

within that month or 6 months that these lawyers are not

7

it for yourself.

And, you know, if -- if you haven't decided

sort of there's a couple of points I'd want to say about

that.

14

investors --

15

I mean, even if you don't opt out, you haven't

You have the right to object to the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All power to you, but, you

16

know, a lot of those settlement hearings are awfully

17

tough.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, they're tough, I

19

suppose, because everybody is all in the same team.

20

if we create an incentive where the CalPERS of the world

21

are actually going in there and actually fighting for a

22

better settlement for the whole class, I mean, that's a

23

world where actually the small, individual investor is

24

going to benefit.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Rule 23 did not want

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

that to happen.

2

out rather than to be confined in the suit for the

3

entire pendency of the suit and then to start fighting

4

the outcome at the -- at the last moment.

5

Rule 23 wanted to allow people to opt

Well, two points, Justice

Kagan.

9

the lead plaintiff, precisely on the theory that it's

10

going to rise -- that all boats will rise with the --

11

with the institutional investor.

12

in Rule 23, I think in light of the PSLRA, this is

13

actually a better result.

First of all, whatever Rule 23 wanted, the PSLRA

14

They actually have preferences for them as

So whatever happened

But as to the opt-out right, the opt-out

right gives you a right not to be bound by a judgment

that you had no business in procuring.

guarantee that you're going to have a viable individual

18

action to opt into.

19

It doesn't

Now, there still may be reasons why an

20

individual investor or an institutional investor wants

21

to opt out.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

right.

24

your own claim.

25

It's not much of an opt-out

Go ahead, opt out, but -- but you can't bring

MR. CLEMENT:

But -- but look at what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

happened with the Petitioners in this case.

2

they opted out.

3

their individual action before class certification, so

4

they, like, pre-opted out.

I mean,

I used air quotes because they filed

5

But they opted out, but they still preserved

6

10b-5 claims, which have a longer statute of repose, and

7

they proposed -- they -- they pursued some other claims.

8

Other plaintiffs could pursue State law claims.

9

just -- if -- if you opt out of a claim that's subject

So it

10

to a 3-year statute of repose and you haven't brought an

11

individual action before then, then you do not have a

12

timely action subject to that statute of repose.

13

that's the purpose of a statute of repose.

14

But

And from the perspective of a defendant, if

15

you are facing just a class action, you know that --

16

it -- it -- and the time of repose passes, then you know

17

you're going to be able to get essentially global legal

18

peace if you settle the class action.

19

If, on the other hand, you face that big

20

class action and then two or three of the big

21

institutional investors opt out and file their own

22

individual actions, then you're going to know that you

23

can't get global legal peace in the class action; you're

24

going to have to pay sort of a hold-out premium to those

25

institutional investors.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's why, you

I -- I would like you to

13

go back to the question I asked, because one of the

14

purposes of the Federal rules is that so litigants

15

should know what they're facing.

16

of notices that have to be sent for class actions, and

17

yet you tell me that there's no obligation of lead

18

counsel, or the court, I assume, when the 3 years -- the

19

time is running, to tell everyone in the class, now

20

either you bring an individual action or intervene in

21

this one, otherwise, you'll never get a penny.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

And there's all kinds

I -- I don't think there is

23

that obligation, Justice Ginsburg.

24

on the theory of the class action, which is that you're

25

only going to have a class action if the class

I think it's based

2

for the entire class.

5

protections are built in for the class.

emphasis that nothing in the rule that we are proposing

I think that's where the

13

of repose.

If they do, then my clients don't have a statute

14

But if in a case like this, in 2011, even

15

before class certification decision is being made, they

16

decide you know what?

17

we file our own action in the Northern District of

18

California.

19

We're going to be better off if

It's a bit rich for them to say okay, even

20

though we've decided to file our own action for our own

21

reasons because we think we're going to be better off,

22

we still get the benefit of the timeliness of the class

23

action that we're essentially pre-opting out of.

24

and magically, they think they get the benefit of that,

25

without even applying tolling or some kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

And --

relation-back doctrine.

2

Now, I don't think that works on the text of

3

the statute.

4

what question presented 1 has and question presented 2

5

is, but it's worth remembering that even if you somehow

6

think you can maybe interpret Section 13 to encompass

7

this theory, I mean, there are other cases.

9

I don't want to get into a debate about

This case had -- this Court had four
petitions in front of it.

None of the other three

10

petitions invoked this issue in the context of Section

of them was an implied statute of repose provision.

grant the question that I thought you granted this case

But we know that's not the reason,

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

11

think that both Waldburger and the text of Section 13

12

tell you what repose defendant gets.

It gets no new

13

actions.

If an action is

14

filed before the time deadline, then, of course, it's

15

going to be subject to liability under that action, even

16

if it takes another couple of years for that to run its

17

course and be resolved.

18

additional liability under actions that are filed after

19

the period of the statute of repose. And that seems like

20

a very reasonable compromise --

21

That's the repose it gets.

But you are not subject to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but they're

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

mean, it -- it requires, perhaps, more management and

14

scrutiny by the district judges that is possible, but,

15

you know, theoretically, if a big chunk of the class is

16

out, you're not going to pay twice for that, right?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

But typically, and

18

especially in securities class action, it's not a big

19

chunk that's out.

20

investors who are able to use the fact that they've

21

opted out for additional leverage to get a better

22

settlement than they would get in the class.

23

works against the principles of Rule 23 and the PLSRA,

24

but there's nothing that my clients can do to stop it if

25

those individual actions are filed in a timely fashion.

It's a handful of institutional

Now, that

But when those individual actions, new

2

actions are filed after three years has passed, I would

3

respectfully suggest that that fully implicates the

4

policies behind statutes of repose generally and the

5

text of this statute.

6

And then I do think that gives you a very

7

easy way to essentially decide this case, which is to

8

just ask the question:

Is the action that they are

10

filed within 3 years of the public offering of the

11

securities at issue here.

12

And it was most certainly not.

It was filed

13

in the Northern District of California in 2011, more

14

than 3 years after the securities were issued.

15

only way they can make that action timely is to point to

16

something else that was timely filed.

17

And the

Now, at the time that they opted out because

the class wasn't even certified, that action over in

benefit from some super tolling rule or some super

23

you don't get to use to impose new liability in the face

of a statute of repose.

25

So maybe they can get the

Waldburger said the defining feature of a statute of

3

repose is they're not subject to tolling or estoppel.

4

It didn't use equitable tolling as a modifier.

5

course, as we've discussed, or as was discussed, if this

6

rule is something other than a rule of equitable tolling
