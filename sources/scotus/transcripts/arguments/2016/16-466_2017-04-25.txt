Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The California Supreme Court ruled that

13

hundreds of plaintiffs who were not prescribed a drug in

14

California, who did not take it in California, who

15

lacked any injury in California, and who had no other

16

connection to California could sue in California.

17

The court reasoned there was a sliding scale

18

whereby the defendant's other conduct with other

19

Californians could establish specific jurisdiction.

20

Those concepts have some footing in the law, but that

21

footing is limited to general jurisdiction, which is

22

lacking here, and this Court has never permitted

23

specific jurisdiction in such circumstances, which is

24

presumably why Respondents don't bother defending the

25

California Supreme Court.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

Instead, they mint a whole new test, never

2

before seen by any court whereby an ad hoc

3

reasonableness inquiry with any number of undetermined

4

balancing factors will create jurisdiction.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You've conceded that

6

there's fair play and substantial justice.

7

not quite, perhaps, takes away the due process argument,

8

which basically has to be the argument that you're

9

making here.

10

MR. KATYAL:

That almost,

Justice Kennedy, I don't think

11

that's actually what we conceded.

12

that the reasonability -- reasonableness inquiry is with

13

respect to the third kind of safety valve factor.

14

didn't make the argument with respect to the third

15

prong, but we absolutely did make the argument that

16

jurisdiction here was unreasonable below.

17

What we did say is

We

At pages 4 and 18 in the court of -- in the

18

California Supreme Court brief, we made very clear.

19

said it would, quote, "Offend basic notions of

20

federalism and fairness" at page 4.

21

said, "Instead of achieving jurisdictional fairness,

22

their rule would distribute their burden of defending

23

mass torts in a lopsided way."

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

damages nationwide, or even worldwide, and even

10

So you're not

I mean, it's not the law in any court -- any

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do you deal -- so

you're saying that pendent jurisdiction for claims that,

18

in some way, are connected violates due process?

MR. KATYAL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. KATYAL:

is no -- there is no pendent jurisdiction for State

claims as it exists right now.

relevant locus of analysis, Justice Sotomayor --

There

-- is always -Let's put it aside.

But I'm just saying that that

has been the law, and always is --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But your position right

13

now is that in no suit will one court, State court, ever

14

be able to hear the entire controversy between a

15

plaintiff and a defendant.

16

MR. KATYAL:

Oh, definitely not.

Heavens be

17

that is not our position at all, Justice Sotomayor.

18

for example, every place in which there was general

19

jurisdiction, you can have that court hear it --

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So,

Only when that's general

jurisdiction.

MR. KATYAL:

No, not -- again, that's one

place.

10

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

It may be that that's

11

enough for specific jurisdiction, depending on what the

12

underlying claim is.

13

Exactly, Justice Ginsburg.

The question here is can they glom on to the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's efficient about

having piecemeal litigations across the country?

18

MR. KATYAL:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -For years we've been

20

approving pendent jurisdiction, or at least not taking

21

any case that disturbed it, and there are cases in which

22

we've just assumed it.

23

And what's the reasonableness there?

24

MR. KATYAL:

25

What's the efficiency there?

So -- so first of all, Justice

Sotomayor, I disagree with the premise.

Alderson Reporting Company

I don't know

this Court has ever accepted the idea of pendant

2

jurisdiction of State court claims that are -- are

without causality.

the causality principle.

in Goodyear and Daimler, I think, make this very clear.

7

Indeed, our brief, at pages 19 to

And your most reason decisions

Now, with respect to the reasonability --

8

the efficiency, I think the first thing to say is their

9

rule doesn't create any efficiency at all.

That is,

10

just take a look at the facts of this case.

11

the California Supreme Court ruled, you already -- you

12

still have action going on in New York, coordinated

13

actions, you have law of MDL in New Jersey, and you have

14

lawsuits in Delaware.

15

before you had lawsuits in Arizona, Illinois, Hawaii --

16

Even after

Petition Appendix page 72 says

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if this suit went

17

forward just with the California plaintiffs and

18

Bristol-Myers did not prevail, would there be issue

19

preclusion in other States, assuming that judgment was

20

final?

21

MR. KATYAL:

I don't think so.

And -- and

22

our brief -- our reply brief does -- you know, cites a

23

bunch of, you know, literature on this that, basically,

24

because there's no much divergence in the underlying

25

causes of action, collateral estoppel just doesn't work.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if they all -- if

2

they -- if they all allege the same basic flaw in the

3

drug, the -- the drug was defective but cost, and that's

4

determined in suit number 1, I take it that would be

5

issue preclusion.

6

MR. KATYAL:

But the -- the problem is there

7

are so many different substantive standards as a matter

8

of actual reality as opposed to, you know, kind of a

9

theory about deceptive marketing or something.

10
11

They do

differ so much from State to State.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let's -- let's

12

assume that New York and California are basically the

13

same, the facts are basically the same.

14

California judgment that's valid, I assume, the

15

plaintiff is going to argue for issue preclusion.

16

it -- it seems to me that actually helps you because --

17

because it shows that this rule that you're proposing is

18

not so inefficient as the Respondent would say.

19

MR. KATYAL:

If there's a

And

Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.

20

There's no -- there's no -- you know, we can, of course,

21

waive -- waive that and -- and seek collateral estoppel.

22

But to go back to --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Katyal, could we go back

24

to a form of Justice Kennedy's first question, which is,

25

just could you explain what defendant's interests are at

stake here?

2

looked to fairness for the defendant when we make the

3

due process inquiry.

4

given that there is another suit that's going to be

5

going forward in California, and what Mr. Goldstein

6

wants is just for additional claims of the exact same

7

kind to be joined to that suit?

8

In other words, you know, usually we've

So what is the unfairness here,

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

So there's three

9

values this Court's isolated:

Federalism,

10

predictability, and fairness.

The fact that we --

11
12
13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So could we just start with

the fairness?
MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

So the fairness

15

to walk through the lifecycle of --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. KATYAL:

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. KATYAL:

You've timed it.

-- but -- I have.

And -- but our view is to

20

affirm Bristol-Myers in -- to affirm the judgment below

21

or to accept his theory is going to be -- you know, be

22

complex, it's going to be inefficient and unfair, and do

23

something this Court has never blessed before internally

24

that Bristol-Myers didn't open itself up to.

25

So the first thing that would happen in this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

lawsuit is a determination of choice of laws he

2

acknowledges.

3

from 33 States.

4

to first figure that out.

There are 575 out-of-State plaintiffs
So the California court's going to have

5

Second, it's then going to have to apply

6

California procedure to all of these cases, which is

7

markedly different than the procedure in the places in

8

which Bristol-Myers sold the drugs as to which caused

9

the underlying injury.

10

So, for example, California has different

11

rules about summary judgment.

12

summary judgment, very easy to go to trial.

13

also -- they don't have a Daubert rule, so they have

14

very lenient permissive testimony with respect to

15

experts.

16

when they sold, for example, a drug in Ohio to an Ohio

17

plaintiff.

18

It's really hard to get
It's

That isn't something Bristol-Myers bought into

Then you get to the trial.

And this is, I

19

think, the most important part, because their reply --

20

because their brief points it out as, oh, this is

21

efficient and it's coordinating all of these actions.

22

Take a look at Joint Appendix page 74, which is their

23

jury trial demand.

24

25

those jury trials, the court is going to have to

14

MR. KATYAL:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, they do.
The question is what's

16

the unfairness of coordinating the common questions in

17

one place when there is so much overlap in the essence

18

of the claim, which is false marketing?

19

MR. KATYAL:

So -- so, Justice Sotomayor,

20

first of all, I don't think that they would be

coordinated.

22

by trial.

23

the extent you wanted coordination, the Federal system,

24

obviously, has a way to do that from the perspective

accepted, and this Court's always said, one of the goals

like the Plack brief points out, look, if you are enter

Bristol-Myers doesn't disagree.

Predictability is really

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you already know because

this is a nationwide marketing that you do, nationwide

drug, you already know that you're subject to

11

jurisdiction in any of the 50 States and have to be

12

prepared to confront jurisdiction in any of the 50

13

States.

14

MR. KATYAL:

But -- but Justice Kagan,

15

critically, we know that we confronted with respect to

16

each individual State's procedure and substance.

17

don't accept the idea that plaintiffs can play by least

18

common denominator rules and file Ohio claims in

19

California or Alaska.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We

Well, I guess what I'm

21

saying is that I -- the unfairness aspect of this is

22

what I really want to drive at, because predictability

23

just honestly doesn't seem like what's at issue here

24

given that you know it's perfectly predictable to have

25

litigation in any of the 50 States.

20

does not want more suits than necessary to happen in

21

California?

22

And I -- I'm assuming that

So why is it that a person would choose to

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I suppose one thing, the

plaintiffs only have one thing to think about, which is

24

what's kind of jurisdictionally advantageous for them,

25

either procedurally or substantively.

a concern in this area about forum shopping.

9

We do

But I think

10

that kind of underlying this is a notion about

11

predictability and what their rule does, fairness, and

12

then federalism, which I'd like to get to, because this

13

Court's identified it, starting in World-Wide

14

Volkswagen, as a critical thing.

15

And the idea that the Ohio plaintiffs -- or

16

that the State of Ohio can't adjudicate these cases

because they're grabbed by California is something,

18

again, that this Court hasn't --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7

10

Thank you, counsel.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. KOVNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court in Goodyear and Daimler rejected

11

approaches to general jurisdiction that would allow

12

plaintiff in one State to sue a national company for

13

product liability in all of the other 49 States, calling

14

those approaches exorbitant and unacceptably grasping.

15

The California Supreme Court misunderstood this Court's

16

decisions when it allowed that same result under the

17

label of specific jurisdiction.

18

As this Court explained in Goodyear,

19

specific jurisdiction lets a State exercise authority

20

over activity within its borders, which it has a strong

21

interest in controlling.

22

interest in exercising authority over out-of-State

23

defendants for entirely out-of-State conduct.

24
25

But a State lacks a comparable

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if this were -- if

this were a case where the nonresident plaintiffs were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

suing Bristol-Myer in California, then everything you

2

say follows.

3

California could assert jurisdiction against

4

Bristol-Myers on behalf of out-of State plaintiffs.

5

It's -- essential to this case is that there be a case

6

of Californians against Bristol-Myers, and this is

7

tagged on to it.

8
9

But that's -- no one is urging that

MS. KOVNER:

That's right, Your Honor.

So I

agree that the question here is whether the fact that

10

the out-of State plaintiffs have joined their claims in

11

a single lawsuit with California plaintiffs makes a

12

difference.

13

looked at the interest that the Court has considered in

14

its specific and its general jurisdiction decisions.

15

Because I don't think that California has a greater

16

interest in exercising control over the conduct of

17

out-of-State defendants in another State just because

18

those claims have been joined with in-State plaintiffs.

19

And I don't think that it does, if you

I think the principal reason that

20

respondents suggest that California does have that

21

interest is an efficiency interest.

22

defined general jurisdiction in a way that allows

23

plaintiffs to bring their suit together in a single

24

forum for efficiency purposes --

We think generally, there will be, because if the

14

conduct --

Assume a foreign corporation.

Under

your theory, that foreign corporation might be sued in

11

the particular State in which an injury occurred.

12

13

means that in that situation, there's no place for

14

plaintiffs to come together and sue that person;

MS. KOVNER:

Yes, and continuing through

22

McIntyre, this Court has made clear that specific

jurisdiction needs to be defined with -- with an eye to

24

the view that there are 50 different States, and that

25

other States are also going to have an interest in

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. KOVNER:

I think there are two States

10

that have a very strong interest, at least two States

11

that have a very strong interest in providing a forum

12

for the conduct at issue here.

13

plaintiffs were injured, and States where the defendants

14

are at home, because States have an interest in

regulating the conduct of their --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's States where the

So on the plaintiff's side,

17

that seems a pretty attenuated interest, if -- because

18

usually when we say that the State has an interest, it's

19

in protecting their own citizens and providing their own

20

citizens with a forum.

21

he doesn't want that protection, he wants to go

22

someplace else.

23

to say that the State has a very strong interest in

24

protecting its own citizen that doesn't want to be

25

there.

But here the citizen has decided

It seems, you know, a little bit weak

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. KOVNER:

I don't think so at all.

I

think, Your Honor, that the State has a strong interest

borders, and defining what's fair with respect to how

5

that conduct is adjudicated.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's -And it's also true, it

10

MS. KOVNER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's right, Your Honor.
Which doesn't -- that's

12

why due process is the same for Federal and State, but

13

there's a different set of criteria to which you apply

it.

nationwide, the Federal government isn't.

The States are limited in their jurisdiction to

against expanding specific jurisdiction to allow States

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

different in the following sense --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. KOVNER:

Isn't that what you write?

It's different in the sense

4

that the sovereign is different, and so the kind of

5

contexts that you're talking about in the Fifth

6

Amendment are contexts with the national sovereign.

7

in that case, you would look to, does this company have

8

the relevant minimum context to make it fair for the

9

national sovereign --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

So it's context with the

11

United States as opposed to an individual State.

12

we -- if it's a Federal statute, then that -- and not

13

hemmed in by State boundaries, it can create a

14

nationwide claim.

That's right, Your Honor, and

provisions in which Congress has exercised that kind of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14
15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

16

We believe that four facts make -- are

17

sufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction

18

in this case.

19

them.

20

If I could just very briefly summarize

The first is that the defendant engaged in

21

the systematic and continuous exploitation of this

22

market, California, the forum, with respect to the

23

matter that gave rise to the claim, so the sale of

24

Plavix. The second is the case was decided below, and

25

certiorari was granted on the understanding that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

litigating here would not place a significant additional

2

burden on BMS, it wouldn't be unfair because the claims

3

arise not from parallel activity, but the same activity

4

by BMS.

5

operative facts.

It's the same legal theory and the same

6

The third is that there is a significant

7

governmental interest that is implicated by this case in

8

that the courts are able to bring together a large

9

volume of litigation that would otherwise be atomized

10

across the States.

11

And the fourth is that there is what --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

The States or the State?
That would be atomized

across the States.

15

My point is that, you know, we have a large

16

number of cases about Plavix, and what's happening here

17

for the benefit of the States, this is discussed in

18

Keeton, is to bring the cases together so that the

19

multistate judicial process can operate more

20

efficiently.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's really not

22

possible.

23

Plavix plaintiffs together in one forum.

24

of doing that because plaintiffs have many choices.

25

so some individual plaintiffs chose to hook up with the

And it would be ideal if we could get all the

Alderson Reporting Company

We have no way
And

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

California, but there's lots of -- there's one footnote

2

that says all the cases, some are multidistrict cases,

3

some are multiple plaintiff cases.

4

The -- so whatever we rule in -- in this

5

case, there's still going to be a lot of -- a lot of

6

Plavix litigation spread around the United States.

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah, Justice Ginsburg, if I

8

can come back that -- in one second, I -- I think it's a

9

fair point.

10

is better with respect to that --

11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah, exactly right.

That's

why I just --

15
16

And could we have the

fourth of -- I interrupted --

13
14

I want to give you my sense of why our rule

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I interrupted you at

first --

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, no -But what was the fourth?
Right.

The fourth is that

20

this case has what Justice Breyer, in Nicastro, talked

21

about as a special feature, and that's McKesson.

22

we have here is Bristol-Myers' decision to contract with

23

a California company to distribute this drug nationally.

24

McKesson distributed 700,000 pills of Plavix outside

25

California a week, and we think that's quite significant

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

for multiple reasons.

2

that involves California in the nationwide distribution.

3

In addition --

4
5

It is a choice by BMS, a contact

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But not necessarily to all

the plaintiffs here.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

A -- a couple things

7

about that.

8

to a particular person, because what happens is you're

9

admitted to a hospital, you're given Plavix, you then go

It is impossible to trace a particular pill

10

see your doctor who gives you a sample, and then

11

prescribes it to you, and then you may be in an assisted

12

living facility.

13

particularly to McKesson.

14

It's not possible for us to track

My point is simply is that they made a

15

choice to contract with a major national distributor of

16

the drug located in California, and that has a

17

significant point for California-specific interests in

18

this litigation.

19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I -- I

think Justice Ginsburg's question is still pending.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22

And, Justice Ginsburg, you're quite right

Excellent.

Thank you.

23

that we don't have a perfect solution, but what we can

24

do is aid the States' judicial systems by allowing the

25

litigation to be centralized.

You just compare our rule

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

with theirs.

2

because in multi-defendant mass tort actions, you don't

3

have a common general jurisdiction, is that there's

4

going to be a bunch of litigation in Ohio and Nevada and

5

Texas and --

6

The upshot of their rule, precisely

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's a very

7

patronizing view of federalism.

8

Ohio, oh, don't worry, Ohio, we'll take care of you.

9

That's not -- that's -- that's not the idea of the

10

Federal system.

11

limited.

12

California will tell

The Federal system says that States are

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sir, let me just analogize

13

this case to Keeton, if I might, because there you have

14

a very similar situation.

15

Hampshire State courts -- or a New Hampshire court, and

16

it is adjudicating a claim --

And that is, you have the New

17

18

Hampshire to that plaintiff.

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21
22

There was an injury in New

That's -And that's not present

here.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is absolutely correct.

23

But what the Court said was that that wasn't the special

24

feature of it, and that was that that claim would

25

otherwise be litigated in the 50 States, and that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

States had an interest in centralizing it.

2
3

If I could just make the final point about
McKesson --

4
5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's peculiar to -- to

libel claims.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and

13

that -- that's why, I mean, you've cited Keeton twice,

14

it's cited innumerable times in your brief.

15

completely sui generis in that respect.

16

It is

I -- it involved the single publication

17

rule, and what that is, it says, this is a restatement,

18

as to any single publication, only one action for

19

damages can be maintained.

judgment for or against the plaintiff upon the merits of

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

If I could just give

you my thoughts about that.
It has never been cited subsequently by --

in that sense.

7

exists in most, not all, States, remember Keeton quite

8

clearly says it doesn't exist in every State, but all of

9

the claims are allowed in New Hampshire, but it still

And though the single publication rule

10

has to be constitutional, is my point.

11

States can make whatever decisions they like, but Keeton

12

makes quite clear that each publication is a separate

13

libel, each arises under each individual State's laws.

14

And that is, the

My general point is that there are two

15

federalism interests here.

16

California doesn't have an interest in adjudicating

17

Ohio's claim, and it is territorially limited.

18

I quite take the point that

On the other hand, the Court has recognized

19

in cases like Keeton that the States do have an interest

20

in trying to make this simpler, not more complicated.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I would point out that Mr. Katyal and

They just want it to be in

I don't understand how any of their

arguments map onto the concession that a New Jersey

That State is adjudicating a claim from another

14

If I could just make the final --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

The obvious is that this is

your home State.

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

It isn't, though.
But let's imagine it's a

19

home or whatever, and you say that a business is in that

20

State.

21

22

Make things here, do business here, incorporate here.

23

You make it -- you -- you do business here, you
I don't care if you're home or not.

Now, you can be sued in any State still,

24

under special jurisdiction, where you cause harm, but

25

you can't be sued in States where you didn't.

Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

that, I think, is what -- I think that's what they're

2

saying is the special federalism interest of either the

3

home State or the State where they did the

4

manufacturing, or the State where they, you know,

5

whatever the other one is where you count as a home

6

State.

That does sound special.

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, all I can say is that

8

in New -- the example of New Jersey and specific

9

jurisdiction, they would be adjudicating the claim of

10

somebody who was harmed in Ohio, even though it's not

11

their home.

12

But I did really want to focus on the -- the

13

special interest that California has here because of the

14

role of McKesson.

15

You know, the Court is involved in --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, Mr. Goldstein,

16

that's a very fact-specific argument.

17

I thought, to decide the legal question whether we have

18

some sort of causation requirement or permit this

19

sliding scale business that California engages in, as a

20

legal matter.

21

move to this all-things-considered approach, are we

22

collapsing what had been previously two separate due

23

process inquiries, one was purposeful availment, and the

24

other was fundamental fairness.

25

really, it all just boils down to fundamental fairness.

And we took this,

And on that, I just wonder if -- if we

And as Judge Silverman said, a length of the

chancellor's foot.

3

So I'm just wondering what happens

4

doctrinally to the first test?

5

And if it doesn't, does that suggest some problem

6

doctrinally, formally, with your position?

7
8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Does it have any bite?

If I could give you a

narrower answer and then a bigger picture answer.

9

The -- the narrow answer is that our view of

10

the relatedness inquiry that is articulated in

11

International Shoe does require that they engage in what

12

Keeton and International Shoe refer to as the continuous

13

and systematic exploitation of the market.

14

contact.

15

same claim on the same operative facts.

That's a

And the relationship has to be that it is the

16

There's no general --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's like saying,

18

Mr. Goldstein, that the claim relates to another claim

19

that relates to contacts with the forum.

20

guess I'm -- I'm missing what the relationship is

21

between an Ohio plaintiff's claim and the defendant's

22

contacts with the forum that doesn't go through another

23

claim.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I mean, I

Well, here is how we

understand that it would operate, and that is, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

California court is providing a forum to adjudicate a

2

claim about the lawfulness of BMS's design and

3

manufacturing and distribution of this drug Plavix.

4

That is activity that didn't occur in California.

5

That is activity that they quite clearly say happened in

6

New Jersey.

7

Okay?

So the California court is going to make an

8

adjudication of that.

9

California court has the unquestioned power to determine

10

under a legal standard that that was lawful and a set of

11

facts, it's not limited --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Our point is simply that when the

No, I understand that that's

13

your point.

14

our personal jurisdiction cases require is somebody to

15

state in -- state something like this:

16

claim relates to or arises out of the defendant's

17

contacts with the forum State.

18

contacts with California.

19

me how an Ohio plaintiff's claim arises out of or

20

relates to the defendant's contacts with California.

21

Just it -- it does because why?

22

But I guess what I've always thought that

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The plaintiff's

So here, Bristol-Myers'

And I just want you to tell

It does because the relevant

23

contact is the nationwide activity.

24

correct, by the way, because just take a company that is

25

trying to exploit -- it manufactures something in

Alderson Reporting Company

That has to be

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

New Jersey, hands it off to a distributor, knowing that

2

the distributor will exploit the California market.

3

The only thing the defendant does is do

4

something in New Jersey, right?

5

California that gives rise to specific jurisdiction.

6

The California court's jurisdiction attaches to the

7

activity outside.

8
9

It's not activity in

It's the same conduct.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It is not --

Let me see if I understand

that, because you're saying -- usually we say how does

10

the claim relate to the contacts in a particular State,

11

say in California.

12

really.

13

nationwide contacts, and the plaintiff's claim relates

14

to those nationwide contacts.

15
16
17

Here we can't answer that question,

So we say now the contacts in California are

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
nationwide contacts.

It arises from those same

But I have a second answer --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Those nationwide contacts

18

being a nationwide advertising campaign, a nationwide

19

marketing campaign, and so forth.

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

Exactly.

But I have

21

a second answer, and that is, there is a critical

22

additional contact here that gives rise to a very

23

significant interest of California.

24
25

And understanding, Justice Gorsuch, there's
a big picture question about the standard, but then we

about simply saying here's the correct test, reverse,

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, you're going to have

10

to say something about McKesson is all I'm saying.

11

The -- the other side really wants to put it entirely to

12

the side.

13

questions here about the interests of California.

14

just don't think you can get rid of BMS's most

significant contacts with California and say that it's

irrelevant here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could one of these

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The Plavix claim could

43
1

have -- it depends on who we're talking about, but yes,

2

there could have been a class action.

3

the necessary implication.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

where could it be brought?

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And I take the --

And where -- if -- if so,

The -- it could be

7

brought -- depending on whether you think McKesson plays

8

a significant role, it would have been brought, I think,

9

in California is the place where the class action would

10

have been brought.

11

important thing for you to realize about all of this

think, how the States do work together.

14

I will -- can I just bracket one

It will illustrate, I

You mentioned all of the cases are out

about one forum making choice of law decisions, or

raises the same constitutional question.

you're in Federal court.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So the procedures are common

Now, his client sold $918 million worth of

Plavix in California and says it violates the

Constitution.

12

necessarily to some people, but it is greater than the

14

Now, that may not be a lot of money

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, we're

15

dealing with the jurisdictional rule, and when we do

started out with the four different factors and all

that.

have 86 in California and 575 elsewhere.

And there's a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's right.

You say handful in California, hundreds Tennessee and

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

why that's true.

they're not going be formulaic.

California could adjudicate anything in California, and

23

Those were clear, categorical rules.

24

that those clear, categorical rules could produce some

25

unfairness.

The first is there used to

to defendants.

saying, now we're going to look at the factors

7

involved --

If the Court wanted a clearer rule, clearer rules

9

The Court has abandoned them in fairness
It's very hard, I think, to blame us for

I know, but you're

articulating a rule that requires businesses trying to

10

figure out where to do business and plaintiffs where to

11

sue and courts whether it's real.

12

upon some line between handful and -- and hundreds, and

I will say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If there were 20 in

California and 575, would that satisfy due process?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

20

cannot answer that question, because --

23

I think that it is -- I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's your case.

You ought to be able to at least answer -MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Constitutional, Mr. Chief Justice.

that -- that when you have the continuous and systematic

2

bring a bunch of cases together for the benefit of all

3

of the States, it is true that there is going to be --

4

and the reason that this is not a practical problem, I

5

will tell you, is that the bar does what it did here,

6

and that is, it tries, for efficiency purposes, even if

7

for its own sake, to bring these cases together.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you

Mr. Goldstein, it seems to

11

me, on your theory, it could be zero California

12

plaintiffs, because here's what you told me.

13

me that the reason that this -- that an Ohio citizen's

14

claim arises out of the contacts in California is

15

because the contacts in California are really nationwide

16

contacts.

17

whether there are any California plaintiffs are not.

You told

And if that's so, it's met regardless of

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if that's your theory, it

20

doesn't matter whether there are 86 or 20 or zero,

21

because the contacts arise out of the

22

nationwide/California contacts.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's not correct.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The claim arises out of

25

that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's not correct, because

your test that you've articulated has two core parts to

it.

relationship between the contacts with the State and the

5

litigation.

6

7

and was critical to the --

The first is, the minimum contacts, the

And the second is the fairness of the

Yeah.

I don't think that's

Our arising out of relating to

10

test, has always been about the first part of the

11

inquiry, and then all of the four factors is a backstop

12

to that.

13

whether your claim arises out of the forum contacts.

14

It's an additional test after we decide

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I agree.

But we have to

15

satisfy both in order for there to be specific

jurisdiction.

17

case that not that much weight in your prior precedents

18

has been placed on the reasonableness factors, because

19

these have always been general jurisdiction cases.

20

These cases have always been brought as we're describing

21

them.

22

Justice Kagan, remember that it is the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Goldstein, go back

to articulating for me.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

What is your definition

of "related to"?

Remember what the Court said in making the

move from Pennoyer to International Shoe, which I'd like

to come back to --

Well, if you don't --

20

sorry, Mr. Goldstein -- but if you don't need a single

plaintiff to satisfy the first prong of the due process

inquiry, again, what function does that first prong have

left to do?

fundamental fairness test?

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Why doesn't it all just run into the second

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

What's left?
Well, because it gives the

3

State the power, the territorial power, because it does

4

have the power to adjudicate with respect to that

5

conduct.

6

It is both parts that are important.
I had said that I wanted to come back to you

7

about a bigger picture answer a -- a little while ago,

8

and that is, I do think it's really important that this

9

may be the beginning or the middle of a multi-decade

10

effort to try and take a look at the original

11

understanding of the due process clause, and do that

12

across the Court's body of precedent.

13

And we have urged the Court, if it is

14

serious about that endeavor, to take a look at the

15

relationship of International Shoe and Pennoyer, because

16

from the founding of the country up through the adoption

17

of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was perfectly clear and

18

undisputed that California could adjudicate this claim,

19

at least up to and including the assets that they have

20

in the State of California.

21

California's territory.

22

They are within

There is no dispute about that.

Then we came out with Daimler, and then they said oh,

no, we know it's not general jurisdiction.

And in this -- this very case, it

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's got to

Yes.
So one comment that --

22

that you, no doubt, know has been made about this case,

23

is that it is an attempt to reintroduce general

24

jurisdiction, which was lost in Daimler, by the

25

backdoor.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The backdoor.

Yes, exactly.

2

So important things about why that can't be right.

3

think the driving concern in cases like Daimler and

4

Goodyear about general jurisdiction is that you can hail

5

somebody into the forum and sue them about absolutely

6

anything.

7

this is being -- this suit is being brought on behalf --

8

on the basis of their conduct in the State with respect

9

to this drug.

10

I do

And this is a world of difference because

And the second is, I do think the Court

11

recognized in Daimler quite explicitly that the

12

retrenchment of general jurisdiction, how these cases

13

had always been brought -- and so there's no argument

14

that we've -- we're disrupting the legal system -- the

15

retrenchment of general jurisdiction was going to induce

16

an examination of the Court's specific personal

17

jurisdiction to fill in the gaps.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you -- this is answer

19

this in a sense -- all right.

20

just started to with Justice Ginsburg, no general

21

jurisdiction.

22

says the judge, you have enough activity in our State

23

for us to call you into court to answer to one of our

24

citizens who was hurt.

25

right?

This is -- because you

Why am I here, says defendant.

But why am I here in

Because, you see, Smith isn't a

So where that answer sounded -- this is

6

logic, and what's bothering about the whole case is its

7

logic, and I don't know the practicalities.

8

But -- but the -- you see, the logic doesn't seem the

9

same.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Right.
I cannot say, because you

12

are a citizen of Texas, because that cuts no ice in

California.

14

that does make it clear to that defendant why he is

15

here?

16

So what is it I say in a single sentence

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

You're already here on this

17

claim, and there is nothing unfair about having you have

18

it with respect to another plaintiff, because that

there is the governmental interest in that the

3

6

7

things.

The State's interest in having 600

But at the very least, the role of McKesson
here does distinguish California from every other State.

10

If they contract with a California company for the

11

nationwide distribution of this drug so that it's

12

perfectly understandable that the legal issues that

13

arise from that agreement and the distribution would be

in this forum, it's completely predictable and does

distinguish California from everyone else, everywhere

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I take you back to

Justice Breyer's question about Federal courts --

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yeah.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and multidistrict

21

litigation?

22

me think, if you didn't say it, I don't understand.

23

Assuming that there was subject matter jurisdiction,

24

that there's diversity, it still it seems to me that the

25

way -- there's no nationwide service of process here.

Because you didn't say something that makes

Alderson Reporting Company

So the Federal courts have to mimic the State courts;

2

isn't that correct?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

Then -- then I can

4

get to the end of your question, and that is it's

5

generally understood that it's the transfer of court's

6

specific personal jurisdiction.

7

would happen, Justice Breyer is saying, is you would

8

have a lawsuit, a class action that would be removed to

Federal court, specific jurisdiction would exist under

and then returned for purposes of trial.

13

Then it would

And so his point, I think, would be that it

14

would be okay in Federal court in the -- in the MDL

15

system.

16

My answer back is that there are still lots

17

of other objections about it being inconvenient, it's

18

not where he's at, there'd be choice of law issues that

19

does really -- a lot of the fairness concerns that

20

Mr. Katyal is talking about do arise in MDL, do arise in

21

the New Jersey example he gives of specific personal

is that the Court can write an opinion that simply says,

has to be confronted is that, at the very least, the

theory is exactly what this Court said in Rush, which is

why his argument in McKesson doesn't work.

asking is, what about Mr. Smith?

to Mr. Smith in Ohio, and, yes, I'm also separately

why his rule is a novel one.

launch drugs in a particular location, they're liable

for that.

That's -- we've done ceded that below.

10

That's, I think, the way specific jurisdiction works.

11

The reason why Federal -- Federal actions

12

are permissible, and they could have been permissible

13

here, Justice Breyer, is because the Fifth Amendment and

the Fourteenth Amendment operate differently.
