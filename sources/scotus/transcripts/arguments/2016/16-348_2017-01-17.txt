Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Bankruptcy Code sets up a process for

12

evaluating claims that are subject to potential

13

limitations defenses.

14

seeking to collect on a debt files a proof of claim.

15

For certain types of consumer debt, the creditor also

16

includes information to enable the trustee and other

17

parties in interest to assess the claim's timeliness and

18

where appropriate to object.

19

to go further and to certify that there is no valid

20

limitations defense to its own claim.

21

exactly what Respondent and the government are asking

22

this Court to do, under the guise of interpreting the

23

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

24
25

Under that process, a creditor

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A creditor is not required

If that is

There is nothing --

Under the Fair Debt

Collection Practices Act, suppose there were a suit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

brought in court to collect on a debt that is

2

time-barred.

3

you sued in court on a debt that was time-barred?

4

Would that violate the Fair Credit law if

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Ginsburg, our view,

5

perhaps not surprisingly, is no.

6

would be nothing misleading or unfair about the suit in

7

that instance.

8

Our view is that there

But this Court need not address that issue

9

in order to resolve the question presented here, and

10

indeed, the courts of appeals that have accepted our

11

view have largely assumed that the filing of a suit in

12

state court presents different considerations from the

13

filing of a proof of claim in bankruptcy.

14

for the simple reason that there are distinctive

15

characteristics about the operation of the bankruptcy

16

system.

17

And that is

First, and perhaps most importantly, the

18

bankruptcy system defines the term "claim" quite broadly

19

to include any circumstance in which there is a right to

20

payment.

21

not there is a right to payment is defined under state

22

law, and Alabama law is clear that the running of a

23

limitations period does not extinguish the right; the

24

right remains.

25

takes some action to make repayment, the right springs

And as this Court held in Butner, whether or

And so, for instance, if the debtor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

back into life, indeed, the right never disappears in

2

the first place, but the right, once again, becomes

3

judicially enforceable.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there -- are there any

5

circumstances, just as a practical matter, where the

6

trustee decides that the trustee is going to pay the

7

time-barred debt, it's obviously prejudicial to the

8

other creditors.

9

trying to think of that.

Are there any -- I was -- I was just
I -- I can't think of any

10

instance in which a trustee would want to do that.

11

was thinking suppose the debtor wanted to continue a

12

business relation with the -- with -- with the creditor

13

whose debt is time-barred, and -- and as for -- but I --

14

I just can't think of any instance.

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I

But perhaps --

No, and -- and -- and

16

Justice Kennedy, I can't think of any instance either,

17

and I think that that's precisely because the trustee

18

has the statutory duty to object, to preserve the assets

19

of the estate, and to do so for the creditors.

20

again, that is a critical feature of the bankruptcy

21

system.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

And,

I'm having a

23

great deal of difficulty with this business model.

24

Completely.

25

certainty are not within any statute of limitations.

You buy old, old debts that you know for

You buy them and you call up creditors and you say to

2

them, you don't have to pay me.

3

of your heart, you should?

4

and say, you owe me money, and you hope that they'll pay

5

you.

6

But out of the goodness

Or do you just call them up

And is it the same thing in bankruptcy

8

doesn't see that it's out of time?

9

collect on millions of dollars of these debts.

10

You filed a claim and you hope the trustee
And apparently, you
So is

that what you do?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Sotomayor, I do

12

not think that that is a valid understanding of our

13

business model, and let me explain why.

14

First, this debt was not time-barred at the

15

time it was purchased.

16

makes every effort not to purchase time-barred debt.

17

Now, of course, they're not always correct in their

18

assessments, and debt that is not time-barred at the

19

time of purchase can come --

20

And indeed, Midland, my client,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did you have a

21

good-faith basis in this case to believe that the debt

22

was not time-barred --

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

claim?

Well --- when you filed this

Forget about some of the others.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Just to be clear, there is

2

actually no allegation in this case that we knew that

3

there was a valid limitations defense.

4

look at the complaint in this case, and if you take a

5

look at page 25 of the Joint Appendix in particular, all

6

that the complaint alleges is that we were aware of the

7

very facts that we disclosed in the proof of claim.

8

Facts that, to be sure, indicated the existence of a

9

potential limitations defense.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you take a

Because, after all -Did you have a

11

good-faith basis to believe the statute of limitations

12

was not applicable?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Midland at the time would

14

file proofs of claim without conducting some sort of

15

exhaustive inquiry, and that's for the simple reason

16

that Midland did not believe that that was legally

17

required.

18

issue --

19

And so, again, there is no record on this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do you do with

20

the committee notes that say that everyone who files a

21

proof of claim has an obligation to do a good-faith

22

inquiry as to whether it's an enforceable obligation or

23

not?

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't think that that is

an accurate characterization of what the advisory

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

committee did.

2
3

And let me first --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no.

Not what they

did; what they said.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't think that that's an

5

accurate characterization of what they said, either.

6

And let me explain why that's true.

7

First of all, let me set out what the

8

advisory committee actually did, because that's a

9

critical part of our argument.

In Rule 3001(c)(3),

10

which was adopted in 2012, the advisory committee

11

required certain disclosures, the whole point of which

12

was to put trustees and other parties in interest on

13

notice of the potential availability of a limitations

14

defense.

15

And the advisory committee thought about

16

going further.

17

what Respondent and the government are asking this Court

18

to do under the FDCPA; namely, to require a

19

certification that having investigated the existence of

20

a limitations defense, the creditor had made a

21

determination that there was no valid such defense.

22

It thought about doing, again, exactly

Now, the advisory committee decided not to

23

do that, Justice Sotomayor, and it decided not to do

24

that for two critical reasons.

25

advisory committee recognized that the question of

The first was that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

whether or not there is a valid limitations defense

2

as -- as opposed to the question of whether or not the

3

claim appears to be time-barred, could be complicated.

4

And it could be complicated even in the context of

5

consumer debts like these ones, because of the potential

6

for revival and tolling, choice-of-law issues, and the

7

like.

8

The second reason --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I agree with you.

But

10

if -- if that is true that you investigated and you had

11

a good-faith basis for believing that it wasn't

12

time-barred, you wouldn't be liable either under the

13

bankruptcy rules or under these debtor rules.

14

the point is if you were unaware and didn't properly

15

investigate, have you fulfilled your obligations as a

16

lawyer to the bankruptcy court?

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So -- but

And our view, Justice

18

Sotomayor, just to be clear, is that you have done

19

exactly what the code itself contemplates.

20

And this goes to the second reason why the

21

advisory committee did not go further.

22

committee expressed a concern that if it had gone

23

further, it could be violating the Bankruptcy Rules

24

Enabling Act because it would be acting inconsistently

25

with the burden-shifting framework that the code itself

Alderson Reporting Company

The advisory

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

devised.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

remember reading that in these.

4

record cite for that?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

I don't

Could you give me a

I -Or you can do it in your

reply.

8
9

I'm sorry.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No.

It's -- it's in our

brief --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Or --

It's in our brief at page --

12

I believe it's at page 86 of the Agenda Book where the

13

advisory committee working group discusses the proposal

14

to require creditors to, quote, "State whether the claim

15

is timely under the relevant statute of limitations."

16

But let me explain that point in a little

17

more detail, because I do think that this is really

18

important to understanding our argument here.

19

that the Bankruptcy Code operates is first, that a party

20

is entitled -- a creditor is entitled to file a proof of

21

claim where they have a right to payment.

22

point, the burden shifts.

23

valid.

24

enforceability of the claim, that is an issue that has

25

to be raised by the trustee or by another party in

The way

And at that

The claim is presumptively

And if there is an issue concerning the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

interest or else the claim will be allowed.

2

Now, what I think Respondent and the

3

government are trying to do here is to really align two

4

separate concepts:

5

hand and the question of enforceability on the other.

6

And I think Respondent, in particular, is attempting to

7

somehow build the concept of enforceability into the

8

definition of a claim.

9

The question of validity on the one

But how we know that that is not true is by

10

virtue of the fact that in Section 502(b), the

11

statute -- the code specifically provides that

12

enforceability is a basis for objecting and for

13

disallowing a claim.

14

whether or not you have a valid claim in the first

15

place.

16
17
18

It doesn't go to the question of

So, once again, all of this really depends
critically -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- I'm -- I'm a

19

little bit confused.

20

that some people will file unenforceable claims even

21

though they shouldn't, that that somehow proves that the

22

code invites unenforceable claims?

23

The fact that the code anticipates

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Quite to the contrary,

24

Justice Sotomayor.

25

happen because the code defines claims expansively.

The code specifically wants this to

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

that is because in 1978, when Congress adopted the

2

Bankruptcy Code, it adopted this broad definition of

3

claim to bring claims into the bankruptcy estate.

4

there is --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

Contingent, unmatured,

6

these are all words that suggest an entitlement to

7

payment.

8

words talk about a claim that's unenforceable?

9

contingent claim may not be enforceable today, but it

10

Where in the definition any use of word -- of
A

might be in the future.

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I agree with the first half

12

of your question, but not the second, Justice Sotomayor,

13

because you're right:

14

entitlement to payment.

15

have here.

16

examples of types of rights to payment, contingent

17

claims or unmatured claims, that illustrates that the

18

definition of claim includes rights to payment that may

19

not be presently enforceable.

20

The code talks about an
But that is precisely what we

And to the extent that the code includes as

Again, the question of enforceability is a

21

question that arises with regard to objections.

22

not relate to the question of an entitlement to file a

23

claim.

24

Bankruptcy Code works.

25

It does

And this is critical to understanding how the

Now, how the Bankruptcy Code works in turn

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

informs the application of the actual language of the

2

FDCPA, which is, after all, the question before this

3

Court.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Before you get to that

5

language, Mr. Shanmugam.

6

just from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to

7

understand why Congress would want all these

8

unenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only

9

two things can happen.

Could you just -- you know,

One is that the trustee will

10

properly filter out those claims; and the other is that

11

the trustee will be swamped and won't have the time or

12

the energy or the inclination or he'll make mistakes,

13

and some of those claims will be deemed enforceable

14

when, in fact, they're not.

15
16
17

So why would anybody want these proofs of
claim to flood into the bankruptcy system?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Kagan, two

18

responses to that.

19

we don't know that these claims are unenforceable.

20

think what we know is that there is an apparent time bar

21

to these claims.

22

the proof of claim illustrate that.

23

further work to be done before an ultimate legal

24

determination can be made about whether there is a valid

25

limitations defense.

The first is that, again, you know,
I

The very facts that are disclosed in

Alderson Reporting Company

And there is some

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

And Congress very consciously put that

2

burden on the trustee and other parties in interest in

3

the Bankruptcy Code.

4

other party in interest can come in and object and the

5

issue can be litigated.

6

The trustee or the debtor or any

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I -- but I -- the

7

understanding here is that this case involves not claims

8

which maybe they're barred by the statute of limitations

9

and maybe they're not, but the issue, as presented to

10

us, is as to claims where everybody knows, including the

11

person who's filing the proof of claim, that they're

12

barred by the statute of limitations.

13

And what sense could it make for Congress to

14

think, oh, that's a great idea for some -- for people

15

just to file those claims and -- and, you know, the --

16

on the -- on -- the best thing that can happen is that

17

those claims will be filtered out, and the worst thing

18

that can happen is that they won't be.

19

mistakes and people will pay on things that they

20

shouldn't be paying on.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yeah.

People will make

And Justice Kagan,

22

just to be clear, I'm disputing the assumption that we

23

somehow acted with knowledge here.

24

this Court to consider this case, as we said in footnote

25

1 of our brief, on the assumption that if there had been

Alderson Reporting Company

But I'm happy for

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

an objection, the claim would have been disallowed.

2

I think that the answer, though, is still

3

the same.

4

system in the Code, must have known that some number of

5

claims would be allowed that should otherwise be

6

disallowed if there is an objection.

7

that is the unelectable consequence of imposing the

8

burden on responsive parties in deeming claims to be

9

valid, absent and objection.

10

And I think that Congress, in adopting this

Because after all,

But the reason -- the affirmative reason why

11

Congress would have wanted to do that is precisely

12

because of the fresh start principle that underlies the

13

entire bankruptcy system.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is part of that -- help

15

me, it's on basic bankruptcy law.

16

I know that the claim is time barred.

17

claim with the trustee just to be sure that it can be a

18

part of the discharge that the claim is -- that -- that

19

the claim is extinguished and I can't later be sued?

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Suppose I'm a debtor.
Do I list that

I think it should be listed

21

for the simple reason that there is a valid claim and

22

there is, therefore, a valid right to payment.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As a routine matter,

does -- does the discharge extinguish that claim?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that is correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

the virtue --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why would need -- if

3

a claim is time barred, you don't need a fresh start to

4

get rid of that claim.

5

therefore, no claim.

6

bankruptcy to accomplish that.

7

You say it's time barred,
You don't need a discharge in

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Ginsburg, I disagree

8

with that solely because of the virtue of a discharge.

9

And the virtue of a discharge is that in the language of

10

the Code and the language in particular of Section

11

523(a)(3), the discharge prevents the creditor from

12

taking any act to collect.

13

encourage the debtor, notwithstanding the absence of a

14

judicial remedy, to make any sort of payment, which I

15

think Respondent acknowledges that a debtor retains --

16

we have some ability to do even after --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that includes efforts to

It would also foreclose

18

the possibility of the creditor arguing that there had

19

been a waiver.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

I guess --

In other words, if the

22

debt is discharged, then the debtor doesn't have to

23

worry about some claim that he had waived the statute of

24

limitations.

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

Well, that is correct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

in the sense that, again, the creditor can take no

2

action to collect even a sort of voluntary request for

3

payment.

4

addition, as we explained in our brief, discharge has

5

other collateral consequences in prohibiting certain

6

types of discrimination based on the existence of debts.

7

And those are the very principles that again underlie,

8

not just the Code more generally, but the very broad

9

definition of claim in particular.

And that has very real value.

And in

And that really was

10

an innovation of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, namely,

11

replacing the old provability system with a very broad

12

definition of claim that was meant to bring claims

13

within the bankruptcy process.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We are talking about the

15

effect of the FDCPA.

be no point in making a claim for a debt that's clearly

skipped.

20

that it's a good claim when, in fact, it isn't.

21

And isn't it so that there would

No point in doing that except for the

And that you will get paid on the assumption

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, again, I think that

22

that question, Justice Ginsburg, presupposes a state of

23

mind, which is simply not alleged and on which there is

24

simply no record in this case or in other cases.

25

don't want to fight that factual premise too hard

Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

because I think that even if such a state of mind

2

exists, the operation of the Code is the same.

3

the state of mind of the creditor is neither here nor

4

there for purposes of the operation of the Code.

5

sole question for purposes of the operation of the Code

6

is whether or not there is a right to payment.

7

when these proofs of claim were filed, the -- there --

8

there is not an extensive further investigation at that

9

point, or at least I'm certainly not aware of one on the

Again,

The

And so

10

part of in my client or on the part of debt collectors

11

more generally.

12

What the debt collector is obligated to do

13

under the Code and under the rules is to disclose the

14

information that essentially provides the world notice

15

of a prima facie limitation.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry.

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I was going to bring

18

this back to the language of the Code because I did want

19

to address that, but Justice Kagan.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let's suppose that you are

21

right, that the Code allows this.

22

me to believe that the Code actively invites it, but

23

let's suppose, as it's written, allows that.

24

you wouldn't violate the Code by filing these proofs of

25

claim.

That's -- that's for sure.

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, it's hard for

collectors, there's an independent rule and the Code

7

says nothing about that.

You don't have to do

It's a choice.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yeah.

And then another

So let me address,

first, the specific language of the FDCPA.

And I want

10

to put down a marker because I want to address the

11

separate issue of how the FDCPA and the Bankruptcy Code

12

relate.

13

We think that the operation of the

14

Bankruptcy Code informs the analysis under the two

15

relevant provisions of the FDCPA.

16

question of whether or not we made false or misleading

17

representations and second, the question of whether or

18

not this is an unfair or unconscionable practice.

19

First, on the

On the question of 1692e, our submission is

20

quite straightforward that there is nothing false or

21

misleading about the submission of a proof of claim that

22

is not only entirely accurate, but that affirmatively

23

puts the world on notice as to the existence of a

24

potential limitations defense.

25

And to go to the second prong of this, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

question of whether or not such a proof of claim is

2

misleading, our submission is that the filing of a proof

3

of claim implies only a good-faith basis that the

4

creditor has a claim.

5

the enforceability of the claim more generally or about

6

the availability of a limitations defense more

7

specifically other than providing affirmative notice

8

that such a potential defense exists.

9

It doesn't imply anything about

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

What do you

10

do with the language of Pennsylvania Public Welfare v.

11

Davenport where we explicitly said that a claim is a

12

right to payment and enforceable obligation?

13

you do with that language?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

What do

Well, I don't think that --

15

that that even rises to the level of, in the parlance of

16

the last argument, a drive-by holding.

17

the simple reason that neither Davenport nor the later

18

cases citing Davenport in any way purported to somehow

19

exclude unenforceable rights from the definition of a

20

claim.

21

question was enforceable in some respect.

22

question was whether the fact that the enforcement

23

mechanism was limited somehow affected whether or not it

24

came within the definition of claim, and the Court said

25

no.

And that's for

In Davenport, everyone agreed that the right in

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

But, again, if you thought that that rose to

2

the level of even a passing holding, I would return to

3

the language of the Bankruptcy Code and, in particular,

4

the definition of a claim which says nothing about

5

enforceability.

6

enforceability into the objections that have to be

7

raised.

8
9

To the contrary, Section 502 builds

Now, I do want to say a bit about the other
provision of the FDCPA, the provision that prohibits

10

unfair or unconscionable practices.

11

that provision, we would rely centrally on the

12

protections provided by the bankruptcy system.

13

remembering that a proof of claim, unlike a civil

14

lawsuit, is not filed against the debtor.

15

against the estate.

16

trustee bears a statutory obligation to monitor proofs

17

of claim.

18

And I think that on

It bears

It is filed

And as we've been discussing, the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's a breach of the

19

trustee's duties if he or she lets the claim go through

20

without objecting?

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

22

served.

23

have concern --

24
25

If some purpose would be

And, Justice Sotomayor, to the extent that you

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Kennedy's initial question.

Well, that was Justice

What would be the purpose

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

of a trustee permitting a stale claim to go forward?

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The trustee should object

3

where, in the language of the statute, some purpose

4

would be served.

5

contexts in which an objection might be futile because

6

it would have no effect on any of the other creditors or

7

certainly on the amount that the debtor pays.

8

otherwise, the trustee should object.

9

that to the extent that you have concern about --

10

And I think there are actually

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

And I would say

Where -- where would

11

that situation arise?

12

might be -- the debtor pays might be true, but every

13

other creditor loses if an unenforceable debt is paid.

14

The amount the creditor pays

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There -- there could be a

15

case in which the unsecured creditors get nothing.

16

at that point, it doesn't make any difference because

17

none of the unsecured creditors are going to get paid

18

and there are other similar circumstances.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

So those situations

20

don't account for the $800 million you've collected on

21

these old claims.

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I don't -- I don't

23

think that there is a record on how much we've collected

24

with regard to this particular type of claim more

25

generally.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

But leaving that aside, I want to make one

2

very important point about the interplay between the

3

Bankruptcy Code and the FDCPA here.

4

Respondent's briefs sort of has this genus-like quality.

5

Because Respondents fight this to some extent on the

6

operation of the Bankruptcy Code.

7

the principal beef that Respondent has here is that the

8

bankruptcy system just isn't works as it should.

9

I think that

But I think, really,

If you take a look at pages 29 to 30 of

10

Respondent's brief, Respondent really makes the broader

11

point that trustees and other parties in interest aren't

12

simply objecting as often as they should in bankruptcy

13

and that frustrates --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I just ask you a

15

practical question?

16

a trustee or the attorney for a debtor said, I am going

17

to -- let's say this case is in Alabama.

18

limitations for the collection of debt in Alabama is six

19

years.

20

debt that was incurred more than six years ago.

21

Would -- would that be inconsistent with the duties of

22

the trustee or the attorney?

23

Would there be anything -- suppose

The statute of

I am going to object to every -- any claim for a

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I mean, no, not necessarily,

24

because at that point essentially what -- what would be

25

happening is that the trustee would say there's a prima

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

facie limitations defense here, we're going to raise an

2

objection, and at that point the issue would be

3

litigated.

4

didn't come back and request a hearing or otherwise

5

litigate the issue, it -- I think it's quite possible,

6

depending on the nature of the objection, that the

7

objection would be sustained and that the claim would be

8

disallowed.

9
10

And if the creditor in that circumstance

Again -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'll -- I'll ask

11

Mr. Geyser the same question, but it -- I can't

12

understand why a trustee or an attorney wouldn't take

13

that -- wouldn't take that approach --

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- automatically object to

16
17

anything that is over the -- the statute of limitations.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well -- and I think that

18

this illustrates the artificiality of taking the FDCPA

19

and injecting it into the bankruptcy regime.

20

To be sure, the FDCPA applies to debt

21

collectors specifically, but I think in this context,

22

what would either happen is that there will be an

23

objection and the claim will be disallowed -- that's

24

what took place in this case, albeit on somewhat

25

different grounds.

And, of course, in that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

circumstance, there is no harm to the actual debtor

2

because the claim has, in fact, been disallowed.

3

If, in fact, the claim has been allowed, it

4

seems quite odd to say that you could still bring an

5

FDCPA action, because what you would effectively be

6

doing is collaterally challenging the bankruptcy court's

7

decision to allow the claim in the first place.

8

we explained in our brief -- and we make this point not

9

only specifically with regard to the standing of this

And as

10

plaintiff, but really with regard to this whole category

11

of cases -- one of the reasons why this practice is not

12

unfair or unconscionable is that it is very hard to

13

posit a circumstance in which it will actually lead to

14

an injury to the debtor.

15

reason --

16

And it's really for that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

You're

17

taking up trustee time, which gets paid by the debtor

18

ultimately and at administrative cost.

19

up the time of other creditors, because there has to be,

20

when an objection is raised, notice to all the

21

creditors, a hearing date set, all of these procedural

22

steps that are unnecessary because you have no basis to

23

believe that this debt is enforceable.

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You are taking

Speaking of time, I'd like

to reserve the balance of mine, but let me answer your

26
1

question, Justice Sotomayor.

2

It is simply not true that the amount that

3

the trustee gets paid is somehow dependent on the

4

objections that the trustee raises, and I would revert

5

to the fundamental principle underlying our argument.

6

This is exactly how Congress thought the system should

work.

8

not working as Congress intended, the solution is to fix

the bankruptcy system and not to extend the FDCPA into

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What --

Are there other

defenses to a debt that you would say are covered by

5

your theory other than the statute of limitations?

example, that the -- the debt was incurred to a contract

of adhesion or, you know, the -- the normal list of

reasons that a debt might be unenforceable.

10

MR. GEYSER:

For

Does your

Our theory, I think, is exactly

11

what Justice Sotomayor said earlier in the argument.

12

debt collector has to have a good faith belief that they

13

have a right to payment under the code and have a valid

14

and enforceable debt.

15

to think that -- that an affirmative defense might not

16

apply, then they don't violate the FDCPA.

A

If they have any reasonable basis

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then what that means

18

is that not just in this case, not just with statute of

claims that can be brought in bankruptcy where you would

say they don't.

No.

We do

Now, I thought the point

So how do you reconcile what you are

Your Honor, I think the point

of the Bankruptcy Code is to have legitimate genuine
disputes resolved in the Bankruptcy Code.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Really?

Really.

How

in -- I mean, are there cases in bankruptcy court where

purpose?

clear, our theory doesn't cover that situation.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh.

If a

comes in and says, I admit I had no good-faith reason

for bringing this.

That's the only thing your theory

covers?

2

MR. GEYSER:

No.

This is the situation it

3

covers, and this is all it covers.

4

defense, a complete defense, is obvious on the face of

5

the claim, and if there is not an articulable reason to

6

think that that complete defense may not apply, this is

7

exactly the same standard that applies, and all five

8

courts of appeals have looked at this.

shifting the burden, this is not imposing an affirmative

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- well, but

14

how do you know that's the case in the statute of

15

limitations with respect to a statute of limitations

16

defense?

17

limitations that -- that -- totally -- you know, the

18

whole list of -- so it's hard to say.

spelled out -- we -- we have to have spelled out the

sort of basis.

you've proposed, then it ought to be obvious to the

tolling argument that could be raised in this case?

MR. GEYSER:

have alleged that Midland did, in fact, know there was

no defense of limitations objection.

MR. GEYSER:

So -- there was, Your Honor.

been clear in this.

expressly allege that Midland acted with knowledge.

It's since been amended to

Okay.

Let's take

19

the case where the dates, since you asked, it's six

20

years that was incurred, however many years beyond that,

21

and you say they -- they should just not raise it, or

22

you say that they should inquire somehow to make sure

23

that there wasn't a basis for tolling the -- the

24

statute?

25

What -- what do they have to do?
MR. GEYSER:

All -- all they have to do is

satisfy and discharge the obligation they have to

satisfy and discharge under Rule 9011.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a basic --

Well, tell me what

that is.

5

MR. GEYSER:

It's -- it is a reasonable

6

belief, after a reasonable inquiry, that they have a --

7

a ground for the complaint, that the evidentiary

8

allegations have some factual support, and that the

9

claim isn't filed for --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's -- it's not

11

enough for them to say there might be, it's -- you know,

there -- a tolling issue here.

is that that's exactly how bankruptcy works.

Your Honor -They may -- may not be

raised?

MR. GEYSER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what -If the defense isn't

10

raised as an affirmative defense, as a matter of

11

pleading I assume in some jurisdictions, and it goes to

12

trial and you say, oh, judge, this is time barred, the

13

judge will say, too late, you didn't raise the defense.

14

MR. GEYSER:

An affirmative defense can't

15

be -- can be waived, but I think what's important is

16

that all five courts of appeals that have looked at this

17

have said that if you bring the complaint knowing that

18

it's subject to a complete defense, you're imposing

19

unnecessary costs on a defendant to object.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

It may not be.

I mean it

21

depends on the circumstance.

bothering me and I -- and I put it in a sort of -- you

23

have a very good argument.

24

I'm telling you what's worrying me.

25

But that isn't what's

I'm not saying you don't.

What's worrying me is that we take a set of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33

cases, which now you've -- you've narrowed it to that

2

set which is sanctionable under Rule 9011, which is a

3

bankruptcy rule with sanctions.

4

addition to the sanctions, the person who -- the debtor

5

can go and bring a different case now under the word

6

"unfair" in the debt collection act.

7

And you're saying in

And I'm saying what's worrying me, and I'd

8

like to hear what you say specifically, is that here we

9

have two sets of courts; one with the power to sanction;

10

the other the ordinary Article III court, which

11

presumably will automatically give $1,000 per violation,

12

you know, plus attorneys' fees, plus costs.

13

seems what the bankruptcy court was trying to avoid.

want bankruptcy matters decided in bankruptcy court.

argument against you.

17

hear what you have to say in response.

18

And that

I have a point.

MR. GEYSER:

And I'd like to

We appreciate that.

I think

19

the -- the ultimate response is what Congress intended

20

with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which it

21

specifically designed for remedies for professional debt

22

collectors, realizing that ordinary remedies like Rule

23

9011 sanctions that are calibrated for general creditors

24

aren't always enough.

25

inventive, they impose heightened risks, and you often

Professional debt collectors are

need a heightened remedy to check their conduct, which I

2

think is exactly what we see here.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if -- if the States

4

were so worried about that, why don't all States do what

5

apparently two States do?

6

limitation runs, the debt is barred forever.

7

apparently, many States don't say that.

8

can still sue.

having in this case.

MR. GEYSER:

Well -- well, to be perfectly

14

clear, even States that don't eliminate the debt,

15

there's still not a right to payment, it's not

16

enforceable in any way that's not purely voluntary.

in Alabama -- and this is, I think, critical here -- it

actually gives rise not just to a sanctionable act, but

to a tort.

MR. GEYSER:

Well, the most complicated one

I can think of we can dispose of very quickly, because

anytime there's a good-faith basis defense --

affirmative defense might not apply, we don't have an

12

FDCPA claim.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what are the other

affirmative defenses that your argument might apply to?

15

MR. GEYSER:

I think one example could be a

release.

17

and then the debt collector the next day in the

18

bankruptcy files a proof of claim on exactly the same

19

debt they just released.

of the sort of defenses that are involved in any suit?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

We've been

I was asking, are

MR. GEYSER:

Do some

I can't think of one off the

litigate it in the FDCPA lawsuit.

set of cases that would warrant a sanction under Rule

the difficult thing is, of course, proving what it was.

Because I get my attorneys' fees and a thousand

I grant you the easy

10

Now -- now do you see what is worrying me?

11

MR. GEYSER:

I do, I do, Justice Breyer.

I

12

think that in the bankruptcy setting, first of all,

13

given the speed of the proof of claim process, the odds

14

are the objection will be adjudicated before the FDCPA

15

suit is -- is far underway or underway at all, which is

16

actually what happened in this case.

17

I also think that in most circumstances, the

18

state of mind can be satisfied by the creditor by simply

19

articulating any reason they filed the -- the suit.

20

They simply have to explain, why did you -- why did you

21

think you were entitled to collect?

24

says by filing a proof of claim, I believe I have a

Because every claim

And when a debt collector

know that's not true, then they are misstating the

2

character and the legal status of the debt.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

May I ask you the question

4

that I -- I asked your -- your adversary.

5

these time-barred claims slip through?

6

big part of your argument.

7

attorneys for the debtor automatically object to any

8

claim that is beyond the number of years set out in the

9

statute of limitations?

10

MR. GEYSER:

Why -- why do

I mean, that's a

Why don't trustees and

I think there are two reasons

11

that they don't.

12

objecting is sometimes more than the benefit of

13

excluding the claim.

14

They often will acquiesce in a legitimate payout simply

15

to avoid the nuisance value of the objection, which I

16

think is unfair.

17
18

The first is that the cost of

These are nuisance-value claims.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is there a big cost

in -- in filing an objection?

19

MR. GEYSER:

According to -- to the National

20

Association of Bankruptcy Attorneys, it often takes two

21

to three hours to do all the paperwork, serve the

22

parties.

23

that does impose a cost on the system.

It might not seem like very much, but that --

24

The other reason that the trustees --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I can't believe you couldn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

even have -- you could have a computer program that does

2

this automatically.

3

very difficult.

4

I can't understand why it would be

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, even if it took

5

only an hour, you're talking about hundreds of thousands

6

of claims filed each year, which, in the aggregate,

7

amounts to an awful lot of time.

8

The other reason that the trustees --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But how many of these would

10

there be in the typical Chapter 13?

11

MR. GEYSER:

What -- what we've seen in at

12

least the cases that have had a chance to go past the

13

pleading stage is that the trustee, for example, the

14

Middle District of Alabama processes between 6 and 7,000

15

claims a month.

16

review a claim every two minutes for 365 days a year --

17

So to review the claims, they have to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

claims are you talking about?

19

claims?

20

MR. GEYSER:

But what kind of

These -- these kinds of

Well, claims filed in the

21

bankruptcy.

22

limit the bankruptcy process to legitimate claims.

23

But the -- the point is Congress wanted to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then it's

24

logistically, it's every claim that they -- they look

25

at?

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. GEYSER:

that they have to sort through.

3
4

That -- those are the claims
And I don't -- I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That doesn't tell us

very much about how many of these claims there are.

5

MR. GEYSER:

Well, sometimes we don't know

6

how many claims of these nature there are because

7

sometimes they slip through and no one notices them.

8
9

And the other reason that the trustees don't
always object, Justice Alito, and they've told us

10

this -- the -- the Chapter 13 trustees at page 15 of

11

their brief, there -- there's an information asymmetry.

12

Trustees assume that creditors act in good faith.

13

they assume if there's a facially time-barred claim,

14

it's possible the creditor is aware of some basis for

15

tolling.

16

is thinking, and so they might not object, which is a

17

way that these claims are, in fact, misleading, even to

18

sophisticated trustees.

19

So

And the trustee doesn't know what the creditor

So the real point is that Midland wouldn't

20

file these claims if the system actually functioned the

21

way that Congress intended.

22

and everyone objected the way they were supposed to,

23

these claims would always lose.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

If -- if it did function

I find this is a very

difficult case because if -- if your description of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

Midland's business model is correct, it doesn't seem to

2

me that it has much, if any, social utility.

3

On the other hand, I have real a problem

4

with your -- with fitting your argument into the concept

5

of an affirmative defense.

6

defense was a rule of law that may allow the defendant

7

to prevail if the defendant asserts the defense.

8

you want to switch -- you're switching that over to the

9

side of the plaintiff or the person filing the claim.

I thought an affirmative

10

It seems inconsistent with the whole idea of an

11

affirmative defense.

12

But

The idea of an affirmative defense -- let's

13

take statute of limitations.

14

defendant may escape liability based on the statute of

15

limitations, but only if a defendant asserts the defense

16

and, if necessary, proves it.

17

doesn't do that, then the law is perfectly content with

18

having a recovery on a claim that would have otherwise

19

been time barred.

20

MR. GEYSER:

The idea is that the

And if a defendant

Well, I -- I think that, again,

21

we're -- we're not talking about affirmative defenses

22

that aren't obvious on the face of the -- of the claim.

Under Rule 9011 -- and -- and just thinking about the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

very different.

different priorities and all of that.

more significant if you have things spinning out of the

fact that you might have it as a general matter in -- in

10

The whole idea is let's get everything

I think it's much

district courts.

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

12

it's a bedrock principle of bankruptcy that a creditor's

13

rights with respect to a debt are defined by State law.

14

When a debt is time barred, State law has determined

15

that that debt is not judicially enforceable.

16

in the bankruptcy gives a creditor an extra right to

17

judicially enforce the debt.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Nothing

That's -Do you place any weight

19

on this Fair Debt Collection Act being limited to

20

particular kinds of creditors; that is, this is not for

21

22

collectors.

23

It is only for these debt

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's right, Justice

24

way we think --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

If that's so, then why

4

not -- what about this.

5

solution and so I'm pretty nervous.

6

I'd really do this.

7

the debt collection act is unfair and where it's in

8

bankruptcy, there's a whole system to decide if it's

9

unfair by people who know about it.

It's a little complicated as a
I don't know that

But you'd say okay.

The word in

So where a

10

bankruptcy court does in fact say that it's unfair and

11

sanctions a party for this unfair behavior.

12

case, it's unfair within the meaning of the debt

13

collection act and in that case, you can go and bring

14

your extra remedy.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

In that

So there are two reasons, I

16

think, why that would not work.

17

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there's a safe haven in

18

Rule 9011, just like there is in Rule 11 since 1993 that

19

allows a creditor to withdraw in offending a proof of

20

claim when it's objected to.

21

out, if a -- if a creditor really has a basis for -- a

22

good-faith basis for believing that its claim is

23

enforceable, it will presumably assert that in response

24

to an objection.

25

The first is, as

Now, I just want to point

That's not what happened here.

But the second is that there is even more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

reason to be cautious about this in bankruptcy than

2

there is in general civil litigation.

3

operation of Rule 3001 of the bankruptcy rules and

4

Section 502 of the Code, a proof of claim, when it's

5

failed, makes the underlying claim presumptively valid.

6
7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think this good faith

defense is objective or subjective?

8
9

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

So -- but

It's -- it

That's sanctionable

As a practical matter, it

probably wouldn't be because they would withdraw.

under your interpretation.

believing that their claims are warranted by existing

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the ordinary civil

MS. HARRINGTON:

But -- but not in

MS. HARRINGTON:

In our view these are

claims within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so they can't proceed

5

in the -- the -- under the ^ cap? debt act until the

6

bankruptcy is over.

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's true, yes.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

9

MS. HARRINGTON:

And -- and also, you know,

10

in terms of the discharge, the FDCPA gives the debtor

11

the right to ask not to be contacted any more by a debt

12

collector, which is basically the functional equivalent

13

of a discharge, and the anti-discrimination provisions

14

apply to any dischargeable debt, not just debt that has

15

been discharged, and so that would apply to these -- to

16

these types of debts.

17

And so I just think it -- there is nothing

18

in the code that gives a creditor the right to try to

19

sneak one through when the creditor knows that if it's

20

objected to, it should be disallowed --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24
25

Is your argument --- 100 percent of the time.

the code that precludes these kinds of claims?
MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Yes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if -- if one looked at

2

the code and said, well, it seems as though these kinds

3

of claims, although unenforceable, can be filed, if that

4

was your view of the code, what do you think follows

5

from that?

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

So then I think it would

7

not be unfair and it would not misleading, and if I'd

8

like -- if I could, I'd like to tell you why.

9

the reason it's unfair here is because the creditor does

It's --

10

not have a right to get paid in bankruptcy on this type

11

of claim and so it's unfair to try to do that and to put

12

the other participants to the burden of making sure that

13

it doesn't happen.

14

It's misleading because when you file a

15

proof of claim under Rule 9011 you're making an implicit

16

representation -- may I finish my sentence?

17

have done a reasonable investigation and have a good

18

faith basis for believing that the claim is warranted.

19

If it is warranted under the Bankruptcy Code then that's

20

not misleading.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

Mr. Chief Justice.

2

Just two points on rebuttal.

First, I

3

think, with all due respect, the Court should be

4

concerned about the breadth of Respondent's position,

5

and let me lay out circumstances that I think would be

6

covered by Respondent's rule.

7

A circumstance in which a claim has been

8

discharged in a previous bankruptcy, a circumstance, in

9

which a claim has in fact actually been paid off.

A

10

circumstance in which the claim is subject to a setoff,

11

or a circumstance in which the creditor simply gets the

12

wrong amount or the wrong person.

13

I'm reliably informed, recur with some frequency in

14

bankruptcy proceedings, and yet, in all of those

15

circumstances, after an objection is raised and the

16

claim is disallowed.

17

claim itself was false or misleading under the FDCPA,

18

and a holding in Respondent's favor would really be a

19

recipe for clogging the courts with these sorts of FDCPA

20

claims.

21

These circumstances,

There could be a claim that the

And I would note, parenthetically, that to

22

the extent the Respondent and the government's argument

23

presupposes some absence of a good faith basis for

24

believing that some of these objections are invalid.

25

That's very hard to reconcile with the language of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

FDCPA because if there is one established principle

2

about the operation of the FDCPA, it is that there is no

3

affirmative state of mind requirement.

4

Respondent and the government would be asking you to do

5

is to say, sure, there could be a prima facie claim

6

under the FDCPA, but the only way in which a creditor

7

could escape liability would be to invoke the

8

affirmative defense in Section 1692k paragraph c, where

9

the violation is not intentional and results from a bona

And so what

10

fide error which requires the maintenance of procedures

11

reasonably calculated to avoid that error.

12

And so, again, this is going to be a recipe

13

for bringing these FDCPA actions into play, and many,

14

many bankruptcies.

15

And that leads me to my second point, which

16

is that this Court has never applied the FDCPA within

17

the four corners of a bankruptcy proceeding, and I think

18

that the problem with doing so here is that it really

19

doesn't address the principle concern that Respondent

20

and the government raises, and let me give you an

21

example as to why that's true.

22

Suppose you have a bank that holds credit

23

card debt, and that bank actually doesn't sell that debt

24

on to a debt collector.

25

very same thing.

Well, that bank could do the

It could file a proof of claim, it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

61
1

would be required to disclose that there is a prima

2

facie limitations defense, and yet, if that bank does

3

not qualify as a debt collector under the definition of

4

the FDCPA.

5

that simply illustrates the fact that this is really a

6

problem, if it is, in fact, a problem, with the

7

operation of bankruptcy, and it's a problem that

8

Congress or the advisory committee are -- are best

9

situated to remedy, and so, for instance, if there is

FDCPA liability would not be available, and

10

concern about the limitations defense, one solution is

11

to eliminate the fact that that's a defense, and for

12

Congress to shift the burden back on to the creditor.

13

But, again, that's a remedy in the particular context of

14

bankruptcy.

15

And just to address, finally, the

16

government's broader argument about the sanctionability

17

of conduct outside bankruptcy.

18

held that it would be a violation of Rule 11 for a

19

plaintiff to file a complaint in the face of an obvious

20

defense, whether it's a limitations defense or some

21

other type of defense.

22

cursory analysis in the court of appeals' cases that

23

Respondent and the government cites, I would

24

respectfully submit that that would be an astonishing

25

proposition for civil litigants if this Court were to
