ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

Petitioner's brother obtained nearly

11

$270,000 in proceeds from the sales of Polar Pure.

12

Petitioner obtained nothing, yet the government seeks to

13

hold him jointly and severally liable for the entire

14

amount.

15

history, and purpose of Section 853.

16

That position contradicts the text, structure,

The government's position boils down to the

17

theory that even though Petitioner did not actually

18

obtain this money, he should be deemed to have obtained

19

it because his co-conspirator did based on supposed

20

background principles of conspiracy law.

21

background principles are both inconsistent with the

22

text of Section 853 and also do not apply on their own

23

terms.

24
25

But those

So to begin with our textual argument, I'd
like to focus on the structure of Section 853(a) because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

Section 853(a) enumerates three categories of property

2

subject to criminal forfeiture.

3

here, are proceeds obtained by the illegal activity;

4

853(a)(2) addresses the instrumentalities of crime; and

5

853(a)(3) addresses the criminal's interest in a

6

criminal enterprise.

7

853(a)(1), at issue

So we pointed out in our opening brief that

8

really joint-and-several liability doesn't make a lot of

9

sense as to 853(a)(2) and (a)(3), which supports the

10

inference that it also doesn't apply to (a)(1).

11

government's brief states, somewhat surprisingly in my

12

view, that, in fact, joint-and-several liability for

13

co-conspirators applies only as to (a)(1) and does not

14

apply as to (a)(2) and (a)(3).

15

government really has no textual basis at all so far as

16

we can discern.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the

But that position by the

But doesn't it seem that

18

there's some back and forth about what's new and what's

19

old in the government's theory, is that part of what's

20

changed in the government's theory or not?

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah.

That is one thing

22

that's changed.

23

think, two years ago where the government took the exact

24

opposite position and, in fact, persuaded the Third

25

Circuit to apply joint-and-several liability under

We quote a Third Circuit case from, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

(a)(2), which is one of the reasons we put this argument

2

in our brief.

3

But the government's change in position, I

4

just cannot reconcile it with the statute at all.

5

mean, the government's theory is that (a)(2) and (a)(3)

6

are somehow tied to ownership whereas (a)(1) is not, but

7

you cannot get that out of the statute.

8

three categories of property, and if (a)(2) and (a)(3)

9

are directed to ownership, then so is (a)(1).

I

It just lists

And

10

conversely, if the government was faithfully applying

11

its background principles, it would apply it to all

12

subsections of 853.

13

I mean, under the government's theory, if

14

one person obtains something, then they all do under

15

(a)(1).

16

person, say, uses a car in the conspiracy, they all do

17

and then there's forfeiture liability for everybody

18

under (a)(2).

19

distinction that the government has drawn here.

20

fact that the -- the government feels compelled to argue

21

one thing under (a)(1) and another under (a)(2) and

22

(a)(3), I think, shows that this is really a form of --

23

of common law criminal liability that's not required or

24

not authorized by the text.

25

Identical reasoning would require that if one

And so I just don't understand the
And the

I just want to say one word about (a)(3) in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

particular, which is about criminal enterprises

2

specifically.

3

defendant forfeits his interest in, only his interest in

4

the criminal enterprise, not the value of the enterprise

5

as a whole.

6

statute that requires the person only to forfeit the

7

interest he obtained, which we think is just totally

8

inconsistent with the government's theory than under

9

(a)(1), which says nothing about conspiracy liability.

10
11

That statute says that a criminal

That's a conspiracy-specific forfeiture

There's this hidden Pinkerton rule.
So another -- another argument we make has

12

to do with the rest of Section 853 as a whole, which

13

supports our view that really Section 853(a)(1) is

14

talking about forfeiture of tainted assets.

15

government's brief, again, they agree with this some --

16

surprisingly in our view.

17

853(a)(1) only requires a forfeiture of tainted assets,

18

which means there is no joint-and-several liability.

19

what the government has essentially admitted here is

20

that when one person obtains something, in fact, there

21

is no joint-and-several liability.

22

assets are subject to forfeiture, so only the person who

23

actually obtains it can forfeit it.

And in the

They say that yes, Section

So

Only the tainted

24

And, in fact, at the time that Section 853

25

was enacted, there was no substitute assets provision,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

so at that time, just there was no joint-and-several

2

liability at all, according to the new theory in the

3

government's brief which I haven't heard before.

4

So the government's theory is that

5

actually what opens the door to joint-and-several

6

liability is the separate substitute assets forfeiture

7

provision in 853(p).

8

whatsoever in the statutory text.

9

to just read Section 853(p).

But that just has no basis
I just ask the Court

What it says is, if based

10

on an act or omission of the defendant, property

11

described in Section 853(a)(1) is unavailable for a

12

series of enumerated reasons, then the government can

13

seek substitute forfeiture.

14

obvious what's that -- that's doing.

15

And I think it's just

What it's saying is that if the defendant

16

does something to thwart the forfeiture of the tainted

17

asset, then the court can go after the defendant's

18

substitute assets.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I suppose

20

their answer would be that under Pinkerton, when you're

21

talking about the defendant, you're also talking about

22

co-conspirators.

23

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, first of all,

24

the government doesn't make that argument in their brief

25

and actually I think it doesn't work.

Alderson Reporting Company

Because very

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

frequently, the dissipation of assets will not be

2

attributable to other co-conspirators under Pinkerton.

3

Suppose one person goes to Las Vegas and

4

gambles away the proceeds of a completed crime.

That

5

would not be in furtherance of the conspiracy.

To the

6

contrary, it would just expose the other conspirators to

7

liability, so --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what's your

authority for that proposition?

10

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -And under Pinkerton,

12

the -- the need to reach the substitute assets because

13

of dissipation wouldn't be attributed to the

14

co-conspirator.

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think that Pinkerton

16

itself includes a requirement that attribution requires

17

the act to be in furtherance of the conspiracy, so I

18

think the Court would have to ask the --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it's --

20

it -- in furtherance of the conspiracy, we're looking --

21

the act at issue here is dissipation of tainted assets

22

and the need for substitution.

23

in pursuance of the conspiracy as more as frustrating

24

the identification of the tainted assets.

25

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I don't know that that's

Well, that may be, but I --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

I think that when the text of Section 853(p) imposes a

2

requirement that specifically because of an act or

3

omission of the defendant, and that's what 853(p) says,

4

that is a prerequisite to obtain forfeiture against the

5

defendant, I think the government either has to show

6

that that's -- the defendant did something to -- to

7

cause the property to be unavailable, which the

8

government hasn't shown and -- and can't necessarily

9

show in general, or that the act that triggers the

10

substitute forfeiture, which is the dissipation, is

11

attributable to co-conspirators, which the government

12

doesn't think it has to prove and hasn't proved here.

13

And I point out on the facts of this case,

14

there's no showing of unavailability.

15

is that the government agreed to a plea deal with the

16

brother in which he would only forfeit a subset of all

17

of the -- the tainted assets.

18

those assets are just in a bank account somewhere.

19

the government hasn't even tried to prove the

20

requirements that it claims opened the door to

21

joint-and-several liability.

22

All that happened

And so as far as we know,
So

So I -- I think that the reason the

23

government's theory doesn't work is that it's just

24

inconsistent with these background principles, because

25

we just think that the relevant background principles

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

are the ones governing, number one, forfeiture, and

2

number two, sentencing, and neither of those background

3

principles attributable in either of those areas support

4

joint-and-several liability.

5

So first as to forfeiture, as I think the

6

government agrees, the relevant historical tradition is

7

in rem forfeiture and there's just no concept of

8

joint-and-several liability there.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have just a practical

question.

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
Would our -- how would

13

our ruling here affect the RICO forfeiture statute,

14

1963?

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

So --

similar.

18

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

The language is very

Yes.

So -So if we rule in your

favor, does that mean we undo the RICO statute as well?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think there's a pretty

22

good likelihood of that.

23

is very similar.

24

some other structural difference.

25

the government would come up with a way to distinguish

I mean, I admit the language

I -- I haven't studied whether there's

Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I would guess

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

this case if it lost this case, but I -- I don't know

2

what that is for sure, but it -- it is true that the

3

language is very similar.

4

Honor.

5

I -- I acknowledge that, Your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

RICO may be easier to

6

prove the joint-and-several concept because RICO is an

7

enterprise as defined.

8
9

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

That -- that is true.

So

it -- the language in the forfeiture provision is -- is

10

similar, but it -- it may be that some background aspect

11

of RICO or some structural textual argument that doesn't

12

apply here might apply.

13

issue specifically, and I'm sure that the government

14

will probably come up with some theory if -- if it

15

doesn't prevail today.

16

But I -- I haven't studied that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how would this work --

17

how would your rule work as a practical matter in a drug

18

conspiracy case or a racketeering case where the

19

government can prove that a certain amount of money was

20

taken in by the conspiracy over a period of time and

21

then it was divide -- presumably, it was divided up in

22

some way among the members of the conspiracy and -- do

23

they have to show how much each of them got?

24

they're not going to do this by check.

25

to be by cash.

I mean,

It's all going

So how -- how could that work as a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

practical matter?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that

3

Section 853(d) solves at least some of the government's

4

problems in this area, which is this presumption that if

5

you get money during the conspiracy and there's no other

6

likely source, it's attributable to the conspiracy.

7

the way that would work in practice is suppose a bunch

8

of money comes into a conspiracy, and there's no

9

specific records of how it's distributed, but one day a

10

conspirator buys a yacht or something, or buys a new

11

car.

12

So

So the presumption in Section 853(d) allows

13

the court to presume that the car is tainted.

14

subject -- it's, you know, it's because of the -- the

15

tainted money, even without a direct proof that a check

16

was given, which I agree will not typically happen.

17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's

Did the government ever

try to invoke (d) here?

19

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, Your Honor, there --

20

there's no record of that at all.

21

entire theory in this case has been this pure

22

joint-and-several liability, because this conspirator --

23

co-conspirator obtained the money, she also obtained the

24

money.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The government's

And what do you do in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

situation that's similar to what I just -- I just

2

described, where members of the conspiracy have -- have

3

spent a lot of money.

4

or another, so they don't have a yacht or some asset

5

that can be -- can be identified, but it's clear that

6

they had -- they had a lot of money and they spent a lot

7

of money.

8
9

They've dissipated it in one way

Then what happens?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that, first of

all, Section 853 has several powerful tools to determine

10

how much each person obtained.

11

depositions, there's asset freezes, there's a bunch of

12

other things.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

You can take

Oh, come on.

You're going

14

to take a, you know, a deposition of somebody, a

15

mid-level person in a drug -- in a drug enterprise:

16

much did you get per week?

17

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

How

Well, no, but if you have

18

evidence the person spent money somewhere, you can go to

19

the place where he allegedly spent the money and try to

20

figure out how much he spent.

21

Yes, it's true, I can't -- I can't deny that

22

there's probably some category of cases where forfeiture

23

will be harder under our rule than the government's

24

rule, and we think that's just part and parcel of the

25

statute that requires forfeiture of tainted property

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

except as certain substrate assets are met.

2

you -- if you repeal the obtained element, and the

3

government is essentially asking for a judicial repeal

4

of obtained element, then obviously, in cases where it's

5

hard to prove the obtaining, the government will have an

6

easier time winning.

7

way that the Court should construe the statute.

8
9

I mean, if

But I just don't think that's the

In terms of background principle, so we
already talk about forfeiture, how there's no background

10

principle of -- of joint-and-several liability in

11

forfeiture.

12

because the government is essentially saying that a

13

forfeiture, which is by statute a component of a

14

sentence, is joint-and-several in the sense that one

15

person's payment will decrease another person's payment,

16

and that's just never the way sentencing has worked,

17

either in criminal sentences or fines.

18

I think the same is true with sentencing,

So we point out that Walter and Daniel

19

Pinkerton, it's true that they were substantively liable

20

for crimes committed by their co-conspirator, but had

21

individual fines and individual sentences.

22

just part of the traditional principle of sentencing,

23

that it's tied to an individual's culpability.

24

doesn't make sense that one person's payment would be

25

reduced based on someone else's plea agreement, because

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's

So it

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

that's not tied to his own personal culpability.

2

So in that sense, joint-and-several

3

liability is inconsistent with background principles,

4

too.

5

isn't the application of background principles.

6

think that's the deeper point in this case.

7

this joint-and-several liability issue has never come

8

up, ever, in the context of conspiracy law.

9

And I think the overarching point is this really
And I

Because

So what the government is doing is saying

10

that it thinks it makes sense as a matter of policy to

11

apply those background principles from very different

12

contexts to forfeiture law, but altered in different

13

ways.

14

applies to some sections but not others, and that is

15

just not the way the Court has read criminal statutes.

16
17
18

So there's joint-and-several liability; it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It does have a number of

courts -- courts of appeals on its side, doesn't it?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

That is certainly true, and

19

the split does favor the government, we agree.

20

there's a lot of different ways we point out in our

21

reply brief where the government's positions in this

22

case actually diverge to some extent from lower courts.

23

But

And in fact, just one very recent

24

development I would raise to the Court's attention.

25

point out on page 8 of reply brief that the government's

Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

position is -- in this brief is inconsistent with its

2

position in a pending case in the court of appeals.

3

after I filed my reply brief a couple days ago, the

4

government actually went ahead and confessed error in

5

that appeal, even though it's fully briefed and argued,

6

and I believe had won in the district court.

So

7

So I commend the government for doing that.

8

I -- I truly believe it acted in the utmost good faith.

9

And my point is that the fact the government feels

10

compelled to confess error days before a Supreme Court

11

argument in the court of appeals is in some tension, in

12

my view, with this view that there's this stable body of

13

law that the Court should just be ratifying.

14

that's just not --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think

Is there any -- any

16

circuit case on the other side, other than the D.C.

17

Circuit case?

18

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

No, Your Honor.

There's a

19

district court opinion by Judge Thapar called Solomon

20

which we quote in our brief, which we think is quite

21

persuasive, at least on the reasoning.

22

no other court of appeals decision other than

23

Cano-Flores, which is found in favor of our position.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But no, there's

Is there -- is there any

indication in the text of 853 that those who framed that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

and adopted it had conspiracy in mind?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think so, yes.

I mean,

3

Section 853(a)(3) is about criminal enterprises, and --

4

which is a form of conspiracy.

5

states that you only forfeit your share of the criminal

6

enterprise.

7

subsection, Congress did have at least one form of

8

conspiracy in mind.

9

under that provision, joint-and-several liability does

10

And that subsection

So I think that at least as to that

And the government agrees that

not apply.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is a -- a bit off

12

topic, but the statute refers to proceeds that the

13

person obtained directly or indirectly.

14
15

Do you have a view as to what that
"indirectly" is doing there and what it encompasses?

16

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah.

So, for instance, I

17

think this case is a perfect illustration of what it

18

encompasses.

19

obtain it.

20

the corporation that he owned and controlled.

21

fact, there's been several court of appeals cases in

22

which people have held to have indirectly obtained money

23

when it flows to a corporation that ultimately are

24

controlling the money.

25

indirectly obtained.

So petitioner's brother did not personally
I think the ownership interest was through
And in

So that's one example of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

Another example would be if, say, you know,

2

petitioner said, well, I want to pay for my -- my son's

3

college or my daughter's college education, and someone

4

says, okay, well, I'll pay towards that rather than pay

5

to you.

6

of getting the benefit of the money without actually

7

getting it directly.

8
9

That might be indirectly obtained in the sense

So I can't claim to provide a full text on
any of -- all the situations in which someone could have

10

indirectly obtained something, but I think the

11

fundamental distinction in this case is between

12

indirectly obtaining and just not obtaining it, which we

13

think is the facts of this case.

14
15

If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The law treats conspiracy as a partnership

23

in crime, and for that reason it has long been the rule

24

that the acts of every member of the conspiracy in

25

furtherance of the common plan are attributed to every

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19

other member of the conspiracy.

the foundation for the familiar Pinkerton rule of

3

substantive criminal liability, that as we explain in

4

our brief, that same insight, the attribution of the

5

acts of one conspirator to all of the other

6

co-conspirators, also controls the law's treatment of

7

conspirators in various other contexts.

8
9

And that's obviously

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that,

Pinkerton, it -- it's based on a fiction, right?

I

10

mean -- I mean, the defendant may not have been there

11

when the acts committed; somebody else may have done it,

12

but because he's a conspirator, you treat it as if he

13

had done that.

14

I'm not sure that that theory works when

15

you're talking about a more focused statute here, where

16

you tamper only the tainted property.

17

sure that that works, because as soon as you engage in

18

a -- that fiction, it takes the focus tainted

19

requirement away.

20

MR. FLETCHER:

And I'm not quite

So I -- I -- I disagree,

21

Mr. Chief Justice.

22

think this has gotten confused, this broader issue of

23

tainted versus untainted property and how that maps onto

24

our view of conspiracy liability.

25

brief confuses our position on that, and I don't fault

And I'd like to explain, because I

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the reply

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

my -- my friend for that, but I'd just like to lay out

2

our -- our understanding how it works.

3

Section 853(a)(1) makes the forfeitable

4

proceeds the tainted property or tainted proceeds the

5

forfeitable property.

6

a bunch of drugs, they do a drug deal and they get a

7

duffel bag full of cash, the proceeds -- the property

8

constituting the proceeds that's forfeitable under

9

(a)(1) is the duffel bag full of cash.

So if you have two guys who sell

And if the

10

police catch them on way back home after the

11

transaction, those specific proceeds are forfeitable.

12

And that's what the government has to seize, and that's

13

what's forfeitable under 853(a)(1).

14

And in that circumstance, I didn't say they

15

are both liable for the forfeiture.

16

doesn't have to prove which of them is responsible for

17

the cash.

18

in terms of joint-and-several liability, because

19

joint-and-several liability is a concept in law that

20

comes into play only when a person is entitled to

21

recover some sum of money and it can collect that sum

22

from anyone.

23

The government

But it doesn't make sense to talk about that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -- if they both

24

have -- was carrying it, they both have the duffle bag

25

and all that, and you say, well, they are both liable

for what's in the duffel bag.

2

takes the duffel bag and, you know, buys a car with it.

3

And your theory is the other guy is responsible for the

4

value of the car.

5
6

MR. FLETCHER:

But then one of them

Right.

But very often

when --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And your theory also

8

is if the other guy, you know, just dropped the person

9

off, had nothing to do with getting the duffel bag or

10

whatever, the same thing happens.

11

responsible to forfeit the value of the car.

MR. FLETCHER:

He's still

If it's foreseeable to him,

13

yes.

14

sense.

15

situation where you still have the duffel bag, you still

16

have the traceable proceeds, that's what's forfeitable.

17

If you're not in that situation anymore, if, as is

18

usually the case by the time drug defendants or RICO

19

defendants are caught, it's been dissipated, it's been

20

commingled, it's somehow unavailable, that's the garden

21

variety, typical case.

And -- and let me explain why I think that makes
It's because if you find -- if you're in the

And there's some

I'm -- I'm happy to talk about that.

2

purposes of the question presented in this case,

everyone agrees that the government is entitled to get

4

that value of the dissipated proceeds.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

But I think for

So do you have to show one

of these five preconditions in (p)?

7

MR. FLETCHER:

To invoke (p), (p) is a

8

procedure that allows the government to for -- forfeit

9

specific substitute assets in a defendant's hands, a car

10

or a house, something like that.

11

going to invoke (p), the government has to show what the

12

one of those five preconditions for (p) has been

13

satisfied.

14

If the government is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As to one person,

15

though, not to the other.

16

if the chauffeur who drives the -- the kingpin around

17

and therefore is going to be a co -- a co-conspirator.

18

And the kingpin does, you know gets the drug money,

19

decides to buy a Ferrari with it, then sells it.

20

has the cash.

21

In other words, if we have --

And he

But you can get that cash from the

22

chauffeur.

23

Because he's a co-conspirator in Pinkerton, he is

24

considered to have obtained what anybody else had

25

obtained.

You don't have to trace it to him somehow.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

MR. FLETCHER:

That's correct.

If you were

2

in a situation where the traceable proceeds aren't

3

available, then you're in a joint-and-several liability

4

situation --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Listen, I wonder why

6

you call them traceable.

7

applies even if there -- you don't have to show that

8

they're traceable.

9

traceable, he used the drug money to buy the Ferrari,

I -- oh, I think your theory

I mean, if you can show they're

10

are you saying that then the co-conspirators, the

11

chauffeur, is not liable for those proceeds?

12

MR. FLETCHER:

If the Ferrari's wouldn't --

13

if the government has the ability to forfeit the --

14

Ferrari still falls under subsection 853(a)(1) it's

15

property -- any proceeds the person obtained directly or

16

directly or indirectly and that property derived from

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the government can actually show the

But -- but it's odd that

22

you use P, which would apply to substitute property --

23

you apply it even though this particular defendant or

24

the particular person did nothing himself to place the

25

proceeds beyond the reach of -- of the court.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

MR. FLETCHER:

That's right.

And I think

2

the reason why we would do that when (p) comes into

3

play, and I want to get back to an answer to Justice

4

Kagan's question -- we don't think only way the

5

government can recover this -- value of dissipated

6

proceeds is by invoking P, but when (p) does come into

7

play and when the government is seeking to rely on that,

8

it relies on the same principles of attribution that the

9

Chief Justice's question suggested earlier, that your

10

liable as a member of a conspiracy, not only through

11

your co-conspirators act in obtaining the proceeds, but

12

also for any act dissipation of those proceeds.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So in other words you're

14

saying, the defendant in (p) is the same as the person

15

in A and both includes co-conspirators as well as the

16

actual defendant or person?

17

MR. FLETCHER:

I think we agree with the

18

result.

19

The person described as the defendant before the court,

20

is the person for the court, under Pinkerton principles

21

though that persons' is responsible for it.

co-contributors are attributed to him as a matter of

JUSTICE BREYER: Where --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is -Where does it say that?

6

mean -- I didn't take that point -- you're saying the

7

word "property"

I

in A1 is the tainted property.

8

MR. FLETCHER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
Okay.

And so the defendant

10

is liable for the tainted property.

11

him circumstances where he's liable for other than the

12

tainted property.

And then (p) gives

All right.

13

MR. FLETCHER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
And it doesn't say in A1

15

that a person who doesn't have the tainted property is

16

liable in an equivalent amount.

17

that outside those circumstances the person is liable

18

for an equivalent amount.

19

20

and there was no way to get the money from a person who

21

didn't actually have it because you had to have the

24

in A, and indeed congress, said when they passed this

25

that these are exhaustive, we want -- we're not adding

It doesn't say in (p)

It doesn't say in common law

It doesn't say it in P.

So there's no common

Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't say it

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

to anything, we're trying to make it exhaustive.

2

just where in the statute does it give you the authority

3

to draw the conclusion that you're drawing?

So

4

MR. FLETCHER:

5

Both of them rely on background principles

I think in two ways:

6

of conspiracy liability, but they do so in slightly

7

different ways.

8

the text of subsection (a) in light of the background

9

principle of conspiracy liability that informs Pinkerton

And so the first one is just to read

10

and everything else.

11

to forfeit any property constituting or derived from any

12

proceeds the person obtained directly or indirectly.

13

So when it says, a person liable

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here the person didn't

14

obtain it in any odd common English thing until you're

15

saying -- that word "obtained" means is property he

16

didn't obtain.

17

MR. FLETCHER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice Breyer -Co-conspirators came and

19

you say let's look to the common law and the common law

20

made that argument impossible because if you look to the

21

history of it as I said you had to have the property

22

itself in an in rem proceeding, so that's why I asked

23

the question.

24
25

MR. FLETCHER:

I -- I understand the

question, but emphasize every single application of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

Pinkerton principle to a substantive crime is atextual

2

and would be subject to exactly the same criticism.

3

in a closely related context here, 21 U.S.C. 841(a)

4

makes it unlawful for any person to distribute a

5

controlled substance, and subsection (b) says any person

6

who violates subsection (a) can be sentenced.

7

all of the time the term was undisputed.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

So

And yet

Oh yeah, that's why I

mentioned the fact -- if -- if you go back into the
history.

11

MR. FLETCHER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- of the forfeiture, it's

13

quite different from that.

14

forfeiture was you had to have the property itself and

15

certainly if we're looking to history and tradition,

16

history and tradition are the one thing when you're

17

talking about criminal liability and it seems to me,

18

which is why I asked, quite the opposite.

19

talking about forfeiture.

20

MR. FLETCHER:

The history of the

When you're

So the tradition that you're

21

reforming to is a long tradition of civil in rem

22

forfeiture that this Court has discussed in many

23

opinions, and I think the statute before you today is

24

very self-conscious departure from that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, finish

your answer.
MR. FLETCHER:

I was just going to say, in

6

two ways both in the terms of what's forfeitable,

7

proceeds forfeiture was new in 1970 and criminal and

8

pursuant forfeiture was also new when it was enacted in

9

RICO statutes.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand the

11

idea you argued this is not in rem, but when you -- as

12

soon as you say, but we're only after the tainted

13

property, it kind of sounds like you're in rem under

14

another label.

15

this piece of property, just as if you were proceeding

16

in an action against --

In other words, you're sticking with

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.
-- in rem against

not -- not in rem, but we're only going after the

forfeitable, and this Court knows from Luis, there are

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. --

MR. FLETCHER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm having trouble with

13

just one component of your argument, many, but one that

14

for the moment, which is the one that led the -- the one

15

court who's against --

16

MR. FLETCHER:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yeah.
-- on this this issue

18

was the courier who receives 50 dollars a week or 50

19

dollars a trip to deliver drugs.

20

MR. FLETCHER: Yes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Under your theory that

22

courier who on everyone facts doesn't see more than 50

23

dollars of whatever the profit is of this drug

24

enterprise, that courier is responsible for a million

25

dollars, 2 million dollars, 3 million dollars criminal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

conspiracy because he took an undisputedly small part.

2

Now, assume what logic in -- in rem theory would ever

3

make a person who's never obtaining that money, those

4

proceeds responsible for the larger sum?

5

MR. FLETCHER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Someone -Why should the drug

7

dealer, who in fact got all of the money, minus 50

8

dollars, why should he be off-the-hook for even a penny

9

less than what he put in his pocket because the courier

10

happened to have a hundred dollars saved?

11

MR. FLETCHER:

So I want to start with the

12

courier and explain that the limits of the courier's

13

liability are going to be the scope of the Pinkerton

14

principle the scope of the conspiracy that he agreed to

15

join, and the proceeds that were reasonably foreseeable

16

to him.

17

from -- from proceeds of a drug transaction under our

18

theory unless under Pinkerton, he could be convicted and

19

sent to jail for the act of carrying out the

20

transaction.

And so he can't be held liable for forfeiture

It -- it doesn't extend an inch further --

MR. FLETCHER:

25

Well --

does.

MR. FLETCHER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and -And for those that are

reasonably within the scope of the conspiracy.
MR. FLETCHER:

And -- and the only point

6

that I'm making, and I don't think it's disagreeing with

7

anything that Your Honor has said, is just -- that we

8

don't think it's a great leap to say that once you're in

9

a conspiracy that has consequences for your liability

10
11
12
13
14
15
16

one of them is that you can be convicted for the crimes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You'll serve a lot of
years in jail.

20

to mean against the proceeds of the crime.

MR. FLETCHER:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're getting a remedy

23

that's literally unheard of in the background principles

of forfeiture.

So, it depends on what you

mean by similar concept of law. I -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Concept where you're

11

going to be personally liable for something greater than

12

what you directly obtained.

13

MR. FLETCHER:

So I think one is the

14

restitution context, we point out that the criminal

15

defendants are held jointly and severally liable to pay

16

restitution to victims, that's now specifically

17

authorized by statute as we explain in our brief.

18

Courts of appeals applied the same

19

background principles we're invoking here to reach that

20

result even before that.

21

I also want to emphasize, Justice Sotomayor,

22

that some of your question and some -- I think a lot of

23

the appeal of Mr. Unikowsky's argument comes from the --

24

that the alternative to the rule that we're asking you

25

to endorse that's prevailed in nine circuits for, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

some cases decades, is a scheme in which the only thing

2

that a courier or a conspirator is required to forfeit

3

are the proceeds that he actually has or that he somehow

4

got to enjoy for himself, and that is not the law.

5

That's not the -- the statute has not been enacted --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May -- may I,

7

Mr. Fletcher, go back to your saying now this is in

8

personam no longer in rem, but in -- in personam

9

generally, it would be a right of contribution.

And I

10

take it under your theory, suppose the brother who was

11

merely the employee of the shop, as the government goes

12

after that brother for the $269,000, and so the brother

13

who owns the store is now off the hook.

14

that the government went after would have no right of

contribution.

is -- is -- can -- can go home free if the government

defendant and say we'll forget the forfeiture in your

case.

MR. FLETCHER:

that someone could seek contribution under State law.

But I just want to emphasize I -- I don't

3

think that's a anomalous result, because as we point out

in our brief, the traditional rule was that tort --

did not have a right of contribution if they committed

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, under your

theory, if it worked the other way around, if they went

would then, under your theory, have a right of

14

contribution against the brother who got nothing.

15

That's -- that's your theory.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

No.

Our theory is that there

17

isn't -- I'm saying I agree, there isn't a right of

18

contribution, that it's joint-and-several liability.

principles if -- as I said, I'm not aware of any State

most of the time people who are -- this comes up in

12

cases where defendants are prosecuted together, and so

13

the -- the question is if any of them have it, the

14

government's going to have it available to the

15

government.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So really you're only saying

17

it has to be unavailable as to Conspirator B.

18

not have to prove that it's unavailable as to

19

Conspirator A.

20

Conspirator A's bank account, it doesn't matter.

21

long as you can't get it through Conspirator B, you can

22

go after B for -- for substitute assets.

23

You do

You could know that it's in

MR. FLETCHER:

I think that's right.

24

I want to be candid, I'm not aware of a case that

25

addresses the question.

As

Though

You could disagree with me

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

about that and not disagree with me about what the

2

rule ought to be.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So then let's --

4

let's leave that to -- let's bracket that.

5

B, who you do have in front of you, you started by

6

talking a little bit about this -- this (p) section.

7

you have to prove that one of these five preconditions

8

in (p) is satisfied?

9

MR. FLETCHER:

Then as to

Do

In order to forfeit

10

substitute property under (p), and -- and -- before you

11

continue, I just want to put on the table that our view

12

is the government doesn't have to invoke (p).

13

also obtain a forfeiture money judgment if the directly

14

forfeitable property isn't available.

15
16
17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

It can

I'm curious about

that, but first let's talk about (b) -- (p).
MR. FLETCHER:

Sure.

Yes.

If -- if you're

18

trying to forfeit substitute assets under (p), (p) has

19

requirements; you have to show that one of five of them

20

is -- is satisfied.

21
22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And have -- have you shown

that in this case?

23

MR. FLETCHER:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. FLETCHER:

I believe that we have, yes.
Which one?
I believe that we've shown, I

exercise of -- of diligence and has been commingled.

7

Cannot be located upon the

And I -- I want -- I just want to emphasize
because -JUSTICE KAGAN:

And when you say that you've

shown that, what do you mean?
MR. FLETCHER:

What I mean is that in --

8

this is the -- the understanding which the case was

9

litigated in district court.

The government came in and

10

sought a money judgment and there was no mystery about

11

what the rules were.

12

defendant's forfeiture memorandum in the district court.

13

It appears as Document Number 107 on the district court

14

docket, and this is on page 2 quoting from a Sixth

15

Circuit decision.

16

I want to quote to you from the

And it says:

"Where the government is

17

unable to recover the actual property that is subject to

18

forfeiture, the government can seek a money judgment for

19

an amount equal to the value of the property that

20

constitutes the proceeds of the drug violation."

21

Now, Petitioner could have argued that the

22

prerequisites for seeking a money judgment weren't

23

satisfied, either because we can't get money judgments

24

and have to go through (p), or if we do have to go

25

through (p), that we hadn't satisfied those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

prerequisites.

2

we could have on these facts, but Petitioner didn't make

3

those arguments.

4

We could have made the showing; I think

The only argument that Petitioner made

5

that's relevant to the question presented here is that

6

he couldn't be held jointly and severally liable on a

7

money judgment.

8

court adopted --

9

That's the argument that the district

JUSTICE BREYER:

But in both of these in

10

your answers, I take it, it happens to say, and we

11

have -- we're trying B.

12

trying B who's gotten nothing.

And A is around, but we're

13

MR. FLETCHER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.

Yeah.

Now, it says you can use

15

853(p) if the property described in subsection (a), as a

16

result of any act or omission of the defendant.

17

MR. FLETCHER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Now, it wasn't the act or

19

omission of the defendant.

20

money, who hid it, who went to Mexico, et cetera.

21

you're saying you still can get it from B.

22

your reasoning is somehow these words, am I right, in

23

(a), "Any property constituted or derived from any

24

proceeds the person obtained," okay, you say that

25

includes money that his co-conspirator obtained because

It was A who mixed the

But

And I guess

MR. FLETCHER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Okay.

If that's so, I just

want to be sure.

5

which is called protective orders, I suppose on your

6

theory that we have five people in a conspiracy, two,

7

three are couriers, you know, they were found somewhere

8

on a beach and they drove a truck and they have nothing,

9

or they only each have about a thousand -- no, not

When we get to -- when we get to (e),

10

nothing, but a hundred thousand dollars, and then we

11

have A and B, who were the leaders and they have about

12

10 million.

13

So on your theory of protective orders, you

14

issue a protective order against all their assets, all

15

five, and they can't hire lawyers, a matter which is a

16

different issue, I understand, they can't hire lawyers.

17

They may have to pay, even though the money is way over

18

there with A and B.

19

can't even hire lawyers on your theory.

20
21

I mean, it does bother me that they

MR. FLETCHER:

The -- but I want to be

emphatic, that's not the result of our theory.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. FLETCHER:

Why not?
Because, as we explain in our

24

brief on pages 35 and 36, subsection (c) and (e), which

25

deal with pretrial restraints and relation back are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

limited to the property described in subsection (a) --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. FLETCHER:

Uh-huh.
-- in the hands of either a

4

particular defendant in a nonconspiracy case or when

5

you're dealing with conspirators, that is our position

6

is specific tainted property.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, suddenly

8

it seems to me we've switched meaning here, because now

9

we're talking about the bag of money.

Now, does the

10

word "property" -- the bag of money in A, mean the bag

11

of money and not the substitute in B's bank account,

12

which has never seen the light of day in any crime, or

13

doesn't it?

14

MR. FLETCHER:

I think the specific property

15

described in A is the bag full of money.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. FLETCHER:

Okay.
But A in the statute serves

18

two functions.

19

That property is forfeitable if the government can find

20

it.

21

can't find it, that property fixes the amount of the

22

government's entitlement to recover forfeiture --

23

It describes that specific property.

But if, as is usually the case, the government

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you're able to do that

24

under what statute?

25

ah, you see the last clauses here, I could follow in a

You see, everything until you said

statute.

2

exclusive.

A statute that Congress said this is pretty

3

Now --

4

MR. FLETCHER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- it's only the things

6

following that qualification that I can't find in any

7

statute.

8
9

MR. FLETCHER:

So one way that we can

definitely do that is through the substitute assets

10

provision in Section 853(p).

11

you can apply the same principles of attributed

12

liability to a co-conspirator's act of dealing in cash

13

or laundering proceeds or otherwise --

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

As we explain, we think

But (p) unfortunately says

because of an act or omission --

16

MR. FLETCHER:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of the defendant.
-- of the defendant, and

18

then it adds, if act or omission of the defendant in, I

19

think, respect to property described in (a).

20

MR. FLETCHER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.
All right.

Now, is -- is

22

this mysterious bank account which never saw the light

23

of day within (a) or isn't it?

24
25

Now, it sounds to me, and I'm not -- it does
honestly sound that way, sometimes you seem to say yes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1
2

and sometimes you seem to say no.
MR. FLETCHER:

Justice Breyer, I -- I

3

apologize if I'm not being clear.

4

that if the -- the -- let's take it back to the very

5

simple example where it's a drug deal that's done and

6

the proceeds are a duffel bag full of cash.

7

property described in (a).

8

forfeitable under (a).

9

that property is gone and not available, the government

I think our view is

That's the

That's the property that's

But if, as is usually the case,

10

can recover its value.

11

is through (p).

12

my friend mentioned, (p) didn't come into the statute

13

until later, it came in in 1986.

14

was enacted in 1984.

15

defendants made the argument, because the property

16

described in (a) are the traceable proceeds, if I've

17

hidden the proceeds, if I've dissipated them, if you

18

can't find them when you convict them, you can't hold me

19

liable for a forfeiture.

20

One way that it can to do that

Another way that it can do that is, as

The original statute

And under the original statute,

Can you go over?

Can you

but if I pay it over to the government I won't have a

So let's take our shopkeeping -He says:

Yeah, I have $60,000,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

MR. FLETCHER:

So in a pretrial world, the

2

government can't stop him from using -- pay -- using his

3

funds to pay for a lawyer if those funds are untainted.

4

Section 853(e) is the provision that allows pretrial

5

restraints.

6

that that does not apply to untainted assets.

7

We explained it's the government's position

That was the position of the majority of the

8

courts of appeal, but as my friend pointed out, the

9

Fourth Circuit had a different rule.

The government

10

filed a brief in a case in the Fourth Circuit that took

11

a position that was consistent with circuit precedent

12

but inconsistent with the position we took in our brief

13

here, and we've now withdrawn that and asked Fourth

14

Circuit to remand.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in terms of

16

the -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the substitution

17

principle doesn't apply with respect to assets that you

18

can seize that are needed for counsel fees?

19

MR. FLETCHER:

The substitution principle

20

doesn't apply because -- that's -- that's right,

21

exactly.

22

conceding that this is the right reading of the statute,

23

is that (p) describes substitute assets, (e) refers only

24

to property that's described in subsection (a), and

25

that's the specific tainted proceeds.

The courts can address the issue, and we're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

I -- I want to come back, if I could -- to,

2

Justice Kagan, you've asked questions about indirectly

3

to my friend, and I actually think that's another way

4

to -- it's the other way to read the statute to get to

5

our result, which is that everyone agrees that this

6

statute requires the forfeiture of proceeds that a

7

defendant does not obtain personally, that he obtains

8

indirectly.

9

And some of the examples that my friend

10

gives are, if the proceeds go to a closely-held

11

corporation or to a lawful partnership or something like

12

that.

13

courts of appeals' decisions -- is they were

14

particularly odd to depart from the traditional

15

principle that one member of a conspiracy is liable for

16

the acts of the other members of the conspiracy in a

17

context in which the statute invites forfeiture of

18

proceeds that a person doesn't obtain personally.

And our view -- and this is reflected in the

19

Because the law regards a conspiracy as a

20

partnership where all members are partners and act as

21

each other's agents.

22

leap to say, as the court of appeals have done,

23

indirectly obtain proceeds when the criminal enterprise

24

of which you are a part obtains those proceeds, and the

25

government doesn't have to show how the funds traced

And we don't think it's any great

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

through the conspiracy and who actually ended up with

2

how much, because you're all fairly regarded as

3

indirectly obtaining the proceeds that were obtained by

4

the conspiracy as a whole.

5

The other point I want to make is --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

Mr. Fletcher, if I could,

I'm awfully sorry --

8

MR. FLETCHER:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Oh, no.
-- but let's just take

10

the -- the -- the case where there are these two

11

conspirators and one takes the cash and it's in his

12

basement.

13

right?

14

judgments, since I don't understand really how that

15

works, so let's just focus on (p).

16

But the other one is the one before you,

And let's put aside the extrastatutory money

All right?

Now, do you -- you said you don't have to --

17

you don't have to show that it's really unavailable.

18

You just have to show that it's unavailable as to the

19

conspirator before you.

20
21
22

MR. FLETCHER:

Unavailable to be forfeited

in the proceeding before the court.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

Yes.
And then how do you

23

show that these (p) conditions have been met as to that

24

particular person?

25

proceeds, so which acts could he have taken that

In other words, he never had the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1
2

dissipate the proceeds under (p)?
MR. FLETCHER:

Because the (p) conditions

3

aren't focused so much on the -- on the person; they're

4

focused on rendering the property unavailable.

5

question is --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

So the

But it -But there is nothing -But it begins by saying

act or omission of the defendant.
MR. FLETCHER:

Correct.

Yes.

But our view

11

is that the defendant is accountable for the acts of his

12

co-conspirators --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you just said that the

14

other conspirator might not have dissipated them at all.

15

They're sitting in his basement.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

So I think, in that case,

17

Justice Kagan, I think our view would be we could make

18

the showing under (p) that they are unavailable to the

19

government, because in this case, presumably, the

20

government -- the government doesn't know that they're

21

sitting in the other conspirator's basement, because if

22

the government did, they'd be prosecuting that guy and

23

attempting --

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. FLETCHER:

You have --

-- to recover the proceeds

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

from him.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have your choice

3

of getting the money either from the guy who is holding

4

it in the basement, or from the other guy.

5

can choose.

6

recovering from the, whatever it is, the chauffeur, the

7

bag man, to show that the money is not available from

8

the kingpin.

9

Right?

You

It's not -- it's not a precondition for you

MR. FLETCHER:

The question is, is it

10

available to be forfeited in the -- in the proceeding in

11

court.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if it's only a

13

proceeding against the one guy, you can get the money

14

from him, even though the money is sitting in a bag in

15

the kingpin's basement.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

17

But I -- I just -- I want to be clear --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.

Yes.

And even though you can't

19

show that -- this is why I keep on coming back to the

20

preconditions of (p).

21

particular act or omission that led to the dissipation

22

of the assets in these particular five ways.

23

You really can't show a

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, if that's the case,

24

Justice Kagan, you might disagree with me about how to

25

read (p), and if you read (p) that way in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

hypothetical you just described, then that defendant

2

would have an argument the government couldn't invoke

3

(p) as to him.

4

But I really think a lot of the discussion

5

that we've had about how (p) works and how money

6

judgments works are really ancillary.

7

question presented, to be sure, but they are not the

8

question presented.

9

litigated and as it comes to the Court, there's no

They inform the

The question, as this case has been

10

question that the government can get a money judgment.

11

There's no question that it can proceed through

12

substitute assets if it can invoke (p).

13

The question is who has liability for the

14

amount, and the rule that was reflected in the decision

15

below and the rule that we think is correct is that when

16

the government is in that decision where the traceable

17

proceeds are gone and it's trying to recover the value

18

of the proceeds, how is that liability allocated amongst

19

the conspirators.

20

traditional principles of conspiracy liability, the

21

correct measure is the amount that was foreseeable to

22

each conspirator.

23

And we think, in accordance with

Because the alternative -- and this gets

24

back to the point I made to Justice Sotomayor, or was

25

starting to about couriers -- is that you're going to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50

sticking people with liability based on the amount of

2

money that they touched.

3

money they got to enjoy or spend or ultimately keep;

4

it's the amount of money they obtained.

5

person sells drugs, he obtains the whole proceeds of the

6

transaction and then passes it along to somebody else,

7

he can be held liable for that entire amount even though

8

he didn't keep all that much of it.

9

It's not just the amount of

And so when a

That's reflected in the Casey case which we

10

cite in our brief, and also in Judge Boudeen's opinion

11

in Hurley.

forfeiture liability depend on the amount that was

13

foreseeable to the defendant is a more sensible way to

14

allocate the monetary penalty in Section 853.

And we think a system that instead makes

Mr. Unikowsky, 15 minutes.

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd like to begin by responding to counsel's

22

comments about how this case was litigated below, and

23

then I'd like to say a few words about the textual

24

arguments as well as the background principles.

25

So first, in terms of how this case was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

litigated below, the way the government has litigated

2

this case throughout was its theory that Section

3

853(a)(1), and specifically the word "obtain," was

4

enough to establish joint-and-several liability.

5

what the government has said is that it uses the word

6

"obtained," and that simply means that that imputes

7

everyone in the conspiracy and that's enough to

8

establish Petitioner's liability for forfeiture of any

9

amount that was not actually forfeited from Petitioner's

10

So

brother.

11

And so we have always taken the position,

12

consistently through that litigation -- throughout this

13

litigation, excuse me, that that's the wrong reading of

14

Section 853(a)(1).

15

"obtained" refers to assets that you actually got.

16

you can't forfeit tainted assets unless you have them,

17

and so it doesn't apply to untainted assets.

18

The correct reading is that
And

So the government's position in this Court

19

is completely different from the positions it took

20

below.

21

853(a)(1) itself, forfeiture is unavailable except as

22

against the tainted assets.

23

arguments that it seems to have -- that we waived

24

something below is just completely incorrect.

25

abandoned the very theory under which it obtained -- or

It's essentially conceding that under Section

So the government's

Alderson Reporting Company

It's just

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

under which it prevailed in the Sixth Circuit.

2

So then we get to the issues about 853(p)

3

and the money judgments, and I think I heard counsel say

4

in his presentation that Section 853(p) does not provide

5

the exclusive methods for the government to obtain a

6

forfeiture against tainted assets.

7

reference to the argument in their brief regarding the

8

rules of criminal procedure, and that there's forfeiture

9

money judgments discussed in Rule 32.2, and that is just

10

I think that's a

clearly wrong.

11

First, the rule itself -- itself says that

12

the government can only forfeit assets that are

13

available by statute.

14

Second of all, the rules enabling that would

15

just obviously prevent the government from -- in

16

requiring forfeiture that is not authorized by statute

17

through a rule of criminal procedure.

18

pretty clear what this rule of criminal procedure is

19

doing, and we cite an Eighth Circuit case that says what

20

we're going to say right now, which is to say it says

21

that it's a procedural mechanism of implementing the

22

substitute property provision.

23

say:

24

property, whether you spent the money or you hid the

25

money.

I think it's

So the government can

Okay, we're going to forfeit your substitute

Maybe you don't have money right now, but the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

money that is going to come in is going to be property

2

that -- substitute property that's forfeitable.

3

So that is a classic purpose of a rule of

4

criminal procedure.

5

a statutory entitlement to forfeiture under 853(p).

6

does not expend the government's ability to obtain

7

forfeiture through this joint-and-several liability

8

system.

9

It's a procedural rule to implement
It

So when one looks at Section 853(p) and sees

10

the exclusive method of obtaining forfeiture against

11

untainted assets, that's the criteria in Section 853(p),

12

the government doesn't meet them.

13

for the first time in oral argument in this Court that

14

in it couldn't locate through due diligence and maybe

15

this was commingled, it never made his arguments in his

16

briefs, never made his arguments below, and it also

17

never even argued it in its oral presentation that it's

18

Petitioner themselves -- himself that did those things,

19

or that his co-conspirator's actions can be attributed

20

to Petitioner for purposes of Section 853(p).

21

the government really has never tried to establish, and

22

cannot possibly establish on the facts of this case,

23

that it can obtain forfeiture under Section 853(p).

24
25

The government said

And so

And just taking a step back, I think it's
pretty clear what Section 853(p) is doing.

Alderson Reporting Company

What that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

54
1

doing, and the legislative history confirms this and the

2

text itself confirms this, is that it's saying that if

3

you obtain a tainted asset and you thwart the

4

forfeiture, you can't get away with it because the

5

government is going to come after substitute assets.

6

if you -- you collect a million dollars in tainted

7

property and you hide it offshore or you spend it in Las

8

Vegas or something, that doesn't mean you can get away

9

with it.

So

That's why the statute says because of an act

10

of the defendant to render unavailable the property that

11

is described in (a) that's the tainted property, if that

12

happens the government can seek substitute property.

And --

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

But I -- again, I push back

against that because I think that's only true -- the

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So, first of all, I don't

3

think that the government shows that, but at least that

4

would be some theoretical textual argument, remember,

5

that's focused only on (p) rather than (a), which has

6

been the government's theory throughout.

7

I would still disagree that

8

joint-and-several liability is authorized because I just

9

think there's extremely powerful textual, structural,

10

and historical indications that it's just not authorized

11

in the statute.

12

(a)(2) and (a)(3), which the government doesn't respond

13

to.

14

work at all.

15

just don't think Pinkerton has any application in the

16

context of the statute period.

17

For instance, the comparison with

I

The government talks a lot about hornbook

18

law, and hornbook law attributing activities to

19

co-conspirators.

20

recognize that those old hornbooks would never have

21

recognized the principle that the government is

22

advocating here, because the hornbooks would have talked

23

about sentencing and though no content -- no

24

joint-and-several liability under any circumstances, and

25

those hornbooks would have talked about forfeiture which

But I think it's important to

was in rem.

2

Now, it's true that it's in personam rather

3

than in rem now, but there's a -- that -- that's a

4

procedural difference in how the money is collected,

5

which is a -- different from saying that there's a

6

difference in what money is collected.

7

the object of the forfeiture is the same, even the way

8

in which it's collected has changed.

9

government confirms this when it -- it actually concedes

In other words,

And, in fact, the

10

that 853(a)(1) only focuses on the tainted property,

11

exactly like in the in rem forfeiture regime.

12

relevance of that?
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

The relevance is that the --

No, wait.

This was a radical change from what -- what occurred

But this is not in rem.

before.

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Right.

But the fact that

3

it's in personam versus in rem doesn't change the fact

4

that it's the tainted property that's the object of the

5

forfeiture, which is, in fact, the government's

6

concession.

It's part of a criminal judgment.

So I don't think the procedural change

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought the argument was

13

there simply to say there isn't an old tradition of

better than I did.

6

That -- that is indeed our

Thank you for articulating it

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I'm not -- not saying

that.
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I -- I think that -- that

7

the -- there's a broader point here, which is that, in

8

criminal -- in the interpretation of criminal statutes,

9

I think the Court should be careful of how it uses

10

background principles.

11

say that, for instance, the word "conspire" has always

12

meant something and therefore we're going to interpret

13

the word "conspire" the same way.

14

not what the government's doing here.

15

saying that in 1984 -- or actually 1986, when Congress

16

enacted the substitute property provision, the law

17

changed in this very fundamental way to permit

18

joint-and-several liability which had never existed.

19

But, actually, their new joint-and-several liability

20

system is -- is -- is quite different from old

21

applications of Pinkerton.

22

And I think it's one thing to

But that is really
It's -- it's

For instance, it applies only to (a)(1) and

23

not to (a)(2) and (a)(3), and there's different types of

24

forfeitures for everyone in the conspiracy.

the guy who actually obtains it, there's asset freezes

Alderson Reporting Company

For the --

Official - Subject to Final Review

in line with third-party transfers and not for others.

2

So it seems to me that there's very significant

3

modifications in the government's rule than the

4

tradition Pinkerton rule.

5

So the government is saying that silently

6

Congress enacted -- without saying anything in the

7

statute, Congress enacted this very new forfeiture

8

regime, which is similar in some ways and different in

9

other ways from Pinkerton has -- as it had traditionally

10

been applied, and I just don't think the Court reads

11

criminal statutes that way.

12

of common law criminal liability.

13

saying well, here's these concepts from other contexts,

14

let's modify them in various ways that the government

15

thinks makes sense.

16

statutory text because unavailability just makes sense

17

as a criterion, even if Congress never said it, and

18

therefore we have this system of -- of joint-and-several

19

forfeiture liability, and the Court just doesn't do that

20

when it reads criminal statutes.

21

Court to just follow the text literally.

22

That's just a classic form
The government is

We don't really have to look at the

We'd certainly ask the

I -- I'd like to focus on two other

23

arguments made by my colleague.

24

and one about contribution.

25

I actually think that the comparison to restitution is

One about restitution

So in terms of restitution,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

quite a strong argument for us, because that's a

2

situation in which joint-and-several liability makes

3

perfect sense and is also authorized by statute.

4

those are two good reasons that we have

5

joint-and-several liability in that context.

6

And

Joint-and-several liability works in terms

7

of the purposes of the law when it's compensatory.

8

other words, money from one person and money from

9

another person are treated interchangeably because the

In

10

goal is to compensate a victim and the victim doesn't

11

care where the money comes from.

12

in restitution.

13

Congress has enacted a joint-and-several liability

14

system, while also being careful to say that the Court

15

can mitigate the harsh effects of the joint-and-several

16

liability as applied to a particular defendant, by

17

saying well, you don't have to require full

18

joint-and-several liability if it's too harsh.

19

And that is the case

That's why it's hardly surprising that

So that's exactly what one would expect

20

based on the background principles and the text provides

it.

22

word "obtained," but the government seeks to conflict a

23

much hasher form of joint-and-several liability which I

24

think is -- is quite incongruous.

25

And here, Congress did not say that, it used the

And I also think that unlike the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

purposes of -- of forfeiture, but they are totally

3

inconsistent with joint-and-several liability.

4

5

forfeiture, but not -- none -- neither of those two

6

types of purposes have anything to do with

7

joint-and-several liability.

On the issue of contribution, so this notion

17

of State law contribution is an issue that the

18

government doesn't raise in its brief and I'm not aware

19

of any precedent or law that would support that.

20

as I've been aware, until oral argument in this case,

And I -- I certainly

I think that's quite important.

says that actually that doesn't matter because under the

7

common law, you couldn't have contribution in

intentional tort cases anyway.

I think, though, that's
One is that I

10

think the common law is not so clear and, in fact,

11

modern restatements of the common law have an

12

alternative rule.

13

Second of all, the common law rule as

14

applied to vicarious forms of liability, which is sort

15

of what the government is seeking here, actually

16

wouldn't add contribution.

17

that in our brief.

18

We cite some authority for

And, finally, in the Paroline case itself,

19

the government itself rejected that argument in its

20

brief and asked that the Court, and the Court said that

21

the absence of contribution remedy is evidence that

22

Congress didn't intend joint-and-several liability in

23

the first place, and we think that argument applies with

24

full force in this case.

If there's no further questions from the
