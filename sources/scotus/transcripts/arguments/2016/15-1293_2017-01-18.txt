CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case No. 15-1293, Lee v. Tam.
Mr. Stewart.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The statutory provision at issue in this

11

case, 15 U.S.C. 1052(a), prohibits the registration of

12

any mark that may disparage persons, institutions,

13

beliefs, or national symbols.

14

the PTO denied Respondent's application to register The

15

Slants as a service mark for his band.

16

did not limit Respondent's ability to use the mark in

17

commerce, or otherwise to engage in expression or debate

18

on any subject he wishes.

19

Based on that provision,

The PTO's ruling

Because Section 52(a)'s disparagement

20

provision places a reasonable limit on access to a

21

government program rather than a restriction on speech,

22

it does not violate the First Amendment.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

Is copyright -- copyright

a government program?
MR. STEWART:

I think we would say copyright

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and copyright registration is a government program, but

2

it's historically been much more tied to First Amendment

3

values to the incentivization of free expression.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But part of that, seems to

5

me, to ignore the fact that we have a culture in which

6

we have tee shirts and logos and rock bands and so forth

7

that are expressing a -- a point of view.

8

using the -- the market to express views.

9

MR. STEWART:

10

They are

I mean, certainly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I was -- disparagement

11

clearly wouldn't work with copyright, and -- but that's

12

a powerful, important government program.

13
14

MR. STEWART:

Let me say two or three things

about that.

15

First, there's no question that through

16

their music, The Slants are expressing views on social

17

and political issues.

18

to do that.

19

get intellectual property protection that way.

20

They have a First Amendment right

They're able to copyright their songs and

If Congress attempted to prohibit them,

21

either from having copyright protection or copyright

22

registration on their music, that would pose a much more

23

substantial First Amendment issue.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:
issue.

But --

Substantial First Amendment

I was somewhat surprised that in your briefs you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

couldn't bring yourself to say that the government could

2

not deny copyright protection to objectionable material.

3

Are you going to say that?

4

MR. STEWART:

I -- I hate to give away any

5

hypothetical statute without hearing the justification,

6

but I'll come as close as I possibly can to say, yes, we

7

would give that away.

8

deny copyright protection on that ground.

9

It would be unconstitutional to

But I -- I would also say, even in the

10

copyright context, we would distinguish between limits

11

on copyright protection and restrictions on speech.

12

instance, it's historically been the case, and it

13

remains the position of the copyright office, that a

14

person can't copyright new words or short phrases.

15

if a person comes up with something that is original,

16

that is pithy, that makes a point, if it's too short,

17

you can't get copyright protection.

18

For

Even

We would certainly defend the

19

constitutionality of that traditional limit on the scope

20

of copyrightable material, and if there were a First

21

Amendment challenge brought, we would argue that there's

22

a fundamental distinction between saying you can't

23

copyright a four-word phrase and saying you can't say

24

the four-word phrase, or you can't write it in print.

25

But there's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's a significant

2

difference between the copyright regime, you can't sue

3

for copyright infringement unless you register.

4

that so?

5

MR. STEWART:

Isn't

You have to have filed an

6

application to register in order to -- to pursue an

7

infringement suit.

8

believe it's 17 U.S.C. 411(a) indicates that if you

9

filed an application to register your copyright, even if

And so the -- the statute -- I

10

that application has been denied, you can still bring

11

your copyright suit, and the register is entitled to be

12

heard on questions of copyrightability.

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's no restriction

on -- on the trademark.

15

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

You can file

16

a suit under Section 1125(a) of Title 15 under -- under

17

the trademark laws either for infringement or of an

18

unregistered trademark or for unfair competition more

19

generally.

But -- but -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I'm -- I'm

concerned that your government program argument is -- is

circular.

23

mark because it's disparaging, and your answer is, well,

24

we run a program that doesn't include disparaging

25

trademarks, so that's why you're excluded.

The claim is you're not registering on my

Alderson Reporting Company

It -- it

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

doesn't seem to me to advance the argument very much.

2

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the

3

disparagement provision is only one of a number of

4

restrictions on copy -- I'm sorry, on trademark

5

registrability that really couldn't be placed on speech

6

itself.

7

descriptive, that are generic, marks as to which the --

8

the applicant is not the true owner because somebody

9

else was previously using the mark in commerce, those

For example, words -- marks that are merely

10

can't be registered either.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, each of those -- and

12

I know there are several -- are related to the ultimate

13

purpose of a trademark, which is to identify the source

14

of the product.

15

statement.

16

So every trademark makes that

Now, what is -- what purpose or objective of

17

trademark protection does this particular disparagement

18

provision help along or further?

19

the provision that says you can say something nice about

20

a minority group, but you can't say something bad about

21

them.

22

don't know all, but I know many of them, and I can

23

relate that.

24
25

And I'm thinking of

With all the other -- I know the others -- I

You relate this.
MR. STEWART:

I think Congress evidently

concluded that disparaging trademarks would hinder

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

commercial development in the following way:

2

trademark in and of itself is simply a source

3

identifier.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. STEWART:

A

Right.

Its function is to tell the

6

public from whom did the goods or services emanate.

7

is not expressive in its own right.

8
9

It

Now, it is certainly true that many
commercial actors will attempt to devise trademarks that

10

not only can identify them as the source, but that also

11

are intended to convey positive messages about their

12

products.

13

Lube or a B&B that's called Piney Vista.

14

mark is -- is sort of a dual-purpose communication.

15

both identifies the source and it serves as a kind of

16

miniature advertisement.

17

For example, if you see the -- the name Jiffy
The -- the
It

There's always the danger, as some of the

18

amicus briefs on our side point out, that when a person

19

uses as his mark words that have other meanings in

20

common discourse, that it will distract the consumer

21

from the intended purpose of the trademark qua

22

trademark, which is to identify source, and basically

23

Congress says, as long as you are promoting your own

24

product, saying nice things about people, we'll put up

25

with that level of distraction.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But suppose the -- the

2

application here had been for Slants Are Superior.

3

that's a complimentary term.

4

it outside the disparagement bar?

5

MR. STEWART:

So

Would that then be -- take

I -- I think that under the

6

PTO's historical practice, probably not.

7

and I think the same thing would be true of other racial

8

epithets, terms that have long been used as slurs for a

9

particular minority group --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

disparaging of everyone else?

12

well, superior to whom?

13

MR. STEWART:

I believe --

Why isn't that

Slants Are Superior,

I -- I think the basis for the

14

PTO's practice, and they obviously don't have that --

15

this -- that case, is that the term "Slants," in and of

16

itself, when used in relation to Asian-Americans --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have it.

Right.

I want

18

to get the answer to my question because that is the one

19

question I have for you.

20

The only question I have for you is what

21

purpose related to trademarks objective does this serve?

22

And I want to be sure I have your answer.

23

so far was, it prevents the -- or it helps to prevent

24

the user of the product from being distracted from the

25

basic message, which is, I made this product.

Alderson Reporting Company

Your answer

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

I take it that's your answer.

And if that's

2

your answer, I will -- my follow-up question to that

3

would be, I can think probably, and with my law clerks,

4

perhaps 50,000 examples of instances where the space the

5

trademark provides is used for very distracting

6

messages, probably as much or more so than the one at

7

issue, or disparagement.

8

Congress have picking out this one, but letting all the

9

other distractions exist?

10

MR. STEWART:

And what business does

Well, I think what -- I think

11

what you've described as my first-line answer, and I

12

think the precise justification for different kinds

13

of -- for prohibiting registration of different kinds of

14

disparaging trademarks would depend to some extent on

15

who is being disparaged.

16

That is, in the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not disparaging; your

17

answer was distracting.

18

great things of 99 percent of all trademarks is they

19

don't just identify; boy, do they distract.

20

of advertising.

21

you didn't provide an answer to disparagement.

22

answer is why disparagement was they don't want

23

distraction from the message.

24
25

And -- and -- and one of the

It's a form

So if the answer is distracting, not --

MR. STEWART:

You're

They don't want -- they don't

want distraction and they don't want particular type --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

types of distraction.

2

That is, when we're dealing --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's where I have the

3

question.

4

of distraction, disparagement, and any purpose of a

5

trademark?

What relation is there to a particular type

6

MR. STEWART:

The -- the type -- the type of

7

distraction that may be caused by a disparaging

8

trademark will depend significantly on the precise type

9

of disparagement at issue.

That is, in the case of

10

racial epithets, these words are known to cause harm, to

11

cause controversy.

12

they may be no more distracting than a positive message,

13

but Congress can determine this is the wrong kind of

14

distraction.

They -- in some sense they may no --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Stewart, please.
Another type would be a

17

competing soft drink manufacturer who wants to register

18

the trademark Coke Stinks, who wants to identify his own

19

product with a sentiment that is antithetical to one of

20

his competitors.

21

not to encourage that form of commerce.

22

to -- that -- that commercial actors will promote their

23

own products rather than disparage others.

24

under the First Amendment, we couldn't prevent that kind

25

of criticism, but we can decline to encourage it.

Congress can determine we would prefer

Alderson Reporting Company

We can prefer

Obviously,

I'm sorry.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Assume government speech

3

itself is not involved.

4

government programs were subject to one extremely

5

important constraint, which is that they can't make

6

distinctions based on viewpoint.

I always thought that

7

So why isn't this doing exactly that?

8

MR. STEWART:

9

Because it -- it precludes

disparagement of all and it casts a wide net.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

It --

Well, that's

11

absolutely true.

12

Democrats and Republicans alike, and so forth and so on,

13

but it makes a very important distinction, which is that

14

you can say good things about some person or group, but

15

you can't say bad things about some person or group.

16

It -- it precludes disparagement of

So, for example, let's say that I wanted a

17

mark that expressed the idea that all politicians are

18

corrupt, or just that Democrats are corrupt.

19

way, it doesn't matter.

20

though I could get a mark saying that all politicians

21

are virtuous, or that all Democrats are virtuous.

22

Either way, it doesn't matter.

23

Either

I couldn't get that mark, even

You see the point.

The point is that I can say good things

24

about something, but I can't say bad things about

25

something.

And I would have thought that that was a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination.

2

MR. STEWART:

Well, as we pointed out in our

3

brief, laws like libel laws have -- have not

4

historically been treated as discriminating based on

5

viewpoint, even though they --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's libelism, one

7

of our historically different, but very distinct

8

categories.

9

falls into a category of low value speech in the way

And you don't make the claim that this

10

that libel laws and the way that defamation does or

11

fighting words or something like that.

12

looking to create a new category.

13

And you're not

So in that case, it seems that the

14

viewpoint-based ban applies, and -- and this -- as I

15

said, I would be interested to hear your answer of why

16

the example that I stated is not viewpoint-based.

17

says you can say something bad about -- you can say

18

something good about somebody, but not something bad

19

about somebody or something.

20

MR. STEWART:

It

Well, certainly if you singled

21

out a particular category of people like political

22

officials and say -- said you can't say anything bad

23

about any of them, but you can say all the good things

24

you want, I think that would be viewpoint-based, because

25

it would be protected a discrete group of people.

2

Let me just give a -- a couple of other
answers.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why isn't that this?
But -- but if you didn't

5

limit it, if you -- if you said you can't say anything

6

bad about anybody any time, that's okay?

7

MR. STEWART:

Again, it's -- again, we're

8

not saying you can't say anything bad.

9

don't register your trademark if it is disparaging.

10
11

We're saying we

Certainly -JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, no, no.

That's -- it --

12

as I said, even in a government program, even assuming

13

that this is not just a classic speech restriction,

14

you're still subject to the constraint that you can't

15

discriminate on -- on the basis of viewpoint.

16

MR. STEWART:

Well, in -- in Boos v. Barry,

17

it's -- it's not a majority opinion, but the Court there

18

was confronted with a law that made it illegal to -- I

19

believe it was post signs or engage in expressive

20

activity within 500 feet of a foreign embassy that was

21

intended to bring the foreign government into contempt

22

or disrepute.

23

sweeping too broadly, but at least the -- the plurality

24

would have held that it was not viewpoint-based because

25

it applied to all foreign embassies.

And the -- the law was struck down as

Alderson Reporting Company

It didn't turn on

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1
2

the nature of the criticism.
Another example I would give, and it's a

3

hypothetical example, but at least I have a strong

4

instinct as to how the -- the case should be decided.

5

Suppose at a public university the -- the school set

6

aside a particular room where students could post

7

messages on topics that were of interest or concern to

8

them as a way of promoting debate in a

9

nonconfrontational way, and the school said, just two

10

ground rules:

11

attacks on any other members of the school community.

12

No racial epithets and no personal

It -- it would seem extraordinary to say

13

that's a viewpoint-based distinction that can't stand

14

because you're allowed to say complimentary things about

15

your fellow students --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so the government is

17

the omnipresent schoolteacher?

18

you're saying?

19

MR. STEWART:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21
22

I mean, is that what

No.
The government's a

schoolteacher?
MR. STEWART:

No.

Again, that analysis

23

would apply only if the public school was setting aside

24

a room in its own facility.

25

attempted more broadly to restrict disparaging speech by

Clearly, if the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

students or others rather than simply to limit the terms

2

under which a forum for communication could be made

3

available, that would involve entirely different

4

questions.

5

would have found the law unconstitutional even though

6

they found it not to be viewpoint-based.

7

That's why the plurality in Boos v. Barry

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But one distinction

8

is the scope of the government program.

9

talking about a particular discussion venue at a -- at a

If you're

10

public university, that's one thing.

11

about the entire trademark program, it seems to me to be

12

something else.

13

MR. STEWART:

If you're talking

Well, the -- the trademark

14

registration program and trademarks generally have not

15

historically served as vehicles for expression.

16

is, the Lanham Act defines trademark and service mark

17

purely by reference to their source identification

18

function.

19

That

And I think it's -- to -- to get back to

20

copyright for just a second, I think it's at least

21

noteworthy that everyone would recognize that Mr. Tam is

22

not entitled to a copyright on The Slants.

23

copyright office doesn't register short phrases.

24

words is certainly short, especially when one of them --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Slants because the PTO thinks that's a bad word.

5

it not count at all that everyone knows that The Slants

6

7

to describe?

This is -- this is -- you can't say

8

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think -It takes the sting out of

the word.

11

MR. STEWART:

Well, the trademark examining

12

attorney went through this in a lot of detail.

13

trademark examiner acknowledged that Mr. Tam's sincere

14

intent appeared to be to reclaim the word, to use it as

15

a symbol of Asian-American pride rather than to use it

16

as a slur.

17

form of Internet commentary to the effect that many

18

Asian-Americans, even those who recognized that this was

19

Mr. Tam's intent, still found the use of the word as a

20

band name offensive.

21

And the

He -- he also found a lot of evidence in

But the point I was trying to make about

22

copyright is, is not that copyright protection would be

23

denied on the ground of disparagement.

24

would be denied because it's a short phrase and not even

25

an original phrase.

You're right, it

But copyright is kind of the branch

Alderson Reporting Company

of intellectual property law that is specifically

2

intended to foster free expression on matters of

3

cultural and political, among other, significance.

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you deny that trademarks

are used for expressive purposes?

6

MR. STEWART:

I don't deny that trademarks

7

are used for expressive purposes.

8

earlier, I think many commercial actors will pick a mark

9

that will not only serve as a source identifier, but

10

that will cast their products in an attractive light

11

and/or that will communicate a message on some other

12

topic.

13

particular trademarks should be registered, Congress is

14

entitled to focus exclusively on the source

15

identification aspect.

As I was saying

17

stretching this, the -- the concept of a government

18

program, past the breaking point.

19

provides lots of services to the general public.

20

don't think you would say that those fall within the

about, like providing police protection to the general

I think those would raise

serious -- I mean, depending on the nature of the -- the

5

distinction -- equal protection problems, potential --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There are potential -- there

7

are potential First Amendment problems, too, if the

8

nature of the distinction was based on the person's

9

speech; isn't that right?

MR. STEWART:

Certainly.

So absolutely clearly if it

was based on viewpoint.

14

want to interrupt your answer to Justice Alito, if --

15

but I want to get back to -- because I don't really

16

understand the answer that you gave me before.

17

a government regulation that distinguished between

18

saying politicians are good and virtuous and politicians

19

are corrupt would clearly be viewpoint-based; is that

20

right?

And -- and so I guess I don't

21

MR. STEWART:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You said

Right.
So -- and similarly, if you

23

said that the flag is a wonderful emblem, this -- this

24

applies to national symbols --

25

MR. STEWART:

Uh-huh.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- but you could say that

2

the flag is a wonderful emblem, but you can't say that

3

the flag is a terrible emblem.

4

MR. STEWART:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

That would be

viewpoint-based.

7

MR. STEWART:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

I --

Well -I mean, that's what this --

this regulation does.

10

MR. STEWART:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you're talk -It says you can say one of

12

those things, but you can't say the other and get

14

MR. STEWART:

But it -- it sweeps with a

15

broad brush -- brush.

16

viewpoint-based discrimination has historically been the

17

most disfavored type of regulation from a First

18

Amendment perspective is that it creates the danger that

19

the government is attempting to suppress disfavored

20

messages.

21

Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decision from 1969 that

22

declined to register a proposed trademark that was

23

essentially the Soviet hammer and sickle with a slash

25

that it disparaged the national symbol of the Soviet

5

disfavored viewpoint.

6

of my defense of the statute is it casts -- it sweeps

7

with such a broad brush --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Now, obviously, hostility towards the Soviet

No one would have perceived the denial of

And the point of the -- the point

But that's like saying it

does so much viewpoint-based discrimination that it
becomes all right.

11

MR. STEWART:

But it -- it does so -- I

12

mean, it -- it imposes this restriction only within the

13

confines of a government program.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And --

Yes, yes.

And -- and I'm

15

willing to give you that.

16

again, assuming it's not government speech itself, even

17

government programs are subject to this constraint,

18

which is that you can't distinguish based on the

19

viewpoint of a speaker.

20

MR. STEWART:

But even government programs,

Well, part -- part of this

21

government program is government speech.

22

me just describe the two types of basic services that

23

the PTO performs in the course of administering the --

24

the program.

25

And let -- let

First, when an application is filed, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

examining attorney and potentially the -- the Trademark

2

Trial and Appeal Board will go through it to see whether

3

the applicant satisfies the statutory prerequisites to

4

registration.

5

essential to having a valid trademark.

6

prerequisites to registration overlap with the

7

prerequisites to having a valid trademark.

8

the examining attorney decides, is this merely

9

descriptive, is it generic, does it serve as a mark that

And some of those, like 1052(a), are not
But many of the

And so when

10

consumers will associate with the -- the product in

11

commerce, is this person the true owner of the mark, the

12

examining attorney is deciding the same sorts of

13

questions that could arise in an infringement suit if

14

the applicant ever filed one.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

That's another one.

17

just like disparaged.

18

the mark; right?

19

And therefore -What about scandalous?

Scandalous or immoral.

Those are

They block you from registering

MR. STEWART:

They do block you from

20

registering the mark, not -- not from filing an

21

infringement suit or alleging unfair competition.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because that's the same

thing.
MR. STEWART:

That's -- that's the -- that's

the same thing as disparagement.

I -- I was just saying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

many of the other statutory prerequisites do overlap

2

with the prerequisites to having a valid trademark.

3

And so if the examining attorney approves

4

the application, he is giving the -- the applicant at

5

least some comfort that he can continue to use the mark

6

in commerce with a degree of confidence that if somebody

7

else infringes the mark, he will be able to satisfy

8

the -- the prerequisites.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Running the Federal

10

courts is a government program.

11

courts -- when it comes to trademarks, the courts are

12

not open for actions to enforce infringement of a

13

disparaging trademark?

14

MR. STEWART:

Can you say that the

If Congress had taken to its

15

furthest possible step the desire to disassociate the

16

Federal government from the enforcement of -- or from

17

these marks --

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that was how the

hypothetical was framed --

20

MR. STEWART:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
-- the furthest

22

possible step.

23

same analysis you do simply with the -- as in this case?

24

How far can they go in defining the government program?

25

But it's the same -- do you apply the

MR. STEWART:

I think we would typically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

think of the -- the PTO as exercise of discretionary

2

authority and as -- the exercise of discretionary

3

authority by an executive branch agency as -- as

4

different from the neutral enforcement of the law by --

5

by the courts.

6

Obviously --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If it's a government

7

program, can you do anything you want with speech?

8

Or what -- what are -- what are the restrictions that we

9

can -- is it intermediate?

10

You don't argue that this

statute meets strict scrutiny.

11

MR. STEWART:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

MR. STEWART:

I think -- I think -I take it you don't.

No.

I think the basic test

14

would be is it reasonably relate -- related to the

15

objectives of the government program, and in cases of

16

viewpoint discrimination, in cases where the -- the

17

program raises the concern that the government is

18

attempting to promote disfavored messages and suppress

19

disfavored messages, the -- the program would be

20

presumptively unconstitutional.

21

The second form of service that the PTO

22

provides in the course of administering the program is

23

that if it decides the trademark should be registered,

24

it publishes the trademark on the Federal Register.

25

publication has a -- is significant in a variety of

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

ways.

2

publication of the trademark on the Federal Register

3

reduces the likelihood that any infringement will occur,

4

because it provides notice to potential competitors in

5

commerce that the PTO has approved this mark.

6

give them an incentive to choose marks that are not

7

confusingly similar.

8
9

First, outside the -- the context of legal suits,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It will

And just as importantly,

because your time is running, the questions have

10

concentrated on viewpoint discrimination, but there's

11

also a large concern with vagueness here, and the list

12

that we have of things that were trademarked and things

13

that weren't.

14

"Heb," and that was okay in one application and it was

15

not okay in another.

16

Take, for example, one had the word

MR. STEWART:

First, if -- if the Court

17

accepts our basic theory that this should be judged by

18

the standards that typically apply to government

19

benefits under a government program, although the

20

statute doesn't draw an entirely bright line, it's

21

sufficiently clear.

22

instance, the criteria for awarding any A grants that

23

were at issue in Finley to the effect that the -- the

24

grant givers should take account of the diverse views

25

and -- and beliefs of the American public.

The Court has approved, for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The trademark -- the PTO receives 300,000

2

trademark applications every year, so it's not

3

surprising that there is some potential inconsistency.

4
5

And the other thing I would -- the other two
things I would say are, first --

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

say it's not clear enough for them to get it right?

8
9
10
11

Isn't it another way to

MR. STEWART:
rule.

It -- it's not a bright-line

I would say two things -- two further things

before I sit down.
The first is that I think a lot of the

12

examples that the PTO has had trouble with and where it

13

may -- there may be an appearance in, perhaps, the fact

14

of inconsistent decisions, are instances where people

15

are deliberately using terms that have historically been

16

insulting, but with the intent to be edgy, provocative,

17

to reclaim the slur.

18

when people self-consciously use words in a way other

19

than they have traditionally been used, it's not

20

surprising that -- that sometimes they're -- they're

21

misunderstood.

22

This is entirely legitimate, but

The second thing I'd say is the examples

23

that the other side gives are -- raise the concern that

24

the PTO might have approved some trademarks that it

25

shouldn't have approved, but they really haven't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

identified any examples of marks that were rejected as

2

disparaging, even though no reasonable person could view

3

them as such.

5

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of
my time.

MR. CONNELL:

Thank you, Counsel.

Suppose we had this

MR. CONNELL:

that position.

6

That is correct.

-- because marks constitute

both commercial speech and noncommercial speech, and the

10

disparagement clause specifically targets the

11

noncommercial speech and denies registration to marks

12

that only express negative views.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I have -But in your view, the

15

Congress could not draw a statute, even different to

no statute denying trademark protection in the

20

MR. CONNELL:

I cannot think of a

21

circumstance under which that could occur.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then I have a question

23

for you.

24

one is stopping your client from calling itself The

25

Slants.

This is a bit different than most cases.

No one is stopping them from advertising

Alderson Reporting Company

No

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

themselves that way, or signing contracts that way, or

2

engaging in any activity, except that stopping someone

3

else from using the same trademark.

4

could do.

5

to sue under the Lanham Act's entitlement for the

6

confusion of the public in the use of any kind of

7

registered or unregistered mark.

8

themselves Slants, they would be subject to deceptive

9

advertisements because they wouldn't be this Slants.

10

But even that they

Because you don't need a registered trademark

If another band called

So there is a big difference.

You are

11

asking the government to endorse your name to the extent

12

of protecting it in a way that it chooses not to.

13

it -- there is a reason why the argument's appealing.

14

And why shouldn't we consider it in those ways when your

15

speech is not being burdened in any traditional way?

16

MR. CONNELL:

So

The registration program, the

17

regulatory system of trademark registration, is widely

18

available to a broad number of mark holders who seek the

19

legal protections of registration.

20

In this case, the government has used the

21

disparagement clause to selectively deny those legal

22

benefits to a mark holder expressing negative views that

23

the government favors, as opposed to mark holders who

24

received those benefits because they express neutral or

25

positive views that the government does favor.

6

burden because our client is denied the benefits of

legal protections that are necessary for him to compete

resort at that point would be to seek the protection

15

figure -- Trump is a thief and that becomes their

16

trademark, that even if they go to court and prove that

17

that's a libel or a slander, that trademark would still

18

exist and would be capable of use because otherwise

19

canceling it would be an abridgement of the First

20

Amendment?

21

MR. CONNELL:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I believe that's correct.
That makes no sense.

Mr. Connell, don't you think

24

that Congress could deny a trademark registration for

25

something that fit within the narrow, historically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

recognized category of libel and slander which have

2

never been regarded as having First Amendment

3

protection?

4

MR. CONNELL:

I -- I think the outer limit

5

of the protection here are the categories of

6

historically prescribed speech.

7

threats, it would include fraud, things such as that.

8

That's not the case, obviously, with the mark that we're

9

using here.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That would include

Well, one of the things,

11

Mr. Connell, that troubles me about this case is that

12

it's not quite as simple as just saying, well, here's a

13

government program and the government is discriminating

14

on the basis of viewpoint, because there are aspects of

15

this program that seem like government speech itself,

16

maybe not quite that, but something approaching it,

17

which is the program says that anything that's

18

registered, the government publishes in its own

19

publication.

20

again, in its own publication.

21

geared in such a way that individual marks that are

22

registered end up being -- I doubt anybody would ascribe

23

them to the government, but the government republishes

24

them, communicates them and so forth.

25

aspect of the program give the government greater leeway

The government sends to foreign countries,
So the whole program is

Alderson Reporting Company

And doesn't that

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

here than it would in a typical program in which no

2

government speech itself is involved?

3

MR. CONNELL:

It does not.

The register

4

simply serves as a recordation of the marks that the

5

government has approved according to the statutory

6

criteria.

7

registration, patent registration, marriage license

8

registration, car registrations, any other kind of

9

typical government registrations that are simply

This is in no way different than copy

10

ministerial.

The government is not speaking.

11

its message.

The control over the creation and design

12

of the mark is retained at all times by the owner.

13

There is no history here of the government using marks

14

to speak through private mark holders, and there's no

15

association with -- between the government and -- and

16

the mark itself.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not

But doesn't the

18

government have some interest in disassociating itself

19

from racial ethnic slur -- slurs?

20

about the license -- Texas license, vanity license

21

plate, and they said we won't do one with the

22

Confederate flag.

23

MR. CONNELL:

Things like, what

That was specifically a

24

government speech case.

25

is not a government ID, issued on government property,

That's not our case here.

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

controlled by the government as to design and content

2

and so on.

3

It's -- in fact, it's exactly the opposite.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You've said --

4

you've said several times that the problem is that the

5

government is burdening noncommercial -- the

6

noncommercial aspects of the trademark, but it seems to

7

me that that's an awfully blurry line.

8

trademarks promote the commercial aspect, in fact, by

9

disparaging other groups.

A lot of these

So they figure that it's a

10

way to promote sales.

11

between the commercial aspect of the trademark and the

12

noncommercial aspect?

13

How do you tell the difference

MR. CONNELL:

The commercial aspect is that

14

part of the mark that simply identifies the source of

15

the good or service in question.

16

Slants, there's another component, that being the

17

noncommercial, which communicates the political and

18

social message of Asian pride.

19

In the case of The

This is akin to Justice Breyer before

20

talking about the in -- inherit advertisement that can

21

take place.

22

people associate the music with the band name and the

23

band name with the music that they perform.

24
25

Bands don't exist without names, and -- and

So that -- that is where the noncommercial
aspect of -- of the speech comes in.

Alderson Reporting Company

And to the extent

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

that the government is burdening it by denying

2

registration because they believe that it -- it conveys

3

a negative view, that's unconstitutional.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You want us to say that

5

trademark law is just like a public park -- the public

6

park, a public forum, the classic example of where you

7

can say anything you want.

8

trademarks just like we treat speech in a public park.

9

Thank you very much.

10
11

We treat this -- we treat

Good-bye.

That's it.

That's your

argument.
MR. CONNELL:

It -- it is my argument.

I

12

think the limitation on that, as I said before, are the

13

categories of historically prescribable speech.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Connell, this

15

can't be right, because think of all the other things,

16

the other -- I mean, I'll call them content distinctions

17

because they are -- that trademark law just makes.

18

mean, Section 2 prohibits the registration of any mark

19

that's falsely suggestive of a connection with persons

20

likely to cause confusion, descriptive, misdescriptive,

21

functional, a geographic indication for wine or spirits,

22

government insignia, a living person's name, portrait,

23

or signature.

24

distinctions in a -- in a -- in a public park, and yet,

25

of course, you can make them in trademark law, can't

I

You couldn't make any of those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1
2

you?
MR. CONNELL:

All of those other

3

distinctions are viewpoint-neutral and advance the

4

commercial objectives of the Lanham Act in terms of

5

reducing consumer confusion.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, these might be

7

viewpoint-neutral, but they're certainly not

8

content-neutral, and yet we would -- I mean, I think

9

that a challenge to many of these would fall flat.

10

MR. CONNELL:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

On what basis?
Because -- like, how is

12

trademark law supposed to function unless it can make

13

these kinds of distinctions?

14
15

MR. CONNELL:

I'm suggesting that those --

those sections would survive.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. CONNELL:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -Section B --- okay.

If those would

19

survive, then this is not a public park, because those

20

would not survive in a public park.

21

MR. CONNELL:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Agreed.
There's something different

23

here, in other words, that this is coming up in the

24

context of a government program --

25

MR. CONNELL:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- which provides certain

2

benefits that the government doesn't have to provide at

3

all.

4

MR. CONNELL:

The -- the point here is

5

that the -- the government program, at least the goals

6

of the Lanham Act, are to reduce consumer confusion, and

7

that is a legitimate interest that the government has.

8

And these -- these factors under 1052 advance that --

9

that purpose.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

I want to come back to

11

the -- the Chief Justice's question.

12

difficulty separating the expressive from the commercial

13

aspect of a trademark.

14

Let me give you an example.

I think that Nike's phrase "Just Do It" is a

15

registered trademark.

16

that expressive?

17

I really have

Now, is that commercial or is

MR. CONNELL:

It is both.

The -- the two

18

are intertwined.

19

have the source identifier that is inextricably

20

intertwined with the message that the mark is -- is

21

conveying about the source -- or about the goods and

22

services identified.

23

The -- just like with The Slants.

JUSTICE ALITO:

You

Well, if they're

24

inexplicably intertwined, then I -- I don't understand

25

how we can separate them and apply to the expressive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

part a more rigorous test than we would apply to the

2

commercial part.

3
4

MR. CONNELL:

I'm not sure I understand your

question.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Do you think

6

that viewpoint discrimination is always prohibited in

7

commercial speech?

8

say -- and maybe it already has said -- that a

9

manufacturer of cigarettes could not place on a package

For example, could the government

10

of cigarettes "Great for your health.

11

surgeon general"?

12

MR. CONNELL:

Don't believe the

Viewpoint discrimination is

13

prohibited in commercial speech, no question, under the

14

Sorrell case.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's back to really

16

the Chief Justice's question.

17

but I think -- except that I think you do have something

18

of an answer that you haven't fully expressed.

19

Look.

I -- I wouldn't ask it,

We're creating, through government, a

20

form of a property right, a certain form.

21

trademark.

22

certain kind of physical property right that certain

23

people could dedicate a small part of their houses or

24

land to Peaceful Grove.

25

write messages, but peaceful messages.

That's a

It's as if through government we created a

And in Peaceful Grove, you

Alderson Reporting Company

And above all,

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

you don't write messages that will provoke others to

2

violence or bad feelings.

3

Okay?

Anything wrong with that?

I can't think of

4

anything wrong with that.

5

where they can express hostile feelings.

6

this tiny place, one-quarter of an acre, that you

7

yourself have chosen to take advantage of that you can't

8

because it will destroy the purpose.

9

the purpose of Peaceful Grove.

10

There are thousands of places
It's just in

It will destroy

That's why I asked my

question.

11

To what extent does interfering with

12

viewpoints here serve a trademark-related purpose?

13

we can see how in Peaceful Grove or in Shakespeare, the

14

messages that we were talking about did harm the

15

government purpose.

16

disparaging messages get in the way of the objective of

17

this program, which is to identify the source.

18

that, I think, is what I heard.

19

you to think about and respond to.

20

As

And here, they're saying similarly,

MR. CONNELL:

Now,

That's what I'd like

Disparaging messages in

21

22

control the -- the other component of -- of the message.

23

3

What the government objects to is the
It's the other message.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I understand that.

4

But now your answer -- okay, I've got your answer.

5

now your other answers were worrying me, because what's

6

worrying me is I accept what you just said -- suppose I

7

did; am I suddenly saying no Peaceful Grove, no

8

Shakespeare celebration, no normal restrictions on

9

normal restrictions, no function -- you know, it's

And

10

functional, can't have functional things in a trademark,

11

da, da, da, all the ones we read.

12

answer just -- that you just gave, have I suddenly

13

opened the door to striking down all those things?

14
15

MR. CONNELL:

No.

If I buy into your

I don't think so,

because --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. CONNELL:

Well, why not?

Because the purpose, as -- as

18

you said, Your Honor, of Peaceful Grove was to have a

19

place of seclusion, of solitude, of -- of calm.

20

completely different than the trademark regime, which is

21

open to all comers and which simply is trying to advance

22

the goal of source identification.

23

holder wishes to include a component in the mark to

24

somehow advertise the good, the service to convey a

25

different message, that doesn't get in the way of the

That's

And if the mark

Well, but it seems

3

to me that you're defining the government program

differently than the government would.

suggesting that there's more to their program than just

source identification.

MR. CONNELL:

I think they're

Well, we heard --

-- a politeness statute.
Well, we heard from

Mr. Stewart that they thought the disparagement aspect

would distract from the commercial identification.

I think that's what he said.

that's -- that's not really their purpose or --

I --

Yes.

Well, I'll say they -- that's

I mean, that seems to be pulled

out of thin air by the government, who, again, in their

brief talks about reducing the -- the level of insult or

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. STEWART:

19

Let make three quick points.

20

Mr. Connell has said that the government --

21

that the government registration program regulates only

22

the expressive and not the commercial aspect of the

23

mark, and I think that's getting it exactly backwards.

24

The -- Mr. Tam wants to do two things with the mark The

25

Slants.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

He wants to use the mark himself in relation to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

his band, and he wants to be able to sue other people

2

who use it in a way that would cause him commercial

3

harm.

4

second thing.

5

to use the mark.

available for infringement, but -- but that's entirely

7

regulating the commercial aspects of the conduct.

8
9

And denial of a registration affects only the
It places no restrictions on his ability
It may limit the remedies that are

The second thing is Mr. Connell's position
clearly is that the test for constitutionality of a

10

registration condition is, could the government ban this

11

speech altogether?

12

eviscerate the trademark registration program.

13

obviously, as -- as Justice Kagan has pointed out, there

14

are a lot of other content-based registration criteria.

15

And putting that in place would
Most

And in addition, I'd point out one of the

16

prerequisites to registration is that you be using the

17

mark in commerce.

18

speech, we'd ask by what authority could the government

19

make the right to speech contingent on providing goods

20

and services in commerce.

If this were truly a suppression of

24

of the principal register is not just an ancillary

25

consequence of this program.

And there is an important government
The preparation

It's the whole point to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

provide a list of trademarks so other people know what

2

has been approved, what's off limits.

3

And the consequence of Mr. Connell's

4

position is that the government would have to place on a

5

principal register, communicate to foreign countries the

6

vilest racial epithets, insulting caricatures of

7

venerated religious figures.

8

government has to do that can't be coextensive with the

9

test for whether private people can engage in that form

The test for whether the

of expression.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Stewart, you really

12

think that speech can be restricted by the government on

13

the ground that foreign countries may object to it?

14

Could -- could the government do that with

15

copyright?

16

copyrighted in this country that are deeply offensive to

17

some foreign countries, and yet, the FBI enforces the

18

copyright laws.

19

I mean, an awful lot of things are

MR. STEWART:

I would agree that with the

20

copyright is different.

21

more fundamental role in free expression than trademark

22

law has played, but the government, at the very least,

23

has a significant interest in not incorporating into its

24

own communications words and symbols that the public and

25

foreign countries will find offensive.
