ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The parties here agree that a Federal

12

employee has a mixed case when he alleges that he was

13

affected by an appealable civil service action and

14

discrimination.

15

ceases to be a mixed case if and when the Board decides

16

that the employee hasn't proven that he was affected by

17

an appealable civil service action.

18

question is no.

19

The parties dispute whether the case

The answer to that

Whenever the Board rejects an employee's

20

allegations that he was affected by an appealable civil

21

service action, the Board is making a substantive

22

decision on the merits of the employee's civil service

23

claim.

24

jurisdiction and, therefore, nothing to do with whether

25

the employee has brought a mixed case reviewable in

That point has nothing to do with the Board's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

district court as opposed to the Federal Circuit.

2

Here, as in so many cases, the root of the problem is

3

the word "jurisdiction."

4

employee's allegations that he was affected by an

5

appealable civil service action, the Board labels its

6

decision "jurisdictional."

7

The Board's conclusion that the employee's civil service

8

claim fails on the merits doesn't retroactively strip

9

the Board of jurisdiction, just as the failure of an

Whenever the Board rejects an

That label is incorrect.

10

alleged Federal question on the merits doesn't

11

retroactively strip a Federal court of jurisdiction.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry -Just -- just as an

14

introductory question, Mr. Landau -- it's really

15

probably more for the government than for you -- but if

16

the government were to review, this same case could

17

potentially go from the Board to the Federal Circuit,

18

back to the Board, then to the district court.

19

Is there any other scheme like that?

Is

20

there anything that the government might point to that

21

is an analogous scheme?

22

MR. LANDAU:

I don't think they will be able

23

to, Your Honor.

24

Federal Circuit for a decision, where ultimately the

25

Federal Circuit can't resolve the case is unprecedented,

And certainly that detour to the

in my experience.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Certainly -But the district court

4

couldn't resolve the case at this point either because

5

the internal revenues weren't exhausted.

6

appealability -- the civil service appealability goes to

7

the district court, then it has to go back to MSPB, and

8

it gets to the district court only if -- if the EEO

9

remedy has been exhausted; isn't that so?

10

MR. LANDAU:

So if the

Well, you raise an interesting

11

question, Your Honor, about exhaustion.

12

defense.

13

court and the court rejects the -- the Board -- excuse

14

me -- the court affirms the Board on the civil service

15

claim -- again, that's really a merits determination

16

that the Board has made, notwithstanding its label --

17

then there would certainly be a question, Your Honor, as

18

to whether or not the discrimination case has been

19

exhausted.

20

Exhaustion is a

If the government -- if you're in the district

For a period -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government -- the

21

government takes the position that it hasn't been in

22

23

district court on a discrimination claim without

24

exhausting your internal remedy.

25

MR. LANDAU:

You can't get to the

It could take that position,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

Your Honor.

2

could be a fight about exhaustion at that point, whether

3

or not having presented the case to the MSPB in the

4

first instance was exhaustion.

5

even under -- under the government's own scenario,

6

district courts deal with unexhausted claims every day

7

and have mechanisms for dealing with that.

8

And, arguably, they did -- there certainly

But, if not, Your Honor,

The district court could hold the case in

9

abeyance, for instance, and send the case -- and -- and

10

require the employee to exhaust in the agency, but that

11

doesn't mean that the case doesn't belong in the

12

district court in the first place.

13

kind of a remedial point.

14

district court, our whole point here is that this is a

15

mixed case, so you should be in district court in the

16

first place as opposed to the Federal Circuit.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's really a --

Once you wind up in the

Can I -- you could

18

go to the district court right away simply by skipping

19

the MSPB; right?

20

MR. LANDAU:

Absolutely.

And that's one of

21

the problems with their argument, Your Honor, because

22

under -- under that point, one of their main arguments

23

is that the scheme is set up to create a uniform system

24

of -- uniform jurisprudence of civil service

25

appealability decisions.

But that argument doesn't work

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

on its face precisely because, as Your Honor just

2

stated, you don't have to go the MSPB route to do this.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think -- I

4

think you're right that it -- it's a problem.

I

5

just can't figure out who it's a problem for.

The --

6

the -- I mean, if you're concerned about the

7

consequences of what the MSPB might do, you can skip it

8

altogether and go -- go to district court right away;

9

right?

10

MR. LANDAU:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but you certainly don't -You -- you would have to

12

exhaust before you go to the district court.

13

couldn't just go from the decision.

14

MR. LANDAU:

15

think that's correct.

16

You

Correct, Your Honor.

No, I

But there's two --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that -- that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

do that, you have to exhaust; right?

3

MR. LANDAU:

No.

Now, before you can

The -- the -- filing your

4

complaint in the agency EEO is the exhaustion mechanism

5

in the agency.

6

to go to the MSPB.

7

The alternative exhaustion mechanism is
So you have the two paths there.

The point that I was making earlier, Your

8

Honor, just to be clear, is that you can have a

9

situation where you go straight from exhausting in the

10

agency EEO your mixed case.

11

be exhausted in the agency EEO.

So the mixed case also can

12

That -- and in that determination -- this is

13

7702(a)(2) -- the EEO -- the agency EEO also has to make

14

a determination under (a)(2)(1) about the Board's

15

jurisdiction.

16

determination made by the agency EEO, but we know that

17

the agency EEO decisions always go straight to district

18

court.

19

can't possibly be that there's this desire for a

20

uniformity of a -- a law of appealability in the Federal

21

Circuit if one of the two avenues -- the -- the agency

22

EEO avenue never sends you near the Federal Circuit.

23

So there has to be an appealability

They never go to the Federal Circuit.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it

If you had chosen to go

24

directly to the district court, if you had bypassed the

25

Merit System Protection Board, would you be able to

raise in the district court the question whether the

2

alleged removal was proper under 7 -- 7513, whether it

3

was -- would promote the efficiency of the service, or

4

would you have at that point only the discrimination

5

claim?

6

MR. LANDAU:

Well, Your Honor, just to be

7

clear, you -- in any of these mixed cases, you have to

8

exhaust somewhere, either in the MSPB or in the agency

9

EEO.

So in -- in either scenario, you -- we can see

10

that you have to exist -- excuse me -- you have to

assertion in the government's brief, because that's

And so I -- I don't know where that idea
came up, but we --

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

MR. LANDAU:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. --

-- firmly disagree with that.
Mr. Landau, that -- that

8

raises a question I have for you.

9

that both sides agree on the premise that mixed cases

Seem -- seems to me

10

can go to the district court, so the district court can

11

adjudicate some civil service disputes.

12

MR. LANDAU:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Correct.
Where in the statute is

14

that provided?

15

cases of discrimination filed under Federal

16

discrimination laws go to district court.

I look at 7703(b)(2), and it speaks of

17

MR. LANDAU:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's a -- right.
And then I look at the

19

standards of review.

20

Federal Circuit talks about normal agency, APA-type

21

review, in (c) --

And the standard of review for the

22

MR. LANDAU:

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

24
25

Right.
-- which makes sense for

civil service claims.
MR. LANDAU:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1
2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The only standard of

review mentioned for district courts is de novo --

3

MR. LANDAU:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.
-- which makes sense for

5

discrimination claims, but not for civil service claims

6

that might tag along in district court.

7

MR. LANDAU:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9
10

Right.
So but -- by what -- what

authority does a district court ever have the power to
hear a civil service claim?

11

MR. LANDAU:

Just to -- just to start with

12

the latter part of your question, Your Honor, the -- the

13

statute, as is often the case, is not the most carefully

14

drafted.

15

holding of this Court in Kloeckner is that mixed cases

16

go to the MSPB.

There is no question -- in fact, the direct

17
18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
Kloeckner --

19

MR. LANDAU:

But putting aside

language --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. LANDAU:

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- of the statute --

Right.
-- if you could just help

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12

me with that.

2

MR. LANDAU:

3

Well, I -- the -- there is no question, even

Sure, sure.

4

before Kloeckner, that the statute sends cases of

5

discrimination -- basically, cases go from --

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I would have thought cases

7

of discrimination under Federal discrimination statutes

8

are cases of discrimination under Federal discrimination

9

statutes --

10

MR. LANDAU:

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12
13

Right.
-- and not civil service

disputes.
MR. LANDAU:

Right.

They call them that.

14

You are absolutely right.

15

that in the statute.

16

title of 7702, Your Honor, it has -- I'm looking here --

17

it's called Actions Involving Discrimination.

18

The case -- it calls them

But if you look, then, at the

So 7703, which I think is what you are

19

referring to, 70 -- the exact language in 7703(b)(2),

20

cases of discrimination subject to the provisions, I

21

believe that's the language you just read --

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

MR. LANDAU:

24

And then it sends you, though, shall be

25

Shall be filed under --

Shall be filed, right.

filed -- you know, subject to the provisions of 7702

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

shall be filed under -- and -- and what that is really

2

saying is you file those cases as a standalone

3

complaint; in other words, you are not seeking review of

4

agency action at that point.

5

cases of discrimination -- and, again, when you go to

6

the title of 7702, it's called Actions involving

7

discrimination.

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

MR. LANDAU:

10
11
12

When you have one of these

Right.

So 70 --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But why -- I'm sorry for

taking up so much time, I apologize.
My last question:

Why does "subject to"

13

mean it has to meet the standards of 7702 rather than

14

it's a claim that's subject to the test of 7702?

15

MR. LANDAU:

Well, it is.

I guess it -- it

16

all sends you to the same place, though, that you all --

17

I think the point is that when you have a discrimination

18

claim, you wind up in district court.

19

of the statute -- 7703(b)(2) sends you to 7702(a)(1) --

20

or 7702, and those are the actions involving

21

discrimination.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I think the text

But it's always only

23

actions of discrimination filed under Federal

24

discrimination statutes.

25

MR. LANDAU:

But what we're talk -- right,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

because you have a claim on that.

2

about such cases -- such claims within the contour of a

3

mixed case, which is also a case that involves a civil

4

service claim.

5

But we're talking

It seems to me there could have been two

6

ways to set up this regime.

7

where all the civil service claims go to the Federal

8

Circuit, and all the discrimination cases go straight to

9

district court.

You could have had a regime

But the Congress decided that it wanted

10

to event -- prevent claim splitting.

11

employees -- because they often come -- often employees

12

have the same -- have both of these, and it wanted to

13

create a regime, a sensible, efficient regime that would

14

allow employees to bring them together.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it wanted

Can I ask you a question

16

about the language of 7702(a)(1)(A) and (B), which is

17

the provision that specifies the jurisdiction of the

18

MSPB.

19

So, subparagraph A says: --

20

MR. LANDAU:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

Yes, sir.
-- "Has been affected by

action."

23

MR. LANDAU:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

"Alleges that a basis for the action."

Right.
And subparagraph B says,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

So what should I read into the different language used

2

in those provisions?

3

concerns allegations, but it -- A doesn't say alleges

4

that he has been affected by.

5

affected -- in fact, affected by.

6

The second one, B, certainly

MR. LANDAU:

It says, has been maybe

Your Honor, you are exactly

7

right.

8

negative inference from the absence of the word

"alleges" in A, and, you know, I think that, in truth,

10

The government says that you should draw a

is their strongest textual argument.

11

But --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13
14

What's -- what's wrong with

it?
MR. LANDAU:

But what's wrong with it is, as

15

this Court reiterated as recently as SW General last

16

month, whenever you're talking about this kind of

17

negative implication, it has to be a sensible one, and

18

you have to ensure, as a Court, that Congress really

19

wanted to say no to the other one.

20

the text and structure of the statute tell us that --

21

that the A has to refer to allegations.

22

As we said in our brief, there's another provision,

23

7513(d), that says -- and it -- excuse me.

24

an employee against whom an action is taken under this

25

section is entitled to appeal to the Board.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I think here,

7513(d) says

That,

Official - Subject to Final Review

16

again, has to be an allegation.

2

course, the way our law generally works.

3

out in our brief, the Federal question statute doesn't

4

say alleges.

5

question.

6

And -- and that is, of
As we pointed

It just says if you have a Federal

Our proposition is very much that Congress

7

legislates against the backdrop of what I'll call the

8

Bell v. Hood principle, that when -- that the

9

jurisdiction of an adjudicatory body is triggered by

10

allegations, and the ultimate failure of those

11

allegations on the merits doesn't retroactively strip

12

that body of jurisdiction.

13

to which you've alluded and to which the government

14

makes the point is not enough to say to Congress to

15

throw that all out the window and to create a scheme

16

where it sends you -- going back to Justice Kennedy's

17

first question -- on this kind of needless frolic and

18

detour to the Federal Circuit --

is true.

saying we lose -- everybody agrees that we have the

8

ultimate right, we will ultimately wind up in district

9

court on the discrimination claim.

10

But that is not a reason to say that we should
You -- it -- it

So the real question is, did Congress create

11

a regime where, on the way to the district court, you

12

have to go way up to the Federal Circuit to adjudicate

13

just this one appealability question.

14

that, we think, in light of the text is no.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the answer to

You -- you're being generous

16

to the government, Mr. Landau.

17

it's only by regulation that they will toll the

18

discrimination claim and that they could get rid of that

19

regulation tomorrow.

20

would not be tolled, and you could run out of time on

21

it; isn't that right?

22

The government says that

And then the discrimination claim

MR. LANDAU:

I think even you are being

23

generous to the government, Justice Kagan, because I

24

think they say that some of these regulations don't even

25

necessarily apply, and they even invoke equitable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

tolling in one of the footnotes to their brief.

2

I think some of the regulations in -- refer to 7702, and

3

their whole theory says that 7702 never comes into play

4

at all if the MSPB ultimately concludes that the suit --

5

the civil service action fails on the merits, if you

6

don't have the appealable civil service action.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Because

Mr. Landau, does that not

8

suggest that this detour to the Federal Circuit may not

9

be what's prescribed by the statute and that, again,

10

bifurcation should take place and discrimination claims

11

should go to the district court in the first instance --

12

MR. LANDAU:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We -- well --- rather than hang around

14

waiting in the Federal Circuit?

15

with a regulation that might or might not say that those

16

are tolled?

17

MR. LANDAU:

Hopefully -- hopefully,

But, Your Honor, I -- I think

18

the point is bifurcation -- you are absolutely correct

19

that the statute -- or -- or let me make clear -- the

20

statute wants to avoid bifurcation by allowing employees

21

to bring these claims together.

22

that is one of the --

In other words, that --

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

My question is just where.

24

MR. LANDAU:

Oh.

25

Oh.

Well, I think the

question is, if you look at 7703(b)(1), it says --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

it's -- it's call -- 7703 is judicial review of

2

decisions of the MSPB.

3

provided in subparagraph (B) and paragraph (2) of this

4

subsection, they go to the Federal Circuit.

5

And then it says, except as

So the background rule is that all appeals

from MSPB decisions go to the Federal Circuit, but

7

the -- the exception is what's important here.

8

exception is cases of discrimination, so that's

9

suggesting that you have cases of discrimination that

are before the MSPB.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

MR. LANDAU:

13

this, are cases that can still be --

Cases of discrimination?

Discrimination, subject to all

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

MR. LANDAU:

Keep going.

Keep going.

-- subject to the provisions of

16

section 7702 of this title, shall be filed under section

17

717(c).

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

MR. LANDAU:

Right.

Right.

But -- but the -- so

20

you have to look, what is a case of discrimination

21

subject to the provisions of Section 7702 of this title?

22
23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You also have to ask what

are cases of discrimination filed under 717, right?

24

MR. LANDAU:

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Correct.
And those are classic

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

discrimination claims that are filed in Federal district

2

court.

3

MR. LANDAU:

Correct.

Correct.

And so

4

that -- I -- I think I am maybe emphatically agreeing

5

with you and --

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

MR. LANDAU:

8

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10

MR. LANDAU:

Okay.

I hope so.
Good.

I hope so, too.

I'm not really sure.

I -- I -- I think I am.

I

11

think -- again, I think everybody agrees that when you

12

have a case of discrimination, it has to go to wind up

13

in district court.

14

question here really is that the government insists that

15

under --

16

I think, you know, the -- the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The question is where is

17

the detour to the Federal Circuit that you also

18

anticipate and seem to agree can happen.

19
20
21

MR. LANDAU:

No, we don't.

I'm -- I'm

sorry.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but you say -- the

22

question is whether it's tolled while it's sitting in

23

the Federal Circuit.

24
25

MR. LANDAU:

No, no, no.

I -- I do -- I was

asked a question whether or not the tolling was enough

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

to -- the government's position basically is that the

2

tolling is enough to say that you shouldn't worry about

3

going to the Federal Circuit because the discrimination

4

claim will be tolled.

5

Our point is, okay.

The -- that somewhat

6

solves the government problem, but you shouldn't have to

7

go to the Federal Circuit at all.

We're not the ones

8

pushing the tolling by any means.

I'm sorry if I was

9

not clear on that.

That's the government's theory.

10

Because the government, instead of having a case, what

11

they want to do is have two disembodied claims that are

12

somehow floating around together, and they concede that

13

the Federal Circuit can only address the civil service

14

claim.

15

But our point is, this isn't individual

16

claims.

17

Congress has joined and they are trying to rend them

18

asunder, and to have these disembodied things going to

19

separate places, and -- and that, I think, is the -- the

20

heart of it here.

21

These are cases -- these are mixed cases that

Again, I think that the critical -- the

22

critical point here is that the word "jurisdiction" is

23

being misused.

24

that if the -- if there weren't even allegations on the

25

face of the complaint, that that would be a -- that that

I don't think anybody would disagree

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

would give rise to a serious civil -- civil service

2

action.

3

I think the problem here is that the Board is making

4

a -- the classic kind of mistake that this Court has for

5

20 years been trying to correct, of the profligate use

6

of the word "jurisdiction."

7

decide on the merits -- for instance, in this case, they

8

decided the settlement here was voluntary, so you gave

9

up all your claims.

That is a jurisdictional problem.

And it is saying, when we

That is a substantive determination

10

of the merits.

11

jurisdictional.

12

whole mess, that the Board is calling these decisions

13

that are actually substantive, jurisdictional.

14

The Board is labeling that determination
That's what's getting us into this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Does that

15

mean that a finding that this suspension or furlough

16

wasn't of the required number of days, is that

17

jurisdictional?

18

this situation involving a settlement agreement is not

19

actually jurisdictional?

Are you -- or are you just arguing that

20

MR. LANDAU:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But as long as the

person thinks the Board can hear this?

4

MR. LANDAU:

Well, as long as the person

5

alleges that, just as you can -- in Bell v. Hood, a

6

person brought what turned out to be a Bivens claim in

7

1946, and this Court said there is jurisdiction over

that claim.

9

merits, which it did in 1946, is not a reason to say

10

The fact that the claim fails on the

that there was not jurisdiction.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a strange use of

12

the word "merits," because generally, merits is an

13

adjudication of the actual claim, i.e., I was

14

discriminated against or I was furloughed improperly,

15

not that a Board doesn't have the power to hear

16

something.

17
18

That's generally considered a merits -MR. LANDAU:

But, see, I think the Board did

have the power to -- to hear that.

19

Well, look, it is --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're absolutely right.

21

Every court has -- or every entity has the power to

problem to this argument.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How does that get

reviewed and by whom?

3

MR. LANDAU:

It gets reviewed in district

court.

5

Justice Gorsuch asked earlier, that the standards of

6

review is oddly written in 7703 -- I can't remember if

7

it was (c).

And I think this goes back to a question that

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

MR. LANDAU:

(c).

Because it doesn't refer to the

10

district court's standard review of the civil service

11

claim.

12

for cases where mixed cases involve substantive civil

13

service issues and procedural civil service issues, and

14

everybody agrees that those go to district court.

15

So we're not asking this Court to break any new ground.

16

It's --

But, of course, just to be clear, that is true

17
18
19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, just to continue to

make it up.
MR. LANDAU:

Well, no.

I mean, just -- Your

20

Honor, again, I think the fact that it's not there just

21

doesn't -- doesn't mean that it's not supposed to,

22

because the statutory scheme --

Just because it's not

MR. LANDAU:

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

3

MR. LANDAU:

It's not there.
All right.

But then the part -- again, you

4

face a textual imperative cutting both ways, because the

5

text clearly does send some of the -- send these mixed

6

cases to district court in cases involving

7

discrimination claims.

8
9

So the question, then, is, what standard of
review should apply to the civil service component of

10

the mixed case when it arrives in district court.

11

believe that was Justice Sotomayor's question.

12

I

And -- and the answer to that is all the

13

courts that have addressed the issue, have held that it

14

is the same arbitrary and capricious standard of review

15

that applies to agency action, generally, and that the

16

Federal Circuit would apply to this, because -- because

17

you are reviewing agency action.

18

With respect to the civil service claim, the adjudicator

19

is -- the main adjudicator is that the -- the Board

20

and -- you're just getting agency review of that.

21

the civil -- with a discrimination claim, the main

22

adjudicator is, in fact, the district court, and you're

just exhausting on your way there.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

5
6

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Federal Circuit generally has exclusive
jurisdiction to review the MSPB's decisions.

But

10

Section 7703(b)(2) carves out an exception that sends

11

mixed cases to the district court.

12

That exception doesn't apply here, because

13

the Board concluded the Petitioner does not have a mixed

14

case, and then dismissed without deciding anything else.

15

As a result, Petitioner, unlike the plaintiff in

16

Kloeckner, is not seeking to bring a mixed case into the

17

Federal courts.

Instead, he's seeking --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's what -Go ahead.

That's what the -- the Board

21

says, but we don't know that, right?

22

district court to make exactly that determination?

23

MR. FLETCHER:

Isn't it for the

Well, I think what the Board

24

said is that he doesn't have a mixed case, and that has

25

shaped what he is asking the courts to decide.

Alderson Reporting Company

So he is

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

not seeking further processing on his mixed case.

2

wants a Federal court, either the district court or the

3

Federal Circuit.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

He still -- he still thinks

5

he has civil service claims, in addition to

6

discrimination claims.

7

MR. FLETCHER:

He

And the only thing he wants

8

the court to do, and I think this is clearest on page 18

9

of the reply brief, he wants whichever court it is,

10

either the reviewing court or the district court or the

11

Federal Circuit, to decide to reverse the Board's

12

decision that he didn't suffer an appealable action and

13

send the matter back down to the Board for further

14

proceedings on both his discrimination claims and his

15

civil service claims.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's because the

17

Board didn't -- said that it was not reviewing the

18

merits of his civil service claims.

19

he has civil service claims and discrimination claims,

20

and so he is rejecting the idea that the Board -- the

21

Board has said it's not a mixed case, but he think it's

22

still a mixed case.

23

But he still thinks

And the question is, who decides that?

24

Because if it is a mixed case -- yes.

25

MR. FLETCHER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If he doesn't

So I don't see that,

8

Mr. Fletcher, as addressed by this statutory language

9

that you talk about.

You know, you talk about 7702, and

10

as Justice Alito said, you said (a) says, "has been

11

affected," and (b) says -- alleges that a basis for the

12

action was discrimination.

13

defines a category of cases, these mixed cases, and

14

that's what defines them, that it -- that the employee

15

has been affected by a certain kind of action and makes

16

a certain kind of allegation and it says, well, the

17

Board decides that.

18

afterwards, it goes to the district court.

19

But all 7702 does, is it

And then 7703 says that,

But what is left completely unaddressed in

20

this is the question of who decides whether this is a

21

mixed case as defined by 7702.

22

that.

23

do you think it tells you who decides whether something

24

is a mixed case as defined by 7702?

25

7702 doesn't tell you

It's a -- it's a -- so -- so where in the statute

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, for purposes -- that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

question could come up at different points.

2

question for which it's relevant here is the question,

3

does this appeal go to the Federal Circuit, or does it

4

go to the district court?

5

think there are basically three options for who decides.

6

One option that no one has advocated --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

And for that purposes, I

I'm just asking you -- you

8

know, you point to this language.

9

get you there.

This language doesn't

I'm just asking whether you have other

10

language to point to that suggests that the "who

11

decides" question ought to be in the Federal Circuit.

12

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, let me first take a run

13

at you on this language, because I think what it does

14

say, as Justice Alito pointed out, is that the

15

employee's allegation is sufficient as to the

16

discrimination content --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

MR. FLETCHER:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, it obviously --- but not as to the other.
No, it obviously makes a

20

distinction between allegations and -- and being

21

affected by an action, but only -- all that this

22

provision does is it defines what a mixed case is, and

23

says the -- the Merit System Protection Board will

24

decide that mixed case.

25

And the definition of a mixed case has one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

element, which is an actual thing, and another element,

2

which is an allegation.

3

MR. FLETCHER:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5
6

Yes.
But this is only the

statement that the Board will address mixed cases.
It doesn't say anything about what happens

7

if there's a dispute as to whether there is a mixed

8

case, who gets to decide that question.

9

MR. FLETCHER:

And the only point I'm trying

10

to make is that I think -- it may not answer that

11

question definitively, in your view, but I think the

12

fact -- it cuts against my friend's answer, which is

13

that we should take the employee's word for it; that if

14

the employee alleges he has a mixed case, it ought to be

15

treated as such for purposes of these questions, because

16

the statute makes an allegation sufficient only as to

17

one of two elements.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's -But that's the

20

way -- that's the way the system works, generally.

21

mean, there are all sorts of statutory programs where

22

there are prerequisites to a proceeding.

23

Clean Water Act, you know, you can only proceed if

24

they -- the company is discharging water into navigable

25

waters, but the system always works by the fact -- it

Alderson Reporting Company

I

You know, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

has to start with an allegation.

2

That's the -- you know, the -- the one

3

provision does say "alleges" and the other doesn't, but

4

it's hard to see how -- the -- the system doesn't turn

5

on preexisting facts.

6

you have an allegation, and then you have a response and

7

all that.

8
9
10
11

The way it -- you answer facts is

So I don't think the fact that it -- A did
not use the word "alleges" can really be that
significant.
MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think our system does

12

work that if you have a provision that a tribunal, a

13

court, an agency, whatever, can hear a certain kind of

14

case, by necessity, when someone comes in and claims to

15

have that sort of case, you have to take their word for

16

it; at least insofar as you have to hold proceedings to

17

figure out if they're right.

18

I think our point, though, is that when you

19

have jurisdictional allegations like, say, diversity

20

jurisdiction, or any other number of other

21

jurisdictional elements and you then have factual

22

proceedings or legal proceedings to test the sufficiency

23

of those jurisdictional allegations, if they're found

24

lacking, then the result is that the case is dismissed

25

for lack of jurisdiction.

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and that --

2

and, normally, that you can appeal that, and -- and have

3

a choice to seek a review of it.

4

about matters that are, I think in a majority of the

5

cases, brought pro se.

And you're talking

6

MR. FLETCHER:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's right.
And we've -- we have

8

had -- I won't say difficulty, but we've had a lot of

9

cases trying to decide whether something is

10

jurisdictional or procedural.

11

easy question.

12

filing these things pro se will be able to understand,

13

well, that's jurisdictional, but it may actually be

14

jurisdictional in the sense of being a claims processing

15

rule as opposed to substantive jurisdiction.

16

think you're putting a huge burden on the -- on the

17

system.

18

And it's not always an

MR. FLETCHER:

I -- I

things about that.

20

of jurisdiction in the abstract.

21

language that this Court focused on in Kloeckner, which

22

says you have a mixed case if you've been subject to the

23

sort of action which you can appeal to the Board.

24

That's all we mean by "jurisdictional."

25

The first is that this is the sort
Our rule turns on the

And the second point, I take your point that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

many of the employees who proceed through this process

2

are pro se, and that's why the process takes steps to

3

protect their rights.

4

At the end of every Board decision is an

5

advisory about appeal rights.

6

case, the Board concludes that it doesn't have a

7

jurisdiction because the action wasn't appealable, it

8

advises the employee that their right to seek review is

9

in the Federal Circuit.

10

And when, as in this

So I take the point that this is a rule that

11

employees may have to handle on their own. But the

12

system helps them through that.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the whole point of this

14

scheme, generally -- and we have said this, and it

15

appears on the face of the statute -- is to make sure

16

that the employee doesn't have to claim-split.

17

And so we've said when the Board dismisses

18

your claim on the merits, you can take it to the

19

district court.

20

your case on procedure, you can take it to the district

21

court.

22

don't have to split it up, do one thing in the Federal

23

Circuit and one thing in the district court.

24
25

And we have said that when it dismisses

You can do everything in the district court, you

And now, for this one category of thing,
which you call "jurisdictional," Mr. Landau says in this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

case it looks an awful lot like a merits determination,

2

but anyway, for this one category of thing, we're going

3

to treat it differently, we're going to insist that you

4

split your claims and -- and not bring the

5

discrimination claim in the Federal Circuit because you

6

can't bring it there, but instead you have to go to the

7

Federal Circuit on your CSRA claim.

MR. FLETCHER:

that this is claim-splitting.

I -- I point to reply brief page 18 where he

explains that if the reviewing court, be it the Federal

Circuit or the district court, concludes that the Board

15

was wrong on the appealability question, both parts of

16

the case are going to go back down to the Board for

further processing.

So this isn't the --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the claim -- it's

19

temporary claims-splitting.

20

to put your -- your discrimination claim on the back

21

burner and proceed with respect only to your civil

22

service claim and decide, you know, whether the -- the

23

board can -- can review that or not.

24

MR. FLETCHER:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's -- you know, you have

Right.

And --

That's a kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

claim-splitting.

2

all get into the same place, but eventually can be can

3

be a long time.

4

discrimination claim may have lapsed by then, and you

5

don't guarantee that it will survive.

6

to me something which is -- is -- you know, really cuts

7

against the way this scheme works in the vast majority

8

of cases, and the way we have said it should.

9

I mean, you can say eventually it will

And as I said before, your

MR. FLETCHER:

And so that seems

But I think the only thing --

10

none of that is unique to our rule.

11

Petitioner's rule, you're going to have a threshold

12

dispute about was this an action appealable to the

13

board.

14

there's going to be a detour to the district court to

15

decide that threshold dispute.

16

court concludes that the employee did not have an

17

appealable action, then the employee is going to need

18

some sort of tolling rule or something to forgive the --

19

the missing of a regulatory deadline, because that

20

employee has not properly exhausted a pure

21

discrimination claim.

I think, even under

Under Petitioner's rule, that threshold dispute,

22

So I think I --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if the district

All right.

May I ask

24

you that question.

25

in your brief until I got to footnote 3 on page 23.

I -- I was following your argument

Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

know which one I'm referring to?

2

MR. FLETCHER:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I do.
So there is -- you're

4

saying that the regulations that provide, essentially,

5

for tolling, that there's no statutory basis for them.

6

Are you saying -- or at least not --

7

MR. FLETCHER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10
11

Not 7702(f), yes.
Are you saying that

there isn't another one, or that this regulation is open
to challenge, and if it is, then nothing gets tolled?
MR. FLETCHER:

No, certainly not.

I think

12

the general rule -- the EEOC has general rule-making

13

authority for the processing of federal employment

14

discrimination claims, including mixed cases through the

15

administrative process.

16

It's general rule, even apart from the

17

particular one that we're relying on here, is that

18

deadlines are subject to tolling and waiver and other

19

sorts of provisions.

20

the specific authority in 7702(f), there would be room

21

for a tolling rule like this one.

22

And so I think, even apart from

I think the Ninth Circuit's decision in

23

Sloan v. West, which is one of the early pre-Kloeckner

24

cases that looked at this question, concluded that this

25

sort of tolling would be required as a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

equitable tolling.

2

So again, on the tolling issue, I think

3

either side is going to need some sort of tolling rule,

4

and I think there's plenty of room to make that sort of

5

tolling rule once it gets sorted out, which forum the

6

employee --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is odd, though.

8

It is odd that the only category of cases that you say

9

has to go to the Federal Circuit through the MSPB are

10

the cases in which the MSPB thinks they don't have

11

jurisdiction.

12

MR. FLETCHER:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -You have two cases

14

here, and one was come together, and the one they say,

15

no, no, that's got to go to the MSPB and the -- I mean,

16

that's got to go to the Federal Circuit because we need

17

uniformity are the cases where they don't think there is

18

a claim under the Civil Service Act.

19

MR. FLETCHER:

I -- I actually think I

20

understand that that may seem logical from -- from one

21

angle.

22

you think about why Congress made the exception for

23

mixed cases to begin with.

24
25

I actually think it makes a lot of sense when

Generally, all board decisions go to the
Federal Circuit because we want uniformity, we want the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

efficiency of just a single layer of judicial review.

2

We carve out mixed cases because those cases include

3

claims of discrimination.

4

trial de novo on their discrimination claims, and you

5

obviously can't get that in the Federal Circuit.

6

Employees have a right to

But here -- and again, I go back to the

7

nature of the question that the employee is presenting

8

to the Court:

9

there will be a trial de novo.

10

question:

11

It is not a discrimination claim on which
It is just the discrete

Is this an appealable action?
Everyone agrees that that question is just a

12

matter of Federal Civil Service law, of the sort that

13

the Federal Circuit answers every day in non-mixed

14

cases, and that district courts rarely, if ever, answer.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then why -So that label,

17

jurisdictional -- I mean, as I see it, the -- and the

18

employee says, these adverse actions were taken against

19

me, I was suspended, and then I was forced into early

20

retirement.

21

Those are adverse actions.
And then the MSPB said, but you surrendered

22

those claims.

23

like a defense.

24

jurisdictional.

25

That's ordinarily like a release.

It's

I don't see how it gets to be

MR. FLETCHER:

I think this is most clearly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

laid out on page 4A of the Petitioner Appendix in the

2

D.C. Circuit's opinion.

3

general view, which has been upheld by the Federal

4

Circuit, is that a voluntarily-accepted action is not an

5

adverse action that's subject to the Board's

6

jurisdiction.

7

It explains that the board's

So here, take the resignation.

8

facially resigned or retired his employment.

9

only has jurisdiction over removal.

Petitioner
The board

And so the board

10

has said, ordinarily, obviously, we wouldn't have

11

jurisdiction over retirement, but if you can show that

12

you were coerced into retiring, we'll treat that like a

13

constructive removal, within our authority to hear;

14

we'll treat that like an appealable action.

15

And I think the -- the rule that's at issue

16

here -- and I just want to point out, even if you don't

17

agree with me on this, that's not really the question

18

presented in this case.

19

the premise that this was decided on appealability

20

grounds.

21

The case comes to the Court on

And even if you disagree that this

22

particular ground is, in fact, an appealability ground,

23

lots of them are.

24

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, where there's a question

25

about was this a suspension of more than 14 days or not,

Lots of them may be the cases, like

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

or is this an employee who is entitled to civil service

2

protections or not.

3

So the --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Fletcher, the -- the one

5

thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me

6

is that nobody who is not a lawyer, and no ordinary

7

lawyer could read these statutes and figure out what

8

they are supposed to do.

9

(Laughter.)

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

And this isn't -- this isn't

your fault.

12

Now we'll decide this case, and that will

13

make things clearer.

14

questions.

15

Can't something -- can't something be done about this?

There still will be all sorts of

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

This is a case that's about,

18

at bottom, not very much substantively, right?

19

matter which side wins, Mr. Perry will, in the end, get

20

a decision if he wants it in the district court on both

21

of the questions.

22

MR. FLETCHER:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

up this?

No

Yes.
So what can be done to clear

This is unbelievably complicated.
MR. FLETCHER:

I'm not going to fight your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

point that this is a complicated statutory scheme, or

2

your point that it's going to remain so whatever the

3

Court does with this case.

4

doing the best that they can by providing Notices of

5

Appeal rights.

6

I think the agencies are

And here, you know, Petitioner was advised

7

your appeal right lies in the Federal Circuit, here's

how to file that appeal, here's the deadline for filing

JUSTICE ALITO:

Somebody who --

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

Who wrote -- who wrote this

-- takes pleasure out of

pulling the wings off flies?

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. FLETCHER:

I think Congress was trying

18

to balance and mesh together two systems, the Civil

19

Service system and the anti -- and the federal

20

discrimination laws.

21

And it will find --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the way --

22

the way you end up, though, is a situation where,

23

peculiarly, the MSPB has jurisdiction because uniformity

24

is desirable in a particular area.

25

doesn't have -- it can't enforce uniformity as a matter

Alderson Reporting Company

Even though it

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

of substantive law, and we held in Kloeckner it can't

2

enforce uniformity as a matter of procedural laws.

3

And you made these arguments in Kloeckner

4

and lost on procedure, and now you're saying, well,

5

jurisdiction is different so we can make the same

6

arguments there.

7

In terms of accessibility of the statute,

8

and simplicity, it would seem wiser to prevent that type

9

of, you know, splitting the -- well, whatever.

10

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I -- I don't think --

11

the Court did reject those arguments in Kloeckner.

12

think it rejected them, though -- I'm not going to tell

13

the Court what it meant in Kloeckner.

14

footnote 4 of the opinion, it doesn't say -- it doesn't

15

deny that Congress was interested in uniformity and an

16

efficiency judicial review, it just says that the text

17

foreclosed the argument we were making in Kloeckner.

18

We --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

As I read

Could you please tell

20

me, besides this voluntary settlement issue, what else

21

is jurisdictional?

22

doesn't match 7512, the furlough and suspension?

What else besides something that

23

MR. FLETCHER:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Right.
So if we go down your

route, and I'm writing that opinion -- which I hope not,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

but if I were --

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What -- what would I

4

tell the practicing bar about what the board labels as

5

jurisdictional really counts as jurisdictional?

6

MR. FLETCHER:

I think you would tell them

7

that it's yolked to the text that this focused on in

8

Kloeckner, which is Section 7702(a)(1), which says that

9

to be a mixed case, you have to have been affected by an

10
11

action which you can appeal to the board.
And in Elgin, this Court explained that the

12

actions that you can appeal to the board generally are

13

determined by the kind of action which you've suffered,

14

a removal or suspension and so forth, and the kind of

15

employee that you are:

16

Are you preference-eligible?

17

category that's entitled to these protections and given

18

rights to appeal to the board.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. FLETCHER:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you a -- a civil servant?
Are you otherwise in a

That's what's -So there's --

-- mean by --- a whole lot of cases

22

23

to do with whether you're a defined employee or not.

24
25

MR. FLETCHER:

There's also cases having

That -- that's right.

think 7512 only applied to certain categories of

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

46

employee.

2

is that Congress might have wanted to keep these

3

questions in the Federal Circuit.

4

And I think that gets to the point of why it

And this gets back to your question,

5

Mr. Chief Justice.

6

cases Congress sacrificed that interest in uniformity

7

because it wanted to pursue other values, because it

8

wanted to protect employees' rights to trial de novo.

9

It's absolutely right that in some

And the -- the point that I want to get to

10

here is that the particular type of dispute at issue

11

here, an appealability dispute, doesn't implicate those

12

reasons that caused Congress to sacrifice uniformity in

13

other contexts.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Fletcher, when we're

15

talking about folks knowing where to go and making it

16

easier on them, can you help me with the same question I

17

had for Mr. Landau?

18

talks about cases of discrimination filed under Federal

19

discrimination laws go to district court, and everything

20

else goes to the Federal Circuit.

Which is (b)(2), as I read it,

21

Now, that would be a nice clean rule; right?

22

Individuals would know that their civil service disputes

23

go to the Federal Circuit and discrimination claims go

24

to district court.

25

statute on standards of review for the district court if

We have to add a lot of words to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

they're going to be reviewing administrative actions.

2

We have to ignore the standard of review that is

3

prescribed by the statute for the district court de novo

4

when it comes to certain claims that would come before

5

them.

6

as well, and a regulation that may or may not say what

7

the government says it says.

We have to worry about all this equitable tolling

8
9
10

Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we just
followed the -- the plain text of the statute?

What am

I missing?

11

MR. FLETCHER:

So I -- I think it might be a

12

simpler system, but it would be a system that would

13

require the sort of claim-splitting that Justice Kagan

14

referred to earlier in a much more serious way.

15

I think also I agree with you that the

16

statute doesn't expressly provide for district courts to

17

decide civil service claims.

18

read -- it's not elegantly drafted -- but I think it's

19

fairly read to allow that.

20

of reasons --

I think it's fairly

And let me give you a couple

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22

MR. FLETCHER:

23

Where?

Let me give you a couple

reasons --

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

MR. FLETCHER:

Where?

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1
2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Not reasons.

Where in the

language?

3

MR. FLETCHER:

4

So we start with the general rule that says

Absolutely.

5

you -- in Section 7703(b)(1) that says, "Except as

6

provided in paragraph 2, a petition to review a final

7

order or a final decision of the Board shall be filed in

8

the Federal Circuit."

9

The provision that we've been talking about

10

that says you can bring a discrimination case in

11

district court is an exception to that rule, which

12

suggests to me that what you're doing is seeking a

13

review of the Board's decision, which, of course,

14

included civil service claims.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It doesn't say that.

It

16

says -- the except clause says, "Cases of discrimination

17

filed under Federal discrimination laws."

18

it says.

19

MR. FLETCHER:

That's what

But let me -- let me just

20

quote the language.

21

subject to the provisions of Section 7702 of this title

22

shall be filed under the applicable antidiscrimination

23

laws."

24
25

It says, "Cases of discrimination

A case of discrimination subject to 7702 is
defined as a mixed case that includes both

Alderson Reporting Company

49
1

discrimination and other components.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

3

MR. FLETCHER:

4

Where?

In Section 7702 itself, where

it says a case of discrimination subject to --

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But that -- that just

6

raises the question what "subject to" means, right?

7

And -- and you're equating "subject to" with "meeting

8

the test of."

9

to.

But "subject to" can also mean subject

It can be tested under.

Not that it meets the

10

test, but it can be tested under, right?

11

how Congress uses that phrase.

12

MR. FLETCHER:

That's often

I -- I understand.

I -- I

13

may not be grasping in that sense.

14

you might use it to say this is true, subject to some

15

other provision that might qualify it.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

17

MR. FLETCHER:

18
19

Congress used it here.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:
not that it does qualify.

21

MR. FLETCHER:

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

24
25

Right.

I don't think that's how

20

23

I understand that

It may or may not qualify,

I guess -Often, it's used in that

sense, right?
MR. FLETCHER:

I -- I'm not sure that it --

I -- I can agree with that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

just gave me a good example.

3

MR. FLETCHER:

Really?

Why not?

You

Then I think maybe I'm

4

misunderstanding the question.

5

Congress says the rule is you go to district court,

6

subject to, in this case, you can go to some other

7

tribunal.

8
9
10
11
12

So it's describing an exception.
I think that that's not what it's doing

here.

Here, it's using that as a description -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. FLETCHER:

Kloeckner, which I think

says, you know, this is a --

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

Do you have any authority

for that proposition?

13

15

I -- I agree sometimes

Besides Kloeckner.

Anything else?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Kloeckner certainly

17

says it, but beyond Kloeckner, I mean, merits cases

18

that -- that have been -- have been going to district

19

court for years prior to Kloeckner; isn't that right?

20

MR. FLETCHER:

That's right.

Kloeckner, in

21

footnote 4, said that in the Federal Circuit's decision

22

in Williams in 1983, which is sort of the first that

23

decided this.

24

then has followed it.

25

And every court that I'm aware of since

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

This would be a kind

Official - Subject to Final Review

of revolution, I mean, in -- in -- to the extent that

2

you can have a revolution in this kind of case.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. FLETCHER:

5

It would be a big change,

yes.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So when it goes to the

7

district court -- well, here, first, you could go to the

8

district court at the beginning.

9

discrimination, but then you can't bring the civil

10

You can treat it as

service part.

11

So now we want to bring both.

And we go to

12

the MSPB.

13

take an appeal and we go -- we have to go to the Federal

14

Circuit --

And then we -- okay.

15

MR. FLETCHER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, again, we -- we

Uh-huh.
-- and in -- in the MSPB.

17

We then can -- if they kept it for 120 days more, we go

18

right to the district court.

19

the way, if they decide against us, we go right to the

20

district court.

21

Remember that.

Then, by

Remember that.

Now, in the two cases I said to remember,

22

when the district court has them, does the district

23

court decide both the discrimination issue and does it

24

review the civil service issue?

25

MR. FLETCHER:

So in our view, the answer to

that question has to be yes.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Otherwise, you're going to

bounce, bounce, bounce.

4

MR. FLETCHER:

I don't think that's right.

5

I think those are -- those are provisions that you've

6

described that give the employees options to

7

short-circuit the administrative process in the district

8

court.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no.

I -- no, you're

10

not following me.

11

saying your answer has to be right, because, otherwise,

12

you again get the civil service part -- I mean, the

discrimination part done.

14

the Board again and it would never end.

15

employee, who is already hungry and thirsty and been

going on for quite a while, would just have another

And it says that if an

So just as a matter of pure

8

simplicity, if we could get there, why, if they're going

9

to decide in the district court, I guess, under an

10

ordinary AD-law set of standards, they're going to

11

decide in the district court the civil service claim as

12

well, and you will have nonuniformity in a whole bunch

13

of cases where the MPSB decided no, why not bring this

14

one in too?

15

added uniform -- it -- it -- there's no more

16

disuniformity than there is in any of the other cases.

17

And all that you have here are just what he said on

18

jurisdiction.

19

Because this one in too would give you the

What this case is really about is whether

20

there was a voluntary departure from the -- from the

21

civil service or whether he was really fired.

22

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think, Justice

23

Breyer, taking this sort of decision, this appealability

24

determination is going to take and introduce

25

disuniformity into a whole nother category of issues,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

55
1

like those I was discussing with Justice Sotomayor, and

2

it's going to do it for no good reason.

3

are issues that are going to be -- they're pure civil

4

service issues.

5

record before the MSPB with no de novo fact-finding --

6

Because those

They're going to be adjudicated on the

Yeah, JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

I see that.

7

But it isn't no good reason.

8

cutting out the extra loop, the very reason that you

9

have the district court make the AD-law decision in the

10

The reason is you're

cases where the MPSB decided against the employee.

11

So the reasoning is the same.

12

is, I grant you, that much more, but that much more is

13

not a distinction of principle.

14

MR. FLETCHER:

It is -- it

But I -- I think it is,

15

Justice Breyer.

16

it's decided the civil service claims; it's decided the

17

discrimination claims.

18

those are going to have to be decided in district court,

19

so take all of them to district court, even though there

20

is some loss of uniformity.

21

When the MSPB has decided the case,

It makes sense to say some of

It doesn't make sense, whereas here, you

22

have this threshold appealability question that comes up

23

before the MSPB addresses the merits of either of the

24

questions.

25

that question.

And some court is going to have to decide
Some court -- there's going to have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

be a detour to some court at that threshold of the

2

administrative process to decide if the MSPB was right

3

not to let it proceed further.

4

And in our view, it makes a lot more sense

5

to send that to the Federal Circuit, which decides those

6

questions all the time and which can do it in one layer

7

of judicial review.

8
9

Because, otherwise --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

Might

want to -- ahead.

10

MR. FLETCHER:

I was just going to finish

11

out the thought that under my friend's view, at that

12

threshold point, you go to the district court.

13

the employee doesn't like what the district court does

14

or the government doesn't like what the district court

15

does, you potentially have another layer of review in

16

the regional circuit before you can even get to a

17

conclusion about whether or not this was a matter that

18

was properly before the MSPB.

19

And if

In our view, it goes to the court that has a

20

body of law that decides this all the time, and it can

21

put it on the right track administratively much faster.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said there has

23

to be a detour either way.

24

detour in the MSPB to the Federal Circuit under your

25

view.

I understand there's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

MR. FLETCHER:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

other detour?

4

the district court.

5

Yes.
But where is the

I thought the other route was straight to

MR. FLETCHER:

It's straight to the district

6

court, but keep in mind -- and, again, this is page 18

7

of Petitioner's reply brief -- what he's asking the

8

district court to do.

9

please review the MSPB's decision that I didn't suffer

10

He's saying:

an appealable action --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. FLETCHER:

13

District court,

Right.

-- reverse it, and send it

back to the MSPB for further proceedings.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think he has to ask

15

that?

16

said, I'd like the district court just to decide this.

17

Could he do that?

18

Suppose he asked something else.

MR. FLETCHER:

Suppose he

I don't think he could.

I

19

certainly don't think he could for the civil service

20

claims, because those are claims that have to be decided

21

by the board in the first instance.

22

Chenery-type standards. So the administrative review --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They're subject to

There are times where the

24

district court does it without the Board's doing it

25

first, right?

When the Board -- when the time period

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1
2

lapses?
MR. FLETCHER:

It's not in our view, but

3

that's the contested issue, where some -- some courts do

4

allow that to happen, but in -- but in our view, it --

5

it ought not happen.

6

And I think, in addition, you know, to -- to

7

-- to make the point, I think, my friend has suggested

8

that some of the efficiency, from his view, actually

9

happens when the employee is wrong, when you go to the

10

district court and the district court says, no, the MSPB

11

was correct, this is not an appealable action, what you

12

have is a pure discrimination case.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I take my --

What happens if he went

14

to the district court and said, I don't care about the

15

Board deciding this issue, voluntary or not voluntary, I

16

just want to pursue the -- the discrimination claim?

17

MR. FLETCHER:

I think if that's what he --

18

if that's what he wants, he should not seek review of

19

the Board's decision at all, because the regulation that

20

we talked about earlier, 1614.302(b) positions him.

21

he just acquiesces in the Board's decision to go exhaust

22

his administrative -- his discrimination claim through

23

the ordinary administrative process, through the agency

24

EEO, and then through the EEOC, if he wants it.

25

then he can go straight to district court.

Alderson Reporting Company

If

And

So if that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

what he wants, he doesn't have to do this at all.

2

we're here because what he wants is MSPB review of his

3

claim.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

So under your

5

theory, the problem is that if you don't go to the MS --

6

if you don't go to the Federal Circuit, the district

7

court, it will all get mucked up in the CSRA business

8

because they can't go ahead and decide it, you have to

9

wait, and it has to go back later because of Chenery

10

issues and the like.

11

And the other side is, well, if -- if you go

12

to the -- if you have to go your route, it's the

13

discrimination claim that gets all mucked up, because it

14

may have -- you may need to toll the complaints, the

15

exhaustion issue may be complicated.

16

either way, right?

17

MR. FLETCHER:

I think, though -- I think he

18

has our problem, too.

19

you have with his, but he has --

20

So it's a problem

We -- we solve the problem that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

By -- by the tolling

21

and allowing them to start over again?

22

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes, because -- but you need

23

that, too, even if you send these cases to the district

24

court.

25

MSPB, and says, you didn't have an appealable action,

Because if the district court agrees with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

60
1

first of all, the government is going to have a very

2

strong argument that he hasn't exhausted his

3

administrative remedies because he hasn't.

4

And, second of all, in those circumstances,

5

the employee may not want to proceed in district court.

6

Very often federal employees who have discrimination

7

claims want to get reviewed before an administrative

8

body, like the MSPB or the EEOC, because it's easier to

9

litigate there.

10

And so here, if -- if he goes to district

11

court, and the district court says, the MSPB was right,

12

you don't have an appealable action, you're not entitled

13

to further proceedings in the MSPB, many employees in

14

that circumstance might decide that they don't want to

15

pursue further proceedings in the district court.

16

might decide, I want to go back and avail myself of my

17

administrative remedies.

18

They

And what our rule does is it gets you a

19

quick decision from the Federal Circuit on that question

20

that puts the employees in a position to go back and

21

make that election.

22

administrative remedies through the EEOC, or do I want

23

to go ahead and get a final decision from the agency

24

EEO, and proceed directly to district court on a pure

25

discrimination claim?

Do I want to continue to pursue

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

61
1

That's the circumstance he would have been

2

in, if he had just accepted the MSPB's decision.

3

what the regulations provide, if he hadn't appealed.

4

And we think that's the same position that he ought to

5

be in if he goes to a court and seeks review, but is

6

unsuccessful.

7

That's

We -- we actually think it's sort of odd to

8

let an employee who seeks review of the MSPB's decision,

9

and loses, somehow skips some steps of the

10

administrative process, or ends up in a different

11

position than he would have been in if he had just

12

accepted the MSPB's position in the first place.

13

Thank you.

points.

just our interpretation of the statute, it's actually

22

the relevant agency's interpretation of the statute as

23

24

to the regulations, both from the EEOC and from the

25

MSPB, that actually say that the -- interpret the

First, our interpretation of the statute is not

And I omitted in my opening presentation to refer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

62
1

statute just the way we do, that the jurisdiction over a

2

mixed question turns on the allegations and not just the

3

outcome of the -- of the civil service action.

4

For the EEOC regulation, it's 29 C.F.R. 16

5

point -- 1614.302(a)(2), and from the MSPB perspective,

6

it's 5 C.F.R. 1201.151(a)(1).

7

government -- the agencies themselves actually interpret

8

the statute just exactly the way we do.

9

So this is the

The second point I'd like to make is that

10

there was some allusion to this in the questioning of my

11

friend.

12

jurisdictional lines are among the most elusive in the

13

law.

14

decisions is a fool's errand.

15

The -- the procedural substantive

And asking pro se litigants to make these

And there will be -- unless you're to say,

16

as the government seems to suggest, that the MSPB's

17

views on what is jurisdictional is conclusive, and

18

cannot be reviewed, if they say it's jurisdictional, it

19

is jurisdictional, then this Court, presumably, and --

20

will be drowning for years in cases regarding whether or

21

not a particular MSPB action was, in fact, properly

22

characterized as procedural, substantive, or

23

jurisdictional.

24
25

I think our view has the simplicity of
saying, if you made the allegations, regardless of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

63
1

civil service action, regardless of whether or not the

2

agency accepts those allegations, you have a mixed case,

3

that goes to the district court just like procedural

4

dismissals and just like substantive issues, and the

5

district courts handle it.

6

agents -- for affected government employees and agencies

7

and courts to handle.

8

10

That's a simple regime for

And, finally, as this Court said, actually
in announcing Kloeckner, the government's position in
this case is just too complicated to be right.
