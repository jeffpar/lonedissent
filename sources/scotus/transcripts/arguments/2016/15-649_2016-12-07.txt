Ms. Spinelli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. SPINELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Chapter 11 provides one way to distribute

12

estate assets to creditors on account of their

13

prepetition claims through a confirmed plan that adheres

14

to the code's priority scheme.

15

can't be confirmed, the bankruptcy court can convert the

16

case to Chapter 7, which also requires that creditors be

17

paid in order of priority, or it can simply dismiss the

18

case without distributing assets to creditors at all,

19

returning all parties to their prebankruptcy position.

20

If a Chapter 11 plan

No provision of the Bankruptcy Code permits

21

what happened here:

22

case that distributed all the estate's assets to

23

creditors, but deliberately skipped over our clients'

24

priority claims.

25

an order dismissing a Chapter 11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May I ask you:

Alderson Reporting Company

Did the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

settlement bar you from suing the debtor for the WARN

2

Act claims?

3

MS. SPINELLI:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, it did not.
And there was no money

5

left to the debtor.

6

Life for a fraudulent transfer, which --

So did it bar you from suing Sun

7

MS. SPINELLI:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MS. SPINELLI:

It did.
It did.

It did, Justice Sotomayor,

10

and I think that's -- that's critical.

11

settlement did is it took away our client's right to

12

pursue either the debtor or Sun and CIT on account of

13

their undisputed WARN Act claims, which were in the area

14

of $12 million.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What this

All right.

In the court

16

below, I understand that the -- that you represented

17

that if this settlement went through, that you would

18

have -- I'm sorry -- that if -- without the settlement,

19

you would really have nothing, because there was no

20

money in the estate.

21

So are you representing that your client

22

intends to sue Sun Life?

23

get money here.

24
25

MS. SPINELLI:

Because that's the only way to

Well, let me -- let me

respond to that, Justice Sotomayor.

Alderson Reporting Company

There are a few

Official - Subject to Final Review

things that could happen if this Court reverses the

2

order below and the case is remanded.

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, that's really up to the

bankruptcy court.

7
8

Tell me

which one you're going to do.

5
6

That's fine.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So what do

you -- are you going to ask them to do?

9

MS. SPINELLI:

What we had asked for before,

10

and what may well make the most sense, is conversion to

11

Chapter 7, in which case either the Chapter 7 trustee

12

could pursue the fraudulent-transfer claim --

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
the estate to do that.

15

But there is no money in

So how will the trustee do that?

MS. SPINELLI:

The trustee would have to

16

retain contingency counsel, and that does happen.

17

involved in a Chapter 7 case where the trustee pursued

18

an avoidance action successfully with contingency

19

counsel.

20

I was

Failing that, if the trustee decided not to

21

do that, after the bankruptcy is over, the

22

fraudulent-transfer claim would revest in the creditors,

23

and our clients could then bring that claim themselves.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

There is a difference --

there seems to be a difference between what you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

said on this point in your briefs and in your argument

2

this morning and what you told the Third Circuit or what

3

-- did you -- did your firm represent -- appear in the

4

Third Circuit?

5
6

MS. SPINELLI:

Not until the rehearing

stage.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in the Third Circuit

8

oral argument, it was said over and over, well, we just

9

want to make sure that the law is filed -- is followed.

10

That's what we are interested in.

11

Isn't that right?

12

MS. SPINELLI:

13

We certainly do want to make

sure that the law is followed.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, we --

If you were pressed as to

15

what practical difference the case meant to you and --

16

and the answer was, we -- you know, we want to uphold

17

the law.

18

MS. SPINELLI:

Justice Alito, I don't

19

believe that's the case.

difference.

21

That's the only reason our clients have been pursuing

22

it.

23

24

account of their undisputed WARN Act claims, which, as

25

of now, they're -- they have been deprived of.

The case does make a practical

It always has made a practical difference.

And the practical difference it makes is that on

JUSTICE ALITO:

But can you point to

2

anything you said in the Third Circuit, in writing or

3

orally, that -- along those lines, that you -- that

4

there was some practical course of action that -- that

5

you -- some tangible thing that you were going to

6

pursue?

7

MS. SPINELLI:

What we told the Third

8

Circuit is that if this case went back on remand and

9

were converted to Chapter 7, then the

10

fraudulent-transfer action could be pursued.

11

that's what -- that's the argument that we made below.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

I believe

Can I ask one other -- one

13

other thing?

14

between the petition stage and the briefing stage in the

15

case.

16

Something strange seems to have happened

The question that you asked us to take was

17

whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the

18

distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that

19

violates the statutory priority scheme.

20

there's a square conflict on that issue, with the Second

21

Circuit and the Third Circuit on one side and the Fifth

22

Circuit on the other side.

And you said

23

MS. SPINELLI:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

But then the question that you address in

Correct.
And we took the case.

Alderson Reporting Company

your brief refers to "structured dismissal."

2

nothing about structured dismissal in the question that

3

you asked us to take, and there is no conflict on the

4

question of structured dismissal, is there?

5

MS. SPINELLI:

There is

And, Justice Alito, we're not

6

asking this Court to decide the question of whether

7

structured dismissals are valid.

8

substance of the question presented here.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

We did not change the

Now, you're not asking us to

10

decide the broad question whether there can ever be a

11

structured dismissal.

12

whether the priorities have to be followed in a

13

structural dismissal, and unless the answer to that

14

question follows from the answer to the question that

15

you presented in your petition, you have changed the

16

question that you have asked us to decide.

17

But you are asking us to decide

MS. SPINELLI:

We did not change the

18

substance of the question presented.

19

we had a paragraph of background explaining that this

20

was done through a structured dismissal.

the question, does the Bankruptcy Code -- may a

22

bankruptcy court authorize the distribution of

23

settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the Code's

priority scheme?

25

In the petition,

We then asked

In the brief, we condensed that a bit so

Those careful, reticulated mechanisms for

the distribution of estate assets foreclose any

No, Justice Kagan.

I think

Separately, there is a distribution of all

19

And that is done in Chapter 11 through

So Congress would not have specified that

20

priority applies to settlements, because settlements are

not a means for distribution of estate assets.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MS. SPINELLI:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

There are three things.

There can --

Only the plan does that.
There can be a dismissal.

Alderson Reporting Company

Two are covered,

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.

2

which means, as I understand it, you -- you return to

3

the preexisting situation.

But this is a dismissal,

4

MS. SPINELLI:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
But -- but now you're

6

saying the -- there are assets, and the Court has to do

7

something about the distribution of those assets.

8
9

MS. SPINELLI:
Ginsburg.

Correct -- correct, Justice

The -- there are -- there are two methods for

10

distributing estate assets contemplated by the corporate

11

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, either a Chapter 11

12

plan or the Chapter 7 distribution set out in Section

13

726, both of which require adherence to priority.

14

A case can also be dismissed.

In that case,

15

there is no distribution of estate assets at all.

16

That's not contemplated in conjunction with a dismissal.

17

Rather, the parties are returned to their prebankruptcy

18

positions, and the bankruptcy --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the -- but the Code

20

does say, 349, "unless the Court, for cause, orders

21

otherwise."

22

-- what was the likely purpose for that?

Can you tell us how -- how that is -- what

23

MS. SPINELLI:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Because --

Justice Kennedy, what the --- from the very literal

standpoint, it does cover what the Respondents' position

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

is -- is -- is here.

2

is -- does it fall in face of the overall description

3

that you just gave to Justice Ginsburg?

4

Why is it inapplicable and why

MS. SPINELLI:

Justice Kennedy, what the

5

legislative history tells us is that the "for cause"

6

provision in Section 349(b) was intended to protect

7

parties who took actions in reliance on the bankruptcy.

8

And I think it's important to look --

9
10
11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you give me an

example?
MS. SPINELLI:

I can.

So one case that's

12

cited in our briefs is In re Wiese, which is a Seventh

13

Circuit case.

14

15

their claim against the bank that had lent them money in

16

return for the bank's releasing its lien on some cash

17

that they had.

18

couldn't be gotten back.

19

In that case, there was a plan that had

That cash was then disbursed and

The debtors then dismissed their case

20

shortly after the plan was confirmed, and the Seventh

21

Circuit said this was an appropriate case in which to

22

use the "for cause" provision.

23

that occurred in the plan would be undone, but in order

24

to avoid unfairness to the bank, which had taken --

25

which had taken action in reliance on the plan, the

Typically, the release

2

to hold the debtors to their release.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Instead, it was going

Well -- well, if -- if

4

fairness is -- is the -- the -- the basis for the for

5

cause order, the Respondent will say, well, this is

6

fair, because most creditors were paid, so whether

7

you -- you can hear the arguments.

8

MS. SPINELLI:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -I mean, we just talk about

10

fairness.

11

careful answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg a -- about

12

the prior scheme.

13

That's -- that's -- that's different from the

MS. SPINELLI:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

14

Section 349(b) doesn't create that kind of gaping hole

15

in the scheme I just described.

16

understand what it actually does.

17

relatively limited provision.

18

It's important to
I think it's a

So Section 349 says that -- that the default

19

when a bankruptcy case is dismissed is that certain

20

transactions that occurred during the case, such as

21

avoidance actions, get unwound, liens that have been

22

voided are reinstated, and property remaining in the

23

estate is returned to its prebankruptcy owner.

24

words, the bankruptcy is undone as far as possible.

25

In other

The cause exception is an exception to that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

So what the cause exception permits a bankruptcy court

2

to do is to maintain the status quo at the time of

3

dismissal when there is good reason to do so.

4

typical good reason would be reliance by a party on

5

something that happened during the bankruptcy case.

6

Section --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MS. SPINELLI:

9

And the

But

Go ahead.

But Section 349(b) doesn't

then permit the court to go beyond that and do something

10

that's not contemplated in conjunction with a dismissal

11

at all, but doesn't involve maintaining the status quo,

12

but involves actually distributing assets to creditors

13

in violation of the priority scheme.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you said that

15

that reading was supported in the legislative history,

if I understood you correctly.

nature of that legislative history?

18

MS. SPINELLI:

What -- what is the

19

essentially -- there's not a lot of it, but what it

20

essentially says is the bankruptcy courts should use

21

that provision, the cause provision --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

is that?

24

What?

25

I mean, I -- where

In -- in the -- in the -- a Senate Report?

MS. SPINELLI:

I apologize, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

believe -- we -- we cited it in our brief.

2

believe it is in the House -- the 1977 House Report.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

just quickly:

6

would like us to issue?

7
8

Okay.

And I

Thank you.

May I ask, Ms. Spinelli,

What's the scope of the holding that you

I suppose this comes back to Justice Alito's
question of what's actually on the table.

9

MS. SPINELLI:

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.
All settlements?

All

11

structured dismissals?

12

if just this particular kind, how would you characterize

13

it?

14

Just this particular kind?

MS. SPINELLI:

What we think this Court

15

should hold is that settlement proceeds cannot be

16

distributed in violation of priority.

17
18
19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

I mean, a --

So a settlement that is a --

a -- that -- that distributes protest -- proceeds.
MS. SPINELLI:

Correct.

But it -- to be

20

more specific, the -- the order that was entered here,

21

we believe, would -- could never be lawful, regardless

22

of the stage of the case at which it was entered.

23

So we are not saying this order would

24

only -- this order is only unlawful because it was part

25

of a structured dismissal.

We are saying it's unlawful

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

because it took estate assets and distributed them in

2

violation of priority.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

You're saying that -- that

4

there can never be a distribution of estate assets

5

except in compliance with the priorities?

6

MS. SPINELLI:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9
10
11

No.

There is one --

One which -- that's not what

you just said?
MS. SPINELLI:

That -- well, let me -- let

me qualify what I just said, then.
There is one express exception in the

12

code -- that's Section 510 -- provides that claims can

13

be subordinated to other claims under the principles of

14

equitable subordination, which, as this Court said in

15

Noland, are limited to a creditor's bad behavior that

16

harms the estate.

17

There are also some practices that occur in

18

bankruptcy court that -- whose validity I don't think

19

this Court needs to reach.

20

vendor orders are an example.

21

permit, on the first day of a case, a debtor to pay

22

certain vendors on account of their prepetition claims,

23

because doing so is necessary to the debtors maintaining

24

a going concern and reorganizing and coming out the

25

other end a viable business.

For instance, critical
Courts will sometimes

That's based on a doctrine

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

that goes back many, many years before the Bankruptcy

2

Code called the Doctrine of Necessity.

3

reasoning behind that is because a going concern is

4

worth so much more than the debtor's assets liquidated

5

piecemeal.

6

recovery for creditors higher up the priority chain.

7

And the

That creates the possibility of a greater

What happened here is precisely the

8

opposite.

9

This was a naked priority violation for its own sake,

10

and whatever one thinks about critical vendor orders,

11

what happened here, taking value from senior creditors

12

and giving it to junior creditors for its own sake, is

13

not permitted.

There was no possibility of reorganization.

14

May I reserve?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't even have

the extraordinary circumstances exception?
MS. HARRINGTON:

No, we don't -- I mean,

basically, the extraordinary circumstances exception

10

that the Third Circuit wanted to apply would bring in

11

any case that is administratively insolvent, and that's

12

a large proportion of business bankruptcies.

13

That kind of exception also gives parties

14

the -- the wrong incentive to make essentially

15

self-serving assertions about what they would or would

16

not do if the particular disposition that they desire is

17

not approved.

19

that with the statutory provision that was just

20

mentioned, and my guess was you want to qualify that as

21

well with the -- with this emergency creditor, you know,

22

where you're going to sink the -- the person who has a

23

prepetition was just discussed.

24
25

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, the prepetition

distributions that were just discussed, I think that --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

that does present a separate question that we think --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

All right.

3

that's all I wanted to know.

4

here that is going to knock that out.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

All --

You don't want a holding

Right, but -- so I said

6

that a -- a court could not resolve a case by ordering

7

the distribution of assets that would violate their

8

priority scheme.

9

Now, in our view, "the priority scheme" is

10

sort of a broad term that includes both equitable

11

subordination law, subordination principles, which are

12

not applicable here, and also includes the ability of

13

the priority claimholder to consent to impairment of its

14

rights.

15

I think it's important to keep in mind here

16

that the priority claimholders here, Petitioners did not

17

settle.

18

rights were impaired agreed to it, and you can't have --

19

you can't call a settlement basically the agreement of

20

other parties whose rights were not impaired and who, in

21

fact, benefited from the impairment of the Petitioners'

22

rights.

23

This is not a case where the people whose

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would be your principal

24

basis for distinguishing the exception that Ms. Spinelli

25

outlined at the end of her argument from what happened

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

here?

2

I thought your argument was that the

3

priority scheme applies to everything that happens in a

4

Chapter 7 and a Chapter 11.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

So in our view,

6

prepetition distributions in Chapter 11 that violate the

7

priority scheme are not permissible under any

8

circumstances unless there is consent of the impaired

9

priority claimholder.

And so critical vendor orders, if

10

they are done over the objection of the -- of the

11

claimholder who skipped, we think those are not

12

permissible.

13

Now, most of the time those sort of first

14

order distributions happen in a plane of reorganization,

15

not in a plane of -- in a case of reorganization, not a

16

liquidation case.

17

senior claimholders, and they are generally premised on

18

a -- on a prediction that -- that allowing that kind of

19

distribution will ultimately result in every creditor

20

getting more money at the end of the day.

21

those factors apply here.

22

They happen with the consent of the

You didn't have consent.

So none of

This is not an

23

ongoing concern, and there is certainly no finding that

24

everybody is going to get more money at the end of the

day.

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

Ms. Harrington -If --

Yeah, if I could just -- go

ahead.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Please.

There is another logically

7

prior question.

8

you think we should do with the question of whether the

9

bankruptcy court has to approve settlements at all?

And I don't know what you -- what do

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12
13

We think that -There is nothing in the Code

that says that they have to.
MS. HARRINGTON:

So we think that -- that a

14

bankruptcy court does have to approve a settlement that

15

disposes of a claim held by the estate or asserted

16

against the estate.

17

reach that question in this case if it doesn't want to,

18

because we think it's very clear that a -- what a

19

settlement cannot do is provide for the distribution of

20

estate assets.

21

We don't think this Court needs to

I think it's important to remember, State

22

assets don't belong to the debtor, and they don't belong

23

to a subset of creditors.

24

And so the Code provides only specific ways that those

25

assets can be distributed.

They belong to the estate.

In Chapter 11, that's

Alderson Reporting Company

through a plan.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Just to make sure I

3

understand the scope of what you're saying we should

decide:

approved in Iridium itself?

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

Would that also knock out the thing that was

Yes, we think it would.

7

you limit your holding to the resolution of the case,

8

then it would not, because Iridium did not involve the

9

resolution of the case.

10

If

We think the principle applies more broadly

11

to prepetition and distributions as well, when you don't

12

have consent.

13

not to, it doesn't need to reach that question in this

14

case.

15

But if the course -- if the Court prefers

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you don't agree

16

completely with Judge Scirica's dissent?

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

We don't.

I mean, I would

18

point out, again, that he is a -- he is a dissenter in

19

this case, and so he -- even he didn't think that this

20

case would -- would qualify, but we -- we don't think

21

there is anything in the -- in the Code that would allow

22

parties to override the priority claimholders' assertion

23

of their rights.

24
25

Now, it's important to keep in mind that
Chapter 11 is very -- is very flexible.

It allows

basically any type of plan to be confirmed if all the

parties can agree on the terms of a plan.

innovation in Chapter 11 in 1978.

4

the Bankruptcy Act, and I think that sort of clearly

5

expresses Congress' intent that parties, if they can

6

come to an agreement that deviates from sort of the

7

usual course, then they should do it and that that --

8

that agreement should be memorialized in a plan, not in

9

some other disposition.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That was the

It didn't exist in

Can you tell me, just as a

11

matter of practice, of practice and experience, do

12

priority creditors in a settlement, structured

13

settlement agreements, often allow junior creditors

14

to -- to receive something?

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, they often do in

16

plans.

17

a structured dismissal like the kind at issue here,

18

usually those -- the parties turn to that kind of

19

disposition, because they can't obtain the consent of

20

the parties that they would need to get a plan

21

confirmed.

22

agreement that is, in essence, an unconfirmable plan.

23

And instead of trying to get that confirmed, they call

24

it a structured dismissal to override the consent of the

25

priority claimholders.

In -- in our -- in our experience, when there is

And so basically what you have is an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

And so in those cases, no, but -- but -- but

2

I think priority claimholders all the time agree to an

3

impairment of their rights, and, in fact, the priority

claimholders, other than Petitioners who were paid in

dismissal" here.

Do you see a difference between the question

MS. HARRINGTON:

I don't think so.

I think

15

the -- the change in wording was meant to sort of

16

give -- give the particular context that -- that the

question arises in this case.

any difference, it's just a narrower sort of set of what

the law --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I -- I -- it goes

21

to a more fundamental question, which is, is there a

22

difference or in our ruling whether we say no settlement

proceeds can be distributed in violation of the absolute

24

priority rule from a statement that no dismissal,

structured dismissal, can be entered in violation of the

And then, like I said, we think the

If you wanted to limit your holding just to

sort of the resolution of a case in a way that is kind

12

of a substitute for a plan, then I think you could just

13

say a structured dismissal can't authorize the

distribution of estate assets.

15

But I'd like to, again, sort of distinguish

16

the settlement of the claim from the distribution of

estate assets.

18

case, and they are put together throughout Respondents'

19

brief.

20

nothing in the Code that would authorize a debtor or

21

some subset of creditors to distribute estate assets.

22

They don't get -- they don't have any say in how estate

23

assets are distributed.

24

say in that.

25

The two things were put together in this

But they are really separate things.

There's

The Code and Congress have the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, how can you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

a -- a settlement if it can't be carried out?

2

if you -- you're saying one thing is the settlement, and

3

that's okay.

4

the assets, but that's what the settlement provides for.

5

I mean,

And the other thing is the distribution of

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, what the settlement

6

should provide for is basically a liquidation of a

7

claim.

8

a third party, here a creditor, you basically reduce

9

that claim to a dollar amount, and those dollars become

10
11

And so if you have a claim by the estate against

property of the estate.
If you have a settlement of a claim that's

12

asserted by a creditor against the estate, then it's the

13

same kind of thing:

14

you reduce it to a dollar amount, and that becomes the

15

claim against the estate held by the creditor.

16

nothing in the Code would authorize -- and I think it's

17

a -- it would be a violation of the priority system and

18

generally of the system that distributes estate assets

19

to have parties agree on the side of how estate assets

20

should be distributed.

21

property of the debtor once the bankruptcy starts.

22

They're not the property of the creditors.

23

really need to look to the Code provisions to see how

24

estate assets should be distributed.

25

You sort of liquidate the claim,

But

Those estate assets are not the

MS. HARRINGTON:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Go ahead.
What is your response to the

3

argument that your argument regarding Section 103(a)

4

makes the provisions that specifically make the

5

priorities applicable in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11

6

superfluous?

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, it doesn't, because

8

if you look at those provisions, and one of them is

9

Section 1129(a)(9), and then it's Section, I think, 726

10

in Chapter 7, they don't just say Section 507 priority

11

scheme applies.

12

specify the manner in which it applies.

13

They also specify exceptions, and they

And so in Section 1129(a)(9), it says,

14

priority claimholders can agree to an impairment of

15

their rights.

16

Section 7 -- in the -- in the Chapter 7 analog.

17

says -- tells you what it means to pay a priority

18

claimholder either through cash or through deferred cash

19

payments.

20

the parties have a right to demand one or the other.

507 applies.

25

That exception is not included in

provisions?

MS. HARRINGTON:

Exception, but it also sort

2

of tells you what it means to fully -- in -- in the

3

Chapter 11 context, it tells you what it means to pay a

4

priority claimholder.

5

claimholders, I guess, can demand cash on the date of

6

confirmation; others have to agree in some circumstances

7

to deferred cash payments.

9

And so some priority

And so there is definitely

In the Chapter 7 context, it also tells you

10

which type of 507 claims are allowed based on when the

11

associated proof of claim was filed.

12

both cases, they kind of -- they add more substance than

13

the Respondents would have you believe.

14

So those -- in

I'd just like to point out that Congress

15

enacted the priority scheme precisely to prohibit the

16

kind of collusive looking agreements that happened here,

17

where you have high-priority and low-priority creditors

18

kind of squeezing out the middle creditors.

19

Court should not allow parties to make an end run around

20

that prohibition by just scrapping the main settlement

21

or -- or structured dismissal on what is really, in

22

essence, an unconfirmable plan.

23

And the

We think that's what happened here.

The

24

parties -- some of the parties reached an agreement.

25

The agreement couldn't be confirmed as a plan because it

This is the

question that Justice Kagan asked earlier -- the Code

speaks to when the absolute priority rule applies in

it's absolutely critical to make sure that there is no

was -- this is not your asset --

But my problem is quite simple.

7

MR. LANDAU:

9

-- that's -- this is --

this is an asset of the estate?
MR. LANDAU:

11

asset of an estate.

MR. LANDAU:

when you're in Chapter 11, doesn't the judge, the

3

MR. LANDAU:

4

MR. LANDAU:

Not the settlement, per se.
No?

Why not?

Because there's no provision in

the Code -- this is what we explained in our brief --

7

that specific -- it's post-1978.

8

the pre- 1978 world, there was a prevision that required

5

MR. LANDAU:

6

Right.

I think the --

There is no power of the --

7

of the bankruptcy judge to even look at a settlement

8

that the company in bankruptcy has made of an asset;

9

namely, the claim that he has against another party.

10
11

MR. LANDAU:

There is no provision

-- settlements qua settlements.

very clear, Your Honor, because I'm not sure this was as

clear in our brief as it should have been, and I

17

apologize if it wasn't.

18

The fact that there's no provision for

19

approving settlements qua settlements doesn't mean --

20

which there had been under the old regime -- doesn't

21

mean that when you have a settlement that actually

22

disposes of estate assets, like this settlement did,

23

that that disposition of estate assets is not subject to

24

8

MR. LANDAU:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- what we have is a

10

settlement, not corrupt, not crooked, perfectly fine and

11

honest and so forth, but what it does is it takes

12

Congress's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it says, what we'd like to

13

do is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

14

MR. LANDAU:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what that seems to do

is it seems to be quite contrary to the order of -- of

MR. LANDAU:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is -That is -- that is what is

15

bothering me, and presumably the government, and

16

certainly the workers here, who are -- who are upset

17

about it.

18

MR. LANDAU:

Correct.

Well, Your Honor, and

19

I think the -- the -- the clear answer to that is, as a

20

general rule, they can't.

21

exactly why Iridium said there may be some rare

22

exceptions, because once you are in this more

23

discretionary 363(b) land, the -- the priority scheme is

24

going to be the most important.

25

But this case explains

This case is a great example, Your Honor,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

because in this case we have findings that there could

2

be no confirmable Chapter 11 plan because the estate was

3

administratively insolvent.

4

So the Code system that you just described,

5

the waterfall of priorities, would not apply in Chapter

6

11 because there was no way to go to a Chapter 11 plan.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but I'm sure it

8

often happens that there can be no confirmable plan

9

because the creditors -- priority creditors are not

10

going to concede.

11

go through Chapter 7.

So that happens all the time when you

12

MR. LANDAU:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Right.

And that --

And that's not a rare --

so this is not a rare case.

15

MR. LANDAU:

But I'm -- this is only the

16

first prong, Your Honor.

17

well, the alternative, then, is conversion to Chapter 7,

18

and we have findings there, too, that any conversion to

19

a Chapter 7 liquidation, in fact, the estate asset --

20

there would be no settlement there, because at that

21

point, once you've gone through the expense and delay of

22

converting to Chapter 7, it wouldn't make sense to

23

settle.

24

want to -- be willing to settle at the beginning of the

25

case, but --

Then the Court also analyzed,

That's -- there's many reasons that you might

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but this seems --

2

but the essence of the case is not really an objection

3

to approval of the settlement; it's the objection of the

4

distribution of the assets.

5

MR. LANDAU:

Absolutely.

And that's -- I

6

think that's so critical, Your Honor, and -- and their

7

objection would actually completely come back to bite

8

them because there is no legal difference between a

9

distribution of assets on the first day where they

10

recovered $6 million in this case in their prepetition

11

wage and benefit claims.

12

That's why, to go back to Justice Alito's

13

question earlier, it was not a slip of the pen that led

14

them to change their question presented from the

15

question -- from the petition to the merits brief.

16

know perfectly well that a rule that the absolute

17

priority rule applies to every distribution of assets

18

would have creamed the workers in this case and would in

19

future cases, because such workers are often the

20

beneficiaries of these first day orders that pay -- that

21

pay wage and benefit claims, that pay critical vendor

22

orders.

23

They

Once you're talking about a world, as they

24

seem to be suggesting, that all preplan distributions of

fact, the alternative to this settlement was not a

Chapter 11 plan because they would have recovered

nothing in a Chapter 11 plan because there could have

All right.

Now, that would seem to be a

possibility at least from your argument in this case.

6

MR. LANDAU:

Your Honor, I think what you

7

are saying or the -- the point that you're getting to

8

can be resolved through the traditional 363(b) analysis,

9

which allows for play in the joints, unlike their

10

unyielding and absolute -- absolute priority rule.

11

Under you're hypothetical, Your Honor, there

would be money there.

13

that would be an evasion of -- there could be a plan

15

And in that case, it looks like

JUSTICE BREYER:

By the way, if you want me

to, I will make up my hypothetical so that giving half

the gold to this person is just as wonderful as you

would like, and I will also change the hypothetical

matter, if -- if the creditors were to come together and

11

say, you know, we really just don't like this one

creditor, even though that person has a high priority.

13

We're going to structure this so that that person gets

disfavored.

You just have to follow that order.

Here's another Bankruptcy Code:

That's one Bankruptcy Code.

outcomes and nobody gets a worse outcome --

11

MR. LANDAU:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yep.
-- if there is such a

13

solution, you can go with that.

14

completely sensible bankruptcy provision --

15

MR. LANDAU:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

It says

And that might be a

Right.
-- for Congress to have

enacted.

18

MR. LANDAU:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
The question is whether

20

Congress did enact it and what you can point to in the

21

Bankruptcy Code that suggests that the continual

22

statement that it's just one, two, three, four, five is

23

subject to a kind of equitable exception for

24

Pareto-superior outcomes.

25

MR. LANDAU:

Yes.

I can -- I can exactly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

answer that question.

2

the Code is the absolute priority rule with its -- with

3

its specific one, two, three, four, five that apply as a

4

matter of law and is unyielding, applies to plans.

5

you are not in the world of plans, you are in the world

6

of 363(b), which has play in the joints.

7

Pareto optimality that you just said, Your Honor, is

8

something that is appropriate in a 363(b) analysis.

9

The line that Congress drew in

When

And so the

Now, as the Second Circuit pointed out in

10

Iridium and the Third Circuit pointed out here, a

11

critical consideration in that discretionary analysis is

12

to make sure it is not being done for the purpose of

13

evading what would otherwise be something that could

14

proceed to the stage where Congress made the absolute

15

priority rule applicable.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I don't understand

17

how you get to an extraordinary circumstance in that --

18

in this situation.

20

ordinary situation.

21

They're happy to exclude anybody they can --

It seems to me that wanting to

We already know the junior creditors

5

MR. LANDAU:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Absolutely, Your Honor.
The senior creditors

have --

8

MR. LANDAU:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
It happens to be one of

10

the biggest senior creditors here is the one who was

11

insisting upon excluding the junior creditor.

12

MR. LANDAU:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

do we defined "extraordinary"?

15

MR. LANDAU:

Yes.
So where do we go?

How

In that 363(b) world, Your

16

Honor, that governs the use, sale and lease of assets,

17

when a court looks at that, a court can say, is the

18

creditor who is claiming that he or she or it is being

19

unfairly squeezed out, in your hypothetical, can show

20

that there is some mechanism under which that person

21

would otherwise, absent the settlement or the

22

disposition of assets that is -- is contemplated at

23

issue before the Court, would actually make off better.

24
25

The critical problem here is that there were
findings -- there was a hearing in the bankruptcy court

Official - Subject to Final Review

on this.

2

then to the Third Circuit.

3

The findings were -- and these were critical -- that

there could have been no proceeding to a Chapter 11

confirmation.

out in your hypothetical would have actually recovered

something in Chapter 11 --

-- is counterfactual.

principle.

19

about it if that's the way bankruptcy proceedings were

20

supposed to go.

21

this "for cause" language, but this "for cause"

22

language, I mean, this is a pretty specific provision

23

that we're talking about.

Let's just assume

Because that's like a big

I mean -- and I think we would have known

And -- and you suggest while it's in

24

What it says is that when you can't reach a

25

plan and the case has to be dismissed, this is attached

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

to a provision that says everything has to be rolled

2

back.

3

MR. LANDAU:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
And -- and this says, well,

5

not -- you know, maybe, if there is a good reason, not

6

everything has to be --

7

MR. LANDAU:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

Right.
-- rolled back to exactly

the way it was.
But that's a really different kind of

11

provision than saying, in courts, you get to decide

12

or -- or -- or parties, really, you get to decide, and

13

then courts get to -- get to approve an outcome of a

14

bankruptcy proceeding that does not follow the usual

15

priority rules just because these particular parties,

16

not all of them, but these particular parties think it

17

will make some people better off without making other

18

peoples worse off.

19

MR. LANDAU:

Well, the key point is 363(b).

20

That is the general provision that requires bankruptcy

21

courts to review the use, sale, or lease of assets.

22

When you have -- what -- what they are

23

objecting to here in this settlement is the fact not

24

only that it brings money in, but that it actually then

25

distributes money to different people in a way that they

language of the statute, and that's probably -- you

within the question presented here.

Are

we in a world where there is any discretion at all,

versus a world where the absolute priority rule applies

Well, this 363(b) -- is

there -- I mean, this -- you would -- they say -- you're

14

just saying they did it the wrong way when they reached

15

the settlement; then this -- the -- the Petitioners here

should have gone to the bankruptcy judge and said,

settlement.

it.

the -- and so you can resolve this case by simply saying

25

they are wrong to say the absolute priority rule applies

Alderson Reporting Company

If -- if we are

11

concerned about how extraordinary the extraordinary

12

circumstances are -- in other words, your position looks

13

more reasonable the tighter the extraordinariness

14

requirement is -- what -- what type of language would

15

you require -- I mean, you're saying, oh, well, just say

16

you can do this and then it will work out over time how

extraordinary it is.

19

felt an obligation to tighten the extraordinary

20

requirement?

21

MR. LANDAU:

I don't think I could improve

22

on the language that the Second Circuit used in Iridium

23

the -- the most important consideration is conformity

with the absolute priority rule.

saying, is that you're just saying the plans that the

11

Bankruptcy Code declare not confirmable are, in fact,

12

going to be confirmed through this alternative

13

procedure?

14

MR. LANDAU:

No, Your Honor.

Again, the --

15

now we are talking about the means for terminating

16

Chapter 11 plans, which is a little bit different than

17

the question presented, which is all about the

18

distribution of assets.

19

so Section 1112 of the Code says that if a -- if Chapter

20

11 plan can't be confirmed, you have two alternatives.

21

You either go to Chapter 7 conversion or to dismissal.

22

Chapter -- there are specific findings here that Chapter

23

7 conversion made no sense because the -- the

24

trustee would -- the -- the estate did not have the

25

money to pursue the claim on its own and nobody would

But just -- just to be clear,

bring this case on a contingency basis.
Now, the -- the -- the Petitioners here were

3

participating at that hearing in the bankruptcy court

4

where this was done.

5

say, hey, we'd be willing to pursue this on a

6

contingency basis, which is why it's somewhat

7

farfetched, to say the least, that they're now

8

suggesting that theoretically well, they -- they were

9

deprived of this opportunity to pursue this claim

They didn't raise their hands and

10

outside of bankruptcy.

11

to pursue the claim on behalf of the estate in

12

bankruptcy, and nobody wanted to do that.

13

They were given the opportunity

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Landau, is there a

14

difference, in your mind, because there might be in

15

mine, between a settlement that settles an individual

16

claim, the emergency creditor claim that your -- that

17

your opponent spoke about, where there is not a total

18

distribution of the assets of the company, from a plan

19

that's really just an alternative plan, because that's

20

what this structured settlement was?

21
22

In my mind, something that would be an
extraordinary circumstance --

23

MR. LANDAU:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Right.
-- would be something

that did something like the first thing, and not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

necessarily the second.

2

MR. LANDAU:

I think Your Honor is making a

3

very important point, which is, the application of the

4

363(b) discretion may well vary depending on the

5

circumstances of the case and, just -- and your first

6

hypothetical, maybe -- you know that -- that -- that

7

is -- now we are talking about, you know, the way that

8

that 363(b) analysis applies, and it may apply

9

differently --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. LANDAU:

12

-- on the first day of the

bankruptcy versus the last day of the bankruptcy.

13
14

So would you tell --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- me why Sun Life --

Sun Life cared?

15

If it got its settlement -- i.e., it was

16

going to pay $2 million and get all the claims against

17

it released -- what was its reason for not wanting the

18

proceeds to be distributed according to the absolute

19

priority rule?

20

MR. LANDAU:

It wanted a global settlement

21

of all claims and they got that with all other

22

creditors.

23

Petitioners here refused to settle their WARN claims

24

that their -- those are their claims outside the context

25

of this claim get settled, for less than a hundred cents

The -- the -- the creditors -- the

2

essentially, refusing to join the global settlement of

3

everything.

4

So they were -- they were holdouts,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I'm -- I'm sorry.

5

Does this mean that the junior creditors wouldn't have

6

agreed to this settlement because the senior creditors

7

could have?

8

line -- in line care about how much was left over to

9

junior creditors, including Sun Life?

10

What did the senior creditors, who were in

MR. LANDAU:

Well, I think that the point is

11

that Sun would not have entered into the settlement at

12

all unless -- which -- which benefited all the

13

creditors, including the junior creditors --

14

Why does Sun?

Well, for --

Why does Sun Life care?

In the absence of a global

20

settlement of this WARN claim outside of the -- against

21

Sun, Sun didn't want to have a settlement that -- that

22

funded the litigation against it.

23
24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, it --

No, the settlement would

have been the one that occurred.
MR. LANDAU:

No, because it --

There's two different claims.

6

was -- in the context of settling the fraudulent

7

conveyance claim against the estate, Sun only wanted to

have a global settlement to put this whole litigation

behind it.

These particular Petitioners had a

money to pursue it, and --

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't understand.

My basic question was --

4

MR. LANDAU:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.
-- what did Sun Life

6

care if the fraudulent conveyance claim was going to be

7

resolved and released?

8

MR. LANDAU:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because -Why did it care to

10

exclude these truck drivers from receiving whatever they

11

demanded?

12

MR. LANDAU:

Because that would have funded

13

the truck drivers to pursue their separate WARN claims

14

against us.

15
16

So we didn't want them -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

you had already --

17

MR. LANDAU:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

But that eventually --

No.
Sun Life had already won

that.
MR. LANDAU:

No.

We only won later.

21

That -- it's -- it's the timing of that, I think, Your

22

Honor, that really gets to the point.

23

I think the fundamental point here is we're

24

really talking about a rule where they're saying the

25

absolute priority rule in flexibly and invariably

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Our position, on the other hand, is that the

6

7

to look at making sure that it's not an evasion of the

9

There are -- that's a discretionary

And as the Second Circuit said in Iridium and

But -- but -- but the question that this

10

Court was asked to resolve is, is it the -- the rigid

11

12

13

think in this case that the --

14

That's what

17

MR. LANDAU:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but -It says nothing about what

19

the terms are.

It says nothing about what the

20

settlement is.

And the question for us, I guess, is, in

21

those words, which make no reference to it --

22

MR. LANDAU:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

terms that will, in fact, take these assets that belong

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MS. SPINELLI:

Respondents' position fails

4

because Section 363(b) is not a means of distributing

5

estate assets.

6

Mr. Landau referred to is discretion to approve a

7

settlement or a sale of an estate asset, not to

8

distribute the settlement or sale proceeds in violation

9

of priority.

10

The -- the 363(b) discretion that

Assets are distributed under Chapter 11

11

through a Chapter 11 plan.

12

fundamental point here is that those assets cannot be

13

distributed on account of prepetition claims in

14

violation of priority.

15

That's it.

And our

To the extent there is a potential exception

16

for the Doctrine of Necessity, that's hotly disputed.

17

Courts disagree about whether that exception exists.

18

And that's not an issue this Court needs to resolve

If debtors could
