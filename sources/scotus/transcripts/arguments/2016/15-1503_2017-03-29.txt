ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. WILLIAMS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 15-1503

10
11

MR. WILLIAMS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established

13

the now familiar principle that the prosecution must

14

disclose to the defense all favorable and material

15

information.

16

that principle.

17

information that a serial assaulter of women had been

18

seen acting suspiciously at the crime scene before

19

police arrived.

20

this man's girlfriend was in the alley at the time, yet

21

he did not speak to her and she did not speak to him.

22

If this information had been available to Petitioners at

23

trial, they would have presented an alternative

24

perpetrator's theory that centered on this incredibly

25

violent individual.

This case involves a clear violation of

They would have told the jury that during

October 1984, in this neighborhood, this man committed

similar assaults against similar victims.

have then posited to the jury that the same person who

had accosted a D.C. councilwoman in an alley and

Yes.
At the trial, the

10

witness, Mr. Freeman, indicated that there were two

11

people acting suspiciously.

12

those names had not been disclosed.

13

explained his reasons for not disclosing the names, and

14

defense counsel chose to say, I'll get them on the --

15

I'll call the witness and get the names myself, and then

16

he dropped the ball.

17

He raised an objection that

What also occurred was that these -- this --

18

this name was given to him as a -- was given to him and

19

all defense counsel as a possibility within the

20

materials that were disclosed, that Mr. McMillan had

21

been on the scene and no follow-up was done.

22
23
24
25

How can we say that it was undisclosed or
not made available in light of those record facts?
MR. WILLIAMS:

Sure.

So let me begin with

what the prosecutor said during that colloquy, which is

at page 63 of the Joint Appendix.

2

that his view was that this was not Brady, so he made

3

the -- the statement that this was not Brady information

4

and that he had adhered to his Brady obligations.

5

The prosecutor said

This Court made clear in Banks v. Dretke

6

that a rule that the prosecutor may hide and the defense

7

must seek is untenable under Brady.

8

what happened here.

9

prosecutor went further and he made statements that

That's essentially

In so doing, Justice Sotomayor, the

10

perhaps not deliberately, in fact, still did mislead the

11

defense counsel about the probative value of this

12

information, because he said first that Mr. McMillan had

13

no association with the garage.

14

the all -- and the information suggests that it wasn't.

15

And then further, he said that Mr. McMillan

That's not true.

And

16

was only at the scene approximately 90 minutes after the

17

crime occurred.

18

only entity in that colloquy that was aware of

19

information that this crime may have happened only 30

20

minutes after the crime occurred.

21

evidence, Your Honor, is that really, the alternative

22

perpetrator theory depends on five pieces of suppressed

23

information.

Court to describe the statement.

way, includes Mr. McMillan.

Nobody else, no witness,

alone, that he was there without any members of this

instead of the alternate perpetrator.

Michelle Roberts, who was a leading criminal defense

13

lawyer in the city at the time and was until very

14

recently, she also had one of the weakest cases against

her client, a case so weak that the government now says

16

it is perfectly logical that he was acquitted.

17

testified in our postconviction hearing that if she had

18

been aware of the McMillan information, she would have

19

pursued an alternative perpetrator defense.

20

But let me further add, I think they all would
And the best evidence for that is that

And she

So we think the evidence in this case

21

suggests that all of the Petitioners would have

22

developed this theory and run with it.

23

And if I may add, I think one of the reasons

24

why they would have done that is that it's not that much

25

of a difference from the not-me-maybe-them defense.

Surely, in any criminal case, when you have an eye -- a

purported eyewitness who does not identify your client,

3

in closing, any defense counsel will identify that to

4

the jury.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, but I -- I --

6

my greatest difficulty with Mr. McMillan is that clearly

7

his '92 crime, which was decades after this crime,

8

suggests a similarity that would have been very potent

9

at a trial.

But the disclosure of this Brady, of

10

Mr. McMillan, wouldn't have led to the introduction of

11

that later-committed crime.

12

an alternative theory is robberies of two women, neither

13

of which were in any way identical to this crime.

14

of the defendants had crimes of violence and robberies,

15

so their criminal activity was just as bad, if not worse

16

in some cases, than Mr. McMillan, why would he have been

7

9

We would not

But let me go back to the foundation of your

10

question, Justice Sotomayor, which is, what

11

differentiates McMillan from other people in this

12

neighborhood and from the -- and from the defendants.

13

McMillan's two other assaults of women were incredibly

14

violent.

15

councilwoman which took place in an alley, was so

16

violent and so ferocious that the victim yelled murder,

17

and that -- and that was why people came to her aid.

18

She naturally thought -- and she told this to The

19

Washington Post -- she naturally thought that this

20

person wasn't just trying to take her purse, that he was

21

trying to kill her, and that would have been powerful

22

evidence that Petitioners could have used at trial.

23

They could have put this D.C. councilwoman on the stand

24

and had her testify to her opinion about what was

25

happening to her.

Specifically his assault of a D.C.

Her lay opinion.

Alderson Reporting Company

That would have

been powerful evidence.
I'd note, just in regards to the

3

Petitioners' criminal histories, Your Honor, the

4

government never suggested that those criminal histories

5

were admissible at trial.

6

those crimes bore any resemblance to this crime.

remember, the government's theory was that this was a

theory does seem completely inconsistent with the

defenses that were put on at trial.

16

how you can say that they could have used both.

17

And

I -- I'm not sure

But in order to convince the jury to accept

18

the alternative perpetrator theory, wouldn't it have

19

been necessary to convince the jury that Alston and Bard

20

pled guilty and were sentenced to substantial prison

21

sentences for crimes that they didn't participate in at

22

all, and that all of the other witnesses who described

23

this group attack, including at least one who doesn't

24

seem to have the -- the 14-year-old boy, who doesn't

That -- that's a pretty

MR. WILLIAMS:

We think that there is

4

definitely a reasonable probability that the jury would

have had reasonable doubt, and that's the -- that's the

6

standard, whether or not this jury would have had

7

reasonable doubt and whether or not there was a

8

reasonable probability that it would have had it, even

9

in light of these purported eyewitnesses.

10

Now, we started with Alston and Bennett, and

11

I'd like to talk about Thomas.

12

I may, to the beginning of your question, Justice Alito,

13

because I think it speaks to the lack of incongruity

14

between these two defenses.

promise I will get to that.

16

Now, I'd like to go, if

I'll -- I'll get to that; I

Let's start with Alston and Bennett.

The

best reason that a jury would have to disbelieve Calvin

Alston is that Calvin Alston himself denied

letters to a judge, to a -- to a D.C. commissioner that

21

he had not been involved in this crime and that his

JUSTICE ALITO:

But even so, wouldn't it

still be difficult to explain how Thomas came up with a

theory that would be a complete fabrication.

It's not

mistaken about things, or he might have exaggerated or

with no obvious motive.

It would be a complete fabrication

9

No.

If I may, Justice Alito, I'd like to go back

10

to the very beginning of your question, because I would

11

like to explain how we don't think there is that much

12

difference between what -- a lot of what the defense

13

counsel tried to do, and also using the

14

alternative-perpetrator theory.

15

The one thing that defense counsel did in

16

their original trial -- which was devastating, by the

17

way -- but that they would not have done in the -- in --

18

if they had access to the suppressed information, is

19

they would not have actively bolstered the prosecution's

20

witnesses.

21

They did that over and over again.
And the lead prosecutor took advantage of

22

that in his rebuttal closing.

23

this is at Joint Appendix page 185 -- something to the

24

effect of:

Well, look at what these defense counsel

25

told you.

They told you the believable witnesses are

He said -- and I believe

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

the ones who say that my client wasn't there, and the

2

unbelievable ones are the ones who said that my client

3

was there.

4

That's not a defense.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why wouldn't that have

6

happened anyway?

7

alternative-perpetrator theory, there's still a lot of

8

defendants with a lot of lawyers with -- seems still a

9

strong incentive to point at the other folks and say it

10

I mean, even if you had this

was them, it wasn't me.

11

MR. WILLIAMS:

Justice Kagan, it would not

12

have been a motive to go so far as to bolster the other

13

witnesses.

14

on McMillan would be powerful evidence to say:

15

this is the story that we think you should consider

16

about what happened.

17

doubt to you, the jury.

18

alternative account of this crime that differs from what

19

the prosecution is telling you.

20

The alternative-perpetrator theory centered
Look,

This is the driver of reasonable
Here's an entirely different

And they would use that to show, look, not

21

only is this a reason to disbelieve all of the

22

prosecution's witnesses, but this is also a reason to

23

disbelieve the specific witnesses that have identified

24

my client.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, lawyers are used to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

arguing in the alternative, but other people are not.

2

And I -- it's really hard to see how the -- the defense

3

argument could be:

4

by McMillan and another, and a confederate of his; but

5

if you don't believe that, it was committed by the

6

group, but I wasn't part of the group.

7
8
9

This was -- this crime was committed

That's really hard to -- to do that; isn't
it?
MR. WILLIAMS:

Right.

And if I gave the

10

impression that that's what they would be arguing, I --

11

I apologize, because that's not the argument that I

12

think would be done here.

13

The argument would be McMillan is the most

14

likely alternative perpetrator.

15

you should have doubt about this prosecution's case.

16

These witnesses are flawed.

17

motivations to give testimony.

18

doubt them, and McMillan is the obvious reason why they

19

are all lying.

He is the reason that

But it is still the government's burden to

21

prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

22

at this government's case, if the government can only

23

point you to -- for example, the government can only

24

point you to Carrie Eleby, Harry Bennett, and Calvin

Mr. McMillan's presence in the alley, Mr. McMillan's

So that's the way we think that they would
all work together.

7

I would also add that the Court should

consider "without evidence" cumulatively.

We not only have the

10

statements from Luchie and Watts that indicate that the

13

undermines the investigation.

14

further diminished the credibility of the prosecution

15

and the detectives.

16

further reason to believe that these witnesses were

17

flawed and they were the result of a flawed

investigation.

The other reason he might have returned is

17

information about himself inside that garage, and he

19

would have wanted to remove it.

In this incredibly close case the government

not only wrongfully suppressed evidence of two

a defendant, Alphonso Harris, who the two corroborators

without the suppressed evidence.

Indeed even the lead

10

jury simply was not willing to convict based on all

11

Alston and Bennett alone.

12

And that leaves Carrie Eleby as the only

13

additional witness who claimed to have seen Overton

14

participate in the attack as the center of the

15

government's case against Overton.

16

wrongfully withheld evidence that Carrie Eleby had

17

persuaded another witness to lie to investigators to

18

implicate someone in the crime by falsely claiming to

19

have heard him confess.

20

And the government

That suppressed impeachment evidence is

21

distinct from any impeachment to which Eleby was subject

22

at trial because of what it indicates about her motives.

23

Lying to protect someone is understandable.

24

to implicate someone in a horrific crime is malicious.

25

And Eleby's willingness to encourage someone else to lie

Alderson Reporting Company

But lying

strongly suggests she would have been willing to lie to

start first with what actually happened in the

deliberations because you can't understand what's going

2

on with Turner, Chris Turner and Overton, unless you

3

understand that the jury deliberated carefully,

4

convicted six defendants and acquitted two defendants

5

after going through an elaborate process of considering

6

the evidence in a six-week trial, sending out a variety

7

of notes that all required consideration of evidence and

8

culminating in a request to see Yarborough's videotaped

9

statement, which he gave early on in the investigation

10

in which he describes the group attack as a pincer

11

movement with two groups of people moving out of the

12

park, surrounding the alley, 8th Street and 9th Street,

and commencing the attack.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, of course

2

that's right because that was the only theory in the

3

case.

4

the prosecutors had given over this evidence such that

5

an alternative theory of the case could have been

6

proposed?

And the question is, what would have happened if

7

I mean, one of the things that you get when

8

you read these briefs and when you read the transcripts

9

is, this was kind of guaranteed to be bad for the

10

defendants in the sense that, without any alternative

11

theory, it was -- it was a circular firing squad, and it

12

was, you know, you should believe the guy who doesn't

13

incriminate me, but of course you should believe him as

14

to everybody else.

15

this, it created the worst of all possible worlds for

16

the defendants.

17

as compared to that, of course we would have run with

18

this alternative theory and it would have been an -- a

19

completely different trial.

20

And all ten of these people saying

And I think what they are saying now is

MR. DREEBEN:

So, Justice Kagan, it's not

21

actually accurate that they had no alternative theory.

22

Rouse, who was the -- the defendant who committed the

23

culminating act and has four separate people testifying

24

that he did it, ran the most obvious alternative

perpetrator defense, the one that was readily available

classic defense strategy is to say, they've admitted

their guilt.

7

Gerald Merkerson did this on their own.

Alston and Bennett are

Now they're trying to spread the blame in

So they had the most obvious

13

What they're now talking about is one that

14

would require the jury to disbelieve Melvin Montgomery

15

about the way that the attack originated in the park;

16

Maurice Thomas, a 14-year-old which they admit today had

17

no reason to lie about what he saw.

18

counsel described him as walking by, looking in the

19

alley and seeing the beginning of a murder in progress.

There was a group standing behind it in the

4

of the reasons why I think, to return to Justice

5

6

Chris Turner is not making any individualized argument

here at all.

that I wouldn't have been convicted because Maurice

But what Maurice Thomas is describing as a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but if you had --

2

you had been asked you would have told the prosecutor at

3

the time that this is not Brady material, so far as,

4

McMillan is concerned?

5

would have given the prosecutor, don't turn it over.

6

That's -- that's the advice you

MR. DREEBEN:

Well -- I -- Justice Kennedy,

7

I don't know that is the advice that I would have given

8

him because, unless the government has a good

9

countervailing reason, which it often does, such as

10

witness safety or concerns about obstruction of justice,

11

providing that information to a defendant about the

12

crime scene, about the general timeframe, in which it

13

occurred, would be good practice and it's the practice

14

today.

15

The question for this Court is whether there

16

is a reasonable probability that the jury would have

17

reached a different verdict if it had had turned over

18

the McMillan evidence and the defendants had presented

19

that McMillan evidence to the court.

20

legal question that occurs both ex ante and ex post.

21

ante is harder for the government to know what the

22

defense will do with information and that's why a

23

generous policy of discovery is good for the finality of

24

criminal convictions as well as the fairness of the

25

process.

That is the same

tacking too close to the wind.

3

in close cases that is the better advice.

4

Department of Justice's advice today, but at the time,

5

the prosecutor looking at the tenuous connection of

6

McMillan to the crime, the only evidence that we had

7

were some statements from witnesses which were not

8

enough to prosecute that McMillan was actually involved

9

in the group attack.

It specifically said, prosecutor anxious about

14

to the judge.

15

that and asked for a ruling on it.

16

the Brady question because the Brady obligation is the

17

prosecutors, it's not the responsibility of the judge.

18

And that was what he said

Michelle Roberts could have challenged
It wouldn't resolve

But the fact that the defendants didn't

19

press forward on that shows that they had very little

20

interest, I think, in trying to identify a mystery man

21

as the person who had committed this crime alone rather

22

than taking the government's evidence as it seemed to

23

be, which was a strong case of a group attack, and the

24

question was:

25

Which defendants were inculpated in it?

is Petition Appendix, pages 49A to 45A.

legal error, Your Honor, if you look at Parker v.

principle errors in the decision below.

If I may, I'd

First, in answer to your question Justice

23

Kagan, there was a civilian witness, it was William

24

Freeman, and he was standing at the corner of eighth and

that this group attack had occurred.

in the record from the only civilian witness the only

5

person who did not have reason to fabricate testimony,

as a young inarticulate witness, who was -- who was

7

being pressured by police to inculcate himself or his

friends.

days the jury asks to look at that information, shows

24

that the prosecution's theory here that there was clear

evidence of guilt against some people isn't true because

I would remind the Court

And the fact, that after deliberating for seven

before they return any verdict.

And last thing they do

Last, overall, the one thing you did not
