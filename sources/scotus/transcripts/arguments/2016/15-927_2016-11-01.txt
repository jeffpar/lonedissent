ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN J. BLACK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BLACK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In Petrella, the Court reaffirmed the

12

principle that when Congress enacts a limitations

13

period, that courts may not apply the doctrine of laches

14

to shorten the statutory period.

15

In patent law, Congress prescribed a

16

six-year lookback period from the date of suit and a

17

20-year patent term.

18

the statutory scheme would frustrate the will of

19

Congress, and create uncertainty about something as

20

fundamental as the timeliness of suit.

21

Injecting judicial discretion into

There is nothing in the Patent Act which

22

compels the creation of a unique patent law rule, and if

23

the Court were to create an exception here, that would

24

invite litigation in the lower courts over a wide range

25

of Federal statutes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't dispute

that equitable estoppel applies across the board?
MR. BLACK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

Equitable estoppel applied has been part of the law, on

5

the law side of the Court, since the mid-18th century,

6

as the Court held in -- in Dickerson in 1879.

7

originally actually called "estoppel in pays," and it

8

became known as equitable estoppel, but it's been a

9

legal principle for over -- well over a hundred years,

10
11

It was

and it applies to all actions at law and in equity.
JUSTICE BREYER:

For this -- for this

12

argument I'm not sure, because of course they dispute

13

that, and they have a long list of cases, Alsterbach --

14

or what, Aukerman and so forth, going back into history.

15

And they have the man who wrote the statute, and they

16

have words in the statute.

17

through all of those cases, what we will find is that

18

there is a long history of applying laches in one legal

19

context, or that it's -- that it's patents.

20

almost all patent cases were equitable cases, and so it

21

would be a big change, and you know all those arguments.

22

And they say if we look

And anyway,

Now you've come back and you have two

23

arguments -- two cases the other way, and you say two

24

are mistaken.

25

that one is read the cases.

So it seems to me what I have to do on
And if I come to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5

conclusion that there is this long history here, then

2

the laches should stay.

3

that no, if you really look at these cases, there isn't

4

that history, then it should go.

5

case, one way or the other, of us making up anything.

6

It's a question of what was the heart of the law for

7

quite a long time before.

And if I come to the conclusion

8

MR. BLACK:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But neither is it a

Your Honor, let me address -Is that right?

I mean,

10

that's how I'm approaching it, and I'm asking you to

11

comment on that because I don't want to waste a lot of

12

time reading cases I don't have to read.

13

MR. BLACK:

No, Your Honor.

14

to read the cases.

15

The statute is what controls.

16

What you should read is the statute.

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

"enforcement."

18

the word --

You don't have

In the statute is the word

And -- and when it is invalid, what's

19

MR. BLACK:

"Unenforceability."

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- "unenforceable."

And

21

that could apply just to the -- the -- you know,

22

monkeying around with the patent, doing bad things to

23

the patent, or it could include laches.

24

writes it says, yeah, it includes laches.

25

read it the other way not to.

And the guy who
And you could

So I didn't get too far

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with the statute, either.

2

MR. BLACK:

Your Honor, let's discuss

3

unenforceability.

4

the case is that the Federal Circuit did not actually

5

take up the position that the word "unenforceability"

6

meant laches.

7

is for those of us who practice in this area every day,

8

we just don't think of laches as an unenforceability

9

doctrine.

10

One of the interesting facts about

And I think part of the reason for that

Unenforceability brings to mind rendering

11

the patent unenforceable, may not be enforced.

12

certainly applies when there has been egregious conduct,

13

like patent misuse or a fraud on the patent office.

14

it does not apply to laches.

15

enforced in this case and any others, seeking damages

16

from the date of suit through the date of trial.

17

And that

But

The patent can still be

We did not have a dictionary definition here

18

of "unenforceability," from 1952 or any other time.

19

Respondent's position is that it was known, but they

20

don't actually have any support in a dictionary

21

definition, in the case law, or in the legislative

22

history.

23

And the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They have some cases

24

from us in other courts relating unenforceability to

25

patents.

We even called one patent unenforceable

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because of laches.

So -- I mean, I agree with Justice

2

Breyer that the case law on both sides is fairly sparse.

3

I don't know what judgments to draw from that.

4

there are some cases that use the word "unenforceable"

5

in that sense.

6

MR. BLACK:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

But

I believe -And that's what --

that's what Federico -- Federico did, right?

9

MR. BLACK:

Well, Mr. Federico --

10

Mr. Federico's -- I believe there's only one case that

11

actually used "unenforceability" or "unenforceable" with

12

laches.

Occasionally, the word "enforce" is used.

13
14

But let me address Mr. Federico's
commentary --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. BLACK:

17

Their timing.

I take that -- I take that

point.

18

Let me address Mr. Federico's commentary.

19

All he said was that laches was included.

20

it was an unenforceability.

21

that position up.

22

He didn't say

Federal Circuit didn't take

And he certainly didn't say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, just to stop

23

you there.

I'm just reading what the -- this is in the

24

red brief, so you can correct it if it's wrong, but he

25

said the commentary, his commentary explained that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

quote, "unenforceability," end quote, was, quote, "added

2

by amendment in the Senate for greater clarity, and that

3

as amended, the defenses would include equitable

4

defenses such as laches."

5
6

Now there are words in between the quoted
passages, so are you going to tell me those are --

7

MR. BLACK:

There -- there are words in

8

between.

We have to interpret sort of the semicolons in

9

Mr. Federico's post-1952 commentary to reach the result.

10

He believed that laches was included in the

11

statute, but he never said -- and no court has ever said

12

-- that the form of laches which is being asserted here,

13

which would be unique in all of Federal law, was

14

applicable.

15

which applies the remedial provision for injunction.

16

And we have Section 284, which provides the damage

17

remedy.

18

We have Section 283 of the Patent Act,

Section 283 says that injunctions may be

19

issued according to the principles of equity.

That

20

certainly includes laches, and that's our position, and

21

that's consistent with the court below.

22

Section 284 is the damage remedy.

23

is no -- there is no power granted to courts to overrule

24

the clear language in Section 286, which is the time

25

limitation on damages in the Patent Act.

Alderson Reporting Company

And there

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the clear

language argument really doesn't help you at all.

rule that Congress selected for patent infringement

13

cases in 1896.

14

To create a statute of limitations.

15

called it in 1896, to supplant this Court's ruling in

16

Campbell v. Haverhill, where the Court was put to the

17

Hobson's choice of saying that the law -- the patent

18

law, was that there either was no limitations period or

we apply State law.

20

That is the timeliness

It was enacted for a very clear purpose:
That's what they

The result was that the Court had to rule

Congress was to abolish State-by-State limitations

24

find that it's now judge by judge under the doctrine of

laches.

that issue exhaustively in Petrella and could not find

4

Respondents one single example --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

that.

I lost.

nonetheless.

The Court looked at

I have one question on

I dissented in Petrella, and I thought to myself,
Okay?

9

I lost that case.

How right I was, but

So I don't want, I think in this case, just

10

to repeat, I'm still dissenting, so I'll take Petrella

11

as the law, at least I'm tentatively doing that.

12

then I looked here to say, well, is there a significant

13

difference?

14

And I found so far you've mentioned them.
Maybe case law and history, but I have to

15

look that one up.

16

sides to that too.

17

And

Maybe language, but there are two

Then I found this.

That in Petrella, to me

18

in dissent a major point, which was well-answered by the

19

majority, is what's going to happen after about 30 years

20

where the plaintiff has just laid in wait to see if the

21

material is a success, after they spend all the money

22

it's a success, and he sues for the last six years and

23

collects all the profit while the defendant was the one

24

who paid all the money that earned the profit.

25

Never fear, said the majority, because you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

can deduct all that expense from the six years' profit

2

that you're suing for.

3

overcome that argument very well.

Never fear.

And I didn't really

4

But in this case, it isn't true that you can

5

deduct, and therefore plaintiffs can lie in wait to see,

6

and it is 40 times more difficult for a company that has

7

relied on their not suing to change the hundreds of

8

billions of dollars in investment, and in case we think

9

that's theoretical, Dell has filed a brief involving

10

Sprint, Lucent and other companies where they spent

11

close to billions knowing there was somebody out there

12

who might sue, but he wasn't going to.

13

believe he wasn't, approximately.

14

they come back and they try to get all this money, just

15

the profit, without the deduction of the loss when it's

16

too late for the company to change.

17
18

mind, is a big difference.
MR. BLACK:

Understood, Your Honor.

First of all --

22

And then later on

Now, I'll look into that, but that, in my

He led them to

May -- may I just

clarify?
Petrella explained, in the context of that
case, that it wasn't unscrupulous for this woman to wait

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

to see whether there was anything in it for her.

2

should she spend her money on a lawsuit when there

3

wasn't anything in the bank?

4

Why

So the -- the point was that it wasn't

5

unscrupulous to wait to see whether the suit was worth

6

the expense of suing.

That was --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. BLACK:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I accept that.

That's my answer, Your Honor.
No.

No, that isn't.

If it

10

isn't -- look.

11

unscrupulous, laches doesn't apply.

12

unjust or inequitable about it, laches doesn't apply.

13

If it isn't unscrupulous -- if it isn't
If there is nothing

I am not getting into an argument about who

14

did or didn't behave unscrupulously.

15

there was unscrupulous behavior that would ordinarily

16

call into play laches.

I am assuming that

I am assuming that.

For example, after telling him, don't worry,

18

I won't sue, he phoned him up every day to see if the

19

evidence has been burned up.

20
21

MR. BLACK:

That would be estoppel, Your

And that -- that would be estoppel.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to --

23

MR. BLACK:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I think that whether there is unscrupulous

For all -No, you -- please.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

behavior or bad or unfair behavior is a function of

2

whether an existing doctrine, laches, applies to the

3

case.

4

And that I think is the issue here.
So I have to assume laches applies to the

5

case, if laches applies at all, and that's what we are

6

arguing about.

I want to hear what you

were going to say.
MR. BLACK:

Lying in wait -- the lying --

it's the lying-in-wait question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

There are a couple --

No, it's not.

It's the

17

difference -- the difference that when, in fact, in an

18

appropriate case, you do sue under copyright, what you

19

get is the profit from the last six years, minus the

20

costs to produce that profit.

21

When you do sue in patent, and the examples

22

are in the Dell brief, you get the profit for the last

23

six years without subtracting the money that previously

24

went in to produce that profit, and moreover, companies

25

spend hundreds of millions of dollars in reliance on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

whatever conduct gave rise to laches.

2

differences.
Okay.

That's the

3

MR. BLACK:

Three points, at least.

4

First, there is a significant difference

5

between laches, which requires only delay and is a

6

timeliness rule, delay and prejudice, it's a timeliness

7

rule, and it conflicts with the timeliness rule in 286.

8
9

For egregious conduct we still have
estoppel.

Estoppel requires misleading conduct that

10

leads the infringer to believe that they will not be

11

disturbed.

12

being addressed here.

13

which is delay, and it is a timeliness rule that was

14

developed in the equity courts and was used occasionally

15

in the law courts when there was no statute of

16

limitations.

17

That still applies.

Estoppel is -- is not

We are only talking about laches,

But as -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wait, wait.

18

this is still an issue in this case.

19

whether estoppel would apply.

This is --

There is an issue

20

MR. BLACK:

Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor.

21

What happened -- what happened below is

22

summary judgment was granted on estoppel and laches.

23

Went up to the court of appeals, they reversed on

24

estoppel finding there was a genuine issue of material

25

fact on whether or not the defendant actually relied on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

any -- on any conduct of the plaintiff, and sent it back

2

down.

3

But with respect to the laches, the court

4

said, well, we have these presumptions that apply, and

5

therefore, there is no -- there is nothing to try.

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
unenforceable -- unenforceable?

8

MR. BLACK:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

So is estoppel an

Estoppel -- it's -Render the patent

unenforceable?

11

MR. BLACK:

It's -- it's unclear.

There are

12

certainly some cases that tie the two together, but it

13

probably just --

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Just like here with

laches.
MR. BLACK:

Laches, no.

There -- there

17

are -- there are some cases on estoppel, but I think the

18

estoppel doctrine really emanates from the same place it

19

emanates in copyright law, which is, it's a general

20

defense, generally applicable in actions in law.

21

collateral estoppel.

22

Everything doesn't have to be in 282.

23
24
25

Like a coordinate satisfaction.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You've got two more

points that you wanted to raise.
MR. BLACK:

Like

Yes, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

Lying in wait.

We have to understand what

2

the practicalities are at the district court level.

3

those of us that live in the trenches, here's what

4

really happens.

For

5

So you have Section 287 of the Patent Act,

6

which the Respondents really don't want to talk about.

7

Congress considered this lying-in-wait problem, the

8

problem of a defendant who doesn't know about the

9

infringement, and it did three things.

10

First of all, it made patent filings public,

11

and they're searchable on the Internet, and there are

12

patent attorneys on the other side of this who are fully

13

capable of looking these things up.

14

Second, they enacted Section 287, which is

15

specific limitation on damages.

16

damages in a patent case unless you comply with

17

Section 287.

18

the patent -- to the -- to the defender, to the

19

defendant, or you have to mark your product with the

20

patent number.

21

the way Congress dealt with this problem of the

22

infringer who wouldn't know about a patent.

23

You cannot claim back

287 says, you must give actual notice to

There are some extensions, but that was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But most of the

24

things we are worried about, we are not worried about

25

the lever or something, it's chips and things like that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

and you can't mark those.

2

MR. BLACK:

That's right.

So what that

3

means is the plaintiff can't mark; the plaintiff

4

therefore, in most cases, has to give actual notice to

5

the infringer.

6

Now, once that happens, the infringer is a

7

tortfeasor, and they are on notice.

8

couple of choices.

9

So they have a

They can go to the patent office, under the

10

old rules and new rules, to try to defeat the patent.

11

They can file a declaratory judgment action.

12

change their behavior, or, they can do what happened

13

here, on full notice, they decided to plow ahead, to

14

collect a lot of profits over years, and at the end of

15

the day they might have to pay what the statute

16

requires:

17

They can

A reasonable royalty.
There is nothing unreasonable about that.

18

Unlike copyright law where the infringer can be stripped

19

of its profits, the remedy is a reasonable royalty in

20

patent cases.

21

So going back to the statute, which really

22

has the control here, Section 286 is the timeliness rule

23

that Congress provided.

24

delineation of the remedies.

25

is damages.

They had a very clear
283 is injunctions.

Then they had the time limitation on

damages, which they called the statute of limitations.

That's how they set the statute up.

damages, you must comply with Section 287.

5

And they put a

This is an integrated whole.

And you also

6

have a 20-year patent life from the date of filing of

7

the application now, which means usually 17 years.

8

Takes a couple of years to get through the patent

9

office, unlike copyright law where the copyright could

10

go on for 70 years and with a three-year rolling window.

11

Patent law is limited.

most of the time, patents are not as valuable in the

It takes time for technology to

Once it does, the patentholder has a choice.

Patentholder, if he sees a small -- he or she sees a

17

small infringer who is not a threat, just like in

Petrella, they can decide, you know, I don't want to go

19

to the expense of Federal litigation.

20

spend ten years and millions of dollars on litigation.

21

But if down the road that little threat, which was not

22

much of a threat, turns into an existential threat, the

23

patentholder can sue.

25

I don't want to

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18
19

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly recognized that

20

the 1952 Patent Act sought to retain and reflect patent

21

law as it then existed.

22

defenses applicable in any patent action, it did so

23

against the backdrop of a decades-long consensus that

24

laches is an available defense.

25

When Section 282 codified

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26

codification?

2

it?

I don't see anything in that -- what is

2 -- 282? -- other than the word "enforceable."

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

And that -- well, the

4

lower court -- the Federal circuit didn't specify

5

whether it was codified under the words "unenforceable"

6

or "absence of liability."

7

brief, this Court repeatedly and other courts have

8

recognized, as did PJ Federico, that laches is an

9

unenforceability defense, and that in enacting those

10

defenses --

11
12

But as we point out in our

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, how could it be

when it doesn't make the patent unenforceable?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- it does in exactly the

14

same way, for example, Justice Ginsburg, that estoppel

15

does; that is it is a defendant-specific defense, just

16

as estoppel, which all concede is an unenforceability

defense.

bar you from ever enforcing the patent, like patent

23

misuse or misrepresentation to the patent office.

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

I think we were just

Justice Ginsburg, in the 46

years since this Court decided Blonder-Tongue, we've

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

become accustomed to the principle of non-mutual

2

offensive collateral estoppel, that is that permits a

3

party that wasn't a party to the prior suit to raise

4

defenses that were successfully waged against another

5

party.

6

non-mutuality for all of these equitable defenses that

7

are concededly covered by unenforceability, including

8

patent misuse and inequitable conduct, which Your Honor

9

was referring to.

That principle did not exist in 1952.

There was

That is unenforceability, as all of

10

the cases recognized, and we've cited this Court's

11

opinions and lower court opinions applied to equitable

12

defenses, none of which were applicable to the law --

13

the world as a whole, prior to this Court's opinion in

Blonder-Tongue.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

issue preclusion would then work.
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, the question

10

in this case is what Congress understood the patent law

11

doctrine was in 1952.

12

there is a literal mountain of cases.

13

that was decided in any court at any level from 1897

14

when the six-year damages cap was put into place until

15

today, with the exception of one district court decision

16

in Massachusetts which demonstrably misapplied the two

17

authorities that it cited, every single case has

18

recognized that -- that laches was a defense in an

19

appropriate case to claims for damages.

And no case has

20

ever said or suggested to the contrary.

And so,

21

therefore --

22
23
24
25

And we think that there is a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Every single case

That mountain of

cases were in equity, right?
MS. SULLIVAN:

Well, in equity and in law.

There were law cases that were applied and --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's where

2

your mountain becomes a mole hill, right?

3

the -- the cases in which laches was applied at law

4

were -- is insignificant, certainly not enough to

5

support a consensus that Congress could be understood to

6

have adopted for the simple reason that -- that, as you

7

point out, actions were brought in equity, because you

8

could get both an injunction and damages.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

That's right.

I mean,

As was sought,

10

for example, in this case and almost every case, that

11

is --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a little

13

hard to talk about this mountain if they are all equity

14

cases.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Will, I don't -- I don't think

16

so, but let me take my -- let me take my run at the

17

mountain of your question.

18

As you point out, almost all of the cases,

19

98 percent, according to Professor Lemley, were brought

20

on the equity side, and they don't even have an argument

21

that laches wasn't available as a defense to claims for

22

damages which could be sought in equity courts beginning

23

in 1870, and there are plenty of cases showing that.

24

Now, there were, as Your Honor suggests,

25

that some cases -- if I just may finish -- there were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

some cases that were brought at law, usually where the

2

patent had expired and no equitable -- no injunctive

3

relief could be sought.

4

those decisions that have considered the question.

5

Every single one of those decisions that considered the

6

question -- and there are not many; there are the Ford

7

cases, the Seventh Circuit cases, I think are the ones

8

that were available before the merger in law and equity.

9

The point is, whether it's a mountain or a mole hill,

10

the cases all went in that direction, and whether the

11

petitioner thinks that those Ford cases were wrongly

12

decided or not, they were the law.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have cited the Court to

And after 1938 -But you would -- you

14

would concede that if you're just looking at those four

15

cases, that's not enough of a well-accepted consensus

16

that Congress could have considered to have adopted the

17

rule in those cases.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I don't think that when

19

Congress was -- was enacting the '52 law they were only

20

looking at the pre-1938 cases.

21

at all the cases --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They were also looking

Maybe they were -- they

23

were looking at what the statute of limitations -- what

24

the -- the origin was that equity invented laches

because there was no statute of limitation.

that when you're seeking damages at law and there is a

statute of limitations, the statute of limitations is

6

what Congress ordered, not laches.

what applied, and not an extra delay -- not an extra

doctrine.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, I will return

12

to respond to -- to complete my previous answer.

13

Justice Ginsburg, the State -- whether or not you think

14

that what is now Section 286 is a statute of limitations

15

or not, and it notably does not run from the time of

16

knowledge and -- and inactionable knowledge, unlike

17

laches and the copyright statute of limitations, the

18

fact is, that unlike in the copyright context, the 1952

19

Congress was not creating a statute of limitations of

20

sort, or even amending it.

21

provision that was put in place, by the way, in the

22

equity provision of the revised statute, Section 4120 --

But the point I'm trying to make -- and if I

6

make no other point, please let me not be misunderstood

7

here -- Congress in 1952 simply continued in haec verba

8

the statute that had existed on the books since it was

9

put in on the equity side in 1897.

And there were --

10

whether it is a mountain, a mole hill, or a mesa, all of

-- I hope I live long enough to have another case where

I can come to Court and say, all of the case law that

16

adjudicating the applicability of laches to claims of

comfortably alongside that provision.

Never mind.

I'll just stick with mountain

And there is nothing really anomalous about

that, Justice Ginsburg.

The very same thing occurs, for

25

that says you can only get two years of back pay.

You've got to bring your claim within 180

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

the fact of the matter is, the question is what was --

2

what did Congress think that it was either codifying, if

3

you accept our 282 argument, or what it was

4

interpreting -- what 286 -- what became 286 meant, it

5

looked back and it could find nothing in the case law.

6

And there are nine circuits, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

never considered the question.

9

had all recognized that laches was an applicable defense

10

in those instances in which it was proven for claims of

11

damages and other forms of relief.

came up on the law side or the equity side, and I -- I

simply.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Whether the claims

The question is not --

15

the question is not whether laches was available.

16

question is whether it was available in face of a time

limitation set by Congress.

big difference between the way the patent statute of

19

limitations work than the way the copyright statute did

20

in Petrella.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

The

And frankly, I don't see a

I -- I completely adopt your

22

articulation, Justice Ginsburg.

The question was

23

whether laches was available in the context of, and in

24

light of, the time provision that was enacted in 1897

25

and that was continued in the 1952 Act, and the answer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

is a resounding unquestionable yes.

2

There is no court, with the exception of one

3

district judge in Massachusetts, who ever even

4

questioned whether -- whether the case was brought at

5

law or in equity prior to 1938, laches was an available

6

defense.

7

that distinction still mattered in 1952, we have the

8

authoritative treatise at the time.

9

And to the extent, Mr. Chief Justice, that

Walker on patents, the 1951 edition,

10

page 106 of the 1951 provision that says expressly --

11

I'm going to quote it as soon as I find it.

12

interposed -- "laches may be interposed in an action at

13

law."

14

Law may be

And so what was Congress to understand the

15

rule was, either when it codified unenforceability as a

16

defense or when it continued Section 286 in the law as

17

it had been there for 55 years, and the answer was,

18

looking at the case law, looking at what that -- what

19

Mr. Federico was drafting for the committee and for

20

Congress, looking at the authoritative treatise writer,

21

and I'm not aware of any contemporary treatises that

22

even suggest otherwise, that, yes, laches coexists with

23

the Section 286 remedy.

24
25

And that's the question, Justice Ginsburg,
that this Court has to decide.

What was -- what was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

Congress's understanding when it enacted the 1952 Act?

2

Now, we also have --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

4

well-established understanding that laches cannot bar

5

claims for the legal relief that have their own time

6

limitation?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

So, there is a maxim, and it

8

clearly did apply.

It -- it doesn't apply in many

9

contexts, some of which are rehearsed in

10

Justice Breyer's dissent in the Petrella case.

11

any event, even if there -- even if patent law were the

12

only case, and I -- I've cited Title VII as another

13

example, but even if patent law were the only case, the

14

fact of the matter is, that what -- that as this Court

15

has explained repeatedly, including as recently as the

16

Halo decision this term -- last term, this year,

17

Congress was attempting to retain and reflect patent law

18

as it existed, not some general maxim that might apply

19

in another context.

20

the general maxim had, and there are plenty of

21

exceptions to it, in patent law, the case law was

22

uniform and substantial that --

23

But in

And in this case, whatever force

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But speaking of the general

damages remedy, Section 284.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the senator that you

15

just quoted, did he use unenforceability the -- the way

16

you do?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, he said we need to

18

include unenforceability because of the -- and this

19

is -- this is recited; I can't remember what the

20

relevant language in our red brief -- we have to amend

21

this to include unenforceability, because there are

22

doctrines that are reported in the cases -- and these

23

are all equitable doctrines, including laches -- that

24

prevent the recovery of damages where -- even if a

25

patent is determined to be valid and infringed.

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's why, he explained, there also had

2

to be an amendment in what became Section 284 so that it

3

didn't simply apply damages to patents that were valid

4

and infringed but only in cases in which the plaintiff

5

isn't otherwise entitled.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the problem with

12

things that are specified.

MR. WAXMAN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I still don't see in the

15

history where the people who were drafting at the time,

16

not two years later or time later, really were thinking

17

of this in the way you're speaking of.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Sotomayor, you are

19

correct that in amending the statute to include an

20

unenforceability defense, and again, I want to reiterate

21

that even if you don't think unenforceability applies to

22

the litany of equitable defenses that have long since

23

been imported into substantive patent law on both sides,

24

even if you don't agree with that, you still have to

25

interpret 286, which they claim is the bar to the

application of laches against a backdrop of uniform,

2

very substantial case law from every circuit that

3

considered the question, that recognized that laches

4

was, in fact, such a defense.

5

But you -- you are --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You won't get very far

7

with me on that, because I don't know how to import

8

something in that's not stated by Congress in any way.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

What is stated by Congress, and

10

this Court has accepted repeatedly, is that Congress in

11

1952 intended to retain and reflect patent law as it

12

existed, and that's why, for example, this Court found,

13

even though there is no codification, that the doctrine

14

of equivalence is still applicable after the 1952 Act,

15

even though nothing was said about it.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

There is a whole series

17

of decisions in the courts of appeal.

19

text.

On the legal

MR. WAXMAN:

This Court is never estopped

from anything that it doesn't think it's estopped from.

But the legal -- the legal question in the

2

case, Justice Ginsburg, is what did Congress in -- did

3

Congress in -- in enacting the 1952 Act intend to retain

4

and reflect the patent law, laches case law, as it

5

intended to retain and reflect patent law in general?

6

And there are -- I mean, I gave you the example, for

7

example, to Justice Sotomayor's question of where was

8

the -- you know, an express intent to include laches, I

9

gave you the example of the doctrine of equivalence.

10

There are many, many other doctrines that

11

were continued and that this Court has found were

12

continued.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

A weak point in your

14

argument is all -- most of those prior cases were --

15

were equity cases, but the weak point's weakened because

16

most of those equity cases after 1897 were under

17

provisions that had a statute of limitations, and the

18

reason you didn't have laches in equity is because it

didn't have a statute of limitations.

But here you did

So you have all those cases; that's your

argument.

And I'm -- I'm actually just trying to

23

summarize it so you'll tell me where it's not correct.

24

MR. WAXMAN:

I just want to strengthen it.

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Strengthen it, but

Official - Subject to Final Review

when you strengthen it, will you please spend about a

which now has been seriously undercut, and I want to be

4

sure you have a chance to address it.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

And this is --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was -- I was afraid of --

7

and I think I might have been well wrong to be afraid of

8

it -- but moved in part by the Dell brief, I was afraid

9

that a person with a patent or the transferee of that

10

patent, in year 2, would have told the -- a licensee, go

11

right ahead, go ahead, or not said anything when he

12

could have or something like that, that would have given

13

rise to laches.

14

on technology that is very hard to change.

That licensee would have spent billions

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then in year 18, this

17

person, now the transferee of the patent, sues him, and

18

he is going to get six years worth of profits and

19

nothing deducted.

20

wrong because what you would have done is gone back to

21

year two, figured out a reasonable rate of return, and

22

that's what it would have gotten.

23

Now they have told me that's totally

I'm still a little worried that he brings

the same lawsuit in 19 -- year 19, year 20, years

25

thereafter, and thereby really fixes this guy who has,

MR. WAXMAN:

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you.

6

Justice Breyer, the Dell brief is one of a

7

dozen briefs that addresses the very significant

8

consequences to extending Petrella to the very, very

9

different statutory and commercial context.

The -- the

10

industry as a whole, across the board, is so clear that

11

-- that laches should apply and continue to apply, that

12

the -- the Intellectual Property Owner's Association,

13

the group that represents people against whom laches are

14

asserted, has told this Court in an amicus brief

15

supporting neither party that laches existed, exists,

16

and should continue to exist in this case.

17

reason why is, in addition to --

course we're now just talking about retrospective

2

damages.

3

and -- and explained first in 1880 in the Menendez case,

4

laches can apply when the -- the severity that the

5

unreasonableness, and inexcusably, the delay is long

6

enough, and the prejudice is substantial, to defeat all

7

forms of remedy.

8
9

And as this Court explained in Petrella,

But the prejudice here is that, unlike in
the copyright area where Congress adds -- adds two whole

10

Roman numerals of this majority's opinion, and Petrella

11

explains, there are many, many signals otherwise in the

12

way that the copyright law is constructed, that Congress

13

was knowledgeably and intentionally assuming and

14

accepting that -- that claims would be brought years and

15

years after the fact that would limit the damages to

16

only those net profits for three years out of the

17

hundred-plus years of the copyright life.

18

In this case, we are talking about six years

19

of a 20 -- really more like 17 years -- and we are

20

talking about instances recounted in the amicus briefs

21

in which defendants are locked in.

just defendants in copyright law.

And they are not

In order to be a defendant, you have to

litigation, according to his submission.

two?

reason why this Court has never addressed it.

settled, that in this very case in which the plaintiff

sued for an injunction and damages and laches was

Patent law is an important branch of the

precedent were very clear before 1952 -- in Homebrook in

21

remedy, you could not go to the equity court.

6

under the Root case, and naked accounting was not an

That's

So plaintiffs would go to the equity court.
They would seek an injunction, and then they would

10

get -- as additional remedy if they survived the

11

liability phase and the laches findings, they would then

go on to -- go to see a Special Master to deal with an

The number of damages cases, if you really

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Black, I take it

22

that Mr. Waxman's principal point is that what separates

23

out the patent context is that laches was operating true

24

in equity but with a statute of limitations, and that

25

that just wasn't true in other places.

Alderson Reporting Company

The Congress was

Official - Subject to Final Review

used to the notion that laches would operate with a

2

statute of limitations in place.

3

So what's your response to that?

4

MR. BLACK:

Laches could bar the suit in

5

equity, but -- and then the plaintiff was out of court

6

but not on the law side.

7

available to the plaintiff.

8
9

On the law side, damages were

There was an overall -- there was an overall
requirement, though, in Section 286.

And in the

10

original 1897 version, which was just called a statute

11

of limitations, that said no matter what, if you're in

12

law, if you're in equity, you cannot get damages more

13

than six years before suit.

14

But what happened in the equity courts is

15

the courts would take a look at whether or not the

16

plaintiff had clean enough hands to continue pursuing

17

the case.

18

courts had that power which was granted to them back at

19

common law -- not in common law -- back in England, and

20

they exercised the power to say, you know what, equity

21

is not going to help you because you waited too long.

Not true on the law side.

23

And if they'd waited too long, the equity

Now, my opponent says there weren't any
