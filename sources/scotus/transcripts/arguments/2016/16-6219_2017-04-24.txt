ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH KRETZER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. KRETZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The nature and logic of Martinez naturally

11

applies to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate

12

counsel, just as it does to claims of ineffective

13

assistance of trial counsel.

14

Erick Davila faces execution despite having

15

been convicted pursuant to erroneous jury instructions

16

that vitiated his only viable defense.

17

appeal, Davila's counsel recognized the centrality of

18

the intent issue, but challenged only sufficiency of the

19

evidence --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. KRETZER:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

On direct

But I have --

-- not the jury instructions.
May I ask you, when do

23

you believe that counsel below objected?

24

seems to assume he did, but as I read the transcript, I

25

can't find where he objected clearly.

Alderson Reporting Company

And your brief

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

Assuming he didn't object clearly, can you

2

say under any circumstance that appellate counsel was

3

ineffective for choosing the route he did?

4

MR. KRETZER:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your -Given plain error

6

review, if there was no objection, wasn't the

7

sufficiency of the evidence the best way to approach a

8

forfeited error?

9

MR. KRETZER:

Well, as an initial matter, it

10

must be remembered that plain error is not the standard

11

in Texas.

12

made, all that happens under Almanza is the standard of

13

review turns to -- from harm to egregious harm, which is

14

less incisive for Petitioners than plain error standard,

15

which prevails in Federal court.

Even if a jury instructional objection is not

16

But, more importantly, the trial counsel did

17

object, particularly at page 52 of the Joint Appendix --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He objected to the

19

sequence of what the judge was saying.

20

any transferred intent in the way that the Court later

21

found in Roberts.

I think it's Roberts, if I'm --

22

MR. KRETZER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

He didn't argue

Yes.
-- if my memory is

correct.
MR. KRETZER:

Yes.

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He didn't -- I don't see

2

any discussion of the Roberts transferred intent.

3

he argued was, give the original instruction over again,

4

and then give this new one.

5

MR. KRETZER:

Oh, no, he did not say, then

6

please do give the new one.

7

objection could have been better calibrated.

8

the closing, a discrete, complete sentence said, we

object to giving of the supplemental instruction.

There's no doubt the
And yet

10

immediately thereafter, the State trial judge said,

11

overruled.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

13

MR. KRETZER:

14

All

And

But, counsel --

And it must be remembered --

oh --

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's

Sorry, counsel.

17

point, I think you argued at page 228 of the Joint

18

Appendix that trial counsel's objection was not

19

sufficient to cover the charging error, and I think that

20

the Federal district court on habeas found the same

21

thing on page 366.

22

And so that raises, to my mind, a question

23

whether Martinez applies here.

24

your client have brought a Martinez claim?

25

the Martinez rule premised on the idea you get one clear

Couldn't -- couldn't

Alderson Reporting Company

And isn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

shot at bringing the issue?

2

absence of one clear shot here would bring you within

3

the rule of Martinez, and that would take care of this

4

case.

And -- and maybe the

5

What am I missing there?

6

MR. KRETZER:

7

The reason this could not have been couched

Yes, absolutely.

8

as a Martinez ineffective assistance of trial claim in

9

Federal habeas is, even if the objection had not been

10

proper to preserve the issue in the Texas State court,

11

and then in the court of criminal appeals, there's still

12

no way that the direct appellate attorney argued the

13

issue either way.

14

In other words, what should have happened,

15

the conforming, constitutionally sufficient direct

16

appellate brief should have argued jury instructional

17

error.

18

objection had been preserved by the objection has harm

19

under Almanza, or alternatively, that the objection of

20

the trial court was not sufficient to preserve the

21

objection, and then would move to egregious harm under

22

Almanza.

23

underlying error for the State direct appellate attorney

24

to argue against.

25

And then first in the situation that the

But in no case, in no situation was there no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

One -- one thing a

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

good appellate lawyer will do is pare down the issues

2

that are presented on appeal, even if they think that

3

some of those issues have merit.

4

six issues that you think you can argue credibly before

5

the -- before the appellate court, you may decide it

6

would be much better to focus that court on the two or

7

three strongest issues, that adding the others will, in

8

fact, dilute from the value of that.

9

I mean, if you have

So when you have these -- I'm not talking

10

about this particular case.

11

have the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate

12

counsel, it's sometimes easy in retrospect to say, well,

13

here's an issue that, you know, maybe -- the appellate

14

counsel, in the exercise of discretion, thought it was

15

like number 6 in the order of -- of strength.

16

look back and in hindsight you say, well, he should have

17

made more of that, and it's not even mentioned at all in

18

the appellate brief.

19

But in general, when you

And you

I mean, I know there's also issues of trial

20

strategy, but it seems it's more typical in an appellate

21

case that you have -- you know, you leave things off the

22

table.

23

your view, in evaluating the effectiveness of appellate

24

counsel?

25

Is -- is that going to present a problem, in

MR. KRETZER:

No, it will not.

Alderson Reporting Company

There's no

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

doubt that appellate attorneys retain substantial

2

discretion to not raise certain claims that are regarded

3

to be necessarily weaker.

4

presumably almost all appellate lawyers have to

5

necessarily not raise some claims.

6

backstop of our argument is substantiality.

7

In fact, in a trial,

That's why the

In other words, it's not one thing to raise

8

an appellate claim that might have, you know,

9

theoretically gotten you somewhere, and yet not likely

10

to have gotten a reversal in the reviewing State court

11

of appeals.

12

claim, by which we mean, in this context, one that --

13

and this is sort of a distinction that Federal district

14

judges make all the time in habeas -- but the question

15

here would be whether or not it was likely that that

16

claim would have resulted in a different outcome in the

17

reviewing court of appeals.

18

It is very difficult to raise a substantial

And the case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in this actual case,

19

didn't the district court hold that the ineffective

20

assistance of appellate counsel argument, on the merits,

21

it was insubstantial?

22

insubstantial, then we didn't -- we don't even have to

23

get to the question you would like to present to us.

24
25

And if -- if it was

Wasn't it an alternative holding that, in
any case, this objection to the instruction was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1
2

insubstantial?
MR. KRETZER:

Yes.

The Federal district

3

court did make an alternative holding on the merits.

4

However, that was not addressed in the Fifth Circuit's

5

opinion, and was, hence, not a part of the judgment that

6

was appealed to this Court.

7

So at the minimum, we would ask for relief

8

as the same which this Court afforded in Martinez, which

9

is a remand to the reviewing court of appeals -- in that

10

case, the Ninth Circuit -- for a determination as to

11

that prejudice -- prejudice prong.

12

Mr. Martinez was ultimately unsuccessful in Federal

13

district court in Arizona on the prejudice prong.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, in fact,

You're not in Missouri -Well, on the -- on the

16

issue of whether or not Martinez should be extended to

17

alleged inadequate assistance of counsel on appeal, what

18

is the test that I'm supposed to apply?

19

practicality of this?

20

interests of the prisoners and the public interest

21

in finality -- is that what I'm supposed -- is there

22

some test you want me to apply?

The consequences?

23

MR. KRETZER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

The -- the
The private

Oh -And when this test is

applied, I -- I have -- have to say, it was somewhat

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

stunning to me to read at page 15 of your brief that one

2

study indicates that although 81 percent of habeas

3

petitions in capital cases raise a claim of ineffective

4

assistance of counsel, only 31 percent alleged

5

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, that's a

6

third of the cases.

7

This is a tremendous burden.

MR. KRETZER:

Well, to answer your question,

8

no, the test that we -- the standard we would ask you to

9

apply is the same that was in Martinez.

Basically,

10

first, was there a substantial claim?

11

claim defaulted in the initial review collateral

12

proceeding?

13

Did -- was that

And when we say "substantial," we mean one

14

that was likely to result in a different outcome.

15

That's why the claims will be very rare of --

16

substantial claims of ineffective appellate counsel.

17

And yet when they do exist, they will likely be

18

incredibly meritorious claims --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, but my question was,

20

was the systemic one, is -- is what are the systemic

21

standards I look to, to see whether or not we should

22

extend Martinez to this kind of case?

23

MR. KRETZER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

I have?

Oh, yes.
And then what guidance do

It looked like Mathews v. Eldridge.

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm the

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

one that -- or this Court's the one that balances?

2

MR. KRETZER:

Well, yes, in Martinez, this

3

Court particularly created an equitable rule in the

4

exercise of this Court's discretion saying that there

5

would be an exception as it were to cause and the cause

6

and prejudice inquiry, because otherwise you would have

7

petitioners who would never have any forum in which this

8

ineffective assistance claim could be litigated.

9

The door has been opened in Martinez now for

10

over 5 years.

11

petitions in Federal court.

12

There has not been an inundation of new
And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One -- one

13

significant distinction, of course, is that these claims

14

of appellate assistance -- ineffective appellate

15

assistance of counsel, under the logic can be raised in

16

every State.

17

State has funneled the decisions to collateral review.

18

Martinez, Trevino, it's only where the

Appellate claims like this, you know,

19

obviously can't be brought on appeal in every State, and

20

so this would arise, in terms of evaluating the

21

statistics, it would be many, many times the numbers of

22

Martinez claims that you see, and we see -- and -- and

23

there are now an awful lot of Martinez claims anyway.

24
25

MR. KRETZER:

In Martinez, what Arizona had

done was said as a statutory matter, you cannot raise an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

ineffective assistance contention in the direct appeal.

2

Instead it was deliberately channeled over to habeas.

3

There's a reason that in a claim like

4

Mr. Davila's that the initial review collateral

5

opportunity to challenge the claim of ineffective

6

contention is State habeas, and that is because it is

7

impossible, physically impossible --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I've got --

I've got to -- do -- for them to raise the appellate --

10

MR. KRETZER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, themselves -I'm sorry to cut you

12

off, but I -- I understand that, but that's going to be

13

true in every State, right?

14

going to have the same difficulty of raising

15

ineffectiveness of appellate counsel on direct review in

16

every -- every State.

17
18
19

MR. KRETZER:

It's going to be -- you're

Yes, that would be a uniform

impossible -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

Martinez, one

20

of the important considerations at least for some in

21

Martinez is that it is narrow.

22

State has funneled the ineffective assistance at trial

23

claims to collateral review.

24
25

MR. KRETZER:
at the vantage point.

It's only where the

I would ask the Court to look

In Martinez, there was not a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

mechanism by which the States were punished for removing

2

the claim from what -- direct appeal to habeas.

3

an equitable exception in favor of the petitioner,

4

because if the equitable exception were not there, then

5

petitioners would suffer the reality, there would be

6

no court ever --

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It was

Counsel, you're not

dealing with the question asked.

9

MR. KRETZER:

10

Okay.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

The question

11

asked has to do with the burden on the courts.

12

Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts are saying, if we

13

recognize this right, the courts are going to be

14

inundated with these kinds of claims because in every

15

State, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel

16

isn't -- can't be, by definition, raised in direct

17

review.

It all has to be channelled to collateral

18

review.

So in every State, every defendant will be able

19

to raise this claim and it will inundate the -- the

20

system.

21

MR. KRETZER:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

articulated the reasons you don't think so.

We don't think so.

24

MR. KRETZER:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

Both

The --

And you haven't

I would -I could start with how

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

many post-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate

2

counsel cases, the 31 percent that Justice Kennedy was

3

pointing to, in how many of those is relief granted?

4
5

MR. KRETZER:

If any, a very minute number,

because it is so --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. KRETZER:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Infinitesimally small.

Yes.
Are there hearings

in those cases --

10

MR. KRETZER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

For --- cranting the

12

necessity for the court to evaluate the claims before

13

they decide not to grant the -- the allegation --

14

MR. KRETZER:

No, very rarely are there

15

actually Strickland hearings on 2254 in Federal district

16

court, for the reason that it's very hard to, one, show

17

a substantial claim, and then, two, to reach through

18

the --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The court presumably

20

has to read the -- the filings in the case to decide

21

that the claim is not substantial, correct?

22
23
24
25

MR. KRETZER:

Yes, it would be necessary for

the court -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so the number

that are granted really isn't the consideration we're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

looking to, is it?

2

force the courts to review them.

3

It's the number that are going to

MR. KRETZER:

Well, I think if one accepts

4

that for now, 4 or 5 years Martinez has been the law

5

and -- and a number of these claims have been made, at

6

most there might be, in a small subset of those, a very

7

small number of additional ineffective assistance of

8

appellate counsel claims made because it is so hard for

9

a petitioner to formulate such a claim.

10

For a Petitioner such as Mr. Davila, to have

11

raised a claim like this on his own, of course, Martinez

12

talked a lot about the importance of having an effective

13

assistance of counsel to vindicate an underlying

14

ineffectiveness contention, Mr. Davila would have had to

15

have been familiar with the jury charge, he would have

16

had have been -- with the Texas law --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, are

18

you saying it would have been hard to formulate?

19

you suggesting that someone facing this sentence that

20

Mr. Davila is facing would say, well, let's not do that,

21

let's not raise an ineffective assistance of appellate

22

counsel or somewhere and said, because it's just too

23

hard to formulate that claim?

Are

24

These are situations where the defendant is

25

facing capital punishment where they are going to raise

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

every possible claim they can, and I don't know why it

2

would be terribly different for defendants facing life

3

in prison or further sentences.

4

MR. KRETZER:

Well, the -- as I said,

5

there's a very difference between raising every possible

6

claim that they could versus a lawyer's obligation to

7

raise meritorious, not raise frivolous claims.

8

there may be at the margin some additional claim that

9

perhaps when it's sifted through is found not to

And

10

ultimately be successful.

11

claim is one that necessarily, when it does exist, is

12

going to be one that which -- about which there does

13

need to be a hearing about the underlying

14

ineffectiveness.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

We would argue a substantial

What concerns me about your

16

position is that it seems to blast an enormous hole in

17

the doctrine of procedural default.

18

unlike Trevino, which were cabined, it -- it seems to

19

me, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, that if we agree

20

with your position, then anything that -- that an

21

attorney in Federal habeas can examine the trial record,

22

and if that attorney finds anything that seems to be an

23

error, it can be raised in Federal habeas, even if there

24

was no objection at the time of trial, it wasn't raised

25

on direct appeal, it wasn't raised in a State collateral

Alderson Reporting Company

Unlike Martinez and

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

proceeding.

That's where this is going.

2

And if it's an -- if the underlying error is

3

ineffective assistance of counsel, well, whatever it is,

4

all of that will be evaluated by the Federal habeas

5

court outside of AEDPA.

6

So this is an enormous hole.

7

That's where this is going.

Am I not -- isn't that where this -- isn't

8

that what this means?

9

Federal habeas would be there was cause because counsel

Because the -- the argument in

10

was ineffective at the collateral -- State collateral

11

proceeding, and this counsel was ineffective at the

12

State collateral proceeding because there was

13

ineffective assistance on direct appeal.

14

counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because there

15

was an error at trial.

16

And then

So the Federal habeas court has to make all

17

of those determinations, and if the court -- the --

18

which means the court is going to have to look at

19

whether or not there was an error at trial and, in doing

20

that, it is not going to be asking whether a -- whether

21

a State court reasonably rejected the claim because it

22

was never presented to the State court.

23

to be de novo review.

24
25

MR. KRETZER:

So it's going

It would be very difficult --

the situation is not simply -- the task for the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

habeas petitioner is not to simply aggregate every

2

objected to or unobjected to evidentiary error or any

3

downline error and simply present all of those in the

4

Federal habeas petition.

5

What they would then have to do is also find

6

some authority from the State court of appeals saying

7

that this type of error or constellation of errors would

8

constitute a reversible error.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they'd have to find

10

something that they can argue in the Federal habeas was

11

an error, but procedural default would be out the

12

window.

13

MR. KRETZER:

Well, yes, but, again, it's

14

not enough to simply say these were the trial errors.

15

One would have to say that these were trial errors and

16

here's some reason why the reviewing court of appeals

17

would have held differently.

18

from --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's very different

Right.

And the Federal

20

habeas court is going to have to analyze that, which

21

means the Federal habeas court is going to have to

22

analyze all of these alleged trial errors that were

23

never previously raised in the State court.

24
25

MR. KRETZER:

Our argument would simply be

it's one thing to make a -- state this error or that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

error happened at the trial.

2

some error that occurred in it.

3

do to create a substantial claim, in other words, not

4

one that would be very easily discarded by the Federal

5

district court would be then to say, here's a reason why

6

this would create a different outcome.

7

be easy to do for downline claims, but when one gets to

8

claims as important or as vital as jury instructional

9

errors, those are a type of substantial claim that --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, every trial has
But one would have to

That would not

Say, so what -- you started

11

to say this, but I guess Martinez itself, one of the

12

concerns was that any mistake that the trial -- that the

trial attorney makes -- and normally, by the way, you --

14

you don't make ineffective assistance counsel claims on

15

direct appeal, I don't think.

16

lawyer.

17

It's usually the same

You have to make it in State habeas.
Okay.

What would happen would be that the

18

defendant with a new lawyer in Federal habeas would go

19

through every mistake that the trial court made, that

20

the -- that the trial lawyer made, and say it was

21

ineffective assistance of counsel.

would have to do just what Justice Alito said, though

perhaps a few fewer States.

It's five years.

Martinez claim proved a burden on Federal court?

there any empirical information?

3

MR. KRETZER:

Is

We don't think there had

4

been -- there may have been additional -- Martinez and

5

now Martinez-Trevino claims that had been made in

6

Federal petitions, but not an increase in the number or

7

appreciable increase in the number of Federal

petition --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I -- I asked you

10

really, is there any empirical information?

11

course, I think you probably think no.

12

side may think yes.

13

know, is there any -- anyplace I could look to find out

14

whether it has proved to be a burden or not, where there

15

have been a lot of claims or not?

16

Because, of

But the other

And so that's what I would like to

MR. KRETZER:

Yes.

We do have some studies

17

cited, and certainly I will get them to have ready to

18

present in the -- in the rebuttal.

19

But our point would be that, again, if the

20

rule of Martinez is still the rule, and if it is not

21

also applied to

22

ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims, then

23

Petitioners, like Mr. Davila, are actually worse off if

24

their trial lawyer did object than if they did not.

25

they did object, they -- they had not objected down at

Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

21

trial court, they would already be covered by the

2

Martinez -- this is a very modest application of

3

Martinez that we don't think will create appreciable --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But Martinez concerned

5

ineffective assistance of counsel in a limited number of

6

States, and Trevino arguably extended it to a few

7

additional States.

8

applies everywhere, and it's not limited to ineffective

9

assistance of counsel.

But if we accept your argument, it

It is -- it applies to every

10

single -- every single type of error that could occur at

11

trial.

12

MR. KRETZER:

No.

We would disagree.

13

Certainly, the only issue -- Martinez and Trevino, of

14

course, were limited.

15

assistance of trial claims.

16

were presented in those cases.

17

don't think that this Court necessarily, if you rule in

18

our favor in this case, that has application anywhere

19

beyond ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel

20

claims.

21

It talked about ineffective

JUSTICE ALITO:

Those were the claims that
That was different.

Yeah.

But the ineffective

22

assistance of appellate counsel would be based on any

23

type of error that occurred at trial.

24
25

We

So here you have a jury instruction error.
But if we agree with you, it would apply to the

22
1

erroneous introduction of evidence, to the -- to

2

improper statements made in closing, to any type of

3

trial error, any type of constitutional trial error you

4

can dream of.

5

Martinez, this goes way, way, way beyond Martinez.

6

Trevino.

7

So whatever the statistics are on

MR. KRETZER:

And

I would say that, again, the

8

only -- if Martinez is the rule and those -- Martinez

9

claims were about ineffective assistance of trial

10

counsel now, have been made for at least five years.

11

There is not, as Justice Breyer said, a large number of

12

claims made contending ineffective assistance of

13

appellate counsel.

14

that the Martinez doctrine do apply.

15

And that's why it's so important

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't think that's -- I

16

think, as I'm gathering Justice Alito's point -- and I

17

think it's an -- you know, it's an interesting point and

18

important, what is ineffective assistance of appellate

19

counsel?

20

assistance of trial counsel, but it can't just be an

21

ordinary mistake.

22

special.

I mean, I understand somewhat ineffective

It has to be something rather

23

MR. KRETZER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes.
Now, is ineffective

assistance of appellate counsel the same, or is an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

appellate counsel ineffective whenever the appellate

2

counsel fails to present a claim that the trial judge

3

made a mistake in the trial?

4

MR. KRETZER:

The Strickland standard for

5

ineffective assistance is the same for contentions of

6

ineffective assistance of trial counsel and ineffective

7

assistance of appellate counsel.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it's very hard to see

when it would be ineffective assistance when there

10

wasn't also ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

11

What is such a case?

12

it, but what -- what is a case where -- where there's

13

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but not

14

ineffective assistance of trial counsel?

15

case?

16

I mean, I'm just probably missing

MR. KRETZER:

Yes.

What is that

Certainly evidence is

17

seen in Mr. Davila's case, because there is, in Texas,

18

jury instructional error is not forfeitable.

19

words, there is not some -- unless the trial

20

lawyer objects, there's necessarily --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

In other

So then why didn't the

22

trial counsel -- this -- I can see that this was a very

23

important matter for this particular defendant, but then

24

why wasn't the trial counsel ineffective?

25

MR. KRETZER:

Well, again, the trial counsel

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

did formulate -- maybe not the best calibrated -- but

2

did formulate an objection.

3

which this arose in this case is very unusual in that

4

neither the -- the State never requested a

5

transferred-intent instruction.

6

The -- I think the way in

After the jury, which had been out for over

7

four hours at this point with those confessions, sent

8

out that jury note No. 2 asking directly about the

9

theory of Mr. --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what about saying

11

this:

12

situation, you know, you have ineffective assistance --

13

you have ineffective appellate counsel.

14

obviously, you can't raise it because he was

15

ineffective.

16

catch-22.

17

Suppose we said, yes, there is -- it's the same

Well,

So you never had a shot at it.

It's

Same with the trial counsel.
But those things, it's very unlikely that

18

you're going to have ineffective assistant of appellate

19

counsel where there wasn't also the ineffective

20

assistance of trial counsel.

21

such an instance.

22

mistake is failure to bring an ordinary mistake will

23

unlikely to be qualified.

24
25

It's very hard to think of

And just the bringing of an ordinary

Suppose we wrote that into the opinion or
the equivalent.

What would you think of that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

MR. KRETZER:

I think the problem is that

2

the question here is not a Strickland determination as

3

to the direct appellate attorney in this case.

4

may have been a strategic reason not to raise the claim.

5

I would rather be skeptical, considering the

6

direct appellate brief specifically did not request oral

7

argument.

8

against or anything like that, but that would be

9

something that would be sorted out at a Strickland

There

There were no page limitations they were up

11

reason for doing or not doing something, would be

12

pressed out in detail.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, we spent a lot of

14

time talking about Martinez, but one case we haven't

15

discussed is Coleman.

16

MR. KRETZER:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes.
And Coleman sets out the

18

general rule that ineffective assistance by counsel in

19

collateral review does not suffice to establish cause

20

for purposes of Federal habeas.

21

rule.

22

when there wouldn't be any chance to raise an issue in

23

State court at all.

24

trial court counsel could have raised this issue.

25

all admit that.

That's the general

And Martinez carves out a small exception for

about the merits.

We also ask about the reliance

The Coleman rule bars

from the hearing on the habeas petition in Federal -- in

Martinez is very clear that there was not a

Alderson Reporting Company

habeas, or if they declined the State-appointed

2

attorney, the attorney the State offered to appoint.

3

All of those situations would still be barred by the

4

rule in Coleman, so Coleman is very much good law.

5

Martinez simply looked at -- at peace that

6

was arguing dicta in Coleman, whether or not the

7

ineffectiveness was in that initial review collateral

8

proceeding itself, and that's the situation we have

9

here.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If I may ask one question

11

about your -- your bottom line.

12

if counsel had taken up -- challenged the instruction on

13

direct appeal, it would have led to a new trial.

14

MR. KRETZER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think you said that

Yes.
Why a new trial?

Why

16

isn't the consequence of ineffective assistance of

17

appellate counsel not a new trial of the case, but just

18

a new State court appeal?

19

MR. KRETZER:

Oh, yes.

Well, the remedy --

20

the Federal remedy that we're seeking would be leave to

21

file a additional supplemental direct appeal in State

22

court, at which the argument would first be made that

23

the jury instructional challenge was the harm standard

24

of Almanza, or alternatively, under the egregious harm

25

standard of Almanza.

But with the -- ultimate new trial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28

would, of course, have to be upon prevailing on a new

2

direct appeal in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

So I will save the balance of my time for

rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

GENERAL KELLER:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Extending Martinez to appellate-IAC claims

12

will have a huge systemic cost by opening up the entire

13

trial and everything that happened at trial to Federal

14

habeas review.

15

Justice Sotomayor noted, is there's an infinitesimally

16

small number of meritorious appellate IAC claims.

17

you're going to have huge costs --

18

And the countervailing concern, as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

Ah, but does that --

19

does that mean that we don't remedy that?

20

because, I agree -- Justice Breyer pointed out, and

21

others have, the number of cases are going to be tiny.

22

And as with all cases, there's an initial uptick of

23

claims until people settle down and realize that it's a

24

small number that are viable, and that happens pretty

25

quickly.

Assuming --

Do we ignore that simply because there might

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

be that small uptick at the beginning?

2

GENERAL KELLER:

3

is still the rule.

4

Coleman.

5

Well, this is why Coleman

Martinez expressly reaffirmed

Outside of that narrow context at trial -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You mean the substantial

6

claim of IAC?

7

at an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim,

8

assuming one is viable, unless there's a substantial

9

claim, and no one will otherwise look at it.

10

This is -- no one is going to be looking

GENERAL KELLER:

Well, and here, the

11

question is -- the relevant appellate IAC claims to look

12

at here are those where the claim was raised in trial

13

court, and the trial court did, in fact, adjudicate,

14

decide the issue.

15

appellate and habeas counsel have chosen not to raise

16

it.

17

It made a record, and then both

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

And just -- just to

18

fortify your point, I take it there are any number of

19

defense counsel objections that are overruled.

20

defense counsel has been adequate, but then if -- but

21

then the appellate counsel may very well overlook some

22

of those.

23

there's not going to be IAC at the appellate level if

24

there was not IAC at the trial level, it seems to me,

25

not -- not sound.

So

And that -- and so -- so the idea that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

GENERAL KELLER:

Justice Kennedy, and

2

when -- here, there -- there's no dispute that trial

3

counsel was effective.

4

claim about the supplemental jury instruction.

5

They have not raised a trial IAC

And so while appellate IAC claims are

6

difficult to prevail, there -- it's going to be even

7

more difficult in this situation, because the trial IAC

8

gateway that Martinez already provides would give a

9

petitioner everything they needed if trial counsel was

10

ineffective.

11

if trial counsel does preserve it, and the trial court

12

does decide the issue, then both appellate and habeas

13

counsel choose not to raise it, it's going to be an

14

exponentially lower chance that those claims are going

15

to be meritorious.

16

So if trial counsel does raise the claim,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you address my

17

question to the Petitioner's counsel?

18

standard of -- we're supposed to follow in deciding this

19

case?

20

and what is -- what -- what is the case authority that

21

gives us instruction in that regard?

22

What is the

Our view of the systemic consequences?

GENERAL KELLER:

And --

Martinez itself recognized

23

that what it was doing creating the narrow exception

24

from Coleman was that was an equitable judgment.

25

fashioning the rule, the Court looked at -- it was

Alderson Reporting Company

And in

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

trying to maintain a baseline where no court had ever

2

adjudicated the underlying claim of trial error, and the

3

Court recognized the bedrock foundation unique right to

4

trial counsel.

5

plus the channelling concern, those were the three

6

pillars of Martinez, and none of those three pillars are

7

present here.

8
9

And putting together those two factors,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
three pillars here.

So let's go through the

No one is reviewing whether

10

appellate counsel has been adequate.

11

you're not entitled constitutionally to appellate

12

counsel on direct appeal, I don't know that we haven't,

13

repeatedly, and so has every other court recognized the

14

importance of counsel at the appellate level.

15

virtually every State, if not every State, gives you a

16

lawyer.

Do you -- although

So that prong is, in my mind, equal.

17

The second prong is the --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

first?

I think

Could you respond to that

Is that okay, Justice Sotomayor?

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Because -- because there

22

is -- there's no right -- there's no need to have an

23

appellate process, but once the State has given an

24

appellate process, there is a right to have effective

25

assistance of counsel on appeal.

So that seems an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

important right.

2

GENERAL KELLER:

Every appellate IAC claim

3

is necessarily going to, though, be based on an

4

underlying issue of an alleged trial error.

5

words, this is going to be a -- to use the words of

6

prisoner's counsel in Martinez v. Ryan, appellate IAC

7

claims are a second order claim.

They are going to be

8

based on what happened at trial.

And the trial court

9

will have already adjudicated that claim of underlying

In other

10

trial error in the relevant set of cases that any

11

extension of Martinez could apply to.

12

if the court --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because, again,

I'm sorry.

I -- I --

14

they're only -- they're not asking the question on the

15

trial court whether appellate counsel has erred.

16

are asking a different question.

17

GENERAL KELLER:

That's correct.

They

But an

18

appellate IAC claim necessarily says, my appellate

19

counsel didn't raise an issue and that issue is

20

something that happened at trial that I thought was

21

error.

22
23
24
25

That issue is -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Not just error, but

error likely to result in a different outcome.
GENERAL KELLER:

Yes.

However, that alleged

trial error that would have resulted in a different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

outcome would have been, in fact, adjudicated in the

2

trial court already.

3

In --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we already know that

4

even under plain-error review, because we've done it

5

in -- in a number of different cases, that trial courts

6

err.

7

GENERAL KELLER:

But if -- if the Court were

8

reviewing this under plain error, though --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The question is, did

10

appellate counsel err in failing to raise something that

11

might ultimately go to the Supreme Court, as has

12

happened.

13

GENERAL KELLER:

The Martinez trial IAC

14

gateway, though, that already exists, would cover any

15

claim that was not, in fact, preserved in the trial

16

court.

17

to extend Martinez to situations where the trial court

18

has, in fact, already ruled on the case.

19

this case concerns would be a doubly defaulted claim of

20

trial --

21

So what the Court is confronting now is whether

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So really what

They have ruled on --

22

they've ruled on a question of error below, but not a

23

question of appellate counsel error.

24
25

GENERAL KELLER:

That -- that's right.

precise ruling on the appellate counsel issue, that

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

claim in particular, would not have been passed upon.

2

However, that claim is necessarily predicated on an

3

issue of a -- an alleged trial error that would have

4

been adjudicated, and that neither appellate nor habeas

5

counsel raised it.

6

And in that situation, when you'd have to

7

have three levels of error, there's going to be an

8

infinitesimally small number of cases that are

9

meritorious, combined with opening up the entire trial,

10

every single issue, even State law objections to Federal

11

habeas review.

12

something akin to Fay v. Noia, which was overruled --

13

That would be taking the Court back to

JUSTICE BREYER:

The same question that I

14

had before.

15

which a trial counsel might have objected but didn't, in

16

principle, could be the subject of Martinez.

17

that's quite a few.

18

any less.

19

information anywhere about whether -- any empirical

20

information about whether habeas courts, Federal habeas

21

courts, have been deluged, or have -- do we know?

I -- I mean, every -- every instance in

I suppose

I don't know there are any more or

So what's actually happened?

GENERAL KELLER:

25

GENERAL KELLER:

-- Martinez has been cited

The answer is yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

In our

was just the latest in a long line of cases where this

18

that right as unique, that would be an exception to

19

procedural bars that would apply otherwise.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the Court justified
Martinez

Is it fair to say several

pertinent in assessing the significance of the number of

12

times this issue is going to be raised?

13

GENERAL KELLER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

It absolutely would.
If it's going to be

raised in 50 States rather than two?

16

GENERAL KELLER:

It would.

And this goes to

17

the point that Martinez recognized, that there --

18

there's an external factor.

19

by the State to channel a claim.

20

here.

21

There's a deliberate choice
That's not present

And it will apply in all 50 States.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, yes, that's true, but

22

how many are in the other?

23

number in the other?

24

I mean, the norm, I thought, was that you raise an

25

ineffective-assistance-counsel claim in the collateral

How many -- what's the

What is the -- what is the number?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

proceeding.
So how many States, actually, does Martinez

3

not apply to?

4

it's, you know, a small number, but I'm pretty certain

5

it isn't every State.

Do you know that?

I -- I doubt that

6

Do we have any idea here?

7

GENERAL KELLER:

At page 33 of our brief, I

8

don't have the precise number, but we do cite various

9

cases that show that Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Ohio,

10

Oklahoma, the Martinez Rule does not apply, because,

11

effectively, what happens there is the proceedings are

12

stayed so that the trial-IAC claim can be raised at that

13

time and not --

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But in -- in most States it

does apply; isn't that right?

16

GENERAL KELLER:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.
Yeah.

Yeah.

And then,

18

General, I think that your brief did the right thing in

19

terms of thinking about Martinez to say why did Martinez

20

make the exception that it did and ask whether those

21

same factors suggest an analogous exception here.

22

think that that's the right way to go about thinking

23

about this question.

24
25

I

So, I mean, it seems to me that your main
theme here is this idea that you did get one shot; is --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

is that -- is that correct?

2

GENERAL KELLER:

3

right to trial counsel --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

GENERAL KELLER:

6

Combined with the unique

Yeah --- and the -- and the --

and the significant --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

GENERAL KELLER:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.
-- systemic costs.
Okay.

So the unique right,

10

I mean, I think we've talked about.

11

counsel, for sure, is the most, most, most important,

12

but appellate counsel is pretty important too.

13

It's -- trial

But just let's think about this you -- you

14

got one shot already.

15

understand it, because it seems to me what Martinez said

16

is, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't get a shot to make your

17

trial -- ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim,

18

your IATC claim, and only if we made the exception that

19

we did would you get a shot to make that trial counsel

20

claim.

21

I guess I'm just not sure I

And here, similarly, only if we do the same

22

thing will you ever get a shot to make a claim that your

23

appellate counsel was deficient.

24

independent, freestanding constitutional right to

25

effective appellate counsel.

And people do have an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

GENERAL KELLER:

But Martinez focused on the

2

fact that there was a particular trial error and a

3

particular type of trial error that was not being able

4

to be raised.

5

based --

And appellate-IAC claims are going to be

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

GENERAL KELLER:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

I think if you read --- on that trial error.
-- Martinez, Martinez

basically does not talk at all about the underlying

10

error.

11

Now, of course, ineffective assistance is important

12

because, you know, it's not just the lawyers there for

13

show, it's -- it's to remedy or prevent some underlying

14

claim.

15

It talks about the ineffective assistance claim.

But the same is true here.

If Martinez was

16

trying to figure out how to ensure the fairness of the

17

trial process, this would be trying to figure out how to

18

ensure, through effective counsel, the fairness of the

19

appellate process.

20

indeed identical --

And it seems to me quite analogous,

21

GENERAL KELLER:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- just on a different

GENERAL KELLER:

But in Martinez, the

23
24
25

But in --

level.

ineffective assistance claim was a trial error.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

litigation necessarily applies --

2
3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But here -- but here it's an

appellate error.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But one thing that's the

5

same is that the State habeas would be the first

6

opportunity to raise this.

7

assistance of appellate counsel on the appeal.

8

obvious.

9

first time you could raise it.

10

You can't raise ineffective
That's

So your -- the -- the State habeas is the

And in considering this question, I'm sure

11

you anticipated this, Justice Scalia, in Martinez, said

12

there's not a dime's worth of difference between an

13

ineffective assistance of trial counsel -- the issue in

14

Martinez -- and those where Petitioner claims his direct

15

appeal counsel was ineffective.

16

Was he wrong in thinking there's not a

17

dime's worth of difference?

18

GENERAL KELLER:

He was wrong in this

19

instance.

20

to maintain a baseline where at least some court had

21

adjudicated the underlying trial error, and even as

22

Martinez itself reaffirmed the general rule of Coleman.

23

And if this Court were to start extending that now to

24

appellate-IAC claims, it would be returning the Court to

25

something akin to Fay v. --

And the reason is because Martinez was trying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2

GENERAL KELLER:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

But, again --- litigation --- General, you're sort

of --

GENERAL KELLER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- at some point.
-- redefining it so that it

7

fits your position.

8

court evaluate the ineffective assistance of trial

9

claim, and this is about having some court evaluate the

10

But Martinez was about having some

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.

11

And is there an underlying thing that we're

12

trying to get at?

13

ineffective assistance of trial counsel to ensure that

14

the trial process was fair.

15

having some court litigate the ineffective assistance of

16

appellate counsel claim in order to ensure that the

17

appellate counsel is fair.

18

analogous.

19

Sure.

In Martinez, it was

GENERAL KELLER:

Here, it's -- it's -- it's

So the two are quite

But under that reasoning,

20

it would be -- the right to counsel necessarily has to

21

end at some point.

22

then show ineffective assistance of State habeas counsel

23

or Federal habeas counsel.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

It could always be that you could

you're exactly right.

It -- it ends, I think --

And I think it ends where the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

Constitution gives out.

2

although the State does not have to set up an appeals

3

process, once it sets up an appeals process, you are

4

entitled to effective counsel in it.

5

where it ends.

6

Because we've said that

GENERAL KELLER:

And so that's

That's right as a

7

constitutional matter.

8

under Coleman and Martinez still apply.

9

federalism and comity, particularly in a situation like

However, State procedural bars
And the cost of

10

this where the State trial court will have necessarily

11

already decided the issue, and upsetting that is going

12

to be precisely what the Court was trying to avoid in

13

Coleman.

14

Coleman is, "This is a case about federalism."

15

indeed this case is too.

16

And that's why when -- the first sentence of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

And

And then there was

17

Martinez.

18

we really went through the three factors that you talk

19

about in your brief:

20

the only shot?

21

something to do with this, or something.

22

third one?

23
24
25

And as you said, in Martinez and in Trevino,

How important is this?

Is this

And, you know, does the State have
Is that the

And, you know, I'm -- I'm suggesting it's
pretty important, and this is your only shot.
GENERAL KELLER:

But the difference is it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

not your only shot because the claim is going to be

2

about an underlying alleged trial error.

3

up the claims for appellate-IAC --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

GENERAL KELLER:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Here, opening

But this claim --- you're going to have --- is not about the

7

underlying trial error.

8

assistance of appellate counsel.

9

that's about ensuring that the appellate process has

10

This claim is about effective
And -- and -- and

integrity and fairness attached to it.

11

GENERAL KELLER:

But, Justice Kagan, at root

12

here, the issue is a supplemental jury instruction which

13

was not preserved, which was correct, and there would

14

have been no prejudice from in any event.

15

the type of case the Court should be worried about.

16

There are going to be these State law objections of

17

something that came up at trial, although this is an odd

18

posture because it was not preserved in fact, but that

19

would be the case the Court would have to be worrying

20

about.

21

And this is

And then we're going to be here twice over

22

that claim being defaulted, arguing about not

23

necessarily whether there was -- did appellate counsel

24

make this decision or that decision.

25

collapse into an underlying review of what happened at

Alderson Reporting Company

It's going to

2

trial on federal habeas, which is something this Court

3

has long avoided, to undo the judgments issued by State

4

courts, particularly when they are doubly defaulted

5

claims that were, in fact, considered by at least one

6

court before.

7

And that's going to apply for all errors at

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, General, that assumes

8

that a -- that some court is going to say, if there was

9

a trial error that we can see out there, then there was

10

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.

11

not correct for many of the reasons that people on -- I

12

mean, that everybody acknowledges.

13

assistance of appellate counsel, it's not because you

14

failed to make an argument about any old trial error;

15

it's going to be a special and rare thing.

16

GENERAL KELLER:

But that's

To have ineffective

And, Justice Kagan,

17

precisely because it's going to be rare, that it's going

18

to be an infinitesimally small number of cases are going

19

to be meritorious, that has to be weighed under

20

Martinez's equitable calculus against the huge systemic

21

cost of opening up the entire trial on Federal habeas

22

review to every little State law objection and

23

evidentiary objection.

24
25

Here, it's jury instructions.

JUSTICE ALITO:
thing?

Why will it be a small

If you can identify looking back that there was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

an objection that should have been granted, and it might

2

have -- might have led to a different result at trial

3

but it wasn't raised on direct appeal, then there's

4

going to be ineffective assistance of -- of appellate

5

counsel.

6
7

GENERAL KELLER:

Exactly, Justice Alito, and

that's why it will collapse.

8

Also, too --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

That's not

10

the test -- that's not the test.

11

have resulted in a -- a difference on appellate review,

12

not at trial.

13

GENERAL KELLER:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The test is, would it

Well -There's -- the appellate

15

review is on the basis of the record as it exists, not

16

on one that should have existed.

17

GENERAL KELLER:

Yes, but it's going to

18

collapse into an analysis of what was the alleged trial

19

error, because that would be what appellate counsel

20

should have been trying to raise in that situation.

21

Also, if I can back out, what we're talking

22

about here is not just success on the merits of the

23

claim.

24

that standard is the would reasonable jurists debate

25

standards that the Court is familiar with from the

would be many.

5

That is not a

And so the number of claims

It's --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you'd have to show,

6

wouldn't you, that -- that the -- any reasonable lawyer

7

would have raised this -- would have won this claim and

8

made a difference -- raised it, won it, and it would

9

have made a difference.

10
11
12

GENERAL KELLER:

You'd have to show that,

but this case -JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but that's not that

13

easy to show, just as it's not that easy to show in a --

14

in the -- in the same situation in the trial.

15
16

GENERAL KELLER:

But that's analyzing

whether the claim would succeed.

As far as --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

No --

18

GENERAL KELLER:

-- on court --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I accept that, and

20

people raise all kinds of things in habeas.

21

they're -- they're -- this is a -- district judges are

22

kept busy with these habeas petitions, I accept that.

23

That's why I'm -- I'll read the empirical -- I -- I'm

24

curious to know just what the situation is empirically.

25

GENERAL KELLER:

You know,

And -- and they're going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

be even busier and it's going to divert their attention

2

from claims that would otherwise be meritorious.

3

Extending an exception like this to an acknowledged set

4

of claims that have an infinitesimally small chance of

5

merit, that is not a good use of judicial resources.

6

That's not why the writ of habeas corpus exists.

7

the equitable judgment inherent in -- in Martinez and

8

various other cases on habeas review have noted that

9

that equity must weigh in, and we would be inundated

10

with all sorts of claims about even State law and --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

The other side has been

12

brought out.

13

where let's suppose the appellate lawyer just really

14

didn't even bring an appeal.

15

and the trial was rife with errors and a serious

16

penalty.

17

whatsoever.

18

see that?

19

are only a few.

20
21
22
23
24
25

I mean, there is the occasional claim

He had a two-page brief

It was attached and -- and no relief
He can't bring that to any court.
That's the other side of it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you

Even if there

Or you could bring it on

State collateral.
GENERAL KELLER:

You absolutely -- you could

bring it as is -JUSTICE BREYER:

He has to have -- he has to

have failed to do that, and -- or at least the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

collateral review has to also have been inadequate.

2

so we have to have a couple of situations where they are

3

both inadequate or you don't even get into the Federal

4

court.

5

is quite -- is very tough and -- but suppose it's met,

6

that's -- that's, of course, what's annoying on the

7

other side.

8

and the trial filled with errors and didn't have decent

9

counsel anywhere and what a mess.

So the standard for winning, which you concede

Here is a person in jail forever or worse,

I mean, shouldn't

10

there be some remedy?

11

why Justice Scalia wrote that there's no way to stop

12

this extension.

And there is none.

And that's

13

GENERAL KELLER:

Well, first of all --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

He wasn't for it.

15

(Laughter.)

16

GENERAL KELLER:

First of all, the

17

miscarriage of justice -- actually in this instance,

18

exception to overcome procedural default -- already

19

exists.

20

innocence that Your Honor would be discussing.

21
22
23

And

And so that would capture any cases of actual

Where -- where does it

exist?

24

The -- you can overcome a procedural default for a

25

miscarriage of justice.

Wholly separate from Martinez.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

And in that situation you could overcome a procedural

2

default using that -- that actual-innocence gateway.

3

Now, as Justice Kennedy noted, though, State

4

habeas would be the place to raise that claim.

5

the claim was adjudicated in trial court, a record was

6

made for appellate counsel and the habeas counsel, and

7

then neither appellate --

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if

Actual innocence means he

was actually innocent.
GENERAL KELLER:

Well -- or actually

innocent of the death penalty.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

13

GENERAL KELLER:

And that would be another

14

way that that type of claim --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Well, that's an

interesting open question.

17

GENERAL KELLER:

18

(Laughter.)

19

GENERAL KELLER:

For a different day.

But the question before the

20

Court today is whether to extend the narrow exception

21

for trial IAC claims when the court has recognized that

22

the trial is the main event; appeals are not central due

23

to determination of innocence or guilt.

24

significant difference between appeals and trials, as

25

the Court has noted in Ross.

There's a

And the costs of opening

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

up the entire Federal trial do not warrant that

2

extension.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, could I just -- I

4

guess I got a little bit confused in your exchange with

5

Justice Alito, because you had been pressing this is

6

just going to be an infinitesimally small --

7

infinitesimally small, I think that that was your

8

phrase.

9

happen all the time, and then you said yes, and then you

10

And Justice Alito said he thought it would

went back to infinitesimally small.

11

So, which is it?

12

GENERAL KELLER:

The answer is, there's

13

going to be an infinitesimally small number of claims

14

that are actually successful, meritorious at the end of

15

the day.

16

to be faced with a wide number of --

17

However, the courts and the States are going

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

Okay.

I thought

18

that his point was different, that it was actually not

19

going to be infinitesimally small.

20

it is going to be pretty rare, as you say.

21

then I think it really is Justice Breyer's question.

22

It's like, okay, it will be rare.

23

is that those rare, good claims, where there really has

24

been a defective appellate process and a violation of

25

the constitutional right to a fair appellate process has

Alderson Reporting Company

But let's say that
You know,

But the alternative

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

been violated, and there's no way to correct for that in

2

the same way that there was no way to correct for the --

3

the trial -- the ineffective trial counsel that we

4

talked about in Martinez and Trevino.

5

GENERAL KELLER:

You'd still have the

6

actual-innocence exception, and also Martinez reaffirmed

7

the general rule of Coleman.

8

bars necessarily will do is bar certain claims that

9

otherwise could have been raised.

And what State procedural

But when a trial

10

court has adjudicated the case and neither appellate nor

11

a habeas counsel have raised it, the universe of cases

12

that we're talking about here combined with the cost on

13

the other side of opening an entire Federal trial up do

14

not warrant that extension.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -It did reaffirm the general

16

rule of Coleman except to the extent that this was your

17

only shot.

18

of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, which is

19

a violation of a constitutional right.

20
21

GENERAL KELLER:

24
25

To raise that particular

claim, but that particular claim --

22
23

And this is your only shot to raise a claim

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's all we're dealing

with here.
GENERAL KELLER:

But it will be predicated

on an underlying trial issue.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

And that's the difference.

The trial IAC

2

claim in Martinez, that was the trial error.

3

the particular trial error the court was concerned

4

about, and that unique bedrock right.

5

That was

Here, in contrast, when the Court has

6

recognized repeatedly that appeals are quite different

7

from trials, and that an appellate IAC claim is

8

necessarily predicated upon an alleged trial error, the

9

Court has adjudicated that alleged trial error.

And

10

separating it out and just saying that the appellate IAC

11

claim itself has not been raised, that has to be seen,

12

though, in the context that the underlying claim has.

13

If there are no further questions, we ask

14

the Court to affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.

If procedural default by State habeas

So what do we about that problem,

incentive for States to stop using collateral review to

MR. KRETZER:

Well, as an initial matter,

18

one would necessarily be perpetrating ineffective

19

assistance on their own by deliberately defaulting a

20

claim from State habeas.

21

there who would deliberately open themself up to a

22

susceptibility of ineffectiveness contention if, for no

23

other reason, you're kicked off the court appointments

Federal court.

The number of Federal courts actually having

10

merits hearings on Strickland claims is incredibly

small.

Federal habeas is designed to prevent and correct severe

malfunctions of the State trial system, that's probably

a very good thing.

strength of the appellate claim that was not raised, I

18

think there's serious pause, because all that Mr. Davila

19

is asking is for the same standard as that which exists

20

in Martinez.

the contention has to be raised in a writ.
