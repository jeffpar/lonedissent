Mr. Pincus.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PINCUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case brings before the Court two

12

questions regarding the patent exhaustion doctrine, also

13

known as the first sale doctrine.

14

Bowman, under that doctrine, the initial authorized sale

15

of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that

16

item.

17

item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any

18

subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as

19

he sees fit.

20

As this Court said in

And by exhausting the patentee's monopoly on that

That principle goes back, of course, to the

21

15th century.

22

restraints on alienations of chattels based on the

23

fundamental insight that you own the goods that you buy,

24

and you should be able to do with them what you wish,

25

and that clouds over Title -- hurt the marketability of

The common law refused to enforce

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

goods and intercommerce, and importantly, in the patent

2

context, allowing these downstream restrictions to be

3

forced would preempt secondary markets with -- which

4

check the patent owner's monopoly power.

5

Let me begin with the first question, which

6

is whether the authorized sale of an article embodying

7

the patent exhausts patent rights with respect to that

8

article, or whether the patentee may impose restrictions

9

enforceable under patent laws, such as on resale, repair

10

or reuse simply by stating such a restriction in the

11

sales agreement.

12

The courts --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry to

14

interrupt you, but that limitation is critical, right?

15

Enforceable under patent law?

16

MR. PINCUS:

Enforceable under patent law.

17

We -- there's no question here.

18

its limitations, would allow the enforcement of -- of

19

those restrictions if they were a valid contract.

20

is all about whether the patent law remedies apply.

21

The contract law, with

This

The courts' description and application of

22

the doctrine for more than 150 years makes clear that

23

such restrictions cannot be enforced under the patent

24

law.

25

A -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there other examples

of really important rules that have not been codified?

2

Why hasn't this been codified?

3

MR. PINCUS:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. PINCUS:

In the Patent Act, Your Honor?
Too busy or what?

Well, I think -- I think

6

that -- that there were a number of -- of -- of patent

7

law rules that Congress didn't codify it fully or either

8

at all in the 1952 Act.

9

the contributory infringement area, for example, has

This was one.

The Court, in

10

looked to pre-1952 law to flesh out the details of

11

contributory infringement that the -- that Congress

12

didn't specify.

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

failure to codify mean we should be somewhat cautious --

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I -- I don't think -Or in -- or in

-- there's a question about

22

extending it.

23

enunciation of the rule in the cases prior to 1952 was

24

very clear and specific.

25

really no doubt that when Congress enacted the law in

I -- I think -- I think the Court's

So I think it was -- there's

Alderson Reporting Company

1

1952, it did so with the knowledge that there was the

2

principle that I've recited, and -- and the Bowman

3

recitation is consistent with -- with many, many

4

decisions of this Court dating back to the 1800s that

5

say the same thing, that when there is an authorized

6

sale, the patent rights are exhausted.

7

in some cases, the -- the article falls out of the

8

patent laws and all that applies is State law.

9

The Court said

And most importantly, the sole -- the

10

Court's sole decision upholding these sort of

11

restrictions, A.B. Dick was expressly overruled a few

12

years later in the motion picture patents case.

13

not only have the Court's consistent enunciation of the

14

doctrine, we have the fact that there was this deviation

15

and then an immediate correction.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

So we

So --

So it's contributory

What other patent ideas were not codified?
MR. PINCUS:

The misuse doctrine, I don't

19

believe, was -- was codified initially, although there

20

have been some subsequent amendments that have done

21

that.

22

years, for example, as the government points out in its

23

brief, between the -- the late 1800s and 1952, there was

24

no infringement; wasn't explicitly referenced in the

25

Patent Act.

Other patent defenses, there were -- there were

But everyone knew that the common law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

rules, the rules that have been developed under prior

2

statutes, continue to apply and that there was a remedy

3

for infringement, and what its contours were were

4

specified by -- by the Court's prior decision.

5

So it's an area where there is a lot of --

6

the work has been done by adopting and incorporating

7

these prior decisions.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

Circuit's rule on this is 25 years old.

10
11

Well, the Fed -- Federal
Has it caused a

lot of problems?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, the Federal Circuit's

12

rule is old, but it's been subject to dispute, both when

13

this Court decided Quanta and then again when the Court

14

decided Bowman.

15

our brief, and some lower courts believed that the rule

16

had been displaced.

17

some of the -- the amicus briefs point out, commentators

18

were skeptical that it could be reconciled with this

19

Court's rule.

20

discussed in the Medical Device Reprocessor's brief, for

21

example, and the Intel brief -- were counseling their

22

clients not to abide by -- not to take action based on

23

this rule because it was quite suspect.

24
25

Most commentators, as we discussed in

Even at the time it was decided, as

So the practice at industry, and this is

problems in this global supply chain --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's certainly a

4

rather risky strategy.

5

patentholders would pursue that.

6

going to get every patent case has adopted a particular

7

rule and then just -- would you advise your client,

8

well, just disregard that?

9

It seems counterintuitive that

MR. PINCUS:

If the court that's

Well, I think what we --

10

what -- what people are advising their clients was don't

11

impose restrictions based on the idea that they can be

12

enforced because there's a good chance that they can't

13

14

imposed; a few were.

15

the situation the Court confronted in Kirtsaeng where

the Court said -- there, there was a 30-year rule that

hadn't been questioned at all by decisions of this

Court.

20

if the law was clarified by this Court.

21

So many restrictions were not being

And I think the -- the disruption that would

22

occur is amply demonstrated in the amicus briefs and

23

would indeed expand patent monopoly rights far beyond

24

anything that ever -- anyone has thought possible under

25

this Court's precedents.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

Let me briefly talk about the -- the lower

2

court's decisions where it went astray.

3

basic justifications.

4

Circuit assumed that the exhaustion doctrine was

5

grounded in the without-authority clause in Section

6

271(a) and that, therefore, Congress had given the

7

patentee a veto over the scope of the exhaustion rule.

8

We think that's not correct.

9

There were two

One was statutory.

The Federal

This Court's prior cases prior to 1952

10

didn't indicate at all that exhaustion was a question of

11

the patentee's authority, rather, a flat rule.

12

Court's exhaustion we think is best looked at in either

13

of two ways; either as a limit on the 152(a) rights, the

14

rights to exclude that are set forth, and what the Court

15

has indicated is that there are a limit on the -- the

16

scope of the patentee's right to exclude.

17

And the

Also, the 1952 Act included in

18

Section 282(b)(1) a section called Defenses that set

19

forth defenses that could be pled.

20

defenses was absent of liability for infringement

21

thereto in obvious incorporation of the preexisting

22

exhaustion doctrine.

23

And one of those

The Federal Circuit's second rationale

24

confused two concepts:

25

the terms for a first sale, and the ability to impose

The ability of a patentee to set

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

post-sale restrictions.

2

just as a patentee can decide for itself who it will

3

sell to, it can impose as a condition of licensing,

4

manufacturing and sales by others those same

5

restrictions.

6

to just as who it can decide to sell to.

7

We think it's quite clear that

It can restrict who the licensee can sell

But in either case, whether the sale by the

8

patentee or the sale by the licensee, post-sale

9

restrictions are invalid as long as it's an authorized

10

sale.

11

authorized.

12

additional inquiry:

13

of the license?

14

and no post-sale restrictions can be enforced.

Any sale by the patentee is, of course,

15

In the licensee context, there's an
Did the licensee abide by the terms

If it did, then the sale is authorized

Let me turn, if I may, to the second

16

question, the question of international exhaustion

17

that -- that this case raises.

18

starting point here is, again, Congress's incorporation

19

of this Court's statements regarding the exhaustion

20

rule.

21

if there were provisions stating the initial authorized

22

sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to

23

that item.

24

that limits exhaustion to sales by U.S. patentees within

25

the United States.

We think that the

In other words, the Patent Act should be read as

There's certainly nothing in the Patent Act

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it's somewhat surprising

2

to me that none of the briefs in this case talk about

3

our cases regarding extraterritoriality.

4

years, we've been -- we have said very -- that a statute

5

does not apply outside the United States unless it says

6

that it applies outside the United States.

7

why that shouldn't be the same for a common-law rule

8

like the rule here.

9

application of U.S. patent law abroad, where is the

In recent

I don't see

And if what's involved here is the

10

clear statement that the exhaustion rule applies outside

11

of the borders of the United States?

12

where that can be found.

13

MR. PINCUS:

I -- I don't see

Your Honor, I don't think this

14

is a question of extraterritorial application

15

anything -- any more than the issue in Kirtsaeng was a

16

question of extraterritorial application of the

17

Copyright Act.

18

The question here is whether the patentee's

19

acts outside the United States have an impact on its

20

ability to enforce its rights within the United States.

21

So that -- no one is saying that the sales outside the

22

United States are governed by the U.S. patent law,

23

they're obviously not, just as the sales outside the

24

United States under the Copyright Act are not governed

25

by the Copyright Act.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

But the question here is whether if there is

2

an authorized sale outside the United States authorized

3

by the U.S. patentee, whether that should have the same

4

exhaustion consequences as a sale within the United

5

States.

6

broad rule that the Court has enunciated dictate that

7

the conclusion here should be, yes, the same exhaustion

8

rule should apply.

9

And we think the rationale of Kirtsaeng and the

In fact, it seems to us that the

10

consequences that the Court pointed to in Kirtsaeng, not

11

only do we have an enunciation of a nongeographic rule

12

and the support of the common-law nongeographic rule

13

that the Court identified in Kirtsaeng, but the adverse

14

consequences that the Court pointed to are even more

15

dramatic here because of the fact that patented articles

16

are often combined into other goods through a global

17

supply chain.

18

And as a number of the briefs talk about,

19

just think about a situation where a phone is assembled

20

in China with patented chips sold from Taiwan, a screen

21

from China, and hundreds of other patented components

22

from all over.

23

consummated outside the United States.

All of the sales of those components

24

The consequence there would that -- would be

25

that if that final phone is sold into the United States,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

all of the sellers, resellers, and users of that phone

2

would be subject to patent infringement liability if the

3

U.S. rights were not expressly licensed -- U.S. rights

4

for sale not expressly licensed for just one patent in

5

that huge conglomeration of patents that were embodied

6

in that object.

7

Same for a car assembled in Canada.

The car

8

example that the Court used in its opinion in Kirtsaeng

9

applies equally here.

An ignition from Germany, a brake

10

system from the United States, everything sold and put

11

together outside the United States, and then the car

12

brought into the United States, a risk of patent

13

liability.

14

And here, the risk is even greater because

15

there's no fair use doctrine to moderate the application

16

of the rule.

17

strict liability offense with no exceptions.

have the additional problem in the patent context of

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Either way, they're suing

11

under American law and this person has violated the

12

patent or he hasn't violated the American patent.

quite right, I think, that Lord Coke and his great

principle of no alienation on chattels is being laughed

at.

side, they have just received money for that first sale

18

under, let's say, a German patent, and they have not

19

received any money on this American patent.

20

say, well, how could you be subjecting us to a rule that

21

that first sale exhausted our right to money under the

22

American patent when we never received any money under

23

the American patent?

24
25

That's your argument.

But on the other

So they

Now -- so there's one thing one way and
there's one important thing the other way.

Alderson Reporting Company

So how do

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

you react?

2

MR. PINCUS:

Well, my reaction is that in --

3

in many of the contexts in which this issue arises, it's

4

really not quite right that the U.S. -- first of all,

5

Justice, to - to be sure we're on the same stage --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. PINCUS:

Uh-huh.

-- these are all sales that are

authorized by the U.S. patentee.

9

day, the U.S. patentee has control over whether --

10

So at the end of the

whether or not --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

All sales were authorized.

12

In the one sale, it was sold in Bavaria under a German

13

patent.

14

but he said, I love it.

15

whenever you use it, you put a big red sign with my name

16

on it.

And not only was it authorized by the American,

All right?

17

And so what I want to you do is

There's a condition.

MR. PINCUS:

And -- and so the -- the -- the

18

question here -- I -- I think what your question goes to

19

is, do sales in foreign countries under different laws

20

allow the U.S. patentee to recoup the value of his

21

patent --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I'm saying do sales

23

under foreign laws in foreign countries -- that's the

24

question -- once there has been such a sale, does the

25

patentee still have the right under his American patent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16

to restrict the use of that widget, that particular

2

widget, bought by the buyer in Bavaria.

3

MR. PINCUS:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

And our submission is no.

no.

6

MR. PINCUS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

I know your submission is

And -- and -- but -- but -And I'm just trying to get

your answer to their argument --

9

MR. PINCUS:

10

But -- but --

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- in saying whatever you

11

think of the U.S., there's a big difference here.

12

haven't gotten any money back on their --

13

MR. PINCUS:

They

And -- and that's why I -- I --

14

I was talking about there, whether or not they had

15

gotten -- the argument on the other side I think is we

16

haven't gotten the value we would get if we sold our

17

product into the U.S.

18

to that.

19

So there are a couple of answers

First of all, in the global supply chain

20

context, which is where most of these situations arise,

21

the fact is the sales may take place of the components

22

in a particular country, but they're part of a huge

23

supply chain that's flowing to produce finished goods

24

that are then going to be distributed to a large number

25

of companies.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17

Companies that sell -- that either license

2

their patents or sell components into that supply chain

3

know full well that this is a global chain and that

4

they -- they are not getting value that's country

5

specific.

6

the average of the value in all the places where the

7

patent is going to be used, because that's what they

8

should demand because that's, in fact, the market into

9

which they are selling.

10

They are getting a value that is essentially

The end-use product is a different

11

situation.

12

books in -- in Kirtsaeng, that are being sold into a

13

particular market, and I think there are a couple of

14

answers to that.

15

There certainly are products, just as the

One is, A, there are nonpatent constraints,

16

packaging, labeling, contract requirements that may

17

ameliorate the ability of those products to be

18

transshipped into the United States.

19

B, there are lots of different things that

20

go into whether or not someone gets -- how much value

21

one gets in the copyright context, for example.

22

Although the legal rules may be more even, the

23

enforcement of copyright vary -- principle varies

24

dramatically in different markets, as does the wealth in

25

different markets, and that affects how things can be

2

And lastly, as the Court pointed out, so I

3

think there are constraints that protect the U.S.

4

patentee in -- in being able to demand the value

5

attributable to the U.S. patent.

6

Court said in Kirtsaeng, price discrimination may not

7

necessarily be something that's guaranteed under the

8

patent laws --

12

Sorry, Justice.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I've -- I've heard --

14

I've read and reread that argument, that the

15

patentholder is not receiving value for its German

18

the first-sale doctrine, in my mind, is that the value

19

is whatever you get for that product.

20

have a U.S. patent or a German patent or a whatever

21

patent, you're still getting value for that idea, for

22

that discovery, for that whatever creative moment that

23

you have that results in this final product.

decide it's not worth my while to sell my product in

6

Germany if the risk of transshipment outweighs the

7

benefit.

That's an economic --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. PINCUS:

10

Now, I will say --

-- calculation for the

patentee.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that -- that there are

12

counter arguments on policy questions here of -- on both

13

sides.

14

and its consequences.

15
16

I mean, there are serious issues about this rule

How do you address all the negative
consequences that your rule appears to be creating?

17

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think the principal

18

negative consequence that -- that -- that my friends on

19

the other side and their amici point to is this question

20

of price discrimination, and I think we've talked about

21

that.

22

Another issue that's raised in some of the

23

briefs is safety:

24

devices.

25

has full authority to prevent imports under 21 U.S.C.

Food, drug -- drugs, and medical

2

drugs.

3

in the safety areas.

So broad authority where there are those risks

4

Another argument that's made on the other

5

side is that there will be a disruption of settled

6

expectations for the reasons -- I don't think they're --

7

that those expectations are -- are legitimate.

8

they are -- because I don't think the rule has been

9

settled under national exhaustion, but this Court --

But if

10

unless this Court is going to not be able to overturn

11

decisions of the Federal Circuit, the fact that the

12

Federal Circuit has decided something can't be

13

sufficient to tie this Court's hands in doing that.

14

If you look it the Alice case, for example,

15

that obviously had tremendous implications for both the

16

patentees and for people who had entered into license

17

agreements and were paying money for patents that turned

18

out to be invalid.

19

this Court getting the law right.

But that was just a consequence of

20

So I -- I don't think on the policy level

21

there's a lot on their side, and I think Congress can

22

address those issues if -- if there are specific

23

problems.

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

4

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

5

SUPPORTING REVERSAL IN PART AND VACATUR IN PART

6
7

MR. STEWART:
please the Court:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I'd like to address the domestic exhaustion
issue first, and I'd like to begin by responding to

10

Justice Kennedy's question about why hasn't the

11

exhaustion doctrine been codified.

12

The Court's historic cases in the domestic

13

exhaustion field have located the exhaustion principle

14

in the language of the predecessors of what is now 35

15

U.S.C. 154(a)(1).

16

Act that says the patent owner has the right to exclude

17

others from making, using, selling, offering for sale,

18

or importing the patented invention.

19

predecessor versions of that language, this Court said

20

those exclusive rights in essence don't encompass the

21

right to control resale or use of a lawfully sold

22

article.

23

That is the provision of the Patent

And in addressing

For example, in Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell,

24

the Court said -- addressed the proper interpretation of

25

the exclusive right to vend, and it said the right to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

vend was exercised when the first authorized sale was

2

made.

3

set resale prices.

4

The right to vend does not encompass the right to

In motion picture patents, the Court said

5

that its task was to determine the meaning of Congress

6

enacting the predecessor version of 154(a)(1).

7

In -- in order -- other cases, the Court has

8

referred to lawfully sold articles as being no longer

9

under the protection of the act of Congress, or that the

10

exhaustion rule delimits the scope of the patent grant.

11

So it's true that the Patent Act doesn't contain an

12

analogue to 17 U.S.C. 109(a), which is the Copyright Act

13

provision that specifically addresses the scope of

14

exhaustion, but the exhaustion doctrine has historically

15

been understood by this Court as a gloss on the

16

exclusive rights conferred by 154(a)(1) and its

17

predecessors, and unless Congress wanted to change the

18

exhaustion rule, either to get -- get rid of it entirely

19

or to substitute some different triggering event, there

20

was no need for it to amend -- to -- to codify an

21

explicit exhaustion provision by continuing in effect

22

and by tweaking the exclusive rights conferred by the

23

grant of a patent, Congress should be understood to have

24

manifested its intention that historic conceptions of

25

domestic -- domestic exhaustion would continue to have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

sway.

2

Now, the second point I make about domestic

3

exhaustion is that the court of appeals' err, in our

4

view, stem to a large extent from its misreading of

5

general talking pictures.

6

dealt not with a -- not with simply a restriction on the

7

use that purchasers could make after an article had been

8

lawfully sold.

9

its patentee's licensee could sell the article in the

General talking pictures

It dealt with the conditions on which

10

first place.

11

also -- often referred to colloquially as the first-sale

12

doctrine, and I think that's a reason -- there's a

13

reason for that.

14

exhaustion turns on whether there has been a lawful

15

first sale, and if the licensee departs from the

16

instruction of the patentee and sells the article in a

17

way that is not authorized, there's no lawful first

18

sale, and therefore, no patent exhaustion.

19

article has been lawfully sold, any restrictions on

20

resale or use that the patentee purports to impose

21

downstream can be enforceable only under contract law or

22

commercial law, not under patent law.

23

And the -- the exhaustion doctrine is

It's that the presence or absence of

But once the

And that brings me to my third point about

24

domestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on

25

the other side is -- on the Respondent's side is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

application of domestic exhaustion principles here would

2

prevent parties from reaching agreements that might be

3

economically advantageous to both of them.

4

And so the Respondent says, well, if I have

5

had particular buyer who only wants to use the cartridge

6

once and doesn't want to pay extra for the privilege of

7

reusing it, if he never intends to do that, why

8

shouldn't we be able to negotiate a deal under which I

9

charge him less in return for his commitment to only use

10

it once?

11

doctrine prevents parties from reaching those agreements

12

and enforcing them as a matter of contract law, if they

13

are enforceable under the -- the law of the relevant

14

jurisdiction.

15

And the answer is nothing in the exhaustion

The policy judgment that this Court has

16

historically attributed to Congress is not a judgment

17

that these sorts of restrictions are bad or should be

18

unenforceable.

19

of a patent doesn't give the patentee any greater rights

20

to make or enforce restrictions like this than a seller

21

of similar unpatented property would have under the

22

rules of -- of general contract law.

23

It's simply a judgment that possession

And so, in several of the exhaustion

24

decisions, the Court has distinguished between the

25

limits on patent remedies and the alternative remedies

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

that might be available under what the Court has often

2

referred to as the general law, the body of contract and

3

commercial law that applies to -- to all sellers.

4

I'd like to turn now, if I may, to the

5

question of international exhaustion.

6

of the United States on -- on this issue is between that

7

of the two parties, it's our view that a patent -- a

8

U.S. patent owner who sells goods -- patented goods

9

abroad should be able to reserve its U.S. rights but

10

need -- needs to do so expressly.

11

And I'd like to start --

12

13

Can -- can they put a

sticker on -- on the -- on the products --

14

MR. STEWART:

This

would be a great boom to the sticker business, right?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. STEWART:

I -- I do want to be careful

19

to -- to -- to limit the -- to make clear the limits on

20

the principle that we're advocating; that is, we're not

21

advocating a rule under which simply by manufacturing

22

and selling overseas, the patentee could impose

23

continuing downstream restrictions on the use of the

24

good once it has been legally imported and sold into the

25

United States.

That is, under our view, if -- if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

Lexmark had said, we'll sell you these cartridges in

2

Canada and you are authorized to import them into the

3

United States and sell them in the United States, but

4

they are still for one use only and you need to put

5

labeling on the package warning your consumers "one use

6

only," in our view, that restriction would be no good

7

because there would be authorized importation into the

8

United States, authorized sale in the United States.

9

And at that point, the Court's domestic exhaustion cases

10

would kick in.

11

view of international exhaustion, is all or nothing.

can say I don't consent to importation into the --

we're talking about is a sticker that warns -- if the

2

product is sold in Germany and the patentee wants to

matter of --

JUSTICE BREYER:
answer is yes.

Every widget has to have a sticker.

MR. STEWART:

No.

The answer is, as a

10

matter of U.S. law, the legality of the import -- the

11

original act of importation will be governed, on our

12

view, by whether the patentee has explicitly reserved

13

its right to -- with the --

MR. STEWART:

Well, the -- the initial buyer

from the U.S. patentee would enter into a contract with

the U.S. patentee, and presumably --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that -- and you agree

11

you're for that, but that is very much contrary to what

12

300 years of restraints on alienation had in mind.

13

One of the problems was that people who buy

14

these things, namely, those who go into grocery store or

15

whatever, don't know that they can't bring it back to

16

the U.S., or they don't know that they can't do this or

they can't do that or have to have the red sign or

it.

20

And you don't have an answer to that, I take

MR. STEWART:

Well, if you wanted -- first,

21

at a certain level, anyone who buys patented products

takes the chance that the person who sold those to him

the Federal Circuit properly looked to the statute to

2

find the origins and limits on the exhaustion doctrine.

3

The Patent Act defines how patent rights can

be acquired, what they cover, and how they are

5

infringed.

6

that infringement occurs when someone makes, sells,

7

uses, offers to sell, or imports into this country an --

8

a patented article without authority from the patent

9

owner.

10

And as to infringement, the statute provides

Now there's been a lot of talk about

11

authorized sales exhausting patent rights, but -- but

12

you have to ask yourself, an authorized sale of what?

13

When a patentee sells a product without saying anything

14

about it, normally the -- the normal understanding is,

15

well, you're selling everything you have.

prominent ways are, of course, licenses and sales.

In the -- in the -- the microchip example,

the -- the logical or the economically rational outcome,

reasons that it's hard to get away with that is the

Official - Subject to Final Review

is because Lord Coke said 300 years ago, you know,

time.

Well, let me -- let me comment

8

on that, because it's certainly true that that's what

9

Lord Coke said in the 17th century, but there are a

10

couple of points I'd like to make about that.

11

One is what Lord Coke said in the quote

12

that's in the Kirtsaeng opinion, for example, is that

13

when someone sells his whole interest, he can impose no

14

restraints because his whole interest is out of him.

15

What we're talking about here is not selling your whole

16

interest.

of course.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. TRELA:

25

If you want to

What we're talking about here,

of course, is not selling the whole interest.

Alderson Reporting Company

The whole

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

interest in a patented article is both the -- the title,

2

so to speak, to the physical material, and the bundle of

3

rights that go with it.

4

The other thing I would say on the Lord Coke

5

issue and the 300 years of common law, Justice Breyer,

6

is that the common law changed a lot after Lord Coke.

7

In Kirtsaeng, the important issue was, was there a

8

geographic restraint that Congress should be assumed to

9

have adopted or -- or have rejected, and they'd be --

10

the common law in the -- in the 17th century was fine

11

for that purpose.

12

But as Judge Taranto's opinion for the

13

Federal Circuit points out, as a number of the amici

14

point out, common law evolved quite a bit after the

15

17th century, both in this country and in England, in

16

particular with respect to restraints on -- on

17

alienation of chattel, both patented and nonpatented.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

There -- there -- there are

19

quite -- I mean, I agree that there are all kinds of

20

exceptions.

21

But to go back to your basic point

22

underlying this, of course, any monopolist, including a

23

patent monopolist, would love to be able to go to each

24

buyer separately and extract from each buyer and user

25

the maximum amount he would pay for that particular

Dentists would pay more for gold perhaps than

They'd like that.

All right.

But by and large, that's

Now, it's against that

8

background that I think the law and economics

professors, who are telling what is correct, that -- and

10

the argument that you're making has to be evaluated.

11

That's what I think on the first part.

2

home market, that's an authorized sale.

3

if some -- if that person or somebody further down uses

4

it in the commercial market, that's -- that's not a

5

problem.

And then if --

But the question is -- and now -- and -- and

this goes back now to Mitchell, Mitchell said nobody can

That's why in Mitchell the

11

period, because it's not a right that he had.

12

is true of the licensee in the General Talking Pictures

13

scenario.

14

The same

He could -- he could convey the right -- he

15

could basically convey authority to use it in the home

16

market, and that's what the patentee was compensated for

17

in that sale, but he could not convey a right he didn't

18

have, which is to use it in the commercial market.

19

that -- and that right was retained by the patentee.

20

was not compensated for it.

21

because there was an authorized sale, there's no

22

infringement.

ask, an authorized sale of what?

respect to that particular article.
Now, the -- there's a concern -- and -- and,

3

Justice Breyer, you expressed it, I think other members

4

of the Court have expressed it, about sort of the -- the

5

unwitting consumer who doesn't know that they're --

6

they're buying a -- a product that, you know, that --

7

well, perhaps some of this authority was withheld.

8

That's really -- that has actually nothing to do with

9

exhaustion doctrine one way or the other.

That is --

10

and I think Mr. Stewart made the point -- that's really

11

a consequence of strict liability for patent

12

infringement.

13

Anytime anyone buys a product, when you buy

14

a -- you buy a Samsung smartphone, to take a recent

15

example, you know, you are -- you are assuming maybe, to

16

the extent anybody outside of this room actually thinks

17

about whether patent rights might or might not apply to

18

an article, maybe you're assuming that it -- to the

19

extent there are patents, nobody -- you know, everybody

20

has authority to do what they are doing, but it's only

21

an assumption.

22

you are not infringing a patent.

23

most consumers don't care, because those claims are not

brought against consumers.

3

So -- and that's particularly true here,

because here, somebody who gets a cartridge from

5

6

Impression, has no reason to think it started with

7

Lexmark.

And it's -- it's -- I think really sums it

It said that U.S. patentee is entitled to one

And that's really been the premise of

The notion is that the authorized sale of a

9

patented article, putting to one side what authorized

10

sale means, lifts the legal restraints that otherwise

11

would limit what the owner of the article could do with

it, causing the article to no longer be within the

bounds of the patent monopoly, a phrase that we hear

the buyer could do, because the U.S. patent has no force

wasn't in it to begin with, again, because the U.S.

The sale doesn't lift any

Sotomayor, you asked about why isn't the patentee

receiving his reward -- that's why, because there are

3

two -- if you're assuming patents in the two countries,

4

first of all, they may or may not cover exactly the same

5

thing.

6

But there are two bundles of rights, and the patentee is

because under -- under the government's rule, of course,

3

you -- you'd have to have an express reservation, so

4

you've got to figure out whether there was an express

reservation.

Under Impression's rule, everything hinges

on an authorized first sale somewhere of each and every

I don't think that that is the real problem.

16

you know, I buy an Apple iPhone from an Apple Store.

17

What I know is, well, Apple is not going to sue me for

infringing Apple's patents, and because I trust Apple, I

trust that they've gotten authority from the thousands

20

of other folks, but -- but it's only an assumption.

21

so -- so you may have -- you may have some peace of

mind, but to truly have certainty, you've got to do

that actually brings up another point, and this is a

point the government made, and this applies both to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the point

2

raised by your adversaries that having different rules

3

with respect to copyright and patents will make -- will

4

complicate the checking because many products have both

5

copyright and patent.

6

MR. TRELA:

There -- there is -- there's no

7

question that there are different -- there -- there are

8

a host of different rules for copyright and patent.

9

And -- and one point I would start with, Justice

10

Sotomayor, is that the -- the scope of copyright

11

protection -- although the remedies may vary from

12

country to country -- the scope of the protection is

13

virtually identical to -- on -- in all the countries of

14

the Berne Convention, which is virtually all of them.

15

That is if -- you -- you don't have to guess about what

16

is or is not subject to the copyright.

17

You know.

Patent protection is very different.

There

18

are inventions -- software inventions, for example,

19

can't be patented in some countries, they can in others.

20

The -- the scope of patent protection is very different

21

from country to country.

22

a -- a host of differences.

23

So the -- there are already

The duration, you know, copyright duration

24

is -- well, I think it's 70 years plus the -- the --

25

after the death of the author, for example.

Alderson Reporting Company

Patent

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

protection, of course, is much more limited in time.

2

It's also easier to identify because you have

3

examination requirements, the -- you know, registration

4

requirements.

5

copyright.

6

differences.

7

You don't have any of that with

So there already are -- are a host of -- of

And in the marketplace, they -- they're

8

dealt with in the same way.

9

on both sides here, particularly the -- the ones with

What we know from the amici

10

the global supply chains, Intel and SanDisk on the

11

Impression side, IBM and Qualcomm on the -- on our side,

12

they do -- they get global licenses to protect their --

13

themselves, their -- their counterparties, consumers,

14

that's the way it's done.

15

copyright, it's done that way for patent, and -- and I

16

think IBM made this point particularly clear in -- with

17

respect to the international area, Qualcomm addressed

18

both international and domestic, you would be upsetting

19

settled expectations, particularly in the international

20

area, if you adopt either Impression's rule of automatic

21

mandatory exhaustion that you can't even contract out

22

of, or the government's rule that has the express

23

exhaustion requirement.

24

it -- there are hundreds of thousands of contracts that

25

have been entered into based on the Federal Circuit's

It's done that way for

Because -- I think IBM put

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

ruling in JS Photo, which was -- which was unquestioned

2

since 2001, and -- and even Intel and SanDisk say yes,

3

we -- our -- our contracts reflect this.

4

So I think that this is a particular area to

5

move cautiously because what you're talking about here

6

are, you know, international trade matters where the

7

Impression rule would essentially put the United

8

States -- basically, the United States would be saying

9

unilaterally, blanket international exhaustion is great.

10

Let's do it.

11

Apparently, we don't because we're just willing to do it

12

because we're good guys.

13

international trade issues like that should be decided.

14

Do we care if other countries reciprocate?

That's not the way

On the domestic side, Qualcomm and others

15

make the case that, in fact, parties have been relying

16

on this.

17

and Pharma briefs, they point out that they rely on this

18

in terms of providing research quantities of new

19

compounds to universities and others.

20

is -- there can be a difference between the human and

21

veterinary markets for certain compounds, and allowing

22

conditional sales and conditional licenses to -- to be

23

enforceable via patent law facilitates that sort of

24

dispersion of the technology which in turn fosters

25

innovation beyond that first level of innovation.

The -- in the -- the biopharmaceutical and --

Alderson Reporting Company

There -- there

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

So I think the -- this notion that nobody

2

was -- was doing these sorts of things because they

3

weren't sure this was the law, it -- it's -- it's not

4

factually true.

5

also as a matter of common sense, you -- you really -- I

6

think if you're a -- a patent owner and you really want

7

to exploit your invention and you've got Federal Circuit

8

precedence saying you can do it, the fact that

9

somebody -- the -- the fact that maybe later down the

We -- we know that from the amici.

And

10

road, even if you thought there was some doubt, that

11

later down the road that this Court might say well, no,

12

you can't do that, it -- that's not going to dissuade

13

you from doing it because it's not going to make it

14

illegal.

15

would work and it didn't work.

16

nobody was doing this because of uncertainty about

17

the -- the Federal Circuit precedent in this area, I

18

think, is implausible.

19

It's just going to say, well, we thought it
So this notion that

Now, let me talk a little bit more about the

20

government's position on express reservations of U.S.

21

patent rights in the -- in the foreign area.

22

Now, besides disruption of settled

23

expectations, what that would do is it would basically

24

insert U.S. patent law into every transaction involving

25

any sort of product that might be covered by U.S. patent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

rights.

2

Under that express reservation rule, if BMW,

3

a German company that has U.S. patents, wants to sell a

4

load of cars to a distributor in Slovakia, well, they

5

need to negotiate about and include in that contract,

6

apparently, a reservation of U.S. rights, because

7

otherwise, if those cars somehow make their way into the

8

U.S., they are unprotected.

9

one car to a buyer in Munich, they presumably would have

Even if they wanted to sell

10

to do that, because otherwise they would be exposed if

11

that car makes its way to the U.S.

12

So that doesn't -- there's no reason why

13

U.S. patent law or U.S. patent rights should even enter

14

into the thinking of parties who are entering into

15

arrangements overseas with -- with no intention or

16

expectation that they are going to find their way to the

17

U.S.

18

enforceability of U.S. patent rights dependent on --

19

really, on the whims of foreign governments and on the

20

details of foreign law.

And that approach would also make the

21

If the reservation of rights is a -- a term

22

of a foreign agreement, then I think that's -- that's

23

where Mr. Stewart ended up, Justice Breyer, in response

24

to your questions.

25

foreign law.

Well, it's going to be governed by

And for all we know, it may or may not be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

enforceable as a matter of a law in that particular

2

foreign country.

3

And we know that certain countries, and

4

India is an example that's been given, will do things

5

like impose mandatory licensing requirements on

6

patent -- foreign patent owners, or require that foreign

7

companies partner with local companies.

8

express reservation requirement is announced, there's

9

every reason to think other countries may take steps

10

that -- that undermine or make it very difficult for

11

U.S. patentees to in fact protect their rights in this

12

country.

13

If -- if a new

So the -- and, as I think some of the amici

14

point out, if you announce such a rule, sophisticated

15

U.S. companies, to the extent they can, consistent

16

with -- with foreign law, will -- will reflexively

17

probably include it in their contracts, leaving only

18

unsophisticated smaller U.S. companies exposed, the ones

19

that perhaps don't have expensive lawyers and detailed

20

global sales operations.

21

Let me finally turn to the -- return to the

22

question of why contract remedies aren't -- aren't

23

suitable or aren't adequate.

24

And let me say, first of all, that in a

25

couple of this Court's cases -- and it goes back to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

51

Keeler and Hobby in the 19th century, and then picked up

2

in some other cases -- those -- the Court makes the

3

comment, after finding that a particular sale was

4

unrestricted, Court says:

5

to protect its distributors -- because these -- those

6

cases involved exclusive geographic distributors -- they

7

could have done so by special contract, but not as a

8

matter of the inherent meaning and effect of the patent

9

laws, or words to that effect.

10

If -- if the patentee wanted

Now as Judge Taranto explained, the point

11

there was not that you could only do it by contract, and

12

if you did it, you would have only a contract remedy.

13

The point was that patent rights are conveyed by means

14

of contract.

15

contract is breached, it's only a contract remedy.

16

license agreement is a contract that conveys U.S. patent

17

rights.

18

Talking Pictures and other cases, a violation of a

19

license term, a contract term does give rise to an

20

infringement remedy.

21

And that doesn't mean that if that
A

And as this Court held in Mitchell and General

don't think that's what the Court meant in those

passages.

Now, the -- the -- besides the privity

problem with the contract remedy, you also can't get an

when you're dealing with large scale infringers, like

points.

MR. PINCUS:

The Hobby case.

In those -- in those cases.

Exactly, Your Honor.

14

And in fact, in -- in the Strauss case, the

16

these kinds of restrictions because they have been

17

obnoxious from Lord Coke's day to our -- to our own.

18

I wanted to talk about this -- this question

19

of the -- the risk to the downstream resellers and

20

buyers, because it's true, in patent law there always is

21

some risk that the initial sale won't be authorized.

22

But I think the difference between the two positions

23

here is once there is an initial authorized sale, that's

24

the end of the inquiry under the test that -- that we

25

propose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

54
1

Under my friend's test, even if there is an

2

authorized sale, if there are these other restrictions,

3

they continue to flow down, and therefore, the -- the

4

group of downstream users and buyers who are subject to

5

risk becomes much, much greater.

6

On -- on the question of -- of patent and

copyright, I think the critical point here is not that

8

the laws differ from place to place, but with respect to

have the same rule apply for authorized -- sales

patent and copyright, because then there would be

13

certainty that once there was an authorized sale, both

14

15

I think that's the -- with respect to -- to U.S. rights,

16

and I think that's -- that's the critical point there.

17

18

19

Lexmark is a -- is a well known company that has brand

20

issues to contend with in terms of the suits it might

21

22

23

24

25

Alderson Reporting Company

have been brought recently by those entities against

2

downstream resellers and users under just this kind of

3

we're worried about.

And that's -- that's the evil that -- that

5

If the Court has no further questions.
