ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY GASTON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GASTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

At issue in this case is whether The Hague

11

Service Convention permits service of process by mail if

12

the State of destination does not object.

13

is that such mail service is allowed, and it's a

14

three-part argument.

15

Our position

First, purely textual evidence of meaning

16

shows that this reading of the treaty is at least

17

reasonable.

18

Second, some additional considerations,

19

namely, this Court's decision in Schlunk, as well as the

20

history of events leading up to the treaty, further

21

confirm that this is a reasonable reading of

22

Article 10(a).

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, your adversary

24

basically starts from the proposition that this text is

25

unambiguous.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. GASTON:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Yes.
Do you agree with that

proposition?

4

MR. GASTON:

No.

We do not agree the text

5

is wholly unambiguous.

6

very ambiguous.

7

where (a) uses the word "send," (b) and (c) use the word

8

"effect service."

9

small area, one says, well, wait, what does "send" mean

We believe the text begins as

Looking at Article 10(a), (b), and (c),

And instantly, just looking at that

10

here?

11

Send for both purposes?

12

than to effect serve?

Does it mean send to serve?

Send for nonservice?

Is it the same or different

13

And we have a presumption that has been used

14

in the statutory context the different words are usually

15

going to mean different things.

16

presumption, but even that presumption leaves ambiguity

17

because it --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not a irrebuttable

All right.

So why do

19

you think the drafters used those two different phrases?

20

What's your best answer?

21

MR. GASTON:

The -- -- the -- the best --

22

there's a practical answer and then there's a -- a legal

23

answer.

24

The practical answer -- and this involves

25

the circumstances leading up to the treaty -- is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

there were three prior treaties dating back to 1896,

2

where a French term "addressee" was used in the

3

analogous provision, and that, in French, was also not a

4

term of art for "service."

5

There were two other French terms of art for

6

"service," and the convention used "nova casiam" and

7

"signif casiam" as terms for service.

8

section, which was 6(1) of the earlier treaties, at

9

least of the 1954 treaty, it used the term "addressee."

And then in this

10

And in context, it was very clear that it meant

11

"service" because there were other references to

12

"service" later in that section, and it was understood

13

to mean "service" because the term in French was broad

14

enough to cover "service."

15

And what happened in 1964, during the

16

drafting of the treaty adopted in 1965, they had to

17

prepare, for the first time, an English version of the

18

treaty.

19

English, and, as a practical matter, what they did is

20

they took that language and simplified the article to

21

which it would be part of, and it lost some of its

22

context.

23

Because they would have two texts, French and

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it -- is it fair to say

24

that your first argument, you were talking about the

25

first argument text, but then it seems to me that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

went a little bit beyond text.

2

Is one of your arguments that maybe "send"

3

is ambiguous when you look at (a), but when you look at

4

(b) and (c), you know why they used the word "send" and

5

so it's not ambiguous -- even though it's ambiguous, the

6

much better interpretation is your interpretation, just

7

by looking at (a), (b), and (c)?

8
9
10

Is that your argument?

Is that your first

argument?
MR. GASTON:

No.

The first argument is that

11

all -- there -- there is quite a bit of textual evidence

12

beyond (a), (b), and (c) that suggests "send" in

13

Article 10(a) means "serve" --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. GASTON:

Right.

-- despite a presumption that

16

different words usually mean different things.

17

and that first happens as you draw outward from (a),

18

(b), and (c) to Article 10 as a whole, which has a right

19

of objection by a State of destination.

20

And --

So states that are party to the treaty can

21

object to Article 10(a) or 10(b) or 10(c).

22

means "send" for nonservice purposes, it's basically

23

saying, okay, you can send these judicial documents for

24

unofficial, nonlegal, nonbinding purposes, unless the

25

State of destination objects.

Alderson Reporting Company

And if 10(a)

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's a body of law, a

2

body of international law regarding the way in which

3

treaties should be interpreted, and there are certain

4

rules about the interpretation of treaties.

5

treaties are also the law of the United States.

6

question that you started out answering is a rule for

7

interpreting laws of the United States.

8
9

But
So the

So what do we do in a situation where there
might be a conflict between these two bodies of

10

interpretive standards?

11

MR. GASTON:

And -- and I think, luckily,

12

this case I don't think rings up the conflict, because

13

the only way you remove the ambiguity in a -- in a way

14

against Petitioner's position is to take a canon that

15

words usually mean different things and make it

16

irrebuttable, and that's -- that's not the law under --

17

under Federal law.

18

that canon in some situations.

19

This Court has -- has not applied

And here, you -- you get to a greater

20

meaning by -- and if I could carry out the answer to

21

the -- the State of destination objecting -- it would be

22

very odd to put in a treaty about service, some

23

provision that -- to allow states to object to the use

24

of their mails for unofficial purposes.

25

It -- it really -- I think most people would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

say:

2

unofficial purposes; after the treaty, I ought to be

3

able to use the mail for unofficial purposes.

Well, before the treaty I could use the mail for

4

And even the -- the delegates of members who

5

have met in the years after the treaty have said:

6

even if a State objects or not, you can certainly use

7

the mail for -- for unofficial purposes because that

8

doesn't affect any sovereign interest of the State.

9

They don't have a -- a need to object.

10

Yes,

That structural argument, which is part of

11

Federal law looking at the structure of treaties, is

12

enough, I would -- I would say, by itself to drastically

13

reduce the ambiguity here.

14

nearly textually vanishes when you think about the

15

entire treaty as a whole, which is it's a treaty on

16

service.

17

And then any remaining

The title is the Convention on the Service

18

Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents.

19

preamble discusses simplifying service, expediting

20

service, making service more reliable.

The

21

And in -- in that context, I think the best

22

that -- that -- that Respondent can get to is the idea,

23

well, maybe there's still some remaining ambiguity,

24

because it certainly seems that -- that send here is

25

a -- a rule of service.

And we have domestic examples

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where rules of service, after they've made clear we're

2

talking about service, they use common verbs of

3

transmission:

4

effect service by mailing and so the verb is -- is

5

"mail."

6

Article 10(a), although this is -- is a legal argument,

7

this is not practically what happened, but -- but send

8

is a -- is a perfect word for the directness of the

9

transmission.

Send, deliver, mail.

In Texas, you can

In -- in that context, the word "send" in

10

Every other transmission in the treaty

11

requires some sort of intermediary, whether it's a

12

central authority, a consulate or a diplomatic

13

individual or channel or a judicial officer in -- in the

14

State of destination.

15

through the mail, serving documents, you send them, and

16

it's the only case where you can directly effectuate

17

service.

18

When you're talking about sending

The -- the other of -- in terms of -- in

19

terms of text still, the context of certain other words

20

also shows that send is used and meant as service.

21

There are three channels, other than the central

22

authority, that are mentioned in the treaty:

23

channels, postal channels and consular channels.

24

three use the word "channels."

25

and 10.

And that's in Articles 9

Alderson Reporting Company

And then later, in Article 11, it talks about channels

of transmission.

speaks of more generally methods of transmission.

think these are also contextual evidence that all the

5

channels that have been discussed are service channels.

And then, finally, the -- if -- if there is

7

any ambiguity remaining, the extrinsic evidence that

this Court has said we can consider, at least absent

wholly unambiguous text, is overwhelmingly in support of

the idea that, in fact, at the time of drafting, the --

the drafters and those who adopted it at that convention

intended to allow service by mail.

I have counted --

ratified the treaty, nearly half, 30, have expressed

19

their objection to -- to mail by lodging a declaration

20

say, well, yes, mail is okay, but if you do it this

Or if she suffered a default judgment, is

MR. GASTON:

In -- in general, that is not

it because the convention has two provisions in Articles

14

15 and 16 that enable a person to -- to potentially void

15

a judgment or to extend the time to appeal if certain

16

conditions are shown.

17

in a enforcement proceeding, for example, in Canada, if

18

the judgment were sought to be enforced, if I were on

19

the other side, I would be trying to argue Articles 15

20

and 16 and try and -- and try and show there was a

problem with the judgment.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where does the person

12

get to raise the defense that they didn't actually

receive notice?

14

MR. GASTON:

They can certainly raise it in

15

the -- in the proceeding where the judgment was entered

16

within a reasonable time after they got actual notice of

17

the judgment.

18

have to show they didn't have notice, they have to show

19

they had a prima facie defense, and then they could get

20

relief from the finality of it.

21
22

And that's Article 16 specifically.

And if the Court has no further questions, I
would reserve the remainder of my time.

FOR UNITED STATES, AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Article 10(a) of the Hague Service

6

Convention permits service through postal channels on

7

persons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that's

8

the State where the case is pending -- authorizes such

9

service and if the receiving State where the mail will

10
11

be delivered hasn't objected to Article 10(a).
And I'd like to start with this permit

12

authorize framework, because I think there's been a lot

13

of confusion in the lower courts on this subject.

14

question presented here is perhaps phrased a little

15

inartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be

16

really helpful if this Court would clarify this point.

17

Article 10(a) says that provided the State

18

of destination does not object, the present convention

19

shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial

20

documents by postal channels to persons abroad.

21

is not interfering with freedom.

22

same thing as providing an affirmative authorization for

23

service by mail.

24

be found elsewhere.

25

in the law of the forum State.

The

So it

It is -- it's not the

That affirmative authorization has to
And the place where you find it is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

So, for instance, in our Federal system, if

2

you look at Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure,

3

there is a subsection of Rule 4 that says where an

4

international agreement permits, but does not authorize

5

service on persons abroad, here are a bunch of things

6

you can do.

7

by mail, using registered mail by -- sent by the clerk

8

of the court, service by mail if the district court

9

judge in a particular case directs it, and so on.

10

And some of those options include service

So that's where you get the authorization.

11

You have to -- the forum State has to authorize the

12

service by mail on a person abroad.

13

At the other end of the process, you have to

14

see whether the receiving State has objected to service

15

by mail.

16

countries that have acceded to or ratified this treaty

17

have indeed objected to service by mail.

18

have given a sort of conditional objection that they'll

19

only service by mail if --

And as my friend indicated, nearly half of the

5

6

we don't.

"service."

8

of them do.

9

also used the word "service" when they've made that

Some of them don't actually use the word

11

many indications that other contracting parties to this

12

convention, like the United States itself, understand

13

that Article 10(a) is about service and not simply about

14

some kind of informational mailing.

So I think that is an indication -- one of

15

So as I said before, we think it would be

16

helpful if the Court would clarify the -- the permit,

17

authorize, object framework.

18

decision that we think best captures this is the

19

Brockmeyer decision from the Ninth Circuit, which lays

20

this out correctly and also has a very helpful

21

discussion of how Rule 4 interacts with the treaty.

22

The court of appeals

Beyond that, as my friend said, there are a

23

lot of textual indications here that this is a

24

convention that is about service.

25

that he didn't touch on, there's a structural argument,

Alderson Reporting Company

Just to highlight one

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

which is that Articles 8, 9, 10(b), 10(c), 11 are all

2

about alternative channels for service, and it would be

3

very odd for this convention to suddenly jump to

4

something that wasn't about service in Article 10(a) and

5

then jump back again to service in 10(b), 10(c), and 11.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why do you think they used a

different word?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

I think my friend correctly

gave the reasons, which is there is a historical reason

10

and a practical reason.

11

think they simply carried over the French word

12

"addresser" from the 1954 civil procedure convention

13

that replaced -- that this convention replaced as to

14

States that were parties to both.

15

understood by everyone and it was clear in context to

16

capture service.

17

the language of the 1954 treaty and the language of

18

Article 10(a) in French, they are virtually identical.

19

It was just the drafters carried it over.

20

that's the way that people understood it.

21

The historical reason is that I

Addresser had been

And so I think if you actually compare

And that

On a practical level I do think that "send"

22

is just a very natural way to refer to putting something

23

in the mail, and so it makes sense to use that verb

24

there rather than a different verb, especially when

25

you're talking about a situation in which the service

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

can go directly from one party to another.

2

We think the contrary interpretations really

3

don't work here, but at the very least there's ambiguity

4

in this treaty, and at that point this Court's decisions

5

are clear; you turn to extrinsic sources of information.

6

Here, each and every extrinsic source points strongly in

7

the direction of the interpretation we're espousing.

8

You have the -- the history, and that is the draft

9

convention and the contemporaneous understanding of

10

people who were there when it was drafted.

11

consistent interpretation of the executive, which is

12

entitled to great weight, and here, has been completely

13

consistent from the beginning till now.

14

consistent interpretation of other contracting parties,

15

which this Court has said are entitled to considerable

16

weight, and you also have an expert consensus among

17

scholars and so on.

18

You have the

You have the

So affirming the court below would take us

19

out of step with the rest of the world.

20

countries are parties to this treaty -- to this treaty,

21

and it could believe an irritant if they think that

22

we're not living up to our obligations.

It also would make service more difficult

for U.S. plaintiffs who are looking to serve defendants

25

who are abroad.

It would take away from them the

ability to use the mails in situations where they might

be trying to serve someone in a country where the

those reasons, we think that the Court should reverse

The lead scholar on this, which is cited to in both

analysis about all these different cases that -- on this

I -- I think that

8

leading scholar -- maybe I'm wrong, but I thought I read

9

it, thought that it -- that it may have been the

10

scrivener's mistake, but the intent was clearly to

11

effect service by the --

12

MR. HOOTMAN:

13

their side of the camp.

14

It clearly comes down on -- on
That -- that's undoubtedly.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this leading scholar

15

calls it a misuse of words, but that the intent was

16

clear in -- for all the reasons everyone else is giving?

17

MR. HOOTMAN:

Exactly.

And it also uses a

18

similar analysis that the dissenting opinion in the

19

Texas Court of Appeals said.

20

these other things out there beyond the text to -- to

21

come up --

22

Basically, you look at all

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why is this clear?

23

Your adversary says isn't the lack of clarity inherent

24

in the question; what do they mean by "send"?

25

don't define "send."

They

They don't define "service."

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

doesn't that automatically create an ambiguity?

2

isn't the ambiguity approached the way the other side

3

says?

4

MR. HOOTMAN:

Okay.

And why

First of all, I do not

5

think that there is an ambiguity in -- in this

6

particular point that we're all here talking about.

7

I -- and I say that for the reasons that were cited

8

basically in the Fifth Circuit opinion, but that whereas

9

if you take the words to "effect service" -- or

And

10

actually, "effect service of" -- and substitute those

11

for "send," then -- then it is crystal clear for them.

12

So then if you use the -- I don't really

13

think it's a canon.

14

usage, that if I alter the -- the word that I'm using

15

throughout a document for something else, well, then I'm

16

just trying to alter the -- the message that I'm

17

sending.

18

I think it's more of a rule of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it a convention on the

19

service of documents?

20

sending documents, but it's a convention -- everything

21

in this convention relates to service, and the whole

22

purpose of it was to facilitate international

23

cooperation in litigation.

It's not a convention about

24

MR. HOOTMAN:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No doubt about it.
And so just -- just as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

in -- in this case, the service is sought to be made in

2

Canada, there will be cases where courts abroad want to

3

serve somebody in the United States.

4

of this was to make it easier to conduct litigation,

5

international -- to facilitate international cooperation

6

in litigation.

7

MR. HOOTMAN:

The whole purpose

No doubt about it.

And I

8

would -- and I would suggest that sending documents

9

that are -- okay.

The -- the question -- the follow-up

10

question from what you're saying, Your Honor, would be,

11

well, what -- what -- does it mean just service of

12

initiating documents, service of process, or service of

13

any judicial documents?

14

Now, if you -- the -- the first part of the

15

treaty talks about service of -- of judicial documents.

16

And so it would seem to me logical to include within a

17

treaty that's focusing on service of documents

18

internationally, also service of documents after service

19

of process.

20

I'm a fairly reasonable man -- so from the reasonable

21

person's perspective, you would think that it -- that

22

you would include service of other types of documents

23

within a service of process treaty.

24
25

And so from my perspective -- and I think

And now also there's a really important
extrajudicial -- and I'm -- I'm going to jump into

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

some extra text --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm -- I'm not grasping

3

what you mean by "process."

4

convention is on the service of documents.

It's on the -- the

5

MR. HOOTMAN:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

Judicial documents.
Yes.

And so is the

7

notion of process the way we think about it in the

8

United States, a process server?

9

is it?

That's not universal,

I mean, a lot of civil law countries don't have

10

the notion of tagging -- having a process server tag the

11

defendant.

12

MR. HOOTMAN:

Right.

Okay.

The -- the

13

history -- okay.

14

textual information which specifically addresses that

15

and a lot of other things.

16

Okay.

I do want to jump into some extra

So the history of this -- of this

17

treaty was -- was such that they weren't -- they were

18

really trying to kill this French method of service

19

in -- in France, "nova de cashiano" -- I don't speak

20

French, so -- but the Schlunk case talks all about it.

21

And -- and the problem there was that an official in

22

France, once you give the citation, the -- the

23

certificate or citation or summons, to the official

24

there, that is service.

25

being entered against parties that never actually got

And so -- so defaults were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1
2

notice.
And so then -- then the United States had --

3

had passed a -- had passed Public Law 88-619 in 1964,

4

whereby we allowed foreign countries to come here and to

5

easily effectuate foreign service by going to a district

6

judge and getting an order signed to serve, say, a

7

French or Ugandan or wherever, a -- a summons on -- on

8

an American -- or whatever person is in the

9

United States.

10
11

So they could get judicial assistance

from the United States very easily.
Okay.

So within the context of that act,

12

then the United States went -- sent their

13

representatives to The Hague to start getting engaged

14

with this -- this Hague Conference to normalize

15

international laws.

16

the other countries to make it easy for our citizens to

17

serve overseas and also to -- to push forward due

18

process, okay.

19

And -- and so the motive was to get

And so then the -- when the drafters,

20

they -- they got this -- this convention prepared, then

21

they came to the -- the Senate committee, and then the

22

lead spokesman at that Senate committee was asked

23

specifically -- and I have the page here -- I don't have

24

it handy, but basically the -- the spokesperson for

25

that -- for America told the Senate -- the senators --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

that the only thing America is giving up is the same

2

thing that we had already given in that Federal act that

3

I just mentioned.

4

anything in it about -- about mail.

5

And that Federal act doesn't have

So -- so the actual lawmakers of the

6

United States that signed off on this treaty were told

7

by the people that participated in the -- in the

8

convention drafting that -- that we're going to -- it

9

wasn't all about service, like you were saying, Your

10

Honor.

11

due process.

12

the same thing that we gave up in -- in this Federal act

13

that I'm talking about.

14

It was either -- it was, in large part, about
And the only thing that we're giving up is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I'm sorry.

Did we

15

give up or do you think they thought we were giving up

16

the right to authorize States to permit service by mail?

17

MR. HOOTMAN:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Service by mail was -Or your position is --

19

is that we did; that in the treaty, we intended, by

20

signing the treaty, to give up the power of States to

21

authorize the service by mail?

22

MR. HOOTMAN:

Service by mail was actually

23

not talked about in the Senate hearings.

24

one --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There was

I'm asking you, do you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

think it's a fair reading of a treaty for us to read it

2

to constrict the rights of States to effect service

3

consistent with due process?

4

that we consider mail service consistent with due

5

process.

Because there's no doubt

6

MR. HOOTMAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Okay -The United States

authorize it, right?

9

MR. HOOTMAN:

Well, the -- under --

10

according to Brockmeyer, the case -- the -- the position

11

that the Solicitor General wants the Court to adopt, the

12

actual holding in that case was that the Article 10(a)

13

does -- does not authorize service by mail.

14

it --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. HOOTMAN:

17

All right.

-- meaning, you've got to look

at the local law --

18
19

It permits

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I accept that.

But

many states permit service by mail, correct?

20

MR. HOOTMAN:

Well, Texas doesn't, according

21

to the majority opinion in this case, because all four

22

of my points were sustained in the -- in the lower

23

court.

24

or not Texas authorizes service by mail.

25

And one of those points was specifically whether

So if you were to --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- take Rule -- Rule

2

4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

3

authorizes service, as in the courts of the State where

4

the district court is located.

5

Sotomayor is referring to some States -- not Texas --

6

but some States do authorize service of the summons and

7

complaint by mail.

8
9

MR. HOOTMAN:
do.

It

And I think Justice

I'm sure some States somewhere

They -- they could theoretically, let's put it that

10

way.

11

up to the question of -- okay, let me -- let me put this

12

way.

And so then you -- then you -- then you're with --

13

In Brockmeyer, the Court said that the

14

treaty does not authorize it, but Rule 4(f) of the

15

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows it in some

16

circumstances; namely, when the clerk sends it.

17

clerk can mail the -- the process, but the party can't

18

and, therefore, I win in my case.

19

So the

Now, in this -- in my case, the Texas -- the

20

Texas Court of Appeals, the majority opinion actually

21

sustained all four of my issues that were raised in

22

the -- in the court of appeals.

23

and by the way, the -- the dissent said I waived that

24

one issue, but -- but the majority of that panel

25

sustained it, which -- and that issue was whether or not

And one of those was --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

Texas law authorizes service by mail.

2

So if the Brockmeyer logic were to be

3

adopted by this Court, you would basically say, well,

4

yes, the -- the treaty permits it, permits it being

5

service by mail, if the local law allows it.

6

yes, it's permitted, but the Texas court has already

7

ruled on it and, therefore, a decision -- the lower

8

court's ruling is affirmed.

9

And so,

So -- so even if you go this -- this route

10

of it's not authorized, but it's permitted, you still

11

have to affirm the -- the Texas judgment because the

12

majority said that --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if it's -- if it's

14

permitted under a Federal treaty, then how can Texas not

15

permit it?

16

MR. HOOTMAN:

Because unless -- that took me

17

a long time to figure that distinction out.

18

basically, the question is -- and the question of the

19

service was granted on is whether or not the treaty

20

authorizes service by mail.

21

itself says you can serve pursuant to the treaty by

22

sending it in the mail versus the Brockmeyer

23

distinction, which is that the treaty doesn't say that

24

you serve by mail pursuant to the treaty, rather, that

25

the treaty allows the other States or the Federal

But

That means the treaty

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

government to pass a rule so that the local law, the

2

local United States law allows service by mail.

3

So then Brockmeyer says work through that and said,

4

well, yes, Rule -- Rule 4(f) permits it, but only if the

5

clerk sends it.

6

send it, the default was set aside.

7

Okay.

And since the clerk in that case didn't

And so -- then then you take that line of

8

thinking and apply it to my case and you say, okay,

9

well, no, the treaty doesn't authorize it, because we

10

follow the Brockmeyer line of thinking, but it does

11

permit it if Texas law allows it.

12

already passed on it and said -- in the majority

13

opinion, because they sustained my four issues, Texas

14

law does not authorize service by mail.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, a Texas court

I'm sorry.

I thought --

16

I thought I had read this and I'm looking at it.

17

blue brief at page 9 says, "Under Texas law, a plaintiff

18

can serve a foreign defendant in several ways, including

19

by certified mail return receipt requested, either by

20

sending it to any defendant directly, or if certain

21

conditions are met, by sending it to the Secretary of

22

State, by complying with the provisions of any

23

applicable treaty, and if certain other conditions are

24

met by other court-ordered means."

25

The

So -- and there's a citation to the two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

sections of the Texas Civil Procedure Act.

2

to me that Texas law, on its face, authorizes service by

3

certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any

4

other court-ordered means.

5

ineffective under Texas law?

6

MR. HOOTMAN:

So why was the service here

Right.

7

Rule of Civil Procedure 108(a).

8

of process in foreign countries.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. HOOTMAN:

So it seems

It's rule -- Texas
It's entitled service

Right.

Right.

And it -- and it

11

provided -- it has all this stuff that can happen.

12

Basically, there's about -- there's six different ways

13

that it can occur.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why wasn't the

15

service here pursuant to one of those authorized Texas

16

ways?

17

MR. HOOTMAN:

Well, the short answer is

18

because the Texas court said it wasn't the proper way to

19

do it.

20

that would be similar to the Brockmeyer holding,

21

which -- which is because it was sent by -- I walked

22

down -- I walked down to the post office and dropped a

23

summons in the mail and send it to Uganda or wherever to

24

serve somebody, the Texas court said you can't do that.

25

Now, I think the more sophisticated response to

Now, in the Brockmeyer case, the specific

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

reason was is because the clerk didn't do that.

2

the clerk -- I -- I send a request to the -- to the

3

clerk and I say, hey, please send this -- this summons

4

to Uganda and they drop it in the mail, that would be

5

appropriate under -- under the Ninth Circuit case.

6

Okay?

7

you follow the Brockmeyer line of thinking, you have

8

to -- to -- service by mail is proper, if our local

9

authority allows it.

Now, if

But the -- but the point here is that -- that if

And in our case, the majority

10

opinion sustained all four points, and one of those

11

points was that Texas law doesn't allow it.

12

And -- and also, you know, the technical --

13

I don't mean to be overly technical, but we didn't --

14

you didn't grant cert on the question of whether or not

15

the Texas law allows it.

16

not the treaty authorizes it.

17

We -- we granted on whether or

And so I've got that holding from the Texas

18

court on the Texas law.

19

assuming you get to that.

20

that is if you say that the treaty -- if you say that

21

the treaty authorizes service by mail, you don't even

22

get into that can of worms, because the treaty itself is

23

the vehicle through which you're serving process.

24

Okay?

25

I think that's dispositive,
And the only way you get to

If you follow the Brockmeyer line of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

thinking, you say, well, no, the treaty doesn't

2

authorize it, but it permits it, then you run into the

3

Texas majority holding which has already ruled on that

4

question.

5

And -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think it's a problem

6

for your position that no other court in the world has

7

construed the treaty this way?

8

MR. HOOTMAN:

9

That's why I focused so hard on text.

That's clearly a problem.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. HOOTMAN:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

I mean -- I mean -Someone's got to be

first, right?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. HOOTMAN:

Then that now -- that is why I

16

cited to -- I forgot what they call it, but it's

17

basically the -- the restatement of law in Europe.

18

That's why I cited to that, to see what their mindset

19

is.

20

brief, but basically, they will look at a document when

21

they're interpreting it, if it says X, but -- but

22

everyone's intent was Y, they go with Y.

23

that just runs train -- a steam train roller over our

24

separation of powers concept.

25

And I don't know if you recall that quote in my

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's --

Well, this goes back to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

Justice Alito's question.

2

your answer to it, that it's just they're all construing

3

this because he -- they use a completely different

4

interpretive stance than we do?

I mean, is that -- is that

5

MR. HOOTMAN:

6

whole different mindset.

7

subjectivity of what everybody wanted.

8

because of our separation of powers, who's the law

9

maker, that's why I go off in the area and all that

No doubt about it.

It's a

They -- they're looking at the
And here,

10

other really interesting stuff, and I think it's

11

actually crucial here because --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, one question I suppose

13

might be whether that is in fact producing the disparity

14

in -- in judgments.

15

it is, I mean, these are treaties.

16

you know, we would be consistently interpreting a treaty

17

differently from the entire rest of the world would seem

18

to create problems for our treaty-making powers, for

19

our -- our ability to conform with what our treaty

20

partners expect.

21

problem for international relations, wouldn't it?

22

we're like, well, we just interpret everything that we

23

write differently from the way everybody else in the

24

world does.

25

But even suppose you're right that
So the idea that,

I mean, it would be -- be sort of a

MR. HOOTMAN:

Clearly, we've got to be

Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

respectful to our foreign friends.

2

want to be -- come across as, you know, arrogant four

3

sort of thinking.

4

Okay.

5

Constitution.

6

lawmakers.

7

Clearly, we don't

We do have also to respect the

Who -- who passes these laws?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

You are taking a

8

statement from a -- it's not exactly restatement; it's

9

sort of this European project written by a law professor

10

in Denmark.

11

all Europeans -- they don't -- you don't think that they

12

have the same debates that we have on the extent to

13

which you go beyond the text?

14

about the way you interpret text and it's all that --

15

what Orlando said is -- that's true, generally?

16

you find it -- they have the same debates that we do.

17

And you're saying that's how

MR. HOOTMAN:

You think they all agree

I think

I'm definitely no European

18

legal scholar, by any means, but I do -- I do believe

19

that -- that cite that I gave, I did some research to

20

see how respected it was, and I believe -- maybe I'm

21

wrong on that, but I think it's on par with our

22

restatement.

23
24
25

Do they -- do they do what we do here?
Well, if you look at the Vienna Convention -And someone brought that up, by the way.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

The Vienna Convention says how you're supposed to

2

interpret treaties. They actually do the opposite of

3

that, that quote that -- that you're -- that I gave you

4

and now you're giving back to me.

5

on text, just like I'm urging the Court to do under our

6

separation of powers doctrine.

And they focus hard

7

So I surmise that -- that a fair amount of

8

them do look at that -- that section, but then a whole

9

lot of 'em others also surely look at the Vienna

10

Convention, because they're the ones that most of the

11

European countries, if not all of them, have actually

12

signed off on it.

13

And the United States has not.

But it is -- it is a codification of

14

customary international law.

15

if -- depending on how much emphasis we put on customary

16

international law, we're going to look at the Vienna

17

Convention to help us interpret a treaty, assuming you

18

get beyond the text like I've urged the Court in the

19

first half of my brief.

And, therefore, you know,

20

So in answer to your question --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the source that

22

you cite is not talking about the interpretation of

23

statutes; it's talking about the interpretation of

24

private contracts between two individuals.

25

MR. HOOTMAN:

That's primarily the -- yes, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

would agree with that.

2

cite to that as, oh, look here, here's my number one

3

cite at all.

4

on, hey, look, I do have all these international cases

5

against me, but let's look at their mindset a little

6

bit.

7

And I -- and I didn't mean to

I was just trying to give a perspective

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one of the --

8

I mean, if you are talking about -- and I think this is

9

a distinction between statutes and treaties.

We

10

visualize treaties, anyway, as close to -- to contracts.

11

And if you're talking about contracts, it's very

12

important to -- what the conduct and expectations of the

13

parties were as they went into the contract, and it's

14

significant evidence of sort of how they dealt with the

15

situations after the contract, somewhat unlike how you

16

might interpret a statute.

17

MR. HOOTMAN:

I have a real problem -- and I

18

realize the cases make this analogy to contracts -- but

19

I have a real problem with that analogy, because it --

20

it doesn't factor in the -- the Constitution.

21

adopt a treaty and make it a Federal law, just like a

22

Federal statute, except it's done through the President

23

and et cetera.

24
25

We -- we

And so it's really not -- yes, it's like a
contract, but, no, it's not.

Because this Court has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

apply the Constitution to it.

2

you have the drafters and then the nice Bartleby's

3

error, the scrivener's error -- and by the way, this

4

Court has written on when there's a scrivener's error,

5

we're not going to just fix it, because that's

6

legislating.

7

know, a ridiculous -- the absurdity doctrine and it's

8

got a -- so under -- under you-all's kind of authority,

9

you can't just fix the scrivener's error.

10

And so here, you -- if --

Unless -- unless the error has -- has, you

And so the scholar, Mr. Ristau, I thought,

11

did me a great favor by, yes, he went page after page

12

separation of powers doctrine principles to that, you

15

can't just fix it because there's a logical reason to

16

include service of -- service of process-type documents.

17

Because it makes perfect -- to me, it makes perfectly

18

good sense.

19

sense to me to not include that in there.

And so you are bound by the

of the treaty and say:

Well, it's not authorized.

2

So that's kind of how I analyze it.

3

And then -- and then I really want -- this,

4

to me, is a really big point, and I haven't articulated

5

it well, but the Solicitor General cited to the Senate

6

Record where the -- the international guys that went

7

over to the Hague and brought this beautiful treaty that

8

they put a whole lot of work into with the history of

9

this -- this Federal statute that I'm talking about,

10

everyone wanted to start cooperating.

11

Then they get before the Senate testifying,

12

and one of the senators is asking something like, well,

13

what do we get out of this?

14

this section in there, it's -- it's on -- it's on

15

page 24 and 25, he's the U.S. delegate, Philip Amram,

16

and -- and he said due process and also we are giving

17

nothing we had not already given in -- in Public Law

18

88619.

19

And -- and -- and he's got

So the senators that actually signed off on

20

this, that's what they heard.

21

that that -- it's so important, I put it in my little

22

book here.

23

back then, because America says:

24

let the foreigners come over here, go to a district

25

judge, request an order to serve, you know, a French

Okay.

And you got to understand

That Public Law 88619 was a big deal

And then after that -- and that was a -- you

5

We open our

So they go -- they go -- they go prepare

6

this treaty, and then they come back and testify to

7

the -- to the people that are going to actually make our

8

law and they tell them that's -- that's what -- what

9

happened.

10
11

And now we got this mail thing going on.
So -- so from the lawmakers' perspective,

they didn't actually hear that.

12

Now, there is a bar review article that the

13

same man that testified, Mr. Amram, there's a little

14

section in there, which the Solicitor General cites in

15

their brief, where they say something like service by

16

mail.

17

about this treaty, a little bit mind-numbing.

18

it's -- and then he says Article 10(a) service by mail,

19

it's a little bitty snippet.

20

Senate record.

21

by mail says the same thing that the treaty says.

22

doesn't say service of process by mail.

23

He -- and I read the article.

It goes on and on
But

You can see it in the

And so, to me, it would seem like you don't

24

have an ambiguity here.

25

that makes perfectly good sense to allow service of

post -- service of process documents, and you can't fix

2

the Bartleby, the scrivener error because of you-all's

3

previous cases, Chan v. Korea, in particular.

4

And -- and then you have the other issue,

5

which is even if you go with this Brockmeyer scenario,

6

then -- then Texas has already passed on this question,

7

and Texas law doesn't allow service by the participant

8

by mail.

9
10

And so you got to affirm anyway.
So if there's no further questions, I'll

turn it over to the other -- other side.

MR. GASTON:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Gaston, would you

19

start with the Brockmeyer question?

20

the government on the issue that the treaty only

21

permits, doesn't necessarily authorize?

22

adversary's position that the Texas court has already

said that under Texas law, you can't serve this way.

States' position and it points out, actually, an

2

ambiguity in the world "authorize," which is the

3

question presented that -- that -- that ambiguity is my

4

responsibility, because "authorized" can mean empower or

5

it can mean permit.

6

what the Brockmeyer case reads it as, it's what the

7

United States suggests is correct, and we -- we think

8

that is correct because of the ambiguity in the statute

9

of what the freedom to do things means.

10

And in this situation, permit is

And -- and I would also alert the Court to

11

some more specific discussion of that.

12

Bureau of the Hague Conference puts out a handbook every

13

so many years, and the 2016 edition, which is the fourth

14

the court of appeals here has already ruled that service

the result of the holding because the Court held that

2

this Court in Schlunk said.

3

is -- is mandatory and it preempts inconsistent methods

4

of service under -- under State or Federal law.

5

that was not a determination that, apart from the

6

treaty, service of process here was not consistent with

7

Texas law and --

And that's what the --

It said that the treaty

question before us?

10

MR. GASTON:

No.

I would say it has been --

11

it has been decided by this Court in -- in Schlunk, and

12

the Court -- and it cited a prior case --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we're not

14

being asked to rule on that because I gather the Texas

15

Court of Appeals has a different view on that.

16

MR. GASTON:

I think the Texas Court of

17

Appeals has the same view, which is that -- that if the

18

treaty prohibits service by mail, the fact that it's

19

authorized under Texas law is dead letter and

20

therefore --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we were told by the

other side that Texas law -- forget about treaties --

2

determinations that we -- this Texas State law that we

3

cite at pages 9 and 10 of -- of the blue brief provide

4

three or four ways in which service of process by mail

5

on --

6

And the Texas State law

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you win in -- this

7

Article 10, in fact, permits service by mail, then

8

you'll go back to Texas and you'll say, see, it permits

9

it expressly.

So the rest of the treaty doesn't preempt

10

the provision that allows service by mail, so Texas law

11

no longer prohibits it; is that right?

12

MR. GASTON:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
So we should send it back.
It doesn't say that

15

at all.

16

convention shall interfere with a particular way.

17

then you simply say if you're right, okay, the

18

convention doesn't interfere with it, but Texas law can

19

prohibit it.

What Article 10 says is whether or not the

MR. GASTON:

No, the court of appeals held

that The Hague Service Convention prohibits service of

process by mail and, therefore, it sustained the

it just never got to this question of what Texas law

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. GASTON:

Correct.
Okay.

On our blue brief at 32 and 33,

14

I think it's clear, not only did the negotiator for the

15

United States tell the Senate that this treaty involved

16

service -- allowed service by mail and the Executive

17

Branch internally relayed that message to the -- to the

18

President, so it's very clear internally that the

19

United States Executive Branch understood that the

20

United States' intent was that it allowed service by

21

mail.

22

process and service of post-answer documents.

23

Respondent makes a distinction between service of

I think while one might imagine a treaty

24

that would do that, this treaty doesn't make any

25

internal distinctions between judicial documents that

Alderson Reporting Company

44

are process and other judicial documents with the

2

limited exception of Article 15 that only talks about

3

getting relief from a default judgment with respect to a

summons not -- not being served.

5

court has said, it would be very odd if Article 10(a)

6

was about service of every judicial document except

7

process, which is what would be required to -- to go

8

with Respondent's interpretation.

And so as one lower
