ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether FEHBA

12

preempts State laws that forbid subrogation by insurance

13

carriers.

14

rule, but we believe that is wrong for at least three

15

reasons.

16

The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the State

Number one, antisubrogation laws relate to

17

benefits and coverage, as this Court concluded in FMC v.

18

Holliday, and at the very least, they relate to payments

19

with respect to benefits.

20

Number two, if there's any ambiguity on this

21

point, OPM's notice-and-comment regulation answers a

22

question in favor of preemption.

23

And number three, although the majority of

24

the Supreme Court of Missouri thought otherwise, we

25

believe there's no constitutional infirmity in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1
2

Section 8902(m)(1) under the Supremacy Clause.
If I could turn to my first point, it seems

3

to us that the antisubrogation rule in this case is

4

preempted for basically the same reasons this Court

5

considered in FMC in concluding that the same rule was

6

preempted under ERISA.

7

effectively requires plan administrators to calculate

8

benefits on the basis of different liability conditions

9

that vary from State to State; that very importantly, it

That is to say that it

10

undermines the statute's goal of uniformity; and third,

11

that it could encourage plan sponsors, in this case, the

12

Federal government, to reduce the scope of coverage.

13

In addition to those reasons, this statute

14

gives you an additional reason to find that it is

15

preempted, and that is that it also preempts those rules

16

that relate to payments with respect to benefits.

17

It is quite clear to us that the subrogation

18

and reimbursement claims that are at issue in these

19

rules quite plainly refer to and relate to payments with

20

respect to benefits; and therefore, the Supreme Court of

21

Missouri was wrong in overlooking that part of the

22

statute and also wrong in overlooking your decision in

23

FMC v. Holliday.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any -- any room

at all for State regulation of carriers who have these

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

contracts with OPM?

2

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, to be sure, the -- the

3

statute, if you focus on the last clause -- now, the

4

statute appears in page 2 of the blue brief -- if you

5

focus on the last clause, the statute only reaches those

6

State laws that, quote, "relate to health insurance or

7

plans."

8

not be reached by these laws, or by other laws, and also

9

subjects that are not related to benefits, coverage or

10

And there are any number of subjects that may

payments with respect to benefits.

11

Congress dealt separately in Section -- in

12

Section 8909(f) with the subject of taxation in the

13

context of these plans and generally provided that

14

carriers may be subject to generally-applicable laws

15

that are applicable to all businesses under profits and

16

-- and the like, but that States, you know, may not tax,

17

you know, the benefits and the payments.

18

And so Congress has, in fact, crafted a

19

limited preemption provision that singles out those laws

20

that are most likely to apply to the insurance plans at

21

issue, and then only say that the scope of the

22

preemption will be defined by particular terms of the

23

contract.

24

of this law is somewhat more limited than the -- that of

25

the ERISA statute because, although your "relate"

And so in our view, in some ways, the reach

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

language is identical and they should have identical

2

scope with respect to benefits coverage and -- and

3

payments with respect to benefits, it does not reach all

4

laws of the State.

5

health insurance -- those laws that relate to health

6

insurance or plans.

7
8

It targets, to begin with, only the

Now, if I could get to the second point, we
recognize that --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Before you do, I mean, we

10

appeared to find this a difficult question in McVeigh.

11

We said there were two plausible readings.

12

was a hard statute.

13

the two.

14

We didn't want to decide as between

You know, what do you make of that case?
MR. ESTRADA:

I actually was going to be the

15

headline on my second point, Justice Kagan.

16

you.

17

We said it

So thank

You know, we recognize that McVeigh

18

considered the same statute and concluded that the

19

statute did not give rise to a cause of action in

20

Federal subject matter jurisdiction.

21

that that question was indeed difficult, because unlike

22

ERISA, where Congress expressly provided a cause of

23

action in Section 502 of that statute, Congress had not

24

done so here.

25

to imply common law cause of action out of the terms of

And we believe

And the Court was basically being asked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

what otherwise appears to be a defensive preemption

2

prohibition, which is relatively rare.

3

The background rule in the Federal system is

4

that Federal preemption is a defense only, as we learned

5

in the Motley case.

6

had was in transforming what it otherwise would be a

7

defense into a cause of action and implying Federal

8

jurisdiction.

9

And the difficulty that the Court

I think that context is extremely important

10

to understand the Court's caveat as to the text of the

11

statute, because the question then was will the statute

12

would bear a construction that was expansive indeed with

13

respect to an entirely different subject matter.

14

With -- with respect to the question of

15

whether the Court considered the statute as being

16

susceptible on the merits of the defense to plausible

17

alternative constructions, I think if you look at the

18

relevant passage, what the Court said was that different

19

constructions were being urged upon the Court; on the

20

one hand, one by the United States, and on the other

21

hand, another one by the Cruz plaintiffs out of the

22

Seventh Circuit.

23

The Court described both of them generally

24

as plausible and wrote to saying that it didn't have to

25

pick either of them.

We do not believe that that sort

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

of description of the litigants' position really rises

2

to the finding that the statute is ambiguous as a

3

threshold for even a Chevron analysis, because the Court

4

was not considering any canon of construction, was not

5

considering context, was not considering purpose.

6

was simply describing the position of litigants in front

7

of this Court and concluding that it was unnecessary to

8

pick one or the other.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It

Counsel, in this case you

10

have an express-preemption provision.

11

Federal entity that makes the contract.

So that may be

12

all you need to say in order to prevail.

But there --

13

are there some limiting principles that we -- should

14

just be in the back of our mind when we think about

15

preemption?

16

case.

17

no express preemption.

18

You have a

The case in Boyle was, I think, a close

Completely different from this because there was

So it's not really your obligation to

19

direct -- to address a parade of horribles that isn't in

20

this case, but are there some general limiting

21

principles that we should keep in mind when determining

22

whether or not preemption, A, existed; B, is permitted?

23

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, of course.

You know,

24

you have, really, three headings of preemption under

25

this Court's doctrine.

You have conflict where you take

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

the text of the statute and decide whether the State

2

rule actually conflicts as a -- as the label says.

3

I think that's the common form that comes in front of

4

the Court, and I think that's just a question of

5

ordinary statutory interpretation applying all the

6

relevant canons and considering as well the -- the

7

purpose of Congress.

8
9

And

The harder cases are ones like Hillman v.
Maretta where you're not dealing with actual language of

10

the statute, but you're considering whether the State

11

law is an obstacle to what Congress wanting -- wanted to

12

get at.

13

except as an a fortiori type argument as to how this

14

would be out even under that rule.

15

And this case does not involve that problem

But the issue in this case seems to me to be

16

what you have here, where Congress had exercised an

17

appropriate level of Federal power under Section --

18

under Article 1 Section 8, and then has gone further by

19

itself declaring what it views as the consequences with

20

a Federal/State balance.

21

to us that it is especially inappropriate to consider

22

what the conceivable limits would be of a doctrine that

23

arises practically in every case.

24
25

And in this context, it seems

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe one

doctrine has to do with the delegation issue.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

Suppose Congress passed a law that said,

2

well, any professional responsibility -- any

3

professional responsibility rule adopted by the ABA will

4

preempt contrary State law.

5

Is that okay under preemption doctrine?

6

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it seems to me likely

7

not, but let me take apart what I think are the key

8

aspects of the consequence of the -- of that answer.

9

First, Congress has to identify a part of

10

Article 1, Section 8 that gives it a head of

11

constitutional authority to do what you just described.

12

Second, to my --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

you just saying this is beyond -- regulating the --

15

MR. ESTRADA:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

beyond Congress's power?

MR. ESTRADA:

21
22

Are you just -- are

Well --- profession is

-- as described, is not

self-evidently connected to any one of the -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Well, assume

it is within Congress's power to legislate.
MR. ESTRADA:

When -- then there's a

23

question of identifying what it is that Congress is

24

trying to do.

25

adopted what otherwise would be State -- State rules for

It is, in fact, true that Congress has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

the government of certain issues.

2

things like you have -- like the assimilated crime

3

statute, for example.

4

how closely it is tied to the relevant heading of power

5

and then whether Congress has provided enough

6

governmental supervision for the activity so that it is

7

subject to a delegated exercise of power under

8

appropriate standards by an ultimately responsible

9

authority.

10

You know, you have

And, you know, the question is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess, is it --

11

you know, in some of those areas, you're talking about

12

State governments.

13

to delegate the authority to decide what laws are

14

preempted to a private entity?

15

Is -- is it permissible for Congress

MR. ESTRADA:

I think it depends on how it

16

does it.

17

whatever crisis or problem Congress may be considering,

18

that there's a particular avenue of dealing with them

19

that is completely foreclosed.

20

there are limits to the ability of Congress to do such

21

things, it seems to me that a precondition for Congress'

22

ability to do that would be to do something like has

23

happened, for example, in the securities markets where

24

you have what are called self-regulatory organizations

25

where trade groups, in effect, have rules that apply to

I would be reluctant to say that considering

But to the extent that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

parts of the industry, but they're strictly supervised

2

and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission

3

and there is recourse for their violation to go in

4

Federal court.

5

Now, those rules in some cases are

6

considered preemptive, and so I don't want to foreclose,

7

you know, the proposition that as a category using an

8

industry group or a private group, so long as it is

9

subject to appropriate government supervision, could not

10

be a possible tool that Congress could use.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. ESTRADA:

Well --

But in that event -- if I

13

could just finish -- but in that event, you would also

14

have the additional layer of involvement having to do

15

with the limit that this Court itself has placed on the

16

-- on the delegation by Congress -- Congress of any

17

authority.

18

Nondelegation Doctrine.

19

You do have something called the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what about two

20

private parties, whether, you know -- whatever they are,

21

a railroad and a shipper, in other words, and Congress

22

says, whatever you agree to will preempt contrary State

23

laws.

24

MR. ESTRADA:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I believe --

Alderson Reporting Company

I know you're going

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

to suggest --

2

MR. ESTRADA:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

No.
-- it's not this

case --

5

MR. ESTRADA:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. ESTRADA:

No, no.

I understand --- but assume it is.

I understand that, Mr. Chief

8

Justice.

9

lawfully give a blank check to private individuals

I find it hard to believe that Congress could

10

without any subject -- without any government

11

supervision and/or without appropriate standards as to

12

what it is that they may do or not do.

13

distinguish the hypothetical that you posit from what's

14

at issue in this case.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I want to

Well, before you

16

get -- get to that, I mean, it would seem to me that you

17

could deal with the concerns you have and still address

18

the problem.

19

You know, it -- any rate between, you know, $10 per mile

20

and $30 per mile, but you, the parties, you know, we

21

want to give the -- the free enterprise system a little

22

more scope than having the government set it.

23

whatever rate you set between $10 and $30 a ton or a

24

mile will preempt contrary State regulation.

25

In other words, it's not a blank check.

MR. ESTRADA:

So

Again, it seems to me that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

this is a question to some extent of conceptualizing.

2

think I am agreeing with the basic premise of your

3

question, Mr. Chief Justice, but there are, of course,

4

limits to the ability of Congress to delegate to private

5

individuals.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question, I think,

7

which is perhaps truly speculative, but it is rather

8

interesting, if we go back to the sick chicken,

9

Schechter --

10

MR. ESTRADA:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Well, I was going to go there.

MR. ESTRADA:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.

MR. ESTRADA:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

-- of whether Congress has

this Article 8 power to legislate at all in the area.

16

18

-- there first is a

question --

13

15

Uh-huh.
You assume the answer's

yes.
The second is a nondelegation question.

20

There, the delegation had run riot.

21

used the words "unfair competition" instead of "fair

22

competition" and, therefore, they had satisfied the

23

Nondelegation Doctrine.

24
25

I

But suppose they'd

Given the satisfaction of the -- of the
source of power and satisfaction of the delegation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

doctrine or nondelegation, is there additional

2

requirement?

3

were parts of that that preempted as there must have

4

been, is that a separate doctrine that imposes yet a

5

further restriction, or once the first two are

6

satisfied, have you automatically satisfied the third?

7

Does the preemption matter, assuming there

MR. ESTRADA:

I find it hard to say that

8

there's an independent limit on the basis of preemption,

9

because, as I understand the power of Congress, Congress

10

could pass a statute that displaces all law in a subject

11

matter and renders it a law-free area, for example.

12

so I don't know that I would ever say that in dealing

13

with a crisis like the Great Depression, for example,

14

Congress could not turn to the type of remedies that it

15

tried in the Schechter case and that those would be

16

completely foreclosed to Congress.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

But -Yeah.

But the

18

idea -- the concern is -- raised by your friend on the

19

other side is, yes, Congress can do that.

20

MR. ESTRADA:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

about the preemption of State law.

23

whether or not they've authorized someone not subject to

24

the political constraints that Congress is subject to to

25

undertake that pretty significant step of telling State

Uh-huh.

Alderson Reporting Company

But we're talking
And the question is

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

law -- State legislators that they can't legislate.

2

MR. ESTRADA:

But if I could just pivot to

3

what -- why the -- the argument doesn't really fit what

4

the problem is that we have in this case, even though it

5

is preemption, is that it arises ostensibly because the

6

statute literally says that the terms of its statute

7

would supersede and preempt.

8

the statute that what Congress actually intended to say

9

and the words will bear is that the terms of the statute

It is quite evident from

10

shall be effective notwithstanding the contrary, et

11

cetera, et cetera.

12

And that although I understand that the

13

whole delegation going down, you know, the -- the road

14

of delegation is very interesting, I will point out that

15

nowhere has a delegation challenge as such been raised

16

in this case in any of the lower courts, and that it was

17

only in this Court that this was reconceptualized as

18

that.

19

I think the proper way to conceptualize what

20

Congress has done in this statute, as it has in many

21

other statutes, is that it has displaced State law to

22

create room for the operation unimpeded of certain

23

contract terms that it believed should be encouraged for

24

the public interest.

25

example of that, even though it is a purely private

The Federal Arbitration Act is one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

statute.

2

mentioning earlier, ERISA, is another.

You know, the -- the statute that we're

3

I will simply say that if Congress can do

4

that to make room for the operation of purely private

5

contracts, a context that involves Federal benefits for

6

the Federal workforce under Federal contracts

7

administered by a Federal agency is something that

8

Congress can clearly deal with, because under Clearfield

9

Trust and its progeny, these contracts would be governed

10

by Federal common law in any event, and that law would

11

be preemptive, at least in certain circumstances.

12

So it is certainly appropriate for Congress

13

to identify itself the outlines and limits of the

14

preemption than to leave it to ad hoc adjudication of

15

common law claims by the Federal courts in this country.

16

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. TRIPP:

I guess our basic take is that

12

the answer to that doesn't really matter because we've

13

picked one of the two interpretations and it's really up

14

to Respondent to show that our interpretation is not

15

16

that they can do that.

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

And so that's what I was

23

wanting to get at and explain how these regulations

24

work.

25

emphasize here is that in the preemption provision, the

And I -- so I think the key point that I want to

crucial language is, is what is the nature and extent of

2

the benefits and benefit payments available under one of

4

administering under a different provision of the

6

such benefits and limitations and other definitions of

7

benefits as it considers necessary or desirable.

8

So those two things go hand in hand.

9

And that is tied to something OPM is already

22

mean, I think the concern is it's bad enough that

23

they're preempting State law, but now they get

24

deference.

25

terms are plausible.

I -- I understood Justice Sotomayor to want to

They can preempt State law so long as their

MR. TRIPP:

Right.

So -- so I think we

2

would win this case even without Chevron deference,

3

without the regulations.

4

better of the two readings of the statute.

5

application of the presumption against preemption here,

6

I think, is really just fundamentally misguided.

7

only do we have an express-preemption provision, we're

8

talking about Federal benefits for Federal employees

9

under Federal contracts entered into under a Federal

I think we just have the
The

Not

10

statute.

11

if Missouri can prohibit subrogation, then what happens

12

is that Federal workers in Illinois who are enrolled in

13

the same plan and paying the same premiums are footing

14

the bill for benefit payments they can't even keep, and

15

it's not part of a State's traditional authority to

16

impose those kinds of externalities on out-of-State

17

Federal workers.

18

And the way this would work on the ground is

So what I was getting at, and the answer to

19

Justice Sotomayor's question, is that we would clearly

20

get deference here on -- on 8902(d) in determining what

21

are -- what are the definitions and are there

22

limitations on benefits available under a plan?

23

think under Chevron, it doesn't make much sense for us

24

to get less deference in determining what is the nature

25

and extent of benefits and benefit payments, if it's

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

really just another way of saying the same thing.

2

So, on -- on why it's important -- I think I

3

covered this a little before -- but to be very concrete

4

about this, in the D.C. metro region, Virginia prohibits

5

subrogation, but Maryland and the District of Columbia

6

do not.

7

Federal workers working for the same agency, enrolled in

8

the same plan, and paying the same premiums would have

9

different benefits and -- and the different extent of

Under Respondent's position, similarly-situated

10

benefit payments, depending on whether they lived in

11

Bethesda or McLean.

We think that's just clearly wrong.

12

And then on -- on -- on --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, you understand

14

the problem, and I understand the argument that it's

15

semantic, but sometimes semantics matter.

16

to take care of that problem, you just have to pass a

17

law saying that the -- the State laws are preempted --

18

MR. TRIPP:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

Yeah.

If you wanted

And then -- then -But you don't.

It

says that the contract is what preempts the State laws.
MR. TRIPP:

Sure.

And I -- and I think what

22

my -- my brother said was exactly right.

23

turn to the statute, I'd like to illustrate why I think

24

it really proves as no constitutional problem at all.

25

It's on page 2 of the blue brief or page 3 of the gray

If you just

brief.
It says that the terms of these Federal

3

contracts shall supersede and preempt State or local law

4

relating to health insurance or plans.

5

clearly means is that the terms of the contract shall

6

apply notwithstanding State or local law.

7

obstante provision like the Supremacy Clause itself, and

8

I think when you read it that way, it makes it crystal

9

clear that the -- that the statute is doing all the

10

preempting here.

11

enable OPM --

What that

It's a non

It's creating a protective umbrella to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

the statute, it's perfectly clear.

14

mean, it says preempt.

15

MR. TRIPP:

If -- if you edit
It doesn't say -- I

And -- and I think what I was

16

getting at is, I think it's a perfectly natural reading

17

of shall supersede and preempt to interpret that to mean

18

shall apply notwithstanding, because the -- the

19

Supremacy Clause itself has similar language about

20

notwithstanding.

21

Congress was getting at here.

22

benefits -- general -- general Federal benefits statute

23

has this same language, so it's health insurance, life,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. WESSLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

9

A decade ago in McVeigh, this Court stressed

10

that FEHBA's express-preemption clause requires cautious

11

interpretation.

12

Section 8902(m)(1) was, in Congress's own words,

13

purposely limited and not designed to disturb the

14

important role that States play in regulating those

15

private insurers who participate in the FEHBA program.

16

Indeed, that is why, when Congress first enacted the

17

provision, it specifically warned that the clause would

18

not preempt insurers from traditional State laws

19

governing insurance.

20

That instruction remains true today.

Reading FEHBA's express-preemption clause

21

narrowly here so that subrogation contract terms do not

22

preempt otherwise applicable State law honors Congress's

23

intent and accords respect for the States as independent

24

sovereigns in their historic role in governing matters

25

of insurance and tort law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does the -- does the

statute 8902(m)(1), does it preempt anything?

3

MR. WESSLER:

Well, we think that the

4

statute is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause,

5

and so, as written, it has -- it should have no effect.

6

I think if you carve that out for -- for one second, I

7

think what Your Honor is asking is are there a subset of

8

laws that Congress was attempting to displace by virtue

9

of these contract terms, and I think the answer to that

10

is yes and you can get that from the legislative

11

history.

12

There were -- I think, just to back up for a

13

second, when Congress first passed FEHBA in 1959, it did

14

not attempt to enact a uniform area of Federal law.

15

you -- you know this because what Congress said when it

16

first passed the law was, there's a problem with Federal

17

workers.

18

benefits packages that those in the private sector do;

19

we want to create a competitive way to allow that to

20

entice them to work for the government.

21

had a problem, because the government wasn't

22

administering any sort of serious health program.

23

so what they chose to do was to tap into the private

24

market.

25

And

They don't have the same competitive Federal

But they also

And

They -- they explicitly said, we don't have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

the expertise to administer this program.

2

act as a market participant and buy these plans from

3

private insurers who are doing business in the States.

4

And so from its inception, the FEHBA program was a

5

dual-regulatory scheme.

6

their insurance laws to govern those participant --

7

those private insurers who are participating in the

8

program.

9

We'd like to

Congress intended States and

Now, in the '70s what happened was that a

10

number of the carriers and the agency administering the

11

program, which was then at the time called CSC, found

12

that there were a number of States that had begun to

13

pass benefit laws; State laws that required, for

14

instance, a carrier to cover acupuncture services or

15

chiropractor services.

16

Congress and they said, these laws pose a problem.

17

need you to address this in some fashion.

18

what Congress did with 8902(m)(1), but it was very clear

19

in the legislative history at the time it passed this

20

statute in 1978, that it was purposely limited and not

21

intended to displace the State background insurance laws

22

that would apply to all of the carriers participating in

23

this program.

24
25

And the carriers went to

JUSTICE ALITO:

We

And that's

Before we get to the

legislative history, could you say something about the

terms of this provision?

2

of a sub -- of a subrogation -- of a contract that has a

3

subrogation provision do not relate to coverage?

4

do not relate to benefits, that they do not relate to

5

payment of benefits?

6

reach that conclusion?

7

Would you argue that the terms

They

Could you explain how you would

MR. WESSLER:

That's right, Your Honor.

8

That -- that, we think, is the best reading for three

9

reasons.

First, the -- it makes sense to distinguish

10

subrogation from benefits, because subrogation claims

11

involve the proceeds of a distinct and separate tort

12

cause of action that happens distinct in time and is

13

highly contingent.

14

affect at all any payment for a benefit or a coverage

15

that a Federal worker might receive --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

It doesn't involve any -- it doesn't

It doesn't -- it doesn't

affect the benefits that the participant receives?

18

MR. WESSLER:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's right.
If -- if it -- if there's no

20

subrogation claim, the benefit receives a certain

21

amount.

22

requirement of subrogation, the participant receives

23

that amount minus X?

24
25

If there is a potential, it's -- if there's

MR. WESSLER:
right, Your Honor.

I don't think that's quite

They get the MR -- a Federal worker,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

let's say, who needs coverage for an MRI, gets -- gets

2

that MRI covered and gets the coverage for that MRI paid

3

for by her insurance plan regardless of any subrogation

4

claim.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. WESSLER:

Right.
Because that claim is

7

necessarily contingent, it may never occur.

8

the money that -- that ultimately is involved in a

9

subrogation claim isn't the money that is getting paid

And -- and

10

for, for the MRI coverage.

11

a separate -- the proceeds of a separate tort claim from

12

a personal injury action.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's money that comes out of

But money is money, and, you

14

know, one dollar is as good as the next.

15

question is -- I think what Justice Alito is saying;

16

I'll just say it my way -- is one way -- say you're in a

17

car accident.

18

medical costs that you incur, and the other way you get

19

those costs minus any recovery in a tort suit.

20

a recovery won't happen in a tort suit, but a recovery

21

might happen in a tort suit and then you get

22

considerably less.

23

And the

One way you get all the hospital and

MR. WESSLER:

So maybe

Well, I think -- I think that

24

that is certainly possible, although I do think the

25

money matters.

These are historically equitable claims

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

and the pots of money and the differences about from

2

where those monies come matters in the way you conceive,

3

at the outset, of what a benefit is and whether that

4

benefit will be covered.

5

But I also think that part of understanding

6

how to interpret the text of the statute requires

7

understanding what Congress intended when it passed it

8

in the first place.

9

that Congress was distinctly concerned with these kind

And I think the purpose here is

10

of front-end benefit laws that made it difficult for

11

carriers to know and provide for the coverage that they

12

wanted and not to be required to cover for Arizona's

13

acupuncture doctors' benefits and services that weren't

14

offered under, for instance, a Blue Cross/Blue Shield

15

plan.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

The point is, is your

point.

18

subrogation.

19

nothing to do with benefits.

20

the money, you get the CAT scan.

21

get the hospital payment, you get the pain and suffering

22

or whatever, you -- you're covered.

23

Look, what we're talking about here is
Has nothing to do with coverage.

It has

You're covered, you

in the world.

25

the proceeds of that tort suit.

And our law affects

Official - Subject to Final Review

tort suit are not benefits.

2

3

are some money that our State and a judge decided should

4

be paid to a victim of an accident.

The proceeds of that tort

The proceeds of that tort suit

5

MR. WESSLER:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that the point?

That's correct, Your Honor.
Well, if that's the point,

7

then what about payments with respect to benefits?

8

The -- the sub -- those payments are not even with

9

respect to benefits?

10

MR. WESSLER:

Again, I don't think that's

11

the best reading of the statute for largely the reasons

12

that Justice Breyer gave.

13

payment of those benefits contemplates a front-end

14

question about whether you are getting your MRI covered

15

by the plan, not whether many years down the road there

16

is some additional extra pot of money that is then

17

available to be shared among a number of different

18

entities.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- the benefits and the

But the question isn't

20

whether it's benefits; it's whether it relates to

21

benefits, and not even whether it relates to benefits,

22

whether it relates to payments with respect to benefits.

23

MR. WESSLER:

I -- I -- yes.

I think that's

24

-- that's certainly right, but I think relates to,

25

again, is -- is context-dependent in this -- in this --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

for this statute as it is for every other statute.

2

And Congress had a laser focus when it

3

passed this statute in 1978.

4

otherwise applicable State insurance laws.

5

reason it didn't want to disturb those laws is because

6

it understood that the private carriers that were

7

participating in this program should be governed by the

8

same laws that would govern anybody in the private

9

sector when it comes to insurance.

10

It did not want to disturb
And the

And that's why this distinction, I think, is

11

a false one between a employer -- an employee in -- in

12

Missouri and an employee in Kansas getting different

13

rights because their State laws are different.

14

precisely the kind of differences that Congress wanted

15

to ensure controlled in the FEHB program.

16

That is

I -- I think also, you know, what this

17

points up, Justice Alito, is that there is, I think,

18

this textual ambiguity that certainly can be read, based

19

on just a -- a pure matter of --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is no ambiguity.

The

21

answer to the point, if I got the point right, is you

22

say, you know, it's sort of like a lottery or something.

23

There's some money floating out there.

24

contract says, different from what the State law says,

25

is that money that's floating out there, maybe you won

Alderson Reporting Company

And what the

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

it in a lottery or it came from Mars as far as this

2

receiving benefits is concerned by the patient, but this

3

contract says you take that money that came from Mars or

4

wherever and you pay it to the insurance company.

5

Why do you pay it to the insurance company?

6

MR. WESSLER:

7
8
9
10
11
12
13

Well, I think -- I mean, I

think -JUSTICE BREYER:

Because what is it that the

insurance company did that entitles them to receive that
money from Mars?

What is it that they did?

MR. WESSLER:

Well, they -- they included in

their contract this requirement -JUSTICE BREYER:

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I mean,

14

just very simply, in three words, what did they do that

15

entitled them to money from Mars?

16

MR. WESSLER:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Now, it relates to benefits because they get

19

the money from this separate thing that happened because

20

they paid benefits.

21

contract does not relate to benefits?

22

MR. WESSLER:

Sure.

They paid the benefits.

Exactly.

So there we are.

So now how do you say that this

Well, Your Honor, I think,

23

again, the question is -- is largely what did Congress

24

intend when it passed this statute.

25

"relates to" could be read uncritically broadly, or it

Alderson Reporting Company

The question --

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

could be read narrowly, and -- and the -- the proper

2

approach, I think, as this Court has explained in

3

multiple different contexts, is to ask what did Congress

4

intend when it passed this particular express-preemption

5

clause.

6

create an expansive form of preemption that could extend

7

to cover laws that would fall within traditional areas

8

of State insurance regulations.

And here, we know that their goal was not to

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

MR. WESSLER:

How do we know that?
They said in the legislative

11

history, it is purposely limited and not intended to

12

displace otherwise applicable State insurance law.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

You know, our colleague

14

Justice Scalia, is not here any longer, but he would be

15

having a fit at this point, so maybe --

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. WESSLER:

Sure.

I -- I understand, Your

18

Honor.

19

the lessons in McVeigh is that there is this textual

20

ambiguity that arises from precisely this colloquy that

21

we've had.

22

what does the Court do in the face of this textual

23

ambiguity when we don't quite know what Congress may

24

have intended exactly.

25

But again, I think in McVeigh, what -- one of

And the question then becomes what does --

And in the area of traditional State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33

regulation, as we are in when it comes to insurance,

2

there's a -- when we're talking about State laws and

3

whether Congress intended to displace those State laws,

4

we require a clear statement from Congress before we

5

undo a category, wipe away --

language.

Well, I -Almost identical

And we read it very, very broadly.
MR. WESSLER:

Well, the critical

17

distinction, Your Honor, in Hillman, is that Hillman was

18

decided on an implied form of preemption.

19

said -- life insurance statute at issue there, including

20

an express-preemption clause, but the Court didn't --

21

didn't address the effect or meaning of that clause at

22

all and instead looked to the -- to the statutory

23

language and the regulations that the agency promulgated

24

and found that -- a Virginia State law that would have

25

required something else other than what the -- the

Alderson Reporting Company

The Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

statute required was in conflict.

2

Now we think implied preemption --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Why -- why isn't there a

conflict here?

5

MR. WESSLER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We -- we think that there -There's a direct

7

conflict between what the benefits paid here demand --

8

it's benefits minus later subrogation -- and what the

9

State law says, which is you can't honor that

10

contractual term.

11

MR. WESSLER:

I -- sure.

So one thing to

12

say, first -- I'll answer your question, Your Honor, but

13

this is not an implied preemption case.

14

Neither the Petitioners nor the government

15

have argued that there is a conflict that has -- that

16

has been created that gives rise to a form of implied

17

preemption.

18

meaning of scope of this express-preemption clause.

19

Their argument is focused solely on the

Now, there could be, down the road, if the

20

government were to, in fact, enact a substantive

21

regulation, some form of implied conflict that could

22

give rise to the displacement of State law, but we're

23

not in that world in this case today.

24
25

And I think that's actually a crucial point
that -- that what we have here is the challengers are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

asking for what is, in essence, an unprecedented

2

expansion of Chevron at the same time while trying to

3

smuggle in insurance laws through express-preemption

4

clause, when they have available to them the possibility

5

of arguing, as in Hillman, an implied form of preemption

6

that would still allow the Court to do the -- the --

7

the -- to make the decision about whether there's indeed

8

an irreconcilable conflict.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -- but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so I do.

10

That -- that

11

gives me whip -- whiplash.

12

have implied preemption, and that's the -- the preferred

13

argument to express preemption?

14

other way around.

15

MR. WESSLER:

All of a sudden you -- you

It should be just the

Well, I think, Your Honor,

16

that is what happened in Hillman v. Maretta.

17

was an express-preemption clause like there was here,

18

but the Court, you know, instead of considering whether

19

that express-preemption clause displaced Virginia law,

20

adopted a form of implied preemption to decide whether

21

there was a conflict.

22

substantive regulation --

23

And there

But we don't have here a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it just seems to me

24

as orderly proceeding for us to ask the first question:

25

Is there express preemption?

And that displaces the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

whole necessity for going through the very difficult

2

exercise of implied preemption.

3

MR. WESSLER:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

has some priority.

6

Well, I -You seem to indicate it

That was my only comment.

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I don't -- I don't

7

know -- I wouldn't -- I don't think there's necessarily

8

a priority, but I don't think the express-preemption

9

clause in this case can bear the weight of the

10

interpretation that the challenger is --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Well, that's quite another

thing.

13

MR. WESSLER:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- trying to place on it.
But, for example, just a

15

couple of years ago, we said with respect to an

16

express-preemption clause, we said that the presumption

17

against preemption just didn't apply in a case like

18

this -- like that; that it was only applicable in a case

19

of implied preemption.

20

MR. WESSLER:

Right.

I -- well, I don't

21

think this Court has overruled the 70 years of -- of

22

precedent establishing that the presumption against

23

preemption applies to express-preemption clauses.

24

think --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I

So that was just a careless

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

statement --

2

MR. WESSLER:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

MR. WESSLER:

No.

I think that --

-- on our part?
I think in that case, the

5

point the Court was making was that where the language

6

of an express-preemption clause is clear, where we know

7

that Congress intended to displace a -- a particular

8

State law, the presumption does not need to apply.

9

I think that's perfectly consistent with an

And

10

interpretation here, that where the text is ambiguous,

11

where we do not have a clear statement from Congress

12

that it intended to displace some particular area of

13

State law, that we would -- we would exercise caution

14

and not cavalierly displace that State law unless and

15

until Congress makes that intent clear.

16

I'd like, if I can, to just turn to

17

Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts' question that he posed

18

to the challengers about the very odd nature of this

19

express-preemption clause, because I do think it raises

20

some very serious constitutional problems that -- that

21

if -- if this Court were to adopt the challengers'

22

interpretation, would -- would allow these contract

23

terms to really do the displacing of State law.

24
25

And I do think that there is -- it would be
unprecedented -- Congress has never enacted another form

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

38
1

of this type of preemption that would actually authorize

2

the terms of privately-negotiated contracts to step in

3

and displace otherwise applicable sovereign decisions of

4

States.

5

And there really is no way around this

6

problem in the case, other than to adopt a narrow

7

interpretation of what the -- what relates to benefits

8

means, because Congress, when it wrote this statute in

9

1978, unambiguously intended to delegate the power to

10

preempt to these terms of contracts.

11

contracts are not laws under the Supremacy Clause.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

And these

Does your -- does your

13

argument depend on the wording of this provision?

14

it depend on the fact that it says the terms of the

15

contract shall supersede State or local law?

16

would you have a -- would you make the same argument if

17

it said this statute hereby supersedes and preempts any

18

State or local law that conflicts with the terms of the

19

contract?

20

MR. WESSLER:

Does

Would --

I think that is -- I think

21

that is a -- a far better approach that would -- would

22

likely not raise these problems, because it points back

23

to a -- a statute that actually does the preempting.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, boy, if you're willing

to concede that, I don't see what there is to your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

argument because that's, in essence, what this is --

2

what this is saying.

3

MR. WESSLER:

But the difference, Your

4

Honor, is that here the terms are -- the terms of these

5

contracts are determining the scope of preemption.

6

the terms themselves are not known by Congress at the

7

time it passes the law.

8

a lot more like what ERISA looks like where Congress

9

said the subchapters of ERISA preempt any State law that

And

What Your Honor suggested looks

10

might interfere with plans.

11

preemption analysis under ERISA, it refers back to

12

the -- to the actual substantive provisions in ERISA to

13

determine preemption.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

But when this Court does a

But Congress doesn't know

15

the term -- doesn't know what's in all these plans.

16

They didn't know what would be in all these plans when

17

they enacted it.

MR. WESSLER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that -It depends on the -- it --

on -- on the formulation.

22

that's -- that's a problem.

23

says, this statute hereby preempts anything that

24

conflicts with the contract, that's -- that's not a

25

problem?

If you say the contract

But if it -- this -- it

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WESSLER:

Well, it depends on what the

2

statute says.

3

it included a series of substantive provisions that

4

dictate which State laws are displaced.

5

it has reporting requirements.

6

requirements.

7

substantive provisions give force to the preemption of

8

State law.

9

And in ERISA, when Congress passed ERISA,

For instance,

It has disclosure

It has a remedial scheme.

All of those

Here, there isn't any of that.

All Congress

10

has said is we're -- we are authorizing these contract

11

terms sight unseen that are entered into by the

12

government, not acting as regulator, but acting as -- as

13

market participant, and the terms of those contracts are

14

able to other -- to displace otherwise applicable

15

sovereign State law.

16

And -- and there truly is no limiting

17

principle if, in fact, that is authorized under the

18

Supremacy Clause, because, as the Chief suggested, there

19

would be nothing to stop Congress from doing the same

20

thing for completely private contracts or the rules of

21

some informal body.

22

When -- when the Supremacy Clause speaks of

23

a law being capable of displacing the sovereign

24

decisions of States, it requires that there be some

25

accountability checkpoints, some procedural protections

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

that safeguard States from the kind of arbitrary

2

decision making that could occur through an informal

3

process where there's no public participation and no

4

judicial oversight.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think I don't quite

6

understand your -- your answer to Justice Alito's first

7

question.

8

the lines of this Federal law preempts and supersedes

9

any State law that conflicts with these kinds of

I think he gave you a statute something along

10

contracts.

11

your constitutional concerns; is that right?

12
13
14
15

And you said that would not be subject to

MR. WESSLER:

I may have misheard -- I may

have misheard Justice Alito.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because those contracts are

That's right.

And -- and the

19

key point, the one that I think might infect a -- would

20

infect that -- that hypothetical is that where the

21

contract terms themselves are determining the scope of

22

preemption, where they, the terms, are actually

23

requiring State law to yield, that is where I think

24

the -- the Supremacy Clause comes into play because

25

those contract terms themselves are not laws.

Alderson Reporting Company

They have

Official - Subject to Final Review

42

2

safeguards, procedural protections --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They come with no

Well, but that -- that,

4

again, is true of ERISA, too.

5

says this Federal law displaces these State laws because

6

they conflict with a bunch of contract terms.

7

MR. WESSLER:

ERISA is a statute that

Well, I think the difference

8

is that when this Court does -- when this Court

9

considers preemption in ERISA, the Court looks to the

10

substantive provisions of the statute.

11

instance, the remedial scheme.

12

remedial scheme in ERISA, and that substantive scheme

13

displaces a State common law claim.

14

true for a disclosure requirement.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

It looks to, for

It says there is this

The same would be

Doesn't -- doesn't specify

16

everything that's in -- in a State -- in a -- in a plan.

17

And things that are in a plan that are not required by

18

ERISA supersede State law; isn't that true?

19

MR. WESSLER:

That's true.

But what happens

20

then is you have Federal common law that comes in to

21

fill the gap.

22

23

And so the difference here is that you have

5

what is otherwise a State-focused area of law in which

6

these terms in Federal contracts that go through no

7

oversight, no public participation are being used to

8

deflect those State laws in a way in which Congress

9

itself does not have any control over.

10

And I think the Court ought be very careful

11

before wading in to whether, in fact, that is something

12

that is authorized under the Supremacy Clause.

13

think it's what motivated this Court in McVeigh to look

14

at this exact provision and express what is, I think, a

15

quite concerned view over whether there is the Supremacy

Clause problem.

contracts and have State law apply equally to both.

It seeks to put

What's going on here is a rule of

16

essentially priority in which -- which Congress has

17

delegated to these contract terms the power to override

18

State law and exist above what would otherwise apply

19

to -- in the private sector.

20

cuts strongly against what Congress intended when it

21

first passed FEHBA, which was that this -- this statute

22

and the -- and the -- and the insurance policies that

23

are offered to Federal workers who are also State

24

citizens should be subject to the State insurance

25

regimes that have controlled these carriers from day one

And I think that actually

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

2

in the private sector.
And when Congress has been asked to address

3

specific problems in this area, it has reacted and

4

responded repeatedly.

5

here, OPM, has not done, as much as it's tried to argue

6

for Chevron deference over an express -- its

7

interpretation of an express-preemption clause, it has

8

never, in fact, asked Congress to amend this law to

9

address what it perceives as a problem.

The one thing that this agency

10

And I would point the Court in this -- in

11

this respect to the way preemption works under the --

12

the Department of Defense insurance regime.

13

all of the -- again, the challengers pointing to several

14

copycat versions of this statute and several of their

15

other insurance regimes, the Department of Defense

16

insurance regime looks very different.

17

Because for

What Congress did there is that it first

18

enacted an express-preemption clause that looked nearly

19

identical to what the Court has in front of it here.

20

And then five years later, it amended that law and it

21

delegated the power to preempt not to terms of a

22

contract, but to regulations promulgated by a Federal

23

agency; there, the Secretary of Defense.

24
25

And I think if we're thinking about the
democratically accountable ways that preemption should

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

work and the protections that States must have for their

2

own law, allowing either Congress to do the preempting

3

or delegating that power specifically and expressly to

4

an agency are the only two ways that we can -- that

5

are -- that are constitutionally permissible, and here

6

we have neither.

7

Congress itself does not control the terms

8

of these contracts, and it has not expressly delegated

9

any authority to the agency to pronounce on preemption.

10

And so the agency's effort to seek Chevron deference

11

over what is explicitly a conclusion on the scope of an

12

express-preemption clause just doesn't work.

13

well knows how, when it wants to, to delegate that power

14

to the agency, and it has not done so here.

15
16

If there are no further questions, save the
rest of my time.

MR. ESTRADA:

I'd like to start with the last point

highlights one of the many oddities of the case on the

other side.

2

Under this Court's ruling in De la Cuesta,

3

which held -- you know, this Court held that an agency

4

may use general rulemaking authority to preempt State

5

laws, and in those circumstances, of course, their

6

regulations get deference.

7

And one of the contentions that this Court

8

specifically rejected in De la Cuesta was that in order

9

for the agency to use general rulemaking, Congress had

10

specifically to specify that the power to preempt was

That is at page 154 of this Court's

The case is cited in page 54 of the blue

14

It's very odd, therefore, that, under the

conception that Respondent has, the agency could have

16

done this conclusion on its own under its general

17

regulatory power under 8913, and yet Congress cannot do

18

so by expressly provided that this is the conclusion it

19

wants.

20

The second point I would like to make is

that -- one that addresses Justice Breyer's point, which

is, keep in mind that this is not a fight as to who gets

you recognize in City of Arlington, the choice that is

being proposed is not between Congress or the agency,

12

but between the Federal courts, which are certainly

13

unelected and generally unaccountable in the democratic

14

process and people that, at least in theory, are

15

ultimately accountable to the elected representatives,

16

that is to say, an agency.

17

And finally, to the extent that you believe

18

that this statute has a constitutional doubt in the

19

terms in which it was drafted, I can well believe that
