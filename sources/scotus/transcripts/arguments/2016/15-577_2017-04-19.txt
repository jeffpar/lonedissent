ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CORTMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The State of Missouri has excluded The

12

Learning Center from a recycling program that provides a

13

safer playground for children solely because the

14

preschool is operated by a church rather than a secular

15

not-for-profit.

16

The State has made several important

17

concessions in this case.

18

in this case is not facially neutral, and number two,

19

that based on their religious character, churches are

20

not eligible for the benefit here.

21

Number one, that the policy

This admitted discrimination against

22

religion violates this Court's Free Exercise Principles.

23

First, as stated in McDaniel and Smith, the Free

24

Exercise Clause prevents the government from imposing

25

special disabilities on the basis of religious views or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

religious status, and forcing a choice between the

2

exercise of religion and receiving either a government

3

benefit, right, or privilege.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Assuming that there's no

5

serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off

6

the table, are there ever instances in which status --

7

religious status can be used to deny religions or

8

religious believers benefits from the State?

9

saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause

10

problem, that status can never be the base -- religious

11

status can never be the basis for a governmental action

12

or governmental ordinance, governmental statute?

13

MR. CORTMAN:

Or are you

I -- I'm not sure if it can

14

be.

15

reason I say that is, the question is, is why would

16

someone's religious status matter in the first place to

17

receiving a government benefit?

I can't think of a specific example.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the

And that's another -On that -- on that

19

question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson

20

case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms

21

what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to

22

pay for building or maintaining churches or church

23

property.

24

is Everson pass√©?

25

And doesn't that fit this case?

MR. CORTMAN:

And if so,

I don't think it does.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Everson also said that we have to be careful in not

2

establishing a church not to deprive religious people or

3

organizations of general government benefits.

4

think that's the key here.

5

between funding of religious activities and funding

6

secular activities of religious organization.

7

And so I

I think there's a difference

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I --

So how is the building

8

separate from the religious exercise therein?

9

that this playground is part of the ministry of this

I believe

10

church.

11

its advertisements, and it includes play and conducted

12

in a religiously valuable way.

13

materials that you're -- that the church is advertising.

14

How do you separate out its secular function

15

And, in fact, I look at its bylaws, I look at

I think that's the

from its religious function?

16

MR. CORTMAN:

I think the way the Court

17

always has.

18

even though the motivation behind operating this

19

preschool is a religious motivation, doesn't mean that

20

every single activity that occurs there happens to be

21

religious.

22
23

And the answer to that is, for example,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how about if the

school does a prayer before the children start playing?

24

MR. CORTMAN:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't think -Or how about if it

2

without then controlling on the -- on the basis of

4

belief and viewpoint?

that involvement?

How does the State know or how can it control

How could they control against

10

Sure.

It's the same way it

And that is, is we have to
What's it going to

And in this particular instance, for

11

example, if you look at the -- this Court's case law

12

going back from Everson and all the way forward, it

13

always said is the money going to a religious activity

14

or is it going to a secular activity?

15

This Court has approved funding to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. CORTMAN:

But --- religious schools, just not

for religious activities.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So do you think,

Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a --

21

from a -- a church that used its playground for

religious activities.

was a significantly different case?

That they -- I'm sorry.

They don't think they should --

MR. CORTMAN:

They should be able to deny it

8

on that ground.

9

we're talking about is a -- is a surface, a safer

And the reason I say that is, is all

10

surface on the playground for when -- when kids play.

11

As was mentioned in one of the amicus briefs, I believe

12

it was the World Vision brief, the surfacing being

13

softer doesn't enable religious activities, it doesn't

14

allow it, it doesn't prohibit it.

15

completely separate and apart from it.

16
17

It's really

And I think a good example would be
something like this --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How would you -- for

19

example, one of the things that the Court has -- has

20

thought about in the past is like computers for

21

education.

22

argument about computers.

23

it's separate from the religious instruction that might

24

be carried out over those computers.

25

So I guess somebody could make the same
Well, it doesn't really --

Do you think that that's the same, or is it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8

different?

2

MR. CORTMAN:

I -- I think it's actually

3

easier than computers because you don't have to get into

4

diversion and all the -- the concept this Court has

5

talked about over the -- over the years in the Mitchell

6

case and the other types of cases.

7

And here the reason is, is that what we're

8

talking about is just a surface.

9

entire playground.

10

It's not even the

It's just the surface that doesn't

enable any religious activity.

11

So, for example, if there was a program from

12

a State that said we have a lot of old buildings in

13

town, and we're going to -- we're going to reimburse for

14

fire extinguishers for all of the old buildings,

15

including the religious schools and all the schools.

16

And they said, but if -- if you have a religious school

17

and you use this fire extinguisher reimbursement, could

18

they then be able to say now that you received that --

19

that public benefit, that safety benefit, you can no

20

longer include any religion in those classrooms or in

21

the schools?

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't it the consequence of your argument

12

that the church can use the playground for more

religious activities if the public school can use the

14

playground for other non-playground activities?

15

MR. CORTMAN:

MR. CORTMAN:

I think they should be able

20

to -- I think both the public schools should be able to

21

use it for other activities, and I think that the

22

religious schools should be able to also.

23

And -- and as I mentioned, I think the

24

reason for that is it would be a penalty on the benefit

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do we do with

discrimination for religion under your theory?

14

the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of

15

McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of

McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular

MR. CORTMAN:

Establishment Clause.

Sure.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

people who would think tax exemption goes too far.

religion, there's an Establishment Clause problem; but

15

if you go the other side on the Free Exercise Clause,

16

this Court has said for decades, sometimes we may and

17

even must accommodate religion, and I think is the

18

favorable treatment that Your Honor is talking about.

19

But I think all the clauses work together in that route.

20

If you take it too far, you do have an Establishment

21

Clause problem.

And so on one side you have the

unconstitutional.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in this particular

And Mr. Cortman, I don't

know whether we -- excuse me.

8

need to get into the history of this particular

9

amendment here.

I don't know whether we

I tend to think we don't need to, but

10

at the beginning of the line of questioning that Justice

11

Sotomayor just finished, she began with the suggestion

12

that perhaps this amendment reflects an admirable

13

historical tradition that should be respected.

14
15

Do you think that that is the proper way to
analyze this question?

16

MR. CORTMAN:

I don't.

And -- and this --

17

this particular provision that we're discussing, they

18

are -- and this has been briefed by several amicus

19

briefs and -- and briefly by us, is a product of what we

20

would consider to be one of the Blaine Amendments that

21

was not found in Locke v. Davey.

22

that is, is it has that same language in the Blaine

23

Amendment.

24

there is much history showing about the anti-Catholic

25

bigotry that's behind this specific provision, and

And the reason for

before.

as -- as this general Establishment Clause, not --

So I think it doesn't carry the same history

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is a serious

debate about that, isn't there?

6

MR. CORTMAN:

There is.

And that's why our

7

argument is, is we believe it is one, but it -- it

8

doesn't matter to the deciding of this case.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Has the -- has the -- the

10

State courts, have they ever said the amendment prevents

11

the State from giving grants or from spending money on

12

police protection for churches?

MR. CORTMAN:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

They -- they have not, and -Have they ever said that it

it could happen, somebody brings the case in the Supreme

MR. CORTMAN:

that injunction, whether you want it or not, with the

the best two cases are Friends of the Earth and the Knox

MR. CORTMAN:

Fine.

That would be a factor in our

This case would have to be

here, I guess, in a different posture, maybe coming from

the other side, if that was already the policy.

23

one of the problems is, is that the original policy was

I think

So what's interesting here is there's

And -- but I think what's likely to happen

11

under the Voluntary Cessation Doctrine, especially as

12

this Court has said, we look at this with a -- a

13

critical eye because of the 11th hour change, is the

14

State free to return to its old ways?

15

not only in this administration, but in the new lawsuit

16

being brought to challenge the new policy, because it

17

violates why we're here in the first place, is the

18

Missouri State constitutional provision.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It clearly is,

May I take you back to the

20

substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's

21

talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I

22

would like to know.

23

funding cases, it comes in a different context.

24

comes where the State wants to give money and somebody

25

is objecting.

You know, usually when we see these
It

And this case comes in the converse way,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

where a State says we just don't want to fund --

2

MR. CORTMAN:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
-- this institution.

And

4

these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a

5

fraught issue.

6

issue in which States have their own very longstanding

7

law.

8

say nobody is completely sure that they have it right.

9

And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about

10

having some play in the joints where States can go their

11

own way and make their own choices.

12

this be one of those cases?

13

It's a hard issue.

It's a -- it's an

It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to

MR. CORTMAN:

And why shouldn't

Because I don't think this is

14

one of the difficult cases.

15

all the Court's jurisprudence under Free Exercise and

16

Establishment Clause, this is actually one of the easier

17

cases.

18

play in joints, the first conclusion was there was no

19

Free Exercise violation there.

20

If you look at the Court's case law under Sherbert and

21

McDaniel and McCauley and Smith, this is clearly

22

singling out a religious organization with no

23

justification to do so.

24

violation takes it out of the play in the joints where

25

there wasn't one there.

In fact, I would say, with

And the reason for that is if you look at the

Here, there clearly is.

So just having a Free Exercise

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

I think the other thing is, if you're
looking at the --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's, of course,

4

true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at

5

stake, that trumps.

6

going to interpret the constitutional right?

7

we -- so -- so I guess what I'm asking is, do you see

8

value in the other side in having some flexibility here

9

for States to make these sorts of choices?

10

But the question is, how are we

MR. CORTMAN:

What are

I think States have tremendous

11

leeway in the way they set up and decide these types of

12

programs.

13

an easy solution.

14

set up the program in the first place.

15

could set it up in a way that said, we're only going to

16

do government schools' playgrounds and not any private

17

schools.

And here's what I would say, which I think is
Number one, the State doesn't have to
Number two, it

18

But once it sets up the program to include

19

all not-for-profits and all not-for-profit preschools,

20

it sets out 16 different criteria, neutral criteria,

21

that everyone has to comply with.

22

is -- when you have a -- a religious organization that

23

meets those criteria; in fact, does better on them than

24

almost everybody else, and then you look at the

25

application and say, well, we just found out you're

Then the question is,

1

operated by a religious organization, we're going to

2

take you back out of that, even though you meet the

3

State's criteria and further our interest better than

4

almost everybody else, that seems to be not a

5

difficult --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But one last -- I know your

white light is on.

here's the problem.

in with a very competitive application.

But might the State think that

12

Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens

13

five years running.

14

why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the

15

money and the Catholic church never gets the money?

16

the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that

17

kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of --

18

well, that --

19

Let's say, you know, a Protestant

There's a Catholic church across the street.

It sounds like a -- a

reasonable observer question, but put that aside for a

21

second.

22

program, you would know that this is a competitive

23

grant, and they actually should be religion blind.

If you know the history and context of the

So if you're not looking at who is applying,

25

you can grade this just like this application was graded

highly, based on secular and neutral criteria.

2

anyone knows that the program is purely religion blind,

3

not looking at who's applying, they'll know that it's

4

not favoring any religious organization or secular.

So

5

But what you do when you favor -- when you

6

remove the religious organizations, even though you've

7

scored them high under your own competition, you're

8

actually singling out for -- for a benefit they should

otherwise get under Free Exercise.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16

MR. LAYTON:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

Justice Alito asked the question as to

18

whether this is an admirable tradition that should be

19

respected, this 39-State tradition of have -- keeping

20

hands off of religion, and the answer from the States'

21

view is yes.

22

In 1820, Missouri's first constitutional

23

convention adopted from Jefferson's Virginia Statute for

24

Religious Freedom the language that, "No man can be

25

compelled to erect, support, or attend any place of

Alderson Reporting Company

worship."

2

We modified that, made it more specific in

3

the 1865 and 1875 constitutions.

4

reenacted in our latest constitution with reference back

5

to the founding era.

And in 1945, it was

6

The -- the question, then, is whether that

7

fits within this Court's jurisprudence under the First

8

Amendment.

9

Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, and the play

And there we look at both the Establishment

10

between the joints that this Court confirmed or

11

recognized in Locke v. Davey.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you don't want

13

us -- you say we don't have to look at the Establishment

14

Clause.

16

In your brief, you said there's no

MR. LAYTON:

No.

17

not an Establishment Clause violation.

Clause.

there's not a violation.

And those concerns arise both

Alderson Reporting Company

31

with regard to endorsement and with regard to

2

entanglement.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is it your argument

4

that this statute is valid to keep us away from close

5

Establishment Clause questions?

6

MR. LAYTON:

Yes.

Yes.

We don't want to be

7

in a position, for example, in this case, where we are

8

selecting among churches.

9

position where we are making a visible, physical

10
11

We don't want to be in a

improvement on church property.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but this -- this is

12

quite different than Locke, because this is a

13

status-based statute.

14

MR. LAYTON:

Well, in -- in that respect, it

15

is different.

16

For example, in that case, we have independent

17

decisionmaking, which has been key to many of this

18

Court's decisions.

19

not by some third party, it is by the State.

20

In other respects it's different as well.

In this Court, the decisionmaking is

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Layton, you said

21

you don't want to -- you don't want to have a program

22

that makes physical improvements to -- to churches.

23

I just wanted to ask you about some Federal laws that

24

are highlighted in the amicus brief filed by the Union

25

of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and get your reaction

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

32

whether a program like that would be permissible under

2

the Missouri constitution.

3

So one of them is a Federal nonprofit

4

security grant program providing grants through the

5

Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden

6

nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be

7

at high risk for terrorist attacks.

8

a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an

9

anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be

So if you have a --

10

at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would

11

the Missouri constitution permit the erection of

12

bollards like we have around the court here?

13

MR. LAYTON:

The answer traditionally -- and

14

I'm not sure that I can speak for the current

15

governor -- of course, I was brought back to argue this

16

case and instructed I could defend the prior position,

17

but the answer traditionally would be no.

18

could not be used to actually erect or -- or operate or

19

provide that kind of physical addition to a -- to a

20

church or synagogue.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

I have two more, if you'll indulge me.

Okay.

State money

Here's another one.

23

This is a Federal program that provided

24

grants for the repair of buildings near the Federal

25

building in Oklahoma City that were damaged by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

bombing there.

2

Would that be permitted?

MR. LAYTON:

Under the traditional view of

3

-- in the State of Missouri, it would not be permitted,

4

provided that those were actually church buildings.

5

Worship buildings.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Last one.

This is a

7

New York City program that provides security -- money

8

for security enhancements at schools where there's fear

9

of shooting or other school violence.

10

MR. LAYTON:

Again, under the traditional

11

view in Missouri, if -- if this was actually a cash

12

grant, money leaving the public treasury to go to a

13

church, it would not be permissible.

14

Now, that doesn't mean that a

15

religious-affiliated school could not qualify.

16

St. Louis University case by the Missouri Supreme Court

17

shows that the Missouri courts have been willing to draw

18

the definition of churches and religious institutions

19

pretty narrowly.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

So what is the definition of

21

a church?

22

church under the -- under the Missouri constitution?

23

So a religiously-affiliated school is not a

MR. LAYTON:

The decision with regard to

24

St. Louis University was that even though it is a Jesuit

25

institution that is founded by Jesuits, had a Jesuit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

president and Jesuits on its board, since it had a

2

self-perpetuating board, even though it declared a -- a

3

Jesuit philosophy, it was determined to be eligible to

4

receive -- in that instance not direct payment from the

5

State, but eligible to receive State funds.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Layton --

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would that be so?

9

MR. LAYTON:

I suspect because the Missouri

10

courts are trying to provide as much assistance as they

11

can within the realm that they feel that the Missouri

12

constitution permits.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Oh.

So suppose you -- we

14

have the -- a school that's run by the Trinity Lutheran

15

Church of Columbia.

16

Jesuit elementary and secondary school.

17

eligible, one would not be eligible?

18

MR. LAYTON:

And then next to it we have a -- a
One would be

It would depend on the nature

19

of the two.

20

to the position it was in in 1985 where the preschool

21

was an independent, although somewhat affiliated, entity

22

using the church's facilities, presumably under some

23

kind of a lease arrangement, the State likely would have

24

said yes, because that would be consistent --

25

In fact, if the Trinity Lutheran went back

But even though they're

MR. LAYTON:

No.

I don't think -- I -- it

3

would be a fine line in terms of the control.

4

if the organization itself, the church itself rather

5

than the self-perpetuating board, such as with St. Louis

6

University, controlled the -- the preschool, that --

7

that is what has made the difference in Missouri in the

past, although understand, we have very few cases in

(Laughter.)

MR. LAYTON:

25

Nothing to do

Okay?
MR. LAYTON:

24

Okay?

But as soon as you answer that, I'll be

Same

So what -- what are you asking

first?
JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm asking --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm asking, does the

3

Constitution of the United States permit a State or a

4

city to say, we give everybody in this city police

5

protection, but not churches?

6

protection, but let the church burn down.

7

everybody public health protection, but not a church.

8

That's -- that's the law in my imaginary State.

9
10

guarantees free exercise of religion, permit such laws?
MR. LAYTON:

I -- I am not going to take the

position that it permits those laws --

13
14

We give

And I'm saying, does the Constitution, which

11
12

We give everybody fire

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

it does not permit those laws.

15

Now you say no,

Very well.

If it does not permit a law that pays money

16

out of the treasury for the health of the children in

17

the church, school, or even going to church, how does it

18

permit Missouri to deny money to the same place for

19

helping children not fall in the playground, cut their

20

knees, get tetanus, break a leg, et cetera?

21

difference?

22

MR. LAYTON:

What's the

The difference is that the

23

establishment concerns that motivate Missouri's policy

24

do not apply in the police and fire context, but they

25

apply here.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why in health context?

So

if there's --

3

MR. LAYTON:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. LAYTON:

No.
-- an epidemic?

No, I don't know that they

6

apply in health context.

7

Your Honor is giving are examples where the -- the

8

benefits are universal.

9

they are here; they are universal.

10

Because the kind of examples

They are not selective, which

So we start on the endorsement side.

In

11

those instances, the State is not endorsing a particular

12

church by choosing to provide that church with those

13

benefits and not another church, which is --

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Layton, I understand

that --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Establishment

17

Clause -- the -- the entire basis for your rule is that

18

you're afraid of violating the Establishment Clause,

19

even though you're sure there's no violation of the

20

Establishment Clause?

21

MR. LAYTON:

No.

I -- it -- it is that we

22

do not want to come to the edge of violating the

23

Establishment Clause.

24

position that we would by doing this, but the

25

question --

I mean, we are not taking the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

position that it is not, that this is not a violation --

3

MR. LAYTON:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

No, you take the

It is not a violation.
-- Establishment

Clause violation.

6

MR. LAYTON:

The question is, do we have to

7

come all the way to the edge of a violation, which is

8

what I think Petitioners are arguing.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

MR. LAYTON:

Yeah, I --

But it -- that it -- that as

long as we aren't violating, there is no room between.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Layton, let's say

13

I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in

saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to

15

one church and not another in these selective programs.

MR. LAYTON:
side.

And that's the endorsement

There's also entanglement.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20
21

Yes.

I --

I -- I think that that's

legitimate.
But here's the thing.

There's a

22

constitutional principle.

23

constitutional principle that there is, that when we

24

have a program of funding -- and here we're funding

25

playground surfaces -- that everybody is entitled to

It's as strong as any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

that funding, to -- to that particular funding, whether

2

or not they exercise a constitutional right; in other

3

words, here, whether or not they are a religious

4

institution doing religious things.

5

using the money for playground services, you're not

6

disentitled from that program because you're a religious

7

institution doing religious things.

As long as you're

8

And I would have thought that that's a

9

pretty strong principle in our constitutional law.

10

how is that the State says that that's not violated

11

here?

12

MR. LAYTON:

And

Well, let me react to the way

13

that you set that out.

14

the rubber, then what Your Honor asks does make sense.

15

But the rubber doesn't have any meaning until it's

16

placed there and is available for use.

17

theory, we not only have to put rubber on playgrounds,

18

but don't we have to put new paint on the sanctuary if

19

the old one had lead paint?

20

pay -- reimburse for pews to be upholstered?

21

what -- what is the --

If we're only going to look at

Don't we have to put --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

under Locke, right?

And under this

I mean,

I think --- not under -- not

Locke drew a distinction between

MR. LAYTON:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It did.
So perhaps -- I

5

mean, maybe you'd have a good argument.

6

hand, maybe if you painted the interior of all sorts of

7

other buildings but singled out religious, I don't know.

8

But it seems to me that that's -- raises much more

9

serious problems than this case.

MR. LAYTON:

Or on the other

I don't think that Locke

problems than Locke in a number of respects.

that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

right that this is a selective program.

20

still the question is whether some people can be

21

disentitled from applying to that program and from

22

receiving that money if they are qualified based on

23

other completely nonreligious attributes, and they're

24

disqualified solely because they are a religious

willing to accept it, which they are here, is anathema

to the Establishment Clause considerations that have

13

highlighted many of these questions --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

You suggested two lines.

I'm back to my question --

16

MR. LAYTON:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

similar to what Justice Kagan is asking.

19

you accepted the first part of what I asked, you agree

20

there has to be a line.

21

MR. LAYTON:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- which is really quite
You -- once

Yes.
Now, one line you've

23

suggested is the question that you're selecting rather

24

than giving to any -- everyone.

25

MR. LAYTON:

Universal versus select.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

But would you say the same

2

case, were you to give the money to all schools instead

3

of just some by selection, then would be

4

unconstitutional barring churches?

5

would.

But wait.

6

I don't think you

Say the other line.

The other line, which I want you to

7

contrast, is that where there is a grant given to all

8

schools, private and public, and the purpose -- and that

9

grant has nothing to do with religious practice, but it

10

does -- has to do with health or safety.

11

to do it.

Then you have

What about that?

12

MR. LAYTON:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's -That's -- that's -- because

14

you win -- you lose -- or you win on the first; you lose

15

on the second.

16

MR. LAYTON:

17

That -- that is -Now, they are two competing

18

lines that I'm at least seeing.

19

others.

20

MR. LAYTON:

Maybe there's some

If the sole benefit to the

21

church and its members was health and safety and we

22

could draw that line, that may make some sense.

23

course, that's not true here.

24

that here.

25

church is actually a visible improvement in their

But, of

2

that declares in their petition that they use this

3

preschool to bring the gospel message to nonmembers.

4

This is --

5

And understand that this is a church

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's -- it's

6

not -- now your line is the benefit, if the benefit is

7

physical, that's okay; but if it's not, it's not?

8

MR. LAYTON:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

I'm saying -Well, what is your

10

issue?

11

is that it's the physical area near the church.

12

Your -- your answer said the -- the issue here

MR. LAYTON:

No.

I'm saying that -- that

13

even physical changes, even if they have a safety

14

element, may still have an entanglement problem.

15

Because we are saying to the church, you -- you have

16

this now incentive to rearrange your property, your

17

church site, in order to maximize the amount you get

18

from the State rather than maximizing the spiritual

19

development of the children.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you had a

21

program at the -- the State capital?

22

school groups, and you had someone who, you know,

23

coordinated, tied it into the social studies program;

24

school groups can come in, but no religious schools.

25

Is that okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

You had tours for

like that, and we --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have to have a

5

position.

6

answer the question whether or not you could prohibit

7

tours for religious schools while allowing tours for

8

other schools, I don't understand the basis of your

program -- your position.

Everyone who comes

And so --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. LAYTON:

Well --

-- we would be -- in terms of

15

universal versus selective, we would be in that same

16

range.

17

do not require the State to be entangled in any way with

18

the church and its ministry.

19

improvement here does require that, not just as to

20

curriculum, but as to the manner in which this is done,

21

and the way in which it is portrayed to the community.

22

That's the kind of entanglement that --

23
24
25

But also with regard to entanglement, the tours

And the playground

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what do you

mean, "the way it is portrayed to the community"?
MR. LAYTON:

Well, among other things, in --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

in this particular program, the church gets points for

2

telling people in the community that the State paid for

3

this improvement to their church.

4

essence, it -- it exacerbates the endorsement problem by

5

telling them what they have to say publicly about this

6

particular improvement.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so the -- in

I mean, you could say the

8

same thing, that -- that the church is delighted that it

9

has fire protection.

10
11

MR. LAYTON:

Well, I -- I suppose if we

said --

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. LAYTON:

-- we're only going to provide

14

fire protection to churches that will declare publicly

15

that they appreciate the States providing that, maybe;

16

but, again, that's not selective.

17

statement by the church has no meaning.

18

be perceived as an endorsement.

19

this church and this church has this beautiful new

20

playground surface that the State paid for, I am

21

receiving a message with regard to the State in this

22

particular regard.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so that -- that
It -- it can't

But when I drive past

And -- and so long as the

24

money is granted based on neutral criteria that are

25

faithfully applied, I don't know how you can draw a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

distinction between a program that's open to everybody

2

and a selective program.

3

I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full

4

college scholarships every year to students who achieved

5

certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain

6

academic criteria, and this was open to public school

7

students and private school students.

8

after a few years, the school saw -- the State saw that

9

a disproportionate number of these were going -- among

But, you know,

10

those given to the religiously affiliate, to the private

11

schools, a disproportionate were -- a number of the

12

scholarships were going to students at schools that are

13

affiliated with a particular faith.

14

Would it be, then, justified to say, well,

15

we better not -- we better disqualify every student who

16

went to a religiously affiliated school so there aren't

17

any hard feelings?

18

MR. LAYTON:

Well, I think that may be an

19

Equal Protection problem, because I don't know what

20

the -- the basis for that would be.

21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

between that situation and this situation --

23

MR. LAYTON:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

So what's the difference

Well, here, it's --- as far as the difference

between selective and nonselective?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

MR. LAYTON:

If we're going to deal with the

2

Equal Protection approach to this, then the question

3

becomes whether our endorsement and entanglement

4

concerns are a rational basis.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

I'm not talking about

6

equal protection.

7

matters that this is selective as opposed to not

8

selective.

9

You -- you said there's -- that it

MR. LAYTON:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what is the basis for

11

drawing that distinction?

12

your asserted basis was it prevents the perception of

13

favoritism.

14

MR. LAYTON:

I thought that -- I thought

Yes, it -- it does.

Because

15

this is a very selective program, very few institutions

16

get it.

17

the example in Locke v. Davey, it is a publicly visible

18

manifest demonstration of State endorsement.

19

And unlike the scholarship example or, frankly,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I don't understand --

20

I -- I think I understand how the States' interests

21

might differ some, but essentially this is a program

22

open to everyone.

23

but everyone is open to compete on various neutral

24

terms, and you're depriving one set of actors from being

25

able to compete in the same way everybody else can

Happens to be a competitive program,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

compete because of their religious identification.

2

MR. LAYTON:

And that is what we are doing,

3

because we are concerned about the endorsement and

4

entanglement issues that arise in connection with this

5

type of a program.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

And those are

7

interests.

I don't mean to say that those are not valid

8

interests.

But it does seem as though this is a clear

9

burden -- looked at that way, this is a clear burden on

a constitutional right.

rise to an extremely high level.

14

MR. LAYTON:

And then your interests have to

Well, I don't know that I --

I -JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's a burden on

16

a certain religious status are being prevented from

competing in the same way everybody else is for a

neutral benefit.

19

MR. LAYTON:

Well, this -- this is -- it's

20

not like McDaniel where someone is being barred from

21

participating in -- in the life of the -- the community.

22

This is a -- kind of the opposite of that.

Mr. Cortman -- I'm

sorry.

5

Mr. Layton, I'm -- I'm -- I know the Court

6

is very grateful that you took up the request of the

7

Missouri Attorney General to defend the old position,

8

but I -- I am worried about the, if not the mootness,

9

the adversity in this case.

If the Attorney General is

10

in favor of the position that your adversary is taking,

11

isn't his appointment of you creating adversity that

12

doesn't exist?

13

MR. LAYTON:

Well, I don't know the answer

14

to that -- that, but let me -- let me give some of the

15

factual background here.

16

The Attorney General himself is recused

17

because he actually appears on one of the briefs on the

18

other side.

19

Acting Attorney General, and the Acting Attorney

20

General, at a time before governor -- the governor gave

his new instruction, asked me to defend the position,

believes that you're taking the right position.

Reading through the lines of the

MR. LAYTON:

So -- so let me talk about what

has happened and what -- what happens next.

6

After the governor did -- made his

7

announcement, the director, who is my client here, in

8

fact, put up on her website the 2017 application and

9

2017 instructions, in which she largely tracked the 2016

10

and prior ones, including 2012 that the Court has, but

11

eliminated all reference to churches, religious

12

instruction; all of those were eliminated.

13

That's all I know about what she intends to

14

do, because I don't represent her with regard to that

15

decision.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm asking a simple

17

question.

hasn't this case become mooted?
MR. LAYTON:

So let me -- let me tell you

what happens next if the director actually grants --

If she does, then under Missouri's liberal

you are violating the State constitution.

that four years from now, with a change of

16

administration, or at some point in the interim through

18

change back to the prior practice.

19

It's not a perfect fit compared to some of the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Layton, I'm struggling

20

still to understand Justice Kagan's question, the answer

21

to it.

22

How is it that discrimination on the basis

23

of religious exercise is better in selective government

24

programs than general programs, first?

25

And second, how do we tell the difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53

between the two, if that's the line we're going to draw?

2

The tours, isn't it selective based on who

can show up at the Capitol and afford to do that?

What do we do about

position that when we have a -- a -- a case where it is

a selective program that is publicly announced, publicly

11

visible, that that is different from these other kind of

12

programs.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

line between selective and general?

seem to play with that line forever.

Police, fire, and health, when

But you gave the crossing guard

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. LAYTON:

25

In areas that are critical,

like police, fire, health.

24

There are

Yeah, I --

-- and in Missouri, that's

not -- that's not universal.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course.

That's my

problem.

2

seem absolutely necessary for police protection, fire

3

protection, health of children.

4

irrelevant factor, whether they're just open to

5

everybody to apply and you automatically get it, or

6

whether you have criteria and are selected because you

7

have a limited amount of money.

8

that line the --

9
10

I can reproduce programs in the State that

MR. LAYTON:

Free Exercise?

12

out, so you can reply.

13

And you want to make

Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

And it seems like an

-- constitutional line on

I'm afraid of that one.

MR. LAYTON:

Now, I put that

Well, the -- and -- and the

14

answer would be that the line is some combination.

15

I -- I can't give you a bright line, because you're

16

rejecting the bright line that we have.

17

combination of the endorsement problems with

18

selectivity, and the entanglement problems that come

19

when we're dealing with grant programs that actually

20

affect the physical plant of a church and how that plant

21

is used in a preschool or otherwise.

And

Some kind of

22

There is no way for the State to comply with

23

the -- its determination, maybe the requirement, that we

24

police the use of the funds and what the funds here put

25

on there without becoming involved with the church.

There's a statement in the -- the

2

Appellant's brief that says that the church is told that

3

it can't participate in the life of the community, but

4

what Trinity wants is to have the community participate

5

in the life of the church.

6

kind of basic doctrines that we get out of the founding

7

era that provided for a division --

8
9
10

And that is anathema to the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Imagine, why would it be

on the basis of a physical plant, as opposed to, say,
personnel or nonphysical grant money?

11

MR. LAYTON:

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Why -- why wouldn't what be?
Now the line is moving.

13

Now it's apparently on the basis of whether we're

14

granting the money to physical plant or to some other

15

purpose.

What is that --

16

MR. LAYTON:

Well, no, I -- I'm saying that

17

the physical plant is our case, because the physical

18

plant is a -- a -- an improvement to the church property

19

that the church will use and may use for actually

20

proselytizing and not just use it for religious

21

activities.

22

And wherever the line is, that ought to be

23

on the other side of the line, just like wherever the

24

line is, writing a check that says payable to Trinity

25

Lutheran Church ought to be on the other side of the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CORTMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just three points in rebuttal.
First of all, as to the endorsement problem,

12

I think the neutral government criteria here take care

13

of the endorsement problem.

14

competitive grant that you have to fill out this -- this

15

pretty complicated application, 16 neutral criteria,

16

there is no endorsement of religion.

17

speech cases give a good analogue to that.

18

So when you have this

I think the free

Number 2, as far as the selective or

19

universal government benefit program, I don't think that

20

is really the test here.

21

mention, if this was open to all schools, and it was

22

universal, they still would be prohibited from giving a

23

grant to a religious organization.

24

narrow class of all non-for-profits, or a broader class

25

of all schools, they would still not be able to fund

And the reason, as Your Honors

Alderson Reporting Company

So whether it's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

based on their constitution.

2

And lastly, as we talk about entanglement,

3

this is not an entanglement issue.

4

generally is an ongoing, intrusive surveillance.

5

not a one-time grant where you have to show a receipt

6

for the expense to receive the reimbursement.

If there are no other questions, I yield my
time.
