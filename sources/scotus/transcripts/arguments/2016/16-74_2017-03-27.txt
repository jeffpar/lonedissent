ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

Pension plans for religious non-profits have

13

been exempt from ERISA for over 30 years, whether or not

14

a church established the plan.

15

of the three courts below should be reversed for three

16

reasons.

17

And the contrary holding

First, the text does not require a church to

18

establish benefit plans for someone else's employees.

19

Second, the government's consistent view, over three

20

decades, has generated enormous reliance interest and

21

warrants deference.

22

resurrect the precise problems that everyone understood

23

the 1980 amendment would fix.

24
25

And third, affirmance would

I could start with the text.

And the main

text at issue here is subparagraph C(i) of section

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

1002(33).

2

has all the relevant provisions, so I think that's the

3

easiest, if you want to look at their appendix.

4

C(i) is -- is reprinted on -- on pages 11A.

5

And if you -- the government's brief actually

And

So again, we're looking at paragraph --

6

subparagraph C(i) of paragraph (33), which everyone in

7

this case agrees expands the original church plan

8

definition in subparagraph A.

9

Now, the only plausible reason that C(i)

10

repeats the entire phrase "a plan established and

11

maintained by a church" is Congress intended that C(i)

12

redefine and modify that entire phrase.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

There was a

14

provision that was proposed that would have done very

15

clearly what you think this provision does now.

16

Congress didn't pass it.

So an earlier version did

17

exactly what you wanted.

It said you can -- a plan that

18

establishes and/or maintained by a church.

19

MS. BLATT:

And

It -- it said established and --

20

and maintained.

21

that it -- the -- the assumption is incorrect that that

22

provision did everything that folks wanted.

23

didn't.

24

concedes was intended to be --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the problem, Justice Sotomayor, is

It actually

It -- it excluded the very plans that everyone

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BLATT:

2

Well, plans established by churches and

3

-- covered.

maintained by somebody else.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A plan established and

5

maintained by a church includes a plan established and

6

maintained by a church-affiliated organization.

7
8

MS. BLATT:

Right.

And that would have

excluded --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MS. BLATT:

Who?

It would have excluded plans

11

that -- where the church established and the -- the

12

pension board maintained.

13

And the other side --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

A plan

14

established and maintained by a church, so that's any

15

plan established by -- this is the old language, by the

16

way, so --

17

MS. BLATT:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

So here -But that's any church

19

plan.

20

maintained by a church-affiliated organization.

Plus it defined includes a plan established and

21

Why is not a pension plan?

22

MS. BLATT:

Because the problem is that

23

provision, the way it read, required the pension board

24

to not only maintain it, but it would have had to

25

establish it.

And so that excluded -- but -- but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A plan established and

maintained by a church-affiliated organization.
MS. BLATT:

Right.

So --

But it said "and."

And

4

so if -- if the church established it, then it wouldn't

5

have been a church plan established and maintained by a

6

church, and it wouldn't have been a plan established and

7

maintained by a pension board.

8
9

So -- and I think the clear thing in terms
of this uninterrupt -- I mean unpassed piece of

10

legislation is it came out in the last couple of days of

11

this several-year process, and it -- the change went

12

unmentioned, Justice Sotomayor, and it is -- it's just

13

implausible that that change went unnoticed when it

14

would have excluded all the plans that the religious

15

community was up in arms about, and all the plans that

16

prompted the amendment in the first place.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, still, Ms. Blatt,

18

there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of

19

accomplishing what you think this provision

20

accomplishes.

21

just saying any plan maintained by a church-affiliated

22

organization is a church plan or something like that.

23

You know, something along the lines of

It's -- it's very odd language, this

24

statutory language, and I'm wondering why you think that

25

Congress chose to do what you think it chose to do in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward

2

way?

3

MS. BLATT:

Sure.

I don't -- I don't find

4

it that -- that perplexing.

5

would have messed up -- when you tried to -- tried to

6

put it all in 33(A), it would have -- by saying just a

7

church plan, it would have redefined all of (A), which

8

had a second compound definition it -- of it had to be a

9

tax exempt under Section 501.

10

When your -- your version

But, Justice Kagan, let me cut to the chase

11

here.

12

could have done this better.

13

so complicated.

14

happened in 1974 and how -- just how different (C)

15

itself looks.

16

and there was an (A) and there was a subparagraph C.

17

And now we still have subparagraph C.

18

working with an existing apparatus.

19

If I had started from scratch, I don't know if I
I doubt it, because it's

But let's look at what actually

Because, remember, they started in 1974,

So they were

Now, old subparagraph C, itself, expressly

20

required the church to establish C plans.

21

plans had to include the church's own actual employees.

22

And Congress did two huge things in paragraph C now.

23

eliminated not only the express church establishment

24

requirement, but the very reason for that requirement in

25

the first place; namely, that these plans include the

Alderson Reporting Company

And these C

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

church's own employees.

2

So what we have now today, and I don't think

3

this is disputed, we know -- the one thing we do know is

4

that (C)(i) plans can be maintained wholly and

5

completely and absolutely outside the church and can

6

include solely, completely, and wholly outside the

7

church all the employees of any tax-exempt, religiously

8

affiliated employer.

9

So it just defies both common sense and our

10

background understanding under ERISA to require the

11

church to establish someone else's benefit plans when we

12

know employers are usually the ones who set the

13

employment benefits for their own employees.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not the problem with

15

your reading.

16

about principal-purpose organizations.

17

Respondent suggests that you would like it to read -- as

18

reproduced on page 27 of their brief, you would like it

19

to say includes a plan maintained by an organization

20

controlled by or associated with a church.

21

provision seems to be giving authority to

22

principal-purpose organizations and not to entities

23

controlled by or associated.

24
25

This (C)(i) seems to be predominantly

MS. BLATT:

Right.

And I think the

But this

Well, you're absolutely

right except for the point about how I would like it to

Alderson Reporting Company

read, because we like the way it reads now.

2

does is it -- and there's no question that our reading

3

gives independent meaning to principal-purposes

4

organization.

5

requirement is that the plan must be maintained by an

6

organization, whether external or internal, that has its

7

principal purpose the administration or funding of a

8

plan.

What this

We concede that an absolute full

9

But, Justice Ginsburg, the definition of a

10

principal-purpose organization includes a plan for any

11

employee of a church.

12

defined expressly in (C)(ii) to mean any employee not of

13

a church; namely, any church-affiliated, tax-exempt

14

organization.

15

either sitting in the hospital or religious charity or

16

it's a pension board that's externally incorporated,

17

Congress made sure that the maintaining organization,

18

the one with control over the funds and the

19

administration itself, has to be religiously affiliated.

20

An employee of a church is

So whether it's a pension board that's

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this is a tricky

21

question, but is this the question that was decided by

22

the courts of appeals and is it the question that we

23

agreed to review?

24
25

MS. BLATT:

No.

No.

So on remand, they

have an argument that, assuming we win, and that there's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

no formal requirement that the church establish the

2

plan, that the maintaining organization in this case,

3

these retirement committees, don't qualify.

4

But I do think it's -- it's quite important

5

to understand that, Justice Ginsburg, when Congress was

6

drafting this maintaining by a PPO, or principal-purpose

7

organization, it was merely defining exactly what before

8

and after 1980 and, regardless of the church plan

9

context, what every employment pension plan in America

10

looks like.

11

separate retirement committee or a separately

12

incorporated retirement committee.

13

They're being maintained by either a

Now, the other -- what I think, Justice

14

Alito, they were trying to say, it's anomalous that a

15

plan could be established by the hospital, but it has to

16

be run by a -- you know, an internal committee that's

17

either controlled or affiliated with a church.

18

anomalies are exponentially, you know, monstrous on the

19

other side.

20

entrusted a pension board to have control over all the

21

administration and the funding, but didn't allow it to

22

establish the plan, which is absurd given the historical

23

context that pension boards were both establishing and

24

maintaining.

25

But the

Justice Ginsburg, in their view, Congress

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Blatt, I -- putting

12

aside that purpose, do you think Congress had in mind

13

a -- corporations that are essentially like every other

14

corporation except they're not for profit?

15

these hospitals, some of them, like Dignity, the

16

Catholic church has disavowed any formal affiliation

with it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

you think that -- I understand the nuns, but you're

22

talking now about an extreme.

23

Go

MS. BLATT:

Well, the nuns established

24

Dignity, and a priest established St. Peter's, or a

25

bishop, rather.

So -- but let me just get back to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13

plan at issue.

2

In 1977 --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

The nuns may have, but

they're -- no longer are affiliated with the church.

5

MS. BLATT:

I'm happy to argue the facts of

6

Dignity and we can -- I mean, that is an argument the

7

other side on remand.

8
9

But the place where Congress dealt with your
concern about the institution that's not religious

10

enough was not with establishment, but (C)(iv) requires

11

any church plan that's -- that's being maintained by

12

these affiliated organizations to have common bonds

13

and -- common religious bonds and convictions.

14

Now, Dignity itself has that in spades.

It

15

has six orders, not one, not two, not three, not four,

16

not five, six orders of women religious running its

17

mission integrity committee --

Do you believe that Congress's vision was to

7

church is itself, I assume, some sort of corporate

8

entity.

But let me get to the bottom line here.

9

If you read Paul Clement's brief filed by

10

the Catholic church itself and the brief filed by the

11

United Church of Christ and the Evangelical Lutheran

12

Church of America and the Seventh-Day Adventists, that's

13

four churches, your decision applies to big and small,

14

15

think of Dignity -- and I have no doubt that it's --

16

it's both -- it has both Catholic bonds and Catholic

17

affiliations.

this.

legislative history.

So whatever you

We know Congress had in mind a hospital plan.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Blatt, I'd like

22

to get to your question about -- the point you raised

23

earlier on about the significance of the interpretation

24

of the IRS, the pension benefit board, and who -- what's

25

the other one?

The IRS --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- pension benefit.
What are the limits

6

of that proposition?

7

you're saying because these three government agencies

8

interpreted the statute one way, we shouldn't be more --

9

we should be inclined to interpret it that way?

10

I mean, I don't quite understand,

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

I think that reliance is

11

an important -- important reason why you should defer

12

under Skidmore.

And --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

maybe it's that I've never understood Skidmore.

15

anyway, as it's been articulated, it seems to be the

16

principle as you should defer to agencies when you agree

17

with their interpretation.

18

(Laughter.)

Well, Skidmore actually

says -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

that these agencies have interpreted it your way.

think we have to go back and interpret the statute

ourselves.

3

MS. BLATT:

Skidmore is still a decision, and it says what you said.

argument is under the IRS.

Mr. Chief Justice, the Respondents seek 11 billion; I am

not kidding, 11 billion per year.

In just two of these cases,

even any fraction of that amount, is reason enough for

2

you to make sure that the IRS's decision is somehow

3

unreasonable, that would jettison 30 years of settled

4

expectations.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress introduced the bills in response to the

not just even the retroactive penalties.

plans have been structured around the IRS, the

affirm, just for all the existing plans that were not

and unintended consequences, not just for the -- the --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

2

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

3
4

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

I'd like to first to pick up on a point that

6

Ms. Blatt alluded to when she was describing the -- the

7

history of the statute and its amendment.

8

statute in its current form is probably not the type of

9

provision that Congress would draft if it were doing the

I think the

10

whole thing in one fell swoop.

11

understand that the text of the -- the current provision

12

is the combination of things that were done in 1974 and

13

things that were done in 1980.

14

But it's important to

Congress enacted the original church plan

15

provision.

16

that were established and maintained by churches and it

17

covered those; and pretty quickly, problems came to

18

light.

19

covered by the administrative agency that Congress

20

evidently believed should be covered.

21

Congress amended the provision in 1980, it chose to work

22

within the existing framework.

23

why, but at least one plausible explanation would be

24

there were some church plans that had been found to be

25

covered under the old "established and maintained by a

Presumably, it had in mind particular plans

Other types of plans were found not to be

And so when

We're not quite sure

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

church" language.

2

possible inference that those plans were no longer

3

covered, and so it retained the original language, but

4

defined it to include something else.

5

Congress may have wanted to avoid any

And when Congress passed the -- the

6

provision that Ms. Blatt was discussing earlier, (C)(i),

7

that refers to a plan established and maintained for its

8

employees includes a plan maintained by a principal

9

purpose organization, I -- I think it's -- it's helpful

10

to recognize that there are two different sorts of

11

definitional provisions that Congress sometimes enacts.

12

Sometimes when Congress enacts a definition,

13

it's trying to clarify what the defined term really

14

means.

15

strain to read the definition in a way that makes it

16

consistent with ordinary understandings of a defined

17

term.

18

that says something like the -- for purposes of this

19

statute, the term "State" includes the District of

20

Columbia and Puerto Rico.

21

not trying to explain what State really means; it's

22

simply using a shorthand formulation to say, for

23

purposes of this statute, we want D.C. and Puerto Rico

24

to be treated the same way that the 50 States would be

25

treated.

And when Congress acts in that way, we tend to

But sometimes Congress will enact a provision

When Congress does that, it's

And that's really what Congress was doing in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1
2

the 1980 amendment.
When it defined the term "plan established

3

and maintained by a church" to include plans that

4

satisfied the prerequisites in the amendments, it -- it

5

was not saying this is what a plan established and

6

maintained by a church really is.

7

purposes of the exempt -- of the church plan exemption,

8

we want these to be treated the same.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It was saying, for

Mr. Stewart, can I ask you

10

about some of the Respondents' hypotheticals where they

11

offer hypothetical statutes that are very similar in

12

structure to this one?

13

would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans

14

and the one about the two presidential criteria, and

15

it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences

16

their way rather than your way; in other words, as just

17

going to one of the criteria.

18

think that's true, that they can come up with these

19

hypotheticals that so clearly should be interpreted

20

their way rather than your way.

21

And it's pretty clear that you

MR. STEWART:

And I'm wondering why you

I guess I would say about

22

the -- the hypothetical that is used most often -- most

23

often, person disabled and a veteran includes a member

24

of the National Guard.

25

absolutely literally, you would still say a National

I think if you read it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

Guard member who is not disabled is covered.

2

think the --

3
4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, I

I mean, that would seem

ridiculous, right?

5

MR. STEWART:

I think the instinct -- the --

6

the context would be such that courts would assume, I

7

believe, that Congress had simply made a -- a sort of

8

scrivener's error, that Congress had used language

9

sloppily.

10

Part -- part of that has to do with the

11

instinct that I -- I alluded to earlier.

12

would tend to regard a provision like that as one in

13

which Congress was really trying to explain what the

14

term "person who is disabled and a veteran" means, and

15

so we would strain to read the definition in a way that

16

made it consistent.

17

said something like:

18

veteran shall include any Federal employee with 30 years

19

or more of service, at -- at that point, we would

20

understand Congress has just abandoned the effort to

21

explain what person who is disabled and a veteran

22

actually means.

23

it wants employees with -- Federal employees with

24

unusually long service to get the same benefits as a

25

disabled veteran would get under a particular statute

That is, we

If Congress passed a statute that
Person who is disabled and a

It has decided for whatever reason that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

and has used shorthand to -- to accomplish that.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

See, I -- I would think that

3

the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're

4

setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and

5

you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say

6

there's a special case of veterans.

7

include National Guard folks, and that's not

8

disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard

9

folks.

We also mean to

But the two criteria are still the two criteria.

10

All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that

11

you are a National Guard.

12

language similarly.

13

maintained by a different kind of organization.

14

And you could read this

It's not disqualifying that it's

MR. STEWART:

I guess I -- all I would

15

concede based on these hypotheticals is that sometimes a

16

provision that is structured in this way will give rise

17

to the natural inference that Congress wanted to do

18

something other than simply deem a particular thing to

19

fall within the whole defined term and that it had in

20

mind a part.

21

But I think, in construing this provision,

22

it may be helpful to look at page 24 of the government's

23

brief which explains -- which kind of clarifies

24

something that Ms. Blatt was referring to earlier,

25

that -- that on page 24 of the -- the government's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

brief, we lay out the way in which this amendment

2

changed from the time it was first introduced in 1979 to

3

when it was enacted in 1980.

4

And as the questioning in the first part of

5

your argument explained, the original introduced

6

provision said a plan established and maintained by a

7

church shall include a plan established and maintained

8

by a principal-purpose organization.

9

words "established and" appeared two places in that

And so the -- the

10

introduced provision.

11

that the most likely explanation for what -- why

12

Congress took out the -- the second "established and"

13

was that it was worried about plans that would fall

14

between two stools, a plan that was established by a

15

church, but maintained by a principal-purpose

16

organization.

17

And as -- we agree with Ms. Blatt

That the --

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- the -- the

18

hypothetical would be like this case, or this case would

19

be like the hypothetical.

20

plan be established by the church was absolutely

21

critical, as the requirement that the -- the individual

22

have a disability is absolutely critical in the

23

hypothetical, which gets to the question:

24

significance, in practical terms, of a plan's being

25

established by a church?

If the requirement that the

Alderson Reporting Company

What is the

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

Now, Mr. Feldman says that an entity that

2

establishes a plan is financially responsible for paying

3

benefits under the plan if the plan is unable to do that

4

with its assets.

5

that right?

6

But you say that's not correct; is

MR. STEWART:

That's not correct.

I mean,

7

in -- in the typical ERISA case, you will have a plan

8

established and maintained by a single employer, and

9

that employer will be responsible for making good on the

10

promises, and -- and that employer may be a defendant in

11

a suit if the promises are breached.

12

mean that the entity that established as the plan qua

13

"establisher" is always going to be on the hook.

14

It -- it in --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. STEWART:

But that doesn't

Sometimes on the hook?

Sometimes on the hook, if the

17

establisher maintains ongoing responsibility.

18

there's -- first, there's no reason to think, even if

19

you applied ERISA standards, that a church that

20

established the plan, but then left the administration

21

of the plan entirely in the hands of somebody else,

22

could be held liable under ERISA.

23

But

Second, the whole point of the church plan

24

exemption is that plans that qualify will not be

25

regulated under ERISA at all.

They will be regulated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27

under State law.

2

this requirement, established the plan and then left its

3

maintenance to somebody else, whether the church would

4

have any ongoing liability would depend on State laws

5

that might vary around the country.

6

So if a church, in order to satisfy

JUSTICE ALITO:

So --

Can you -- can you tell me

7

what provision of ERISA -- and I'll ask Mr. Feldman the

8

same thing if I have the chance -- what provision of

9

ERISA explains which entity, if any, is responsible for

10

paying benefits if, for example, a defined benefit plan

11

is unable to do that with the assets in the plan?

12

MR. STEWART:

I -- I don't believe there is

13

a provision of ERISA that spells that out.

14

understanding -- and I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't have the

15

statutory cite -- is that there is a provision of ERISA

16

that authorizes the plan beneficiaries to sue, but it

17

doesn't specify who the defendant should be.

18

the courts have devised tests and approaches to

19

determine in particular cases who the proper defendant

20

is.

21

the plan itself is constructed; that is, the plan may

22

say that the responsibility for doing certain things is

23

that of the employer, for doing other things, it may be

24

that of the insurer.

25

My

And so

And to some extent, that will depend upon the way

And so the proper defendant may

2

And -- but so I agree that one big

3

difference between this case and the hypotheticals is

4

the -- the hypothetical is constructed in a way that

5

suggests disability has to be crucial to entitlement to

6

benefits, whereas here, there's no reason to think that

7

Congress, in 1980, regarded church establishment as

8

crucial to the exemption.

9
10

And -- and the point I was trying to
make about -- was going to make about --

11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:
question, right?

13

MR. STEWART:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

Well, but I guess that's the

But -- but -And the structure is the

same.
MR. STEWART:

I -- I guess the point I was

going to make about -- if I -- if I could finish this?

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. STEWART:

Sure.

-- about the way in which the

20

statute changed from introduction to final passage is

21

that everyone agrees that Congress could have more

22

clearly achieved the objective that Respondent says they

23

were trying to achieve if it had said a plan maintained

24

by a church includes a plan maintained by a

25

principal-purpose organization.

And so the idea seems

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

to be Congress was just a little bit careless in leaving

2

in "established and maintained" at the beginning.

3

That seems particularly implausible given

4

the care they took to knock out the second iteration of

5

"established and" in the same provision.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

This could be

I think if you look at what

16

Congress was -- this is what I would say.

17

their view, what you end up with is a statute that

18

doesn't fit what Congress enacted at all and creates

19

anomalies that are impossible to explain.

20

reasons at least, as well as the fact that Congress was

21

very jealous about creating exemptions to ERISA, ERISA

22

covers every private employer, every non-profit, every

23

hospital in the country, and there's only one -- except

24

there is only one category excluded, and that's church

25

plans.

If you accept

And for those

And Congress actually defined church plans

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

carefully.

2

and the plan because their purpose was they didn't want

3

to go involved in -- get involved in church affairs.

They wanted a close tie between the church

4

And so they said church plan has to be

5

established and -- established and maintained by a

6

church.

7

want -- if there's church involvement here, we want

8

hands off.

9

there's no reason why these hospitals, like any other

10

hospital in the country, and like many other -- every

11

other firm in the country shouldn't have to provide the

12

employees with the pension insurance to protect them

13

against the possibility that when the plan goes bust,

14

they end up with nothing --

15

It needs to fit both criteria because we

If there's no church involvement, though,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't there --

16

didn't Congress provide for church involvement by making

17

the employees covered by the principal-purpose entity

18

church employees?

19

MR. FELDMAN:

No, it's actually -- well,

20

just -- no, it didn't, actually.

21

statute actually doesn't say anything about the

22

principal-purpose entity.

23

The -- the -- that

So there's three different kinds of things

24

we are talking about here.

25

themselves, there's principal-purpose organizations,

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

I mean, the -- the

And the church --

6

it -- it -- what it said was, yes, it's -- it's -- was

7

facing a problem in 1980, which was the original statute

8

said if you're a church, you can cover not only your own

9

employees, but you can also cover the employees of your

10

church agencies.

11

but only until 1982.

12

objecting to, and that's why people was -- people were

13

objecting to the withdrawal of that sunset provision

14

that was going to happen in 1982.

15

That's what the original statute said,
And that is what everybody was

And the reason why they were talking about

16

agencies are very closely related to churches, that was

17

not a -- it was not to say -- their view is Congress

18

wanted to allow fishing.

19

split up -- these plans to split apart, and the agency

20

to have their own plan and the church to have their own

21

plan, and that's what they wanted.

22

opposite.

23

they had been, to provide -- to have a plan that would

24

cover both the churches' employees and the agencies'

25

employees.

They wanted these agencies to

But it's exactly the

They wanted to allow churches to continue, as

And they -- they were interested in

2

And actually, there's nobody anywhere who talked about

3

this statute who said, well, what we really need is to

4

allow another whole class of private entities to

5

establish their own plans.

6

They weren't interested in fishing.

So in the provision that Your Honor referred

7

to, where they -- they say, well, the employees of the

8

church-associated agency will be deemed to be employees

9

of the churches, Congress passed that provision to solve

10

exactly the 1982 problem.

11

has to be established and maintained by a church -- this

12

is in (A), which was left unchanged -- established and

13

maintained by a church for its employees.

14

the original statute they said:

care whose employees they are, but you also can cover

16

the church agency --

Okay?

were so evident, why do the three government agencies

responsible in this area -- the IRS, the Department of

20

Labor, the PBGC -- why for 30 years did they take the

21

opposite view?

22

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, it's -- they took this

23

view in the early 1980s at a time when they were facing

24

one or two -- I -- I'm not sure they knew at the time

25

when they started down this road what it was going to

faith with the -- with the assurance of the IRS that

what they were doing was lawful.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

And that entitled them

to exactly what it was supposed to -- the government had

that "this may not be relied upon" language because it

didn't want to be bound to this.

the literal meaning of that, as all three courts of

6

appeals unanimously agreed, the literal meaning of that

7

was -- this is not a -- a standalone statute that

8

says -- there are statutes in the U.S. code that say --

9

that don't define a term, and then they say, but a

10

felony includes something or other.

11

define "felony," they just say a felony includes

12

something or other.

13

then courts are supposed to figure out what else a

14

felony includes.

15

Okay?

They don't

That's one kind of statute.

But this statute doesn't do that.

And

And in

16

fact, the language at the beginning of (C)(i), a plan

17

established and maintained by a church, ties it to --

18

this -- you actually can't read (C)(i) as a standalone

19

statute, because it wouldn't make any sense.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. FELDMAN:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm talking about -It ties it to a --- the literal language of

23

(C)(i), and you're now talking about everything else.

24

The literal language of (C)(i) says:

25

and maintained by a church includes a plan that is

MR. FELDMAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.
And it's as simple as that,

that read literally, it is not required that it be

established --

MR. FELDMAN:

And --- by a church.

Now, you

have other arguments, but --

9

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I -- Your Honor, I

10

respectfully disagree.

11

said one thing more often than anything else in the

12

context of statutory interpretation, it's that you have

13

to read things in context and you have to read statutes

14

as a whole.

15

directly back to A, which Congress said in 1980, we are

16

retaining A the way it is.

17

18

The Court -- if the Court has

And this (C)(i) has language that ties it

And I think you have to read

If you read them both together, what you

19

say -- the basic form is whether it's the example of the

20

disabled veterans, the present or the examples that they

21

give in the reply brief, the basic form of this is if

22

you have a statute that says here's a rule that applies

23

to A and B, and then it says A and B includes a

24

particular kind of B -- which is what this says,

25

right? -- established and maintained includes a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

particular kind of maintenance, then that is naturally

2

taken to mean, well, we're -- we're --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

MR. FELDMAN:

5

Well, why would you --- we're qualifying the B, but

we're not doing anything to the A.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why would you repeat the

7

requirement of the A?

8

have just said a plan maintained by a church includes a

9

plan maintained by one of these organizations.

In other words, Congress could

And -Right.

And that -- so

another way of asking the question is, under your

13

interpretation, established and have no -- have no

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I actually don't think

16

that that's quite right.

They could have worded this

other ways.

19

position -- Petitioners' position -- positioning.

20

They certainly could have worded the

But this -- the point of repeating that

21

language was directly to tie it -- it was one way to

22

directly tie it back into A and say:

talking about these things.

24

25

notice -- it's not B -- it doesn't say -- I mean, and

Okay, now we're

We want to include a

Now, that is one thing to

wanted to have -- require them to have a

principal-purpose organization at all.

You have to go to a principal -- an agency

you have to have them maintain it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FELDMAN:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

From your --

And there's no --- your perspective,

16

what is the practical significance of requiring that

17

the -- excuse me -- plans be established by a church?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

I think the practical

19

significance is Congress's purpose here -- and, again, I

20

don't think this is in dispute, and there's no other

21

purpose that's been suggested, was hands off the church.

22

If a church is involved with a plan, we don't -- we

23

don't -- we want to have -- leave them the freedom to be

24

outside of ERISA.

25

there's no church involved, as there is in this case,

But there's no church involved.

the church has --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FELDMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

But --

-- no direct involvement --- well, but you --

5

I guess you began with that, and the church is involved

6

to the extent the law says that the principal purpose

7

is -- agency is maintaining that fund for people who are

8

defined to be church employees.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

10

Right.

But the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you can't say the

11

church is not involved in that -- in the situation

12

before us.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

Actually -- I think you

14

can.

15

employees who are so defined are actually employees of

the church agency.

1

MR. FELDMAN:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They do.

And -So I thought the

3

whole concern with the original IRS problem was that the

4

IRS was treating church agencies as if they were not

5

engaged in a church function.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

I -They were saying --

8

they were saying, okay, the -- the church has an agency

9

whose mission is to, you know, feed the hungry, clothe

10

the naked, all of that, and the IRS was saying, well,

11

that's not a church; it's got nothing to do with it.

12

And now it's changed and those -- those individuals that

13

are engaged in that social mission are treated as

14

members of the church agency.

15
16

MR. FELDMAN:

They are treated that way so

that the --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. FELDMAN:

The church agency.

They are doing that so that

19

the church can include them in its plan if they wanted.

20

And that -- if the church wants to do that, that's fine

21

and they can do that.

22

point of that provision was to eliminate the 1982 cutoff

that wouldn't have allowed the churches -- the churches

to continue to do that.

Tell me how your reading of the statute includes the

organizations that were clamoring and for whom the IRS

had said were covered by this provision:

boards that were separate from the church, and Ms. Blatt

7

pointed to the sisters, the nuns, who were also seeking

8

coverage.

situations facing Congress?

The pension

How does your reading take care of those two

10

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it actually perfectly

11

matches with those two situations.

12

(C)(iii) provisions, as I said, they allow churches to

13

continue if they wanted to cover church agencies and

14

eliminate the 1982 cutoff that people were concerned

15

about.

16

provision about let's drastically expand the types of

17

entities that are -- and by millions of employees, the

18

types of employees who don't have ERISA protection.

This was what Representative Conable termed a

20

technical --

21

The (C)(ii) and

The (C)(i) provision said that was not a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I would have thought

22

that the -- the one thing that seems most clear from a

23

pretty murky legislative history is the church pension

24

boards were supposed to be included in this.

25

church pension boards, some of them were established --

And the

their plans were established by the church, some of them

not.

pension boards that I thought are the sort of

quintessential group that this was designed to include.

So you would be taking out some of these church

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I really -- I disagree

6

with the premise of that.

7

no -- there is nothing in the legislative history that

said, you know, anybody -- there's -- let me say this

correctly.

If you look back, you know,

13

they're actually -- Congress had no -- that was not the

14

way they operated then.

15

operate now.

16

But we actually go over each of the ones in our

It's actually not the way they

The way they operate is, these are for

17

congregational churches primarily, and in a

18

congregational type of set up, you have an assembly or

19

synod of the church itself, and this is just an assembly

20

of all the local churches and they -- they will

21

establish the plans.

But if they don't have the --

What does it mean to

2

any statutory definition of what it takes to establish a

3

plan.

4

MR. FELDMAN:

So and -- I didn't see

And as -- as this Court -- the

5

Halifax case, I think, establishes it.

6

a commitment to provide some kind of a reasonably

7

definite benefits over -- to -- in under -- to some

8

employees, you know, reasonably well defined.

what it means.

10

It means making

That's

If you don't make that commitment, if you

11

say the church said we want somebody else to have a plan

12

and lay out what the terms would be, actually the church

13

would definitely not have established the plan.

14

would be somebody else who if they took them up on it

15

would.

It

But for the church to establish a plan, and

17

this case is actually -- the Dignity case is a perfect

18

example.

19

not a difficult inquiry.

20

and if you look around page 56A of the cert petition

appendix, in the Dignity case, the district court said

22

well, who established this plan, well, Dignity, the

adopted a summary plan description, and they established

of commitment.

And

You need some kind

Now, Congress -- Congress, when that kind of

commitment was made by a church, Congress said we want

very much like in the tax code, there's numerous other

places where you have to distinguish between churches

and church agencies.

11

In Section 26 U.S.C. 7611, gives churches

quite extraordinary protection against audits, against

13

the circumstances under which they can be audited, the

types of things that can be looked at and the rights

It applies only to churches

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in the situation where

the church establishes the plan and then turns over the

maintenance of the plan to a principal-purpose

organization, the audits would be the books of the

principal-purpose organization.

much to look for in the records of the church.

There wouldn't be very

2

So if that's the -- if that was the purpose
of it, I don't see what the establishment requirement --

3

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I would think that it's

4

more than just looking at the books and records at that

5

particular time.

6

is establishing a plan, it's making some kind of

7

commitment of what kind of benefits who's going to get

plan, and how it's going to be funded.

There being -- when the church is --

That's what it means to establish a -- a

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it might --

But you say -- where --

11

where do I look to find that?

12

find the provision that says what you say, which is that

13

the entity that establishes the plan is financially

14

responsible?

15

MR. FELDMAN:

And where do I look to

The -- the financially -- it's

16

financially responsible to the extent that what it says

17

when it established the plan.

18

especially if it's not --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, I suppose,

It's -- it's responsible --

20

it's responsible to the extent the plan makes it

21

responsible?

22

Is that the answer?
MR. FELDMAN:

It -- it's -- it's -- under

23

ERISA, plans can't limit their liability.

24

I -- the -- the person -- parties establishing plans

25

can't.

Alderson Reporting Company

But, I mean,

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

But under -- if it's not an ERISA plan, they

2

probably can have provisions that say we're only going

3

to give you what's -- the money that's in the plan --

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But where is the

provision that --

6

MR. FELDMAN:

But they still have to make a

7

commitment and that would be governed by, presumably, in

8

the case of non-ERISA plan, by state law.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But --

But where is the provision

10

of ERISA that supports what you said, which is -- it

11

seems to me to be a significant point, that the entity

12

that establishes the plan is financially responsible for

13

the plan.

What is the provision of ERISA --

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

MR. FELDMAN:

It makes --- that says that?
It -- I think it's -- I can't

Mr. Stewart suggested the opposite.

MR. FELDMAN:

We believe that it can't.

4

And, in fact, there would be no reason at all for

5

Congress to have -- we -- a part -- according to my

6

friend, Congress wanted to be sure that whoever is

7

maintaining the plan is somebody who is associated with

8

the church.

9

But there was no reason to talk about

10

principal-purpose, employee benefit organizations that

11

are primarily involved in employee benefits if that's

12

what you wanted to accomplish.

13

the -- this makes sense if you look at it as something

14

that congregational denominations were doing as of 1980,

15

which is they found it convenient to have the

16

maintenance of the plan done by an organization that was

17

an employee benefits organization and nobody objected to

18

that.

19

object to it; nobody did.

20

if that's a convenient way to -- they were talking about

21

how to run a plan, not opening up the plan to a broad

range -- not opening up the exemption to a broad range

of plans and probably millions of employees.

And just back to --

Mr. Halperin didn't

That's fine if you want to --

Why -- how many -- how

many -- how many employees did come in under the IRS

interpretation for 30 years that wouldn't have come in

had the IRS followed yours, if you know?

rough hand.

About, just

I would assume all of them.
I mean, I would like to get

7

a rough idea of what you are talk -- we're talking

8

about, because your argument practically depends on if

9

we keep following the IRS interpretation there will be

10

vast numbers of plans that come in that wouldn't

11

otherwise.

12

They followed it for 30 years.
I'd like to get a rough, empirical idea of

13

how many have come in because they didn't accept your

14

interpretation, how many employees are -- are exempt

15

that wouldn't have otherwise been.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

They say that there

17

are a million employees that have been in these plans.

employees in the future, once this Court reaches a

20

decision that --

21

Why?

Why won't they be

kept out by the principal purpose definition unless they

really are the Little Sisters of the Poor?

MR. FELDMAN:

They wouldn't be kept out any

more than -- than Petitioners in this case, would they?

two interpretations.

another -- I have another thing I want to know.
The Catholic church establishes the plan,

it's established by the Little Sisters of the Poor, it's

out?

MR. FELDMAN:

That's -- that's right, and

the reason is because Congress --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. FELDMAN:

Okay.

-- what Congress was most

7

concerned about here was not going into the church's

8

books and records.

9

these -- their books and records are open to the public,

10

These agencies like the Petitioners,

they're open to --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is true.

But, I mean,

12

if it's a legitimate organization like, let's say the

15

they do have a lot of involvement --

else said, well, we were -- you know, the churches

-- what -And the other thing they

wanted to do was what Representative Conable called a

10

technical problem, which is they wanted to enable

church -- these congregational churches to maintain

12

plans in a different way than they had been -- to

13

maintain plans through this separate agency because that

14

was the way they found it most convenient to do.

15

And that actually explains this language of

16

why they're talking in the first place about principal

17

purpose agencies and why that doesn't apply to -- the

18

churches can establish and maintain a plan, and that's

19

fine.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Feldman, why do you

21

think -- I mean, I've -- I have read all your arguments

22

about why the IRS letters are not entitled to deference.

23

But I come at it from a different point, which is it was

24

in part these private organizations, religious

25

organizations, but the IRS, too, who was lobbying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

Congress to express itself on this issue and take care

2

of what the IRS knew was a problem for all these people.

3

And then all of a sudden, almost immediately after the

4

legislation is passed, the IRS is believing and stating

5

that it's done more than you claim.

6

Isn't that, in itself, evidence -- not the

7

Skidmore deference -- but evidence that the agency

8

believed that the answer was different than you're

9

promoting right now?

10

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I -- you know, the agency

did believe the answer was different, that that is in

2

be a hard thing to do, and a district court should be

3

able to do it, giving them whatever period of time is

4

reasonable.

That's the overwhelming thing that's at

5

issue here.

And in fact, if, as they say, they haven't

6

departed from ERISA that much, which we don't agree or

7

believe, then it should be particularly easy to bring

8

them into compliance with ERISA.

9

That shouldn't

The only two things that are

10

backward-looking at all are the civil damages, which I

11

mentioned, and the fact that you may have to adjust some

12

vesting schedules between three and five years, which is

13

likely to be a minor problem.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MS. BLATT:

So I'm just going to start with

the funding issue.
The one thing that's pellucid about C is

21

that the church does not have to fund C(i) plans because

22

the statute explicitly allows the maintaining

23

organization to fund it.

24

outside the church, which means the church are

25

absolutely off the hook.

And C(i) moves maintenance

5

guess that's because they're not priests.

6

The sponsoring congregations did

And I

The other thing I would ask you to read is

7

the brief by the United Church of Christ and the

8

Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.

9

that the centralization that an establishment

10

requirement would impose is anathema to their religious

11

beliefs.

12

is.

13

Establishment turns on day one.

14

throughout time immemorial, there being -- the other

15

side concedes you can maintain them.

16

that there is some umbrella church for -- for the Jews

17

and the Protestants is just -- it's fantastical that

18

could possibly establish these plans.

And it's the same reason that the maintenance

It's the continuum, establishment and maintenance.

19

And then day two,

But the notion

The other thing I wanted to mention, the

20

other side keeps talking about these closely-tied joint

21

plans.

22

pellucid about C is that an exempt plan can cover every

23

single employee in this country for a religious

24

non-profit institution and not a single church employee

25

needs to be in that plan.

But the only other thing we know that is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

The other side is asking you to engage in a

2

counterintuitive kind of weird thing that a church would

3

set the dental plans and vesting requirements for

4

employees of an affiliated organization, especially in a

5

place like the Jewish and Protestant religions.

6

that -- that just is not credible.

And

7

And finally, on the anomalies.

8

have the anomalies that the pension board would want to

9

divorce the establishment from the maintenance.

I mean, they

They

10

have the anomaly that -- that the nuns are left out in

I don't want to --

sentence.

MS. BLATT:

Oh.

That the YMCA is the only,

16

this exemption, and they have this sort of silliness

employees.
