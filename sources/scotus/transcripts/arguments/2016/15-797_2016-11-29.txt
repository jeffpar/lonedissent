CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case No. 15-797, Moore v. Texas.

5

Mr. Sloan.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SLOAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that

11

the Eighth Amendment prohibits executing people who are

12

intellectually disabled.

13

Court reiterated that the inquiry into whether somebody

14

is intellectually disabled for that important Eighth

15

Amendment purpose should be informed by the medical

16

community's diagnostic framework and by clinical

17

standards.

18

And in Hall v. Florida, this

Texas has adopted a unique approach to

19

intellectual disability in capital cases in which it

20

prohibits the use of current medical standards.

21

relies on harmful and inappropriate lay stereotypes,

22

including the so-called Briseno factors.

23

extraordinary, virtually insuperable, and clinically

24

unwarranted causation requirement.

25

fundamentally, it challenges and disagrees with this

Alderson Reporting Company

It

It uses an

And most

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

Court's core holding in Atkins; namely, that the entire

2

category of the intellectually disabled, every person

3

who is intellectually disabled, is exempt from execution

4

under the Eighth Amendment.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

I -- I -- excuse me, Chief

Justice.

8
9

Those are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a long

laundry list of objections you have.

Your question

10

presented, though, focused only on one, which is that it

11

prohibits the use of current medical standards and

12

requires outdated medical standards.

13

several of the other points you made are not encompassed

14

within that question presented.

15

questions that should be looked at, but they don't seem

16

to be covered by that.

17

And I think

And maybe there are

I mean, in what -- you mentioned the

18

correspondence with clinical practices.

19

changed?

20

practices under the old standard as it is under the new?

21

Has that

Did Texas similarly depart from clinical

MR. SLOAN:

It -- it did.

The prohibition

22

on the use of current medical standards aggravates and

23

exacerbates that.

24

But if I could address Your Honor's question

25

about the -- the question presented, because I'd like to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

make two points with regard to that, Your Honor, which

2

is that, first of all, it is woven into the Texas Court

3

of Criminal Appeals' decision and the judgment that is

4

before the Court, because the Texas court grounded its

5

determination on the prohibition of consulting and using

6

current medical standards on its Briseno opinion and

7

Briseno framework.

8

in Briseno in 2004, that framework governs, including

9

the clinical standards at the time, but also its view

And the Court said, what we decided

10

that medical standards generally are exceedingly

11

subjective.

12

That was very important to the Court in its

13

determination here.

14

--

It's at 6a of the Petition Appendix

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Mr. Sloan, can I -I have the same question

17

as -- as the Chief Justice.

18

the question presented doesn't cut to the heart of the

19

case as you describe it.

20

It -- it just seems to me

My understanding of your argument -- and

21

again, I don't think it's wholly reflected in that

22

question -- is that whether you use the most current or

23

even slightly -- slightly older medical standards, there

24

is still a conflict.

25

Am I right about that, that that's your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

theory?

2

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And if I could

3

add one point, though, it is that the current clinical

4

standards accentuate the conflict, make it even more

5

clear.

And what has happened with the --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We wouldn't need that, would

7

we, Mr. Sloan?

We could say that the Briseno standards

8

are in conflict with the old Atkins standards, as well

9

as the new ones.

There wouldn't need to be a difference

10

between the old ones and the new ones for you to win

11

this case.

12

MR. SLOAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you got in the

14

door by a question presented that is a little more

15

eye-catching, which is that they prohibit the current

16

standards and rely on the outdated one.

17

it says.

18

the door with a -- with a dramatic question presented

19

and are now going back to a concern that was just as

20

present, as I understand your argument, under the old

21

standards. .

22

And that's all

And I'm just wondering if you got yourself in

MR. SLOAN:

Two points on that, Your Honor.

23

First, again as I was saying, it is woven into the court

24

of criminal appeals' decision.

25

judgment on the prohibition of the use of current

One cannot look at their

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

medical standards without looking at the framework in

2

which they grounded it.

3

But, secondly, Your Honor --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I just make -- I'm

5

sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sloan, but could I just make

6

sure I understand that?

7

saying is that the court of appeals said, you are barred

8

from using new standards; you must use the Briseno

9

standards.

Because what you're essentially

So the two are flip sides of the same coin,

10

and what the holding was, is you must use Briseno

11

standards.

12

Now, your QP reflected their framing of the

13

issue -- you can't use new standards; you must use the

14

Briseno standards -- but you were just reflecting their

15

essential holding, which is, we have this Briseno case

16

and you have to use it.

17
18

MR. SLOAN:

That's -- that's exactly right,

Your Honor.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then why

20

didn't you say that?

I mean, really, the question

21

presented talks about a comparison between current and

22

outdated, and it seems -- it's pretty dramatic to say

23

you can't use current standards; you're only using

24

outdated.

25

know, they used the Briseno standards and they

It's quite a different question, is -- you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

shouldn't.

2

You don't think they should have used the

3

Briseno standards under the old medical standards, do

4

you?

5

MR. SLOAN:

No, that's correct.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. SLOAN:

Okay.

But I think, Your Honor, first

8

of all, the question presented, we absolutely stand by

9

it, because they have prohibited the use of current

10

medical standards and, instead, they have required the

11

use of the 1992 standard --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me ask you -- let

13

me ask you the same question in -- in different terms,

14

and you can tell me that -- whether this is not a fair

15

paraphrase of your question.

16

me a yes-or-no answer to this question, I'd appreciate

17

it.

18

And I -- if you can give

Under Hall and Atkins, must a State use

19

current medical standards, for example, DSM-5, as

20

opposed to older standards, for example, DSM-IV?

21

no.

22
23

MR. SLOAN:

Yes or

No, with that wording, Your

Honor.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. SLOAN:

Then I don't know --

It's because --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- how you can recover on

2

the question -- you can prevail on the question that you

3

presented to us.

4

MR. SLOAN:

Because, Your Honor, the

5

question presented talks about prohibiting.

6

Honor had said can a State prohibit --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Your

Well, I don't understand

8

what you mean by "prohibit."

You mean prohibit the --

9

the lower courts from using a standard different from

10

the one that the court of criminal appeals has said is

11

the standard that has to be used everywhere in Texas?

12

So each -- each trial level judge would apply a

13

different standard, whatever that judge thinks is the

14

right one?

15

MR. SLOAN:

And that the Court said

16

prospectively the law of Texas is you -- is that you're

17

prohibited from using the current medical standards.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you think that this is a

19

question of trial court discretion?

20

the discretion to use the newer standards as opposed to

21

the -- as opposed to the standards that the court of

22

criminal appeals says are the appropriate ones?

23

MR. SLOAN:

A trial court has

No, I don't think it's

24

discretion.

I think the Court has prohibited.

25

Court said that the State habeas trial court erred by

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

employing the current standards.

2

the Court used.

3
4

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the language

As opposed to the ones that

the court of criminal appeals had itself adopted.

5

MR. SLOAN:

From -- from 1992, and so it --

6

it's helpful to consider if the court of criminal

7

appeals' decision stands, how --

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Sloan, cut to the

chase of the underlying question.

Was the criminal

10

court of appeals using any clinical standard, any

11

medical clinical standard?

12

MR. SLOAN:

No, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. SLOAN:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

It was making up --

They -- they -Mr. Sloan, I don't think you

16

finished answering my question.

17

rephrase it this way:

18

Briseno or Briseno opinion.

There are two -- let me

There are different things in the

19

One is the -- the medical standards that are

20

taken from the medical publications that were current as

21

of the time of that decision.

22

additional considerations, and that's what's regarded as

23

the Briseno factors.

24
25

And then there are these

But if you -- let's take a -- disregard the
latter.

The first part are current -- are medical

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

standards that were current at that time, are they not?

2

MR. SLOAN:

Well, I respectfully disagree,

3

Your Honor, in this respect, because what the Court said

4

in Briseno was, after talking about following the 1992

5

standard, it said we view the medical standards as

6

exceedingly subjective.

7

Court used in Briseno, and that's why we are going to

8

come up with these Briseno factors on our own that are

9

nonclinical.

10

That's the wording that the

In fact, they are anti-clinical because

11

they're -- they're based on these lay stereotypes.

12

that's exactly what the Court said here as its

13

justification for its prohibition on the use of current

14

medical standards.

15

And

Its justification, as it says, is 6a to 7a

16

of the petition appendix is the Court's long-standing

17

view about the subjectivity surrounding the medical

18

diagnosis of the intellectual disability which stands in

19

sharp contrast to what this Court has said in Atkins and

20

in Hall, where, in Atkins, the clinical definitions were

21

fundamentally -- as this Court said in Hall, the

22

clinical definitions were a fundamental premise of Hall.

23

And as Hall said, the inquiry has to be informed by the

24

medical community's diagnostic framework, and there is

25

no way that it can be informed by the medical

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

community's diagnostic framework if the -- if there is

2

an exclusion and a prohibition on using current medical

3

standards.

4

And, Justice Alito --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is no doubt about

6

what the Texas court said.

It's marching orders for

7

Texas courts.

8

employing current clinical definition of intellectually

9

disabled, there in that respect, rather than the test we

It said the habeas judge erred by

10

established in Briseno.

The test we established in

11

Briseno is -- is stated sharply and clearly as the test

12

that must be applied by Texas courts.

13

Is that how you read it?

14

MR. SLOAN:

15

Yes, exactly, Your Honor.

And --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. SLOAN:

It's on page 6a in these?

That's right.

And I think it is

18

helpful here to consider how Atkins adjudications -- and

19

obviously, this is a vitally important, life-or-death

20

issue that goes to human -- the human dignity of the

21

intellectually disabled and how these adjudications will

22

proceed in Texas after the opinion in light of the

23

passage that Justice Ginsburg just quoted the critical

24

passage, is that, to judges, to lawyers, and to clinical

25

experts testifying in Texas, the message is clear and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

unmistakable:

2

clinical guidance.

3

You may not consult or rely on current

And so think about that from a clinician's

4

perspective.

5

with evaluating and making this vitally important

6

evaluation of somebody, about whether they are

7

intellectually disabled, that person has gotten the

8

clear and unmistakable instruction, and will by the

9

lawyers, you have to go back to the 1992 standard; you

10

A clinical expert who has been entrusted

can't consider the standards since then.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Sloan, I think it's more

12

than that.

13

current guidance and you have to go back to the '92

14

standard.

15

Briseno has these seven factors that are not consistent

16

with the old standards, just as they are not consistent

17

with the new standards.

18

Because it's not just you can't consult the

It says, you have to go back to Briseno, and

MR. SLOAN:

That -- that's exactly right,

19

Your Honor, and it's also part of a broader problem in

20

the framework interwoven with Briseno itself.

21

Briseno is setting up a framework where it's saying that

22

only those who are the most severely intellectually

23

disabled are exempt from the death penalty, and that

24

it's an open question, it says in Briseno, whether those

25

who are more mildly intellectually disabled, or mentally

Alderson Reporting Company

Where

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

retarded as they said at the time, are similarly exempt.

2

And this Court in Atkins had just held that there is a

3

bright line exemption for the intellectually disabled.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I tried to ask myself if

5

the Court could say, use the Briseno factors first, and

6

after that, if you find no intellectual disability, then

7

turn to the clinical standards.

8

points out, I think there is a conflict.

9

MR. SLOAN:

But as Justice Kagan

There absolutely is, and it's

10

all rooted by the conflict of clinical standards

11

generally and the prohibition on the use of current

12

medical standards and the hostility to current medical

13

standards --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it is true that Atkins

15

left some discretion to the States.

16

that you propose for how closely standards must hew to

17

medical practice?

18

MR. SLOAN:

What is the rule

I think it's the rule that the

19

Court notes and -- and explained in Hall, which is that

20

the State must be informed by the medical community's

21

diagnostic framework, and so what I understand that to

22

mean is that -- and -- and, of course, as the Court said

23

in Atkins and in Hall and Brumfield, the clinical

24

definitions are very, very important that you have to

25

inform it.

And if a State wants to conflict with or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

disagree with the clinical standard, then there has to

2

be a sound reason for doing so.

3

this Court identified several considerations.

4

four considerations in particular that would go into

5

evaluating whether there is a sound reason for doing so.

6

And I think in Hall,
There are

And the first is, is there genuinely a

7

clinical consensus on that point?

The second is, what

8

do other States do on that point?

The third is, what

9

does the State do in other intellectual disability

10

context?

11

Briseno factors and this prohibition on current medical

12

standards only in the death penalty context, in no other

13

intellectual disability context.

14

And very tellingly here, Texas uses these

And as the Court explained in Hall, the

15

condition, as the Court said in Hall, of intellectual

16

disability has applicability far beyond the death

17

penalty.

18

here, treats it very differently with much more severe

19

restrictions on finding intellectual disability only in

20

the death penalty, it is at the very least a very major

21

red flag.

And so when a State does, as Texas is doing

But --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Mr. Sloan, can we go -Justice Sotomayor?

Can we go to the

practical application of what you're saying for a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16

moment?

2

Let's take the decision of the CCA here.

3

All right?

4

met:

5

intellectually disabled, that his IQ was higher than

6

what was generally recognized clinically.

7

do wrong with respect to that prong?

That he couldn't prove that he was clinically

8
9
10

They found two prongs that Mr. Moore had not

What did they

And then secondly, with respect to the
adaptive-function prong, what did the court below do
wrong?

11

Identify the two ways in which what they're

12

doing and how they're applying the standards we're

13

talking about were in error.

14

MR. SLOAN:

I will, Your Honor.

And as to

15

both, they are in very sharp conflict with the clinical

16

guidance generally and especially with current clinical

17

standards.

18

So beginning with the intellectual deficits

19

in the IQ, the Court of Criminal Appeals accepted as

20

valid an IQ test of 74, which, as the Court explained in

21

Hall, with the standard error of measurement would take

22

it down to 69, well within the range for intellectual

23

disability.

24

But what the court did here is that it

25

chopped off the lower end of the standard error of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

measurement.

2

decisive and as in and of itself determining that

3

Mr. Moore could not establish an intellectual deficit

4

and he could not establish intellectual disability,

5

which conflicts with clinical standards, current

6

clinical standards, and this Court's decision in Hall.

7

It then treated the 74, the number 74, as

The reasons that the court gives for lopping

8

off the end of the -- the lower end of the standard

9

error of measurement are completely clinically

10

unsupportable.

11

poor academic performance.

12

consistent with an intellectual deficit or with

13

intellectual disability.

14

may have been depressed because he was on death row.

15

Well, there's no death row -- there is no rule that if

16

somebody is on death row, you cut off the lower end of

17

the standard.

18
19

The court says that he had a history of
Well, of course, that's not

The court also says, well, he

There is no medical rule

to that.

20

MR. SLOAN:

That's --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. SLOAN:

No medical support.

There's no medical support.

23

There's no clinical basis for that.

24

points to what it views as a depressive episode from

25

2005, which was 16 years after he took the exam in 1989.

Alderson Reporting Company

And the court

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I thought the most

2

significant part of this alleged error by you in your

3

briefs were that it assumed that things like poverty,

4

poor nutrition, poor performance in school were not

5

attributable to intellectual functioning, but to his

6

lack of a good home, essentially.

7

clinically wrong?

8
9

MR. SLOAN:

Why is that

Because, Your Honor -- so in

terms of the causation requirement, which is, I think,

10

what Your Honor is referring to -- and there are --

11

there are three major problems with the way the court

12

dealt with causation from --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think the court's --

14

would you say something about the adaptive behavior?

15

Because I think that may be a stronger leg.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why don't you deal

17

with Justice Sotomayor's question first and then Justice

18

Alito's.

19

MR. SLOAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

So in terms of the causation, first the

21

court says at page 10a of the petition appendix, they

22

emphasize that intellectual deficits caused it rather

23

than some other cause like the causes Your Honor is

24

talking about.

25

matter that there is a very high incidence in

And it's well understood as a clinical

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

intellectual disability of multiple causation,

2

co-morbidity.

3

than some other cause is completely at odds with the

4

clinical understanding to begin with.

5

So that view of the inquiry is -- rather

Secondly, factors that the court points to

6

include things, in addition to what Your Honor was

7

saying like, again, poor academic performance, his

8

terrible childhood abuse that he suffered, which not

9

only do not detract from a finding of intellectual

10

disability, they are well recognized as -- as risk

11

factors and associated characteristics of intellectual

12

disability.

13

And third, and very importantly, as the --

14

as the AAIDD explains in its amicus brief, from a

15

clinical perspective, there is absolutely no way to make

16

the kind of showing that the court requires here about

17

rather than some other cause.

As a clinical matter,

18

it's simply impossible to do.

And this Court in Hall

19

talked about the risk and the threat that Atkins would

20

be turned into a nullity.

21

that kind of causation requirement that it turns it into

22

a nullity.

23
24
25

And there is no question with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now -- now maybe you

can respond to Justice Alito.

In terms of the adaptive deficits, Your

2

Honor -- and it's important at the outset to recognize

3

certain points that are undisputed in the record.

4

it's undisputed, for example, that the at the age of 13,

5

Mr. Moore did not understand the days of the week, the

6

months of the year, the seasons, how to tell time, the

7

principle that subtraction is the opposite of addition,

8

standard units of measurement.

9

other deficits like that that are undisputed.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there are numerous

But what was the -- what is

the problem with their analysis of that point?

12
13

And

MR. SLOAN:

So there are four problems, Your

Honor.

14

So one of them is that the court focuses on

15

what it perceives as some strengths, which it says

16

outweighs the deficits and --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

On that one, is there

18

a consensus in the medical community that that's

19

improper?

20

MR. SLOAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

And, in fact --

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, here is an article

23

written by a number of experts, recent article from the

24

Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,

Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases

after Hall and DSM-5.

One of these experts was cited in

2

the -- in -- in one of the supporting amicus briefs by

3

professional organizations in Hall, which says that any

4

assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient

5

consideration to assets and deficits alike.

6

So what -- what do you make of that?

7

these are just -- these are -- are these quacks?

8

MR. SLOAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

That

Um -This is Dr. Hagan, Drogin,

and Guilmette.

11

MR. SLOAN:

Well, Your Honor, the clinical

12

guidance from both the AAIDD and the American

13

Psychiatric Association in their definitive clinical

14

guidance, which comes out about once every 10 years,

15

is -- is very explicit that the adaptive-deficit inquiry

16

focuses on deficits and not on strengths, and for two

17

very, very important reasons.

18

And the first is that -- is the clinical

19

inquiry is about the degree to which somebody is

20

impaired in their everyday life, and so it's focusing on

21

the impairments.

22

a very common stereotype and misunderstanding that if

23

somebody has strengths, they're not intellectually

24

disabled.

And the second reason is that there is

And both of those authoritative sources of

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the professional

organizations by, I suppose, a majority vote or

3

something like that conclude one thing, and but there

are respected experts who disagree, you're saying the

5

State is obligated --

MR. SLOAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

Well, I --- as a matter of

constitutional law to follow the organizations?
MR. SLOAN:

I'm not saying that, Your Honor.

10

As I said to Justice Kennedy, I think Hall identifies

11

considerations if the court is going to disagree.

12

the first one I mentioned was, is there a clinical

13

consensus on this point.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

And can I ask whether you

15

might be talking about two different things?

16

might be wrong about this, but as I understand adaptive

17

functioning, there are these particular areas of

18

functioning that have been set out.

19

consensus is, is to say, well, if you have deficits in

20

four of these areas, it doesn't matter that you don't

21

have a deficit in another area.

22

consensus is.

23
24
25

And I

And what the

And that's what the

And if you

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

My suspicion is that there

11

is no such thing, but that's why I asked the question.

12

I want to be sure.

13

There might be.

MR. SLOAN:

Well, let me make two points,

14

which is that, first of all, Your Honor says what --

15

what do courts do?

16

the general principle this Court was clear about in

17

Hall, which is being informed by the medical community

18

about diagnostic --

19

And I do think it's important that

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand.

But you are

20

saying whatever they should do, it shouldn't be what

21

went on here.

Okay.

I got that point.

22

I'm asking a different point.

23

want my true motive, I don't think there is a way to

24

apply this kind of standard uniformly across the

25

country, and therefore, there will be disparities, and

Alderson Reporting Company

And if you

uncertainties, and different people treated alike, and

2

-- and people who are alike treated differently.

3

Now, that's my whole story.

4

to say, no, you're wrong, there is a way to do it.

5

What?

6

MR. SLOAN:

Okay?

And I want you

Well, Your Honor, I -- I think

7

actually the best places to look on this would be the

8

AAIDD current manual, the 11th edition, as well as the

9

pages in the DSM-5 that -- that address it.

And it

10

actually points up an important difference in the

11

current standards because, for the first time, the 11th

12

edition, because of this problem about stereotypes, that

13

if people have strengths, they can't be considered

14

intellectually disabled.

15

For the first time, the current 11th

16

edition, the very one that the Court said was off limits

17

here, has an entirely new chapter, chapter 12, about the

18

issues and problems of people who have high IQ -- who

19

are intellectually disabled, but they are at the high IQ

20

end, exactly the group of people that Your Honor is

21

talking about.

22

manual, for the first time, has a list of harmful

23

stereotypes which includes exactly that.

24
25

And the user's guide accompanying that

And the other thing, Your Honor, though,
that I do have to emphasize, is that whatever one thinks

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

about the application across the country, there is no

2

question that Texas is very extreme and stands alone in

3

its view that -- of basically disagreeing with the core

4

premise of Atkins, and repeatedly in its decisions,

5

drawing distinctions between those who are severely

6

mentally retarded in many of the decisions, and those

7

who are mildly, and saying that there is no bright line

8

exemption for those who are mildly.

9

And also, in Briseno itself, the Court

10

said -- the Court of Criminal Appeals said, our task is

11

to decide what a consensus of Texas citizens thinks the

12

line should be.

just decided for Eighth Amendment purposes the consensus

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. KELLER:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Petitioner conceded that we could have used

the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-5 that answers the

25

question presented.

And Petitioner, in their reply

2

language in Texas's standard, which is based on the

3

AAMR 9th Clinical Framework, and current clinical

4

frameworks.

discussion of the seven Briseno evidentiary factors.

6

And if I can put those into context, the

So, essentially, this case has shifted to a

7

seven Briseno factors are all grounded in this Court's

8

precedents.

9

pages 53 to 55 of our brief, what those go to are the

10

second prong of the clinical definition, the adaptive

11

deficits inquiry.

12

As we point out in our bullet-point list at

All of those questions are asking, can

13

someone function in the world?

And that's precisely

14

what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted when it also

15

endorsed the Briseno factors.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You describe these as

17

coming from some source, but Briseno itself listed

18

this -- these -- seven, was it? -- bullet points, did

19

not give a single citation of where any one came from.

20

MR. KELLER:

It did, however, and this

21

Court -- in -- in pages 53 to 55 of our brief, we go

22

factor by factor and quote this Court's precedence to

23

show how they're congruent with factors that this Court

24

itself has considered.

25

And also, at Petition Appendix 162a, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

trial court adopted Petitioner's proposed conclusions of

2

law.

second prong, that adaptive deficit prong, even under

the current AAIDD 11th, quote, "answered many of the

5

Briseno factors," unquote.

And that said that analyzing the facts under that

6

So the analysis that's done under the second

7

prong of the clinical framework, the adaptive deficits

8

prong, that is going to overlap with the Briseno

9

factors.

And so this is not a free floating test that

10

negates or obviates the three-prong established test

11

that Texas uses, and it is part of the national

12

consensus --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, would you agree

14

with this:

That the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in

15

Briseno and other places, has made clear its view that

16

-- that Texas can choose to execute people whom a -- a

17

complete consensus, a 100 percent consensus of

18

clinicians, would find to be intellectually disabled?

19

Would you agree with that?

20

MR. KELLER:

I -- I don't believe that's

21

what the Briseno opinion said.

22

said was it was going to adopt clinical standards.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What the Briseno opinion

I'm -- I'm asking about

Briseno and other court of appeals' decisions.
And I thought that you said this in your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

brief, that the -- that your view of the point of State

2

discretion is that a person who everybody -- every

3

clinician would find to be intellectually disabled, the

4

State does not have to find to be intellectually

5

disabled because a consensus of Texas citizens would not

6

find that person to be intellectually disabled.

7

9

Isn't that the premise of the court of
appeals' decisions?
MR. KELLER:

No.

Quite the contrary.

11

language in the opinion.

17

it adopted the AAMR 9th clinical standards and the Texas

19

It was not going to do that.

But

That was

And instead what the Court did was

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I just don't

20

understand this.

And I really don't understand it in

21

light of your brief, which I'm going to start to quote

22

from pretty soon.

23

the Texas court did is to say, look, we're going to

24

accept the three dimensions, the adaptive deficits and

25

the IQ and the age.

But what the -- it seems to me what

But with respect to the quality and

Alderson Reporting Company

2

language -- we're not going to accept the clinicians'

3

view so that people with mild impairment can be

4

executed, even though the clinicians would find those

5

people to be intellectually disabled.

6

MR. KELLER:

Briseno very clearly adopted

7

the three-prong established test in cases since then

8

that we've cited throughout our brief.

9

that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We also applied

11

three-prong test.

12

impairment as to each of these -- those prongs.

13

The question is the degree of

And again, it seems to me pretty clear from

14

your brief when you're talking about Atkins didn't

15

establish a national standard, that you're saying too

16

that the Texas -- and if you're not, I mean, I -- I

17

guess I'm surprised by that -- that you're saying that

18

the Texas courts do need to follow clinical assessments

19

of intellectual impairment?

20

not what you say on page 19 and 20 and 21 of your brief.

21

MR. KELLER:

Because that's -- it's just

Court has recognized there is a different between a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Go back to

4

I'm sorry.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, he was talking about

my question.

5

So go on.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. KELLER:

8

Also, even the DSM-5 itself, the current

9

framework the Petitioner points to, says there is an

Thank you, Justice Kagan.

10

imperfect fit between those two concepts, and this Court

11

has cited that exact language in previous DSM versions

12

for that same proposition.

13

And so, no, it is not the case that States

14

have to categorically wholesale adopt the positions of

15

current medical organizations, but what Briseno itself

16

actually did was, in fact, adopt the AAMR 9th, the

17

precursor to the AAIDD 11th.

18

brief now says there's really no material difference

19

between the 11th and the ninth language.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Justice Kagan,

please.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let me just take one of the

7

Briseno factors, right?

8

people think about the person growing up is relevant to

9

an assessment of adaptive function.

10

And it's the idea that what lay

Now, no clinician would ever say that.

The

11

clinicians say, no, that's sort of like stereotypical

12

layperson view of adaptive functioning, which is

13

different from the -- the clinical view of adaptive

14

functioning.

15

sort of point one, that you're supposed to sort of --

16

that you're supposed to rely on -- on what the neighbor

17

said and what the teacher with absolutely no experience

18

with respect to intellectual disabilities said.

19

But the Briseno factors made very clear,

So that seems to me a very big difference

20

between the Briseno factors and the clinical view of

21

intellectual disability.

22

MR. KELLER:

This Court in Hall looked at

But this is actually probative evidence of whether --

That's going to depend on the totality of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because Briseno says

essentially that this can trump everything, and it says

10

that this can trump everything because of the underlying

11

view of Briseno and other Texas Court of Appeals cases

12

that we don't have to look at the clinical standards and

13

that we can execute people whom clinicians would find to

14

be disabled.

15

MR. KELLER:

No, Briseno did not say that

16

the seven evidentiary factors can trump the established

17

three-pronged definition that Texas has consistently

18

applied.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. General

20

Keller, because you keep on saying the three-prong

21

definition, but the three-prong definition just tells

22

you, you have to look to IQ, you have to look to

there could be other circumstances or other facts in the

These are different ways of phrasing how you do the

No.

The four cases I

just mentioned, these are cited at page 422.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, General,

3

there are going to be cases in which the Briseno factors

4

will show disabled, but that's not the question.

5
6

The question is can they be an exhaustive
list.

7

MR. KELLER:

The Briseno factors are not an

8

exhaustive list, and the CCA has never treated them like

9

that.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the -- but the genesis

11

of these factors was that the court said the clinical

12

standards are just too subjective and they don't reflect

13

what Texas citizens think, both of those things.

14

are too subjective, and they just reflect what

15

clinicians think; they don't reflect what Texas citizens

16

think.

17

suggests that Justice Kennedy is right about how they

18

operate and also how they were intended to operate.

19

They

That was the genesis of the standards, which

MR. KELLER:

The court did mention

20

subjectivity.

The Texas consensus point though was not

21

part of the basis to do it.

22

trying to do here was take the adaptive-deficit prong,

23

which is phrased in the terms of related and significant

24

limitations in adaptive functioning, and put that into

25

more concrete terms where you could apply it to a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Basically, there are two

things wrong, possibly, with the factors which we've

heard.

5

argument.

6

briefs -- one by one, and say reading them, actually,

7

they're not consistent with or they reflect an error

8

when compared with what the psychiatrists and

9

psychologists think.

One I can't deal with at this moment in oral
You could go through them -- they're in the

Your answer is they don't.

10

other side says they do.

11

that here.

12

Okay.

The

I can't go further with

The other is the question of, why did the

13

Texas court write these standards?

14

in reading through Briseno, I came to at least pause

15

when I read the words that they are trying to figure out

16

what to do in borderline cases, and what they have done

17

is not -- you know, I understand it, but they say we

18

have to figure out the level at which a consensus of

19

Texas citizens would agree that a person should be

20

exempted from the death penalty.

21

I have to admit that

When I read that, and when I read, there are

22

some other words -- that's on page 6 of the -- of the

23

report, of the reported opinion -- when I read some

24

other things that they said, I thought they were trying

25

to do this, which we do often in law.

Alderson Reporting Company

But what's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

purpose of this?

2

out who not to execute because of their functioning, the

3

way they function.

4

The whole purpose is to try to figure

That's the purpose.

Let's look at what Texas citizens would

5

think about this person, and let's try to get standards

6

that reflect that.

7

were trying to do in that opinion.

8

that that's the wrong thing to try to do in this

9

instance.

I really did think that's what they
And they are arguing

10

First, because it would produce

11

nonuniformity among 50 states or among the many states

12

that have the death penalty.

13

Second, because the question is not what the

14

citizens of the state think about who should be

15

executed.

16

enough, in this case, what has to do with it is a

17

technical matter about this individual, that would free

18

some while subjecting others to the death penalty,

19

irrespective of what Texas citizens think.

20

That has nothing to do with it.

So do you see my question?

21

up to in this opinion?

22

to going back to the citizens of Texas.

23

think they are up to.

24

wrong or why.

25

MR. KELLER:

Briseno.

Oddly

What were they

I think they were up
You saw what I

And you tell me if I'm right,

Justice Breyer, I -- I believe

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

that's mistaken, because there are two points after that

2

discussion in Texas consensus where the Court says, and

3

this is page 6 of Briseno, as a Court dealing with

4

individual cases and litigants, we decline to answer

5

that normative question about the Texas consensus

6

without the significant greater assistance from the

7

citizenry acting through its legislature.

8

pages later, it's again assessing the difference between

9

legal determination and the medical diagnosis, and the

10

Court says that definitional question is not before us

11

in this case, because it goes on to adopt the AAMR 9th

12

Clinical Standards.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And then two

Mr. General, going --

14

just -- is it your view that what Texas is trying to do

15

is determine who is truly on the clinical borderline as

16

opposed to trying to determine the type of mentally

17

disabled people that it thinks should be executed --

18

MR. KELLER:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. KELLER:

21

clinical definitions in the AAMR 9.

22

Correct.

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- on the latter?
Texas has adopted

All right.

So is it

23

fair to say that in Texas, a mildly disabled person is

24

unlikely to be considered disabled by the CCA under the

25

Briseno factors?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

MR. KELLER:

No.

If there was a diagnosis

2

of intellectual disability, even mild intellectual

3

disability, that would satisfy the --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you -- according to

5

one of the cases that you've cited to me where someone

6

was clinically diagnosed as mildly disabled, and the CCA

7

said under the Briseno factors that they should not be

8

executed.

9

there was clinical evidence of moderate -- and mostly

A lot of the cases that you provided me with,

10

severe -- but moderate to severe disability.

11

there -- was there anyone with mild disability that the

12

Briseno factors would find sufficiently disabled?

13

MR. KELLER:

But

Well, Justice Sotomayor, the

14

Van Alstyne case is the case that I can point to where

15

the CCA looked at the Briseno factors and granted her

16

leave.

17

If I can pull back up the question --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

Did they find him mildly

disabled?
MR. KELLER:

The testimony there was on

21

adaptive deficits.

22

it's mild or moderate would go more towards IQ scores.

23

And I believe the mild -- whether

If I can pull back out:

So the question

24

presented here is whether Texas has prohibited the

current standards from being used and is erring by using

outdated standards.

prohibiting the use of current standards.

the CCA repeatedly quoted -- it cited --

And Texas is not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In this case,

So why did it go through

6

so much trouble in saying that it wasn't going to use

7

current standards, that it was only going to use the

8

older standards and the Briseno factors?

9

MR. KELLER:

Because the current standard

10

used by AAIDD 11th does not have the relatedness

11

inquiry.

12

case.

13

was the main reason why the CCA said, trial court,

14

you're not following our precedence.

And now, that is an extraneous part of this

It was a second alternative holding.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that

That's error.

Well, if we believe that

16

its definition of relatedness has no support anywhere,

17

would that have been a valid reason for discounting the

18

current clinical standards?

19

MR. KELLER:

Well, that was a second

20

alternative holding.

Here, it's facially valid for

21

Texas and any other State to have a relatedness

22

requirement.

23

about needing something to be directly related, but it

24

doesn't flesh that out.

25

is the application of that.

That's in the DSM-5.

The DSM-5 talks

So what we were talking about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

And this would be an odd case to decide that

issue.

When it's a second alternative holding, there is

3

no State consensus on this causation point.

5

the reply brief.

6

the relatedness inquiry was the dispositive point on

7

which an Atkins claim was denied.

8
9

That's the

We are not aware of any case in which

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I'm not sure how I

can accept your characterization of the CCA decision

10

when basically it's saying his poor intellectual

11

functioning on IQ tests, which happened when he was

12

younger, were not related to his intellectual abilities;

13

they were related to his poverty, his -- his morbidity

14

factors.

15

If they are saying that, how are you saying

16

they weren't finding that he wasn't intellectually

17

disabled because of those other factors?

18

MR. KELLER:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. KELLER:

22

saying that.

23

Petitioner argued --

25

That's how I read their

decision.

21

24

Well, it wasn't just --

Well, it wasn't just the CCA

It was relying on testimony.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Here,

Well, wait a minute.

The testimony of Compton was, having looked at all of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

the IQ tests, was:

2

he's intellectually disabled by IQ, but he wouldn't

3

qualify in my judgment because of his adaptive skills.

4

But even the State's own expert said that it was

5

probable that he was intellectually disabled.

6

I'm not sure.

MR. KELLER:

It's probable that

The State's expert said that it

7

would have been borderline on intellectual functioning.

8

But the CCA on relatedness -- and, again, this is a

9

second alternative holding that the Court doesn't have

10

to reach -- it looked at testimony from Petitioner's

11

retrial in 2001 when Petitioner affirmatively argued

12

that he was not intellectually disabled.

13

there that was Petitioner's own expert agreed.

14
15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the expert

It was a strategic

advantage to doing that back in those days; right?
MR. KELLER:

Well, actually, at the time,

17

Penry would have been decided, and there would have been

18

a valid basis to say, Petitioner, I'm intellectually

19

disabled; therefore, use it as mitigation evidence.

20

strategy, which was a reasonable strategy from counsel,

21

was to say that Petitioner would be able to grow in

22

prison, and, therefore, that was mitigation evidence

23

that he could be reformed.

24
25

The

But, right, the Petitioner expert agreed
with the prosecutor the Petitioner was, quote, nowhere

2

of education was to blame.

4

That's at Joint Appendix

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that happened in

Atkins, too.

disability was a ground to excuse execution, many

mentally disabled defendants were represented by counsel

strategy.

contradicting argument.

testimony as the most reliable expert who is the only

the deficits for diagnosis.

20

And that's why that's a
Regardless, even if that's not

And Compton said, I don't have

But this is a fact-bound question of the

21

application of the test.

The question presented here is

22

whether Texas' well-established, three-prong test for

23

intellectual disability violates the Eighth Amendment.

24

And Texas is well within the national consensus.

25

are only four States that have categorically wholesale

Alderson Reporting Company

There

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

adopted one of the current frameworks.

2

so saying there's no material difference in the language

3

between the current framework and that test.

4

the precise position the Petitioner has taken in the

5

reply brief.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Two of them did

And that's

Can you explain why Texas

7

applies a different test to determine whether a school

8

child is intellectually disabled, or a juvenile

9

offender, to determine what to do with that offender,

10

Texas applies a different test when compatible with

11

current medical standards in both of those categories?

12

Why does it have a different standard for capital cases

13

only?

14

MR. KELLER:

So first of all, the juvenile

15

offender discharge rule that Petitioner cites at page 7

16

of the reply brief, that actually adopts the three-prong

17

test that Briseno adopted.

18

Administrative Code 380.8779(c)(1).

19

That's 37 Texas

Now, there are other provisions that

20

incorporate by reference the latest manual of the DSM.

21

But as the DSM-5 itself noted, there is an imperfect fit

22

between a determination of legal -- a legal

23

determination of culpability for Eighth Amendment

24

purposes and a medical diagnosis.

25

those different purposes, it is valid for a State to

Alderson Reporting Company

And since you have

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

have a different definition of when someone is morally

2

culpable under the Eighth Amendment versus when someone

3

should be able to get social-services benefit.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's the point.

5

That's exactly the point.

That's the point that we've

6

been making, or at least I thought we were.

7

whole point of Briseno is really to answer the question

8

that you said -- probably should say, no, it isn't

9

really there -- it's to help determine which persons

That the

10

suffering borderline cases of mental disability ought to

11

be executed, or should not be because they are less

12

morally culpable.

13

Now, I did think that's what they said.

14

That does supply a reason for making differences, as

15

Justice Ginsburg just pointed out.

16

question is, is it what the purpose of Atkins and the

17

other case Hall was, was it to give each State the right

18

to decide in borderline cases whom or whom not to

19

execute in light of their feelings about capital

20

punishment?

21

And then the

I thought it had a different purpose --

22

unusual in the law -- but which was to appeal to

23

technical definitions of who and who is not mentally

24

retarded or intellectually disabled.

25

issue.

That's a real

But I think that this case does present that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1
2

issue.
MR. KELLER:

And what Atkins and Hall said

3

was there's a critical role for the States.

And while

4

States don't have unfettered discretion, they do have

5

some discretion.

6

edition of the AAIDD 11th -- or 12th comes out, the

7

States don't have to automatically wholesale about that,

8

because there is a well-established three-prong test.

9

This test has existed for 50 years.

And every time the DSM-5 or the next

And the States --

10

there's a national consensus adopting that test.

11

There's not a national consensus against the

12

relatedness-inquiries causation.

13

national consensus that the various factors of the

14

Briseno factor-of-an-entry test can't be applied.

15

There is not a

And on adaptive strengths in particular, no

16

State prohibits the use of adaptive strengths.

In fact,

17

three of the States that use the current frameworks,

18

that have adopted wholesale the current frameworks,

19

still look at adaptive strengths.

20

Pennsylvania is the best example of that.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The Hackett case from

Well, the problem is

22

that, as I read the CCA opinion, it's looking at

23

adaptive strengths only and not at adaptive deficits and

24

looking at the depth of them or how they form the

25

intellectual disability component.

Alderson Reporting Company

Even Dr. Compton,

they're not products of his intellectual disability.

14

the other deficits?

15

MR. KELLER:

Lennie, and the character from

part of the test.

the Court said it was not going to address that separate

question and instead adopted the clinical standards.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

of how to judge the lack or strength of adaptive

MR. KELLER:

we can see that, not only from the fact that what

briefing here.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

General, can I ask -- I'm

10

sort of trying to reconcile the various statements you

11

made here, and in your briefs, and here's what I come up

12

with, and tell me if it's right.

13

I think what you're saying is the Texas

14

Court of Appeals is complying with Atkins because it

15

used a three-pronged test, focusing on IQ and adaptive

16

function and age.

17

order to make this distinction between clinical

18

disability and moral culpability within each of those

19

prongs, the Court can choose how to apply that prong,

20

and particularly what levels of impairment to use.

21

Is that a fair assessment?

22

MR. KELLER:

23

But within each of those prongs, in

Mr. Chief Justice, may I

answer?

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. KELLER:

Sure.

Sure.

I don't believe so, Justice

the clinical prongs.

It has adopted the three-part

adopted the three-part test.

6

prongs, you get to apply it.

7

I -- yes, it has

I thought that that was the entire point of

8

Hall:

No, that's wrong.

9

however you want.

10

MR. KELLER:

You don't get to apply it

But on intellectual

11

functioning, Texas has never had an IQ cutoff.

12

recognized, it applied the -- the error of measurement.

13

And even on the adaptive prong analysis, that is going

14

to account for conceptual, social, and practical skills

15

as Texas has actually adopted the current standards.

Three minutes, Mr. Sloan.

18

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20
21

As Hall

MR. SLOAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Just a

few brief points.

22

First, there was a lot of discussion about

23

the role of Briseno and the relationship to clinical

24

standards in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals'

25

decisions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

54
1

And I would suggest that the Court look at

2

the American Bar Association amicus brief because it

3

goes through three decisions of the Court of Criminal

4

Appeals where in each of those three decisions, the

5

clinical testimony, the expert testimony, was unanimous

6

that the individual was intellectually disabled, and the

7

Texas courts used the Briseno factors to conclude that,

8

in fact, he was eligible for execution notwithstanding

9

the unanimity of that expert testimony.

10

Second, my friend said that I conceded that

11

they could have just applied the DSM-IV and rejected the

12

DSM-5.

13

I did not concede that.

14

Just to -- to be clear, and just for the record,

And in my response to Justice Kennedy, I was

15

saying that if a court -- if a State is going to reject

16

clinical consensus and in the current clinical standard,

17

as in that example, then there would be a number of

18

factors that the court would look at.

19

And what I didn't get to was, and very

20

importantly, is the Eighth Amendment principles and

21

concerns that this Court outlined in Hall and in Atkins,

22

and the absolute requirement to ensure that somebody who

23

is intellectually disabled is not going to be executed.

24
25

Third, one point about Chief Justice's
initial question that I never quite got to about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

55
1

question presented, in addition to the fact that, as we

2

did discuss, its interwoven with the Briseno decision.

3

In the cert papers themselves, in our cert

4

petition and our reply, we repeatedly used the phrases

5

like "nonclinical," "unscientific," "standards

6

completely untethered to clinical consensus."

7

indeed, the State, in its opposition to the cert

8

petition, rested heavily on the Briseno factors.

9

is a few pages of their opposition that are specifically

10

directed to that.

11

discussed in the cert papers at the time.

12

And,

There

So there -- that was very extensively

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you just clarify what

13

you said about DSM-IV and DSM-5, because I had a

14

different impression from your initial argument.

15

So if we were to say today every State must

16

adopt DSM-5, and then at some point in the future DSM-6

17

Thank you, Your Honor.
