ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

To determine whether a power of attorney

11

confers authority to enter into an arbitration

12

agreement, Kentucky applies the rule different and more

13

demanding than the rule for determining whether a power

14

of attorney confers authority to enter into contracts

15

generally.

16

The question in this case is whether the

17

Federal Arbitration Act precludes Kentucky from erecting

18

the special obstacle to enforce arbitration agreements

19

signed by an attorney-in-fact.

20

believe, is to answer it.

21

Congress enacted the FAA, to prevent discriminatory

22

rules targeting arbitration agreements.

23

To ask that question, we

That's the very reason that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose Kentucky had a

24

statute providing that an attorney-in-fact lacks

25

authority to do a -- a -- a number of things:

Alderson Reporting Company

Convey

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

real property, move the principal's residence out of

2

state, invest in foreign real estate, a few more

3

examples like that, or sign an arbitration clause --

4

arbitration contract.

5

statute, I know.

6

That's -- that's not this

But at -- at some point, can arbitration

7

clauses be included in a -- in a list of items that must

8

be given special attention?

9

MR. PINCUS:

At some point they can, Your

10

Honor.

11

course, refers to rules that apply to any contract.

12

This Court has talked about contracts generally.

13

don't think that -- that means that the rule has to

14

apply to every single contract no matter what.

And I think the dividing line -- the statute, of

15

We

If the rule takes its meaning from a

16

characteristic other than arbitration, to give an

17

example, if a -- if a State had a law that said all

18

consumer contracts have to be in at least 10-point type,

19

surely the court -- the State could apply that law to an

20

arbitration agreement associated with a consumer

21

contract.

22

The problem, obviously, arises if there's

23

some gerrymandering that puts arbitration in a special

24

category.

25

several reasons, one of which is even the categories

And -- and we think the rule here fails for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

that the State court said it was erecting really don't

2

hold up based on the objective evidence.

3

importantly, the reason that arbitration was included in

4

this category is the very reason that the FAA forbids,

5

which is the conclusion by the State that arbitration --

6

an arbitration contract is especially onerous, and

7

therefore, should be classed with other especially

8

onerous contracts.

9

designed to prevent.

10
11
12

But also more

That's exactly what the FAA was
So that's the -- the problem here.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how about a different

example, but more related in my mind right now.
Under Kentucky law, let's say, the power of

13

attorney requirements are strictly construed.

14

one of the principles that the court below used to

15

interpret at least one of the contracts.

16

general matter, it states that the State requires

17

express consent to confer power to waive any fundamental

18

constitutional right.

19
20
21

That was

And as a

Would this general principle be preempted by
the FFA -- by the FAA?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, let me distinguish

22

between those -- those two general principles, Your

23

Honor, if I may.

24
25

I think a principle of strict construction,
fairly applied across a wide category of contracts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

probably is something; in other words, if it applied to

2

all powers of attorney probably is something that would

3

pass muster under the FAA, again, recognizing that a

4

court would have to take care that that notwithstanding

5

the general rule, there wasn't some

6

discrimination-in-fact against arbitration.

7
8

I think the question about a fundamental
rights line, let me answer that in two ways.

9

First of all, in this case, we don't believe

10

that that's in fact what happened because we think there

11

are a number of fundamental rights that are not

12

categorized in the group that the State court mentioned.

13

And, in fact, what the State court did was identify four

14

or five especially onerous examples of intrusion on

15

fundamental rights and say they -- these are all like

16

arbitration.

17

example.

18

process rights.

19

covered; the right to property, et cetera, et cetera.

20

It didn't say all fundamental rights, for

Foreign selection clauses may waive due
There's no indication that they're

I think -- so that's not this case.

If

21

there were a fundamental rights rule, I think the

22

problem that it presents is whether that intrudes on the

23

judgment that the FAA made, that arbitration contracts

24

are not especially onerous as other waivers of

25

fundamental rights may be; and therefore, I think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

case would -- it's obviously different than this one.

2

The Court doesn't have to reach it, but we

3

think even in that case, grouping an arbitration

4

contract with a contract to enter into a guilty plea or

5

something like that, I think is troublesome because it

6

really puts arbitration agreements in the very category

7

that Congress said they shouldn't be in.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about if the category

were fundamental rights that implicate the -- the

10

individual's life or health, so that you would have to

11

have an express provision giving the attorney-in-fact

12

authorization to consent to various procedures that a

13

terminally ill person might undergo, and if this were

14

put in that category?

15
16

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I -- I -- I just want to

make sure I understand your hypothetical, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in this case, what's

18

involved here is care for a -- a person who is unable to

19

look after that -- that person's own care, an elderly

20

person, a disabled person in a -- in a nursing facility.

21

So what if that were lumped together with

22

consent to surgery, consent to terminate feeding, or --

23

or breathing for a terminally-ill patient.

24

could be put into a category that implicate life or

25

health.

Alderson Reporting Company

All of those

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

MR. PINCUS:

They could.

I -- I don't think

2

an arbitration agreement would -- would fall into that

3

same category of implicating life and health.

4

and also, I think it's important to recognize that --

5

that, again, here the State court didn't say that all

6

decisions implicating life or health are subject to its

7

special express requirement.

8

a couple of -- an abortion or adoption.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And --

It -- it -- it identified

Well, in Justice Alito's

10

example, just to take it a little further, suppose the

11

nursing home said you cannot enter here unless you sign

12

the arbitration agreement, and this is the -- this is

13

the only place where this person can go for care.

14

brings it closer to some of Justice Alito's examples

15

because now there's a danger that the care can't be

16

rendered.

17

MR. PINCUS:

That

Well, interestingly, what

18

the -- the Kentucky court held in another case, Ping,

19

that -- that actually a -- the power to make health

20

decisions would be interpreted to include the power to

21

enter into an arbitration agreement if arbitration were

22

a condition of admission.

23

wasn't a condition of admission, it didn't apply that

24

rationale.

25

But in this case, because it

I -- I -- I think -- I guess the distinction

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

here seems to me the decisions about health that we're

2

talking about; operations, medicine, are a category of

3

important decisions that the State has the power to

4

decide about.

5

The -- the -- the problem with the -- with

6

the hypotheticals is that the FAA basically says the

7

State doesn't have the power to treat arbitration

8

agreements specially on the theory that they impose some

9

special burden on the parties to the arbitration

10

agreement.

11

lump them together with those other decisions runs afoul

12

of the FAA.

And so I think a decision by the State to

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. PINCUS:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the --

Again, not in this case.
But the context here seems

16

different from the arbitration cases that we've had in

17

recent years.

18

about the amount that you were charged for your cable

19

bill or for your telephone bill.

20

situation where an elderly person needs care.

21

This doesn't involve an -- an arbitration

This involves a

And as Justice Kennedy's hypothetical

22

mentioned, it may be that the only facility that's

23

available, or all of the facilities, require the signing

24

of an -- an arbitration agreement which prevents the

25

assertion of tort claims and the -- the elimination of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

the deterrents that they provide may really implicate

2

the care of someone who is vulnerable.

3

like something that is close to or that it falls

4

squarely within the police power of a State.

5

So this seems

Now, I suppose that there's a connection

6

here to interstate commerce, I don't know what exactly

7

it is, but on the assumption that everything is

8

connected to interstate commerce, I assume that this

9

falls within the FAA.

10

But you see the problem?

This is really

11

taking the arbitration precedence that we have handed

12

down in recent years into a different category of

13

interests.

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, respectfully, I don't --

15

I don't think so, Your Honor.

16

unanimously decided the Marmet case a few years ago,

17

which involved this precise context:

18

agreement in the nursing home context.

19

of the arguments that was advanced in -- in opposing --

20

in supporting the rationale that the arbitration clause

21

shouldn't be enforced was that tort claims and the

22

nursing home context is different.

23

expressly rejected that criteria.

The -- the courts

An arbitration
And there, one

And the Court

24

And I think Congress's judgment in the

25

FAA -- and Congress has specifically looked at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

nursing home context in recent years; there have been a

2

number of hearings and examinations -- is that there

3

isn't a difference between deciding claims in

4

arbitration or in court.

5

the case, I think, recite some of the empirical data

6

that, in fact, in the nursing home context and in other

7

contexts, arbitration results for claimants are quite

8

similar.

9

is cheaper and faster.

And the amicus briefs filed in

The differences are it's cheaper, the process

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with the

11

argument that this doesn't have to do with the

12

enforcement of an arbitration agreement?

13

question of whether the agreement was ever formed or

14

made.

15

attorney, the power to enter into arbitration

16

agreements, so it's a question that goes to making that

17

enforcement.

It goes to the

That is, if it takes outside the power of

18

MR. PINCUS:

Well, two answers, Your Honor.

19

I -- I -- I think it does go to enforcement because

20

really the question here is what the Kentucky court

21

said:

22

document in a way that renders the arbitration agreement

23

unenforceable.

24

the other requisites of contract formation were not

25

present.

We are interpreting the power of attorney

I don't think anyone argues that any of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

But, also, this Court has never drawn a

2

distinction between contract formation and

3

enforceability in applying the FAA.

4

so would open a dramatic hole in -- in the FAA, because

5

it would be quite easy for a State to say, for example,

6

an arbitration agreement requires notarization; no other

7

contract does.

8

properly formed, must contain a provision that allows it

9

to be revocable at will.

10

And I think to do

Or an arbitration agreement, to be

And so it would be quite easy to -- to -- if

11

formation was ruled off limits, to allow very easy

12

circumvention of the protections of the FAA.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what about the

14

Wellner -- the Wellner documents.

15

court said in the first part of its discussion about

16

that, it just interpreted the power of attorney as not

17

reaching arbitration.

18

its ordinary powers of contract interpretation.

19

As I read what the

So there it was just exercising

MR. PINCUS:

I think Wellner is closer to

20

the -- to the issue that the court confronted in

21

Imburgia, whether that really was an ordinary contract

22

interpretation.

23

for enforcing it is that it expressly provides the

24

authority to contract with respect to personal property.

25

And it's been long settled under Kentucky law that

And as we've explained, the argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

choses in action, clauses of action are personal

2

property.

3

The court didn't apply that precedent, and

4

that seems to us to be exactly as in Imburgia:

5

situation where a generally applicable rule was not

6

applied in the arbitration context.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- a

Well, do you think every

8

time a State court incorrectly interprets a power of

9

attorney relating to -- as it relates to arbitration,

10

that that raises an FAA preemption issue?

11

MR. PINCUS:

I think the question is whether

12

the State court's decision fails to put an arbitration

13

agreement on an equal footing, as the -- as the Court

14

has said.

15

occasion or the ability for the Court to review all of

16

those decisions.

17

I -- obviously, there's not going to be the

I think in this case there's obviously a

18

difference between the Clark situation where there was

19

no argument that the power of attorney was ambiguous; in

20

fact, the State court said it wasn't.

21

applying a new legal rule.

22

there is this question about whether or not it was

23

ambiguous.

24

test, it -- it really can't be said to be ambiguous,

25

given the long-standing rule under Kentucky law and the

That's just

In the Clark situation,

But we think under -- under any reasonable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

fact that the -- the power of attorney there, in a

2

separate provision, conveyed the authority to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. PINCUS:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. --

-- bringing Federal lawsuits.
Following up on Justice

6

Alito's question, and I know Ping is not before us, but

7

applying your arguments to Ping, because the author of

8

Ping dissented in these two cases, do you think Ping is

9

closer to the neutral application of a contract

10

interpretation?

11

MR. PINCUS:

I do, because the -- what the

12

court relied on in Ping was the absence of any general

13

authority to contract and the fact that the broader --

14

all -- what Ping provided for was the ability to -- to

15

invest funds, the ability to make health decisions,

16

and -- and the ability to essentially administer real

17

property.

18

the making of contracts or the making of contracts with

19

respect to personal property.

It didn't have a general clause relating to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. PINCUS:

22

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

I see --

There was some --

No, no.

say, Wellner is a little closer.
MR. PINCUS:

Wellner is --

Alderson Reporting Company

I was going to

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1
2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it seems to me

that --

3

MR. PINCUS:

The difference in Wellner is

4

that Wellner does have a very broad clause that provides

5

for the making of contracts with respect to personal

6

property.

7

personal property includes choses of -- clauses of

8

action, choses in action, it's pretty clear.

9

And given the fact that under Kentucky law,

And also in Wellner and not in Ping was a

10

separate provision that gave the attorney the power to

11

bring and prosecute lawsuits.

12

the fear was that that general power to contract with

13

respect to personal property somehow didn't extend to

14

litigation, there's a separate clause with respect to

15

litigation.

16

So if the -- if the -- if

Now, the Kentucky Court said that clause

17

alone isn't enough because it doesn't relate to

18

arbitration or to contracting, but it seems to me the

19

combination of them is pretty powerful in --

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a pretty

powerful --

22

MR. PINCUS:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- explaining what's going on.
That's a pretty weak

24

argument that they've automatically made a special rule

25

for arbitration.

They looked at, will the institute

16
1

settle and conduct litigation with no mention of

2

alternative dispute resolution and conveying personal

3

property, not necessarily contracting.

4

general contracting clause.

5

arguments on both sides of that question.

There wasn't a

So I think there's

6

If there is, what do you suggest we do?

7

MR. PINCUS:

Well, let me take a little bit

8

of issue with -- with your -- with the predicate of your

9

question, because the Wellner power does say to make,

10

execute, deliver deeds, releases, conveyances, and

11

contracts of every nature in relation to both real and

12

personal property.

13

provision that -- that was not present in Ping.

14

So I think that is a pretty broad

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And, Mr. Pincus, may I

15

ask you a question about the wrongful death action,

16

which everyone agrees does not belong to the patient; it

17

belongs to -- to the survivors.

18

negligence on the nursing home part would arise in the

19

patient's suit as in the survivor's suit.

And the same issues of

20

Now, who determines which one goes first?

21

Because if the -- if the survivor's action goes first

22

and the nursing home is found liable, wouldn't the

23

nursing home be bound by that in the arbitration?

24
25

MR. PINCUS:

I guess that, in the first

instance, would be a question of Kentucky law, Your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

Honor.

2

treats prior decisions.

3

different parties, I don't know whether Kentucky law

4

provides for offensive, non-mutual estoppel.

5

those would be the questions that would arise in that

6

context.

7

I'm not sure how Kentucky law in arbitration
And I also -- since there are

So I guess

Of course, the Court has said most recently

8

in the KPMG case that the fact that there are claims

9

that -- that could be bundled together doesn't mean that

10

the ones that are subject to an arbitration clause

11

shouldn't be sent to arbitration.

12

So just to -- to sort of return to first

13

principles and -- and to elaborate on my answer to

14

Justice Sotomayor's question, I -- there are two -- two

15

distinct issues in this case.

16

express reference rule that the Court announced and

17

applied with respect to Wellner in particular.

18

rule obviously also applies to the Clark power of

attorney -- I mean, applied in Clark with respect to the

20

Wellner power of attorney.

21

One is the general

That

There's the second question about whether

22

the -- the language that -- that I quoted is

23

sufficiently clear that a decision by the State court

24

that it is ambiguous triggers the same kind of a concern

25

that the Court identified in Imburgia as -- as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

indicating that this is really a special rule targeting

2

arbitration, as opposed to the application of a neutral

principle.

Unless the Court has any further questions,

I'll save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. SALYER

10

Thank you, Counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11
12

Thank

MR. SALYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

13

Kentucky is a common law State in the

14

development of its power of attorney interpretive law.

15

It is not a uniform power of attorney act State.

16

Therefore, over time, the Kentucky Supreme Court and the

17

lower courts of Kentucky developed Kentucky's

18

interpretive rules regarding powers of attorney case by

19

case, again, over time.

20

that the Kentucky Supreme Court has established in this

21

case below.

22

constitutional rights must be unambiguously expressed in

23

the text of a power of attorney.

And -- and this is the rule

The power to waive generally fundamental

24

Now --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is -- is there such an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

explicit reference in the power of attorney with respect

2

to anything other than arbitration agreements?

3

MR. SALYER:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is -- is there anything?
Is there an explicit

5

reference -- to be effective, you've just told us, the

6

power of attorney has to explicitly state the -- that

7

disputes will be settled by an arbitration.

8
9

My question is whether there is any other
contract that in order to be made effectively in

10

Kentucky, it must be an explicit reference in the power

11

of attorney.

12
13
14

MR. SALYER:

Oh, I -- I understand your --

your question, Justice Ginsburg.
From -- this is the announcing of this

15

particular rule, but logically, from here on out, any

16

such actions taken by an -- a -- an attorney-in-fact

17

that might restrict the principal's free speech rights,

18

say, by entering into a contract with a

19

non-disparagement clause or some sort of confidentiality

20

clause, that would necessarily have to be spelled out in

21

a power of attorney.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words -In other words -- in other

24

words, for a number of years Kentucky had allowed powers

of attorney and the first time that one was called into

question under this theory was with reference to the

arbitration.

3

MR. SALYER:

Well, Your Honor, here --

4

here's the thing about Kentucky powers of attorney.

5

has been the law of Kentucky since 1912 that powers of

6

attorney are to be strictly interpreted and that the --

7

the third party deals with the principal by an agent at

8

that third party's own peril.

9

and -- and incumbent upon that third party to be very

10

clear and understand what the agent is allowed to do.

11

And -- and -- and the fact is that it is -- the reason

12

that these cases have not come up is that the third

13

parties, the -- the banks, the -- the whatever that

14

are -- are receiving powers of attorney as authority of

15

agents for principals, they've always demanded very

16

explicit information in that power of attorney.

It

Therefore, it is up to

17

And this happens to be an instance where you

18

have the third party who doesn't -- who doesn't actually

19

want more explicit language in the power of attorney.

20

Have I answered your -- your -- yes, sir.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in Kentucky, I issue a

22

power of attorney to Jones and say, you have full power

23

to protect, defend and maximize the value of all my

24

property.

25

Okay.

That's what it says.

MR. SALYER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And someone claims that

2

this piece of land over here that we thought belonged to

3

Smith belongs to him under various deeds.

4

MR. SALYER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right?

Yes, Your Honor.
Now, the -- the attorney

6

says, in my opinion, I want this tried before a judge

7

because I think I'll get a fairer shake.

8

Illegal; right?

9
10

MR. SALYER:

Okay.

Are you making the distinction,

Your Honor, between --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you just said

12

anything that waives the right to a jury is illegal

13

unless it's explicitly there.

14

So, that's case one.

Case two, similar kind of argument, and the

15

lawyers for the two parties get together and say, we'd

16

like to settle this case.

17

they can't do it in Kentucky.

18

Can't have traces -- cases tried before a judge.

19

that right?

20
21

MR. SALYER:

Illegal; right?

No power,

Can't settle cases.

No, Your Honor.

Is

That --

that --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, that's not right.

23

I see.

24

isn't it right?

25

right of trial by jury is being -- you're giving the

Oh,

In other words, you -- you -- you -- why -- why
Because after all, the fundamental

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

attorney the power to refuse to have a jury.

2

MR. SALYER:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, Your Honor -So what's the difference

4

between that and the case we have, where we're not going

5

to have a mediator, we're not going to have settlement,

6

we're not going to have a judge trial, we're going to

7

have an arbitrator.

8
9

MR. SALYER:

Your Honor, the -- the

interpretive rule that the Kentucky Supreme Court

10

enunciated was the power to waive generally fundamental

11

constitutional rights.

12

the -- the person is going to waive their jury rights

13

in -- in general from now on --

14

The -- the idea that -- that

JUSTICE BREYER:

All he did was say that in

15

the attorney's judgment, if he wants to go to

16

arbitration and thinks that's best, he can do it.

17

I just don't see the difference between that and

18

implying, in the attorney's judgment, if he wants to

19

settle a case, rather than going to a jury, he can do

20

it.

21

case tried before a judge instead of a jury, he can do

22

it.

23

to think that a general power of attorney would give the

24

attorney the right to say, no jury, judge trial.

25

jury, mediator.

Now,

Or, if in the attorney's judgment, he would like a

And you're going to tell me that that's ridiculous

No

Oh, but it makes perfect sense to say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

no jury, arbitrary -- arbitrator.

2

Now, if you're not going to tell me that

3

those are treated exactly alike, I will tell you in my

4

opinion right now you have discriminated against

5

arbitration --

6

MR. SALYER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Well, Your Honor -Unless you can find some

difference.

9

MR. SALYER:

It seems to me that the

10

analogue to what you're -- you're proposing would be an

11

instance where the -- the attorney engaged with another

12

party never to have a jury trial with that party

13

pre-dispute just for a -- for from now on.

14

they're always going to go to mediation and never go

15

to --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or that

No, that isn't this.

You

17

say that a attorney -- I'll be repeating myself.

18

testing out whether it's really true.

19

highly suspicious as you can tell from my tone of voice.

20

What I really think has happened is that Kentucky just

21

doesn't like the Federal law.

22

So they're not going to follow it.

23

course, you're going to say, no, they would never do

24

that.

25

asked my question.

I'm

Of course I'm

That's what I suspect.
Now, that, of

So I'm trying to test this out.

And that's why I

Because it seems to me that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

arbitration as a means of settlement of a case, of a

2

dispute, mediation as a means of settling a dispute, a

3

judge as a means of settling a dispute, are equally and

4

no different in the respect that none of those three

5

involves a trial by jury.

6

So I just want to know -- and you have

7

already said, no, no, they're all different.

8

to me proves that they're treating arbitration

9

specially.

10

Well, that

So I put my whole argument there because I

want you to have an opportunity to reply.

11

MR. SALYER:

12

I -- I think that the -- the -- the

Thank you, Your Honor.

13

distinction that -- that would be made there is that

14

we're -- we're talking about an agreement that's

15

pre-dispute and waives a -- this particular right

16

vis-à-vis the nursing home resident and the nursing home

17

potentially in perpetuity.

18

And I guess the analogue to -- to a --

19

coming to an agreement to settle pre-dispute would be a

20

liquidated damages clause.

21

the Kentucky Supreme Court probably would not look very

22

favorably on an attorney-in-fact executing a liquidated

23

damages clause with a nursing home to settle any

24

potential personal injury that occurred at -- during the

25

nursing home resident's stay.

And I think that the -- that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

But I -- I actually want to get to -- to, if

2

I could, to a more overarching point in -- in this case;

3

and that is, the Federal Arbitration Act does not extend

4

this Court's powers of interpretation beyond agreements

5

to arbitrate.

6

proved the rule, and the rule applies here.

7

Moreover, DIRECTV was the exception that
Excuse me.

This Court does not ordinarily instruct

8

States in how to interpret the instruments and documents

9

that are governed by State law.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

your -- missed your point.

12

beyond what?

13
14

Now --

MR. SALYER:

And maybe I missed

The FAA does not extend

agreements to arbitrate and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Interpret --

16

interpreting them or anything with respect to them?

17

example, you're not arguing that if Kentucky had a law

18

saying you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that

19

would certainly be covered by the FAA.

20
21

MR. SALYER:

For

Yes, Your Honor, that --

that -- well, we believe, would be covered by the FAA.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- and if that

23

was a decision of a court that said, under our common

24

law you can't have agreements to arbitrate, that would

25

also?

2

MR. SALYER:

Totally not.

That's what the

Federal Arbitration Act is directly directed at.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, since we're

4

talking about laws that have an impact on agreements to

5

arbitrate, I guess I don't understand the effect of your

6

principle.

7

MR. SALYER:

Well, we're looking at the

8

black letter of Section 2, which provides that

9

agreements to arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable, and

10

enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist for the

11

revocation of any contract.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. SALYER:

14

arbitration agreements.

15

We have an absence of authority of the signator to this

16

arbitration agreement.

17

a -- a ground for revocation of any contract, absence of

18

authority.

19

Right.

That pertains specifically to
And so what do we have here?

That certainly should qualify as

Act extends.

arbitrability in certain instances, the preemption of

The presumption of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27

are other kinds of rights, such as the right -- the

2

entitlement to the creation of agency in someone else's

3

agency instrument.

4

Have I answered --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- and your reasoning,

6

I take it, that Kentucky could adopt a law that says

7

agents lack authority to enter into arbitration on

8

behalf of the principal.

9

MR. SALYER:

Well, technically, Your Honor,

10

that's correct.

11

go that far in this particular case, because again, what

12

we're talking about is interpreting a power of attorney.

13

And if you -- if you take a look at -- let's

14

use a comparison, the -- the spectrum of Volt on one end

15

and DIRECTV on the other end.

16

this Court in Volt said that ordinarily, issues of State

17

contract law interpretation are for the States.

18

accepted the -- the lower California court's

19

interpretation of that -- that particular California

20

contract, even though it -- it meant that there was not

21

going to be an arbitration.

22

DIRECTV, the opposite occurred.

23

However, this Court would not have to

We have instances where

And it

On the other hand, in

And now what's really the difference there?

24

The difference there is where the decision maker has

25

effectively abandoned its interpretive role.

Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

DIRECTV, one could certainly say that the California

2

Appellate Court in that case had abandoned its

3

interpretive role and rather imposed its own policy

4

interests and -- and predilections on that -- that

5

contract.

6

To use another example -- now, this is

7

slightly different because it would fall under the

8

10(b)4 deference standards -- but the difference between

9

Stolt-Nielson on the one hand and Oxford Health on the

10

other.

11

imposed a policy decision on its quote-unquote

12

"interpretation of the contract," and in which case the

13

arbitrator had gone outside of his express powers under

14

that contract, and Oxford Health, where, even though

15

there was some suspicion that the arbitrator had gotten

16

his or her interpretation of the agreement wrong,

17

nonetheless, that arbitrator was attempting to interpret

18

that arbitration contract, and this Court respected

19

that.

You have an instance where an arbitrator simply

20

Now, again, I understand that that was under

21

the 10(b)4 analysis.

22

Clark refers to all contracts.

23

Mr. Pincus, is probably relying on a literal

24

interpretation, well, all contracts means -- means all

25

contracts.

But if you look in this case,
And I think my friend,

But we must recall that in Volt v. Leland

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

Stanford, what we had was also a potential literal

2

interpretation, the Law of the place.

3

place, in that instance, the place being California,

4

well, what is the literal law of that place?

5

law -- the law of that place is the law of the State of

6

California and Federal law.

7

The law of the

That

But the California court had determined that

8

the local understanding of the local usage of that

9

phrase -- phrase, "law of the place," actually just

10
11

referred to California State law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I talk about --

12

focus a little bit on -- on Wellner.

13

response to Mr. Pincus's argument that personal property

14

does include arbitration because choses in action are

15

personal property?

16

MR. SALYER:

What is your

Well, the -- my response to

17

that, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the

18

Kentucky Supreme Court certainly engaged in trying to

19

understand the intentions of the words that the

20

principals meant.

21

principal -- no principal who grants the power to their

22

son, their daughter, their -- their spouse, their --

23

their attorney-in-fact to buy and sell property or

24

engage in contracts involving property would ever think

25

about -- would allow that -- that attorney-in-fact to

And it simply said that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

engage -- engage in one of these arbitration agreements.

2

In that -- in the earlier case regarding

3

powers of attorney in Kentucky -- and that was -- I

4

believe it's U.S. Guarantee & Trust.

5

case, from -- from 1912.

6

effect of giving the power for an agent to buy or sell

7

property does not intrinsically give that person the --

8

the power to mortgage property, although one could say

9

that that should naturally flow from -- from the -- the

It's an older

The -- there's language to the

10

overarching language.

11

backdrop and context in which the Kentucky Supreme Court

12

is operating.

13

So that's the -- the sort of

If I could turn for a second to DIRECTV,

14

which is a -- obviously relied upon, to a large extent,

15

by Kindred.

16

Court reiterated its basic assumption that ordinarily,

17

what a State instrument means is a question for State

18

law in the State courts.

19

circumstances will this Court engage in a preemption,

20

and in essence, an independent review and

21

reinterpretation of that State instrument.

22

In that particular case, I think that this

And only in exceptional

And in DIRECTV, the two similar points that

23

seem to -- to stand out are that that California

24

Appellate Court singled out arbitration, singled out the

25

Federal Arbitration Act for not incorporating Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

Arbitration Act preemption into the way they read their

2

California contract, the DIRECTV contract.

3

so without attempting to tie that effectively to what

4

the parties might intend in the DIRECTV contract.

5

Here, we do not have that.

And they did

We have the

6

Kentucky Supreme Court announcing an interpretive rule

7

that -- and it may be difficult for them to -- to work

8

it out over -- over time, but again, that's the way the

9

common law develops, that if you have a general waiver

10

of a fundamental constitutional right by a power of

11

attorney, that has to be spelled out in the document.

JUSTICE BREYER:

We give the power of

MR. SALYER:

Well, it doesn't make a

difference --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any case that

5

suggests that -- except this case, which happens to deal

6

with arbitration.

7

MR. SALYER:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Well, it does have to -You see, I don't know how

to -- the part I don't know how to deal with your

10

argument is, is you say every time I think of examples

11

that would be very weird, which is what I'm trying to

12

do, then -- then you say, oh, well, yeah, that's right.

13

You can't do that anymore in Kentucky.

14

you say that, the law of Kentucky in terms of attorneys,

15

powers of attorney is getting more and more peculiar.

16

That's why I suspect something is going to happen there.

And every time

17

So what should I -- what do you think?

18

MR. SALYER:

19

Well, Your Honor, I think that

the interpretive rule is -- is rather explicit.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now we say that you

21

cannot enter into a power of attorney giving the power

22

of attorney the power to enter into normal patent

23

settlements.

24

MR. SALYER:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

To -Well, what about business

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33

settlements?

2

know, there is a perfectly normal thing where a person

3

agrees not to compete, and in agreeing not to compete,

4

you're agreeing not to go to certain places?

What about business settlements where, you

MR. SALYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -For that business anyway, a

lot of constitutional rights that might infringe.

8

might if you didn't waive it.

MR. SALYER:

Now -JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you say about the

17

MR. SALYER:

Right.

That would, in fact, be

18

a infringement on the principal's free speech.

19

in instances where there are settlements in personal

20

injury actions, often there are non-disparagement

21

clauses.

22

Right, right.

Indeed,

way, he makes a product, you know, the person who's

4

is there any State that makes that kind of power of

5

attorney illegal or requires it to be explicit somehow

6

that you could settle an ordinary OSHA case, you could

7

settle an ordinary competition case, you could settle an

8

ordinary, you know, patent case on fairly ordinary

9

terms, and it says when you give a power of attorney to

That kind of power
I mean,

10

do that, you have to be explicit?

11

other than Kentucky in this opinion that has ever held

12

such a thing?

13

Is there any State

Maybe there is.

MR. SALYER:

Well, Your Honor, if I could

14

use a -- a comparative example from the -- the UCC, we

15

know that in ongoing transactions between commercial

16

parties under the UCC, whether a -- a contract clause is

17

incorporated into the contract, if and when it is

18

incorporated, may turn on whether or not that clause is

19

considered material.

20

Now, whether or not it's -- it's considered

21

material is a question of State law.

22

understand, they -- that has never been challenged at --

23

that -- some instances, that would -- that will, in

24

fact, cause arbitration clauses not to be incorporated

25

in contracts and not be enforceable because they're

Alderson Reporting Company

And as -- as I

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

considered material and they haven't been negotiated

2

properly.

3

What -- what constitutes a fundamental

4

constitutional right is, of course, an -- an open

5

question, but it does seem that certain things such as

6

speech, marriage, religious rights, those sorts of

7

things cannot be dealt with on a permanent basis

8

vis-à-vis another party by an agent without the

9

principal explicitly authorizing them to do so.

10

Furthermore, what the principal has

11

explicitly authorized the agent to do so is an

12

interpretive question regarding this -- this instrument.

13

And just as a -- with a State statute, what a State

14

statute means is a question for the State supreme court.

15

What the principals meant was encompassed within these

16

powers of attorney.

17

determine what that is.

18

should be the State's supreme court.

19

Ultimately, someone has to
And I posit that that -- that

If you make the

have this explicit reference than other contracts,

2

doesn't that discriminate against arbitration

3

agreements?

4

MR. SALYER:

Perhaps it does, Your Honor.

5

But, again, our -- our position is that the Federal

6

Arbitration Act does not extend beyond agreements to

7

arbitrate, such that in the -- the instance of the --

8

the UCC example that I just used where a State decision

9

as to whether or not arbitration clauses are considered

10

material might make that -- might make it harder to form

11

the arbitration agreement as part of the larger

12

commercial contract.

13

Arbitration does not speak to that.

14

We believe that the Federal

However, there are, on the other hand,

15

instances where if a State specifically singles out

16

arbitration to make it more difficult to form, we

17

believe that the formation -- that the FAA would have

18

something to say along those lines.

19

example I would like to use in that instance is the

20

facts of Casarotto, if -- if they were slightly

21

different.

22

And the -- the

If the Montana statute hadn't used the

23

language in its subsection that unless the arbitration

24

clause is in -- you know, on the first page in bold

25

letters, then that particular clause is unenforceable.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

If they -- if that statute had simply said, we do not

2

recognize the formation of an agreement to arbitrate

3

unless these hoops are -- are jumped through, that, we

4

believe, would be addressed by the Federal Arbitration

5

Act because it's not really a formation issue.

6

really an enforceability issue, relieving the parties to

7

the contract in Casarotto of the responsibility for what

8

they voluntarily signed in which there was a clear

9

meaning.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's

Well, you say you're

11

distinguishing formation from enforcement, but we have

two separate agreements that both been formed the power

of attorney that's been concluded, the agent has signed

16

they mean, what is the proper interpretation of the

17

power of attorney.

18

MR. SALYER:

So it's not a question of

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That --

19

that's correct inasmuch as -- the question here revolves

around what the power of attorney means.

21

of attorney encompassed the authority for the agent to

22

sign this agreement, then, as the Kentucky Supreme Court

23

said, the agreement will be enforced.

24

then there's no agreement.

25

that the Federal Arbitration Act does not bear upon

If the power

If it doesn't,

And I'm saying -- saying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

answering that question; that that is a function of

2

State law and of the State court's interpretation of a

3

power of attorney instrument.

4

So in summation, our -- our general --

5

our -- our general position is that the Federal

6

Arbitration Act again does not extend this Court's

7

interpretive powers beyond agreements to arbitrate.

8

does not extend them to powers of attorney.

9

this Court need not even reach out to that particular

10

principle because we are talking about interpreting a

11

power of attorney, which, in the ordinary course of a

12

State instrument, is up to the State supreme court to --

13

to -- to make that interpretation.

14

only step in and substitute its interpretation for that

15

of the State supreme court in the exceptional

16

circumstances.

It

However,

And this Court will

17

And the only exceptional circumstances that

18

this Court has identified in DIRECTV do not apply here.

19

The Kentucky Supreme Court did not single out

20

arbitration for distinctive treatment, and the Kentucky

21

Supreme Court went out of its way to tie the -- its

22

interpretation of the meaning and authority of the power

23

of attorney to the intention of the principal.

24

No further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4
5

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a couple of quick points.

6

With respect to the -- the question about

7

whether the FAA is limited to arbitration agreements, I

8

think it's important to note that the text of the FAA

9

says that arbitration agreements shall be valid

10

irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as

11

exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any

12

contract.

13

So it's true the focus of the FAA is on

14

whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable or not,

15

but there's nothing in the FAA that prohibits its

16

application to an antecedent agreement if that

17

antecedent agreement prohibits the enforcement of the

18

arbitration agreement on a ground that's specific to

19

arbitration.

20

And I think that's not only true of the text

21

of the statutes; it's true because the implications of

22

that rule would be quite dramatic.

23

could just enact a statute that says a power of attorney

24

can never be interpreted to confer the ability to enter

25

into an arbitration agreement either at all, which my

Alderson Reporting Company

For example, a State

Official - Subject to Final Review

40
1

friend, I think, acknowledged would -- would be

2

problematic under the FAA or could impose all kinds of

3

special requirements.

4

have to be warnings about the dangers of arbitration.

5

And surely --

6
7

It has to be notarized.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There

Now, the State could

also --

8

MR. PINCUS:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- that would -The State could also

10

enact a statute that says powers of attorney can't

11

waive -- can't waive fundamental rights.

12

that violate the FAA, in your view?

13

MR. PINCUS:

Would -- would

I -- I think it would present a

14

more difficult question than this case.

15

explain why and then let me answer your -- your

16

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

And let me

I think as -- as some of Justice Breyer's

18

questions indicated, the rule here doesn't, in fact,

19

embody that principle because it is both -- it -- it is

20

underinclusive in two respects.

21

all jury waivers because --

22

It doesn't even affect

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

But I mean,

23

legislators -- legislatures often pass statutes that are

24

underinclusive or overinclusive.

25

distinguishes the case.

So I don't think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think the question

2

would be just how inclusive is it.

3

interpreted -- if it is the same kind of --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -- if it's

It -- it says it

5

embodies the rule that the supreme -- Kentucky Supreme

6

Court adopted, which is that you can't -- you can't

7

waive fundamental rights, and like a lot of statutes,

8

it's going to require some interpretation.

9

all it says.

But that's

It says, you can't -- you know, they're

10

worried about the scope of powers of attorney, and they

11

say powers of attorney in Kentucky cannot waive

12

fundamental rights under the Constitution.

13

MR. PINCUS:

And -- and I -- I -- I think

14

our answer to that question would be -- although the

15

Court doesn't have to reach it here -- that lumping

16

arbitration agreements into that category of fundamental

17

rights is a judgment that the FAA precludes the State

18

from making because the judgment --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that -- that suggests

20

that the arbitration is a preferred right, and I thought

21

that the idea of the FAA was to say it can't be --

22

whatever, dis-preferred, un-preferred, you know -- but

23

not to put it on its own separate plane, like you can't

24

deal with this in the same way that you could deal with

25

any other fundamental right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

MR. PINCUS:

Well, that's why I say it would

2

be a harder question, Your Honor, but -- but I think

3

the -- the critical thing is here, it's quite clear from

4

the State court's own opinion that that isn't the rule

5

of decision here because the State court, as the dissent

6

points out, the -- the express authorization requirement

7

doesn't apply to jury waivers in a host of different

8

circumstances, as Justice Breyer's opinions pointed out,

9

and it also doesn't apply to lots of fundamental --

10

other kinds of fundamental rights.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But how do we really know?

12

Are -- are you saying that a court can never announce a

13

generally applicable rule first in an arbitration case?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think it -- it

15

certainly is something that should raise a lot of

16

suspicion.

17

never, but I do think that this aspect of the case

18

presents a -- a more compelling argument for application

19

of the FAA than Imburgia.

20

Can it never -- I would never want to say

In Imburgia, the threshold question for the

21

court was, does the California State courts'

22

interpretation of the phrase "law of your State"

23

actually discriminate against -- single out arbitration?

24

There's no doubt that this rule is singling out

25

arbitration.

If that's what the court --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2

MR. PINCUS:

3

Suppose -- well, suppose --

-- expressly says, the question

is how broad is it singling out.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't single

5

out arbitration.

6

it.

7

down to is you just don't believe the Kentucky Supreme

8

Court when it says this is the general principle.

9

you're saying, well, I really think you're hostile to

That happens to be the issue before

I mean, basically, it seems to me what it's coming

And

10

arbitration because I haven't heard that principle

11

before and this is the first one.

12

if the Kentucky legislature passes a law that does the

13

same thing, I mean, are you going to be suspicious of

14

them too just because arbitration might be the first

15

time it comes up?

16

MR. PINCUS:

But you know, if --

I -- I think it -- it depends

17

on the circumstances and it depends on -- on how

18

badly --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose -- suppose we send

20

this back and we say we don't really believe you.

21

think you're being hostile to arbitration, and they say,

22

well, prove it.

23

24

that they don't really have any intention of doing, but

25

they really do it.

They say, and arbitration too.

5

What do we do then?

6

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I -- I guess a couple of

7

things.

8

make a judgment, as it did in Imburgia, based on what's

9

before it at the time.

First of all, I -- I do think the Court has to

And what's before the Court at

10

this time is a rule created in the context of

11

arbitration --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. PINCUS:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I know, but I want --

-- premised on --- what I want to hear you

15

talk about, usually we don't presume that State courts

16

are acting in ways that are not in accordance with law.

17

Actually, we usually give them the benefit of a kind of

18

good faith presumption.

19

So if you're saying, well, no, they have to

20

prove it first in five other cases before we'll believe

21

them that they really do mean all constitutional rights,

22

that seems, you know, an unusual rule to apply to State

23

supreme courts who we usually think are acting in good

24

faith and in accordance with law.

25

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I don't -- I don't know

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

that they have to prove it.

2

look at the objective indicia, as it did in Imburgia, as

3

it's done in other cases, to see what -- what is really

4

going on in a case.

5

did not -- although it said all fundamental rights, the

6

five instances that it identified were not general,

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MR. PINCUS:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you --

-- onerous -- I'm sorry.
You have to look at

12

what's going on in the case.

13

just have a statute, there's nothing else to look at.

14

So how -- how -- I still don't get why that would be

15

invalid.

16

MR. PINCUS:

So in my case where you

I -- I think the question in

17

that case would not be whether it's going to be applied

18

to the category of fundamental rights.

19

that case would be does the FAA permit a State to make a

20

judgment that contracts with respect to arbitration

21

should be lumped in --

22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
about arbitration.

The question in

There's no talk

The word "arbitration" --

MR. PINCUS:

-- but -- but there still is a

2

question, I think.

3

FAA said to -- was reacting to was State courts saying

4

arbitration is especially onerous and troublesome and

5

we're going to require -- we're going to require special

6

processes if we --

7

What the FAA -- at bottom, what the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We understand that.

8

But I'm talking about a legislative proposition.

9

doesn't say anything about arbitration.

10

powers of attorney.

11

unless it's expressly stated.

12
13
14

It just says

You can't waive fundamental rights

MR. PINCUS:
harder case.

And it

I -- I think it would be a much

I don't know -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know, but

15

the problem is -- is that it is, in terms of the

16

law-making authority, Kentucky would say to the supreme

17

court, you know, we make these rules through the courts

18

as we did in this case.

19

don't see -- I -- I don't think you've -- well, you

20

haven't come up with a distinction that persuades me,

21

and that's important because I think, as Justice Kagan

22

said, we have to assume the Kentucky Supreme Court is

23

acting in good faith.

24
25

And I just -- I guess I just

JUSTICE BREYER:

your answer is there's nothing wrong with that statute?

MR. PINCUS:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I think -- I think -And that, in fact, what the

3

statutes does, whether it covers arbitration or not, if

4

a court holds that it does cover arbitration, you have

5

to look to see whether the other things in there are

6

like arbitration sufficiently or there are other things

7

that aren't covered that are like arbitration

8

sufficiently, so that you could, at the end, draw a

9

conclusion that this is or is not discriminatory.

10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
in there.

There's nothing else

The -- the first time --

12

MR. PINCUS:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's exactly -The first time the

14

statute is applied, it happens to be to an arbitration

MR. PINCUS:

You can't -Well, I -- I -- I guess two

19

answers.

20

I don't think that's the rule that's being applied.

21

think it's clear, because the instances of fundamental

22

rights that were identified were one part --

23

Just to return to this case for a minute, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I

Mr. Pincus, you

24

understand that when your first answer is, let's go to

25

this case, that's not the most compelling response.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

MR. PINCUS:

I understand, Your Honor,

2

but -- but I -- I -- and to answer the question more

3

broadly, I -- I do think there's a -- there's a question

4

that the Court would have to answer in that

5

circumstance, whether, as Justice Breyer put it more

6

eloquently than I did, that the -- that arbitration is

7

being included in that category not because of some

8

special characteristic of arbitration, but because

9

arbitration agreements have the same characteristics as

10
11

all of those other things -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

Well,

12

how would you do that?

13

maybe Justice Breyer are taking.

14

would you go about that?

15

decide why arbitration is being included in this?

16

That's the position that you and

MR. PINCUS:

How would you -- how

How would you say we've got to

Well, and -- I would say, as an

17

advocate at least, that the problem with that judgment

18

is that what Congress said in the FAA is, in fact, you

19

can't say that arbitration agreements should be treated

20

like some special category of contracts just because of

21

a characteristic of arbitration.

22

another reason.

23

saying arbitration is especially significant because of

24

a -- of a characteristic.

25

is intrinsic to arbitration, and I think that conflicts

There has to be

And what the State is doing there is

It waives the jury right that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

with the Federal policy.

2

So, yes, the State could say that with all

3

fundamental rights.

4

that with respect to arbitration and -- and I might

5

lose.

6

My argument would be it can't do

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- so the -- as I -- as

7

I understand the question better, one, of course the

8

legislature could enact such a statute.

9

Two, if we have our first case arbitration

10

and they say arbitration is included among it, then what

11

we're job is is to read the opinion.

12

Now, sometimes courts don't write enough in

13

the opinion for us to make the decision as to whether or

14

not it is being discriminated against, in which case we

15

send it back and ask them to write more.

16

what we should do?
