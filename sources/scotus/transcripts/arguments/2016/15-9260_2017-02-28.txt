Mr. Stoler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. STOLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The question confronting this Court is

11

whether a judge can exercise discretion at sentencing in

12

light of congressional directives in Section 924(c) that

13

a 30-year mandatory minimum must be imposed as part of

14

the total sentence.

15

Throughout the Sentencing Reform Act, in the

16

myriad of factors set forth for a judge to consider at

17

arriving at an aggregate sentence that meets the

18

overarching goals of being sufficient, but not greater

19

than necessary.

20

the language of Section 924(c) that prevents the judge

21

from reducing the portion of the sentence for crimes of

22

violence.

And we submit that there's nothing in

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

We don't have -We don't doubt that

if the -- the mandatory minimums were out of the picture

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and all we had was the underlying offense here, that

2

this sentence would be reversed on appeal, do you?

3
4

MR. STOLER:

I would -- I would submit, yes.

That would -- that would be accurate, Your Honor.

5

But in addition --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said nothing in

7

924(c), but there is a bar on concurrent sentencing.

8

And reading the statute the way you do would shrink the

9

concurrency to the vanishing point if we add only one

10

day to the 924(c) sentence.

11

MR. STOLER:

Well, the concurrent provision

12

requires that it does not -- it runs in addition to the

13

predicate offense.

14

is the same language that we would find, for example, in

15

Section 1028A of the statutes, which has that same

16

language, but it goes farther.

17

language in 1028A, it follows the same roadmap that

18

924(c) has.

19
20

But the concurrent language in there

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you look at the

But it's 20 years later,

right?

21

MR. STOLER:

It's 20 years later, but -- but

22

924(c) has -- has been recalibrated over time starting

23

in 1968.

24

two separate times, Congress has changed provisions

25

in 10 -- excuse me in 924(c) to change the types of

And even after 1028A came into existence in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. STOLER:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just --

-- and things of that nature.
Just assume the 1028 for a

5

moment didn't exist and say you had to argue from this

6

language, and this essentially repeats Justice

7

Ginsburg's point, but this language says, "It shall run

8

consecutively, it shall not run concurrently."

9

version of this statute essentially allows a district

And your

10

court to negate that language.

11

were not there in terms of what the -- the -- the

12

district court can do.

13

MR. STOLER:

It's as if that language

Well, we -- we submit that the

14

district court has to give some sentence for the

15

underlying crimes of violence, and then they --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, "some sentence," you

17

know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can

18

essentially make that -- that disappear.

19

know, it's concurrent plus a day.

20

have been what Congress meant, concurrent plus a day,

21

when it said, "It shall only be consecutive."

22

MR. STOLER:

I mean, you

I mean, that couldn't

Well, Congress, we assume,

23

knows how to write the laws that they write.

24

have the ability to strictly limit -- and they have in

25

924(c) to some extent, as far as it having to be --

Alderson Reporting Company

And they

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you're right.

The

2

Congress did not say you -- it did not say what it said,

3

in fact, in 1028A.

4

the way we try to understand statutes is to say any

5

reading that utterly eviscerates something that Congress

6

clearly did say can't be a good reading.

7

But, you know, sometimes, sometimes

MR. STOLER:

Well, we would submit that the

8

"in addition to" language is making sure that a separate

9

crime is being separately punished, that being the

10

924(c) crimes that carry the mandatory minimums, in this

11

case of 30 years.

12

says consecutive also is -- is meant to say that -- that

13

it can't run with those -- those nine -- those

14

underlying predicate offenses.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the -- the language that -- that

Counsel, during the time

16

the guidelines were mandatory, but afterwards, many,

17

many court of appeals basically told district courts you

18

can't impose a sentence simply because you disagree with

19

the guideline.

20

reasons to ensure a just result, but you can't impose it

21

merely because you don't like the guideline.

22

monitored that pretty well.

23

You can impose it for independent

And they

That's basically what -- this district court

24

didn't say it didn't like the mandatory minimum.

25

said instead that it thought a fair sentence was, and

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

that -- that would have been one day, if it could have

2

done it, given that the rest of the sentence, 30 years,

3

was even further beyond what the judge thought was

4

adequate for punishment, deterrence, and all the other

5

factors under 3553, correct?

6

MR. STOLER:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
So it's not negating

8

Congress's purpose if a district court gives one day;

9

correct?

10

MR. STOLER:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

And one day is a day of

punishment, isn't it?

13
14

I would -- I would say not, no.

MR. STOLER:
Honor.

No question as to that, Your

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. STOLER:

Isn't that your point?

Basically it is that.

And the

17

-- we also have to take into consideration you have the

18

parsimony guideline -- or requirement that pervades the

19

whole Sentencing Reform Act.

20

find it twice in 3553A that the parsimony provisions are

21

what's considered as to the total sentence.

22

We find in it 3551.

We

And when you look at the factors that are

23

set forth within 3553A, within 3551, which talks about

24

the circumstances of the case, in -- in 3661, which says

25

there's no limitation as to what can be considered by a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

court in determining an appropriate sentence.

2

of that parsimony requirement, that ends up in the

3

results that we have.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In light

Is -- is the -- 924(c) is

5

a statute, it's nothing to do with the guidelines, and

6

it does say sentences have to be consecutive.

7

back to the point I opened with.

8

asking for a concurrent sentence.

9

MR. STOLER:

You are, in effect,

Well, just -- just --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. STOLER:

Just adding one day.

Well, as Justice Kagan and I

12

discussed, one day is an additional punishment.

13

I'm

But as was -- as was indicated, that is an

additional sentence.

2

is provided for according to the statutory provisions.

3

924(c) limits as to it having to be a consecutive

sentence, in this case 30 years, but it does not tell as

5

to the underlying crime of violence predicate

6

offenses --

10
11

That is additional punishment that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it seems to me that

you -MR. STOLER:

-- to which is something that

should be decided.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that you

12

have to concede that your position completely negates

13

the -- or can completely negate the effect of 924, but

14

that there are other reasons why Congress probably would

15

have allowed that.

16

into account all of those factors.

17

And I suppose that's 3553 to take

So you're saying, basically, that 3553

18

overrides 924(c), but that -- that -- that's hard to

19

read the statute that way.

20

MR. STOLER:

And I'm not -- I'm not

21

suggesting that it should be read that way.

22

that they're -- they're read together.

23

have restrictions that require the "in addition to"

24

language and it requires it be consecutive.

25

no way -- there's nothing in 924(c) that limits what the

Alderson Reporting Company

I think

But 924(c) does

But there's

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

Court can determine as to the predicate offenses as to

2

those crimes of violence.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that you were -- I

4

thought that your answer to the Chief Justice was

5

perhaps telling, because you said that you thought that

6

were it not for 924(c), this would be an unreasonable

7

sentence under -- under 3551 and 3553.

8

Isn't -- wasn't that your answer?

9

MR. STOLER:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And doesn't that show that

11

Congress, although it generally conferred on district

12

courts the authority under those provisions to determine

13

what is a reasonable sentence in light of the enumerated

14

factors, withdrew that discretion with respect to the

15

component that is covered by 924(c)?

16

So if that's what the -- if that's what

17

Congress was doing, then why shouldn't that entire

18

sentence be ruled out in determining the sentence that

19

is reasonable under the count that is not governed by

20

924(c)?

21

MR. STOLER:

Because we don't read 924(c) as

22

being in conflict with -- with 3553(a); you read all the

23

statutes together.

24

know how to -- how to set constraints and set

25

limitations, and they then did so in 924(c) to ensure

And Congress knows -- I believe they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

that a violent crime such as -- as carrying guns in

2

commission of a predicate offense is going to carry a

3

long period of sentence and a severe sentence.

4

And they wanted to ensure, if you look at

5

the history of 924(c) and its -- and its evolution, its

6

recalibration over time, it has made it -- I mean, when

7

we first started off in 924(c), there could still be

8

a -- there could still be a suspended sentence or

9

parole.

Sentencing Reform Act took those away.

So they

10

recalibrated 924(c) to reflect that, and they've done so

11

over time.

12

And they, again, had the -- the ability

13

after 1028A came into existence to say that you can't

14

consider, you can't compensate for, you can't take into

15

account that -- that, in that case, an aggravated

16

identity theft, but that mandatory minimum sentence when

17

you're making a determination as to that underlying

18

crime of violence.

They could --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. STOLER:

21
22

But what about --

-- have done something; they

didn't.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about Judge

23

Lucero's point that Congress can do a

24

belt-and-suspenders operation, as if -- that there

25

was -- there was additional insurance in 1028, doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

mean that 924(c) shouldn't be read to have a real

2

sentence for the predicate offense?

3

MR. STOLER:

We would answer that the -- the

4

Congress had the opportunity to do so, and they didn't

5

do so, when they amended 924(c) at least two times since

6

the advent of 1028A.

7

because there, they went forward and said this is how --

8

they used all the language in 924(c), and they went

9

farther and then put that additional restriction on the

And it's not a redundancy issue,

10

sentencing court to make a determination as to the

11

underlying predicate offense that you can't consider

12

that mandatory minimum in doing so.

13

Congress has that ability to do so.

They

14

know how to write the laws and they know how to limit

15

sentencing discretion, and they did so to the extent

16

that they did in 924(c).

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you think that's a

18

realistic -- a realistic assessment of the way a

19

legislative body works?

20

924(c).

21

we're amending 924.

22

strengthen 924 to make it in line with 1028.

23
24
25

They -- so we put this in

Then we put stronger language in 1028, and now
And, well, maybe we better

Did they have any reason to think about that
at the time when they amended 924?
MR. STOLER:

We would submit that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

has --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A circuit court's

3

ruling -- there's at least one, the Tenth, that had

4

ruled in your favor.

5

MR. STOLER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Had it done so by the

time 924(c) was amended?

8
9

That's correct.

MR. STOLER:
came down in 2014.

Yes.

The decision in Smith

There's also a Sixth Circuit case,

10

United States v. Franklin, that I believe came down in

11

2007 that -- that postdated the changes in 9 -- in

12

1028 --

13

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Postdated or predated

the changes in 924 -MR. STOLER:

Came out -- came out -- it came

after the changes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'll pick up

Justice Alito's question, then.
Is there any indication that Congress was
aware of those court of appeals decisions?
MR. STOLER:

Well, Congress in the past has

22

made changes to 924(c) based upon what courts have done.

23

If we look at the Busic opinion, for example.

24

courts had interpreted that there was no requirement for

25

the consecutive or additional sentence, and they went

Alderson Reporting Company

They --

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

and they changed 924(c) in -- in response to what this

2

Court had done in Busic.

3

that -- that the Congress has that ability.

4

make changes to 924(c) in the future, obviously, that

5

would be in -- in relationship to what they feel is --

6

is the appropriate punishments that must be imposed for

7

the crimes that have been committed.

8
9

So I submit that the Court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
defendant?

10

How old was your

Do you know?
MR. STOLER:

He was 24 years old.

11

his co-defendant brother was 23 years old.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

If they do

His --

That was --

So he would be 50-odd

something?

14

MR. STOLER:

He would -- he -- under the

15

current sentence, he would serve more time than he's

16

actually lived.

17

And if he had --

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is something that a

18

direct answer to, because the statutes have changed so

19

quickly that I may have lost track.

20

3553(b) is what I'm looking at, and that talks about

21

departures.

22

was a departure.

23

for -- and you did sentence the judge under the

24

guidelines; correct?

25

But the -- but the

And I take it that the sentence for robbery
The -- the guideline recommendation

MR. STOLER:

The judge calculated the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

guidelines, right.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

depart from the guidelines.

4

depart from the guideline sentence, which was 48 months

5

or 44 months.

6

MR. STOLER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. STOLER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

All right.

He didn't

He didn't -- but he did

40 months in this case -Right.

-- Your Honor, yes.
All right.

And he went

from there to one day.

11

And 3553(b) says you have to -- I don't know

12

if it's still law -- have to impose a guideline sentence

13

unless the court finds there exists here a mitigating

14

circumstance of a kind or to a degree not adequately

15

taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in

16

formulating the guideline.

17

So you'd look and see their guideline says

18

48 months, and they departed down to a day for the

19

reason that there was this add-on sentence, the

20

mandatory.

21

Now, is there anything that suggests that

22

the commission did not have that in -- take that into

23

account?

24

departure, viewed not now from what Congress intended,

25

not viewed from the point of view of the statutes you've

In other words, is it a proper factor for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

been referring to, but viewed simply from the view of

2

the commission and the Congress as to when you can

3

depart downward?

4

MR. STOLER:

Your Honor, I would submit that

5

this is not really a guideline analysis in that the

6

judge made a determination --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

This is a statute.

8

And the statute says, Judge, if you want to depart

9

downward, you can do so if you're applying the

10

guidelines only for a reason -- the words are, to repeat

11

them, a mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree

12

not adequately taken into consideration by the

13

sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines.

14

I'm not giving you an answer.

It's not a

15

hostile question; it's not a friendly question.

16

question I'd like to know the answer to.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a

The -- the sentencing

18

judge did depart downward considerably, because the

19

guideline range was --

20

MR. STOLER:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. STOLER:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what was suggested.

24
25

Yes.
-- here, as in --

That's right.
He

departed downward to 40 from -- what was the range?
MR. STOLER:

It was 84 to 105 months without

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

the -- the enhancement that would be under the

2

guidelines if the guns were present.

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

significant -- it was a significant departure.

5
6

MR. STOLER:

And he -- he gave various

reasons for making that departure, that variance --

7
8

So it was a

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the basic reason was he

thought that the mandatory was long enough.

9

MR. STOLER:

Well, he also -- the judge

10

indicated that the -- the reasons he was considering

11

this was the role that he had -- the role that Levon

12

Dean, Jr., had played compared to the role that his

13

brother had played.

14

criminal history and the nature of those convictions

15

that he had.

16

--

17

He determined that based upon his

He articulated numerous reasons as to the

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the basic reason, I

18

think it's fair to say, is he thought the mandatories

19

were long enough.

20
21

MR. STOLER:

If he could -- if he could have

gone to --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let -- let me assume that

23

then.

And it seems to me as if I hadn't thought that

24

through till this moment, and I still haven't, the

25

relation of 50 -- 3553(b).

It may be you haven't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

thought it through either.

2

I mean -- and maybe there isn't one, but -- but I -- I

3

wanted to learn as much as I could if there is a

4

relevance of that.

5

MR. STOLER:

Maybe nobody has, but -- but

Well, and I looked at the --

6

the factors that are set forth under 3553(a), in which

7

the guidelines are one of those factors, the same as

8

policy statements are one of those factors, and they go,

9

I submit, to the overall sentence that the court

10

imposes.

11

guideline sentence that he's -- he's deciding.

12

varying, based upon these 3553(a) factors, those

13

tapestry of factors that the thread of parsimony runs

14

through in which he makes those -- those determinations.

15
16
17
18
19

And when a judge in this case, it's not a
He's

Let's look at -- at what those four main
tenets of -- of parsimony are.
JUSTICE BREYER:

For example, the term --

I -- I know 3553(a).

That

isn't a problem for me.
What I'm trying to think of is maybe this is

20

a matter that lies in the hands of the commission.

21

Maybe you could say, well, the commission didn't say you

22

couldn't depart for that reason and, therefore, it is a

23

factor, a mitigating factor not considered by the

24

commission, but maybe the commission, should it choose

25

to do so, could consider it and could say when it could

couldn't depart downward.

that's what's going through my mind and there's no point

repeating myself.

5

about it, you might not have.

side issue.

7

You see, that -- that's --

You thought -- you might have thought

MR. STOLER:

It's a little bit of a

Well, I -- I -- I'd like to

8

think I've thought about it from the context of -- of

9

looking at the guidelines as a -- as a starting point

10

and as a -- as a determination that helps to -- to guide

11

a court to consider sentencing.

12

for the Court to consider, and the overall factors that

13

are set forth in 3553(a), as well as 3661, as well as

14

3551, leads us to consider all of those factors in

15

determining what total sentence should be imposed in

16

this case.

17

But it's just a factor

The court varied in this instance based upon

18

what he found the guidelines to be, but then there's

19

additional things that he considered, those factors that

20

he looked at to make the determination as to what would

21

be the appropriate sentence to impose on -- on -- on the

22

Petitioner in this case.

23

And any -- any total sentence is obviously

subject to appellate review for substantial -- for

2

instance, felt that the court could then impose a

3

sentence of -- of one day with the additional 30 years,

4

the mandatory minimums required, and the government felt

5

that that was not a substantive -- substantively

6

reasonable sentence, that's still subject to review by

7

the appellate courts.

8

So the government, if in this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- how does that

9

normally work, not in a mandatory minimum way, but if

10

you've got three different offenses and -- and you're

11

going to be sentenced on each of them?

12

review, how is that reviewed?

13

or do they go by one -- one, two, and three and say, we

14

think you abused your discretion in only giving, you

15

know, five months for this and then that doesn't affect

16

the three years you gave for that.

17

actually happen?

18

MR. STOLER:

On appellate

Is it the total sentence

How -- how does that

I -- my understanding is that

19

the -- the -- the appellate review is based upon the

20

reasonableness of the total sentence that's imposed.

21

Now, if there is a portion of that sentence that -- that

22

the court felt that the -- that it wasn't dealt with

23

properly by the sentencing court, then they would

24

address that either for clear error in -- in what was

25

looked at and how the guidelines were applied or de novo

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21

as to the applications of the guidelines themselves.

2

So there are those -- those considerations

3

to be made from appellate review standpoint, but the

4

over -- overriding consideration, I would submit, would

5

be the substantive reasonableness for abuse of

6

discretion.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In first looking at this

8

case, my thought was that it would be very difficult for

9

the judge to determine what the sentence should be for

10

the underlying crime without looking at what he was

11

require -- or he or she was required to do under 924.

12

But then it occurred to me that judges and lawyers do

this all the time.

15

We -- we think of a hypothetical

What sentence

would I give?

19

in an abstract way.

20

the judge from making the -- quite a proper

determination for the underlying offense and said --

22

then saying, but looking at the statute, it has to be

23

consecutive and the consecutive sentence has been -- the

24

length of the consecutive sentence has been set forth.

25

So I -- I see nothing analytically difficult about the

Your Honor, that -- that turns around the determination

7

the -- the consideration overall as to the underlying

8

crimes of violence still lends itself to -- to

9

discretion by the sentencing --

10
11

The independence -- the -- the separate

I mean, it has to be put on to that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, that's -- that's --

that's --

12

MR. STOLER:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

It has

Keep that in mind -That's the question before

us.

15

MR. STOLER:

And I -- and I believe the --

16

the Court in Smith, United States v. Smith, the Tenth

17

Circuit case that we're relying upon, talks about that.

18

You -- you can't have judges having blinders to look at

19

just the underlying crimes of violence and then -- then

20

doing so as the government is suggesting in this case --

21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
1028A.

23
24
25

Well, you couldn't under

MR. STOLER:

But 1028A has the additional

requirement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you said you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

can't have this, but you can if we interpret the statute

2

the way the government wants.

3

MR. STOLER:

My argument is that the -- the

4

Congress could have written the statute to include what

5

they included in 1028A.

6

instance.

7

They didn't do so in this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, in terms of that

8

analytical difficulty, there is inherent in this scheme

9

a bit of double -- a lot of double counting, because the

10

substantive crimes almost always, in trying to judge the

11

severity of punishment for that, you're always thinking

12

of the gun, and -- and that always adds to whatever

13

analytically separate punishment you think should be

14

given for the substantive crime.

15

So there is a little bit of twisting of a

16

judge by saying you have to somehow put yourself in the

17

position of punishing this person without knowing that

18

he's going to be punished for the gun anyway for 30

19

years, and think of what the punishment should be

20

without that punishment.

21

both crimes, correct?

Because the gun is present in

22

MR. STOLER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
The identity theft

25

only two years, correct?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. STOLER:

Correct, the aggravated

identity theft.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in many ways it's

4

punishing for a separate activity than merely the

5

possession of identity theft items.

6

MR. STOLER:

Well, there are -- listed

7

within the statute are the specified crimes that it

8

would apply to, yes.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.

So the five

years is for the terrorism.

MR. STOLER:

Alderson Reporting Company

unreasonable without the 924(c).

would directly circumvent 924(c)'s longstanding

additional and consecutive sentence beyond the

punishment for the predicate solely for the choice to

Accepting his position

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It -- it would

On the other hand, it seems to me that

10

if you're talking about 30 years for an offense that a

11

judge thinks merits a lot less, if Congress wanted to

12

prevent circumvention, they should have written the law

13

a lot more carefully.

14

MR. YANG:

Well, I think it's true that

15

Congress could have written it more clearly, but we

16

think that Congress here, when you take a look at both

17

the provisions of 924(c) and then read them in

18

conjunction with the provisions of the Sentencing Reform

19

Act makes sufficiently clear Congress's intent that --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure -- I'm

21

not sure "sufficiently clear" is enough.

22

"indisputably clear."

I think maybe

24

to be fair, that -- that this is contrary to the thrust

25

of 924(c), and I'm not sure when you're talking about

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

the Court's decision in Abbot also says that the

14

language compels the imposition of an additional -- and

15

I believe this is on 25 of the opinion, this is a

16

unanimous opinion of the Court.

17

And I think the Court recognized that when

18

you look at 924(c), it -- particularly when you look at

19

the drafting history, from 1971 onward where Congress

20

was taking step after step after step to restrict the

21

sentencing instructions --

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is not taken into account by the commission, unless

Alderson Reporting Company

you can tell me there's a guideline on this particular

application of the mandatory minimum.

So unless you can point to me someplace

where they take this into consideration, although they

into consideration at all.

MR. YANG:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I think the -And therefore the language

allows it.

13

theory allows it, because the theory is you could have a

14

person there who's convicted of 19 multiple counts, you

know, and -- and the judge is given considerable power

16

to work all this out so that you have overall a fair

sentence.

The language allows it, and indeed the

All right?

That's the whole argument.

18

So what's your response?

Well, I guess to the whole

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. YANG:

I know you do.

But -- but I think -- first of

all, on the -- on the guidelines point, the guidelines

when you were on the Sentencing Commission.

Where?

Well -Where did you take this?

Where.
MR. YANG:

Well, the guidelines specifically

6

address in Section 2K2.4, comment note 4, they talk

7

about how you -- and as well as in Chapter 5 about

8

determining a total sentence based on aggregate

9

sentences, multiple terms of imprisonment.

The

10

guidelines said that what you do with the predicate is

11

you determine the predicate under the guidelines, but

12

you don't include the specific offense --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. YANG:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's --

-- characteristic of -That's -I'm -- I'm going to

17

let you get back to a fuller answer to Justice Breyer.

18

But that certainly cuts against you, the idea that they

19

recognize that, yes, you do have to look to the

20

mandatory minimums.

21

in imposing the sentence.

22

down to what the actual sentence is, you can't look at

23

the mandatory minimums at all.

24
25

You should take that into account

MR. YANG:

And now you say when it gets

I don't think it cuts against us,

as in -- in we're going to have multiple discussions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29

about these various factors.

2

First, I don't think the guidelines shed a

3

lot of light on the statutory question here.

4

were to disagree with our understanding of the

5

guidelines, that would not mean that the statute's

6

wrong; it means that the guidelines would have to give

7

way.

8

which, again, have existed since the very beginning.

We are defending the commentary in the guidelines,

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:
it.

If you

You look at 2.4.

I missed

Where -- where is the place on --

11

MR. YANG:

2K2.4, comment note 4.

And --

12

and then subsequently, this is also cited in our brief

13

back in the pages around the 40s when we discussed the

14

guidelines.

15

But about the guidelines in the statute, the

16

guidelines would have to give way.

17

the commentary because we think, not only have this

18

commentary been around since 1987 when the guidelines

19

were first sent to Congress, and had since been there,

20

we think this is a sensible distinction between the

21

conduct that the court considers when determining the

22

sentencing of the predicate, and knowing that the

23

conduct is accounted for separately in the 924(c), and

24

considering the total aggregate sentence.

25

something different.

Alderson Reporting Company

And we are defending

That is

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

Congress specified where courts look to the

2

total aggregate sentence in Section 3584.

3

3584, Congress said, "When there are multiple terms of

4

imprisonment, the court shall, with respect to each

5

offense, consider the 3554 -- 3553A factors when

6

deciding whether to make the total sentence by making

7

them concurrent or consecutive."

8
9

In Section

But we know that Section 924(c) wholly
removed that power.

And in doing so, it removed the

10

power of the court to tailor the total aggregate

11

sentence, which is a power that was set to --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the government must

13

recognize that 924(c) can influence the sentence on the

14

predicate offense because -- I think I'm correct in

15

saying the government takes the position if 924(c) drops

16

out if it's not proved, then when it goes back to the

17

district court --

18

MR. YANG:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

Right.
-- the district court can

enlarge the original sentence for the predicate offense.

21

MR. YANG:

And because we think -- and this

22

is what happens in -- in courts, courts are applying the

23

guidelines.

24

calculating the sentence for the predicate, you ignore

25

the offense conduct with respect to the gun because we

consider the offense conduct as it considers the -- the

-- the sentence for the predicate.

This is a --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if you drop the

Where?

Where?

I mean,

7

I -- my quick reading of 4, I promise I didn't memorize

8

the guidelines.

9

don't know them perfectly, by any means, and never did.

I used to know them pretty well, but I

10

But it seems to me that comment 4 in 2K2.4

11

is saying that -- that defendant, you have committed a

12

crime, and in our guideline as punishment for the crime,

13

part of it is increased because you had a gun.

14

if we're going to apply the mandatory over here, which

15

is our special statute here, don't apply that.

16

don't see anything there that says you can't subtract.

17

MR. YANG:

And so

But I

Well, when you go to 5G1.2, which

18

governs the total sentence, the -- when you have

19

multiple offenses with terms of imprisonment, it says

20

you -- you calculate the total sentence with respect to

21

this is the way that the guidelines have been applied,

case.

was the proper guideline sentence in district court.

13

And then the district court then varied downward, and I

14

think the provision that you're talking about, about

unfair?

We're not relying on the

20

guidelines as an affirmative.

21

out in our brief we think the guidelines are consistent.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We just wanted to point

But what are you suggesting

23

ought to happen?

24

reflect an idea that there shouldn't be any

25

double-counting of the gun, right?

I mean, presumably, the guidelines

Alderson Reporting Company

So what does -- how

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying

2

crime, taking away the fact of the gun?

3

In other words, most robberies have guns in

4

them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they

5

have guns in them, don't they?

6

MR. YANG:

Aren't they?

No, actually.

The guidelines

7

take into account things like Hobbs Act robbery and

8

separately account for the gun with a two-level

9

enhancement.

And so the guidelines range, when you

10

commit a Hobbs Act robbery without a gun, will just be

11

the standard Hobbs Act robbery range.

12

Now, there are going to be other offense

13

characteristics if you injure someone or -- you know,

14

these things can affect --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What you think ought to

16

happen is that the -- is that the judge should say,

17

okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a

18

reasonable sentence for that.

19

MR. YANG:

I think the judge should do --

20

take into account what judges normally do under a real

21

offense sentencing approach, which is you look at the

22

offense conduct, you look at the history and

23

characteristics of the defender --

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, offense conduct, does

that mean without a gun?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

MR. YANG:

But -- but without the gun.

We

2

say -- we think the judge has discretion, ultimately, to

3

either consider it with the gun or -- or not because

4

Congress hasn't expressly prohibited that.

5

guidelines approach, which we think is permissible, is

6

to consider it; you consider it without the gun and then

7

you -- the reason for that is the guidelines say

8

Congress has separately provided -- remember, the

9

legislative history, I think, there are -- Senator

But the

10

Mansfield, that kind of was the -- the main proponent of

11

the relevant text, the very stringent sentencing

12

provisions, made clear that the whole purpose of this

13

was to impose this additional sentence and require

14

additional time in prison solely for the choice to use

15

the gun, so the guidelines --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that -- that's an

17

excerpt from the legislative history that, it seems to

18

me, is unimportant in light of what 3553 says.

19

says, you know, well, that the judge at the end of the

20

day has to consider the need for the sentence imposed to

21

reflect the serious of the offense and so forth. And --

because you said, no, you're not saying that 924

supersedes 3553.

14

You might still be right, but you have to be saying that

15

there's this background principle, which is 3553, which

16

is this parsimony principle and all these factors, and

17

then 924 comes along and says, but not here.

18

I think you have to be saying that.

MR. YANG:

I guess in a sense we are saying

that, but I don't think it -- it operates directly on

this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said,

We think that it's clear enough

because 3553(a) applies by -- when you -- for purposes

require specificity, because the guidelines are

gyrations that we go through as judges to comply with

I'm

Well, we --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, if we had the

have -- the commission could look into this and it could

left with the provision that says that a -- a court of

So now we're

Is that the right word?

it -- there's a word in the appellate part when they're

MR. YANG:

the -- the question in this case beyond the case is

really, how do we do that?

don't think it's clear.

MR. YANG:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

Well, I think -And now -- now, what about

other things.

around in your mind.

4

Now you tell me.

Those are floating

I'd like to know what's floating

MR. YANG:

I -- I don't believe the

5

commission gets any deference with respect to construing

6

Federal statutes.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. YANG:

9

Well, I --

With respect to the guidelines,

yes, but with respect to construing Federal statutes,

10

I -- I don't think so.

11

924(c) and its interaction to the various provisions of

12

the Sentencing Reform Act.

And so what we're back to is

13

The -- the key provisions, they rely on

14

3553(a) and they say look, you have to consider all

15

these factors, but 3553(a) applies in very specific

16

places of the Sentencing Reform Act, including when

17

there are multiple terms of imprisonment and a court has

18

to decide what the total imprisonment is going to be.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MR. YANG:

Counsel --

That's 3584, and that's been

21

taken away because Congress took away the power to -- to

22

have concurrent sentences.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you think the

24

case is resolved at a higher level, it seems to me that

25

your -- your friend has a very good technical argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

that says these sentences have to run concurrently.

2

day, they run concurrently, end of case.

3

One

And your argument is, you know, you look at

4

the drafting history, the commentary to 2K2.4, all the

5

other arguments you got and you make -- make -- and the

6

basic one is well, that's technically correct, but it's

7

obviously not what Congress had in mind.

8

obviously had in mind adding the mandatory onto a normal

9

sentence, one way or another, under -- under the

Congress

10

guidelines in 30 and all the provisions we've been

11

talking about.

12

So if you view the case that way,

13

technically correct, you know, contrary to the obvious

14

policy, what -- what case can you give me that tells us

15

how to approach a conflict like that?

16

MR. YANG:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, our -What's your --

18

what's your best case when you have a very significant

19

sanction in the balance, and you have technical

20

compliance on one hand, but clearly contrary to purpose?

21
22

MR. YANG:

they're technically correct.

23
24
25

We don't think that the -- that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understand

that.
MR. YANG:

We -- we think that there is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

plausible argument that they make on the text, but we

2

think that the proper approach is you always have to

3

approach statutes holistically.

4

statutory text; you look at the Congress's text

5

structure, the context --

6

You look at the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but then there

7

are also these basic rules they -- I mean, you insist

8

when citizens deal with the government that they turn

9

square corners, and I think it's right for a criminal

10

defendant when they're facing 30 additional years to

11

insist that the government turn square corners.

12

MR. YANG:

Well, I think what you might be

13

referring to is the principle of lenity.

14

has repeatedly emphasized -- I think Abramski; one of

15

Justice Kagan's recent opinions explains this -- that

16

lenity applies only if there's a grievous ambiguity that

17

you might -- at the end of the day you --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the Court

But I don't think you have

19

to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be

20

right.

21

along the lines of what the Chief Justice was saying.

22

You would just say something like, look, if we're going

23

to be strictly textualist here, this does not have the

24

kind of requirement you wish it had, which is to say it

25

doesn't have the language that's in 1028A.

I mean, you were just saying this is very much

Alderson Reporting Company

Your

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

essential argument is that, read Mr. Stoler's way, this

2

would utterly eviscerate (c)(1)(D)(ii), the consecutive

3

requirement.

4

there's still this question of when a statute doesn't

5

say what you would like it to say and you're reduced to

6

saying if you read it the other guy's way, it would

7

eviscerate what we -- what we meant when we passed

8

another provision, you know, what -- what should we do

9

and where do you point us?

10

And I'm quite sympathetic to that.

MR. YANG:

But

I would say that it's true that

11

it -- it eviscerates the purpose and the whole structure

12

of the statute, but the statute says a lot by removing

13

authority.

14

removed.

15

of the government's appendix, 3584.

16

discretionary decision of a judge when there are

17

multiple terms of imprisonment, how do you decide the

18

total length.

19

concurrent or consecutive, and 3554(b) -- or 3584(b),

20

sorry, specifically says that in deciding the total

21

length by making consecutive or concurrent, you apply

22

the factors set forth in 3553(a).

23

on.

24
25

So the question is what authority was
I -- I think it's helpful to look at page 11A
3584(b) governs the

The total length is set by making them

That's what they rely

But 924(c) removes that authority.

924(c)

removes the authority to be able to set the total length

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

this case, the judge says I can't look at 3553(a)?

5
6

So you're saying that in

MR. YANG:

No, he does.

The -- the judge --

there are various other places, but for the total --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

than for the initial downward departure.

9

MR. YANG:

But -- but -- but other

But -- but -- but for the total.

10

You -- for -- you can look at 3553(a) in setting the

11

individual terms, but Congress separately addressed how

12

you make those terms, how you add them, make them -- the

13

total, it depends on the aggregate; right?

14

whether you add them or run them concurrently or with

15

each other.

16

addresses, and that's where the 3553(a) factors are

17

applied, but Congress took that authority away.

18

You --

So that is what 3554(b) -- or 3584(b)

That's -- that's what I think speaks

19

volumes.

20

the Sentencing Reform Act, the -- the Sentencing Reform

Act kind of has a modified real offense sentencing

approach.

25

And -- and when you look at the structure of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the judge to say, in calculating the sentence for the

4

underlying offense, I'm going to look at all these

5

factors.

6

going to do in the 924(c), but I'll do something

7

meaningless.

8
9

Frankly, it's meaningless, because what I'm

MR. YANG:

No, no, no, not at all.

If --

if, for instance, a judge would say, as in this case, an

10

appropriate sentence is 40 months, right?

11

says an appropriate sentence for this -- each of these

12

four has a 40-month term.

13

was also a five-year sentence, the judge would then go

14

to 3584(b) and say I'm going to consider the 3553

15

factors to decide if I'm going to add the 40 to the five

16

years, or I'm going to just run them concurrently so

17

it's five years total.

18

The judge

In a normal world, if there

That's what normally happens.

Section 924(c) says you can't do that.

You

19

have to add it.

20

punishment, the punishment for the predicate offense.

21

And so we think that simply underscores what -- what has

22

always been the -- the thrust, the understanding of --

23

of 924(c).

24
25

It is add -- in addition to the

It is a harsh provision.

There is no doubt.

But Congress intended that to be harsh because of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

extreme danger presented when you add a gun to either a

2

crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense.

3

Congress made that determination that it's going to be

4

at least five additional years for the gun, and if

5

there's a second or subsequent, 25 years.

6

with that length of an imprisonment simply circumvents

7

what Congress was doing in 924(c).

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

Disagreement

If -- if you -- if you're

in the realm of what's reasonable and the judge is

10

looking at, well, you are under the appellate provision

11

because he's varied from the guidelines, of course, you

12

have to give the mandatory minimum, there it is, the

13

gun, 25 years.

14

is way beyond what this guy did.

15

but his total conduct here was -- doesn't warrant such a

16

long sentence.

And now the judge thinks, you know, this

17

MR. YANG:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's fine for the gun,

On appellate -It's in -- it's in the

19

-- analysis.
If think that, then you

win; that's the end of it.

6

MR. YANG:

And -- and that's why, you know,

7

when you have a predicate offense that Congress said add

8

this additional mandatory on, you don't look to the

9

length of the total, because maybe -- maybe 30 years, in

10

the judge's view, is not reasonable, but Congress

11

required that.

12

That is a separate -- that is for Congress

13

to decide what the minimum is going to be for the

14

924(c).

15

look at the predicate offense and you say would this be

16

a reasonable -- one day for four felonies, would that be

17

reasonable?

18

as -- as my brother conceded at -- in his argument.

19

What would be reasonable is when you take a

And the answer to that is of course not,

So, again, I think the whole -- the idea

20

that a judge would go down to one day because of a

disagreement with the length of the mandatory minimum

simply circumvents the statute and is inconsistent with

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. STOLER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. STOLER:

There's no affirmative ban in

5

district courts considering 924(c) sentencing when

6

considering the predicate offenses, and given the

7

overarching theme of -- of discretion and parsimony

8

pervades.

9

The -- the -- counsel for the government

10

seems to indicate that we look at 3584(b), we agree that

11

it limits -- that there has to be that 30-year

12

consecutive sentence, but it just guides the court's

13

discretion with respect to the 3553(a) factors.

14

doesn't say that they only apply to each count, not the

15

aggregate sentence.

16

the third provision, it talks about the aggregate

17

sentence in itself.

18

It

And you look at 3584 and you read

So the -- the reliance by the government on

19

3584 is -- we -- we say is misplaced and does not affect

20

whether or not the -- the total sentencing scheme that

21

the parsimony requirements put on ends the result of the

22

court determining what sentence is sufficient, but not

23

greater than necessary.

24
25

We don't quarrel that 30 years must be
imposed under the mandatory minimums.

Alderson Reporting Company

What we do

Official - Subject to Final Review

53

quarrel with is whether or not the court should be able

2

to take that -- those factors into consideration, as

3

well as all those other factors that are set forth in

4

3553(a), 3551, 3661, which gives us the -- the
