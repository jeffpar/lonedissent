ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

We'll hear argument

MS. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

A smartphone is smart because it contains

12

hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it

13

work.

14

the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design

15

patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to

16

total profit on the entire phone.

But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of

17

That result makes no sense.

18

patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone

19

should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the

20

profit on the entire phone.

21

A single design

Section 289 does not require that result,

22

and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing,

23

Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does

24

not require that result.

25

Court hold that when a design patent claims a design

We respectfully ask that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

that is applied to a component of a phone or a component

2

of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289,

3

when a design patent is applied to an article of

4

manufacture within a multi-article product, we request

5

that you hold that Section 289 entitles the

6

patent-holder to total profit on the article of

7

manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and

8

not the profits on the total product.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The problem is, is how to

10

instruct the jury on that point.

11

government, both parties kind of leave it up and say,

12

oh, give it to the juror.

13

wouldn't know what to do under your -- under your test.

14

Both parties, not the

If I were the juror, I simply

My preference, if -- if I were just making

15

another sensible rule, is we'd have market studies to

16

see how the -- the extent to which the design affected

17

the consumer, and then the jury would have something to

18

do that.

19

into the statute.

20

But that's apportionment, which runs headlong

You can't really have apportionment, so it

21

seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to

22

have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example

23

that's in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is

24

a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and

25

just follow the words of the statute.

Alderson Reporting Company

But it seems to

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.

2

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One -- I mean, it's one

4

thing to leave it to the jury.

5

if I were the juror, I wouldn't know what to do under

6

your brief.

7

MS. SULLIVAN:

It's the other thing --

Your Honor, we do not propose

8

a test that simply leaves it to the jury without

9

guidance.

The instruction we proposed and that was

10

rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief

11

at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that

12

the article of manufacture to which a design has been

13

applied is the part or portion of the product as sold

14

that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the

15

patent.

16
17
18

So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very
simple.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

don't know what to do.

20

room; I'd -- I'd look at it.

21

If I'm the juror, I just

I'd have the iPhone in the jury

MS. SULLIVAN:

I just wouldn't know.

Your Honor, what we

22

respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the

23

test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.

24

And to be clear, I'm now stressing our

25

article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

argument we gave as an alternative.

2

As the case comes to the Court, all we ask

3

is that you rule in favor of us on article of

4

manufacture.

5
6

And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us
what to look at --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I really quickly make

8

sure I understand that, that in other words, you're --

9

you're saying we should only look to what an article of

10

manufacture is and not your other argument that there

11

should be apportionment as to any particular article of

12

manufacture.

13

MS. SULLIVAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

14

We're pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the

15

case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit

16

must be profit derived from the article of manufacture

17

to which the design has been applied.

18

And, Your Honor, the statute does support

19

our test because the statute asks us to look at the

20

article of manufacture to which the design has been

21

applied.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what is that in

this -- in this case?
MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, in this case it

is -- there are three patents.

The D'677 is on the

In the D'087, it's also the rectangular,

4

5

aspect ratio and corner radii.

6
7

In the D'305, it is the display screen on
which the graphical user interface appears.

8
9

So, to answer Justice Kennedy's question,
the jury should have been instructed either with our

10

instruction:

11

jury, I'm giving you guidance.

12

manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire

13

14

portion of the phone, and you should look at two things,

15

Your Honor.

16

Instruction 42.1 would have said to the
There's an article of

You should look at the patent, and, Justice

17

Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn't just look at

18

the -- at the phones in the jury room.

19

look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent

20

is going to be the best guide to what the design is

21

applied to in many, many cases, as in this case.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You ought to

Ms. Sullivan, you seem

23

to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of

24

law, you were right.

25

of law.

And I don't see that as a matter

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

I believe that your basic argument, everyone

2

is in agreement, that the test is an article of

3

manufacture for purposes of sale.

4

But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how

5

do we announce the right test for that?

6

phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer

7

as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell.

8

might be what drives the sale.

Because the

figure out the component part.

12

argument.

14

That

MS. SULLIVAN:

I don't know where in

So, Your Honor, let me back

up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence.

15

The -- the test -- and I want to agree with

16

Your Honor.

To be clear, we say that what the Federal

17

Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law.

18

as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is

19

necessarily the article of manufacture from which you

20

measure total profit.

21

but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to

22

hold we're right on the article as a matter of law.

23

It's an -- it's a -- it's a question of

It is wrong

That's wrong as a matter of law,

24

either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel

25

question of law and fact.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

And why does it involve both?

Because we

2

know that district courts look at patents.

You assign

3

them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily.

4

when they look at a patent for a claim construction,

5

we're asking for part of the test to be very similar.

6

The district court can look at the patent

And

7

and say, oh, this is Apple's front face patent.

8

isn't one of Apple's 13 other patents on other parts of

9

the phone, or Apple's other patent on the design of the

10
11

entire case.

This

This is the front face patent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then how do -- how would

12

you determine the profit attributable to the relevant

13

article of manufacture?

14

MS. SULLIVAN:

15

First, through ordinary accounting that

16

would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to

17

revenues for the relevant component.

18

Three ways, Your Honor.

You could look, if -- if a company buys the

19

component from an original equipment manufacturer, you

20

would look to their profit margins and apply that.

21

If, as sometimes happens within a company,

22

one division makes the glass front face and another

23

division makes the innards of the phone, you would find

24

out the transfer pricing between the divisions.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So we find out the -- the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on

2

the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the

3

face, then it's a 10:1 ratio.

4
5

MS. SULLIVAN:
Honor.

Apple didn't --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

testimony on all of that.

8

MS. SULLIVAN:

9

That's absolutely right, Your

So you'd have expert

Yes, Your Honor, you would.

And you would -- but that's just one way.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose you had

11

a case where it's a stroke of genius, the design.

12

in two days, they come up with a design -- let's --

13

let's assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of

14

the briefs refer to.

15

design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of

16

genius and it identified the car.

17

that that's quite unfair to say, well, we give three

18

days' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop

19

the motor.

20

Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle

MS. SULLIVAN:

we would do with the Beetle.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

Then it seems to me

Well, Your Honor, here's what

21

23

In --

I mean, that's what -- it

seems to me that that's what you would be arguing.
MS. SULLIVAN:

It's not, Your Honor.

To

answer Justice Ginsburg's question, there are three ways

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the

2

total profit from the relevant article of manufactures

3

here, the front face, or the display screen.

4

have been accounting.

5

demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested.

6

Apple could have said well, people really like the front

7

face disproportionately to all the other parts of the

8

phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence

9

to prove that.

One could

One could have been consumer

But -- and so accounting evidence or

10

indirect evidence through consumer survey.

11

Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total

12

profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be

13

a substantial part of the total profit on the product.

14

But, Your

Let's take the Beetle, or let's take a cool,

15

shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette.

16

It may be that the article of manufacture to which the

17

design patent is applied is just the exterior body of

18

the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay

19

much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.

20

They want to pay for the cool way it looks.

21

If that's so, it should be open to the

22

patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come

23

from the exterior of the car.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any difference in

practical terms between that and your causation argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

or apportionment?

2

MS. SULLIVAN:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Justice Alito.
What is the difference?
The difference is we concede

5

under article of manufacture that the holder of the

6

patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit

7

does not come entirely from the design.

8
9

Let me give you an example with a phone's
front face.

Consumers may value the front face because

10

it's scratch-resistant, because it's water-resistant,

11

because it's shatterproof.

12

patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all

13

the profits for the front face, even if it includes

14

profit from those non-design features of the front face,

15

where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test

16

would limit the profits to the profits from the design

17

parts rather than the functional parts.

18

that's a little bit overinclusive.

19

little more with article of manufacture than we do with

20

a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy

21

for that.

22

We're going to give the

So, Your Honor,

We're getting a

But the reason we think it's consistent with

23

Congress's purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress

24

was trying to do was provide a rule that gives

25

design-patent holders total profit from the article of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

manufacture.

2

That's a little bit overinclusive, because

3

if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue

4

in the Dobson cases, you'll get a little profit from the

5

design, and there will be a little extra you're getting

6

perhaps from the fiber or the weave.

7

was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say

8

that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say

9

that design causes value in a single article product

10

We think Congress

like a rug.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, I look at this

12

record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole

13

phone.

14

were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --

15

this was their argument to the jury and it sold the

16

Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,

17

that, you know, all smartphones basically function the

18

same.

19

This is what they were arguing, and they put on an

20

expert that gave total profits.

21

them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a

22

properly instructed jury, could you overturn that

23

finding?

24
25

If you read the Federal Circuit's decision, they

People don't really put much value on the unit.

MS. SULLIVAN:
the proper instruction.

If the jury credited

Your Honor, let's go back to
The jury was not properly

instructed here.

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Miss Sullivan.

4

I accept that,

I'm asking you --

MS. SULLIVAN:

Two answers, Your Honor.

If

5

the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental

6

appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on

7

the entire outside of the phone, why didn't they assert

8

it here?

9

does not look substantially similar to the entire

Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone

10

outside of a Samsung phone.

11

patencies carve the product up into multiple partial

12

design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement

13

argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which

14

infringement can be found, and it's inappropriate to

15

give total profit when they do that.

16

The reason why design

So, Your Honor, if there had been a design

17

patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple

18

could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And you're answering

20

"no" to my question.

21

instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case

22

could not have found for Apple.

23
24
25

You're saying a properly

MS. SULLIVAN:

Is that what --

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is very much our position.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So besides the jury

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

instruction, what was the legal error?

2
3

MS. SULLIVAN:

The legal error was in the

jury instruction --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I said besides a

5

properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor

6

of Apple on the evidence presented?

7
8

MS. SULLIVAN:

They could not, Your Honor,

because --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so what, besides the

10

jury instruction -- 'cause I'm assuming that a proper

11

instruction was given -- what would have been the legal

12

error?

13

MS. SULLIVAN:

There would have been -- no

14

reasonable jury could have found on this record that the

15

entire product was the article of manufacture to which

16

the design has been applied.

17

Two reasons.

One, design patents cover ornamental

18

appearance.

19

innards of the phone.

20

phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design

21

patent.

22

They cannot, by definition, cover the
So the functional innards of the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you can't claim

23

the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn't cover the

24

innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find

25

its -- could find that the consumers and others would

1

perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks

2

only.

3

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, we're talking

4

about design patents, not trademark or copyright.

5

There's no requirement of consumer confusion here on

6

the --

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't disagree with

you, but --

9

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, let me answer

10

your question as precisely as I can.

11

can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle

12

exterior does not mean the car is the article of

13

manufacture.

14
15

Just because you

There's two steps here in our test.
First, determine what is the article of

manufacture.

16

Then second step, determine the quantum of

17

damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that

18

article.

19

Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost

20

all its profits from the exterior case, people were

21

indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail,

22

navigate, take photos, or any other functions.

23

could prove that it's a counterfactual that couldn't

24

happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette

25

or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the

Alderson Reporting Company

If you

article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of

the total product and the profit.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article

JUSTICE ALITO:

The Solicitor General has

article question.

4

others you would add?

Do you agree with those?

Are there

Your Honor, I'll answer

briefly, and then I'd like to reserve my time.

7

We -- we like the Solicitor General's test.

We propose a briefer test that we think is more

administrable.

We propose that you look to two factors:

10

The design in the patent and the accused product.

11

think our test is more administrable, and it can often

12

be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in

guidance.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

21

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

22

SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

23
24
25

We

MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case presents two related questions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

about the scope of the remedy that's available for

2

design-patent infringement under Section 289.

3

understood my friend Ms. Sullivan's presentation

4

correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both

5

of those legal questions.

6

If I

Just to summarize briefly, first, the court

7

of appeals correctly held that Section 289's provision

8

for an award of total profits means that the

9

patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the

10

sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not

11

just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder

12

can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as

13

opposed to other features of the article.

14

But second, we read the court of appeals'

15

opinion to have held that the relevant article of

16

manufacture for which profits are owed is always the

17

entire product that the infringer sells to customers.

18

And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all

19

parties to agree with that now.

20

Instead, the relevant article of manufacture

21

to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes

22

be a part or a component of a larger product sold in

23

commerce.

24

agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the

25

profits from that infringing article and not to all --

And when that is the case, all parties now

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When the -- when the

2

component -- when the article of manufacture isn't sold

3

apart from the entire product, how should the -- the

4

judge charge the jury on determining the profit

5

attributable to the infringing article?

6

MR. FLETCHER:

So we think that there'd be

7

two factual questions in a case where that's disputed.

8

The first one would be what is the relevant article, and

9

there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case.

10

The second question, once the fact-finder

11

identifies the relevant article, is the question that

12

you asked, which is how much of the total profits from

13

the device are attributable to the infringing article?

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

and how do you figure it out?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

What's the first step,

May he -- may he complete

his answer to my question?

18

MR. FLETCHER:

So Justice Ginsburg, on the

19

second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a

20

lot of detail because it hasn't been briefed in this

21

case.

22

we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that

23

courts have handled other analogous questions, and I

24

point to two areas of law where that's happened.

25

This case sort of stopped at the first step.

The first is utility patent damages under

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the

2

infringer's profits.

3

patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in

4

commerce, and the fact-finder would say you're entitled

5

to the profits that are attributable to the infringing

6

part, but not the whole machine.

7

And in those cases, very often a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is Justice -- Justice

8

Ginsburg's question.

9

adequately summarized, the test that you propose at

10

Is that -- is your answer to her,

page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include?

11

MR. FLETCHER:

So I think the test we

12

propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions

13

that I was speaking to, which is what's the article of

14

manufacture to which the design has been applied?

15

the fact-finder makes that judgment, that's the test

16

that we proposed, and that's, I think, I took to be

17

Justice Sotomayor's question.

Once

18

I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking

19

once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article

20

is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on

21

the car, how do they separate out the part of the

22

profits that are attributable to that component from the

23

whole.

24
25

And as to that question, we haven't briefed
it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that

2

courts have confronted in other areas of law.

3

utility patent damages, as I described.

4

discussed at some length in this Court's decision in the

5

Sheldon case under the Copyright Act.

6

where the copyright was on a script --

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. FLETCHER:

That was a case

Would expert witnesses be

I -- I would think very often

both.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what would those

12

expert witnesses -- who would they be?

13

say?

14

Another one is

called on in order to show part one or part two or both?

9
10

One was

MR. FLETCHER:

What would they

So I think it will depend

15

on -- on the circumstances of the case.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. FLETCHER:

In this case.

In this case, I think someone

18

familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in

19

the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone

20

company, or someone who is familiar with the market for

21

smartphones and who could speak to on the first question

22

how smartphones are put together, how they are

23

manufactured, how they're used by the users, the extent

24

to which the components of a smartphone are separable.

25

And then on the second question, the one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would --

2

the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be

3

speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in

4

your question in the Sullivan, which is things like

5

consumer surveys, to what extent do the various

6

components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and

7

contribute to the value of the phone.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one of the

things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that.

10

don't understand how that helps on this question.

11

would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it

12

contributed to profits.

I

It

13

MR. FLETCHER:

14

Justice, it will depend on the case.

15

you might try to build up the share of the profits from

16

the bottom up by saying, what's the cost of each of

17

these components, and then what share of the revenue is

18

attributable to each of these components.

19

say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20

20

percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up

21

calculation and try to do it that way.

22

So I think, Mr. Chief
Sometimes you --

And then you

Courts haven't always done that.

Sometimes

23

that won't be feasible.

Sometimes instead they've --

24

they've done a more impressionistic approximation and

25

said the total profits on this product are $10 million,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

and we think that the component at issue here, based on

2

expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or

3

25 percent.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

on expert testimony.

6

talking about?

7

But you said based

What would -- what would they be

MR. FLETCHER:

So I think the -- the Sheldon

8

case that's cited on page 27 of our brief from this

9

Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these

10

problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion

11

the portion -- the profits from a movie that are

12

attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or

13

the directors or other things.

14

were familiar with the industry and who said the script

15

is important but, really, a lot of the value and

16

particularly for a movie like this comes from other

17

things.

And they had experts who

18

And there were various expert testimonies

19

that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up

20

saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of

21

the total profits from the movie, and this Court

22

affirmed that award and said that's a reasonable

23

approximation.

24
25

We're not -- never going to be able to get
to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable

2

approximation is good enough, and it's certainly better

3

than awarding all or nothing.

4

to come to those reasonable approximations by using

5

expert testimony in some of the ways that we've

6

discussed.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And courts have been able

Mr. Fletcher, could you

8

speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I

9

understand Ms. Sullivan's answer, she said, well, that

10

distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it's

11

just -- it's still -- the article is only the body of

12

the car.

13

question as to whether it is being -- the design is

14

being applied to the car itself.

And -- and you say, no, there's a real

15

So how would you go about thinking about

16

that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and

17

under what instructions?

18

MR. FLETCHER:

So we think the basic

19

question for the fact-finders, what's the article of

20

manufacture to which the design has been applied.

21

think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court's

22

observation in Gorham.

23

case that the -- what a design is, is it's the thing

24

that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of

25

manufacture.

We

It's 1871, first design patent

Alderson Reporting Company

And the point we're making with the VW Bug

2

example is that in some cases, that's going to be very

3

easy.

4

latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the

5

distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator.

If the patented design is for a refrigerator

6
7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But let's talk about

the hard cases.

8
9

Right.

MR. FLETCHER:

Right.

So the hard cases,

like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it's either

10

the body or the car.

11

factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the

12

jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those

13

factors.

14

the patented design as shown in the drawings in the

15

patent, how prominently that design features in the

16

accused article, whether there are other conceptually

17

distinct innovations or components in the article that

18

are not part of or associated with the patented design,

19

and finally the physical relationship between the

20

patented design and the rest of the article.

21

Then we've given the Court four

And so we say you should compare the scope of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If you were a juror, how

22

would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would

23

you want to hear?

24

MR. FLETCHER:

I would want to hear as -- as

25

to the article, what's the article --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1
2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Shouldn't have given you

that second option.

3

MR. FLETCHER:

I -- I do think it's a

4

factual question.

5

experts who can speak to the question of how is the

6

Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the

7

Beetle --

8
9

I do think you'd want to hear from

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
put together?

How is the Beetle

It's put together like every other car.

10

I mean, I don't see how that's going to tell you whether

11

the shape of the body is distinctive or not.

12

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think you'd also want

13

to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that

14

the scope of the claim design covers the whole article,

15

but not the interior of the car.

16

features in the interior that the driver sees that

17

aren't the body of the article.

18

There are design

As to the second factor, how prominent is

19

the design feature, I think that's one that cuts in

20

favor of finding that the design does cover the whole

21

article.

22

Then the third one is conceptually distinct

23

innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way.

24

There are going to be lots of other features of the car

25

or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering

might want to hear adverse testimony.

5

MR. FLETCHER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Correct.
That's the article of

manufacture.

8
9

But that's the first

So now take the second part of the test and
apply it to the Bug.

10

MR. FLETCHER:

So supposing that we've

11

decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug

12

is just the body of the Bug.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. FLETCHER:

Exactly.

Then I think the question is

15

the best way to determine that, at least that I can

16

think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed

17

to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their

18

purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and

19

to what extent are they instead valuing other things

20

like --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you think that that

22

question is not relevant to the first question.

23

other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs

24

buy them because of the look of the car.

25

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you think that that's

2

only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1,

3

which is the question of whether it's the body or the

4

whole car that the design is being applied to?

5

MR. FLETCHER:

I do.

I think that's the

6

statute -- the way the statute reads.

7

profits from the article of manufacture.

8

logically, I think the way to approach it would be

9

identify the article and then let the patent-holder make

It says you get
And so,

10

the argument that even though the article may be just a

11

part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it's just

12

the case of the front face -- really, that's what sells

13

it.

14

in a case where it is the design of the article that's

15

selling the whole product, still recover a very

16

substantial portion of the profits --

And so that that test still lets the patent-holder,

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. FLETCHER:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

But this hypothetical is --- in a different way.
This hypothetical is not

20

helpful to me, because I can't get over the thought that

21

nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like

22

the way it looks.

23

$1800 when it was first sold in the United States?

24

if it cost $18,000?

25

What if it broke down every 50 miles?

What if it, you know, costs, I think,
What

What if it got 2 miles per gallon?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

So if that is a real question, if it is a

2

real question whether the article of manufacture there

3

is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about

4

the test for determining what is the article of

5

manufacture.

6

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think that those

7

things can be taken into account at the second step of

8

the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the

9

relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car,

10

but for all of the reasons you just pointed out.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

But what if you -- you

12

were saying it's an open -- it would be a difficult

13

question.

14

determine what is the article of manufacture there.

15

You'd have to apply numerous factors to

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I -- then I think if

16

you're skeptical about that, I think our test for

17

article of manufacture also lets some of those

18

considerations play into that test, because it gets to

19

whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions,

20

or other components of the product unrelated to the

design.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

3

Before I address the Court's many questions

4

initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury

5

be instructed under what we and the government believe

6

to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test

7

of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the

8

article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I

9

think it's very clear to address the questions that

10

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and

11

Ms. Sullivan's response to what actually happened in

12

this case.

13

There is no -- whatever you determine the

14

right instruction should be, there is no basis to

15

overturn the jury's damages verdict in this case.

16

There were two trials below.

In neither

17

trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or

18

witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any

19

article of manufacture other than the phones themselves.

20

In both trials, Samsung's expert witness, Mr. Wagner,

21

calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones

22

themselves.

23

in these trials could possibly have awarded total

24

profits on anything other than the phones, unless this

these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

So disagreement on this

11

point.

So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question

12

trying to figure out what the standard is.

13

can't we just ask the lower courts to listen to your

14

arguments and theirs, and work it out?

15
16

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer, this is not a

difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult.

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

You don't think it's

difficult, but they think --

19

21

Now, why

difficult.

Well --- they think it's

In fact, they think it's easy on their side.
So if I go through and come to the

23

conclusion, at least, that each side has a good

24

argument, under those circumstances, why don't we focus

25

on the question that is of great importance across

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35

industries and leave the application of that and whether

2

it was properly raised to the lower courts?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer, if this were

4

difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this

5

Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think

6

there is a great need for this Court to do.

7

not suggesting that it wouldn't -- that it isn't

8

necessary for the Court to do it.

9

And we're

This is a case very much like global tech,

10

when you found that the lower court had applied the

11

wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then

12

found that the record -- even -- but under the correct

13

higher standard, the record admitted no other

14

conclusion.

15

never identified to the jury, in either case, any

16

article of manufacture other than the phone.

17

their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on

18

the total profits to the phone.

And all of

I get your point.

I'll

read it and I'll --

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I have a question on

23

the general issue, which I think is tough.

And the

24

general question that I have is I have been looking for

25

a standard.

Now, one of the standards -- which are all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

quite close; the parties actually in the government are

2

fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the

3

Internet Association, the software industry.

know that brief I'm talking about on Facebook and some

5

others.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you

I do.
Okay.

What they did is

8

they went back into history.

They have a lot of

9

different cases which they base the standard on, and

10

they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague,

11

but that the design where it's been applied to only

12

part -- it's on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product

13

and does not drive demand for the entire product, the

14

article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only

15

the component to which the design applies.

16

profit attributable to that component may be awarded.

17

And only

Now, really, to understand it, you have to

Here is what I would say.

In a

case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing

14

articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should

15

be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find

16

infringement, total profits are awarded on the article

17

of manufacture to which the patented design was applied

18

for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar

19

or distinctive appearance.

manufacture is the entire product or a distinct

component of that product.

on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would

include the Solicitor General's, and there may be other

things.

For example, most importantly the identity of

what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers.

Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers

to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the

patentee's product.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- maybe I'm not

7

grasping the difficulties in the case.

8

that the design is applied to the exterior case of the

10

It seems to me

It's not applied to the -- all the chips and

11

MR. WAXMAN:

That's right.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. WAXMAN:

That's absolutely right.

there shouldn't be profits awarded based on the entire

think the -- the difficulty here is that it's important

2

to understand that design is not a component and the

article of manufacture.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

How is the design of the case

The same way that -- I mean, if

11

you look at, for example, in the early days, when the

12

patent -- when the design -- when design patents were

13

first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred --

14

of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of

15

them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and

16

things like that.

17

you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson

cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is

infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not

20

happen innocently.

will depend on the evidence that the parties educe --

it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody

else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards,

18

are the article of manufacture.

19

Now, the government would say, go to the

20

second test, which takes in some of the things that you

21

were talking about, to figure out how much of the

22

profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to

the shape of the car.

What's wrong with that analysis?

analysis to be.

That that's what a jury has to be told

to do, to decide how much value the design is to the

product being sold.

12

nutshell.

13

That's the government's test in a

MR. WAXMAN:

So -- okay.

So this is a test

14

that the government has articulated here at oral

15

argument.

16

It has not been briefed by anybody.
The issue of how you calculate total profits

17

on something less than the whole article as sold was

18

wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in

19

the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case,

20

the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test,

21

how do you determine what the article of manufacture is,

22

hasn't provided a lot of difficulty.

23

difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the

24

profits from that article of manufacture.

25

The real

The -- the few courts that have addressed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

this that I've seen it have done it in a way that I

2

think probably makes the most sense and is the least

3

difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were

4

the costs of producing that article, that particular

5

subcomponent, and what was the company's profit margin

6

on the product as a whole applied to that little

7

component?

8
9

Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I
think that's what courts have generally done.

And what

10

it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be

11

appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it

12

underscores is the very --

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Please don't get off

track.

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Do you endorse that part

of the government's test?

that right?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

The government

But is -- conceptually, is

Conceptually, it is correct

22

that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the

23

total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture

24

to which the design has been applied.

25

relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,

Alderson Reporting Company

That is

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is

2

the product that's sold.

3

the jury concludes that the relevant article of

4

manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where

5

customers could choose an array of cases in which to put

6

the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out

7

total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case.

It is more complicated when

8

But the decided cases that I have seen have

9

looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what

10

were the direct costs associated with producing the

11

relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on

12

the piano as applied to that.

13

And may I just add one other point which I

14

think is still on track.

The problem with that is that

15

it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress

16

was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design

17

Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters

18

and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only

19

compensation was something that could be viewed as the

20

cost of doing business, that is okay, you're going to

21

get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to

22

produce this little component, there would be no

23

deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency.

24

Yes, Justice Kagan.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let's take a case -- and I

reason -- where the thing that makes the product

4

been a lot of input.

some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said

that's the principal reason why the product has been

There's not

But

I mean, the car has to run, and it has to

10

reason why the car has been successful has to do with

11

this particular appearance, the design.

12

As I understood the government, that does

13

not come into the first inquiry.

That does not come

14

into the question of what is the article.

15

into the second inquiry, which is how much of the

16

profits are attributable to that article.

17

Do you agree with that?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

It only comes

I don't think that that -- I

19

don't agree with -- if that is the government's test as

20

you have articulated it, I wouldn't agree with that.

21

think that the government's -- if you look at the

22

government's factors, you know, one factor is the

23

relative prominence of the design within the product as

24

a whole.

25

design -- in other words, whether the design is a

And the government says that whether the

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

significant attribute of the entire product affecting

2

the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest

3

that the article should be the product.

4

Another factor in the government's test is

5

the physical relationship between the patented design

6

and the rest of the product.

7

government's brief says, can the user or the seller

8

physically separate it, or is it manufactured

9

separately.

10

In other words, as the

Another factor is whether the design is

11

conceptually different from the product as a whole, as,

12

for example, a design on a book binding is different

13

from the intellectual property reflected in the

14

copyright material in the book.

15

all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly,

16

you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the

17

first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence

18

of the design within the product of the whole is in

19

essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in

20

determining the article of manufacture -- whether the

21

patented design is likely to cause the consumers to

22

purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the

23

patentee's product.

24

can't bring myself to call it a "bug."

25

example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was

Those -- we agree with

So in the VW Beetle example -- I

similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or

2

a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW.

3

who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the

4

iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say

5

that, and a jury would take that into account.

approach that you're discussing fairly described as

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What other -- what -- what

word would you use to describe your approach?

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But once you've identified

23

the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily

24

what you're doing is apportioning profits.

25

see how we can get away from that word.

Alderson Reporting Company

I just don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

In this sense, Justice

2

Kennedy, the vernacular sense of "apportionment," once

3

you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at

4

step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture

5

is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we

6

determine total profits from the sale of that thing?

7

You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that

8

looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and

9

what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for

10

the car or the refrigerator or something like that.

11

That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if

12

you found it.

13

So, you know, in this case it's a little

14

difficult to figure out what the alternative article of

15

manufacture would be.

before the trial judge, they never even suggested what

The factors are helpful in making the

2

Is that -- is that basically what you said?
MR. WAXMAN:

What I would tell the jury is

3

quoting the statute and this Court's decision in 1872

decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture

5

is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes

6

of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing,

That's all you're trying to find

Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that

all apportionment is forbidden.

42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary

15

judgment that the article of manufacture is the front

16

face, and that could be instructed to the jury.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem, of course, is

18

that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though

19

they only want to apply it to the front.

20

MS. SULLIVAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your Honor -And that's the problem in

22

the case.

So I thought -- and that's why I pointed to

23

the brief I did point to -- that history is matters

24

here, and we're talking here about a multicomponent

25

product.

MS. SULLIVAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right, Your Honor.
And if you don't tell the

3

jury that there is that distinction, I think you either

4

disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you

5

create the kind of absurd results that your brief is

6

full of.

So that's what I'm looking for.

7

MS. SULLIVAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Your Honor -And that's why I looked at

page 23, and it says that seems to do it.

10

MS. SULLIVAN:

We're fine with page 23 of

11

the tech company's brief, and that points to why you

12

must remand in this case.

13

This case was tried under the improper rule

14

of law.

forbade apportionment.

manufacture.

19

on that.

20

We tried at every juncture to get the correct
And the district court said, I
And we said, no, no, we're not

And we were shut down over and over again

So you must remand and tell the nation's

21

economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on

22

a portion of a front face of an electronic device and

23

come in and get the entire profits on the phone.

24

should be instructed that the article of manufacture

25

either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice

Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary

2

articles, just like the Dobson rugs.

3

might be a unitary article.

4

but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the

5

spoon.

So we say the article of manufacture is the

spoon.

And if you get the profits from the spoon,

that's all right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who has the burden of

showing what is the relevant article?

I assume in a

case like this, Apple will say it's the whole phone.

11

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Ginsburg, if I leave

12

you with the most important disagreement we have with

13

the government and with Apple, the burden is on the

14

plaintiff.

15

the article of manufacture is.

16

The burden is on the plaintiff to show what

Why is that?

The burden is on the plaintiff

17

to show damages.

And subsidiary questions subsumed in

18

what the damages are are also always the plaintiff's

19

burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal

20

Circuit shows.

21

remand -- vacate and remand.

With respect, we request that you

Thank you very much, Your Honor.
