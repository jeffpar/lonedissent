CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

in Case 15-1262, McCrory v. Harris.

5

Mr. Clement.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case involves the -- the

11

constitutionality of two congressional districts in

12

North Carolina that should be familiar to the Court

13

because they've been before the Court on multiple prior

14

occasions.

15

Even though the two congressional districts

16

here -- and they're both North Carolina congressional

17

districts -- the issues presented by the two districts

18

are actually quite distinct.

19

With respect to Congressional District 12,

20

it is different from both the House of Delegates

21

districts in the previous case and Congressional

22

District 1, because this was not a district that was

23

drawn with an avowed intent to create a

24

majority-minority district to comply with the Voting

25

Rights Act; rather, with respect to Congressional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

District 12, this was avowedly a political draw.

2

Now, if that all sounds familiar, it's

3

because it's the exact same dynamic that was before this

4

Court in Cromartie II.

5

in reversing a district court on the clear error

6

standard, concluded when the State actually said this

7

was a political draw, that race did not predominate over

8

politics in the drawing of this district.

9

And in Cromartie II, this Court,

And that is essentially the exact same

10

dynamic that is before this Court now with one major

11

difference.

12

to reverse than Cromartie II was, because -- and even

13

before this Court gets to the clear error standard of

14

review, there is a clear legal error here that was

15

created by my friends on the other sides and the

16

district court's failure to abide by the teaching of

17

Cromartie II.

18

This is a much easier case for this Court

I think Cromartie II was about as clear as

19

it could have been, that in a case where you have a

20

majority-minority district or something approximating

21

it, and you have race and politics highly correlated,

22

and you have somebody challenging the State's suggestion

23

that this is a political and not a racial draw, what the

24

plaintiffs must show -- not can show, not may show, not

25

it would be nice that they show -- must show, is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

there are alternative ways that the legislature could

2

have accomplished its political goals without a

3

comparable emphasis on race --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, that passage

5

in -- in Cromartie II says in a case like this one.

6

And -- and it's pretty clearly following off analysis

7

of -- in a case with purely circumstantial evidence,

8

rather than direct evidence of race-based districting.

9

I think you would have heard it, and it

10

would have sounded different if the Court had really

11

meant that in every case where the question was, is this

12

politics or is this race, there was a requirement to

13

present maps.

14

differently.

15
16

That passage just would have read a lot

MR. CLEMENT:

I respectfully disagree,

Justice Kagan, for at least two reasons.

17

One is, there was direct evidence in

18

Cromartie II; and, indeed, the direct evidence is eerily

19

similar.

20

drawer -- drawer himself had taken race into account

21

with the treatment of the African-American community in

22

Greensboro, which is Guilford County.

In Cromartie II, you had evidence that the map

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I wrote was in a case

such as this one.

that mean, "in a case such as this one"?

And then people can argue:

JUSTICE BREYER:

What does

By the time we reach the

6

Alabama case, there is a need seen by a majority of the

7

Court to try to bring clarity.

8

9

should.

10

We're speaking as a

Not every individual gets his own way, or

And so if we go back into an area and try to

11

reconcile the cases and try to come up with, in a

12

complicated area, a set of standards that will prevent

13

us from being -- turning into the nineteenth court of

14

evidence to consider some highly detailed matters and so

15

forth, you know, all the problems here, I would take

16

that -- or at least I'd start taking that last case,

17

the -- the -- the Alabama case, as at least trying to

18

set the way in which a district court should go about

19

deciding a case such as this one.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

Well, just -Do I not do that?

No, in the following respect,

which is Alabama and Cromartie II are different cases.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CLEMENT:

Uh-huh.

And I'll take your point that

Alabama is this Court's last, best guidance on how to

2

deal with a case like Alabama and like Congressional

3

District 1 where you have a State that says, why did we

4

do it?

5

We wanted to draw a majority-minority district.

The Voting Rights Act made us do it.

6

We did it.

But Cromartie II is this Court's last and

7

best word on cases like this, where the State says, why

did we do it?

We don't want to -- we looked

22

is it race?

23

it's not.

25

We're not

I mean, that's the question that the
Is it politics or

If it's politics, it's fine; if it's race,

And -- and so let's just take a
hypothetical.

Not this case, but let's take a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

hypothetical, which is:

2

do race-based districting.

3

all the African-American voters; this is the way we want

4

to do it.

5

we'll justify it based on politics, because that sounds

6

better, right?

A State really does decide to
Says, we want to segregate

But then they say, well, we'll -- we'll --

7

So -- and -- but -- but there's lots of

8

direct evidence that, in fact, the justification is

9

politics, but the true reason is race.

10

Now, were you suggesting when you stood --

11

when -- when -- in -- in -- in your -- in your first

12

statements there, were you suggesting that even if a

13

plaintiff comes in and has all this direct evidence that

14

they are really trying to do race, that the plaintiff

15

has to present its own maps?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

And I would say yes.

And I

17

would say why not?

18

situation where the plaintiff is going and asking a

19

Federal court, in this case after they've already asked

20

the State court and lost -- I'll get into that later

21

maybe.

22

that a sovereign State legislature that says it's

23

politics was dissembling, and it's actually race.

24

That's a big thing to ask of a Federal court.

25

I mean, we're talking about a

But we're asking a Federal court to say and hold

It's a unique thing in these Cromartie II

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

cases, which is different from what you're asking a

2

Federal court to do, when the State is forthright that,

3

we took race into account to comply with the Voting

4

Rights Act.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's also a big thing to

6

ask plaintiffs to come in with their own maps, if they

7

have direct evidence that the State is doing race-based

8

rather than politics-based districting.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm -- I guess I'm a

10

little less troubled by being demanding of plaintiffs

11

than I am of putting sovereign State legislatures in a

12

difficult position.

13

evidence, gosh, I think the alternative map drawing is

14

going to be a breeze.

15

really -- all this direct evidence that this was really

16

about race and -- and -- and the idea that this was

17

about politics is just a pretext, I think it's going to

18

be easy as pie to show, well, actually, right here you

19

could have drawn this map differently and you would not

20

have taken race into account.

21

And if there's all that direct

I mean, if -- you know, if there

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Not so easy, because we know

22

that race and politics correlate.

23

is -- is not -- I mean, that's just a fact of the

24

matter.

25

is your motive, you get one result; and if politics is

And the question

But we've said, notwithstanding that, if race

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1
2

your motive, you get another result.
So these maps are actually hard to do, given

3

the extent of correlation there is, but direct evidence

4

of race-based -- which, I have to say, there really is

5

some in this case, because the principal line-drawer

6

says, they told me to get above 50 percent BVAP --

7

direct evidence, you know, that basically makes the case

8

for somebody.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, just to be

10

clear, that -- that -- the direct evidence of the map

11

drawer actually is incredibly helpful for my clients as

12

to CD12, because the same guy who had no problem saying

13

as to CD1, it's above 50.1 percent, also testified that

14

he had exactly the opposite instructions for drawing

15

CD12, and that when he drew the map he didn't even look

16

at racial data.

17

election and the political results from that, and drew

18

the map in order to bring in Democrat voters and exclude

19

Republican voters.

He looked at the 2008 presidential

So -- and -- and that's --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Didn't --

I'm sorry.
Didn't he say that he

23

was told specifically to not consider race except with

24

respect to Guilford County?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1
2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is probably the

most important piece of this discussion.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's not what he said.

4

He didn't say -- he -- he basically was -- said, look,

5

do it as a political draw, and then you're going to have

6

to, essentially, check what you did in Guilford County

7

with the African-American community, because Guilford

8

County is a covered jurisdiction.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We can go back to the

10

original deposition testimony, which is what the

11

district court -- I think what the court below relied

12

on.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

But you look at

14

that deposition testimony and you look at his testimony

15

at trial and it all fits together, because he -- and,

16

again, he never says, oh, well, actually, when it came

17

to Guilford County, I turned off the political screen on

18

my map-drawing software and picked up the race-drawing

19

screen.

20

What he did is, the whole time he drew the

21

maps, he had political data up there.

22

race and politics are highly correlated, he drew the map

23

to draw the Democrats in and the Republicans out.

24

he checked his work specifically with respect to

25

Guilford County, and he did treat Guilford County

Alderson Reporting Company

Precisely because

Then

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

differently, and he should have because Guilford County

2

is the only covered jurisdiction in CD12.

3

and he said, all right.

4

community together.

5

And he looked

I got the African-American

I don't have a problem.

Well, my friends on the other side want to

6

take -- whatever quibble there is about Guilford County,

7

it's essentially uncontroverted here that with respect

8

to every other part of the map, race wasn't taken into

9

account at all.

It's essentially uncontroverted because

10

nobody says he turned the political stuff off for

11

Guilford County.

12

as to Guilford County to make sure there wasn't a

13

retrogression problem with Guilford County, which is

14

exactly what he should do, by the way.

15

eerie similarities.

16

So all he did is he did a crosscheck

But talk about

I mean, it was Guilford County and it was

17

Greensboro and Cromartie II, and what this Court said in

18

giving that direct evidence relatively minimal weight

19

was to say, well, you know, if you look at the rest of

20

that e-mail, the map drawer was very candid about taking

21

race into account in drawing CD1 and was much -- there's

22

much less race involved in CD12 so it didn't

23

predominate.

24
25

Again, the -- the similarities could not be
more dead-on with this case.

So the most you can get

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

out of Guilford County is that race was taken into

2

account in some way that did not make it predominate,

3

and the same evidence here as in Cromartie II, that, if

4

you contrast the way the legislature proceeded with

5

respect to CD1 and CD12, it's virtually impossible to

6

think that this was all a pretext.

7

I mean, you know, I -- I understand why you

8

want to search a little bit more when you have a

9

legislature who comes up with these racial maps and they

10

say, as to all of it, race had nothing to do with it.

11

But when the legislature repeatedly says we treated CD12

12

differently from CD1, I would think that you would want

13

pretty substantial evidence before you second-guess that

14

conclusion and overrode it.

15

would want the maps --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. CLEMENT:

18
19

And I would think that you

But isn't -- isn't it -You would want the maps.

And

if I could just -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Isn't there substantial

20

evidence that Congressman Watt comes in and he sits on

21

the witness stand and he says, I had a conversation with

22

the map drawer and the map drawer said that my bosses

23

told me I have to get up over 50.1 percent black votes.

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So it -That seems like substantial

evidence.

2

conversation he's had with the map drawer, who -- who --

3

who says he has received orders from on high.

4

A Congressman says -- reports on a direct

Well, no.

5

6

conversation ever took place.

And --

He -- see, that's

I mean, there's a dispute whether that

7

In the -- in the record in this case, you

8

have Senator Rucho, who protests that that's not what

9

happened.

10

You also have another witness.

That's all in

the record here.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wasn't there a

12

credibility finding?

13

the three-justice court say they credited Watt and not

14

Rucho?

15

Didn't the district judge say --

MR. CLEMENT:

They -- they -- they did say

16

that, but that only gets you to the point that -- okay.

17

I mean, maybe -- even if Rucho said that, it didn't get

18

translated to the map drawer.

19

multiple public statements that say that CD12 is not a

20

racial draw; it's a political draw.

Rucho and Lewis make

so highly correlated.

think that the problem in Cromartie II is it doesn't say

write that for a purpose.

15

when it says in a case like this one, it's a little

16

ambiguous, but it means it.

I understand it.

Believe me.

I mean, it's pretty clear.

And I -- I

MR. CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

We -By the time as time

19

progresses, as time progresses, we face what you see and

20

I see as the problem right now, which is a set of

21

standards that district courts can't apply, which will

22

try to separate sheep from goats, without us spending

23

the entire term reviewing 5,000-page records.

24
25

Right?

That is a problem that you have by the time
we -- pretty clear, by the time we get to the later

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

cases.

So I don't know.

2

I understand your argument.

I understand

3

your argument.

4

it's absolutely determinative, the Cromartie II.

5

not so sure.

6

I'll go back and look at it.

MR. CLEMENT:

You think
I'm

I think it's determinative,

7

because you didn't just say "in a case such as this

8

one."

9

a majority-minority district or a close approximation,

10

You said "in a case such as this one where" it's

and race and politics are closely correlated.

11

And I'll even give you a third criteria,

12

which is in the cases where the -- the legislature's

13

stated goal was politics, not race.

14

absolutely said it, but you are also absolutely right,

15

and before you decide whether it's sheep or goats, I

16

think it's perfectly fair to say that there are two

17

breeds here, generally.

And so it's -- you

18

There are the cases where -- and the more

19

common ones, the Alabama cases, the Shaw cases, those

20

are all cases where the State comes in and CD1 -- which

21

I'll talk about in a minute.

22

Those are all cases where
It was

And if it did, we survived strict

But there's a whole separate class of cases,

2

the smaller cases, where the State comes in and says it

3

wasn't race at all; it was politics.

4

highly correlated, but it was politics.

5

sensitive cases for the State, because if the State does

6

that, as this case shows, if they lose because they --

7

they're found to have dissembled, they don't even get to

8

the second half of the case, because I can't come up

9

here and argue that it was politics, not race.

And sure, they're
And it's very

But if

you think we're lying, by the way, we narrowly tailored.

And it's -- it's not the world's, you know,

20

biggest burden to come up with an alternative map.

21

if the alternative map shows that the way that you take

22

race -- rather, politics into account to the same extent

23

without -- with -- with better race is by pairing

incumbents or making a district that looks like this

they weren't, you know -- I mean, you know, it was not

case is that they actually showed that the legislature

6

was exactly right.

7

You looked at those alternative maps, and

The problem with alternative maps in that

JUSTICE BREYER:

What you want me to say is

8

even though the district court listened to the map

drawer and believed him, and his statements are pretty

10

much against you, and then they heard two of the State

11

senators, and they were pretty much against you, and

12

it's up to the district court to evaluate the strength

13

of witnesses, and came to the conclusion on the basis of

14

fact that, in fact, it was -- race was really the

15

explanation.

16

Despite that, everyone who comes in has to

17

have an alternative map.

18

five intervenors and so forth, we're going to have five

20

know, a hundred State legislatures and so forth.

And, of course, if we have

21

That's what I'm supposed to say?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, first of all, I don't

23

think that the direct evidence here is of a character

24

that is materially different from Cromartie II itself.

25

And I would say that, look, you're trying to give

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

district courts directions for a whole bunch of cases.

2

Everybody is going to be able to say, I have direct

3

evidence.

There's obviously going to be some direct

4

evidence.

The quality and character of it is going to

5

differ from case to case.

6

But what I think you should do is in this

7

class of cases, where the State's defense is politics

8

not race, is all five intervenors can get together, pool

9

the costs, which are going to be minimal, give me at

10

least one alternative map that shows that you can do the

11

same political thing without a comparable effect on

12

race.

13

I don't think that's too much to ask.

14

think it would make your jurisprudence much more

15

administrable.

16

applying stare decisis, because you did say it in

17

Cromartie II.

18

I

It would also have the virtue of

And again, you know, every one of this

19

Court's cases says that this is an extremely difficult

20

business, that it's an inherently legislative business,

21

that it is a humbling and big thing to have a court

22

second-guess these decisions.

23

So I think in a world like that, especially

24

when you've already said it, to say that there is an

25

alternative map requirement as a gatekeeping function,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

to guide a district court, to give the district court

2

the same tools you used in Cromartie II, to say, ah, you

3

know, it's easy to say that there was a pretext, but

4

when I actually look at this -- you know, and I'm going

5

to -- I'm going to -- at the end of the day, I mean, I'm

6

going to look at the alternative map in conjunction with

7

the direct evidence, the circumstantial evidence, but

8

I'm at least going to be guided by something that says,

9

you know, there was another way to do this, and that

10

really does make me think that this direct evidence is a

11

lot more probative than it might otherwise, because I

12

see there was an easy alternative.

23

of race.

24

25

And once it's met, you

Does it predominate?

You need just the use

That's the evil the

See, your way is to say that State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

legislatures go out and always say it's politics,

2

because it's real easy to say politics, even though

3

there's a lot of direct evidence that it really was

4

race, and put the added burden on a plaintiff now to do

5

a map where you'll come up and say on their map, oh, ah,

6

this takes care of this problem, but there's another

7

political reason for not doing it that way.

8

another political reason for not doing it this way.

9

It's impossible to ask a plaintiff to come up with a

10
11

There's

race-neutral map in light of the entire region.
The issue is, are the State legislators

12

prohibited from using race predominantly?

13

are and the proof is they have, then they should go back

14

to the drawing board and do it without it.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

And if they

Well, Your Honor, I think

16

that, sure, at the end of the day in these districts

17

where you basically have one party saying it was

18

politics and the other party is saying it's race, you do

19

ultimately have to have a mechanism for determining

20

which one it was.

21

And our humble point is everybody agrees

22

that they're highly correlated.

23

the possibility for abuse, so we're not saying there

24

shouldn't be any test.

25

know, this is a difficult thing.

That certainly creates

What we're saying is that, you
It is a particularly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

damning thing to say that a State legislature,

2

especially when they're being candid about their use of

3

race of CD1, to say that they were dissembling is a

4

pretty big thing.

5

in the case because there isn't going to be any strict

6

scrutiny to fix it on the back end because they're going

7

to say we don't take race into account at all.

8
9

And it's going to be the only issue

To simply say -- and it's certainly not
beyond the ken of man or woman or anyone else to come up

10

with an alternative map, and it's not just you're doing

11

it to be mean or imposing costs.

12

exceedingly useful for the analysis.

13

to look at the Cromartie II opinion to show how they can

14

really show, well, yeah, if you do that, you're going to

15

elongate it.

And that's not going to be the case in

16

every case.

In some cases, you'll be able to come up

17

with a perfectly functional alternative map.

18

They're actually
And you only have

If I could turn my attention now to CD1,

19

which is an issue -- which is a case that is more like

20

the Virginia districts in the sense that here it is, it

21

is the avowed use of race in order to preserve a

22

majority-minority district.

23

Now, as to this one in particular, we think

24

that the district court erred in applying strict

25

scrutiny simply based on essentially the adoption of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

BVAP floor of 50.1 percent.

2

affirm is probably to do what the North Carolina Supreme

3

Court did in the parallel State litigation, which it

4

also confronted a district court that applied strict

5

scrutiny because a BVAP floor was applied.

6

lower court there had said, but applying strict

7

scrutiny, we think this is narrowly tailored.

8
9

But the easiest way to

But the

The North Carolina Supreme Court said, you
know, the district court screwed up on finding strict

10

scrutiny triggered, but nevertheless, we agree this is

11

narrowly tailored.

12

thing here, obviously if you're reversing the district

13

court on the legal judgment about narrow tailoring, but

14

it may be the easiest way to decide CD1.

15

And I think you could do the same

Because here, the map drawers -- of course,

16

they admitted they took race into account, but they were

17

dealing with a difficult problem, which is they had a

18

benchmark map that had CD1 as a majority-minority

19

district.

Now it was -- to be sure, it was a coalition

20

district.

It was at about 48 -- a little bit north of

21

48 percent BVAP, but it had also lost 97,000 votes.

22

so they want to preserve it as a majority-minority

23

district.

24
25

Based on their reading of Strickland and
some other things, they say, you know, the safest way

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

for us to do this is to get it over 50.01 percent.

2

we're going to tell the map drawer that we want this

3

over 50.01 percent.

4

instruction and draws a district that ends up at about

5

52.6 percent.

So

The map drawer gets that

6

Now, the very fact that it's at 52 and not

7

50.1 shows that it's not like this ratio was preserved

8

over everything else, but also I think it's worth in

9

this case in particular to understand it's not like

10

there's a myriad ways to do what the map drawer did in

11

this situation.

12

There are really two opportunities.

You could either draw the district to get

13

part of Wake County, and that would get you over

14

50 percent, or you could go into the city of Durham and

15

get over 50 percent that way.

16

drawer drew the map, he drew it in Wake County; got to

17

50 percent that way.

18

Representative Butterfield and the like, and they

19

decided, you know, okay, we'll do the Durham County.

20

The first time the map

There was some back-and-forth with

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

To what extent and what

21

circumstances does Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act

22

require that a contiguous district be drawn in order to

23

comply with strict scrutiny?

24

race and then you have to comply with strict scrutiny.

25

To what extent do you think the VRA requires a compact

Assume that you're using

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

or contiguous district?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it requires a

3

reasonably contiguous district.

4

this is a situation where, you know, this was -- you had

5

a -- you had a more compact district.

6

get either Wake County or Durham, you'd essentially have

7

to extend the district to capture those territories.

8

The one thing I'd say before I sit down,

9

And I think -- I mean,

And in order to

additional thing I'd say before I sit down about CD1 is

10

I think very telling to look at Representative

11

Butterfield's testimony in the record here, because what

12

the lower court found is that the reason that we lost on

13

strict scrutiny was there was not racially polarized

14

voting in CD1, or more particularly, the State hadn't

15

done enough to show that.

16

Now, nobody thinks that there isn't racially

17

polarized voting in CD1.

18

think we didn't do enough to prove it, but they don't

19

think.

20

and he was the incumbent in that district.

21

They don't think that.

They

Representative Butterfield doesn't think that,

The dispute is not over whether there's

22

racially polarized voting.

23

know, as -- as Representative Butterfield testified,

24

it's -- it's -- it's got to be at least 45 percent.

25

or 47 is probably better.

It's whether, well, you

It couldn't go south of

Alderson Reporting Company

46

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

45 percent.

2

Representative Butterfield says that fully

3

two-thirds of white voters will never vote for a

4

African-American candidate in CD1.

5

racially polarized voting.

6

So he admits this

So all this comes down to, it's not about

7

whether we like racial targets or we don't like racial

8

targets.

9

legislature the flexibility to choose between 47 or 48,

It's whether you're going to give the

10

on the one hand, or 50.1 or 52, on the other.

11

deference to legislature means anything that has to be

12

within the deference -- the -- the zone of deference.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

18

MR. ELIAS:

19

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

21

Feel like I never left.

Court:
I'd like to actually jump in and just go

22

through District 12, as -- as my colleague did, and then

23

talk about CD1.

24
25

The problem that the State has in CD12 is
that the finding of predominance was more than amply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

supported by the record that the trial court found, and

2

we are under a clear error standard.

3

The question as, Justice Breyer, you -- you

4

pointed out is whether race was a dominant and

5

controlling factor in moving a significant number of

6

voters in or out.

7

that the -- that the State has, in trying to overturn

8

the decision of the lower court, is that an alternative

9

map was not introduced.

10

And it seems that the primary defense

While certainly an alternative map is a way

11

to adduce evidence, it can't be that it's the only way

12

to adduce evidence.

13

prove that race predominated.

14

offered no alternative map in the last case.

15

point out that we offered no alternative map in

Well, why not?

Because in each of these cases,

and in Alabama, they offered no alternative map.

21

each of these cases, there was no need to provide an

alternative map to prove circumstantially what amply

23

existed directly.

24

Alabama, in that case, or the State of Virginia, in this

25

case, did not assert political motives as a defense to

In

It is not true that the State of

2

I actually --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did they -- did they in

4

go back to Cromartie II, I think he's right.

5

say that at least where the evidence is close, where

6

it's a close question, where one side is saying it's

7

racial, the other side is saying it's political, then it

says the party attacking the legislature's boundaries

9

has to show that the legislature could have achieved its

10

legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that

11

are equally consistent with traditional principles.

Explain why isn't -- not a

7

map, but some kind of -- of evidence that they could

8

have achieved their political objectives with less

reliance on race.

That's what it seems to say.

MR. ELIAS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

many things you might say.

answer.

15

say, it doesn't matter because we have a -- a -- giving

weight to the district court doesn't matter, isn't that

important.

not.

You could say -- I mean, there are

I want to know what you do say.

MR. ELIAS:

22

Or you could

But I don't want to suggest something.

19

21

I'm not suggesting the

I'm

Your -- Your -I want to hear what you

think.
MR. ELIAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that

23

Cromartie -- the language in Cromartie that is being

24

focused on is discussing the -- the -- that case, the

25

case in which, as you say, there were lots of maps.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

That was a -- fundamentally a maps case, where there --

2

where each side is proving their case through maps,

3

principally through circumstantial evidence of what was

4

in various versions of maps.

5

In that case, where we're offering a lot of

6

maps on both sides, you at least have to offer one that

7

shows you -- you achieved the -- the goals, the

8

political goals, without -- without -- without race

9

predominating.

10

I would point out as a -- as an important

11

footnote, the State -- on remand, the State of North

12

Carolina actually did draw a remedial map in this case.

13

So it's not a hypothetical whether they could draw a map

14

that achieved their political goals that did not

15

gerrymander based on race, because, in fact, the State

16

of North Carolina, after this, drew a map of -- validly

17

on political data, not using race data, and, in fact,

18

drew this district at a lower BVAP and yet protected the

19

Republican nature of the district.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Did they say that that map

21

served political ends to the same degree as the map

22

that's before us?

23
24
25

MR. ELIAS:

I don't know what it -- Your

Honor -JUSTICE ALITO:

If they -- if they didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

say, then --

2

MR. ELIAS:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's --- the fact they were able

4

to draw another map doesn't -- doesn't really prove

5

anything.

6

If -- if a legislature says, this was done

7

on -- based on politics, and there's no way we could

8

have achieved our political objective without doing

9

this, they can't prove a negative.

10

So it makes sense to turn to the other side

11

and say, prove that that's wrong.

12

political ends could be served without taking -- without

13

drawing the map that was -- that was before -- that --

14

that -- that was drawn.

15

MR. ELIAS:

Prove that the

16

with the reading -- that reading and the reading that's

17

being offered, is it puts the constitutional cart before

The -- the -- the harm is in using race as

What has to be protected is voters'

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but the question is,

Was it politics, as they

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ELIAS:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Precisely, Your Honor.
So if there isn't -- if no

3

one can point to a way of achieving the political

4

objective, other than through the map that was drawn,

5

then that's evidence that politics was the reason for

6

it.

7

MR. ELIAS:

It -- Your Honor, it may be

8

evidence of it.

9

as a proxy for partisanship, which is not permissible.

But if it is, it's

Well, Your Honor, it was

All -- there was no objection to the

evidence.

And it is evidence that the trial court, in

viewing the witnesses and laying all the evidence in

front of it, credited as important evidence.

2

So I understand -- obviously, the Supreme

3

Court, you can -- you can do whatever you want, but I

4

think that the role of an appellate court is to look at

5

the triers of fact and say, look, you weighed the

credibility of this, and whether it sounded like

attenuated double hearsay or whether it sounded --

8

against all of the rest of the evidence, it sounded like

something that is believable when judging demeanor and

11

The other thing that I think is -- here,

that is -- that is overlooked is, look at what the

that politics drove the map, and yet it wound up with

4

and it's true that the State case was first.

5

MR. ELIAS:

Well, but Justice Ginsburg
What's

Well, so -- and the -- the

6

second point I would make -- I said there were two

7

points.

8

The second point I would make, Justice

9

Kennedy, is that the State case was really quite a

10

different case, in several respects.

11

First of all, the State case was

12

predominantly -- to use a word that's come up a lot, was

13

predominantly about the State lines.

14

challenging the congressional districts, but most of the

15

testimony in that case actually didn't relate to these

16

two congressional districts.

17

State districts, number one.

18

Yes, they were

It actually related to the

Number two is, there are not the findings of

19

fact in the Dixon case, the case -- the State case.

20

There are not the specific findings of fact about the

21

credibility of witnesses that are found in this opinion.

22

So this -- this -- this trial court was very meticulous

23

in laying out what facts they found most credible, what

24

they were relying upon.

25

The -- the State court action was much more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

conclusory in that regard, in part because, frankly, it

2

was dealing with a mountain of evidence around the State

3

legislative and the State Senate -- the State Senate

4

districts.

5

And then finally I would say, Your Honor,

6

there are other judicial mechanisms available to this

7

Court and to district courts generally to control --

8

to -- to handle the question of -- of multiple cases

9

moving through the system.

10

Congress made a -- a decision that in the

11

cases of statewide redistricting, there would be a

12

expedited process for cases to move up through the

13

Federal system to the Supreme Court.

14

good policy on the part of Congress or bad policy on the

15

part of Congress, it was a policy decision on the part

16

of Congress, that those -- that cases that come up out

17

of the Federal courts come from a three-judge panel on

18

direct appeal to this Court.

19

Whether that was

And the other -- the other case -- the other

20

case goes through the normal cert channel, and this

21

Court might choose to hear it; it might not to choose to

22

hear it.

But that's not an accident.

23

fortune.

That is actually a deliberate decision that

24

Congress made in structuring -- structuring the review.

25

That's not

it is also an equally well-established principle that

MR. ELIAS:

saying we should follow the rules.

2

ordinary rules, the ordinary course, which is the case

3

that is before you is the -- is the case before you, and

the findings of fact by the trial court in this case are

address is, there are circumstances, for example, in

There's no map because the map's either been deadlocked

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

I'd like to start with Congressional

4

District 12.

5

that basically everyone agrees looks terrible, and the

6

question is whether race was the predominant motive or

7

whether it was politics.

This is the serpentine district, the one

8

Now, this determination, the Court has said

9

on numerous occasions, is one that's reviewed for clear

10

error.

11

it.

12

to highlight some of the key evidence that it relied

13

upon in making credibility determinations and in finding

14

that race was the predominant motive.

15

And the district had a lot of evidence before

It went through a three-day trial.

And I just want

And that starts with Congressman Watts'

16

testimony that Rucho, who was one of the architects of

17

the plan, told him that they had to ramp up the minority

18

voting percentage in the district to over 50 percent.

19

So that's the racial target at the starting point in

20

order to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

21

And then as counsel mentioned, we have that

22

target being hit on the nose, 50.66 percent.

23

we have evidence, direct evidence, of the way that the

24

State did it.

25

said -- although he did also say, first, that he did not

And then

And that came from the mapmaker.

Alderson Reporting Company

And he

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

use -- he only used politics, did not use race, he made

2

contradictory statements and said that he did use race

3

with respect to Guilford County in that he pulled the

4

black population from Guilford County in order to comply

5

with the Voting Rights Act.

6

And I think if you looked at the record,

7

Justice Breyer, you would see exactly what you

8

anticipated, which is that the -- that the State was

9

pulling in concentrations of the black voting age

10

population.

11

that supported this inference that they really were

12

using race.

13

plaintiff's briefs and there's evidence cited in our

14

brief that shows that you really had that concentrated

15

pulling in.

16

Guilford County.

17

And the concentrations were so high that

And there's a chart in the -- the

That's how it was done with respect to

And then the last thing, and I think that

18

this is important, is that the district court made

19

credibility findings that the political motive had been

20

discredited.

21

that was there about political motive, but the district

22

court found that it just wasn't credible in light of

23

Congressman Watt's testimony, which the court credited,

24

about the target, and in light of the fact that the

25

political testimony, which was mostly put on by the

Mr. Clement is right:

Alderson Reporting Company

There is evidence

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

mapmaker, had been contradicted by the mapmaker himself

2

when he said that he used race and also contradicted by

3

the two architects of the plan, who kept trying to

4

downplay politics in their statements.

5

And so when we look at this, and

6

particularly in light of the clear error standard, you

7

have a -- a three-judge panel that went through three

8

days' worth of evidence, made credibility findings, went

9

through volumes of evidence.

And even the one judge

10

that disagreed with respect to this particular holding

11

recognized that what the majority did was reasonable,

12

referred to it as eminently reasonable, the

13

well-reasoned opinion of the majority.

14

cases, I just don't think that you can find clear error.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in those

You want us to apply

res judicata to decide this question, and you don't have

a position on what the answer is?

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I think if the Court

18

worried about the State court having some effect, that

19

it would ask there whether there was a res judicata bar.

20

And there would be three hurdles, I think, that the

21

State would have to overcome in order to prove -- in

22

order to show that there was a res judicata bar:

23

of all, whether the argument was waived.

24

addressed in the briefs.

25

First

That's

Second of all, whether the factual predicate

2

also a substantial question on that.

3

There's

And then, third, whether North Carolina law

4

uses a concept of privity that is very expansive, really

5

beyond where this Court was in the Taylor v. Sturgell

6

decision.

7

My point is not that you need to resolve

8

that or that you need to decide it a certain way.

9

just that if you're asking about, how do I -- what do I

It's

10

do with the State court decision, the way that you

11

figure out what to do is by using those principles.

12

What you don't do is simply defer to the State court

13

findings.

14

this case is here on appellate jurisdiction.

15

to decide the case before you.

16

would do something like use de novo review, because,

17

after all, Rule 52, which mandates clear error factual

findings, applies to this Court.

that is with the clear error standard with respect to

MS. SAHARSKY:

Because the State didn't give

any reason to pass strict scrutiny.

4

reason would be Section 5 that the State had, I think,

suggested, and that that wouldn't make sense because

What is your view of when

So we don't read the Court's

political motive is asserted.

14

word in a case like this one, and that was a case of

15

circumstantial evidence of race.

16

little direct evidence of race.

17

"direct" in quotes because it thought the direct

18

evidence was so insubstantial.

19

We take the Court at its

There really was very
The Court even put

20

and a correlation between race and politics.

21

you have the strong evidence of politics, little

22

evidence of race, and the correlation, then we think it

23

made sense in the context of that particular case for

24

the Court to say, particularly since the maps were put

25

in.

So when

Like, give us a -- give us an alternative that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52

really shows this.

2

But when you have a case, conversely, which

3

is a strong direct evidence of a racially predominant

4

motive, it just doesn't make sense to require the map,

5

because what the Equal Protection Clause gives you is --

6

is not having race being used for an unjustified reason.

7

It's not -- the map isn't a per se.

8

It's just an evidentiary thing that you could have or

not have.

It's just the map.

It's one type of evidence.

And -- and maybe one other thing that I

might say is that we just don't think that the Court --

we think the Court if it were adopting a map requirement

explained it in its opinion, and it would have done

rejecting the notion that it was politics, which is

13

correlated with race, then what's going to happen out

14

there to a successful effort to create majority-minority

15

districts where matters change, times change, oceans

16

rise, you know, et cetera?

17

how -- how -- do you see the problem?

interest.

And how do we keep -- how --

It's not just the States'

It's the constitutional interest in seeing

1

that minorities have representation in reality in the

2

legislatures.

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

And so what this

4

Court has done, first of all, is to ask about racial

5

predominance, the first question being, was race really

6

the predominant motive; not just one factor, but the

7

predominant motive?

8

the district court had the evidence.

9

Show us your evidence.

And here,

But then the second thing is when we get to

10

strict scrutiny, the Court has said, give us your

11

justification.

12

with the 1st Congressional District in this case, is

13

that the State was operating on an error of law, first

14

of all; and second, that it just did not provide the

15

justification.

16

Section 2 and Section 5 focus on.

17

And that's really, I think, the problem

And that's what the Voting Rights Act

It's not just -- as you said in Alabama for

18

the Court, not just picking a number out of thin air,

19

but showing us there's a problem here with --

20

potentially with respect to retrogression.

21

problem here with respect to vote dilution.

22

There's a

And with respect to the 1st Congressional

23

District in this case, there just wasn't evidence of a

24

potential problem with vote dilution, because at the

25

lower percentage, not being a majority-minority

district, the African-American community was able to

2

elect its candidate of choice, really, on a -- on a

3

sustained basis over a period of many years and by wide

4

margins, so -- and this is on page 49A of the District

5

Court's opinion -- it said, look, the State just didn't

6

make the case.

7

a mistake of law.

8
9

It also said the State was operating on

And so just getting back to your question,
you know, we -- we -- we understand that this is a

10

somewhat delicate balance, and we think that the Court

11

has attempted to balance the important interests

12

protected by the Equal Protection Clause against the

13

concern that States have and the flexibility that States

14

need by adopting these two different parts of the

15

standard racial predominance, and then the strong basis

16

in evidence for strict scrutiny.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

A few points in rebuttal.

24

First of all, it is worth recognizing that

25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

six trial court judges looked at Congressional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

District 12, and four out of the six said that politics,

2

not race, prevailed.

3

going to defer to the minority of two.

4

you can just ignore the State court decision on the

5

grounds that, well, they weren't specific enough or

6

something.

7

So it's a funny sort of law that's
I don't think

I would point you to Appendix B, 161 through

8

163, which are the relevant fact findings of the State

9

trial court, where they were unanimous in finding, among

10

other things, quote, "Dr. Hofeller constructed the 2011

11

12th Congressional District based on whole voter

12

tabulation districts in which President Obama received

13

the highest voter totals during the 2008 election."

14

The only information on the computer screen

15

used by Dr. Hofeller in selecting the VTDs for inclusion

16

the 12th District was the percentage by which President

17

Obama won or lost a particular VTD.

18

And that -- of course, that gets to the need

19

for an alternative map and the difficulty here, because

20

it's all well and good to say, well, we looked at it

21

afterwards, and they pulled in all these

22

African-Americans.

23

all as Democrats, too, because the African-Americans are

24

Democrats.

25

But guess what?

They pulled them

And if you're -- and what they could have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

done, which would have been simple enough if it were

2

true, is to draw a map that shows, actually, Hofeller is

3

a liar.

4

results, because if he had used those, he would come up

5

with a different map.

6

They didn't do that.

7

easy to do here, and they didn't do it.

8
9

He wasn't using the 2008 presidential election

That would have been easy to do.
Any alternative map would have

Now, they say they didn't do it in other
cases as well, and I think there are two reasons that

10

explain that, neither of which reflect particularly well

11

on the idea we should get rid of the map requirement.

12

One reason they didn't do it is because in

13

all of these cases, they thought that as long as they

14

could get the State to say, we had a BVAP floor of 50.1,

15

or 55 point -- percent, we've off the strict scrutiny

16

land, so we don't need a map on predominance.

17
18
19

That's actually wrong, and I think this
Court will say that's wrong.
The second reason is, most of these

20

challenges are brought by people who are at least as

21

concerned about Democratic political prospects as they

22

are about avoiding race.

23

an alternative map together is, should you actually

24

prevail, those no-good, dirty Republicans on the other

25

side could use the map and then say, well, look, you

And the problem with putting

can't really complain about that being a partisan

2

gerrymander, because it was your map.

3

So if you really want people to bring race

4

claims and not dressed-up partisan claims, make them --

5

put them to their proof.

6

alternative map that works.

7
8

Make them put together an

Now, as to Guilford County, there are
several responses here.

9

First of all, it's all well and good to say

10

they pulled in 75,000 African-Americans or hauled in all

11

these African-Americans.

12

well.

13

alternative map that showed, oh, there's a different way

14

to do Guilford County, and that would prove -- bring in

15

Democrats and not bring in African-Americans, then you'd

16

have something.

17

They were all Democrats, as

And that's why, even there, if you had an

But just the fact that they brought in a

18

bunch of African-Americans because they were trying to

19

bring in Democrats is about as interesting as the sun

20

coming up in North Carolina, because everybody agrees

21

there's about a 90 percent correlation between race and

22

partisan identity.

23

The second thing is, there's a very good

24

reason, Justice Kagan, that we didn't make a Section 5

25

defense, because this wasn't a case about Guilford
