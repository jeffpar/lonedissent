ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This Court, in 1985, clearly established in

11

its decision in Ake v. Oklahoma that a poor defendant

12

whose mental health or mental issues were a significant

13

factor in the case, is entitled to an expert, and an

14

expert independent of the prosecution, to assist in the

15

evaluation, the preparation, and the presentation of an

16

effective defense for the defendant.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose we thought that --

18

and it's not your position, I understand it -- that Ake

19

was ambiguous on this point.

20

became clear that, really, the psychiatrist ought to be

21

consulting with the defense and -- and not with the

22

prosecution.

23

And then over time, it

Would we say that the basic right was

24

clearly established, and that over time, we are simply

25

making a refinement, or if we think Ake is ambiguous --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

I know you'll disagree -- if we think Ake is ambiguous,

2

we are establishing a new right --

3

MR. BRIGHT:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

a defense psychiatrist.

6

MR. BRIGHT:

Right.
-- when we say it must be

Well, as Your Honor guessed, we

7

don't think it's ambiguous.

8

quite clear when you look --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In fact, we think it's

Sorry.

Go ahead.

I'm --

10

I'm assuming that we find it ambiguous.

11

then is that -- is -- can it be the position that this

12

is just a refinement of the right, or is it a new right?

13
14

MR. BRIGHT:

I'm asking,

Well, if you accept that it was

ambiguous, which, of course, we do not accept --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. BRIGHT:

Right.

-- but, of course, I mean, this

17

goes to some of the clearly established cases the Court

18

has looked at where it's -- does it extend a decision

19

that the -- the Court has -- has rendered, and is this

20

asking for something more.

21

this can't be anything but an independent expert,

22

because --

We would submit here, it --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

MR. BRIGHT:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why --

-- if it even goes to --- is that so,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

Mr. Bright, if -- if it's -- we're informed correctly by

2

the Respondent that on remand in Ake itself, the lower

3

courts held that due process is satisfied by the

4

assistance of a neutral psychiatrist.

5

So if it was all that clearly established,

6

it was not understood by -- in the very case that was

7

argued here, and that on remand, according to the

8

Respondent at least, the lower courts held a neutral

9

psychiatrist is good enough.

10

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, but whether or not the

11

Oklahoma court got it right or wrong when the case was

12

remanded, what -- what clearly established, we believe,

13

starts and ends with this Court, whether something is

14

clearly established.

15

And when the Court says, where it's a

16

significant factor, you have a right to an expert and

17

then goes through the things that that expert is going

18

to do to gather facts for the defense, to analyze facts

19

for the defense, to even assist in cross-examination of

20

the State's expert witness, you can't get more

21

intimately involved in the defense of the case than

22

being involved in the cross-examination of witnesses for

23

the prosecution.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're told here that

the -- that the -- the prosecution didn't have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

partisan expert either, that there was this -- everyone

2

who was appointed was a neutral expert serving the

3

court, the prosecution, and the defendant.

4

So I think, roughly, it suggests you're

5

asking for something that the prosecution didn't have,

6

didn't have an independent expert.

7

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, in -- in our case, it's

8

very much like Ake.

9

experts who testified, but all of them are State

10
11
12

experts.

I mean, there were mental health

And -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

"State experts"?

13

MR. BRIGHT:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

What do you mean by

They all worked -Provided by the

State or working for the prosecution?
MR. BRIGHT:

No.

They all worked for the

17

State hospital.

18

who -- the Lunacy Commission, which did the first

19

examination, are three doctors at the State hospital

20

that make an evaluation and then report to the court.

And so, as a result, they were people

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

were paid for work by the State --

23

MR. BRIGHT:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

So you mean they

Right.
-- as opposed to

being -- working for the prosecution for a particular

result in a given case.

2

MR. BRIGHT:

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

but had there been an issue, which there was in this

4

case, and should have been litigated, certainly the

5

State has no problem having an expert.

6

retain an expert, can retain more than one.

7

The State can

The -- the right that was given in Ake was

8

very modest.

9

the defendant can't choose the expert.

It was very modest.

It was an expert -But -- and --

10

and it's only one expert.

11

least make the adversary system work, to some extent.

12

But it is an expert to at

And I think what the Court recognized, and I

13

think this goes to what Justice Ginsburg was asking me

14

about, is that mental health today, as the Court said in

15

Ake, experts vary widely with regard to, first of all,

16

whether there is a mental illness.

17

what the effects of it are on behavior, and how it plays

18

into the legal --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Second, what it is,

Mr. Bright, even the

20

terminology that you are using, both here and in your

21

briefs, contains some ambiguity, because you keep

22

saying, well, Ake established the rights to an

23

independent expert.

24

the defense expert, or "independent" can mean

25

independent of both the prosecutor and the defense.

But "independent" can mean, really,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

And what you are saying that Ake held was

2

that it was a defense expert.

3

certainly parts of the opinion that read like that.

4

There's no question that when Ake talks about assistance

5

over and over again, it reads like a defense expert.

6

But the question is, did Ake really preclude the idea of

7

a completely independent person, independent of both the

8

State and the defense?

9

MR. BRIGHT:

But -- and there are

Well, it did, because of the

10

way it described what the expert was to do.

11

two places where the Court said, "we hold," they said,

12

"we hold, when it is a significant factor, that the

13

defendant is entitled to an expert."

14

regard to both the guilt phase issues and with regard to

15

the penalty phase issues.

16

And in the

That is with

So I think the Court -- and then the

17

Court isn't -- this is not one of these cases that has,

18

at least in my opinion, a lot of ambiguity, because the

19

Court could not have been more detailed or specific

20

about what that expert was going to do.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So we get --

Suppose you have a single,

22

court-appointed expert, and let's assume he's not paid

23

by the State; he or she is an outside expert.

24

expert, ethically, under the ethical rules that apply to

25

psychiatrists, meet just with the defense and say, now,

Alderson Reporting Company

Can that

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

you should be sure to do this, and then go meet just

2

with the prosecution, or do both parties have to be

3

present?

4

are in this regard?

5

wasn't quite clear on this.

6

Do -- do you know what their ethical duties
I read the article by Dr. Stone and

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, I think the ethical duty

7

is that you can't work both sides of the street in that

8

way.

9

unless you just want the opinion of the expert.

It's hard to imagine how that could ever work,
But

10

once -- what happens so often with people who start out

11

as neutral experts, is they become experts for one side

12

or the other, usually the prosecution.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. BRIGHT:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you say --

So --- in your -- in

16

your reply brief in -- on page 1, you've got four

17

examples where you say the language clearly shows that

18

they were meant -- meant to be -- I don't know what the

19

word is, but you hope it's not partisan or nonobjective,

20

but aligned experts, I guess.

21

are supposed to provide assistance that may well be

22

crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his

23

defense.

24
25

And the first one, they

Well, you can certainly understand the
assistance being here is the diagnosis, this is what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

these medical terms mean, this is what the, you know,

2

rules are or this is -- you know, it doesn't necessarily

3

mean that they are going to be partisan in helping shape

4

the defense.

5

The other one -- another one of the four you

6

say is that they're needed to translate a medical

7

diagnosis into language that will assist the trier of

8

fact.

Well, that doesn't entail partisanship of any

9

kind.

It -- it's simply sort of a medical instruction.

10

You know, this particular term means this, and then the

11

lawyer can go off and develop her defense.

12

MR. BRIGHT:

But I don't think you can take

13

each one in isolation.

14

things that the Court talked about.

15

this person gathering information, organizing

16

information, meeting with the defense about how this can

17

be used in the defense of the case, choosing among

18

viable defenses.

19

said, talking to the lawyers about how you cross-examine

20

the prosecution's expert.

21

You have to look at all the
It talked about

It even talks about the person, as I

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Bright, that is the

22

essence of this.

23

about independent, neutral, defense expert, but really

24

what's at issue is what kind of aid a defendant is

25

entitled to to mount a viable defense, correct?

Another -- there is a lot of talk

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

MR. BRIGHT:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
And so once there is

3

evidence -- and here, there was evidence at the last

4

moment -- that, in fact, as the prior experts have

5

testified that certain tests should be taken, that

6

certain signs of organic brain injury were present, once

7

that was confirmed, what the expert was saying to the

8

Court is now I need help.

9

MR. BRIGHT:

10

Right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because this expert

11

is -- this court-appointed expert is telling us that all

12

these things really are irrelevant to my defense, but I

13

have a viable claim that organic brain injury exists,

14

and that it might have an effect and provide me with a

15

defense.

16

correct?

So I need assistance in determining that,

17

MR. BRIGHT:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.
In what other area do we

19

permit the State or a court to appoint -- to not fund an

20

expert once there is viable evidence of a potential

21

defense?

22

MR. BRIGHT:

23

You mean with regard to mental health?

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. BRIGHT:

I -- I don't know of any.

In the -- in any area.

I mean, you look at Ford v.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

Wainwright, where the Court looked at the question of

2

whether someone was competent to be executed or not, and

3

the Court found that there, the -- for the process to

4

work, you couldn't have what Florida had, which was just

5

accept information from the State's doctors and not

6

accept information from the defendant's doctors.

7

And, of course, this Court found in Panetti

8

v. Quarterman that that was a clearly established rule,

9

what was in Justice Powell's concurring opinion was a

10

clearly established rule about the procedures that were

11

to be involved with regard to whether or not a person is

12

competent to be executed.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

you've answered Justice Kennedy's question.

15

with the observation that there is an argument.

16

know -- we know you don't accept it, you don't have to

17

keep saying that -- that Ake was ambiguous.

18

Now, I'm not sure that
He started
I

If it was, what happens to your case?

How

19

do you win?

20

sufficiently clearly established at the time of this

21

case so that it was an unreasonable application of law

22

by the court below?

23

How do you get to the point that this was

MR. BRIGHT:

I -- I think to prevail under

24

2254(d), we have to show that there was a violation of a

25

clearly established -- of a -- a Federal rule or a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

constitutional rule that was clearly established by

2

decision of this Court.

3

what we have to show, and Ake is what we have to show

4

for that.

So I think that's what our --

And I want to say this --

Mr. Bright, before

you move on to that, you say it's clear.

most cited treatise in this Court, certainly one of

12

point, thus, leaving the issue open for future

13

"Ake -- Ake appears to have

So your position has to be that the LaFave

15

20

for Professor LaFave, but just like lower courts,

21

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they do, but

23

your position has to be that LaFave made a mistake, the

24

Fifth Circuit made a mistake, eight State courts -- the

25

final State courts made mistakes, the -- on remand in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Ake, it was a mistake.

2

saying whether you're right or wrong on the merits, but

3

that body of authority that takes a different position

4

would seem to me to establish that the question was

5

ambiguous, at least coming out of Ake, as opposed to

6

clearly established.

7

MR. BRIGHT:

All of those things -- not

Well, I think whether a

8

proposition is clearly established begins and ends with

9

this Court.

I think the ultimate question of whether it

10

was clearly established -- yes, this has been 30 years

11

since Ake was decided.

12

to be lawyers and judges, being what they are, there are

13

going to be differences.

14

weight of the authority is certainly on our side --

So, of course, there are going

JUSTICE ALITO:

As I understand your

19

position -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- you

20

seem to be arguing that what the defendant is entitled

21

to is an expert who will function, more or less, like

22

the kind of expert who would be retained by the defense,

23

anything like that capacity for a defendant.

22

thing that is perfectly clear from the opinion in Ake,

23

is that the court would pick the expert, and it's one --

24

the court will pick one expert and that's it; the

25

defense has to live with it.

I don't see how an expert who is chosen by the

kind of an expert can ever function like an expert

retained by the defense.

4

MR. BRIGHT:

5

court-appointed lawyer.

6

Well, it's no different than a
I mean --

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is different from a

7

lawyer, because a lawyer -- you know, a lawyer doesn't

8

have to believe in the client's innocence.

9

has a professional duty, within the bounds of -- of

The lawyer

10

professional responsibility, to do everything that can

5

to ask an expert that's been provided to the defense to

do that?

7

MR. BRIGHT:

MR. BRIGHT:

I -- I think that's what

And I think --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. BRIGHT:

Not lawyers, experts.

Yeah, and experts.

I think we

14

ask the expert to look at whatever information the

15

expert has gathered, look at the defendant, examine the

16

defendant, all those sorts of things.

17

you're looking for, hopefully, a favorable opinion, but

18

that's not always going to be the case.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And, of course,

Well, no, I understand.

20

That really wasn't my question.

21

could ask the expert, you know, give me the -- give me

22

whatever is most favorable, give me advice that is most

23

favorable to my client.

24

giving an opinion about whether the individual is sane

25

or -- or something that's relevant to mitigation, I

I -- of course you

But when it comes down to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

don't see how you can ask the expert to do anything

2

other than to give the expert's honest professional

3

opinion.

4

So it doesn't -- it's -- I'm having

5

difficulty seeing how an expert who is appointed by the

6

court -- you get one -- could ever function that way.

7

And I -- I read the oral argument transcript in this

8

case, and there are several places in the oral argument

9

transcript when -- where the court and the attorney for

10

Ake equates an -- an expert who is appointed by the

11

court with a neutral expert.

12

that kind of an expert would be, a neutral expert, not

13

an expert who is really part of the defense team.

14

MR. BRIGHT:

And that seems to be what

But -- but the -- the expert

15

described in the Ake opinion, Justice Alito, is someone

16

who is a part of the defense team.

17

I mean, this question of partisan came up,

18

of using the word "partisan."

19

whether it be the prosecution, whether it be a wealthy

20

criminal defendant, whether it be a wealthy civil

21

litigant, are all going to hire partisan experts.

22

They're going to hire the experts that they think will

23

give them the opinion that will help their side of the

case.

He said,

Yeah.

Well, did he or

Yes or no.
MR. BRIGHT:

Well, what he did, and you can

19

look at what John Bivens, one of the lawyers said, right

20

towards the end -- it was in the Joint Appendix at about

21

207 -- where he made a long plea, you can almost see him

22

on bended knee reading this, in which he said, we've

23

received these records, which show he's on psychotropic

drugs.

these terms mean or what it's about.

saying, that is why we renew the motion for a

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where, somewhere else, does

it become apparent that he wants the State to appoint an

expert?

Where?

I just want to know where.

21

entitled to any more.

22

The State argues he got everything he's
He's not

The argument for -- on behalf of

23

Mr. McWilliams was that he was entitled to an

24

independent expert.

25

And the court of criminal appeals, when it

Alderson Reporting Company

decided the case, said all he was entitled to was the

2

expert that he had or no expert at all, but to have

3

these State experts examine him.

4

So that issue is crisply and clearly

5

presented there.

6

It's presented in the court of appeals.

7

has looked at this on the question of whether he was

entitled to an independent expert or not.

It's presented in the district court.

-- because -So you say that there's

13

always a conflict of interest unless the psychiatrist

works for the defending -- for the defense only.

15

MR. BRIGHT:

No.

Not necessarily a conflict

16

of interest.

17

really -- the adversary system.

18

making it possible for the defendant to present his case

19

within the adversary system.

20

He doesn't get a partisan expert.

21

choose the expert, but he gets a competent expert to

22

give whatever advice that expert can give to him as he

23

prepares his defense and as he prepares to deal with the

24

prosecution case.

25

But what Ake stands for is two things,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Court talks about

It's a minimal ability.
He doesn't get to

Mr. Bright, can I ask you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

for your interpretation of -- there are two paragraphs

2

on page 85 which talk about Smith v. Baldi, which was a

3

case --

4

MR. BRIGHT:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
-- where there was, in fact,

6

a neutral expert.

7

about why it doesn't have to pay attention to Smith v.

8

Baldi.

9

of these paragraphs are, because -- well, I'll just

10

And -- and -- and the court talks

I'm just curious as to what your interpretation

leave it like that.

11

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, I think it was giving

12

Baldi -- Smith v. Baldi a respectable burial is what it

13

boils down to, because the court says we're in

14

fundamental disagreement and points out that Baldi is a

15

case that comes from 1953.

16

decided, there wasn't even a right to counsel for -- for

17

defendants.

and other variables and, therefore, it's -- it's not --

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if I might just

finish, and then you can tell me where I've gone off the

rails.

15

Where's the stopping point?

Is it just

17

in other kinds of medicine, perhaps?

18

Where is the stopping point that you would advocate for

the Court?

20
21

Would we also have to apply the same rule

Well, I wouldn't advocate it

because it's not before the Court in this case.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And --

But it would be something

23

we'd have -- an implication we would clearly have to

24

consider.

25

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, but -- but the thing that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

the Court has to consider here is the unique nature of

mental health and the fact that experts widely disagree

on mental health.

everything.

That's why --

MR. BRIGHT:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. BRIGHT:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

Experts widely disagree on

And that --- you hire them.

And that may mean -And why they cost so very

much.
MR. BRIGHT:

And -- and many courts, State

12

courts, other courts, have said and, of course, under

13

the Criminal Justice Act in the Federal courts, that

14

where there are other issues, there may be other experts

15

as a due process question --

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's -- that's my other

17

question, is if due process requires a partisan expert,

18

surely it would also require a partisan lawyer, in which

19

case what does the Sixth Amendment do?

20

guarantee the -- the right of effective assistance of

21

counsel, it's just superfluous?

22

MR. BRIGHT:

Does it

No, the Sixth Amendment

23

guarantees a lawyer who will carry out their

24

professional responsibilities in an ethical and legal

25

way as they should.

And by the same token, an expert

the professional boundaries of -- of the profession, of

the mental health profession.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10
11
12
13
14

GENERAL BRASHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Ake did not hold that a neutral expert fails
to satisfy the Due Process Clause.
Let me talk about the psychiatric assistance

15

that was provided in this case, because I think it's

16

important to begin there.

17

case even started, the defendant made a motion for a

18

full psychiatric evaluation, specific to mitigating

19

circumstances that he was then going to want to put at

20

issue at the penalty phase of the case.

21

evaluated for over a month by three psychiatrists and a

22

psychologist for that purpose, for developing mitigating

23

circumstances.

24
25

So before the trial of this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And he was

I'm sorry.

I thought

that the three psychiatrists were part of the Lunacy

Committee.

2
3

GENERAL BRASHER:

That's correct, Your

Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I thought that the

5

purpose of the Lunacy Committee was to see if he was

6

mentally competent or not.

7

GENERAL BRASHER:

That's incorrect, Your

8

Honor.

9

the defendant expressly asked for an evaluation with

The -- the first motion that was presented by

10

respect to mitigating circumstances, and the Lunacy

11

Commission report also addressed that issue of

12

mitigating circumstances.

13
14
15

But the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did that report suggests

that further tests had to be taken with respect to that?
GENERAL BRASHER:

No, Your Honor.

That

16

report suggested that there were no mitigating

17

circumstances on the facts of the -- of the case.

18

Then after the penalty phase, the defendant

19

asked for more psychiatric assistance.

20

motion for a full neuropsychological evaluation,

21

including a specific series of psychological tests.

22

that motion was also granted.

23

on the same day it was filed, September 3rd, 1986, which

24

was just a year or so after this Court had decided Ake.

25

And then two experts did that.

They filed a

And

That motion was granted

There was an expert --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sorry, General, but if we

2

could just focus on -- because I think it would help to

3

just sort of -- let's assume for the moment that this

4

defendant did not get what he was asking for, which was

5

a defense expert, and say whether Ake entitled him to

6

such an expert.

7

And I just want to sort of focus on the

8

money sentence in Ake, you know, what -- the "we

9

therefore hold" sentence.

And it says -- here's what we

10

hold.

11

preliminary showing that mental health is going to be at

13

competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation,

15

in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the

16

defense.

17

smart people, and we can read any words, we can have an

18

argument that any words mean anything we say, still,

19

"assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of

20

the defense," doesn't that mean, like, you know, that's

21

what you -- that's the phrase you would use for a

22

counsel, to assist in evaluation, preparation, and

23

presentation of the defense.

24

defendant's side.

25

"We hold that when the defendant makes this

So assist

And, you know, recognizing that we're all

GENERAL BRASHER:

It means somebody on the

Well, if I can answer that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

with two points, Your Honor.

2

neutral experts are capable of -- of assisting the

3

defense in a way that an expert assists the defense.

4

expert --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The first is that I think

An

Well, they're capable in the

6

sense that sometimes they might, but it's not what you

7

would -- this is -- I -- I guess I'm repeating myself,

8

but this is the language that you use when you're

9

talking about, not somebody who sometimes might, and is

10

capable of, but who, in fact, will do so, to the best of

11

his ability, assist the defendant.

12

GENERAL BRASHER:

And -- and I think the way

13

an expert assists the defendant is by translating a

14

medical diagnosis into language that lawyers can

15

understand.

16

psychiatrists gather facts and offer opinions.

17

would submit that a psychiatrist who does what you ask

18

them to do, who does the evaluations that you ask them

19

to do, prepares the reports that you ask them to

20

prepare, they're assisting your defense, just like they

21

did in this case --

22

The -- the Court says in Ake that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we

But the word

23

"assistance," you know, we use it -- we use it most

24

often is, the defendant is entitled to the assistance of

25

counsel.

Assistance of counsel doesn't mean neutral.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

And this -- the one thing that stands out in this case

2

is the word assist the defense, assisting, adversarial.

3

The -- those at least are clues that what the decision

4

writer had in mind was assisting the defense, just as a

5

lawyer assists the defense.

6

GENERAL BRASHER:

Well, if I could just

7

respond to that, Justice Ginsburg.

8

has to evaluate the holding of Ake, in light of the

9

facts and the question presented in Ake, right?

I think the Court

This

10

isn't a statute that we're interpreting, it's a judicial

11

decision.

12

a neutral expert that had assisted the defendant.

13

problem in Ake was that there was no expert that had

14

assisted the defendant at all --

15

And the problem in Ake was not that there was

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

But sometimes the Court goes

16

beyond what the facts are, and sometimes -- you know,

17

sometimes it issues a holding that's just precisely

18

calibrated to the facts, and sometimes broader.

19

and it seems that what we do is we look at the language,

20

we look at what the Court said, and said given what the

21

Court said, is this right clearly established.

22

And --

And I guess, again, just to repeat what

23

Justice Ginsburg said, I started counting up the word

24

"assist" in this opinion and, frankly, I lost track.

25

That every time this opinion talks about this, it talks

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

about assisting the defense and assisting the defendant,

2

including to cross-examine the prosecution.

3

seems that the premise of the entire opinion is you're

4

on the defense team.

5

GENERAL BRASHER:

It just

Well, there are -- there

6

are parts of the opinion that we would suggest that also

7

cut in our favor.

8

discussion of Baldi, I think, cuts in our favor, because

9

the Court does distinguish Baldi on the grounds that

So, for example, the Court's

10

neutral experts testified in that case.

11

case where this Court affirmed --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Baldi was a

Well, at first it does,

13

you're exactly right.

14

Baldi.

15

confusing, because the first paragraph says, we're

16

distinguishing it because there it was a neutral expert.

17

And then the second paragraph says, anyhow, Baldi -- I

18

mean, it does -- it doesn't use the term overall, but a

19

lower court would be crazed if it relied on Baldi after

20

that opinion.

21

And this is why I asked about

I find those two paragraphs incredibly

GENERAL BRASHER:

Well, I'll count

22

"incredibly confusing" as a plus for me in a Federal

23

habeas case, where the law has to --

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, no, no.

Two paragraphs

might be confusing, but the question is, what does the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

opinion say, and particularly, what does the holding

2

say?

3

GENERAL BRASHER:

Right.

And -- and the

4

other part of the opinion that we think counts in -- in

5

our favor is the part where the Court says, in the

6

paragraph that has this holding in it, that we're going

7

to leave it to the States to decide how to implement

8

this right.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I saw it, but what about

10

the point that Justice Kagan raised.

22

the court previously said that that person, the object

23

is, is the insanity defense viable, present testimony to

24

that effect, assist in preparing the cross-examination

25

of a State psychiatric witness.

And in case we're unclear what that means,

So if I could just

address that, Justice Breyer.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would you -- would you

object to the following disposition of the case:

we say the issue is not partisan versus independent.

The issue is whether the defense had assistance from a

psychiatrist in the evaluation, preparation, and

GENERAL BRASHER:

caveat, which is that this is a Federal habeas case, so

2

the question would be whether the State courts

If they did not give the --

applied the law.

question on which we granted cert was whether somebody

second question presented in the cert petition.

4

Breyer's question was the second question that the Court

5

didn't grant cert on.

6

And my point was that that was the
Justice

To talk about the question that the Court

7

did grant cert on, I do think it's important that this

8

issue wasn't presented in Ake because this is a Federal

9

habeas case, and this is the first time that anyone

10

representing a State or the Federal government has been

11

able to stand here and argue that a neutral expert

12

actually does satisfy the Due Process Clause.

13

And we would submit that the way Federal

14

habeas is supposed to work in this area is that the

15

States sort of get a first shot at the -- the Supreme

16

Court to -- to argue our position.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there -- is there any

18

jurisdiction that holds that today, that all that Ake

19

requires is a neutral expert?

20

jurisdiction recognizes that Ake requires an expert who

21

will be, essentially, part of the defense team.

22

GENERAL BRASHER:

I thought by now every

Well, this issue really

23

has been mooted over the last 30-some-odd years because

24

of statutory changes.

25

jurisdictions that have reversed their previous cases

So there are -- there are

Including -- including

3

Alabama, am I right, that in 2005, the Alabama Court of

4

Criminal Appeals said Ake made it clear that an indigent

5

defendant is entitled to an independent expert devoted

6

to assisting his defense, not one providing the same

7

information or advice to the court and prosecution.

8
9

GENERAL BRASHER:

That's correct.

But what

we would submit is what these lower courts are doing is

10

they are extending this Court's precedent to address

11

this question.

12

here because this is not a direct appeal case.

13

question in this case is not whether Ake should be

14

extended to say that a -- a neutral expert doesn't

15

satisfy the Due Process Clause.

16

case is whether Ake held that.

17

Ake says nothing about independent --

18

And we don't have to really address this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

The question in this
And we would submit that

Well, if Ake says that you

19

have a right to meaningful assistance from a -- from a

20

psychiatrist, you, the defense, and then over time it

21

becomes clear to us that that psychiatrist must be --

22

must -- must be retained for the benefit of the defense

23

only, is that a new clearly established holding, or is

24

it simply a refinement of a clearly established right

25

that was set forth in Ake?

Official - Subject to Final Review

42
1

The -- the Petitioner's counsel didn't seem

2

to want to embrace that.

3

impression that if it's ambiguous, he loses, but I'm not

4

sure that's the case.

5

So then if -- gave us the

GENERAL BRASHER:

Well, I think the reason

6

my -- my friend didn't want to embrace that is because

7

when you use the word "refinement," I think what you're

8

suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is extension.

9

Court has said that you can't extend a precedent in the

And this

10

context of Federal habeas.

11

friend is suggesting, is that this Court should extend

12

the actual holding of Ake to embrace this new right that

13

says that a neutral expert is insufficient.

14
15

And that really is what my

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
said that?

What was the case where we

I think you're right.

in White v. Woodall, the Court said that.

The Court said -- is that

I should also point out that there's --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But again, General, I mean,

20

the actual holding of Ake calls for assistance in

21

evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the

22

defense.

23

about how we used to think that psychiatric opinions

24

were just like one thing, but now we know better.

25

know that different psychiatrists have different

opinions, and it's really important to arm even an

2

indigent defendant with the tools that he needs to come

3

back at the State and to say -- and to say -- and to

4

establish what he wants to establish about his mental

5

health.

6

I mean, that's really the theme of the

7

opinion, that you have to give the indigent defendants,

8

just as you give the wealthier defendant, the tools that

9

they need to establish what they want to establish about

10

mental health.

11

with these words that are repeated in the holding and

12

elsewhere.

13

And then that's consistent with the --

GENERAL BRASHER:

Well, to go to the issue

14

of wealthy and indigence, this Court did say, in a

15

footnote, that it was reserving that question.

16

not talking about the Equal Protection Clause.

recognize that if you had money you would have experts,

that people can have different opinions about, and that

him in these ways, in evaluating, preparing, and

4

GENERAL BRASHER:

And our point, Justice

5

Kagan, is just that this question presented in this

6

case, which is about whether a neutral expert can

7

satisfy that, was not at issue in Ake --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

well, here, what about this.

It seemed in the defense -Are you saying this?

"The

11

from the psychiatrist who acts independently of the

12

That's, I think, what you're

14

I mean, it's a trick question.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

Because, of course, I'm

quoting from the dissent.

18

GENERAL BRASHER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
And what the dissent says

20

is that is precisely what the Court doesn't hold.

21

wish they would.

22

We all have.

23

isn't what the Court holds, that's at least some

24

evidence that that wasn't what the Court held.

25

And I

I've written dissents like that, too.

But if it's a dissent and you say that

GENERAL BRASHER:

Well, Justice Rehnquist --

Chief Justice's concurrence in that case, which took a

11

very limited view of Ake.

12

And ultimately, the way you interpret what

13

is clearly established under one of this Court's

14

holdings is you look at the facts of the case and you

15

look at the question presented, and there's just no

16

dispute that on the facts of Ake, the problem was that

17

he did not get any expert assistance at all --

GENERAL BRASHER:

Well, with respect,

Justice Kagan, this is what the Court said in Lopez

about how you evaluate this issue.

5

quote, "the specific question presented," end quote, in

6

the case, and you see whether it's come up again.

7

The Court said,

And so the specific question presented here

8

is about whether a neutral expert can satisfy the Due

9

Process Clause.

10

That wasn't presented in Ake.

And just to be clear, in Ake, there was a

11

motion filed for a psychiatric evaluation for sanity at

12

the time of the defense, and that motion was denied.

13

The -- the motion that was filed here for a

14

psychiatric evaluation for mitigating circumstances, the

15

two motions, both before trial and the full

psychological evaluation after the penalty phase, both

were granted.

case you presented as -- as -- the defense is asking for

a defense-oriented expert.

14

no such expert for the State.

15

itself says that:

16

17

psychiatrists who had testified at the guilt phase, that

18

he was dangerous to society.

And you said that there was

Before the sentencing judge, the

19

So the judge -- before the judge imposed the

20

sentence, is looking back to the guilt phase where there

21

were experts for the State, not independent, whatever,

22

they were called by the prosecutor to testify to future

23

dangerousness.

24
25

GENERAL BRASHER:

Just to be clear, Justice

Ginsburg, are you talking about the facts of Ake, or the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

49

facts of this case?

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
facts of Ake.

4
5

I'm talking about the

GENERAL BRASHER:

Right.

Yes, Justice

Ginsburg.

6

So -- so in that case, one of the issues at

7

capital sentencing was that the State actually put the

8

defendant's mental health at issue as an aggravating

9

circumstance.

So this Court knows that the way capital

10

punishment works is it's the State's burden to prove an

11

aggravating circumstance, and if State doesn't meet that

12

burden, then the defendant isn't eligible for the death

13

penalty.

14

And in Ake, the problem was that the -- is

15

that the State used psychiatric testimony to meet its

16

burden to make the defendant eligible for the death

17

penalty, and the defendant didn't have any -- any way to

18

rebut that, because the defendant's motion had been

19

denied.

20

Here, once again, the defendant was trying

21

to put his mental health at issue.

22

raise it as a mitigating circumstance.

23

issue of future dangerousness in this case, because the

24

aggravating circumstances that made Mr. McWilliams

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I'm not asking about

2

that particular issue, but I thought that the sentencing

3

judge now, after the guilt phase, is looking to the

4

testimony that was given at the guilt phase by experts

5

who were prosecution experts, not neutral experts.

6
7

GENERAL BRASHER:

I'm so sorry.

Is that

in -- is your question about Ake?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

9

GENERAL BRASHER:

Okay.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

GENERAL BRASHER:

This is all in Ake.
Yes.

So -- so they were

12

not prosecution experts; they were experts that were --

13

that had evaluated the defendant for competency to stand

14

trial.

15

done for the defendant's sanity at the time of the

16

offense.

17

was the issue that the defendant wanted to raise.

18

issue wanted to raise his mental health with respect to

19

his sanity at the time of the offense.

20

motion was denied, although Mr. McWilliams's motion was

21

granted, in Ake, his motion was denied, and he couldn't

22

put that issue in front of the court.

23

They -- there -- there was no evaluation ever

And that was a key fact in Ake, because that
The

And because his

Here, the -- the motion was granted, so he

24

was allowed to put that issue in front of the court.

25

had a full neuropsychological evaluation, and the judge

Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official - Subject to Final Review

51
1

at sentencing looked at that report as part of his

2

evaluation.

3

I just wanted to mention one thing that goes

4

back to the timing issue, which is this argument from my

5

friend that there was some kind of sandbagging with

6

respect to these records from the department of --

7

Department of Health.

8

suggested was relevant in those records was the specific

9

prescriptions that the -- Mr. McWilliams was -- was

The only thing that he has ever

10

getting at -- at the Department of Corrections.

11

lawyer for Mr. McWilliams knew about those drugs well in

12

advance of this hearing.

13

But the

If you look at page 269 of the trial

14

transcript, well in advance of trial, counsel for

15

Mr. McWilliams talks about the drugs that his client is

16

getting.

17

Actually, if you look at the Joint Appendix

18

on page 191A, you'll see that the lawyer for

19

Mr. McWilliams actually shows up to -- to the judicial

20

sentencing with articles about the specific drugs that

21

his lawyers -- I mean, that his client is being

22

prescribed.

23

the hearing.

So he knew about this well in advance of

24

And another way to evaluate this issue is

25

that on post-conviction review, you know, 20-some-odd

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

years after this conviction was -- was done,

2

Mr. McWilliams got to hire a partisan expert.

3

search the country for the best partisan expert, and he

4

hired Dr. Woods, an expert from California.

5

his analysis of this was just that Mr. McWilliams had --

6

was bipolar.

7

those records that would lead to a change in the -- in

8

the ultimate outcome here.

9

He got to

And -- and

He didn't draw anything significant out of

I mean, ultimately, this case has been

10

pending for over 30 years.

11

reason why Congress said that under Federal habeas,

12

we're going to require clearly established law at the

13

time of the State court's decision, is because we're

14

supposed to look at this not, you know, through 2017

15

eyes; we're supposed to look at this through the eyes of

16

the State court that had to evaluate this issue in 1991.

17

And -- and part of the

And that, we submit, is why the fact that

18

all these lower courts were saying that neutral experts

19

could satisfy the due process clause is important,

20

because --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

No that's true.

There have

22

been a lot of lower courts, a lot of smart judges have

23

read Ake and they found it ambiguous.

24

this may have been what went on in their minds.

25

what's -- what was going on in Ake because we have

Alderson Reporting Company

And I wonder if
We know

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

written opinions like that, and we have joined opinions

2

like that.

3

ambiguous, because there was probably disagreement among

4

the members of the majority about how far they wanted to

5

go.

This is an opinion that is deliberately

6

Do you think that's a reasonable hypothesis?

7

GENERAL BRASHER:

I think that's a very

8

reasonable hypothesis.

9

that that hypothesis has some merit is that, when this

And I think one way -- one way

10

precise issue about neutral expert versus partisan

11

experts came back up to this Court in Granville, where
