States.

Ms. Shapiro.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA A. E. SHAPIRO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In case after case -- McNally, Skilling, and

12

McDonald, to name just a few -- this Court has construed

13

Federal criminal statutes narrowly to avoid serious

14

separation of powers and vagueness problems.

15

This case presents those same constitutional

16

concerns, but to a far greater degree, because no

17

statute defines the elements of the crime.

18

should limit this crime to its core, as it did in

19

Skilling, and that core is the insider's abuse of

20

confidential corporate information for personal profit.

21

Unless and until Congress enacts a definition, the crime

22

should be limited to trading by the insider or its

23

functional equivalent -- equivalent where the insider

24

tips another person in exchange for a financial benefit.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Court

Suppose in this case the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

person with the inside -- inside information, the

2

brother with the inside information, had himself traded

3

in the securities, and then gave the proceeds to his --

4

what was it?

5

violated 10(b)?

His older brother?

6

MS. SHAPIRO:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would that have

Yes, Your Honor.
So what's the difference,

8

if the insider trades and gives it -- makes the proceeds

9

a gift, or if he just says, you do the trade; here's the

10

gift?

11

MS. SHAPIRO:

The difference, Your Honor, is

12

that the transaction -- the securities transaction is

13

complete when the insider trades.

14

that doesn't even mention insider trading, much less

15

tipping or personal benefit.

16

it wouldn't be covered, and he can do whatever he wants

17

with the money.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this is a statute

And so in that instance,

Justice Ginsburg was

19

setting up the question, isn't he -- in -- in her

20

instance where the tippee does the trading, the tippee

21

is just an accomplice.

22

stuff.

23

MS. SHAPIRO:

This is standard accomplice

No, Your Honor.

This -- the

24

statute -- this is a case where we have to take a step

25

back and look at the fact the statute doesn't define the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

elements.

2

less tipping, and the -- the -- whereas Dirks and

3

Chiarella before it make clear that not all trading on

4

inside information is unlawful.

5

unlawful is that the insider is doing it for personal

6

gain, whether trading himself and profiting on the

7

information by doing so, or whether it's by

8

circumventing that rule, as discussed in Dirks, and

9

essentially giving the information to someone else so

10
11
12
13

It doesn't even mention insider trading, much

And what makes it

that he can get a financial kickback.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's --

Maybe I'm missing --

maybe one of us is missing the import of the question.
Are -- are you suggesting that if two people

14

get together, one of them has inside information and he

15

says to the other person, why don't the two of us -- why

16

don't you trade on that, and then you and I will split

17

the proceeds, that that's not covered?

18

MS. SHAPIRO:

That is covered, Your Honor.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MS. SHAPIRO:

I'm sorry.

Oh, okay.
What I meant was

21

that if the insider -- as occurred in this case, and

22

it's undisputed in this case -- did not act for any

23

financial gain, did not make any money at all, that's

24

what's not covered.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Don't you think that his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

brother's statement -- when he was asked about trading

2

by Maher, the younger brother, he said, I owe somebody

3

money.

4

me the money to pay this person back or give me

5

information that lets me pay him back?

6

always the quid pro quo of a gift, that you believe that

7

if you give someone a gift, it's going to cost you one

8

way or another?

Isn't that most naturally read to be either give

9

Isn't that

You're going to give them something of

10

value, or you're going to substitute money for the gift,

11

or you're going to do something that saves you money by

12

giving the tip.

13

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

14

problem with that is that virtually anything would --

15

any disclosure would then amount to a gift, and this

16

Court has been crystal clear that -- that not any

17

disclosure leads to a violation --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's true, but then

19

comes the government's suggestion that the disclosure

20

has to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose,

21

that there has to be a reason you're doing it, not

22

accidentally, not -- not unknowingly, but something

23

you're doing because you want to receive some benefit

24

from it.

25

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, in this case, it's quite

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

clear that Maher, the -- the insider brother, didn't

2

receive any benefit at all, and indeed the district

3

court and the SEC made that clear.

4

for any kind of self-benefit, and I think the evidence

5

in the record, even construed in the light most

6

favorable to the government, as it must be, demonstrates

7

that at most, the insider got the scant benefit of

8

getting his brother off his back.

9

willing transfer of inside information.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. SHAPIRO:

12

He did not do this

This was not a

Why do you say "scant"?

Well, Your Honor, I think we

have to get back to the fact that this --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, my bigger question is

14

why -- why do all the disclosure forms we have to fill

15

out?

16

like, your minor children, your wife.

17

gifts, you have to disclose your minor children, your

18

wife.

They have a lot of relatives.

19

You have to put,
And in giving

I mean, why are the statute books filled

20

with instances where the public wants to know, not just

21

how you might benefit, but how your family might

22

benefit?

23
24
25

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, Your Honor, the statute

books are filled with rules like that, but Section -JUSTICE BREYER:

Because --

1

MS. SHAPIRO:

-- 10(b) --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, I realize it

3

doesn't, but I mean, I'm looking for the reason why.

4

And of course I can suggest a reason.

5

think very often, though it depends on families, to help

6

a close family member is like helping yourself.

7

not true of all families --

8

MS. SHAPIRO:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MS. SHAPIRO:

Because they

That's

Well, Your Honor --- but many, it is.

I think that the important

11

thing here is that the statute doesn't address this.

12

And Congress could certainly pass a statute --

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you think it addresses

benefits?

15

MS. SHAPIRO:

No, the statute --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, the statute

17

doesn't, but there's a long history, and the person

18

who's been defrauded, I take it, or the object of deceit

19

is the company whose information you use.

20

use their information, which you shouldn't, and tell it

21

to someone, you're hurting them.

22

subset of cases that we prosecute.

23

cases we prosecute are the cases where, having used that

24

information, you use it to benefit yourself.

25

And when you

And then there's a
And the subset of

And the question, I take it, is when you use

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it to benefit a close family member, is that, in effect,

2

benefitting yourself.

3

Jack Warner -- rule of relativity:

4

relative.

5

but you also have the view that helping a relative is

6

helping yourself.

7

Cecil B. DeMille said -- or maybe
Never hire a

You could have -- you could have that view,

Now, that seems to me where we are in this

8

case, and the law is filled with instances where they do

9

seem to think it's the same.

And there are a lot of

10

cases here that think it's about the same, so why isn't

11

it?

12

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, Your Honor, there aren't

13

a lot of cases, and the only cases that this Court has

14

decided are Chiarella, Dirks and O'Hagan.

15

in which the Court held for the government was O'Hagan,

16

and the insider was making his own profits to the tune

17

of $4 million.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The only case

Ms. Shapiro, you're asking

19

us to ignore some extremely specific language in Dirks,

20

which of course, was decided quite some time ago.

21

I'm just going read in Dirks.

22

So

The Court is talking about when it would be

23

proper under the statute to convict somebody for insider

24

trading, it's because there might be a relationship

25

between the insider and the recipient, or an intention

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

to benefit the particular recipient.

2

on to say, "When an insider makes a gift of confidential

3

information to a trading relative or friend," and then

4

in the last paragraph of the opinion, where it's really

5

summing up everything that it's done, the Court says,

6

"The tippers received no monetary or personal benefit,

7

nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable

8

information to the tippee."

9

And then it goes

So there's a lot of language in Dirks which

10

is very specific about, it's not only when there's a

11

quid pro quo from the tippee to the tipper, but when the

12

tipper makes a gift to the tippee, and in particular a

13

relative or friend.

14
15

MS. SHAPIRO:

That's right, Your Honor.

Dirks does mention gifts, but I don't think that --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

like half their holding.

18

MS. SHAPIRO:

More than mention.

This is

Well, I don't -- don't agree,

19

Your Honor.

20

the -- I believe that it's dictum, and that the holding

21

of the case is -- is far different.

22

not be used to be the basis for criminal liability when

23

we have a statute that doesn't address --

24
25

Dirks mentions gifts in two places, but

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And dictum should

I don't know what

"dictum" -- what "dictum" means.

The court is very

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

clearly setting out a test here.

2

the test.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this is part of

And it's certainly not

4

dictum in Dirks when the Court says, "Thus, the test is

5

whether the insider personally will benefit directly or

6

indirectly from his disclosure."

7

MS. SHAPIRO:

I agree with you, Justice

8

Kennedy.

And in fact, the Court goes on to then say

9

right after that, "Absent some personal gain, there has

10

been no breach of duty to stockholders."

11

personal --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

We're talking about

13

benefit and personal gain.

14

benefit in making a gift.

15

law of gifts, we don't generally talk about benefit to

16

the donor -- I can -- other than in gift tax, but that's

17

for different reasons.

18

MS. SHAPIRO:

And Dirks says there's a
Now, it's -- it's true in the

No.

In fact, the opposite.

19

In -- in most areas of the law, a gift is supposed to be

20

something that is not intended to benefit the giver.

21

And it's critical in this area, and I think the

22

Securities Industry Association brief illustrates this

23

point, but many of the other briefs do --

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Except, as Justice Breyer

points out, you certainly benefit from giving to your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

family.

2
3

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, I -- just to -- I want

to be very clear about --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It ennobles you, and in a

5

sense it -- it helps you financially because you make

6

them more secure.

7

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, I want to be very clear

8

about the test that we're proposing, because I do think

9

it's going to capture a number of these families'

10

situations.

The point is the line has to be clear,

11

whether it's family or anyone else that the disclosure

12

is being given to.

13

that we propose, certainly there will be many cases

14

where the government can introduce evidence showing the

15

kind of financial interdependence that will illustrate

16

that the insider does benefit financially from the

17

disclosure.

18

situations involving spouses, and many other situations

19

involving close relatives.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And under the pecuniary gain test

I'm sure that's going to be true in most

Ms. Shapiro, let me give you

21

a hypothetical.

Let's suppose I would like to give a

22

gift to a friend of mine, but it's just too expensive

23

for me to give it.

24

and I see a hundred dollar bill sitting there, and I

25

take the hundred dollar bill; and now I can give a gift

And then I pass a coworker's desk,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

that I had wanted to give, but I couldn't.

2
3

Now, have I benefitted from stealing the
hundred dollar bill?

4

MS. SHAPIRO:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, you have.

And why

6

should the issue be any different if, instead of

7

stealing the hundred dollar bill off my coworker's desk,

8

I instead steal information and give the gift of that

9

information rather than give a gift of cash?

10

MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, there's certainly going

11

to be some situations involving gifts that will be

12

covered.

13

once a year at Christmastime to give a household

14

employee a bonus, and one year I decide to give her a

15

tip instead, that would certainly qualify.

16

to depend on the nature of the evidence and whether

17

there's a -- a --

So for example, if I have a tradition every --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's going

I think what I'm suggesting

19

by the hypothetical is that we all have our own

20

interests and purposes behind giving gifts.

21

those might be very practical and pragmatic.

22

them might be more altruistic.

23

individual interests and purposes.

It might be, as in this case, a family

It might be a friend.

I'm using it for my own

MS. SHAPIRO:

But, Your Honor, that would be

true in virtually any instance one could think of where

10

an insider disclosed confidential corporate information,

11

whether it's in a business setting, or, as is often the

12

case, a mixed social and business setting.

13

talk to company insiders all the time, and it's

14

essential to the free flow of information to the

15

marketplace that that occurs.

16

And if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

all, that's no longer true.

18

stop that, talking to analysts.

19

Analysts

Wait a minute.

First of

There's regulations that

But talk about the culpability question.

20

Why is it any less culpable to give your close relative,

21

who you've been supporting every month for your entire

22

life, so instead of giving him, one month or two months,

23

that regular one hundred dollar bill, you choose to give

24

him corporate information.

25

example.

That's Justice Kagan's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

Why is that person more culpable than the

2

person who just -- a relative comes and says, it would

3

be nice; I need some money.

4

instead of the cash.

5

MS. SHAPIRO:

And you give him a tip

I think the issue is that

6

there has to be a clear line.

7

crime that was never defined by Congress.

8

words are in the statute.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We're dealing with a
None of these

But Congress doesn't

10

define what's deceptive or manipulative or -- what's the

11

third word? -- what defrauds.

12

Don't devise a scheme that does these things.

13

has for ages said that the failure to -- to speak when

14

you're obligated to; i.e., an insider who doesn't

15

disclose that he's using your information is an omission

16

that's been, classically, a fraud.

17
18
19

It has general words.
The law

So I don't understand why you keep saying
that the law doesn't define this.
MS. SHAPIRO:

Because, Your Honor, the law

20

says nothing about insider trading, and as the Chiarella

21

court said, the statute provides no specific guidance,

22

nor does the legislative history.

23

very similar to the honest services fraud crime, or

24

indeed, before that statute was enacted, the mail fraud

25

statute that existed before the McNally case.

Alderson Reporting Company

And any -- this is

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

The statute talked about fraud.

The honest

2

services fraud statute talked about fraud, but it

3

provided no specific guidances to what would violate.

4

And this Court held that the statute needed

5

to be construed narrowly to ensure that there was a

6

clear line.

7

and all of those laws use words like "insider" and

8

define under what circumstances a person is violating

9

the law by trading.

10

Other countries have insider trading laws,

This Court has repeatedly held that there is

11

no general duty to refrain from insider trading.

12

it's essential that the market participants understand

13

when the line is crossed and when it's not.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

I -- well -Justice Breyer.

I agree with that.

But it

17

seems to me the analogy is the antitrust laws, very

vague statute.

Exactly what's criminal and what's civil and so forth

20

has been developed by courts over a long time.

And it seems to me -- and I'm giving you a

2

chance to respond to this, that -- suddenly to take the

3

minority statute here -- or to take the Second Circuit,

4

is what I'm thinking of -- is really more likely to

5

change the law that people have come to rely upon than

6

it is to keep to it.

7

I just want to get your view on that.

8

MS. SHAPIRO:

9

Well, I don't think so, Your

Honor, and I think some of the amicus briefs illustrate

10

that there's been a tremendous amount of murkiness in

11

the Securities Industry Association.

12

has had a lot of trouble -- its members have had a lot

13

of trouble determining when they can and can't use

14

market information of this sort.

15

the way, is very clear that it does not purport to

16

change the antifraud laws.

17

provides that a violation of regulation in FD does not

18

in and of itself constitute insider trading under

20

In particular, it

And regulation FD, by

And the regulation itself

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that -- that addresses

21

whether or not there's an initial breach.

Here, we

22

assume there's an initial breach.

23

far out does liability extend?

24

what you're saying doesn't quite address the problem

25

we're discussing.

The question is:

How

And it seems to me that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

MS. SHAPIRO:

No, Justice Kennedy, I don't

2

agree with that, because what this Court has repeatedly

3

held in a number of cases going back to the Santa Fe

4

case is not every breach of fiduciary duty violates

5

Section 10(b), and it has to be a fraudulent breach.

6

And the question of whether it's a fraudulent breach

7

depends upon whether the insider is doing the disclosing

8

in exchange for personal benefit.

9

That's the test.

It's not simply whether there's any old

10

breach of fiduciary duty.

Indeed, one could argue in

11

the Dirks case that the insider there, Secrist, was

12

breaching his fiduciary duty.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If Dirks is the test, and

14

it certainly was phrased as a test and that's how Judge

15

Ray could have understood it, if it is the test, then

16

this case falls within it because it's a gift, right?

17

MS. SHAPIRO:

I don't agree with that, Your

18

Honor.

I think that the facts of this case show that --

19

there may be many family circumstances where this would

20

be a gift, but I think the facts of this case show that

21

the insider was not -- he was being pestered by his

22

brother and pressured to release the information.

23

didn't even know he was trading until later in the

24

process.

2

brother said he wouldn't.

3

Your Honor.

4

So I don't agree with that,

But I think it is essential in order for

5

there to be a clear line that the Court hold that the

6

insider must personally benefit in a concrete way unless

7

and until Congress -- if that's an under inclusive test,

8

Congress can act.

9

Congress can change the law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why isn't it a

benefit, if you said the brother was pestering him so

11

now his brother is happy?

12

pestered.

13

He's no longer being

Isn't that a benefit?
MS. SHAPIRO:

Well, if that's a benefit,

14

virtually anything is, and then the Court would be going

15

back to the rule that expressly rejected in Chiarella,

16

reaffirmed in Dirks, and even in the Omega case, that --

17

that any general duty not to refrain from -- to refrain

18

from insider trading.

exist?

15

Besides the fact it has to be a tangible benefit.

16

What other ways are

Lisser has given us one proposal.

MS. SHAPIRO:

What's yours?

I don't think there's any

17

other test that the Court could provide that wouldn't

18

essentially be a judicial expansion retroactively of a

19

statute that doesn't address the question in violation

20

of the separation of powers.

21

thing that I would like to come back to, which we talk

22

about in the briefs, is the fact that there's a very

23

analogous situation with respect to the private right of

24

action in 10(b), which was also created by the courts,

25

and this Court has repeatedly held that in that context,

I think that the other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

which is not in criminal context and does not involve a

2

risk to a person's liberty that the Court must narrowly

3

construe the statute and not expand it further, and it's

4

for Congress to decide whether to expand it further.

5

And I think that --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Shapiro, here is not a

7

question of expanding it further.

8

cut back significantly from something that we said

9

several decades ago, something that Congress has shown

10

no indication that it's unhappy with, and in a context

11

in which, I mean, obviously the integrity of the markets

12

are a very important thing for this country.

13

asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that

14

threatens that integrity.

15

MS. SHAPIRO:

You're asking us to

And you're

No, Your Honor, I don't think

16

we're asking you to change the rules.

This Court has

17

only addressed this question once.

18

gift language is -- is the holding of the case.

19

holding of the case is that the insider has to get a

20

personal gain.

21

which, again, ruled against the government, is to ensure

22

that what's captured is something that is essentially a

23

circumvention of the test the Court discussed in

24

Chiarella where the insider is improperly profiting from

25

the information.

fiduciary duty to the corporation.

He was the printer that -- he had

MS. SHAPIRO:

That's correct.

I was

8

referring to the discussion in the case about when a

9

duty would arise.

And the Court in that case held that

10

there was no duty, but that a duty would have arisen if

11

he had been an insider in the company whose shares were

12

at issue.

13

held that it would be a fraud to exploit the information

14

for his personal trading profits because he had a duty

15

to those shareholders and a duty to speak and either

16

disclose or abstain from trading.

17

And the reason for that is that the Court

With respect to the integrity of the

markets, getting back to your question, Justice Kagan, I

19

think that that is clearly a policy question, and it is

20

a very complex policy question.

21

simple as the government would like to have the Court

22

believe.

23

in our briefs and some of the amicus briefs which

24

illustrates that's there's a robust debate among

25

academics, regulators, market participants about what --

It is not one nearly as

And I think there's extensive literature cited

what should be -- whether insider trading should be

2

regulated at all, but more importantly to what extent,

3

and how do you do that while ensuring that there's

4

sufficient free flow of information to the markets that

5

this information can actually work its way into the

6

price.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I wasn't suggesting that

8

there was -- there are easy answers to the question of

9

what contributes to the integrity of the market.

I was

10

suggesting that it's a reason for caution in changing a

11

30-year-old rule that everybody has understood and lived

12

by, and that -- that Congress has shown no indication

13

it's unhappy with.

remainder of my time for rebuttal?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under a pecuniary gain limitation to the

23

personal benefit test in Dirks, a corporate insider

24

possessing very valuable nonpublic material information

25

could parcel it out to favored friends, family members

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

and acquaintances who could all use it in trading

2

without the knowledge of the public or the investors on

3

the other side of the trade.

4

to the integrity of the securities markets.

5

injure investor confidence, and it would contradict a

6

33-year-old precedent of this Court that was designed to

7

announce the circumstances in which material nonpublic

8

information possessed by an insider could not be used.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This would be deleterious
It would

Isn't it something of a

10

stretch to say that the circumstance you describe more

11

widespread on dissemination are all gifts?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

So some of them may be gifts.

13

Some of them may be to obtain a reputational benefit

14

that might translate in the future into pecuniary gain.

15

Some of them might actually involve a quid pro quo.

16

point is that under Petitioner's theory, when they are

17

gifts, in other words when the information is given out

18

to a romantic partner or to a struggling child who's

19

having difficulty making it, or as in this case a

20

brother who at one point actually was offered money by

21

the insider but turned it down and preferred the

22

information, those things would not be criminal.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

is a -- is a gift just because it's disclosed.

25

a -- social acquaintances, you know, that people say

social interchange.

6

he should have been more careful about saying, but it's

7

quite different than a gift.

8

however you read Dirks, it certainly doesn't go beyond

9

gifts.

I can't, I'm working on this Google thing, or

You wouldn't call that a gift.

You'd call it a

And maybe it's, you know, something

And it seems to me that,

10

MR. DREEBEN:

So I -- I don't disagree with

11

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

There is a difference between

12

a breach of a duty of confidentiality with respect to

13

information, and the kind of breach that was defined by

14

the SEC in Cady, Roberts and incorporated into the law

15

of securities fraud in this Court's decisions in

16

Chiarella and Dirks.

17

And it has two elements to it.

18

element is that the information was made available to

19

the insider for a corporate purpose and not for personal

20

benefit or personal use.

21

The first

And the second is that the insider is

22

providing it for the purpose of obtaining a personal

23

advantage, either for himself or somebody else.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then the

social -- casual social interchange I -- I hypothesized

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

would not be covered under your interpretation?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

It would not be a personal

3

benefit.

4

part of the tippee if there was an understanding between

5

the parties, the insider and the tippee, that

6

conversations of that kind would remain confidential.

7

Now, it might give rise to liability on the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's hazy -- it's

8

kind of a hazy line to draw, isn't it, between something

9

that you characterize as a gift and something that would

10

be characterized as social interaction, isn't it?

11
12
13

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think it's hazy at

all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it depend how

14

close a friend -- the friends are going away for the

15

weekend, how close the friends are?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There may be -If it's -- then I --

18

I want to give him a gift, because we've been great

19

friends for so many years, as opposed to I just want to

20

tell him why I can't come?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

So the burden is on the

22

government to show that the information was given for a

23

purpose of trading and that it was in breach of

24

fiduciary duty.

25

evidence of any legitimate corporate purpose for the

And in most of these cases, there's no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

disclosure whatsoever.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the difficult part is

3

for a personal advantage, at least to me.

4

question is what counts if the tipper gives inside

5

information to a member -- a family member or friend?

6

When is it for a personal advantage, and when is it not

7

for a personal advantage?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. DREEBEN:

And the

So I think that -Do we decide?

I think, Justice Breyer, that

11

whenever information is given, it's inside information;

12

it's given by an insider to another person for that

13

person to be able to profit on it, something that the

14

insider himself is forbidden to do.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if you know --

It's covered.
If you give it to your --

18

anyone in the world, and -- whom you happen to know, and

19

you believe that that person will trade on it, that is

20

for a personal advantage.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. DREEBEN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes -Yes?

-- because -What is the personal

advantage?

MR. DREEBEN:

property.

personal advantage that you received?

8
9

-- and you're giving a gift of

that information to a person to enable them to profit.

6
7

Uh-huh.

And I think that, to the extent that the

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is a personal

advantage?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Breyer, let me

15

step back for a minute.

16

in Dirks was separate out when an insider was breaching

17

his fiduciary duty by providing information and when he

18

was not.

19

20

What the Court was trying to do

And the line that the Court selected tracks

JUSTICE ALITO:

It doesn't seem to me that

21

your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than

22

Ms. Shapiro's.

23

Now suppose someone, the insider is walking

24

down the street and sees someone who has a really

25

unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

something to make this person's day.

2

the inside information to that person and says, you can

3

make some money if you trade on this.

4

Is that a violation?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

And so he provides

And I'm trying to

6

explain why that is.

7

basic line that sets forth in the duty of loyalty, which

8

is well established, that when you are given something

9

for corporate purposes, you may not use it for personal

10

reasons.

11

in --

12

I think that Dirks adopted the

And that was exactly what the Court adopted

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they did that, why did

13

they use the word "advantage"?

14

back to the -- the part that everybody concedes:

15

tipper is using information he shouldn't use in a way he

16

shouldn't use it.

17

Okay?

The -- you keep going
This

Conceded.

Now, it's the next step of what -- when is

18

he liable, and what the words are is when he uses it for

19

a personal advantage.

20

saying -- and you said this -- whenever the tipper knows

21

that the person, to him, he -- who he gives the

22

information might well use it to trade.

23
24
25

And it sounds to me, as you are

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I did not say that,

Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

What did you say?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

MR. DREEBEN:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

Let -- let me clarify this.
Yes.

What the Court said in

Dirks --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

-- was that it was drawing a

7

line between people who had information for corporate

8

purposes and used it consistently with those purposes,

9

and people who had access to corporate information made

10

available to them only for corporate purposes and used

11

it for personal benefit.

12

And it gave a number of examples.

And I

13

think that the way to understand Dirks is to synthesize

14

the various examples the Court gave to understand the

15

principle underlying the decision.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. DREEBEN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. DREEBEN:

20

The examples -Go ahead.

The examples include direct

MR. DREEBEN:

It also includes something far

less tangible:

And then it clearly included in the category

4

of things that were not appropriate corporate purposes,

5

giving a gift to somebody, and it explained why.

6

give a gift of information to somebody for trading, it

7

is equivalent to the insider using the information to

8

trade himself, and then making a gift of the profits to

9

a recipient.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you

So you are -- you

11

are arguing for an exact relationship between, not for a

12

corporate purpose and for a personal benefit.

13

any area that something falls in the middle of that,

14

that it's -- it's not for a corporate purpose, but it

15

also doesn't qualify for a personal benefit.

16

Is there

Whenever you're talking about how you define

17

personal gain/personal benefit, you say this was

18

given -- not given to him for a corporate purpose.

19

Is it an exact parallel?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

I think it -- I think it is,

Mr. Chief Justice --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So any disclosure of

23

any confidential information is actionable under that to

24

you --

25

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- because it was

not given to him to disclose.
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

That is the difference

4

between the breach of a duty of confidentiality, which

5

may have to do with the corporate officer's duty of

6

care, as distinct from the duty of loyalty.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Give me the example

8

of something that is not for a corporate purpose but is

9

also not for a personal gain, under your view.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

When there's no knowledge that

11

the individual to whom you're going to give the

12

information is trading, there's no breach of the Cady,

13

Roberts duty.

14

conversation, the government would not seek to hold

15

liable somebody who was loose in their conversations but

16

had no anticipation that there would be trading.

17

So in your hypothetical of the social

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not interested

18

in who the government would seek to have liable.

19

interested in what the rule is going to be.

20
21
22
23

MR. DREEBEN:
Mr. Chief Justice.

I'm

I'm equating the two,

I'm not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This Court has not

equated the two.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I understand.

Alderson Reporting Company

But I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

that -- that the -- the rule that we're asking the Court

2

to adopt is really a rule that tracks the basic

3

principles of duty of loyalty that lie at the base of

4

the Dirks opinion.

5

And I realize that the Dirks opinion used

6

language in it; it used a variety of formulations:

7

Personal benefit, personal advantage, personal gain.

8

But the examples that the Court gives, gave to support

9

that doctrinal analysis, I think lead to the conclusion

10

that what Justice Powell was trying to do in the opinion

11

was to distinguish cases in which somebody was a

12

corporate officer, and they used the information for an

13

appropriate purpose; maybe somebody went out and traded

14

on it afterward --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, I'm -- I'm

16

not sure that your solution is going to clarify much of

17

this area, because now I think the fight is going to be

18

over what was the reason that the tipper gave for giving

19

the tip.

20

I mean, in this very case, there were three

21

reasons for breaching the rule of confidentiality.

The

22

first, to -- for Maher to become more knowledgeable of

23

the health care industry.

24

no knowledge his brother would trade, that was not

25

actionable; correct?

Under your reading, if he had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, correct, Justice

2

Sotomayor, but that also was not information that was

3

flowing from the insider to his brother.

4

charged in this case were the circumstances --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

that there are three examples of breaching

7

confidentiality.

8
9

I'm talking about

The first was to -- for him to become more
knowledgeable of the health industry.

10
11

No.

What we

The second was to help the father with his
medical care.

12

And the third, the one you charged, was the

13

giving of information, knowing that his brother was

14

going to trade on it.

15

How do you draw the line among those three?

16

All three were for personal reasons.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

But the only one that

18

involved knowledge or anticipation of trading were the

19

circumstances in which the brother was basically funding

20

his --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23
24
25

So you have --

-- older brother's securities

trading.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if all he did it for

was to get information for his father, had no idea that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

his brother was trading, he would not be liable and his

2

brother wouldn't be liable.

3
4

MR. DREEBEN:

I agree with the first, not

with the second.

5

If I could explain just briefly for just a

6

second.

7

is classical insider trading where an insider who's been

8

given the information for a corporate purpose trades on

9

it, or tips somebody else to trade on it.

10

There are two theories of insider trading.

The second theory is misappropriation.

One

And

11

if the older brother in this instance was given

12

confidential information under a circumstance in which

13

there was an understanding that there would be no use of

14

that information for personal benefit or under the SEC's

15

current Rule 10b5-2, which defines these kinds of close

16

family relationships, siblings, parents and children,

17

husbands and wives, as being relationships that are

18

typically ones in which secrets are protected, the older

19

brother could be charged with misappropriating

20

information from the younger one.

21
22
23

But here we're concerned with the insider's
personal benefit.

And my suggestion, I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it -- but the

24

defendant here is not the insider, and -- and we've been

25

talking about the two brothers.

How far down the line

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

do you go?

Because Salman is not -- he's a relative by

2

marriage, but he's -- he's not -- he gets the money

3

from -- I mean, he gets the tip from the first tippee.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6
7

Correct.
How -- how long does it

continue?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, tipping chains can --

8

can go quite a ways when the information is passed, and

9

the limitation on when the government can charge these

10

cases is a limitation of proof.

11

show that the tippee, perhaps at the end of the chain

12

will be more difficult than the ones earlier in the

13

chain, had knowledge that the information originated in

14

a circumstance in which there was a breach of fiduciary

15

duty for personal benefit.

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We need to be able to

Had knowledge or

should -- should have known.
MR. DREEBEN:

No, with -- in a criminal case

19

we have to show knowledge.

Now, we can rely on

20

conscious avoidance.

21

that the Court clarified in Global-Tech about how

22

knowledge can be inferred when someone deliberately

23

avoids confirming facts of which they -- or should be

24

aware, but that involves a personal culpability that

used a couple of times the phrase "knowledge" or

"anticipation."

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Yes.
So is -- is that something

more than he thinks there could be --

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

that?

You've

Is it as strong as

Yes.
Let me give you this example

because that -- this goes to that, this.
So the person with the inside information

19

has had a few drinks at the country club and is talking

20

to some friends and discloses the inside information

21

to -- to the friends.

22

trades on the information.

23

And one of the friends then

Now, what would you have to prove as to the

24

mental state of the tipper and the tippee?

25

tipper, would you have to prove that he knew that one of

Alderson Reporting Company

As to the

38
1

the friends would trade on the inside information or

2

that he was reckless as to whether the friend would

3

trade on the inside information, he knew this was a

4

person who was in the stock market?

5

And as to the tippee, what would you have to

6

prove?

That the tippee knew that the insider knew that

7

he was going to trade on the information?

8

you have to prove?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

What would

As -- as to the tip -- as to

10

the tipper, we submit that an element of the Cady,

11

Roberts duty is that the insider anticipated that the

12

person to whom he gave the information would trade.

13

Now, he --

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is anticipated the same as

he knew he would?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

I think that knowledge,

17

anticipation, understanding is the language that the

18

Second Circuit has used to describe it all -- all fits

19

the bill.

It's

like, well, I think he might or --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, it's not enough.

betting that he would, but I don't really know.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

Now, in a criminal case, we

need to show a breach of the fiduciary duty.

4

5

intent, and we're going to have to show willfulness in

order to obtain a criminal conviction.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We're also

So why do you want to

8

put knowledge of the -- knowledge that it will be used

9

for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty?

If

10

you do that, then you have to prove that the tippee knew

11

that the tipper thought it would be traded.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, and I don't think that's

13

a very difficult burden because in most of these

14

situations, it's obvious why it's being done.

Dirks did.

22

Dirks adopted the Cady, Roberts formulation of the

23

breach of duty, which to go back to it again, it is of

the transmission of information that was made available

only for a corporate purpose, for personal benefit, with

the intent and knowledge that the individual is going to

Now, it doesn't -JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say it -- it has

4

a sentence here which is exactly what's hanging me up

5

and exactly what I thought you were going to answer

6

before you got cut off.

7

The sentence is:

"The elements exist also

8

when an insider makes a gift of confidential information

9

to a trading relative or friend."

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That doesn't sound as if

12

the writer of those words had in mind any person in the

world.

14

person would, in fact, use the information to trade, but

15

it doesn't say any person in the world.

And the Court's response was to

10

establish.

11

Justice Breyer, is that at the end of the opinion, the

12

portion that Justice Kagan read earlier today, it's on

13

page 667, it's where the Court analyzes why Secrist and

14

the other insiders at Equity Funding had not occasioned

15

liability for Dirks.

16

And the confirmation of this, I think,

JUSTICE BREYER:

What can I read -- now I

17

want you to tell me what I can read to get the

18

explanation of Dirks that the majority of lower courts

19

have followed.

20

not read it as you're reading it.

It seems to me the Second Circuit has

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

For after all, they came to

23

the opposite conclusion.

And are there circuits that

have read it just as you had, said you walk down the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm trying to get it clear in my mind.

MR. DREEBEN:

This involves the classic,

11

prototypical situation that actually arises in the real

12

world and gets prosecuted.

13

There are very few cases that involve this

14

hypothetical of somebody distributing inside

15

information --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not worried about that.

17

I'm not worried so much about this case.

18

about line drawing, and you want to draw a line so that

in which people decide to risk criminal liability to

But the Court makes the statement in it that

So you're not going

23

to prosecute that situation when the tippee goes and

MR. DREEBEN:

The tipper in that situation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44
1

is disclosing information in the context where he has

2

made an express statement, and I'm assuming

3

understandings between the two that the information

4

would not be used.

5

trading.

6

The tipper is not liable for insider

The tippee who then trades may be charged

7

under the misappropriation theory for having taken

8

information from a relationship of confidence or an

9

express statement and an agreement not to use the

10

information, and the fraud there is between the tipper

11

and the tippee, not between, as here, the tipper and the

12

people to whom the tipper owes a fiduciary duty.

13

This is explained in the SEC's Rule 10b5-2,

14

which helps define the kinds of relationships that

15

support a misappropriation theory of liability.

16

But I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what this

17

illustrates is we are not urging a theory in which

18

tippers are per se liable every time inside information

19

is disclosed.

20

theory that was rejected in Dirks.

21

makes that most clear is that there are situations in

22

which inside information can be legitimately revealed,

23

even when it is known that it will occasion trading, and

24

it doesn't violate the insider's fiduciary duty.

25

This isn't a revival of the information

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I think what

Mr. Dreeben, I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

you're taking this way out of existing law.

2

going to suggest that tippees aren't routinely

3

prosecuted when tippers don't know that they are going

4

to trade?

5

you claim that they should have known it was

8

I think they are, and most often it's because

Are you

In a criminal case, we're not

The SEC in a civil case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's plenty --

10

there's a legion of cases I read for this -- preparing

for this argument where the government has said --

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that there are,

Justice Sotomayor, because I don't think that that's

14

what we're -- we're certainly not making that submission

in this case.

So it's irrelevant

whether it's a friend or family member?
MR. DREEBEN:

My submission is that the best

10

way to understand Dirks is that it goes to a breach of

11

fiduciary duty, which would not be limited to two

12

categories like that.

13

Powell, in articulating this species of personal

14

benefit, was attempting to rely on it.

15

explain this before to Justice Breyer.

16

And I don't think that Justice

I was trying to

At the end of the opinion where the Court

17

precisely says that Secrist is not liable because he

18

didn't make any financial advantage, it goes on to say,

19

nor did he make a gift of valuable information to Dirks.

20

Now the Court didn't say, well, Dirks wasn't

21

a close friend.

22

he's out of the picture.

23

Dirks wasn't a relative.

Therefore

The Court applied gift analysis in that

24

situation precisely because the line that the Court was

25

trying to draw was between the appropriate use of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47

corporate information and the inappropriate use.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dreeben, I get your --

3

your theory and why it doesn't make any particular

4

difference.

5

the Court says relatives or friends, the Court, just a

6

sentence before, just talks about an intention to

benefit a recipient --

that recipient has to be.

On the other hand, as you say, almost all of
these cases are relatives and friends.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

of view of principle or application, to draw a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA A. E. SHAPIRO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. SHAPIRO:

The government's argument to

10

this Court illustrates precisely the dangers with

11

leaving a statute -- without having a statutory

12

definition.

13

in its merits briefs and in its argument to this Court,

14

that somehow Section 10(b) and Dirks embody a duty of

15

loyalty standard that's nowhere in either the statute or

16

the Dirks case.

17

The government now says, for the first time

Indeed, they never argued this to the

18

district court, not to the Ninth Circuit, not in the

19

brief in opposition, nor in the Newman case.

20

facts of Newman are actually inconsistent with the

21

standard that the government purports to propose,

22

because the government claims that it will insist that

23

the insider has to have an intention that the tippee

24

trade.

25

see that the undisputed evidence was that with respect

And the

to the Nvidia company tipper, there was no evidence that

2

that insider knew his acquaintance from church was going

3

to trade on the information.

4

any evidence that the other insider was aware that

5

anyone would trade.

6

And likewise, there wasn't

And the other -- the example of the other

7

insider also illustrates that sometimes it's not so

8

clear whether someone has a corporate purpose or a

9

personal purpose, because sometimes purposes are mixed.

10

In that instance, the insider was speaking with an

11

analyst who was checking his financial model, and as the

12

evidence in the case shows -- this happens every day in

13

the markets -- the government argued that he was also

14

seeking career advice from the other individual who was

15

a college friend, but there's no indication there that

16

he knew he was going to trade.

17

And furthermore, the government's argument

18

is completely inconsistent with Dirks.

The facts of

19

Dirks, and it was undisputed on the record, are that the

20

insider secrets disclosed the information.

21

seeking to expose a fraud, but he intended that Dirks

22

would share the information with his institutional

23

clients so that they could trade and drive the price of

whenever inside information is intentionally disclosed
