ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LIBIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves a challenge to a different

12

type of state statute, namely a taxing statute.

13

involves specifically how the State of Iowa taxes

14

dividends received by parent companies doing business

15

there from their foreign subsidiaries and perhaps domestic

16

subsidiaries.

Petitioner is a multi-state, multinational

18

corporation engaged in business throughout this country

19

and in foreign countries.

20

does business in Iowa, of course, and other states.

21

22

million in dividends from foreign subsidiaries,

23

which engaged in business only in foreign countries.

Petitioner challenged the Iowa statute as being

12

facially discriminatory, singling out for inclusion in the

13

tax base only the dividends from foreign subsidiaries

14

doing business in foreign countries.

15

Supreme Court, rejected petitioner's challenge, holding

16

that the statute was constitutional because it could find

17

no basis for a benefit resulting that was peculiar to Iowa

18

with respect to application of the statute.

QUESTION:

The Iowa Court,

Well, Mr. Libin, now I take it that

20

under the Federal Income Tax Code that there is a foreign

21

tax credit and these dividends, if taxed in the foreign

22

country, then a credit is given on the Federal income tax,

23

dollar for dollar.

24

MR. LIBIN:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

provide a second dollar of credit, is that it?
MR. LIBIN:

2

No, we do not request that.

That

3

would be impermissible, I think, and the footnote number

4

30 in Container, in the decision of this Court in

5

Container indicates that a credit at the state level for

6

foreign taxes paid would probably not be permissible

7

because you already have received full credit at the

8

Federal level.

9

QUESTION:

Exactly.

So why isn't it perfectly

10

rational for the state to exclude, then, any recognition

11

of the foreign, or go ahead and tax the foreign subsidiary

12

dividend?

13

MR. LIBIN:

It certainly has the power to tax

14

foreign subsidiary dividends without a credit, Justice

15

O'Connor, but what we believe is clearly correct under

16

this Court's decisions is that it does not have the power

17

to single out those dividends for taxation vis-a-vis all

18

other kinds of dividends, because they're, that is

19

discrimination under the Foreign Commerce Clause.

20

21

taxation, it does not impose a tax on dividends generated

24

on and violates the Foreign Commerce Clause is whether it

is non-discriminatory.

QUESTION:

Well, the state just wants to piggy­

2

back on the Federal income tax law, a perfectly reasonable

3

desire on the part of the state, and many states do the

4

same thing, don't they?

Many states do the same thing.

QUESTION:

Mr. Libin, a minute ago you said you

can't tax dividends from foreign commerce versus dividends

from domestic commerce, but that's one -- it isn't

18

MR. LIBIN:

Under the statutory scheme, Justice

19

Scalia, if a foreign subsidiary does business in the

20

United States dividends paid by it to its parent company

21

will receive an offsetting deduction to reflect that

22

domestic content, so that there is symmetry with respect

23

to that situation and other domestic corporations.

MR. LIBIN:

it is a domestic corporation, it is engaged partly

And is that the same both for Federal

MR. LIBIN:

than a credit for the full amount of foreign taxes paid,

So in one sense, then, for some

taxpayers at least, there is no discrimination?

13

MR. LIBIN:

No, there will always be

QUESTION:

Overall, Mr. Libin, your foreign

subsidiary isn't treated any worse than a domestic

corporation in Iowa, is it?

10

MR. LIBIN:

Yes, it is, Justice Rehnquist,

MR. LIBIN:

It's income is taxed in Iowa, that's

question is whether it favors domestic corporations

QUESTION:

3

Well, supposing you apply my test,

which you may be right, maybe it's not the right one, but

5

generally it doesn't favor foreign corporations over Iowa

6

corporations, does it?
MR. LIBIN:

7
8

Well, we think it does even there if

we appl'ied your test, Mr. Chief Justice, because under the
Armco analysis it would be appropriate to look at the fact

10

that Iowa's tax on earnings would be applied by other

11

jurisdictions as well.

MR. LIBIN:

On the dividend itself, correct, as

the record shows in this case.

discriminates against one category of dividend to the

exclusion of all others, and there is no benefit to Iowa

Exactly right.

They are,

the foreign subsidiaries are singled out for the burden

imposed by the Iowa statute.

4

Now, the respondent and the United States

undertake to suggest perhaps that there's really no

matter of place of incorporation.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

(800) FOR DEPO

So there can't be

1

this case.

And we think that the suggestions of the

2

respondent that we could avoid this problem by using

3

domestic subsidiaries is simply not appropriate because,

4

as was stipulated in this case, there are many reasons why

5

corporations seeking to do business in foreign countries

6

must use foreign subsidiaries, either because the law

7

requires it to do business there or perhaps to own

8

property there or to manufacture there.

That was

stipulated by the parties.
10

As well as the commercial, the obvious

11

commercial advantages of being locally identified, of

12

being able to perhaps deal more easily with banks and with

13

other creditors, and to market goods with local

14

identification.

15

here by respondent that there may be a way to avoid this

16

problem by using domestic corporations is simply not a

17

viable suggestion in our opinion.

18

So the suggestion that has been offered

We also think that the notion of a domestic

1

holding company, which was also proposed, to own the

20

stocks of foreign subsidiaries --

21

QUESTION:

Why?

What's the matter with that?

22

MR. LIBIN:

23

exactly how it works, frankly.

24

tax advice that we received.

25

suggests that you must do this outside of Iowa because

Well, number one, we're not clear on
It was sort of unsolicited
But I think respondent

1

Iowa would tax these dividends when they were paid to the

2

foreign, to the domestic holding company, and if you

3

assume every state has Iowa's tax, which is a perfectly

4

appropriate assumption in issues of this sort, then it,

5

the dividends would be taxed by any state where you formed

6

a holding company.

7

Ultimately we think it's a matter of not being

8

free to make a tax neutral decision, as many cases in this

9

Court have indicated is one of the values recognized by

10

the Commerce Clause, that state laws that effectively

11

induce you or require you to make a decision as to how to

12

operate because of tax considerations violate the Commerce

13

Clause.

14

QUESTION:

Well, don't all tax laws pressure you

15

to operate one way or another?

16

MR. LIBIN:

Well, they give you choices,

17

obviously, in the original structure of your operations.

18

Of course, Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct.

19

QUESTION:

Well, what case of ours is it that

20

you think says that if a tax law tends to push you one way

21

or another it violates the Commerce Clause?

22

MR. LIBIN:

Well, I think we have seen in the

23

Halliburton case, for example, where there was a use tax

24

imposed for property bought or manufactured or self-

25

2

down that statute was that it basically induced people to

3

construct the assets in Louisiana, and it did so because

4

of tax motivations, and therefore --

5
6

7

One of the points the Court made in striking

QUESTION:

You think that case is still good

MR. LIBIN:

Well, I think its basic concepts

law?

8

have been followed and applied in cases like Boston Stock

9

Exchange where this same issue was raised.

You, the New

10

York statute in Boston Stock Exchange effectively induced

11

people to sell their securities in New York to avoid a

12

higher tax, and therefore it foreclosed a tax neutral

13

decision on where to make the sale.

14

And certainly in structuring foreign operations

15

there are many considerations besides taxes that must be

16

taken into account, and if it develops that a tax law

17

ultimately forecloses those options because it directs you

18

in a particular, to establish your structure in a

19

particular way, then it becomes unconstitutional.

20

QUESTION:

But the basic decision of a state to

21

levy a tax at all certainly pushes the corporation one way

22

or the other.

23

MR. LIBIN:

It certainly does.

The tax simply

24

cannot be discriminatory.

with Iowa taxing these dividends, but if it's going to tax

We have no problem, as we said,

qualitatively different because the underlying income from

Or is that just another way of saying

that there is discrimination in your view?
MR. LIBIN:

3

Well, there's certainly

4

discrimination on the face of it under any circumstances.

5

Whether that unique character justifies it, we would say

6

no, Justice Kennedy, because that ignores, as we were

7

suggesting earlier, the fact that foreign subsidiaries pay

8

taxes in their foreign countries.

9

burdens with respect to the earnings that they generate as

10

They bear the same

domestic subsidiaries do.
So the uniqueness of the foreign dividend is

only the fact that it's the first time the funds come

followed the argument at one point, but I think your

opponents contend that the discrimination actually favors

the foreign subsidiaries because they're only taxing the

whether it's appropriate even to take the tax on earnings

And your answer, I

think, is well, they're subjected to a tax by the foreign

government.

Now, apart from that is there another answer?

Yes, because, the other answer is

it's not appropriate to take the domestic subsidiary tax

In the Madden case and the

situated taxpayers involved, where you had a situation,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15
16

MS. MASON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Iowa corporate income tax does not

17

discriminate against foreign commerce.

Kraft includes

18

foreign dividends in its Iowa apportionable tax base

1

because of the way it chooses to structure its business,

20

and not because it engages in foreign commerce.

21

some methods or structures of operating will be more

22

profitable than other methods, but Kraft's conclusion that

23

the use of foreign subsidiaries is integral to doing

24

foreign commerce is based on lots of factors unrelated to

25

taxes and which may vary depending on the type of business

Obviously

1

you look at and the particular foreign country in which

2

they do business.

3

The parties stipulated that multinational '

4

corporations typically do foreign commerce through foreign

5

subsidiaries for various reasons, and the non-exclusive

6

reasons listed included the better ability to limit their

7

liability in the foreign country, the marketing advantages

8

of being perceived as being a local company, a greater
ease in borrowing of money in that country, and so forth.

10

The parties did not stipulate that all foreign countries

11

require that in order to do commerce in those countries

12

you use a foreign subsidiary.

13

QUESTION:

That was not stipulated to.

May I interrupt with just --

14

recalling the dialogue with Justice White by your

15

opponent, what about the suggestion that the very

commerce, the payment by a foreign subsidiary to a

domestic parent?

20

Isn't that a transaction in foreign

MS. MASON:

I don't believe the State of Iowa

21

has ever argued that that is not part of commerce.

22

the State of Iowa is arguing is that Kraft can do the same

23

thing that it does, can do foreign commerce, can do

business in these foreign countries through domestically

QUESTION:

2

I'm not sure that's responsive to, if

3

I understood Justice White's question at any rate, of the

4

concern that the flow of money across national boundaries

5

in these dividends is taxed differently than a similar

6

flow of money within the United States, and therefore

7

there's a discrimination, at least a differential

8

treatment between domestic and foreign.
MS. MASON:

Well, there obviously is a

differential treatment between domestic and foreign

dividends.

That's, that just goes without --

MS. MASON:

No, we don't believe that that

follows.
QUESTION:

But if the dividend is itself a

transaction in commerce, why is that not so?
MS. MASON:

Because we believe that it's not

19

proper to focus solely on the Internal Revenue Code and

20

therefore the Iowa treatment of dividends without looking

21

beyond dividends to the income of the entire unitary

22

business that is being taxed.

23

looking at two different taxes here, it's all the Iowa

differently.

2

Internal Revenue Code has, which is how the underlying

3

earnings from which the dividends are paid get treated.

4

And that reason is the same reason the

The foreign earnings, as you pointed out

5

previously, do not all get taxed.

A lot of times foreign

6

earnings are reinvested in the foreign country and used to

7

expand operations there.

8

earnings get taxed in the Internal Revenue Code, and

The only time the foreign

therefore also by Iowa, is if they are returned to the
10

U.S. shareholder in the form of dividends, and then it's

11

only that amount that gets returned as dividends that is

12

taxed.

13

But with the domestic subsidiary, whether it's

14

doing business in the United States or doing business

15

abroad, all of its earnings will be taxed by the United

16

States and an apportioned share will be taxed in the

17

states in which it does business.

18

So we believe it's not proper to focus only on

1

how the dividends are treated.

20

Iowa can't win, because it's just obvious that we are

treating domestic dividends differently from foreign

subsidiary dividends paid out of foreign earnings.

We believe that if you look at the entire

that the subsidiaries are really an extension of Kraft's
