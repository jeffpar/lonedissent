ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. TCHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

We'll hear argument

This case raises the question of whether the

11

Federal Adoption Assistance Act and Child Welfare Act of

12

1980, specifically the provision commonly referred to as

13

the reasonable efforts clause,

14

enforceable under 42 USC section 1983.

15

efforts clause states that in order to be eligible for

16

Federal foster care reimbursement funds, that States must

17

have a plan approved by the secretary that provides that

18

in each case reasonable efforts will be made to keep or

19

return a child home.

Court of

enforceable right.
The State of Illinois maintains that although

3

the Adoption Assistance Act is mandatory and benefits the

4

plaintiffs here, that it is simply too vague and amorphous

5

to create a Federal right.

6

This Court has stated that in order to create

7

Federal rights upon the States, Congress must speak with a

8

clear voice because of the values and concerns inherent in

9

our system of Government, and that clear voice and clear

10
11

statement is simply lacking here.
One of the elements of determining whether a

12

clear statement has been provided by Congress under

13

section 1983 is whether the interest asserted by the

14

plaintiffs is too vague and amorphous such that it is

15

beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.

16

What the Seventh Circuit did here was to take

17

this notion of competence of the judiciary in the

18

abstract. It never looked at the statute at issue here and

19

simply said, that because courts have proved competent to

20

enforce a reasonableness terms in other statutes that have

21

no relation to the statute at hand here, that therefore,

22

courts are competent to enforce this particular reasonable

23

efforts clause.

24
25

But this reasonable efforts clause stands in
stark contrast, for example, to the clause construed by

this Court in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association.

2

Wilder this Court held that the Boren amendment to the

3

Medicaid act created a Federal right to reasonable and

4

adequate Medicaid reimbursement rates, but it did so after

5

a lengthy and extensive analysis of the statute at hand.

6

In

And what this Court found was that the Boren

7

amendment there set forth a lengthy list of specific

8

factors, specific objective benchmarks defining what meant

9

reasonable.

There are no such benchmarks or factors

10

here, and what we are left with is a reasonable efforts

11

clause with no definition supplied by Congress that will

12

subject the States to a substantive right to reasonable

13

efforts that will be defined not by Congress but by

14

individual judges applying their own notions of

15

reasonableness.

16

QUESTION:

What about the Sherman Act?

Doesn't

17

the Sherman Act do the same thing in spades?

18

State laws regularly on the basis of a determination that

19

the courts are supposed to make, that there has been an

20

unreasonable restraint of trade.

21

MS. TCHEN:

We preempt

But what is missing here, Justice

22

Scalia, is a specific designation that Congress intended

23

to create a Federal right.

24

is we must -- there is no specific designation of a

25

Federal right or Federal intent to create a national

QUESTION:

2

Well, I may agree with you on that,

3

but not because it is too vague.

4

vagueness have to do with whether the right exists or not?

5

You cannot create the right unless it is highly defined?
MS. TCHEN:

6

I mean, what does

What this Court has said in Wilder

7

is to set out a three-part test for when under section

8

1983 this Court can infer a congressional intent to create

9

a Federal right, and the third element of that test is

10

whether the interest is too vague and amorphous.

11

have a statute that we agree is mandatory, benefits

12

plaintiffs, but it is simply too vague, and what this

13

Court has said in Wilder is that there cannot be a Federal

14

right unless there is a specific objective benchmark

15

provided by Congress that measures what is reasonable, and

16

that's what is lacking here.

18

Here we

I think it is important to note that the
reasonable efforts that we are talking about here --

19

QUESTION:

Let me ask you on that point, is it

20

so vague that the Secretary could never enforce this

21

provision?

22

MS. TCHEN:

No, what the Secretary does and the

23

Congress has specifically delegated to the Secretary the

24

authority to approve a plan, to make sure that it provides

25

reasonable efforts or to withdraw funds if not.

QUESTION:

1

Well, suppose it -- you have a plan

approved such as this one and then assume the State or

whatever the agency is, did absolutely nothing to

implement it, could the funds be withdrawn?

11

12

exists to remedy deprivation of Federal rights, and what

13

we have to find here is whether there is a Federal right

14

that exists, not merely a mandatory Federal statute that

15

may be violated.

16

Again, section 1983 does not exist
Section 1983

I think it is important to note, we can always

17

state the most egregious case where a statute we would all

18

agree has been clearly violated, but that doesn't answer

19

the question of whether there is a Federal right that is

20

created.

21

QUESTION:

Why can't you use the same test to

22

ask whether a Federal right has been violated, but where

23

nothing at all is being done?

24

MS. TCHEN:

benchmark that governs not only the easy case that you

have posed, which is where there is simply no efforts at

2

all that are being exerted by the State, but also the

3

harder case, which I submit is this case.

4

QUESTION: . But that is what Justice Scalia's

5

question was directed to, is that reasonableness is a

6

standard that is judicially enforceable in other contexts,

7

but you say not in this context.
MS. TCHEN:

8

9

I say not in this case because for

example, in this case, this is not the case where the

10

State was making no reasonable efforts at all, never

11

assigning --

12

13

QUESTION:

But this case will decide that case

MS. TCHEN:

I think that is true, and I think

as well.

14
15

the problems in this case demonstrate the problems with

16

having a reasonable efforts clause that is not defined by

17

Congress.

18

found was that after the State of Illinois instituted a

19

remedial plan to assign caseworkers more quickly, 83

20

percent of the time the district court found the State of

21

Illinois was assigning a caseworker within 10 calendar

22

days, less than 2 weeks.

23

In this case, what the district court below

court found that to be unreasonable.

1

in which a delay in assigning a caseworker would be

2

reasonable.

3

For example, the State of Illinois is under

4

another consent to create another Federal case that

5

requires the State to provide a Spanish-speaking

6

caseworker only to Spanish-speaking families and children.

7

But a Spanish-speaking caseworker may not be available

8

within the 3 days that the injunction requires or even the

9

10 days in which 83 percent of the cases were assigned.
There are other instances.

10

We had testimony in

11

the preliminary injunction action that a 3-day across the

12

board rule such as was imposed by the district court here

13

requires us to assign a caseworker to a case with less

14

risk, the truant teenager case, as quickly as we assign a

15

case to the severely burned infant.

16

It is simply -- it's an intrusion by the Federal

17

court on that very specific decision making that child

18

welfare administrators are supposed to make and what

19

Congress intended child welfare administrators to make.
QUESTION:

20

Is there anything about the subject

21

matter of the judgment which makes the Secretary more

22

competent, or perhaps I should say a more appropriate

23

person to make the judgment about reasonableness than a

24

court?

25

MS. TCHEN:

I think so, Justice Souter.

This is

1

particularly an area where we don't know what works with

2

abused and neglected children, and I think it's important

3

to note that at the time the act was passed in 1980, this

4

whole concept of requiring States to make reasonable

5

efforts to keep abused children in abusive homes was

6

somewhat new to the States, which is why there was a

7

delayed effective date, and which is why the Secretary in

8

promulgating regulations specifically stated that he made

9

the determination it was better to leave the flexibility

10

to the States and to allow States to make their

11

determinations of how they were going to meet the

12

reasonable efforts clause, allow the States to make the

13

policy decisions of how to balance scarce resources and

14

allocate scarce resources in this very difficult area.
It is, again, I think important to note,

agreement.

factors in the statute.
Here we have no marketplace for reasonable

3

efforts, and we have a much more difficult decision than

4

determining what are reasonable rates or reasonable rents,

5

and yet the plaintiffs ask us to find a Federal right in a

6

statute that provides not only less guidance than the

7

Boren amendment or the regulations in Wright, but

8

absolutely no guidance whatsoever.

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Tchen, do you acknowledge that

10

the statute requires the State to make reasonable efforts

11

in each case?

12

13

MS. TCHEN:

We agree.

We recognize that the

statute requires reasonable efforts in each case.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. TCHEN:

16

QUESTION:

Where does it require that?
Well, it states -As I read it, the section we are

17

talking about, 671(a)(15) requires the State to come up

18

with a plan that would produce reasonable efforts, but

19

nothing is perfect.

20

reasonable efforts, the fact that now and then it may in a

21

particular case not produce that would not seem to me to

22

violate (a) (15), but you think it does?

23

MS. TCHEN:

I mean, if the plan provides for

No, what we think is, it wouldn't

24

necessarily violate (a)(15), which requires the State to

25

have a plan that provides reasonable efforts.

There is a

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. TCHEN:

What does it violate then?
There is a separate section, section

4

672(a) that says that in individual cases, that in order

5

to receive Federal reimbursement, there must be a State

6

judicial determination of whether reasonable efforts were

7

made in the best interest of the child.
Now it is also the case however, Justice Scalia,

8

9

that Congress recognized there are going to be a lot of

10

cases where there should be no reasonable efforts made at

11

all because of the best interests of the child which the

12

State courts are required to balance as well in section

13

672 explicitly and this individualized decision making is

14

what was intended under the reasonable efforts clause

15

because the clause itself reads, in each case.

16

It doesn't say a system of reasonable efforts,

17

which is what the plaintiffs are seeking here.

18

a substantive right to allow a Federal court to judge

19

whether there is a system of reasonable efforts by the

20

State.

They want

But there is nowhere in the statute, the plain

QUESTION:

What's the difference between a

system and a plan in your view?
MS. TCHEN:

Here the plan is an actual document,

as in many other Federal and State cooperative funding

acts, which requires that the State put together a

6

document, submit it to the Secretary and have it approved.

they are trying to do is say there is not just a right to

courts to do under this undefined substantive right to

plaintiffs have even cited one coming out of the Third

MR. ROBERTS:

First of all, the Sherman Act

specifically directs the courts to enforce the provision.

3

There is no such direction to Federal courts in this case.

Second of all, I think the Sherman Act does

In this case the regulations also don't answer
the question, reasonable with respect to what?

The case

is therefore not like this Court's decision in Wright

11

where the Court relied on regulations defining what was

12

included in rent in holding that tenants could enforce a

13

rent ceiling under section 1983.

14

Here the secretary specifically determined not

15

to define reasonable efforts in the implementing

regulations.

QUESTION:

Does that mean, Mr. Roberts, that the

18

secretary could never withhold funds for failure to comply

19

with this provision?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

The secretary can

21

enforce the reasonable efforts provision by engaging in

precisely the sort of social policy judgments that are

If the Federal courts are going to enforce a supposed

Is there something peculiar about the

judgments about the appropriate determination of the way

In other words, one of the benchmark problems in

And in fact, in the Wilder case, less than a

year and a half ago, this Court again affirmed that

Federal courts are capable of enforcing reasonableness

8

would be required to look at, among other things, what

9

constitutes adequate health care, what constitutes

10

reasonable access to adequate health care, whether or not

11

the State's Medicaid rates adequately account for the

12

particular needs of individual hospitals serving a

which, under this Court's decision in Wilder, the courts

States substantial discretion in how they are to implement

their obligations under the statute.

4

In keeping with Wilder then, plaintiffs will be

under a heavy burden to show that the State's conduct fell

6

outside of the range permitted by Congress under the

7

statute.

8

9

In fact, in the Winston case which we addressed
in our supplemental memorandum, the Court of Appeals for

10

the Third Circuit showed how this heavy burden and this

11

substantial discretion will prevent the sort of flood of

12

litigation which defendants predict from ever occurring.

13

In that case the court first confirmed that the

14

reasonable efforts requirement created enforceable rights

15

under section 1983 but then it went on to hold that

16

Pennsylvania's visitation policies were within the range

17

of conduct permitted by Congress under the statute.

18

Pennsylvania had in fact exercised appropriate

19

professional judgment, appropriate discretion in setting

20

up those visitation policies, and as a result the court

21

affirmed the judgment of the district court in favor of

the State and county defendants.

this Court has held that the secretary's ability to cut

off funding or approve or disapprove a plan does not

provide an indication that Congress intended to foreclose

enforcement of a statute under section 1983, which this

Court has repeatedly held is intended to provide a broad

remedy for violations of Federal rights, privileges and

The Adoption Assistance

Mr. Dsida, the secretary has the

13

power that you are asserting as well, right, under 671(b),

14

the secretary could cut off funds for failure of the State

15

to keep up its promises, right?

But that does not preclude our ability to enforce

keep children out of foster care whenever possible and

enforcement of the reasonable efforts requirement is

consistent with that purpose and is required by the

The reasonable efforts requirement is at the

heart of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act and

3

consistent with Congress's intent, it must be enforceable.

QUESTION:

I take it the reason that Heckler v.

5

Chaney would apply in your view is that there is no

6

meaningful standard to judge the secretary's actions?

7

MR. DSIDA:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe that

8

is the case. Heckler v. Chaney provides the State, I am

9

sorry, provides the agency substantial discretion in

10

determining how to enforce a particular statutory

11

provision.
QUESTION:

12

But the reason there was no action

13

permitted there was there was no meaningful standard by

14

which to measure the secretary's actions.

15

MR. DSIDA:

Your Honor, if I recall that case,

16

Your Honor, I think ultimately it turned on whether or not

17

there are specific standards which the State or which the

18

secretary is obligated to adhere to in enforcing the

19

statute.

20

There are no particular guidelines or there is

21

no flow chart or something to that effect dictating how

22

the secretary is obligated to review the State's plan.

23

The secretary does in fact have some discretion in making

24

those determinations, but there is not -- there is

certainly a means for courts or the secretary to use in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA M. TCHEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MS. TCHEN:

Three brief points.

In response to

13

Justice Souter's questions regarding the record and the

14

allocation of State resources, when the district court

15

indicated its intent to impose a 3-day across the board

16

mandatory injunction on the State, the State administrator

17

over the case assignment process, Mr. Goad, did submit a

18

supplemental affidavit, it's at the district court record,

19

item under 96 in which Mr. Goad stated that to comply with

20

the 3-day across the board injunction which was not what

21

the State's original plan was with respect to caseworker

22

assignment, would require the reallocation of resources

23

from other areas in the department's budget.

We were unclear - -

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

Is the

10

question whether, quote, reasonable efforts, unquote, have

11

been made a question of Federal law or State law?

12

MS. TCHEN:

In the instance, in section 672

13

where there is individual determinations delegated

14

specifically by Congress to the States, we believe it is a

15

matter of the States looking at their individual case law,

how they weigh best interests of the child --
