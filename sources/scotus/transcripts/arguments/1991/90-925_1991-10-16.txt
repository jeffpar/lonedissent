ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In ithis case, the Court of Appeals for the

12

Second Circuit found that the Attorney General of the

13

United States abused his discretion in denying Mr.

14

Doherty's motion to reopen his deportation hearing.

15

court of appeals accordingly remanded the case for an

16

evidentiary hearing on Mr. Doherty's claim that he should

17

be granted asylum in the United States and that he should

18

be deported to some country other than the United Kingdom.

19

We request this Court to reverse the decision of

20

the Second Circuit on two independent grounds that I would

21

like outline briefly in order to clarify what the issues

22

are for this Court to decide today.

i

23

The

First, we ask this Court to hold that the

24

Attorney General had discretion to deny reopening because

25

Mr. Doherty did not establish that he had good cause for

failing to raise his claims for asylum and withholding of

2

deportation at his deportation hearing in September of

3

1986.

4

and fair opportunity to raise those claims at that hearing

5

and that he deliberately abandoned the claims as part of a

6

tactical strategy that ultimately failed.

The Attorney General determined that he had a full

7

If this Court finds that the Attorney General

8

properly denied reopening on this ground, and that this

9

was not an arbitrary or unseasoned abuse of discretion,

10

then it need not reach any of the other issues in this

11

case, because that ground would in and of itself would be

12

dispositive under this Court's decision in INS v. Abudu.

13

As a second and independent ground of reversal,

14

we ask this Court to find that the Attorney General

15

properly exercised his discretion in determining that Mr.

16

Doherty's claims for withholding of deportation and asylum

17

were just simply not sufficiently meritorious to warrant

18

the extraordinary remedy of reopening.

19

I'd like to turn first to the issue of whether

20

or not Mr. Doherty established good cause for failure to

21

file his claims or pursue his claims in September 1986 at

22

his deportation hearing, since we submit thatthis

23

decision in INS v. Abudu is in fact controlling

24

ground.

1

this Court has looked at the question of what the Attorney-

2

General or the Board of Immigration Appeals' discretion is

3

to deny reopening for failure to show good cause to raise

4

the claim at the initial deportation hearing.

5

three occasions in this Court's decision in Rios-Pineda,

6

in the Wang decision, and most recently in Abudu, this

7

Court found that the denial of reopening on these grounds

8

must be sustained unless the decision is arbitrary and
unseasoned.

In all

We submit that there is simply no way that

10

the Attorney General's determination on this issue in this

11

case was arbitrary or unseasoned.

12

This Court's decision in Abudu illustrates that

13

there are essentially two interrelated requirements for

14

establishing good cause to file an application for

15

withholding of deportation or asylum after the deportation

16

hearing has been closed.

17

And these requirements are, first, under the

18

regulations, Mr. Doherty is required to reasonably

1

explain, to provide a legally sufficient explanation of

20

why he did not raise the claims or pursue the claims at

21

the initial deportation hearing.

22

that his claims for withholding of deportation and asylum

23

are based upon evidence or circumstance that arose

24

subsequent to the hearing.

25

And second, he also show

1

or not Mr. Doherty has ever provided a reasonable

2

explanation of why he didn't pursue these claims in

3

September of 1986.

4

reason that he didn't pursue the claims in September of

5

1986 was that he had an opportunity to do so, but he

6

was -- it was part of an effort on his part to designate

7

Ireland as the country of deportation, to withdraw his

8

claims for asylum and withholding of deportation, and to

9

try to expedite his deportation so that he could reach

The Attorney General found that the

10

Ireland before the supplemental extradition treaty took

11

effect.

12

QUESTION:

Was it customary that people faced

13

with deportation could indicate the country they'd like to

14

go to, and if the country were willing to accept them that

15

normally that's where the person would be sent?

16

the standard practice?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

Was that

Your Honor, under the statute,

18

under 243(a), an alien has the opportunity to designate

19

the country that he wants to be deported to.

20

statute specifically provides that the Attorney General

21

may reject that designation if, in his view, it would be

22

prejudicial to the interests of the United States.

23

the standard practice before the immigration judges that's

24

been in effect for many years, in fact probably 50 years,

25

is that when a national of a country designates a country

But the

And

other than his country of nationality, the immigration
judge gives him an opportunity to submit a claim for
withholding of deportation or asylum to the country of
nationality.
The whole idea here is that it is critical to
the process that all of the defenses to deportation be
asserted at the time of the deportation hearing in order
to avoid piecemeal appeals.
QUESTION:

Was it at all a surprise that the

Attorney General designated the United Kingdom instead of
Ireland as had been designated?
MS. MAHONEY:
was a surprise.

Your Honor, I do not believe it

The INS took the position at the hearing

in September of '86 that it was the position of the United
States that Mr. Doherty should not be deported to Ireland,
that it would be prejudicial to the United States'
interests, that this was an issue of serious concern at
the highest levels, and when that argument was rejected by
the immigration judge, the INS indicated that it would
appeal that decision because it was sufficiently concerned
that deportation to Ireland would be prejudicial.
So there really can be no question that Mr.
Doherty understood in September of 1986 that he was at
risk.
And similarly, Your Honor, there was no reason

why he couldn't plead in the alternative.

In this Court's

2

decision in Abudu, Dr. Abudu was in precisely the same

3

kind of circumstance.

4

country that he wanted to be deported to, but he was a

5

national of Ghana.

6

just like the immigration judge in this case, gave him the

7

opportunity to apply for withholding of deportation to

8

Ghana and for asylum, an opportunity that Dr. Abudu did

9

not avail himself of.

He designated England as the

So the immigration judge in that case,

And thereafter when he sought to

10

reopen the proceedings in order to do that, this Court

11

found that he was barred, because you are permitted to

12

plead in the alternative.

13
14
15

There's simply no reason -- the issue in
September of 1986 that was presented -QUESTION:

Of course in that case he didn't have

16

the reason that's advanced here.

17

MS. MAHONEY:

18
19

Your Honor, he did have the reason

that's advanced here.
QUESTION:

No, his reason was some dentist had

20

called on him or something like that, and that was the

21

only new development.

MS. MAHONEY:

QUESTION:

MS. MAHONEY:

25

Oh, in Abudu?

In Abudu, yeah.
Oh, in that it was an official in

the foreign government who had come to his house - 8

MS. MAHONEY:
And this Court

6

Oh, and said they needed a doctor in

They said they needed a doctor.

--

QUESTION:

And we said that wasn't enough to

justify it.

7

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, this Court found that it may

8

well have been new in material evidence, but that he

9

actually had a sufficient basis to assert his claim at the

10

time of the hearing, and therefore, it couldn't constitute

11

a reasonable explanation for having failed to raise the

12

claim at the time of the initial hearing.

13

Similarly in this case, Mr. Doherty has never

14

contended that he did not have adequate grounds to claim

15

that he fearpersecution in the United Kingdom.

16

Essentially --

17

QUESTION:

But even if he had adequate grounds

18

in the first place, if there was a new development that

19

was sufficiently significant, Abudu wouldn't have said he

20

couldn't have raised a new ground.

1

QUESTION:

Because I remember the case.

2

MS. MAHONEY:

This Court in Abudu didn't clarify

3

the precise bounds of the discretion that the board would

4

have or that the Attorney General would have, but this

5

Court did assume in Abudu that the new evidence was

6

material, but that - -

7

QUESTION:

But not sufficiently important.

8

That's the last part of the opinion, as I remember.

9

separate question was whether the new evidence had

10

sufficient significance to justify withholding, even

11

though he'd had sufficient basis originally.

12

MS. MAHONEY:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So in this case, though, there's a

14

difference in what the new development is.

15

arguably more significant than the visit from the man

16

saying they needed another doctor in Ghana.

17

A

MS. MAHONEY:

And is

Your Honor, I believe that it's

18

less significant.

19

essentially what happened here, the change was that Mr.

20

Doherty lost on appeal.

21

QUESTION:

And the reason I say that is

The issue in September --

Well, and the law changed and he's

22

going to go to England in any event now, which he wouldn't

23

have -- which would not have been the fact at the time

24

that you say he had to make his election.

25

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Your Honor, at the time that

1

he had to make his election -- you're referring to the

2

change in Irish law?

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, first of all, I think that

5

it's difficult for Mr. Doherty to claim that Irish law

6

changed in a way that was in fact prejudicial to him since

7

he in fact represented to the board in December of 1 86

8

that decisions of the Irish Supreme Court had, quote,
"vitiated

the political offense exception, thereby

10

removing any obstacle," end quote, to his extradition from

11

Ireland to the United Kingdom.

12

of the change in Irish law is really one that, is difficult

13

to understand how he could be making.

14

Moreover - -

15

QUESTION:

So I think that the issue

Are you saying if he'd, even at the

16

time of the election, if he'd been deported to Ireland at

17

that time, he still would have gone right to England in

18

any event?

1

Is that what you're basically saying?
MS. MAHONEY:

Saying that the law of extradition

20

in Ireland at that time is not fundamentally different to

21

what it is now.

22

QUESTION:

Well, does that mean that the net

23

result of it is that if he'd gone to Ireland he still

24

would have gone right away to England?

25

MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, that isn't what we
11

1

would say.
QUESTION:

2

3
4

Well, then that's different, isn't

it?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, because both before the change

5

in Irish law and after the adoption of the European

6

Convention on Terrorism, there was the possibility that

7

the Irish Government would not extradite him.

8

the Attorney General noted in his opinion that there was

9

recently a member of the PIRA who was not extradited to

10

In fact,

the U.K. under the new extradition act --

11

QUESTION:

Let me ask you -- it's very difficult

12

to sort out all these things.

13

everything, is it not more probable now that if he goes to

14

Ireland he will immediately go to England than it was at

15

the time he made his election?

16

MS. MAHONEY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. MAHONEY:

But cutting through

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

You don't think so.
Because even the new law has

19

exceptions in it that allows the alien, or excuse me, the

20

person subject to extradition in Ireland to try to

21

establish that he's being -- the reason for the

22

extradition is for persecution reasons.

23

QUESTION:

Well, of course the court of appeals

24

didn't agree with you.

25

MS. MAHONEY:

No, but the court of appeals

1

really --

2

QUESTION:

On this issue either.

3

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, the court of appeals rested

4

more on the question of whether or not the rejection of

5

the designation by the Attorney General provided a

6

reasonable explanation for Mr. Doherty's failure to pursue

7

his claims for withholding of deportation and asylum at

8

the time of the hearing in 1986.

9
10
11

Maybe the best way to try to put this in
perspective is -QUESTION:

Before you do that, if it is as you

12

say, why would he have had this change of heart?

13

a change in the attitudes of the Irish Government recently

14

or in the makeup of the Irish Government?

15
16

MS. MAHONEY:
to Ireland?

Is there

Why would he no longer wish to go

Is that the question?

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes.
Your Honor, that question is not

19

answered by the Attorney General or by the courts in this

20

case, but I would note that he filed his motion to reopen

21

the proceedings based upon the change in Irish law less

22

than 1 month after the Attorney General Meese sent him a

23

letter stating that he had accepted the INS appeal from

24

the board's rejection of.the designation letter.

25

therefore, he may well have surmised that it was likely

And

1

that the Attorney General would overturn the board's

2

decision allowing him to go to Ireland.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

I thought that -- didn't Attorney

General Meese order him to be sent to England?
MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, he did, Your Honor, but the

6

motion to reopen based upon the change in Irish law was

7

filed less than a month after the Attorney General,

8

Attorney General Meese notified Mr. Doherty that he had

9

accepted the appeal of the INS from the board's decision.

10
11

Therefore, one inference that we could make is that -QUESTION:

You think he was rolling the dice,

12

that what he'd like most of all was to stay in this

13

country, not be deported at all.

14

for that initially.

15

to get that, he'd say I better have a -- I'd better have a

16

fall-back position, and that's when he said send me to

17

Ireland, even though it was no more attractive later than

18

it was originally.

19

And he went whole hog

Then when it seemed he wasn't going

MS. MAHONEY:

One intermediate step, Your Honor.

20

I think initially he wanted to stay in the United States.

21

In the summer of 1986 when the United States Senate

22

adopted the supplemental extradition treaty, he very much

23

wanted to leave the United States as quickly as possible

24

because he was concerned that he would be extradited under

25

that treaty.

So then he designated Ireland.
14

Then when

1

it --

and that designation was accepted, but then when

2

the plan failed and he was not deported to Ireland as

3

quickly as he wanted to be, and it became at least

4

possible that the Attorney General was going to reject

5

that designation, I think he then changed strategy again,

6

and filed the motion to reopen.

7

QUESTION:

May I ask another question?

I don't

8

have the dates as well in mind as I should, but I was

9

under the impression that the Attorney General objected

10

vigorously to his being deported to Ireland because he

11

thought it was a matter of important American national

12

policy that he go to England, which assumed -- made me

13

think the Attorney General thought there was some

14

difference.

15

everybody should have known he'd end up in Ireland -- in

16

England right a way, no matter which place he went.

i

17

And as I understand your argument now,

MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, the Attorney

18

General did not find that he would certainly end up in

19

England no matter what.
QUESTION:

21

saying he would have.

22

23

He simply found that the --

But that's my point.

MS. MAHONEY:

But you're

That's what I think you're telling

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not

24

being clear.

25

difference in the extradition law of Ireland either before

I'm saying that there wasn't a material

or after the adoption of the new extradition act.

In

other words, that there was a chance that he would not be
extradited to the United Kingdom under the old law and
also under the new law.

The Attorney General in fact

noted that a member of the PIRA was not extradited under
the new law, just as sometimes they had not been under the
old law.
I think the key thing here is that Irish law
really isn't germane to the question that was before the
immigration judge in September of 1986.

The issue in that

proceeding was should Mr. Doherty be deported to the
United Kingdom.

And Mr. Doherty had several defenses to

that available to him, and consistent with standard
pleading and INS practice, he was required to assert all
of them in the alternative.

He could claim withholding of

deportation, he could claim a right to designate Ireland,
he could claim asylum.

And that was the procedure that

was followed in Abudu, and it is the standard procedure
that has always been followed.
This Court recognized in 1963 in United States
v. Foti, that Congress very much wanted to encourage the
consolidation of all defenses to deportation in one
hearing on the merits.

So we are back to the question,

why didn't Mr. Doherty simply plead in the alternative?

failure to plead for sustaining the Attorney General's

QUESTION:

Well, that may be so.

But I just

wondered if there was another reason.
MS. MAHONEY:

additional reasons.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor, there are

Well, your time is certainly running.
The -- if we look to issue of the

13

merits, we can look first at the issue of asylum.

14

this Court has indicated on a number of occasions that it

15

is appropriate in considering motions to reopen to

16

determine whether or not the alien has a sufficient claim

17

on the merits that the extraordinary remedy of reopening

18

is warranted.

19

Now

With respect to the asylum claim, the Attorney

20

General determined that reopening would in effect be

21

futile because he - - there were three grounds on which he

And second, he also found that it was

withholding an asylum at the time of the September 1986

It's really the same argument.
QUESTION:

Well, is it quite the same?

Did he

not make an initial affirmative waiver of any desire to

have asylum or deportation?

Yes, he did.

He deliberately and

Attorney General could properly find that Mr. Doherty's

2

interests in sanctuary in the United States were not

paramount, even if he was potentially going to be

subjected to persecution in the United Kingdom.

the national interest in foreign policy and leadership in

least that he found it appropriate to exercise his

I would note that in this Court's decision in

made a prima facie case of persecution in Ghana, but

Despite the

1

fact that we had met the threshold that we had to meet,

2

the threshold that entitled us to a hearing, he went ahead

3

and made a determination as to the ultimate merit of our

claim without ever giving us an opportunity to in any way

Doherty's background.

Your Honor, absolutely, I do, when

11

the relief that is at stake is withholding of deportation.

12

certainly if there was another form of protection that was

14

here implicated.

15

withholding of deportation, that we did meet that

threshold, and that that form of protection is mandatory.

And for that reason, I think that we are in a

18

position where having been deprived any opportunity to put

19

forward our side of the case, that is an abuse of

20

discretion by the Attorney General.

21

QUESTION:

Did the Attorney General justify his

22

decision not to reopen under the withholding section just

23

on the ground that the threshold hadn't been met?

24

even if it had, he would make the determination under (a)

25

and (c) that the relief was not available?

Or that

I don't know

1

why you're so emphasizing the threshold, because it seems

2

to me the Attorney General prevails if he has discretion

3

to find that you have an insubstantial case under (a) or

4

(c) .

5

MS. PIKE:

Your Honor, I have to disagree on

6

that, because the fact of the matter is, is that once we

7

do meet the threshold, it really does become at the very

8

least an abuse of discretion to leap ahead and make the

9

ultimate determination as to relief that is mandatory

10

without affording us a hearing on this record.

Because

11

the very things that the Attorney General asserted as the

12

basis on-which he premised his denial were the very acts

13

that were found by another factfinder in the basis of an

14

adversarial context where we did have an opportunity to

15

put forward evidence and contest them.

16

QUESTION:

That was in the extradition?

17

MS. PIKE:

That's right.

But of course, the

18

fact of the matter is, is that it is accepted that the

19

political offense exception is really the mirror image of

the nonpolitical crimes aspect of asylum law.

QUESTION:

And yet

Ms. Pike, can I just ask this

question?

9

is the Attorney General assuming that the facts stated and

In so far as the Attorney General relies on

10

developed in the extradition proceeding are all

11

correctly -- are all correct as in that proceeding, or is

12

he relying on some other record?

13

MS. PIKE:

Well, Your Honor, the answer to that

14

is -- the first part of your question is yes, he does

15

assume that those facts are correctly established in the

16

record.

17

QUESTION:

And you take the position those facts

18

are sufficient to establish the nonpolitical character of

19

the crime.

20

MS. PIKE:

We take that position, but our

21

alternative position, if you will, is that at the very

22

least, they entitle us to a hearing.

23

QUESTION:

But why isn't that record sufficient

24

to let a reviewing court decide as a matter of law whether

25

that subsection (c) is applicable or not?

MS. PIKE:

1

We think, Your Honor, that under the

2

circumstances as a matter of law, the decision cannot be

3

made because absent the additional facts that could be

4

adduced at the hearing, the proper balancing that is

5

required in terms of the determination of the entitlement

6

to that relief and possible exclusion from the protection

7

of that relief can't be made.

8

9

And it is clear from the handbook that construes
the convention and the protocol that the withholding of

10

deportation section is fashioned on, that that process is

11

absolutely central to the whole determination of claims

12

for withholding of deportation.

13

So absent our part of the equation, we are in

14

effect having a decision being made against us that does

15

not involve our part of the case.

16

QUESTION:

I understand.

17

MS. PIKE:

If I might continue, though, to

respond to what really was the second part of your

19

question as well.

20

Attorney General's decision here which your question

21

alluded to.

22

General accepts that the facts that he chose to rely on

from the extradition proceeding were correct, he admits in

24

his opinion that in effect, he does not have to find that

25

Joseph Doherty himself committed serious nonpolitical

There is a very curious aspect of the

And that is that although the Attorney

39

1

crimes, that it's adequate if he can find that the Irish

2

Republican Army committed serious nonpolitical crimes.

3

In effect, it is a tacit admission that there is

4

not in this record any evidence that Joseph Doherty

5

committed serious nonpolitical crimes.

6

is most compelling about this, and indeed most chilling,

7

is that the Attorney General ultimately bases his decision

8

on what he refers to as material that is exhaustively

9

documented -- that's his phrase, exhaustively documented,

And the thing that

10

in the record of another case, another immigration case

11

altogether to which we were not a party, and which did not

12

involve issues that were even remotely identical to the

13

issues in this case.

14

Consequently, we think to have relied on that

15

and to have made the determination, number one, without

16

letting us have a hearing, and then on the basis of facts

17

that are in another record altogether, really did deprive

18

us of any opportunity to establish entitlement.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Pike, if, however, the

20

Attorney General did not abuse his discretion in relying

21

on the waiver and denying the motion to reopen, I just

22

don't see how you get to those other reasons at all.

may have something valid to argue about there, to the

extent that we get into it, but I'm not sure we do.

MS. PIKE:

respond to that.

This notion that Mr. Doherty had

manipulated the system in a cynical or self-serving way I

think is absolutely incorrect, and I do not think the

record can be construed in that way.

The fact of the matter is that all that Mr.

circumstances reasonable.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Was it the Attorney General's

5

MS. PIKE:

Both are material for separate

reasons, but ultimately they dovetail.

7

8

possibility that Mr. Doherty would not be -- let me start

again.

What?

Mr. Meese's order

The significance of the Meese decision was that

11

it in effect ensured that Mr. Doherty was going to be

persecution.

14

filed the motion to reopen within 48 hours of the

15

implementation of the Extradition Act of 1987 because

16

under that act, Justice O'Connor, what we feared was

17

indirect return, but certain return to a country of

18

persecution.

19

That was the significance of it.

So both of those were absolutely material under

20

the reopening standards that the regulations set forth.

resolved at an evidentiary hearing.

11

The admissions that Mr. Doherty makes in his

12

extradition transcript establish that there simply are

13

serious reasons for the Attorney General to believe that

14

serious nonpolitical offenses were committed.

15

a hearing would serve no purpose, and that should not

16

require the Attorney General to reopen the proceeding.

17

Therefore,

In addition, I'd like to emphasize that the

18

Attorney General did rely on a broader range of conduct in

19

determining that serious nonpolitical offenses had been

20

committed than those relied upon by Judge Sprizzo.

21

Sprizzo focused very particularly on the basically the

22

murder of the British captain, and simply mentioned in

23

passing that no civilians were injured on May 2nd of 1980,

24

whereas the Attorney General focused specifically on the

motives not only through the killing of the British
captain, but also through deliberate acts of violence
directed at citizens of Northern Ireland on that day.
QUESTION:

It was the factual basis for that

conclusion, the record in the other case?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, that was in the

extradition hearing itself.

The facts surrounding the May

'80 events that Mr. Doherty admitted were that his group
hijacked a van, held the driver captive, forcibly seized a
private residence in a residential neighborhood, held the
family captive, and waged a gun battle with automatic
\

weapons from the family's living room.

The Attorney

General found that that conduct was precisely the type of
conduct that endangered innocent civilians and could
not -- and had to be regarded as serious nonpolitical
offenses.
I see my time is up.

Thank you.
