ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY R. PETERSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PETERSON:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the

10
11

Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to substitute

12

hearsay for the live testimony of a child witness, absent

13

a showing that the child is unavailable to testify at

14

trial.
The issue arose in this case at the defendant's

15
16

trial on the charges of sexual assault and other related

17

offenses.

at the time of trial, did not testify.

Instead, the prosecution relied upon hearsay

accusations against the accused.

This case presents conflicting considerations.

1

2

On the one hand, it is the defendant's constitutional

3

right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.

4

The defendant's convictions were premised on the

5

out-of-court accusations of a single witness.
Because the child did not testify, the defendant

6

7

did not have an opportunity to cross-examine his only

8

accuser.
QUESTION:

9

These two declarations were both

10

admitted by the Illinois courts under what?

11

considered, one set was a spontaneous declaration, and the

12

other was statements made by while submitting yourself for

13

a medical examination?

However, since our adversary system expresses a

22

strong preference for confrontation at trial, this Court

23

has held that competing interests must be closely

examined, and any exception to the confrontation right

25

must be narrowly construed.

Mr. Peterson, I understand that in

this case the child victim was actually in the courtroom.
MR. PETERSON:

That's right, Your Honor.

right to call witnesses as if under cross-examination.

The defendant moved for a mistrial based upon the

fact that the child did not testify.

The waiver argument

was presented to the Illinois appellate court and the
Illinois appellate court found it necessary to reach the
constitutional issue in what, I must say, is a very
forceful opinion.

That constitutional opinion is now the

law in the State of Illinois, and it's persuasive
authority in other jurisdictions as well.
And I submit, it is the constitutional issue
that is now presented here.

It must be remembered that

I can guess, but I don't know why.

What should the State have done that it did not

What exactly did you want the State

MR. PETERSON:

Your Honor, the predicate for

15

establishing the admissibility of hearsay evidence under

16

these circumstances is prior to introducing the evidence,

17

the State must either establish that the child is

18

unavailable or elicit that child's testimony from the

19

stand.

20

What we suggest the State should have done is to

21

prior to introducing this evidence, requested a hearing

22

and presented evidence on the issue of unavailability so

23

the trial court could make a finding', at which point the

24

record would clearly show one way or the other if the

25

child was available to testify or not.

MR. PETERSON:

QUESTION:

*

And the State has no option?

MR. PETERSON:

The Confrontation Clause requires

that the prosecution produce the witnesses against the

10

defendant, and I suggest that means that they produce the

11

testimony of those witnesses.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Peterson, you are assuming that

13

even though there is a well-recognized exception to the

14

hearsay rule and the law of evidence, nonetheless, the

15

Confrontation Clause requires that the witness speak from

16

the stand.

Certainly in Inadi, we would held that was not

18

MR. PETERSON:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So that is one place where the

20

Government would not have to show that they are

21

unavailable.

MR. PETERSON:

QUESTION:

wants to offer hearsay, they have to show either that the

1

QUESTION:

Right.

2

MR. PETERSON:

And in Craig, even though the

3

child was under oath and subject to cross-examination,

4

this Court nevertheless held that the procedure infringed

5

upon the defendant's confrontation right because he was

6

denied the opportunity to personally face his accuser, and

7

this Court held that, this exception to the confrontation

8

right could be justified only upon a case-specific finding
of necessity.
QUESTION:

10

I am still not sure,how you answer

11

the Chief Justice's question, and how you would

12

distinguish Inadi because here -- this case, it seems to

13

me is closer to Inadi because we have a well-recognized,

14

firmly-rooted hearsay exception, and Inadi makes it quite

15

clear that unavailability is not a requisite.

16
17

So are you saying that we should cut back on
Inadi somehow?
MR. PETERSON:

18

No.

In Inadi, this Court

1

balanced the competing interests, but the competing

20

interests in that case were much different.

21

with the testimony of a coconspirator.

22

coconspirator is often antagonistic to the prosecution.

23

Because he is often facing indictment himself, he is

24

likely to lie under oath in an attempt to save his own

25

skin.

Inadi dealt

Mr. Peterson, don't you have similar

reasons at stake here?

Isn't it more likely that the

14

MR. PETERSON:

15

QUESTION:

Generally --

I think the justification for both of

16

those hearsay exceptions would be that those statements

17

are more likely to be true than anything that would be

18

produced in the courtroom.

19

MR. PETERSON:

Certainly the hearsay rule

recognizes that these exceptions, hearsay is more reliable

than hearsay generally.

the best evidence.

MR. PETERSON:

He could call the child under the

rights.

which requires that the defendant be confronted with the

There is compulsory process for calling witnesses

MR. PETERSON:

In dealing with business records and some other

15

Well, but they go back a long way,

16

still wouldn't fall within that.

17

MR. PETERSON:

Well, in essence, an exception

18

to the hearsay rule is similar to testimony that comes

19

under oath because they are both considered reliable.

20

in this case, we say affidavits can't be relied upon, but

21

yet here we have unsworn verbal hearsay that is being

22

relied upon to obtain the defendant's conviction.

that anything that somebody says outside of court which is
used against you at a trial renders that person a witness

The defendant could only do it during

MR. PETERSON:

QUESTION:

That's right.

I see.

So that if you wanted to file

7

a motion for acquittal in the close of the prosecution's

8

case, you would not have had an opportunity to

9

cross-examine the child at that point.

10

MR. PETERSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

11

of course, the logical extension of such a procedure where

12

the defendant is not permitted to call the witness until

13

his case would be the prosecution could put on the direct

14

testimony of all of its witnesses and prevent the

15

defendant an opportunity of cross-examining any witnesses

16

until his case in chief.

And such a procedure would certainly be unfair,
and I suggest violate the Constitution.
For these reasons, I would ask this Court to

the Court's reasoning in United States v. Inadi applies to

6

this case as well.

7

of necessity laid out by the court in Maryland v. Craig is

8

applicable to this case, and we submit that its reliance

9

on Craig is misplaced.

The petitioner proposes that the rule

Craig involved a procedure used by the State

10
11

which was intended solely to replace in-court testimony,

12

so as to avoid live, face-to-face confrontation with the

13

defendant.

14

And it makes sense that a rule of necessity

15

would apply in a situation like that, and the Court has in

16

fact held that a rule of necessity does apply to hearsay

17

which is intended solely to replace live, in-court

18

testimony and specifically that is former testimony.

19

But most admissible hearsay is not simply a

20

substitute for live testimony. It has independent

21

probative value which is derived from the circumstances

22

under which is it made.

23

For example, let's look first at spontaneous

24

declarations.

4

With respect to statements made for purposes of

5

medical treatment or diagnosis, a person speaks

6

differently when consulting a doctor for treatment or

7

diagnostic purposes than when testifying on the stand, and

8

those statements also are irreplaceable as substantive

9

evidence.

QUESTION:

Do you think that is as true of a

11

5-year-old child, Ms. Anderson, as it would be of an adult

12

making a statement to a doctor in the course of getting

13

treatment?

MS. ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that

15

a child, even at a young age such as 4 or 5, understands

16

that when he or she is going to the doctor they are going

17

to an authority figure and that they are going for a

18

certain reason, that is, to obtain help.

19

The Court has under the Confrontation Clause put

20

some restrictions on this particular type of hearsay that

21

does have independent probative value, and mainly the

22

Court has focused on the reliability of the statement, and

23

the effect that any cross-examination might have.

That is correct, Your Honor.

Can we draw any inference from that,

that the unavailability could not be shown?

7

MS. ANDERSON:

No, I don't think that is the

case.

I think that the prosecution just decided that they

had statements that were squarely within these particular

exceptions and didn't feel that it had to resort to

probably bring the reliability of the statement into

11

your response to the same question I asked Mr. Peterson.

12

If you acknowledge that the child, when making these

13

declarations to the policeman or to the physician or

14

whoever, is a witness, where do we get the authority to

15

allow that to come in so long as it is reliable, since as

16

I read the Constitution, you are entitled to be confronted

17

with the witnesses against you, unless of course the

18

witnesses are reliable, in which case, you are not

19

entitled to be confronted.

20

Where do we get the authority?

21

MS. ANDERSON:

It is just based on prior case

22

law, Your Honor.

And the State of Illinois assumes for

23

purposes of argument today that there is some sort of a

24

reliability requirement that is derived from the

25

Confrontation Clause.

A literal reading of the Confrontation Clause,

1

2

as you are speaking about, would call into question

3

whether or not S.G. was actually a witness for purposes of

4

the Confrontation Clause, and the State of Illinois

5

probably -- if we weren't taking the position of assuming

6

that she was a witness - - would probably agree with you

7

that there is a question there as to whether the

8

Confrontation Clause does actually apply to a hearsay

declarant.
QUESTION:

10

It is not just reliability.

that there is even cross-examination where that memory is

If I could just go on, this Court has

specifically held that once reliability is shown with a

firmly-rooted exception or particularized guarantees of

17

trustworthiness are found, that statement -- it's

sufficiently clear that that statement is trustworthy

enough that cross-examination would probably be of

20

marginal utility.
Now if that's the case and these hearsay

22

statements are going to come in, what would be the purpose

of a blanket rule requiring the State to produce the

declarant each and every time it wants to admit a hearsay

If the prosecution

10

want to make it clear that the prosecution will by and

11

large call a complaining witness or an eyewitness to help

12

prove its case, but there are going to be certain

13

circumstances where the State may feel that the witness

14

would not be exceptionally effective, or in the case of

15

small children, possibly the prosecutor would want to keep

16

the child from being put in a traumatic situation.

17

And if that is the case, but the defendant still

18

feels that he needs to call this witness, he can certainly

19

do so under the Compulsory Process Clause.

20

submits that these cases where the State does decide not

21

to call a complaining witness or a victim as in this case,

22

and the defendant does feel that the testimony will be of

23

some value to him, those cases are so small, so small in

number that it doesn't justify changing the law as it now

it decides to enter one of these statements into evidence.

3

Finally, I would like to make one last point,

4

the defendant enough protection if he decided that he did

QUESTION:

It demonstrates

How is that relevant to the

Confrontation Clause issue?
MS. ANDERSON:

It is relevant in the sense that

the defendant is -- it's implying that the State is trying

11

to get in certain evidence, hearsay statements of this

12

kind just to avoid putting these witnesses on the stand,

13

and that's not the case.

17

Thank you, Ms. Anderson.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Federal Government's submission in essence

18

is that this case is indistinguishable in every meaningful

19

sense from Inadi.

20

necessity that the Court had outlined in Ohio v. Roberts

21

is reserved for the situation in which the Government

22

attempts to admit hearsay which is essentially a

23

less-desirable substitute for live testimony, and that

24

rationale is just as inapplicable to the statements before

25

the Court today as it was to the coconspirator statements

2

involved in Inadi.
The decisive feature of the statements involved

3

in Inadi, the Court said, was that they were made in a

4

context very different from trial which gave them special

5

evidentiary significance, and the same can fairly be said

6

of the two hearsay exceptions before the Court today.

7

State and Federal rules of evidence firstly

8

provide for the admission of excited utterances.

After

9

many years of experience with those sorts of statements, a

10

consensus has emerged that statements made while a person

11

remains under the emotional influence of a startling event

12

have special reliability.

13

Those statements are made at a point when the

14

person's memory is as clear as it will ever be, and before

15

there has been an opportunity for conscious revision or

16

external influence.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Nightingale, what about the

18

statement that was made 45 minutes later to the policeman.

19

Suppose it had been 3 days later or whatever scenario you

20

might imagine.

21

perhaps excited utterance exceptions shouldn't cover it,

22

but that is a matter of State law.

23
24
25

At some point, I guess, one could say that

How do you deal with that in the context of the
Confrontation Clause challenge?
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

At some point, certainly, a

1

State court finding that a statement was an excited

2

utterance would take it so far beyond the accepted core

3

definition of that hearsay exception that it could no

4

longer be regarded as firmly-rooted.

5

The Court has dealt with similar situations, for

6

instance, in Dutton v. Evans where a State was admitting

7

coconspirator statements that were not in furtherance of

8

the conspiracy, but rather during the so-called

9

concealment phase of the conspiracy.

10

There was also, actually the name of the case

11

escapes me right now, but the point is that if a State

12

application of a hearsay exception takes it outside the

13

accepted firmly-rooted definition, then the Court could

14

appropriately consider the particular application.

15

QUESTION:

And I suppose there is some question

16

here about statements of a very young child to a doctor.

2

Do you think that is true of a child

of, let's say, 2 years of age?

3

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

when - - when the child is incapable of perhaps making a

reliable statement, but certainly that is not the case

here.

8

beginning at a point when they are days old and

And I think that a child of very young

continuously, and I think by 2 years old, most children
10
11

recognize the role that the doctor plays in their lives.
I would like to return briefly to the police

12

officer statements, statements to the police officer here.

13

I don't think that there is any indication that that, the

14

admission of those statements was in any way outside the

15

mainstream of excited utterances.

16

QUESTION:

As I see it, as the case comes here,

17

we judge it on the basis that all these statements were

18

within some recognized hearsay exception because

that -- that is, the case isn't challenged.

20

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

I agree with Your Honor, and

21

not only that, within the core of the accepted hearsay

22

exceptions there was evidence here that the child had been

24

she had been restrained in a way that caused, injuries to

The real question, to get to the

So there is an evolving definition of

I thought it was the Government's

position that this material is not really covered by the
Confrontation Clause anyway.
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Are you abandoning that?
No.

It's our position that

12

the case can be decided within the framework of Inadi and

13

in addition, we think that this case presents the Court

14

with an opportunity, if it's inclined to do so, to

15

consider whether every out-of-court hearsay declarant is

16

in fact a witness.

17

It is our position that the language of the

18

clause and the historical context from which it emerges

19

supports the view that it was designed essentially to

20

prevent the occurrence of an abuse that had characterized

21

some notorious English trials.

So this is really an independent

argument from the line of reasoning you were pursuing with

Justice Stevens?

That's true.

formulation, I take it we would render irrelevant much of

the analysis in Inadi and Green?
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Green, no, because I think

10

Green involved out-of-court statements that were prior

testimony and statements to authorities in a legal

context.

threshold question would be, were the statements made the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY R. PETERSON

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. PETERSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

16

I would like to respond again to the suggestion

17

that the child was not a witness against the accused.

18

Under the Solicitor General's approach, someone is a

19

witness against the accused if they give testimony or they

20

give statements in contemplation of litigation.

21

And I would suggest, even under that approach,

22

the child in this case was a witness against the accused.

23

A police officer interviewed the child 45 minutes after

24

the alleged incident.

25

aware than an allegation of a crime had been made.

At that time the police officer was

The child at this point was no longer excited,

2

and the police officer testified that she was calm.

He

3

asked the child leading questions and she responded.

I

4

would suggest that these statements fit the definition of

5

being made in contemplation of litigation.

6

In addition, last year in Idaho v. Wright, this

7

Court applied Confrontation Clause analysis to almost the

8

exact situation we have here, statements by a child to an

9

examining physician.

10

In this case --

11

QUESTION:

12

Excuse me, you think the child was

contemplating litigation?

13

MR. PETERSON:

14

QUESTION:

No.

I mean, when you say, when the

15

Government says in contemplation of litigation, I think it

16

means to say that the declarant is contemplating

17

litigation, and so it is at a deposition, the declarant

18

knows the deposition is going to be used in later

19

litigation or something of that sort.

20
21

22

There is no question here that the declarant was
not contemplating litigation, is there?
MR. PETERSON:

I would agree with that, and

23

under that approach, I would suppose that a child would

24

never be considered a witness against the accused, as

25

children -- most of their statements, I would suggest, may

never contemplate that they will be made in contemplation

3

And I would also note, and in this case the

4

doctor who interviewed the child testified that he took

5

notes in contemplation of litigation, that is at volume 6,

page 63 of the record.

7

There has also been much discussion about the

inherent reliability of the statements admitted in this

case.
