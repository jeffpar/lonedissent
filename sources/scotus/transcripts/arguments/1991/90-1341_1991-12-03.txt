We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS/CROSS -RESPONDENTS
MR. FELDMAN:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

This, a case -- this case arises from a suit by

13

the State of Ohio against the United States Department of

14

Energy, concerning the operation of DOE'S Fernald, Ohio

15

uranium processing plant.

16

Now, all aspects of the case have been settled,

17

other than the State's claim for State and Federal civil

18

penalties.

19

issue before the Court is solely whether civil penalties

20

are available against the Federal Government under four

21

specific provisions of the Clean Water Act and the

22

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, RCRA.

23

Thus, as the case comes to this Court, the

Now it's our position that the provisions are

24

most reasonably interpreted not to waive sovereign

25

immunity as to civil penalties.

But the issue in the case

is not whether we can show that those provisions mean what

2

they say they do.

3

waiver of sovereign immunity, whether the State can show

4

that Congress clearly and unambiguously, in the language

5

of these statutes, waived sovereign immunity from civil

6

penalties.

7

The issue is, because this involves a

Now that, that is based on the well-settled rule

8

that it is up to the State to prove - - to show that a

9

waiver exists, that any doubts concerning whether there's

10

a waiver should be resolved against finding a waiver of

11

sovereign immunity, and that a waiver of sovereign

12

immunity must be clear and unambiguous.

13

Congress was well aware of those principles at

14

the time when the provisions at issue here were enacted.

15

Indeed, the key provisions, which are the Federal

16

facilities provisions of the Clean Water Act and of RCRA,

17

were enacted within a year or so after this Court's

18

decisions in Hancock against Train and EPA against

19

California, which specifically rested on the clear

20

statement principle.

21

Indeed, Congress must have been aware of that

22

principle.

23

language of the statutes at issue, it's impossible to find

24

a clear and unambiguous waiver under those standards.

25

And I think if we -- if you look at the

1

two features of the case that suggest that that clear

2

statement rule has to be applied with particular rigor.

3

First, there's the long-settled understanding that where

4

an asserted waiver of sovereign immunity would upset the

5

delicate Federal-State balance, and in particular, where

6

it subjects the Federal Government to regulation by

7

States, it's particularly appropriate to apply the clear

8

statement rule.

9

here.

10

And that is -- that would be the case

Secondly, where an asserted waiver of sovereign

11

immunity would have an effect on the Federal -- and

12

perhaps more important where an asserted waiver of

13

sovereign immunity is penal in nature, the Court has also

14

applied the clear statement rule with particular rigor.

15

Perhaps the case that's most closely on point is Missouri

16

Pacific Railroad --

17

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you, Mr. Feldman,

18

because there is one sentence in the statute that does

19

seem rather clear.

20

on page 58 of your opinion -- the United States shall be

21

liable only for those civil penalties arising under

22

Federal law.

Now, in any case, it must arise under

23

Federal law.

But can you not -- can that any way possibly

24

be interpreted to say there's no case in the world in

25

which the United States shall be liable for a civil

MR. FELDMAN:

That language would apply to civil

could be called civil penalties that are imposed as

8

result of the Federal Government's failure to comply with

9

an injunction that was issued under the statute.

But that

10

language itself is not the language of waiver.

It's a

11

language of limitation.

12

language itself doesn't waive sovereign immunity.

So we would submit that that

And if you look at the earlier language, earlier

14

in the same provision -- I might refer you to page 1(a) of

15

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, earlier in the same section.

And it would -- it's our understanding of the provision

that the waiver is in the earlier part of that statute.

6

And that waiver limits financial penalties to those

QUESTION:

State or local court?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

4

QUESTION:

By State or local court, right.

But it does seem odd that if they

5

meant simply pay civil contempt penalties imposed by a

6

Federal, State, or local court, they would word the

7

sentence this way.
They talk about penalties arising under Federal

8

9

law.

And you're saying that should be read as if it meant

10

penalties imposed by Federal courts for failing to obey an

11

injunction.
MR. FELDMAN:

12

That is the only -- those are the

13

only kind of penalties that would otherwise be provided by

14

the Act -- or the only kind of penalties that could be

15

assessed against the Federal Government, and that could be

16

applied.

MR. FELDMAN:

I'm not sure that that's right,

although that issue isn't presented by this case.

waives Federal immunity from --if you look at the prior

This talks about relief against the

MR. FELDMAN:

For instance, no one's argued that

you could obtain a civil penalty against the administrator

by virtue of that reference to 1319(d).

17

In other words, where the suit is brought

against the administrator, all that this provision is

doing in the citizens suit provision is preserving

whatever remedies are otherwise applicable in citizens

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, it was a case that arose

And Congress had passed a statute providing that

10

the Federalized rail carriers are subject to - - I think

11

the quote is all laws and liabilities as common carriers,

12

which is a very broad waiver provision, I think arguably

13

broader than any of the waiver provisions that you find

14

here -- that you find here in the earlier part of 1323 at

15

least.

16

The Court held that although that provision

17

subjecting the United States to all laws and liabilities

18

did subject the United States to compensatory remedies, it

did not extend to penal measures.

5

I think we have to go back to the discussion

6

that Mr. Feldman and Justice Stevens had at the beginning

7

of that dialogue concerning the phrase arising under

8

Federal law, and how that relates to the definition of

9

person in the citizens suit provision.
Under the Department's interpretation, not only

10
11

can citizens not file a suit for civil penalties against

12

the Federal Government, but even EPA could not file a

13

lawsuit for civil penalties against the Federal

14

Government.

15

penalty action against the Federal Government under

16

Federal law, under the Department's interpretation.

Which means that no one can file a civil

And that negates the operation, according to the

Department -- of the phrase, civil penalties arising under

19

Federal law.

Now, civil penalties --

21

only penalties provided in Federal law right now are those

in 1319?

unambiguous.

vague and often self - contradictory terms.

MR. VAN KLEY:

We believe that the specific

waiver in the citizens suit provision is enough.

there is also another provision of waiver in 1323 which

works just as well, with respect to the Clean Water Act.

QUESTION:

However,

Well, if we thought 1323 did not

That would leave us with the

QUESTION:

2

3

Did it under that -- it did not deal

with that section at all?

4

MR. VAN KLEY:

That's correct.

It did not need

5

to reach that section because the stipulation of penalty

6

provides that the penalty payments will be made under

7

State law, if the court finds a State law waiver, and goes

8

to the Federal citizens suit penalties only if the court

9

fails to find a waiver under State law.
So as a result, the Sixth Circuit did not need

10
11

to reach the citizens suit issue with respect to the Clean

12

Water Act.

13

Now -QUESTION:

Do you agree, Mr. Van Kley, that

14

penalties under -- is it under 1365, the citizens suit,

15

are paid to the United States?

16

MR. VAN KLEY:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, we do agree.

Then doesn't it seem odd that the

18

United States would be sued and its penalty would be paid

19

to the United States?

20

MR. VAN KLEY:

No, Your Honor.

The main purpose

21

of a civil penalty is its deterrent effect.

22

effect from such a penalty comes from twofold -- first of

23

all, under some types of actions, the money would be taken

out of the DOE accounts, out of the DOE funds, and paid to

that civil penalties for which the United States would be

here, it clearly does include a contempt sanction if it's

1

part of that sentence to separately refer to the State and

2

local court contempt sanctions.

3

One thing that has to be emphasized with respect

4

to the State law programs is that EPA has basically been

5

told to keep its hands off of enforcement, as long as the

6

State is implementing its approved program.

7

USEPA has to give 30 days notice before the State, and

8

allow the State to enforce -- take advantage of the

9

situation and try to enforce first, before the Federal

10

Now, in fact,

Government can even act.

11

And the Congress has made it very clear that

12

USEPA's enforcement actions to get civil penalties and

13

other enforcement are to be the unusual exception; that

14

the States are primarily entrusted with the function of

15

enforcing this statute.

16

Therefore, it doesn't make much sense to try to

17

limit the statement made in this section to only those

18

civil penalties that have been assessed pursuant to the

19

citizens suit provision.

20

enforcement at all if that occurs.

21

There will be very little

And, in fact, if the State does not enforce,

22

that is grounds for USEPA to revoke its program.

23

option is not even left open for the State to allow EPA to

24

take all the enforcement against the many Federal

facilities that exist in this country.

You -- just to get a different scale

of penalties, is that the reason for the difference?

No, we rely on the citizens suit

Is that right?

MR. VAN KLEY:

No, the difference is simply

QUESTION:

But may I just put one -- there are

two rather separate theories under the Clean Water Act.

Is there a difference in the outcome of

MR. VAN KLEY:

Yes, there -- the only

8

difference, Your Honor, is where the money goes, whether

9

the money goes to the State treasury or the Federal

11

12

13

Government.
QUESTION:

I see, so that's why you're not

arguing the citizens suit provision very vigorously.
MR. VAN KLEY:

There's two reasons.

That's one

14

reason, because we think the deterrence is more effective

15

if the money goes to State law, State court.

16
17

QUESTION:

And you don't get the money.

I

understand that.

(Laughter.)

MR. VAN KLEY:

Well, Your Honor, actually, ah,

there's a lot easier ways to earn $250,000 than to file a

suit like this.

We definitely do not bring these suits as

concentrated your argument on this, rather than the other.

MR. VAN KLEY:

QUESTION:

It seems to me if one looks at plain

language you've got a much stronger argument on the other.

I don't know whether you're right or not, but surely the

5

waiver is much more clear in the citizens suit --

6

QUESTION:

Well, I thought maybe you wanted to

7

enforce this law and sue under the citizens suit provision

8

and recover those Federal penalties because then you're

9

going to punish the agency by taking their money away and

giving it to somebody else in the Federal Government.

MR. VAN KLEY:

They could be higher as long as

2

they are consistent with Federal law.

approves those penalties.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. VAN KLEY:

Because USEPA

I see.
And, in fact, that's one more

6

reason why we believe that they do arise under Federal

7

law, is because they are part of a program which USEPA has

8

labelled requirements of the State enforcement programs.

9

And they are approved as part of the program.

10

And they

operate in lieu of Federal law.

11

And as I mentioned before, given the fact that

12

USEPA is not supposed to be enforcing the statute unless

13

the State falls down, it is much more likely that the

14

Federal Government wanted the State to take the lead

15

against the Federal agencies.

16

I would like to just briefly and quickly

17

distinguish the 1331 case law, although as I mentioned

18

before, we do not rely on this case law.

19

1331 arising under case law should not be used to

20

interpret arising under in the Clean Water Act because of

21

the different purposes of those statutes.

22

We believe that

However, under the Machinists case, the

23

Department of Energy has made the argument that it is

24

State law that - - in our case it is State law that is

25

providing the penalties, and therefore, even under 1331 it

1

can't arise under Federal law.

2

Well, Machinists tells us differently.

Because

3

in that case, it was a private contract, implementing the

4

purposes of Federal law that was deemed to be arising

5

under Federal law.
So the fact that the penalty actually is passed

6

7

as a State law, does not -- even under Federal question

8

jurisdiction -- detract from the fact that it arises under

9

Federal law.
Just one quick point about the administrator

10
11

being sued under the Clean Water Act citizens suit

12

provisions that I'd like to respond to.

13

can be sued under that section if, for example, an EPA

14

building would pollute the environment.

sense in the light of the fact that EPA, indeed, can be a

16

Federal agency violating the law just like any other

17

agency.

18

The administrator

And it does make

EPA has to obey the law as well.
With respect to the Ault case, we believe that

19

the case is dramatically different than the one here.

20

Although the waiver in the statutory text was extremely

21

broad in that case, the statutory text allowed the

22

President to pass an order -- enact an order which limited

23

the scope of that general waiver.

happened in that case.

The legislative history you can find in our

17

perhaps some plausibility to the view that they wanted to

make sure that whatever else had already been done, or had

19

already been waived in the statute, they wanted to be sure

that in any event, they wanted to cancel it if it didn't

they're in recess -- but they've recently enacted

amendments to the RCRA provision that's also at issue in
