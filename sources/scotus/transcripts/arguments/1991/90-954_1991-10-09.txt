ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHESTER A. JANIAK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
ROBERT C. RUFO, ET AL.

10

MR. JANIAK:

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

The issue in this case is what standard should

14

be applied to modify -- to resolve a disputed request to

15

modify a consent decree entered into by a public official

16

defendant.

17

In this case, we submit that a consent decree in

18

such a case should be modified if there has been a change

19

in circumstance since the entry of the consent degree that

20

is adversely affecting public interests or important

21

public institutions and if the consent decree may be

22

modified to avoid those adverse effects and still

23

vindicate the plaintiff's federally guaranteed rights.

24
25

In this case, the courts below failed to apply
such a standard, with two adverse effects.

First, the

1

sheriff of Suffolk County has been compelled, because of

2

the single-celling provision in the consent decree in this

3

case, to transfer inmates from the brand-new Suffolk

4

County Jail, which was opened in May of 1990, from that

5

facility into a State correctional system, which is now

6

operating at excess of 170 cent -- 170 percent of

7

capacity.
These inmates are transferred from that brand-

8

9

new facility into a State system, where, ironically, they

10

are often double- or triple-bunked or, in some instances,

11

compelled to sleep on the floors of those institutions.
These transfers are made pursuant to a State

12

13

statute which requires the agreement and consent of the

14

sheriff and the commissioner of correction to make such

15

transfers.

16

These transfers would not be made by the sheriff

17

or the commissioner of correction except for the consent

18

decree entered in this case.

19

commissioner of correction agree that they are not

20

correctionally sound and have interfered with the

21

operation of the over-burdened State correctional system

22

by placing additional pre-trial detainees into that

23

system; and in addition, it required Suffolk County to

24

expend an additional $1 million a year in transporting

25

inmates from the Suffolk County Jail to these State

They -- the sheriff and the

correctional facilities.
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us how many of

these transfers there are?
MR. JANIAK:

I think we could compute.

The

record doesn't say it directly, Justice, but it would be
apparent from simply taking the daily count statistics,
which are in the record, and we know what the capacity was
at the facility -- you'd have a given point in time.

They

number, literally, at this point, in the thousands.
QUESTION:
MR. JANIAK:

Thousands?
Yes, there would be - - there would

be - QUESTION:

And would the change in the consent

decree that you're asking for totally eliminate these
transfers?
MR. JANIAK:
eliminate it.

They most probably would totally

Because what we've asked for, is we

have -- in the new facility, which opened in May of 1990,
we have 419 cells for male inmates.
double-bunk 197 of them.

We've asked to

Given our count statistics, it

is highly unlikely we would ever exceed --go beyond the
197 that we intend to double-bunk.

That is, our counts

typically have been lately run -- typically run in the
area of 480 inmates, where we have only 419 cells.
are occasions where we've exceeded 500.

There

So this would

1

most probably result in a complete cure of this problem.
The second adverse effect, the keeping this

2

3

consent decree in place, has been on the functioning of

4

the State bail statute.

5

sheriff does not have a sufficient number of inmates who

6

qualify for transfer to a State correctional facility.

7

Because under State law, the only persons who may be

8

transferred are pre-trial detainees who have served a

9

prior State felony sentence.

There are occasions where the

If those types of inmates are not available, and

10
11

the sheriff still has more inmates than 419 cells at the

12

jail, what he must do is then submit a list of names to a

13

superior court judge.

14

takes individuals who are being held on bail and reduces

15

them to release on recognizance, so that they may be

16

transferred to a half-way house facility, which is an

17

insecure facility, whereas the jail is a maximum security

18

facility.

19

And the superior court judge then

Those individuals, the record shows, 10 to 15

20

percent of those individuals then walk away from that

21

facility.

22

judge of the courts in Suffolk County -- and in most

23

instances two judges -- have adjudicated as persons for

24

whom the setting of bail is necessary to ensure their

25

appearance at trial.

These persons are persons who at least one

1
~

This is a second adverse effect of the court's

2

decision below because it is now interfering with the

3

functioning of the State bail statute in having

4

individuals released on recognizance who would not

5

otherwise qualify for that status.

6

It is these interferences with the

7

administration of the State correctional system, the

8

county pre-trial detention system, and the State bail

9

statute that the sheriff sought to avoid in this case when

10

he proposed to double-bunk 197 of the 400 -- 197 of the

11

435 cells at the Suffolk County Jail.

12

those cells, 34 of them are for female detainees.

13

The remainder of

When the sheriff made that proposal, he proposed

14

to - - leave in place, all of the remaining provisions of

15

the consent decree.

16

provided for the construction of a jail which far exceeds

17

constitutional requirements.

18

proposed to double-bunk, none of the other features of the

19

consent decree would be disturbed by the sheriff's

20

proposal for modification.

MR. JANIAK:

In some instances, in the small,

double-bunking.

MR. JANIAK:

The cells in the new facility would

11

be, in some instances, would be smaller than the cells in

12

the old facility.

13

However, the new facility differs very

14

significantly in other features of the design of the jail.

15

The new jail, for example, has only small, modular units,

16

so that in any unit, there is no more than 40 cells,

17

stacked in 2 tiers.

Yes, but I suppose -- your -- the

decree -- the court refused to set aside the decree based

23

on the standard that you attack.

QUESTION:

Correct.
Now, let's assume we agreed with you.

Nobody got around to -- below to deciding whether or not

2

double-bunking in this new facility would be a - - violate

3

the Eighth Amendment.

4

MR. JANIAK:

That's -- the judge below said he

5

did not have to reach any issue, and there are no

6

findings.

7

QUESTION:

What if we agreed with you, wouldn't

8

we just remand to have the Eighth Amendment issue fleshed

9

out in the court below?

10

MR. JANIAK:

I think the -- perhaps the most

11

appropriate result, then, would be to remand to apply a

12

new standard to make the determination of whether double-

13

bunking this particular facility --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. JANIAK:

16

Yes.
-- would meet constitutional

standards.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Janiak, do you plan to discuss

18

with us the standard employed below and the standard that

19

you think is applicable?

20

MR. JANIAK:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

21

the district court judge did was, first, apply the

22

standard in Swift.

23

not meet the standard in Swift, the district court judge

24

then purported to apply what he said was a flexible

25

standard.

After having found that this case did

applied was a new standard, which is quite unlike both the

2

standard that we've urged on this Court, and unlike the

3

standard that's been applied by -- in the various circuit

4

courts.

QUESTION:

Does rule 60(b)(5) have anything to

do with the authority of the court to consider a

modification?

MR. JANIAK:

I think the issue would be, given

Does the rule apply?
Yes.
So the question is whether it's

I think the question is what does

equitable mean in this particular kind of case.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. JANIAK:

Okay.
And the district court judge first

18

looked to the Swift case in answering that, which I submit

19

is not the proper standard, given this Court's decision in

20

the Dowell case, particularly, and then went on to apply

21

what he said was, quote,

22

"a flexible standard."

But I submit that what he, in fact, did in that

23

case was quite different, both from the standard that we

24

have urged on this Court, and quite different from what

25

any of the circuit courts have done, who've spoken of a

flexible standard.
QUESTION:

2

Does a consent decree have any

3

contractual aspects to it that are the source of special

4

concern?

5

MR. JANIAK:

I think that a consent decree has

6

a contractual aspect to it, but it should not be

7

considered a contract.

8

Justice Cardozo's decision in the Swift case, he says that

9

although a consent --a consent decree is an order of the

I think at least since this --

10

court and, therefore, is subject to later modification,

11

under the right circumstance -- leaving open the question

12

of what that would be, given the nature of this case.

13

With respect to there being some consensual

14

aspect to it, I think that's accommodated by the standard

15

that we've urged on this Court.

16

what we have said is that there must be a change in

17

circumstance, producing an adverse effect.

18

that there must be a change in circumstance, and that must

19

be shown, a public official defendant cannot then go back

20

and simply say I've changed my mind.

21

proposal accommodates the consensual aspect of consent

22

decrees.

Because what -- because

And by saying

So I think that our

QUESTION:

Is that --

1

consent decree, an obligation that's greater than the

2

Constitution commands?

3

MR. JANIAK:

I think, given this Court's holding

4

in the Local 93 case, that is probably correct, that they

5

would have -- if the parties agree to it, and it goes

6

beyond what the court could have ordered after trial, it

7

may be entered as a consent decree.

8

9

I think that the issue presented in this case is
a different issue, which is given that that has happened,

10

what -- what is the standard to be applied later, when the

11

parties come back before the court, and there's a disputed

12

request to modify a consent decree.

13

QUESTION:

Would it be an abuse of the

14

discretion for the district court to say I'll do no more

15

than the constitutional minimum?

16

MR. JANIAK:

I think that -- in fact, what the

17

court would be required to do is to look to the underlying

18

Federal law which occasion the court's original

19

intervention --

20

QUESTION:

I mean at the outset of the decree.

21

Suppose the court, at the outset of the decree,

22

said I will enter no decree that - - exceeds the

23

constitutional minimum.

24
25

MR. JANIAK:
that discretion.

I believe that the court would have

1

QUESTION:

Well, it may be --

2

QUESTION:

It would be an abuse of discretion to

3

enter a decree that would order a State to do more than

4

the Constitution required, whether consent or not.

5

do you think of that?

6

MR. JANIAK:

What

Well, I think that's a tough

7

question, given this Court's -- and which -- I'm sure

8

that's why it was asked, Justice White.

9

I think that's a difficult question, given

10

it's -- it is my understanding of this Court's decision in

11

Local 93, where there was a decree entered which went

12

beyond what the court could have ordered in that case.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JANIAK:

Was that a constitutional case?
That was not a constitutional case.

15

That was a title VII case.

It may be that a

16

constitutional case presents a somewhat different issue.

17

What we've urged - -

18

QUESTION:

I suppose a district court can -- if

19

he thinks he's -- there's really a constitutional

20

violation involved, can spell out what he thinks might be

21

an appropriate remedy, and especially if it's consented

22

to, he could enter the order.

23

But it still has to be, at root, a

24

constitutional violation that he's purporting to enter an

25

order about.

MR. JANIAK:

1

That's correct.

There has to be

2

some Federal violation of the Federal Constitution, or

3

Federal law, which brought the parties before the court

4

initially.

5

contain remedies go beyond the minimum - - go beyond what

6

is required in order to vindicate those federally

7

guaranteed rights.
QUESTION:

8

9

Then the question is, does the consent decree

Mr. Janiak, can I ask you a question

about your standard on the changed circumstances?

In your

10

view, must those changed circumstances be unforeseen

11

changed circumstances?
MR. JANIAK:

12

I think my -- in my view, they

13

don't have to be foreseeable.

14

QUESTION:

It would be all right if everybody

15

could predict the increase in prison population, and then

16

they still -- you could still rely on that increase to do

17

it.

18

the district judge found that circumstances were not

19

unforeseen, didn't he?

20

That's critical to your case, I guess,

MR. JANIAK:

'cause here

Well, what the district court judge

21

did here, Justice Stevens, he looked --he discussed the

22

issue of foreseeability only in the context of applying

23

the Swift standard.

24

standard which is really different than any foreseeability

25

standard to which any public official should be held.

And then I think discuss -- applied a

Because what he did is he conceded, initially,

1

2

that the phenomenon of increases in jail and prison

3

populations are unpredictable.

4

was dealing with an unpredictable phenomenon, he then

5

spoke of what was at - - what he found to be an apparent

6

trend, looking back in April of 1990, to 1985.

7

that basis, said, well, it wasn't unforeseen.

And on

That seems to me to be a very, tight standard to

Having conceded that he

You tell me that you're

10

going to talk about apparent trends with respect to

11

unpredictable phenomena.

12

coming, then I'm going to hold you to the original

13

agreement.

14

QUESTION:

And if you don't foresee this

But it seems to me your standard has

15

the same problem in it.

16

relief that you ask for and then the prison population

17

continues to grow -- as it no doubt will, with so many

18

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

The commissioner of corrections agrees with the

15

sheriff that the district court should have modified the

16

consent decree, due to changed circumstances.

17

maintain that there is another, more fundamental basis for

18

reversal of the district court.

19

But we

We submit that with the closing of the old jail

20

and the opening of the new jail, it was no longer

21

appropriate for the district court to continue to exercise

22

equitable authority over double-celling under the consent

23

decree.

24
25

The new facility contained no vestiges, if you
will, of the unconstitutional conditions at the old jail.

And it eliminated any risk of a recurrence of the

2

conditions that offended the Fourteenth Amendment.

3

That being so, under the general, equitable

4

principles applied by this Court most recently in Board of

5

Education v. Dowell, last term, we maintain that the

6

district court should have concluded that the consent

7

decree's restrictions on double-bunking could have no

8

further, prospective application under rule 60(b)(5).
The Federal Court had played its role.

9

It had

10

succeeded in fully protecting constitutional values, and

11

the time to end judicial tutelage over this jail had come

12

to an end.

standards.

point -- which we concede is difficult to define in many

2

cases -- the power of the court ends, no matter what the

3

consent decree says.

4

QUESTION:

Then under those -- under your rule,

5

there doesn't have to be any changed circumstance.

6

constitutional violation is remedied, and you can walk

7

back into court the next morning and say, well it's true.

8

We promised by the consent decree to do something more

9

than the Constitution requires, but we now are under no

11

The

obligation to do so and the court can't make us do it.
That reads the - - that reads the consensual

12

aspect of the consent decree, in effect, right out of it,

13

doesn't it?

14

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Your Honor, we really make

15

here -- in this case -- two arguments.

We agree with the

16

sheriff that there are circumstances when the court must

17

apply equitable principles to determine whether a

18

modification is appropriate because of changed

19

circumstances.

20

But we speak here, on the facts of this case, of

21

the absolute limits that we think this Court should impose

22

on the court's equitable authority.

MR. MONTGOMERY:

2

3

We do not go that far, Your

Honor.

4

If the parties agree to a consent decree that is

5

entered by the court which contains an element - - for

6

example, in this case, double-bunking -- which purportedly

7

exceeds constitutional standards, we read Local 93 to

8

permit the court to enter such a consent decree without a

9

searching inquiry into whether every single provision in

10

the decree falls within constitutional standards.
Until there are changed circumstances, there is

11
12

no basis for a modification.

13

basis, in our view, for the argument we make here, that is

14

that the equitable authority of the court has come to an

15

end until the constitutional violations that led to the

16

decree have been cured - - and a showing can be made that

17

they are unlikely to recur.

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Your Honor, the question is the

13

context on which the assessment is made of whether there

14

isn't -- some violation of the law that occurs.

15

We maintain that the court below ought not to

16

address the double-celling question under the consent

17

decree -- because, as I've said, the limits of the court's

18

equitable authority had come to an end -- but rather, as a

19

fresh complaint.

20

In this case, the inmates' complaint about the

21

sheriff's plan to double-cell in the future, is like the

22

student reassignment plan in Dowell.

cannot show that there are remaining vestiges of de jures

2

discrimination, and cannot show that there is now threat

3

of recurrence, then -- or excuse me, if they can show

4

that, then the student reassignment plan can be challenged

5

only under a fresh complaint.
What we say here is not that the plaintiff

6

7

should be deprived of an opportunity to challenge double-

8

celling at the new jail, but that they should do so only

9

on a fresh complaint and under the standards of the

10

Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what if, in the showing in

12

the -- for the original decree, Mr. Montgomery, it was

13

shown that this sheriff had been sheriff of three or four

14

different jails, and in every one of them he double-

15

celled.

16

indeed, it isn't just the building in which he's in, he

17

just has a propensity to double-cell people.

18

do so in the new building, too.

19

It seems to me that the court could then say,

MR. MONTGOMERY:

He's apt to

If the court had believed, in

20

1973 when it entered its original decision after trial

21

that single-celling was, per se, a violation of the

22

Constitution, and such a sheriff were a party to the case,

23

then I would agree with Your Honor's suggestion that it

24

would be difficult to show that there was no a likelihood

25

of recurrence.

authority to enter relief pursuant to a consent decree

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Under Local 93, there certainly

is an argument to be made that there is some greater

16

On the other hand, we think there is no

suggestion in this court's treatment of general, equitable

ultimate authority.

There is no difference, for example, between the

We believe that under this

that when the past violations are permanently cured - - and

local officials will now be held accountable, not to the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STERN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The question presented is what standard should

have governed Judge Keeton's exercise of discretion when

10

he considered a 1989 motion to modify an order requiring

11

single occupancy which had been entered in 1979 and then

12

modified and reaffirmed explicitly in 1985.

13

The 19 79â consent decree was entered after this

14

case had been pending since 1971, after a 1973 finding of

15

violation, and an order to close the jail.

16

a complete impasse had been developed and no remedy had

17

been supplied or was even proposed by the defendants.

The question was, then, how to get out of this

close unless the defendants are prepare to commit in an

enforceable way to the specifics of a plan -- that is, a

jail, a site, specific criteria, and so forth.

which became the consent decree of 1979 which required

2

single occupancy.
And then, again, in April of 1985 that, a new

order was entered which was entered in light of the fact

that the population had been rising and was likely to

continue to rise.

Well, perhaps not.

But in any

event, we agree with the Solicitor General that there must

enough to make a consent decree worth entering.

16

bargain, if they are not guaranteed something beyond re-

litigation in the future, then nobody will enter a consent

decree.

then it makes no difference in this case whether the Swift

First of all --

MR. STERN:

That was the deal.
-- that was the deal.

Bell v.

we signed that consent decree.

QUESTION:

Everybody --

But you did not know who was going to

win.
MR. STERN:

18

Of course.

That was exactly the

19

point.

Everybody decided to finesse, everybody decided to

20

hedge their bets and make this deal.
And Bell was decided -- 7 days after the consent

22

decree was entered, Bell was decided.

Nobody did anything

23

about it.

25

after Bell was decided.

So that was completely understood at the time.

QUESTION:

Well, sue them for breach of

contract.

4

mean, if your grievance is that they have welshed on the

5

deal, then you must have some contractual remedy.

6

I mean, could you not get some monetary -- I

But it is a little different saying that the

7

power and force of the Government must be invoked because

8

there has been a breach of contract.

9

MR. STERN:

This is, if I might say so, this is

10

an even stronger case than Local 93 because at least here,

11

unlike Local 93, this was a very disputable issue.

12

Why can't parties settle disputable issues?

And

13

if the answer to it is that they can settle disputable

14

issues, then the answer to that is it must be possible to

15

enforce it at a later time.

16

QUESTION:

But I think one can say, if you are

17

talking about a judgment for damages in the settlement, no

18

difficulty arises.

19

It is over and done with.

But if you are talking about an injunctive

20

decree where the Federal court is involved year after

21

year, surely somewhat different considerations prevail, do

22

you not think?

23

MR. STERN:

That is exactly why rule 60(b)(5)

24

provides the leeway for defendants to get out of it in a

25

substantial change of circumstances.

That's the deal, though.

6

QUESTION:

That's the deal.

7

MR. STERN:

Well, the System Federation case

8

held that when the result that was part of the consent

decree, it turns out to be affirmatively contrary to

10

Federal law, when the result -- in System Federation the

11

consent decree said union shops are illegal.

12

Congress passes a statute.

13

QUESTION:

Well, part of Federal law is that you

don't bind -- you do not tell a State how to run its

7

Do you agree to that?

8

MR. STERN:

I think the question is whether the,

9

whether System Federation would apply, whether there is a

10

difference because this Court has now held that something

11

is illegal.

12

That has not happened in this case.

QUESTION:

No, but is not the difference that

13

they could waive the illegality?

14

from that that they can, by an agreement, enlarge the

15

constitutional jurisdiction of the court.

16

But it does not follow

I mean, the one does not follow from the other,

17

even if you assume that the particular inmates can waive

18

the consequently declared illegality.

19

from that that they can enlarge the constitutional

20

jurisdiction of the court by an agreement.

21

MR. STERN:

It doesn't follow

We certainly have not argued and

22

don't argue that anything could be done to enlarge the

23

jurisdiction of the court.

24

defendants have ever said that there is no jurisdiction in

So I come back to the question of whether, if

3

you have an issue -- and after all, even under Bell, the

4

issue was always whether it is to a certain degree the

5

question of the totality of the circumstances.

6

QUESTION:

You know what we mean by enlarging

7

the jurisdiction of the court, Mr. Stern.

We mean letting

8

the court do something it does not have power to do, to
issue a decree that it is not independently empowered to

10

issue apart from this contract that the parties have.

11

And your answer is?

12

MR. STERN:

13

I do think that a court does have

such power.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STERN:

It has not.
But at least it has such power when

16

it is a disputable issue at the time the court approaches

17

it, when it is something that is negotiable, something

18

that could go either way.

1

here, something that could go either way.

3

MR. STERN:

a means of providing a remedy for the original

And now when we have the new jail, the new jail opens
