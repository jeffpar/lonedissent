ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ENGLERT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

11
12

the sue and be sued clause in the Red Cross charter gives

13

jurisdiction to the Federal courts or, instead, merely

14

confers on the Red Cross the capacity to sue and be sued.

15

The clause gives the Red Cross, quote, the power

16

to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or

17

Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States, end

18

quote.

19

The phrase State or Federal, on which we rely,

20

was added to the charter in 1947.

From 1905 to 1947, the

21

Red Cross had the same power to sue and be sued in courts

22

of law and equity, but the Federal courts were neither

23

excluded from nor specified in that grant of capacity.

24

There is no possible basis to doubt that the Red

25

Cross had the capacity to sue and be sued in Federal court

between 1905 and 1947.

Nevertheless, the First Circuit

2

construed the 1947 amendment as merely conferring that

3

very same capacity.

4

first error.

That, we submit, was the court's

But the case for giving a jurisdictional reading

5
6

to the sue and be sued clause rests on much more than the

7

fact that the First Circuit construed the 1947 amendment

8

to be meaningless.

9

this Court:

10

It rests on two venerable decisions of

Osborn v. Bank of the United States, and

D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC.
The Osborn decision, written by Chief Justice

11
12

Marshall, has been regarded as a landmark decision of this

13

Court for 168 years.

14

old, is famous in its own right in the banking field.

15

it's especially important because it was decided just

16

before the amendments to the Red Cross charter were

17

drafted.

18

The D'Oench decision, now 50 years

The Court in Osborn construed the sue and be

19

sued clause in the charter of the Second Bank of the

20

United States as a grant of jurisdiction.

21

Court thought the point so clear that it said that the

22

words could not be made plainer by explanation.

23

And

In fact, the

The Court recognized that some sue and be sued

24

clauses will merely confer the capacity to sue and not

25

jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

1

And I suppose we could explain the

2

result in Osborn by saying that that was an

3

instrumentality of the United States.

4

question that the bank was an instrumentality.

5

you agree with that?
MR. ENGLERT:

6

I think there is no

I agree with that; and there is no

7

question that the Red Cross is an instrumentality of the

8

United States.

This Court has so held.

QUESTION:

9

Well, but was the Bank of the United

10

States not an instrumentality in another sense?

11

words, it was an arm, an instrument, an instrumentality in

12

the United States, an agency of the United States?
MR. ENGLERT:

13

In other

I believe not, Justice Kennedy.

14

The Bank of the United States was 80 -- the second Bank of

15

the United States was 80 percent privately owned.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

Well, then McCulloch v. Maryland was

wrong.
MR. ENGLERT:

No, Your Honor, McCulloch v.

19

Maryland was right, and McCulloch v. Maryland was applied

20

to the Red Cross in the Department of Employment v. United

21

States, and has been applied to Army post exchanges -- to

22

other similar entities, that while not agencies of the

23

United States are tax-immune instrumentalities of the

24

United States.

MR. ENGLERT:

2

It has been held by this Court to

3

have a special tax exemption, by virtue of its status as

4

an instrumentality of the United States.
QUESTION:

5

But as a matter of our jurisprudence

6

and not just some statutory -- expressed statutory

7

provision?

MR. ENGLERT:

That's correct.

It receives

special tax treatment under a variety of statutes.

But

10

its immunity from State taxation is -- was held by this

11

Court to exist in Department of Employment v. United

12

States, by a line of cases directly descending from

13

McCulloch v. Maryland.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the international

15

charter of the Red Cross made it rather clear that a

16

national organization should not be any part of

17

governmental entity.

18

inconsistent with what you're saying now.

19

MR. ENGLERT:

And it seems to me that that's quite

No, Your Honor, that argument,

20

too, was made to this Court in the Department of

21

Employment v. United States case, and rejected -- and has

22

been rejected by the Ninth Circuit in subsequent cases.

23

It is certainly true that the charter of

24

the international -- not the charter, the statutes of the

25

International Committee of the Red Cross do require that

Court's decisions, a tax-immune instrumentality.

Did you cite Department of Employment

MR. ENGLERT:

Mr. Englert, don't you think language

in Osborn is really quite different?

No, Your Honor.

that Congress has the power to do that.
QUESTION:

Of course not.

So it's possible to

think in this grant, that jurisdiction is not referred to.

10

It is impossible in Osborn to think that jurisdiction is

11

not referred to.

12

MR. ENGLERT:

13

disagrees with that proposition.

Well, Professor Wright certainly

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, maybe he is wrong.
-- question the Osborn ruling.

In any event, Your Honor, that is

19

the First Circuit's reasoning.

20

read the charter in Osborn as a grant of jurisdiction for

21

that reason.

22

And the court might have

But it didn't.

It read the charter in Osborn as a grant of

jurisdiction for a quite different reason.

It said the

1

First Bank did not mention the courts of the Union.

because this charter mentions the courts of the Union, it

And

It did not refer to jurisdiction

at all.
But again, whatever validity that argument might

14

have had as an initial matter, that that's the reason why

15

the charter in Osborn grants jurisdiction, is not the

16

reason that was advanced by counsel, or by Chief Justice

17

Marshall for the Court.

18

provision in Osborn was Justice Johnson in his dissent.

19

It played no role in this Court's reasoning in Osborn.

The only justice who cited that

refers to any court of competent --a court of law or

amending a charter so that it said that an entity may sue

jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

And the Congress was entitled to

Mr. Englert, do you plan to address

8

the constitutional concerns that were raised in the

9

respondents' brief, and tell us in what way cases arise

10

under Federal law within the meaning of article 3, simply

11

because the Red Cross is a litigant?
MR. ENGLERT:

12

Well, that question was addressed

13

and answered for the first time in Osborn.

14

holding of Osborn in that respect has been reiterated

15

through the years, up to as recently as the Verlinden case

16

in 1983.

17

QUESTION:

And the

Well, don't you think in Verlinden

18

and more recent cases this Court has been wary of that

19

kind of a - - an approach?

20

MR. ENGLERT:

This Court has been wary of

21

extending that kind of approach.

22

But we're not asking for an extension of that kind of

23

approach, by any means.

There's no question.

Rico v. Russell & Co., what it reiterated in Gully, was

2

that a lawsuit against a federally chartered entity,

necessarily has an ingredient of Federal law because that

entity has no powers, save those granted by its charter.
QUESTION:

Well, what law is going to apply in

the tort suit, do you suppose?
MR. ENGLERT:

That does no prevent

QUESTION:

Well, it does, as in the -- it

11

certainly does, as a matter of plausible, logical

12

argument, even if not precedent.

13

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Your Honor, as was pointed

14

out in Verlindeh, the Court has taken two divergent paths

15

in interpreting arising under, under the statute and under

16

the Constitution.

17

very narrowly, under section 1331.

18

arising under very broadly under the Constitution.

19

again, it has been established, since 1824, that if the

20

suit is against a federally chartered entity, that

21

entity's capacity to sue and be sued is an ingredient of

22

the action that gives it the necessary Federal element to

23

satisfy article 3.

The Court has construed arising under
It has construed

And again, I would say that has -- that aspect
of Osborn has, to my knowledge, never been questioned.

It

is not the aspect that Justice Frankfurter questioned in

his Lincoln Mills dissent.

the contrary, this Court has reaffirmed.

although to be treated as exceptional - - is not being

7

questioned within its own realm.

It is not the aspect that is

In Gully, the

We do not think, ultimately, the constitutional
question -- in light of this Court's decisions - - is a

10

serious one.

construing statutes, but --

13

I put it that way because obviously the

QUESTION:

Do you have any further justification

14

for the doctrine on its merits, rather than on the basis

15

of stare decisis?

16

MR. ENGLERT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Red Cross,

17

as I was saying in response to some of Justice Kennedy's

18

questions, is an important Federal instrumentality.

19

exists for the purpose of fulfilling treaty obligations of

20

the United States.

If I might return to this Court's precedent --

11

notwithstanding the Chief Justice's question -- in FSLIC

12

against Ticktin, decided 3 years ago, the Court explained

13

at some length that there was party -- party-based

14

jurisdiction -- that was the Court's phrase -- over

15

the -- over cases brought by or against the Federal

16

Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.

17

Again, the Court was not troubled by the idea

18

that jurisdiction could depend on who the party is and not

19

what the questions raised are -- which is, again, what we

20

submit is true in this case.

21

Now, FSLIC, like the --

22

QUESTION:

Well, maybe the Court wasn't, but the

23

Constitution was.

I mean, it really does -- it speaks

24

about certain categories of party-based jurisdiction --

5

MR. ENGLERT:

It lists a bunch of

No, and that's exactly why in Bank

6

of the United -- in Osborn v. Bank of the United States,

7

Chief Justice Marshall examined for the Court the meaning

8

of the grant of arising under jurisdiction in the

9

Constitution and not one of those other grants of

10

jurisdiction in article 3, section 2, and held that it was

11

within the jurisdiction, within the constitutionally

12

granted jurisdiction that Congress could confer, to have

13

that kind of party-based jurisdiction in suits by and

14

against an instrumentality of the United States.

15

If the Court thinks it necessary to look to the

16

legislative history of the Red Cross charter, it will find

17

further support for our position on the statutory

18

question.

19

The reports to the Foreign Relations and Foreign

20

Affairs Committees refer the reader to the Harriman

Committee Report.

explains the reference to State and Federal courts as one

of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

the jurisdiction of the Federal courts can have anything

the Harriman Committee Report makes sense only if one

construes the charter as a grant of jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

The language of

What -- may I -- excuse me.

What do

7

you say to the argument that it may have been intended to

8

answer a question about the possibility of diversity

jurisdiction?
MR. ENGLERT:

10

Your Honor, I don't think there

11

was any serious question about the possibility of

12

diversity jurisdiction at any time since 1905.

13

difficulty that federally chartered entities sometimes

14

encounter in invoking diversity jurisdiction is that,

15

because they are not citizens of any State, they lack a

16

basis for diversity jurisdiction.

17

Red Cross.

18

The

That's no true of the

In the 1905 charter, the section now codified at

19

36 U.S.C. section 1, and again in the 1947 charter, the

20

section codified at 36 U.S.C. section 1A, the Red Cross is

21

stated to be a citizen of the District of Columbia.

22

light of that, the cases that say Federal corporations

23

can't sue in diversity have no bearing on the Red Cross,

24

and never had any bearing on the Red Cross.

1

the charter had res diversity jurisdiction, it would

2

surely be sections 1 and 1A, no the sue and be sued clause

3

in section 2.

4

The First Circuit relied heavily on this Court's

5

1916 decision in the Bankers Trust case.

6

it simply got that decision wrong.

7

But in our view,

The sue and be sued clause at issue in that case

made no reference to the Federal courts.

If I may, I'd like to start by addressing the

1

2

constitutional question which seems to have troubled some

3

of the justices.

4

that article 3 of the Constitution permits Congress to

5

extend jurisdiction to cases of which the Red Cross is a

6

party.

We agree entirely with the Red Cross,

7

In article 3 section 2 there are two clauses of

8

the Constitution that are relevant to cases of this sort.

9

One clause that says that the judicial power shall extend

10

to all cases arising under this Constitution, the laws of

11

the United States, and treaties made under their

12

authority; the second clause says that the jurisdiction --

13

the judicial power shall extent to controversies to which

14

the United States shall be a party.

15

In our view, this case involves a sufficient

16

Federal issue that -- it arises under Federal law, not

17

just because this Court has said clearly in the past that

18

it does, but as a matter of logic and sound constitutional

19

interpretation.

20

First, as a matter of fact in this particular

21

case, the Red Cross is likely to raise issues of Federal

22

law in defense to the lawsuit.

23

Cross will contend that it is not subject to punitive

24

damages because of its relation to the Federal Government,

25

and also that it, in some cases, has resisted demands for

QUESTION:

No, it is not established Federal

QUESTION:

11

We express no

But I'm pointing out that --

Well, that sounds like bootstrapping,

12

though, to say we're going to raise an issue of Federal

13

law; we have no cases to support it.

14

because they're going to raise an issue of Federal law

15

that tends to support Federal jurisdiction?

16

MR. MANN:

And then you say

I must have misunderstood your

question.

And it seems to me you're now arguing

that, at least in some areas, Federal law is applicable.

3

MR. MANN:

No, Justice O'Connor.

I believe that

4

Mr. Englert's concession was that State law will apply to

5

the substantive determination of whether the Red Cross was

6

liable as a matter of negligence or under some other State

tort theory.

But that's not the real, main point.

8

9

They do plan to introduce Federal defenses.
The main

point is that this case would arise under Federal law for

10

purposes of article 3, without regard to any particular

11

issue raised in the case.

Court has repeatedly made, and that's what I would like to

13

address.

And that's the point that this

It's important to realize that the

MR. MANN:

In our view, it's also well

MR. MANN:

under this Court's precedent.

address is, to the extent that people are concerned that

15

those precedents may go too far, and it is suggested that

16

Congress could extent the judicial power to cases that

17

would be improper, this case does not present a serious

18

problem under that.

19

I think they're beside the point
But what I'm trying to

It does not raise that concern because the Red

Cross is so closely related to the United States

Government that it's clear that Congress could extend it

MR. MANN:

1

I believe that it would

if this

2

Court wished to cut back on the constitutional rule that

3

it has articulated in the Pacific Railroad Removal cases,

4

it would be unlikely that it would do so to an extent that

5

would deprive entities that are as closely related to the

6

Federal Government as the Red Cross, and perform statutory

7

and treaty-mandated function as important as those that

8

are performed by the Red Cross.
And I would suggest that that would be an

9
10

appropriate lending principle that would allow this Court

11

not to have to face a significant constitutional question

12

in this case.
I would also point out that this Court's

13
14

decision in Osborn v. Bank of the United States

15

specifically acknowledged that --a number of limits on

16

17

Congress could merely throw a cloak over a State

Congress didn't just make this entity a Federal

No, that's not entirely accurate,

17

Justice Stevens, because to get in under Federal question

19

title 28.

20

there's a variety of rules that this Court has articulated

21

to limit the statutory, arising-under jurisdiction to a

22

much narrower field of play than the constitutional

23

24

have the same meaning.

quite a different thing to say that Congres could not

whether we should adopt a construction of the statute that

makes it entirely unnecessary to even consider the

Congress cloaked with a Federal charter simply to get it

2

into Federal court, and it had no significant relation to

3

the Federal Government, and for which there was no reason

4

for its having a Federal charter except to get into

5

Federal court, I think this Court might step back and say

well, we've said that any Federal charter will satisfy but

that one does not.

8

suggests such a limitation.

9

And, in fact, the analysis in Osborn

The last thing I would like to point out on this

10

point is the criticisms to which Justice O'Connor refers

11

are, for the most part, directed at this Court's

12

interpretation of the statutory jurisdiction.

13

that this Court repeatedly has criticized the notion that

14

Congress would have wanted to extend with the general

15

Federal question statute all of the permissible

16

jurisdiction permitted by article 3 to the courts.

17

It is true

And Justice Frankfurter, in the Lincoln Mills

18

case, and the Court in the Romero case, rightly, suggested

19

that it would be unwise to believe that Congress, in a

20

general statute, intended to commit every single piece of

21

jurisdiction that the arising-under clause permits.

22

But that criticism is not directed at the notion

23

that Congress constitutionally could take an entity that

24

is an arm of the United States -- to use this Court's

phrase -- and create Federal jurisdiction over cases to

If I could just, in brief, in closing -- the

Now, Red Cross claims that the sue and be sued

as simply a grant of capacity to litigate.

They

12

usually it's only when there's very specific and clear

language, and usually there's a reference to particular

courts.

15

There's got to be some way that you distinguish

the language which relates to capacity to litigate to the

language which is a conferral of jurisdiction, especially

if it's all mingled into one sentence, as this is.

Going on, I would say that in the Red Cross

charter, there's no concern there as to which States

have -- State courts have jurisdiction over the Red Cross.

18

opens up the entire Federal system to the Red Cross, at

19

any level.

Because in D'Oench, there is language very-

similar to the Red Cross charter, but further on in the

As I understand

17

what you're saying is that although the statute had

the State, there was some doubt about the

20

constitutionality of that statute.

21

MR. UPTON:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Well, why wouldn't the same

constitutional doubt apply to the amendment to the Red

to confer Federal question jurisdiction?

to me if the constitutional doubt applied to the existing

Federal statute, it would equally apply to the amendment

to the Red Cross charter.
MR. UPTON:

7

Because it seems

Well, let me say this.

I find the

8

discussion in the legislative history concerning this

9

matter extremely ambiguous and confusing.

I'm not sure

what Congress was talking about.

Of course a simpler way, if they

was to give diversity jurisdiction.

12

MR. UPTON:

That could well have been done.

13

My feeling is that the -- and the First Circuit,

14

too -- is that this amendment was very poorly drafted.

15

should have been more specific as to exactly what they

16

were driving at.

MR. UPTON:

3

Well, there could be some alarm with

4

whether or not other Federal corporations with similar

5

charters may attempt to invoke Federal jurisdiction, if

6

this case is -- if we construe this charter as a grant of

7

Federal jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

8

9

So you think there are cases that

hang on this one then?
MR. UPTON:

10

I think there are other Federal

11

corporations - - I can cite three - - which have very

12

similar charters.

13

Neighborhood - - excuse me - - Neighborhood

14

Reinvestment Corporation has a very similar charter;

15

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a very similar

16

charter; and Securities Investor Protection Corporation

17

has almost an identical charter - - and all three of these

18

corporations, sooner or later, will be seeking Federal

19

jurisdiction if this case is decided in the favor of Red

20

Cross.

21

As I stated, the way this is drafted, there's no

22

concern for the peculiarities of each -- court system, the

23

State and the Federal, one being -- one having courts of

24

general jurisdiction, the others having -- the other

25

having courts of limited jurisdiction.

And therefore, I think it's sound to construe

1

this statute not as a grant of jurisdiction, but as a

3

4

specificity in it.

5

in the Bankers Trust case, which this Court ruled was

a -- simply a grant of capacity to litigate.

7

There's not enough

And it resembles strongly the charter

Now in 1925, Congress, at the urging of three

8

justices of this Court, legislatively overruled the Osborn

9

case, insofar as it pertained to Federal corporations.

At

10

that time, it precluded Federal corporations from access

11

to Federal courts unless they were owned or controlled by

12

the United States.

13

Now, that was a very strong, and definite

14

policy, which has been followed by this Court over the

15

last 50 years.

16

to make an exception, as it has with certain Federal

17

corporations, it would have done so by very clear and

18

specific language -- such as the FDIC charter, and the

19

Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.

20

charters are very specific, and I suggest if they were

policy.

1

I think that that statute requires

clear and specific language, in the same way that if

the consequence that ensued in D'Oench, Duhme, which

would - - there would have been a Federal common law

governing the Red Cross, which perhaps they did not want.

15

MR. UPTON:

Well, that's true, Your Honor.

16

I -- however, I -- I'm getting to the D'Oench case, and I

17

would like to discuss that for a moment.
And I think the D'Oench case is quite

distinguishable from the Red Cross case, and, in fact,

supports our position more than it does the Red Cross

position.

22

which is very similar -- to sue and be sued in courts of

law and equity, State or Federal -- very similar.

deemed to arise language, that the purpose was to grant

Federal jurisdiction.

required, if the earlier sue and be sued clause was a

grant of Federal jurisdiction?

Now, why was that later amendment

Finally, I would suggest that the legislative

9
10

history of the 1947 amendment, the addition of the

11

language State or Federal, is both ambiguous and confused.

12

Courts have read that recommendation 22 -- number 22.

13

Some have said oh, all they're trying to do is clarify

14

capacity to litigate in Federal court where it otherwise

15

exist.

16

Other courts -- half of the courts below -- have

17

said no, that's a grant of Federal jurisdiction.

18

think that's an indication right there that this is a very

19

ambiguous piece of work.

20

Now, I

I would also point out for the Court there is

21

language in recommendation number 22 which seems more

22

consistent with a grant of capacity to sue.

23

should clarify the capacity to litigate in Federal court.

24

They use the word clarify, and then they go on to say make

25

it clear that the Red Cross can sue in Federal court.
