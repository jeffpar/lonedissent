ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK I. SAMET

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SAMET:

Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

11

The question this case presents is whether a

12

party, which was neither a purchaser nor seller of

13

securities, and for that reason lacks standing to sue for

14

securities fraud under the Exchange Act, section 10(b) and

15

rule 10b-5, may nevertheless sue for the same conduct —

16

security-based fraud in the sale of securities — as a

17

predicate act of racketeering activity under RICO.

18
19

In order to answer this question, the Court will
be called upon to construe section 1964 —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SAMET:

22

Did you say predicate act?
Yes, a predicate act of racketeering

activity.

Not a predicate crime, is that it?

QUESTION:

Or a predicate violation of law?

2

MR. SAMET:

Well, I would prefer the term

3

"predicate act" because it's neutral.

As you'll see in my

4

argument, I don't think necessarily all of these things

5

are crimes, although I believe the overwhelming import in

6

the criminal portion of RICO is to delineate crimes.

7

I think when we're talking about --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SAMET:

This is civil?
-- civil RICO, we're not speaking

10

about crimes.

11

in so far as it a -- as it is a component of an element of

12

a civil cause of action.

13

and I'll try to get to that.

14

I think we're speaking about a crime only

I think it makes a difference,

But I do agree that RICO is a criminal act, and

15

that it purports to delineate crimes, but it also purports

16

to delineate acts more generally.

17

QUESTION:

Yeah, but you're going to be -- I

18

suppose you're going to be arguing that if this conduct

19

wasn't a violation of the securities law, it can't be a
predicate act.

MR. SAMET:

You're absolutely correct.

That is

exactly —
QUESTION:

But aren't you arguing then that the

act has to be a violation of the securities law?
MR. SAMET:

The act — well, there are different

interrupted.
MR. SAMET:

4

No, there are different schools of

5

thought as to exactly what the nature of the conduct is

6

that defines the RICO predicate acts.

7

Court will be called upon to construe the following three

8

key phrases.

10

in his business or property — and the Court will be

called upon to construe the meaning of "injured in his

11

business or property" -- by reason of -- and the Court

12

will be called upon to construe the meaning of the phrase

13

"by reason of" -- a violation of section 1962.

14

Justice White, gets into your question about what is a

15

violation of 1962.

In any event, this

Section 1964(c) states, any person injured

And that,

I think the RICO Act means 1962 defines certain

16
17

wrongful acts or crimes, whatever you like, and it then

18

incorporates -- it says you cannot commit a pattern of

19

racketeering activity with respect to these crimes or

20

acts.

21

section 1961 lists about 36 crimes or acts, and one of

22

them is fraud in the sale of securities.

23

we'll be talking about today.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SAMET:

And then the definition of racketeering activity in

Sure.

Do you not assume for purpose of your

2

argument that such a fraud actually occurred, that there

3

was a predicate act.

connection between it and your client.

5

You just challenge the causal

MR. SAMET:

I must assume it in this posture of

6

the case because we're here on a motion for summary

7

judgment.

8

for purpose of this argument we assume there was a fraud

because it --

At trial we'll contest it, but I do agree that

there was no standing.

I think, absent standing,

Well, but standing doesn't affect

Well, I think it does the way -- I'm

Go ahead.
QUESTION:

Well, I can understand your argument

21

that there's no standing here, no causal connection and

22

all, but if the violation of 10b occurred, and that's a

23

predicate act within the statute, I don't understand why

24

you don't concede there was a predicate act, but merely

25

argue that it didn't have the necessary causal connection.

1

Because I think -- well, I do make

2

those additional arguments, but I think standing is an

3

element of the cause of the civil cause of action, which

4

is what I think RICO intends to incorporate when it talks

5

about fraud in the sale of securities.

MR. SAMET:

QUESTION:

Do you think Blue Chip holds that in

10b-5, that there's no 10b-5 violation at all?
MR. SAMET:

No, but I think that the Blue Chip

means that there's no 10b violation for which anyone can

10

sue if there's no standing.

And RICO is intended, I

11

believe, to incorporate the wisdom of Blue Chip.

12

think they are. related to each other.

So I

13

I think -- I think that the restatement of the

14

question here essentially is, is the Securities Investor

15

Protection Corporation, SIPC, a person or a party that was

16

injured by reason of this alleged fraud in the sale of

17

securities .•

18

QUESTION:

Isn't it agreed that SIPC is simply

19

here standing in the shoes of investors who themselves

20

could not have met the Birnbaum test?

21

MR. SAMET:

Not at all, Your Honor.

Not at all,

22

Chief Justice.

23

record shows and the law is that SIPC is not subrogated to

24

any of those claims.

were customers of the failed brokerage firm.

They paid

2

out money to investors who bought and sold the allegedly

3

manipulated securities, and they paid out money to people

4

who didn't.

5

Now, as to the people who did buy and sell the

6

allegedly manipulated securities, they commenced a class

7

action.

8

SIPC can't be subrogated to their claim, because it's

9

already been exercised.

It was settled.

They got their recovery.

So

As to the people who didn't buy

10

or sell the allegedly manipulated securities, SIPC can't

11

be subrogated to their claim because they, like SIPC, are

12

too remote from the event to have a claim in the first

13

place.

14

Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit held that the

15

only way SIPC can acquire a subrogation right -- and this

16

is in an earlier case.

17

has reached the Ninth Circuit.

18

is in the record, the Ninth Circuit held that SIPC is

19

subrogated to any fraud claims if and only if the brokers

20

who SIPC came in to pay out exercised unauthorized use of

21

customer funds to buy the manipulated securities.

22

didn't happen.

This is the third time this case
In an earlier case, which

Discovery has established that didn't

happen, so there's no fraud claim for SIPC to be

subrogated to.

We must look at SIPC only as SIPC and ensure,

2

if you will, that paid out monies, and not as a subrogee,

because there is no subrogation.

Justice --

QUESTION:

MR. SAMET:

8

QUESTION:

9

Can I interrupt for -- right there?
Sure.
As to the category of customers who

purchased or sold the manipulated securities, and who had
%

10

their own class action and recovered some of their own

11

money, did that recovery not reduce the obligation of SIPC

12

to pay to them their losses?

13
14

MR. SAMET:

It probably should have --

15
16

I don't think it worked that way.

QUESTION:

So they got a double recovery, in

effect?

17

MR. SAMET:

That's the problem.

That's -- you

18

have hit, Justice Stevens, on exactly the problem of

19

allowing SIPC a recovery here.

20

recovery, and since it's RICO, it would be a sextuple

21

recovery.

22

QUESTION:

There would be a double

Well, we didn't grant certiorari to

review SIPC's separate standing.

whether a person has standing under RICO when they

wouldn't have if they were just going under a straight

Securities Act claim.

4

these ramifications of what SIPC did or didn't do?
MR. SAMET:

5

Why do we need to get into all of

I don't think you do.

SIPC's brief

6

raises them, and therefore, I'm responding to the

7

questions from the Court and anticipating them in SIPC's

8

position.

9

uniqueness of SIPC -- and I agree, that's not the larger,

But I will tell you, totally apart from the

10

more interesting question.

11

question is do we have -- you're looking at SIPC as SIPC,

12

not as a subrogee -- do we have a situation in which SIPC

13

was injured by reason of the alleged violation.

I think it's related to what we've granted

Supposing there had been no lawsuit by the

20

customers of these firms that had purchased and sold

21

securities, that they lost their money when the brokerage

22

firm went bankrupt.

23

was precisely the amount that they lost in making

24

purchases and sales of the manipulated securities.

25

you say, then, that there was no standing on the part of

Would

SIPC to reimburse?
MR. SAMET:

2

No.

If in fact it was a valid

3

subrogation to people who had a claim, who were themselves

purchasers and sellers of securities, there would be a --

5

there would be standing, and I wouldn't be able to make

6

the argument I'm making.

7

I'm making the argument --

8

QUESTION:

9

So doesn't our answer in this case

depend on the extent to which there is subrogation of

10

claims of purchasers or -- the extent to which SIPC

11

reimbursed persons who had valid claims?
MR. SAMET:

12

Unfortunately, in part, it.does.

13

This is not a case that purely raises the purchaser-seller

14

issue.

15

is and what it did.

16

think the Court is most interested in, the pure question.

17

Unfortunately, the question of less general interest comes

18

from this record and cannot be avoided.

19

It does raise these related questions of who SIPC
But I'm trying to address, and I

But discussing the pure general question of do

20

we have here — is SIPC, in its own capacity, a purchaser

Court to look at the key phrases in RICO.

First,

"the

What that

1

courts is essentially that a person must be directly

2

injured in their business or property.
If, for example, a corporation is the target of

3
4

a racketeering act, a shareholder cannot sue for injury to

5

the corporation because the shareholder was not the direct

6

victim; the corporation was.

7

union is the target of racketeering activity, the union

8

member may not sue for RICO because it was not the

directly injured victim; the union was.

10

Well, here --

11

QUESTION:

Cases have held that if a

So that argument is the same whether

12

or not it's a securities violation, which is the alleged

13

predicate act, or any other violation?

14

MR. SAMET:

Absolutely.

That's absolutely

15

correct.

And here — indeed, I think the purchase or

16

seller implication in the doctrine of standing comes

17

directly from the general principals of RICO.

18

have to focus on securities law to reach the same

19

conclusion.

20

that looking at the general concept of RICO, SIPC here is

21

not a person who was directly injured.

You don't

I completely agree with you, Justice Kennedy,

QUESTION:

But your argument depends on our

looking first to find out in what capacity SIPC brought

the suit, whether it was subrogee for purchasers of

1

manipulated securities or something else.
MR. SAMET:

2

It doesn't matter, Justice O'Connor.

3

You reach the same result either way because, on this

4

record, there is nothing for SIPC to be subrogated to, and

5

therefore, this Court is faced with a pure question.

6

If there were a viable argument that SIPC Is

7

subrogated to a claim, then you could go off on a

8

subrogation issue.

9

subrogated to anything.

But there isn't.

SIPC isn't

I'm addressing that because SIPC

10

talks about it.

11

isn't subrogated to anything, then one reaches the general

12

question.

13

But if one accepts the notion that SIPC

And I think that's this case.
I think SIPC is subrogated to nothing, and we

14

reach the general question.

15

question -- the first proposition on the general question

16

is that we do not have a party that was directly injured.

17

SIPC was not directly injured.

18

victims, it were the purchasers and sellers of these

19

allegedly manipulated securities, not SIPC.

20

And the general

If there were direct

The second important point, I believe, is that

21

any injury to SIPC was not by reason of the alleged fraud

in — of the sale of securities.

23

is that this Court has said in Sedima,

24

requires the showing of a proximate causal connection

Here there were many, many intervening events.

The harm complained of operated on the purchasers and

sellers of securities.

firms took a large position in the allegedly manipulated

securities.

9

firms were otherwise in precarious financial condition,

Now, in addition, for that to

And it had to be the case that the brokerage

10

and therefore, taking this position and these securities

11

caused their financial demise.
It had to be the case that SIPC comes in and

12

13

says, well, let's make the failure of these brokerage

14

firms subject to SIPA.

15

composition of the assets of the defunct brokerage firms

16

was such that they could not pay out or simply give to the

17

customers of the brokerage firms their securities.

18

those events, none of which were intended or foreseen by

19

the persons that allegedly committed the securities fraud,

had to occur before SIPC would sustain the loss that it

sustained.

QUESTION:

Mr. Samet —

2

QUESTION:

May I interrupt there?

You've put in

3

an awful lot of events.

4

involved is that the brokerage firm itself had taken a

5

large position in manipulated securities and there -- and

6

that was the only thing that caused it to fail.

7

result of the failure, SIPC had to pay a lot of money to

8

its customers.
MR. SAMET:

9

Supposing that all that was

And as a

Well, we have an even clearer case

10

here because the brokerage firm -- the trustees of the

11

brokerage firm are themselves parties to the action, the

12

brokerage firm did take a position in the securities, and

13

we're not challenging the trustees' standing.

14

challenging SIPC's standing.

15

implication of your question that if the brokerage firm

16

was itself a purchaser or seller, we wouldn't have the

17

argument we have.

18

We're

So I agree with the

But it's SIPC that's coming in, and they're not

19

a purchaser or seller, and therefore, we have the argument

20

on standing that we wouldn't if the brokerage firm were

21

the only plaintiff, or the trustees were the only

22

plaintiffs.

QUESTION:

I'm still not sure what your answer

24

is.

25

failed was because it made purchases of the manipulated

question.

10

That would be a closer, harder

It's not the question we now have -QUESTION:

Well, what's the answer to that

question?
MR. SAMET:

Well, that's the one you don't have

to write an opinion on.
QUESTION:

I would —

Well, but I think you're general

approach to it might decide that case.

11

MR. SAMET:

12

QUESTION:

I don't think so.
Because you said, as I understand

13

you, that unless SIPC itself were a purchaser or seller of

14

securities, it has no RICO claim.

15

MR. SAMET:

Well, I think the logic of the

16

general approach, and I agree you presented a tougher case

17

than the one we have here today, but the logic of the

18

general approach is that if you ain't a purchaser or

19

seller, you ain't got standing.

20

QUESTION:

I'm surprised you found that a hard

21

question, Mr. Samet.

22

think that's an easy question.

The answer is, in my view, if you

are not a purchaser or seller you are not causally

But the analysis is exactly the same.

4

QUESTION:

Well, of course, for wire fraud or

5

for mail fraud, do you still have to -- you say there

still has to be a purchaser or seller?

7

MR. SAMET:

Yes, for the reason that the

8

provisions of 1964(c), the requirement that injury be to a

9

person's business or property, meaning direct injury, and

10

that the injury be by reason of, meaning proximate causal

has to do with in effect, Blue Chip, and that is this:

10

that the RICO predicate act is defined as fraud in the

definition of a predicate act, it contrasts with the other

13

predicate acts in the statute.

That makes the

And that brings us, in my view,

to the Chief Justice's excellent opinion when he was an
associate justice in Blue Chip Stamp, which spoke about
what the requirements were for standing with respect to
fraud in the sale of securities.

And those

principles -- that decision in 1975, was based upon, and
involved from a principal of law back in the Birnbaum
case, dating back to 1952, a Second Circuit case.

And

those principles were accepted ever since 1952, even
earlier, really.

They've existed in securities law for 40

years, and when RICO was passed in 1970, Congress
reflected no intention to overrule, subvert, circumvent,
do away with, existing securities laws, principles, and
decisions.
And so that standing limitation that comes from
Blue Chip should be carried forward when looking at RICO.
And RICO talks about fraud in the sale of securities
because that's a piece of learning, basic learning, about
what fraud in the sale of securities is and involved, and
it's a settled, litigated matter at the Supreme Court
level, that is a decision that there was no objection to
at all anywhere in the congressional history of RICO.

13

15

the requirement of civil law with regard to standing in

But broad construction does not mean

And what we are arguing here --

Well, why is RICO to be construed

Is that something this Court has said?

MR. SAMET:

QUESTION:

MR. SAMET:

This statute says it.

And also, I

I think that's a

I don't think —

QUESTION:

15

MR. SAMET:

What does the statute say?
The statute at some point says -- I

16

don't have the section offhand -- says that RICO is to be

17

construed liberally to effectuate its remedial purposes.

18

That's in the RICO statute.

19

That's a statutory mandate.

I don't think that statutory mandate need or

that you should look at the plain meaning of the words,

So I don't think the requirement that RICO be construed

2

broadly, if it is a requirement, need dictate your

decision.

4

The second argument that SIPC has raised, which

5

I think should not persuade this Court -- and I'd like to

6

deal with it just to be sure, if there are any questions

7

on it — has to do with the express and implied limitation

or differentiation.

12

precludes SIPC from recovering.

unfortunate, it's correct law.

In one of it's

But in any event, Blue Chip evolved from section

15

10(b) and rule 10b-5, and judicially implied causes of

16

action.

17

and SIPC have tended to put significance of that and have

18

said that because RICO is express and Blue Chip is dealing

19

with implied remedy, somehow the construction of them

20

should be different, or the construction of RICO should be

21

more broad because one is dealing with an express statute.

22

But if one looks at what it is that's expressed in

23

1964(c), what the express -- statute expresses, it has the

24

very limitations on it that we are arguing for — namely,

25

that the injury must be by reason of, and it must be

Now there is another aspect of the case, which

again is unique to SIPC, does not involve the general

principal, but I think it needs to be address only because

5

I think this Court should deal with the general principal,

7

the case law in general — if the Court focuses only on

8

the nature of SIPC, so I would like to briefly address

that for a second.

10

Because SIPC argues that they have a special

status, and somehow, whatever the general rule is should

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SAMET:

SIPC

isn't seeking reimbursement for what they paid.

2

seeking treble damages under RICO.

3

subrogation and RICO are inconsistent because RICO,

I didn't say it did.
Okay.
I didn't say it did, but it was a

liquidation.
MR. SAMET:

But this is the claim that we're

discussing:

SIPC's power to assert.

It's as though SIPC

7

came into that terrorist airplane crash, having nothing to

do with it, and say, well, we're a party to all

proceedings.

We have the power to get in here.

10

SIPC must show it has the standing on a specific

11

case basis and its authorization to appear as a real party

12

in liquidation proceedings doesn't give it standing here.

MR. SAMET:

Yes, that is exactly correct, Mr.

Justice White.
But third of all, we think that the Blue Chip

case was right as it applied to securities law, and is

18

even more right, even though it didn't address RICO,

19

because didn't -- it wasn't before the Court at that time.

20

QUESTION:

Of course, the Blue Chip case, you

21

know, cuts against you in a way because that opinion

22

assumed there were classes of investors other than

23

purchasers or sellers who could be directly injured.

24

they nevertheless followed the old Birnbaum rule and

25

limited standing to purchasers and sellers.

So the

premise of that decision was that there are a category of

people directly harmed by the wrongdoing.

3

Well, of course we all know the

author of that decision sits on this Court and is best --

5

in the best position to describe what the decision meant.

But I don't read it that way.

That's what he said in the opinion.

He discusses the three classes of harmed persons and said

they don't have standing

MR. SAMET:

MR. SAMET:

I'm sure he would make very clear

11

what he means, but let me tell you what I think he meant,

12

to be corrected, I'm sure, by him.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. SAMET:

I think that the policy

15

considerations in Blue Chip, the concept of vexatious

16

litigation, the concept of strikes, the concept of

17

bludgeoning settlements are all the more egregious in RICO

18

than they were in the securities law because the stakes

19

are three times as high.

20

And it's interesting, in the amicus here, it's

21

interesting to see who the amici are.

23

there has been massive abuse of civil RICO.

In today's Wail Street Journal,

the excesses of RICO civil abuse.

in Blue Chip are even more egregious in the RICO area.
