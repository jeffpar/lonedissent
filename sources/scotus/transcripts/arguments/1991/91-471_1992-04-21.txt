ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether Alabama's

12

waste disposal tax, which is levied only on waste

13

generated outside that state, discriminates against

14

interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.

15

Petitioner Chemical Waste Management operates,

16

owns and operates a hazardous waste disposal facility near

17

Emelle, Alabama.

18

under both Federal and state law, and virtually every

19

aspect of its operations are closely regulated by both the

20

Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Alabama

21

Department of Environmental Management.

22

is designed to minimize to the greatest degree possible

23

any threat to public health and the environment.

24
25

This facility is authorized to operate

That regulation

The statute challenged in this case levies a $72
per ton tax on waste disposed of at the Emelle facility

that is generated outside Alabama.

Waste generated within

2

Alabama is not subject to the tax.

The trial court

3

declared this statute invalid under the Commerce Clause on

4

the ground that it impermissibly discriminates against

5

interstate commerce.

6

holding that because the overall purpose of the tax was to

7

protect public health and the environment, the Commerce

8

Clause's antidiscrimination principle did not apply.

9

The Alabama Supreme Court disagreed,

We submit that the unconstitutionality of this

10

provision is clear under long-settled Commerce Clause

11

principles.

12

interstate commerce violates the Commerce Clause unless it

13

advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be

14

adequately served by reasonable non-discriminatory

15

alternatives.

16

satisfied by a discrimination tax, save in one

17

circumstance where the tax in fact is not economically

18

discriminatory because it precisely compensates for an

19

identical levy that is limited to in-state commerce.

A law that discriminates on its face against

The Court has never found this test

QUESTION:

Mr. Pincus, if there were no Federal

21

legislation governing this area do you suppose the State

22

of Alabama could just ban any importation of hazardous

23

waste into the state?

legislation -4

QUESTION:

2

MR. PINCUS:

Right.
--at all, then that would come

3

very close to resembling the kinds of statutes that this

4

Court upheld in the quarantine cases.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly.
Of course, as your question points

7

out, there are two distinctions here.

8

quarantine.

It's a tax.

One, this is not a

And two, there is the Federal

legislation.
QUESTION:

10

Well, do you suppose instead of a ban

11

they could just knowingly impose a tax at such a level

12

that it would discourage the importation?

13

MR. PINCUS:

We think not, Justice O'Connor,

14

because we think the local purposes underlying those two

15

types of statutes are very different.

16

cases' the local interest that the Court identified was an

17

interest in preventing any additional items of the

18

particular good into the state at all.

1

interest was in reducing it to the minimum degree

20

possible.

21

In the quarantine

The state's

Here that is not Alabama's interest.

That's not

22

what the statute does, and in fact that's not the interest

23

that respondents assert in their brief.

24

that Alabama's health and safety interest is in reducing

25

volumes, keeping volume to some, what they regard as an

Here they assert

acceptable level.

2

there is no, the out-of, the state of origin makes no

3

difference.

4

whatever the volume is, then that volume, wherever it

5

comes from, the risk will be the same and they have no

6

interest in discriminating.

If they're willing to have 600,000 tons, or

QUESTION:

7
8

And if volume is the question, then

Well, I don't know that that follows.

It seems to me rather cruel to say that the less
solicitous of her sister states Alabama is, the more we're

10

going to punish her.

11

going to allow any states to dump anything here, they're

12

saying well, you know, there may be some of our sister

13

states that have real problems, and if they're really, you

14

know, if it's that serious that they're willing to pay

15

this amount per ton we'll let them do it.

a reasonable solution?

Alabama.

MR. PINCUS:

I mean, instead of saying we're not

Why isn't that

And it could be based on the same

But again, Justice Scalia, that's

20

not the interest that's underlying their statute.

I mean,

21

that's really two interests.

22

reducing volumes, and the other is an interest in insuring

23

that Alabama generators are completely taken care of and

24

then leaving something over for the rest of the generators

25

in the country.

One is an interest in

That's the kind of state we are.

Why isn't that thoroughly admirable?

QUESTION:

3

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you.
We think that the question whether

4

this, the interest that Alabama asserts here are

5

sufficient to justify upholding the first discriminatory

6

tax outside of the compensating tax area is answered by

7

this Court's decision in City of Philadelphia, and the

8

answer is no.

The Court held in City of Philadelphia that

New Jersey could not ban the disposal of out-of-state
10

waste because there was no - -

11

QUESTION:

12

13

But there you didn't have the

hazardous waste problem, Mr. Pincus.
MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, New Jersey's, the

14

rationale that New Jersey relied upon was precisely the

15

same protection of the public health and the environment

16

that Alabama is relying on here, and the Court expressly

17

said we're not saying that New Jersey is wrong about the

18

fact that the statute will protect that interest.

1

just saying that there's no reason, that interest doesn't

20

justify the discrimination.

21

excuse me, did cover all kinds of solid waste.

QUESTION:

transported was simply garbage, which I suppose has some

dangers inherent, but I don't believe it's the same as the

hazardous waste.
MR. PINCUS:

2

Well, as I say, Your Honor, the

3

Court did not, did not go off on some kind of level of

4

hazard.

5

New Jersey had a legitimate public health interest and

6

just said it could not promote that interest in this

7

discriminatory way because there were less discriminatory

8

means available to it.

And we think that's precisely true

of the situation here.

Alabama has less discriminatory

It assumed for the purpose of its decision that

means.
It can impose a reasonable even-handed cap.

It

12

can say you can only dispose of X hundred thousand tons,

whatever level they are comfortable with, providing it

14

means other, whatever other applicable constitutional and

15

statutory requirements there are, or they can impose an

even-handed tax.

QUESTION:

Could Alabama impose a requirement

18

that provided for the least possible transportation of

1

that stuff within Alabama?

20

MR. PINCUS:

Alabama could try and enact an

21

entirely different statute that did regulate

22

transportation, and then we'd have to see precisely what

it did, whether --

MR. PINCUS:

QUESTION:

urging here.

9

that would be a disposal regulation.

That statute doesn't regulate
Waste could be transported anywhere,

QUESTION:

still win this one.
MR. PINCUS:

12

That would just regulate,

Yes, but you could lose that case and

We could certainly lose that case,

13

Justice White, and still win this one because Alabama has

14

not done that, and it hasn't purported to do anything

15

about transportation.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

17

QUESTION:

You -- I'm sorry.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Pincus, do you suppose Congress

19

has indicated its affirmative consent to this kind of a

20

scheme in Alabama?
MR. PINCUS:

21

We don't think so, Justice

22

O'Connor.

First of all I should say preliminarily that

23

Alabama does not rely on any congressional authorization

here.

It didn't preserve those arguments below.

QUESTION:

1

The EPA has approved a similar st.ate

2

tax scheme for South Carolina.

3

MR. PINCUS:

Is that right?

Well, we -- let me just, I'm'sorry

4

-- in addition to the procedural problem, we don't think

5

Congress has authorized discrimination here.

6

precedents make clear that congressional authorization

7

must be unambiguous, and there's just nothing in these

8

statutes that are pointed to by the amici that constitutes

9

unambiguous authorization.

This Court's

One provision is a savings clause similar to the

10
11

one that the Court found insufficient in Wyoming against

12

Oklahoma and a number of other cases.

13

statute that authorizes EPA to review state programs, and

14

if it finds them consistent with the Federal program,

15

authorize the states to, EPA will withdraw and essentially

16

the states will be the hazardous waste regulator in the

17

state.

The other is a

18

Now, that says, that's a limitation on state

19

authority because what that statute says is that state

20

regulation must be consistent with the Federal scheme.

21

And it's in implementing that statutory mandate that EPA

22

reviewed the South Carolina discriminatory tax and found

23

that it did not violate the consistency requirement.

24

EPA, as I say the statutory scheme and the regulation

25

don't give South Carolina the authority to discriminate.

Now,

Second of all, EPA did not purport to be applying the

2

Commerce Clause.

3

different requirement that may or may not be overlapping.

It purported to be applying a completely

We think that the way the schemes fit together

4
5

is clear.

The Commerce Clause exists as a free-standing

6

limit on state authority, and EPA has apparently

7

determined, or at least in that case determined that

8

something that might, that whether or not something
violated the Commerce Clause was irrelevant for its

10

decision whether the state program was consistent.

11

don't think that has anything to do with the Commerce

12

Clause challenge we have brought in this case.

13

QUESTION:

But we

Mr. Pincus, suppose it could be shown

14

that what Alabama had in mind was it wanted to be sure

15

that there were private facilities available within

Alabama to dispose of dangerous materials in Alabama,

which is certainly a substantial state interest.

4

MR.- PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

5

problem with the hypothetical is that it's focusing on the

6

state as the market.

7

the framers decided is that the Nation is the economic

8

market, and Alabama can't set up - QUESTION:

And what the Commerce Clause, what

Not for dangerous goods.

The states

10

can be the markets for dangerous goods.

11

Haven't, don't our cases say that, that they can keep out

12

dangerous materials from other stated?

13

MR. PINCUS:

Can't they?

In think your cases say that if

14

there was a quarantine statute, a flat ban on any

15

importation, and if the state proves the kind of danger

16

that was established in those cases, that those kinds of

statutes will be upheld.

MR. PINCUS:

1

If Alabama had enacted a quarantine

2

statute which indicated that that was its interest, and if

3

it showed that in fact allowing additional items such as

4

this into the state, yes, then I think we'd lose.

5

I said earlier, we think that they haven't done either.

6

They haven't enacted a quarantine statute.

7

said that that's their interest.

They have said their

8

interest is in limiting volumes.

They said that would

9

take care of the public health risks that they see.

But as

They haven't

And

10

we think that if that's their interest there is a non-

11

discriminatory way to do it.
QUESTION:

12

So in effect you're saying, as I

13

guess you did to Justice Scalia, that it's got to be an

14

all or nothing rule?

15

MR. PINCUS:

I think that's right.

And I should

16

say in this context I'm not sure that even if they adopted

17

the all, the quarantine, that they could meet the standard

18

for establishing that there is the threat of imminent

19

massive danger that was present in the quarantine cases

saying is there was no intermediate, regulatory scheme that

2

limited the hazards that were posed by the weevils or the

3

infected cows.

4

Here we have a regulatory scheme - -

5

The question was can we keep them out.

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that you're

6

conceding that noxious wastes of this kind cannot be

7

distinguished from quarantine if a quarantine law is

8

passed.

9

I thought -MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor, that*'s what I was

10

just saying is I think this case is different because

11

these regulatory schemes are in place, and I think Alabama

12

would have difficulty making a showing of uncontrollable

13

danger that was, that the states had to make in those

14

cases to justify their quarantines precisely because there

15

is here a regulatory scheme that covers transportation,

16

every facet of these wastes' handling and disposal is

17

covered in a way that very, very significantly lessens the

18

danger.

19

QUESTION:

Is one way to characterize that

20

circumstance of the law to say that there is a commerce in

21

waste, but that there was not a commerce in the noxious

22

products that were the subject of the quarantine cases?

23

That's something of a legal conclusion, but --

24
25

MR. PINCUS:

I think many of the quarantine

cases do state that those items are not items of commerce

because they are so objectionable, because they threaten

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

It does discriminate in favor of

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

It does, but there are several

21

ways to look at the quarantine cases.

One of them is

22

that, as the response to the Chief Justice illustrated a

23

short time ago, in fact the quarantine cases are a subset

24

of the category in which the state interest could not be

But there's

*

1

another element of the quarantine cases which simply is

2

not present here but I think is an essential element, and

3

that is the element of imminence of the risk, urgency of

4

the risk.

5

for a perceived urgent problem.

A quarantine is an emphatic and swift remedy

In fact in the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad

6

7

case on which Alabama relies, the Court described the

8

quarantine cases as essentially grounded in self-defense.

9

And. one of the essential elements of self-defense is

10

imminence.

11

there is an imminent harm.

one of the cases cited, it was pointed out that the

13

animals would begin to decay and cause harm within 24

hours.

The

16

hazardous wastes, as Mr. Pincus described, are subject to

a comprehensive cradle to grave Federal regulatory scheme.

18

From the time of generation through storage through

19

transportation through treatment and disposal they are

20

subject to a uniform minimum set of standards which can be

21

supplemented by the states precisely to guard against

22

those sorts of imminent risks.

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

I don't know whether it would be

13

weighty indeed, because Congress has, by taking this

problem firmly in hand and by treating what might

15

otherwise be a local activity such as the generation of

16

waste in the same way that raising cattle might ordinarily

17

be local, but by taking it entirely in hand in this

problem.

are often capital intensive, and it would be duplicative

1

authorizing taxes, even discriminatory taxes, or other

2

incentives, can take steps that are necessary to make sure

3

the adequate capacity is present.

4

But that has not happened here, and Alabama

5

instead has tried to take matters into its own hands by

6

adopting what it thinks is a proper regulation of what is

7

after all interstate commerce, by imposing a tax at a

8

level it thinks is appropriate to regulate, as it were,

9

the movement of goods from one state to another.

That's a

10

function that's assigned to Congress under the Commerce

11

Clause, not to the states.
And I think that gets to the reason why a tax

12

13

rather than a ban, even though it may seem lesser

14

included, doesn't survive on the quarantine theory.

15

because the state, the state's interest is much more

But if there

1

2

that was consistent with the state's interest.

total ban was premised on the kind of imminent danger,

Most of the harms that Alabama cites in here

speculative at that.

13

those purposes the State is essentially second guessing

to address this across the board, that the same statute

20

of operation, 17.5 months, is that the ratio of out-of-

state waste to in-state waste has actually slightly

22

increased, going from an average of 85 to 90 percent to 89

MR. NETTLES:

No, sir.

The effect of it has

3

been to reduce the volumes, to reduce the volumes of

4

hazardous waste coming in at a staggering proportion,

5

almost 800,000 tons that had been increased over 200

6

percent in the years, immediate years preceding this.

7

the second is to compensate Alabama for the total problems

that would result from both the short range, financial

in monitoring, and in the eventual remediation, clean up,

And you

Mr. Nettles -Yes, sir.

It's a very sensible way to allocate

the limited portion of your landfill that you want to go
to out-of-state hazardous waste to use the rationing

mechanism of price.

11

efficient, and indeed the out-of-state people who most

12

need‘it would use it if you use a high price.

13

Unfortunately that rationing mechanism runs a real risk of

14

being abused, and maybe we should adopt a Commerce Clause

15

principle that if you wanted to exclude it entirely,

16

that's okay, or even if you wanted to place a certain

17

tonnage limit on out-of-state, that might be okay.

18

here you've used price, and as far as we know you may just

be doing this just to milk out-of-staters, just as has

been done in other Commerce Clause cases.

another rationale, namely an expansion of the quarantine

MR. NETTLES:

That, Your Honor, that coupled

11

with the difference, the threat in difference and the

nature of the risk because of the fact that the volumes

change them.

No, sir.

You just said you couldn't satisfy

the normal Commerce Clause test.

MR. NETTLES:

Well, because what we're showing

is that on its face it may be discriminatory, but in the

practical effect it is not.

it, the test that was applied in Wyoming v. Oklahoma.

Honor, because the practical effect of what Alabama -QUESTION:

Well, why isn't there a non-

discriminatory way of controlling the volume of hazardous

5

waste, that you're willing to put up with in your state?

6

MR. NETTLES:

We respectfully submit that this

7

is in its practical effect not discriminatory because of

8

the fact that the nature of the risk is different because
of the tremendous volumes coming in from out-of-state, and

10

you have a balancing test, we submit, that would be the

11

more, that has been recognized and would be appropriate in

12

this instance where you balance the risk and burdens to

13

Alabama as opposed to the risk and burdens of outside.

14

And I would suggest this.

That the approach

15

being taken by Alabama is something that is certainly, the

16

credibility of it is certainly strengthened by the fact

17

that you have the National Governors' Association, the

18

National Council of State Governments, and the five other

national, state, and municipal organizations which have

joined together.

a complete red herring.
