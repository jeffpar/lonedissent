ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. FELDMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case raises an issue concerning the proper

12

interpretation of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1).

13

Under Rule 804(b)(1) former testimony is admissible if the

14

party against whom the testimony is offered had an

15

opportunity and similar motive to cross-examine the

16

declarant at the time the testimony was given.

17

The court of appeals in this case held that that

18

express similar motive requirement was irrelevant, and

19

that the former testimony at issue here -- which was grand

20

jury testimony -- was admissible under Rule 804(b)(1).

21
22

23

QUESTION:

Did the court of appeals question

whether or not there was a similar motive?
MR. FELDMAN:

No, they did not.

The court of

24

appeals -- the only thing they said about whether there

25

was a similar motive was that they agreed -- I think this

is almost a quote -- they agreed with the district court

2

that the Government may well not have had a similar motive

3

to cross-examine the declarants.

don't think there's a word in the court of appeals

opinion, or in their later opinion in the case of United

6

States v. Bahadar where they attempted to clarify their

7

opinion in this case.

They didn't say -- I

I don't think there's a word in either opinion

8

that suggests that they thought the Government did have a
10

similar motive.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Feldman, the district court found

12

the Government did not have a similar motive.

13

correct?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

QUESTION:

Is that

That's correct.

Was that a determination that there

16

was no similar motive as a matter of law, or as a matter

17

of fact?

I think district courts would frequently -- and

should -- reach the same conclusion that the district

court did here.

QUESTION:

The court had sealed materials

Well, do you think it's an issue of

MR. FELDMAN:

10
11

And therefore,

Yes,

I do think it's an issue of

fact.
QUESTION:

12

And so on a case-by-case basis the

13

court would have to determine whether there is similar

14

motive.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that -- I think that as a

16

general matter that's certainly -- that's certainly true

17

under Rule 804(b)(1), as the rule would be applied to a

18

variety of different former proceedings.

19

I think in particular, with respect to grand

20

jury proceedings, the answer should almost always or

21

always be, because of the structure of the proceeding,

22

because of the nature of the inquiry that the proceeding

23

is undertaking,

24

that the Government did not have a similar motive.

25

that the answer should almost always be

and

1

considerations as to whether hearsay grand jury testimony

2

should be admitted against the Government or against a

3

defendant, I think that it's more profitably considered as

4

a general matter under Rule 804(b) (5), where a court can

5

look at the particular circumstantial guarantees of

6

trustworthiness and look at the whole situation and decide

7

whether there is some basis to think that the testimony is

8

reliable enough to be introduced at trial.

9

QUESTION:

Have the circuit courts discussed the

10

question of the test for and the definition of similar

11

motive, or is this still a very newly emergent doctrine?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

I think -- I guess -- I think it

13

would be fair to say that it's been seen as largely a

14

case-by-case factual determination.

15

lot of detailed legal discussion about what would and

16

would not constitute similar motive.

17

There hasn't been a

The factual - - the issue is whether the party

18

against whom it's offered had the -- had a motive to

19

cross-examine in the prior case so that that party fairly

20

can be held to what it did with the witness in the prior

21

case or the prior proceeding.

22

QUESTION:

If the Government decided that it

23

wanted to question a witness extensively in order to lay

24

the background for a perjury prosecution, but the

25

objectives were -- and the course of questioning was the

1

same as would be pursued in the trial, is that a similar

2

motive or a different motive?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

I think, if I understand the

4

hypothetical right, it would be a similar motive -- at

5

least -- if what -- if you have a particular piece of

6

testimony that someone has given, the question is what is

7

the Government's motive to discredit that testimony, and

8

what is the Government's motive to discredit it by

9

confronting that witness with a full cross-examination, as

10

opposed to by just introducing contrary evidence when the

11

witness leaves the grand jury.
And I think regardless of whether the Government

12

13

would want a perjury prosecution -- in your

14

hypothetical -- or for some other reason, if the

15

Government has a reason to fully -- to discredit the

16

witness' testimony and to fully confront that witness with

17

full-scale cross-examination, with full-scale

18

confrontation with the evidence against that witness, as

19

it would do at trial, then I think it would have a similar

20

motive.
QUESTION:

21

Mr. Feldman, can I ask you a question

22

there?

It seems to me there are two different ways to

23

phrase the question:

24

motive at all to show that the witness is a liar.

25

seems to me they clearly had a motive, but maybe that

one, does the Government have any

It

motive is overcome by other considerations.
Is the fact that other considerations make it

3

unwise to do what you have a good motive to do destroy the

existence of the motive?
MR. FELDMAN:

5

I would quibble with the question

6

just insofar as I'm not sure that the Government did have

7

much of a motive to discredit these witnesses.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, if they thought they were

lying, and that there really was this conspiracy, they

10

surely had a motive.

Maybe they didn't want to go ahead

11

and do.it.

were lying.

show that.

mind that a grand jury -- in a grand jury investigation

21

the issues are not -- they are not focused on particular

22

charges as they might be at trial, and there may be

testimony that's given in a grand jury that turns out not

bring an indictment in that - QUESTION:

15

Mr. Feldman, don't you think a

similar motive means similar in degree?

17

enough that you have some very slight, remote motive of

the same -- why would it make any sense to write a rule

19

like that if you have some vestige of a motive of the same

type -- although it is not remotely the same in degree?

testimony and look at all of its characteristics,

including the relationship of the declarant to the

defendants, to the Government, the circumstances under

12

which the declarant testified.

other factors that are worthwhile in looking at to

determine whether or not there's a circumstantial

guarantee of trustworthiness.

QUESTION:

There may be a number of

Well, Mr. Feldman, is it still the

17

law as it was when I went to law school and when I

18

practiced that the district court -- the trial court is

19

given a considerable amount of discretion in deciding

20

whether or not a particular piece of evidence is relevant

21

or not?

QUESTION:

Yes.

some of these questions either way, and should not be

1

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that's right.

Generally.

2

In fact, if you look at the decisions under the Federal

3

rules, the courts of appeals articulate the standard

4

differently.

5

standard or something like that, as to the degree of

6

discretion that a district court has to rule on

7

evidentiary issues.

8

9

But generally, it's abuse of discretion

In this case, I might add, the district court
had before it 9 months of trial.

It was quite familiar

10

with what the issues at trial were and the contentions of

11

the parties.

12

the sealed submissions of the Government.

13

arguments of counsel.

14

looking at the direct text of the rule, the district court

15

held that the evidence was -- was not admissible because

16

there was no similar motive.

17

It had the grand jury transcripts.

It had

It had

Based on all those things, and

The court of appeals kind of -- by holding that

18

it had to be admitted under Rule 804(b)(1), it put the

19

district -- it puts district courts in a kind of odd

20

situations since they have to decide -- notwithstanding

21

the fact that the text of the rule says similar motive,

22

they now have to decide when a court of appeals is going

23

to feel that fairness or something like that requires

24

that the text of the rule be ignored or, disregarded -- or,

25

as the court of appeals said in one place, evaporates.

1

I think the linchpin of our argument, and I

2

think the key point to make in this case is that the

3

rule -- the text of Rule 804(b)(1) is entirely

4

unambiguous.

5

The opponent of the testimony have to - - has to have

6

opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony.

7

It requires opportunity and similar motive.

The Federal Rules of Evidence were enacted into

8

law by Congress.

And absent a holding that Rule 804(b)(1)

9

is unconstitutional as applied to this case -- and there
«

10

was no such holding by either of the courts below, nor do

11

we believe any such holding is possible on the facts of

12

this case -- the rules must simply be applied according to

13

their terms.

14

The court of appeals said that the similar

15

motive requirement -- and, in fact, in one place they said

16

the.opportunity requirement, as well -- is irrelevant, or

17

evaporates.

18

Federal Rules of Evidence were enacted by Congress, the

19

specific terms of those rules have to govern in criminal

20

cases, and the district court was correct in relying on

21

the specific terms of that rule.

22

And we believe that since rule -- since the

What the court of appeals did was make up

23

exception -- a new hearsay exception, Rule 804(b)(6),

24

which is where testimony has been -- where a defendant has

25

hearsay testimony -- hearsay evidence that the defendant

5

I don't find any principle of that nature in the

why a rule of that sort would be a mistake to adopt.

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

The availability to the

4

Government, I think is of no consequence here.

I think

5

the court of appeals was mistaken about that.

6

they were right, if the -- the declarants were

7

declarants were, in some sense, available, theconsequence

8

of that would simply be that the evidence is not

9

admissible under Rule 804(b)(1), because 804(b)(1)

But even if
-- if the

10

requires, initially, that the declarants be unavailable.

11

So I just didn't -- don't follow that line of reasoning

12

all.

13

at

The court of appeals' error was not merely a

14

technical one.

15

hearsay evidence is not admissible unless there's

16

specific reason to believe that it's reliable -- either it

17

falls within one of the general categories which have

18

their kind of categorical guarantees of reliability, or

19

within the residual exception.

20

The point of the hearsay rules

is that
some

In the case of Rule 804(b)(1) that purpose is

21

served by requiring that the party against whom the

22

testimony is offered have the opportunity and motive to

23

cross-examine or to develop the testimony thoroughly.

24

where a party has had that kind of opportunity and motive,

25

it provides some reason to think that the testimony is

And

trustworthy, since it's been subject to cross-examination.

2

And moreover, the party has already done -- where it had

3

the opportunity and motive -- it's already done what it

4

would have done at trial, and it's not considered to be

5

that unfair to then introduce the hearsay testimony.

6

I think the court of appeals' holding eliminates

7

the motive requirement and substitutes nothing else in its

8

place.

9

hearsay rules, where there'd be some reason to think that

10

a -- hearsay evidence is reliable before it's admitted in

11

evidence -- instead of th^t, you have evidence that's

12

never subject to any guarantee of reliability or any

13

reason to think it's reliable at all.

So that instead of the standard pattern of the

14

And, indeed, in this case, the district court

15

held that the -- there was no circumstantial guarantee of

reliability in considering Rule 804(b)(5), and held that

they didn't think -- the district court held in

another -- I think in its opinion that's in the appendix

to the petition, that there was just no reason to think

MR. TIGAR:

That did not happen here.

The door-opening concept -- for

position.

The

Here the inconsistency is that the Government

claims in its case that a crime occurred, and it's holding

in the background, and keeping out of evidence the

23

testimony or statements of others that it didn't occur.

24

That was the situation in Chambers v. Mississippi.

DeMatteis, which is the only one that we have in the

about?
MR. TIGAR:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
That the similar motive requirement

evaporates under certain circumstances?
MR. TIGAR:

I'm saying three things:

First, I made my constitutional argument -- that
is to say that -- Justice White, as usual, said it better
than I did, formulating the issue, that the rule is
unconstitutional as applied the way the Government wants.
Second, we support the Second Circuit's position.

In this

case, given these transcripts, it's kind of hard to see
how the Government could ask anything they didn't already
get to ask.

So the question is hypothetical.

But there's a third point here.

And that is,

the Government in its brief tells the Court -- and it
stands up here and tells the Court -- that even looking at
804(b)(1), we don't think that grand jury testimony should
come in hardly ever.

We won't say never, but hardly ever.

Sorry to mix the metaphor again.

Maybe Gilbert and

Sullivan don't belong here.
But that is their position.

And I want to spend

a couple of minutes talking about that.
This hearsay, this prior testimony is the
strongest hearsay.

That is, Wigmore, and all the

commentators have said it.

making it not hearsay at all.

2
3
4,

Again, to return to Justice Scalia's question,
the similar motive requirement does perhaps invoke a
question of degree.

But there are so many cases about

5

similar motive out there in the wake of the rules -- many,

6

many, many -- that show that the motive can be relatively

7

derisory.

8
9

And I'll tell you if I - - I think after 25
years, if I showed up at a preliminary hearing and had a

witness on the stand for 3 days and made 10 document

11

requests to the witness, and then put another one on for a

12

day with a subpoena duces tecum, I'd pretty well expect to

see that testimony coming back against my client, if the

witness turned up unavailable later on.

MR. TIGAR:
QUESTION:

I have one other question, Mr. Tigar.
Yes, Justice Stevens.
I don't know if you've responded to

it or not, but the Government argues that the -- their
motive in maintaining the security of the grand jury
proceeding is of sufficient importance to negate the
similar-motive requirement.
I don't think you've commented on their emphasis
on the importance of maintaining the integrity of the
«
grand jury proceeding.
MR. TIGAR:

Their --we would not say that in

every case grand jury testimony comes in.
We would say that this hearsay, which is the
most reliable kind of hearsay -- developed before the
grand jury, which is the public's body and not the
prosecution's playground, ought presumptively to come in.
And that if the Government has a special reason, in terms
of grand jury secrecy, to prevent it coming in - - I think
the flaw here, as suggested by some of the questions is
that the defendants were forced to put a blindfold on to
argue about it.
That is, they were necessarily dealing in
hypotheticals because they didn't have the testimony.

It's not just

It is a body that gives them the power

to investigate -- the sole inquisitorial element in our
accusatorial system of jurisprudence.

And as in*

Andolschek, when they then decide to indict somebody --as
the Court has often recognized -- these considerations
evaporate.
The very case that they cite discussing grand
jury secrecy shows why that's so.

All of the Court's

decisions on grand jury secrecy -- the list of factors
that we cite in our brief are satisfied here in terms of
there not being any reason for nondisclosure.

background of this --of the case --

And the first one you discuss is the

MR. FELDMAN:

We did not think -- moreover, the

13

first point I actually was going to make is if you look at

14

the -- for instance, page 19A of the petition appendix,

15

the court of appeals' exact statement, and they only, I

1

While we agree that the Government may have had

2

no motive before the grand jury to impeach the all.egedly-

3

false testimony of Bruno and DeMatteis, we do not think

4

th£.t is sufficient to exclude the evidence at trial.

■fc.

5

I think that's unambiguous.

And they never

6

suggest, either here or in Bahadar or anywhere else, that

7

they thought the Government did have a similar motive.

8

They actually -- if you look at 24A, they make another

9

statement that something -- the same effect.

10

QUESTION:

No, I understand that's what the

11

court of appeals said.

12

was an issue here, or you wouldn't have argued it.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

But you must have thought there

Well, frankly, we thought that --

14

we knew that this Court -- it is possible that this Court

15

could reach an issue that wasn't reached by the court of

16

appeals, and we expected that respondents would raise that

17

issue, and wanted to provide --

18

QUESTION:

And really, we don't reach the issue

19

presented by the -question in the certiorari petition,

20

unless we're satisfied that there was, in fact, a similar

21

motive -- or that there was not a similar motive.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I don't think that's correct.

23

I think the question in this -- that question can be

24

-- can be answered, and that will dispose of this case

25

-- if it's answered as we think it should be, which is
51

if

that the Government -- the similar motive requirement is
relevant, and it's something that is required for
admission of testimony under 804(b)(1), the Court can so
decide, and the case would go back to the Second Circuit,
and that would require reversal of the Second Circuit's
judgment in the case.
So it's not at all necessary to reach any
similar motive issue, although I think that the similar
motive findings of the district court are well supported,
and the court of appeals apparently agreed with that.
As far as the immunity - - whether these
witnesses had -- the declarants had immunity at trial, I
think the answer to that is very simple.

The district

court --a pre-requisite for admitting the testimony under
Rule 804(b)(1) was that the declarants be found to be
unavailable.

And they were found to be unavailable

because they had made a valid assertion of privilege.
And if -- they had been immunized at the time,
or if their immunity extended to trial testimony, they -the district court could not have made that finding.

So

that's -QUESTION:

Well, do you disagree with your

opponent's representation that as to the witness DeMatteis
that the immunity extended to trial?
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, we do.

And as a matter of

fact he suggested that in the court of appeals we had

2

somehow conceded something about that.

3

think, incorrect.

4

at oral argument, we did state that we were authorized,

5

that we had the power, and that the trial attorneys had

the power to grant immunity to them for trial testimony.

That they -- in the court of appeals,

But that was never granted.

Was there a grant of immunity to him

for all future proceedings, or all further proceedings?

MR. FELDMAN:

The form of the immunity grant is

12

respondents -- as Mr. Tigar quoted it in the respondents'

brief.

But that was not --

MR. FELDMAN:

It could be a further proceeding.

I think it would be our position that we

The fact that the Government at one point

immunized them for grand jury testimony and for using that

grand jury testimony at a future proceeding does not mean

10

that that automatically would carry over.

11

In any event, that was an issue that, I think,

Unfortunately, one of those costs is not
wholesale revision of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

The

Government is as entitled to rely on the rules at trial as
the defendant is.
Rule 804(b)(1), by its express terms, would
render this testimony inadmissible.
