ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FELDMAN:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
This case arises from a suit for a refund of the

11
12

tax on the making of a firearm, in this case a short-

13

barrel rifle, by the respondent Thompson/Center Arms

14

Company.

21

22

to constitute a short-barrel rifle.

23

included a pistol, which is not itself a firearm under the

24

act, and a shoulder stock that converts the pistol to one

25

that can be fired from the shoulder.

So that you can make the short-

barreled rifle out of everything that comes in that kit?
MR. FELDMAN:

10

Yes.

The kit consists of a

11

pistol -- now, that itself is not a short-barrel rifle

12

because it's designed to be fired from the hand.

13

in the kit are essentially three additional pieces, a

14

Which makes it into a potential

rifle.
MR. FELDMAN:

That makes it into a weapon that

is designed to be fired from the shoulder, undoubtedly.

20

QUESTION:

What are the other pieces?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

The other pieces are a longer

22

barrel that can be substituted for the shorter barrel, and

23

a fore-end, a wooden piece that fits under the barrel.

24

QUESTION:

And that wouldn't be covered, either.

25

MR. FELDMAN:

Those pieces -- right.

If you

1

attach all of the pieces in the kit you have a long-barrel

2

rifle, and a long-barrel rifle is not itself a firearm

3

under the act.

4

That's correct.

QUESTION:

What the other side says is yes,

5

somebody could attach the stock to the pistol, but that's

6

not what it's sold for.

7

with a shoulder piece.

8

less than 5 minutes, too -- saw the barrel down -- so why

9

doesn't that come under the act?
MR. FELDMAN:

10

Nobody wants to shoot a pistol
Somebody could saw off a rifle in

That's correct, but as far as the

11

sawed-off rifle goes I think there's some important

12

distinctions between a readily attachable shoulder stock

13

that attaches right onto a pistol and a sawed-off rifle or

14

shot-gun.

15

rifle or shot-gun is not a firearm under the act.

16

for --to take the position that that was a firearm

17

because you simply could saw off the barrel would be to

18

mean essentially that all rifles and all shot-guns are

19

firearms.

First, rifles themselves, a fully assembled

QUESTION:

Now,

Well, what if you sold it together

with a saw?

Even if you sell it together with

a saw, a saw is not itself a part of a -- it's not a part

24

of a rifle.

QUESTION:

1

Well, what if the person manufactured

2

and sold an assembled rifle and an assembled pistol and

3

they were interchangeable in their parts so that it

4

could - - theoretically these things could be broken apart

5

and reassembled as a short-barreled rifle?
MR. FELDMAN:

6

Well, I think that's actually the

7

hardest case here.

8

argument suggests that the statute - - and I think the

9

statute could be interpreted such that that would be a

I would say that the logic of our

10

firearm.

However, I also think that in that case there

11

would be an additional consideration, which is what you

12

have is a complete rifle and a complete pistol, and

13

neither of those are firearms under the act.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, so what's the answer?
The current position that ATF has

16

taken, partly as a matter of its enforcement discretion,

17

is that that is not a firearm if they're complete and

18

fully assembled.
QUESTION:

19
20

But that's not perhaps logical in

light of your legal argument here today, is it?
MR. FELDMAN:

21

No, I don't -- I wouldn't say

22

that.

I think it is - - the logic of our argument could - -

23

under the logical argument the statute could be extended

24

so far as to read that, but the problem is there's

conflicting lines of -6

You don't have to have an intent as

to barrel length, that it be a short-barreled -MR. FELDMAN:

No.

I would say you have to have

10

knowledge as to barrel length.

11

to know, and it's unquestionable that in this case

12

respondent knew what the barrel length of its weapon was,

13

but I don't think -- and you would have to know in the

14

case of a parts kit that these other kits could be - - that

15

the shoulder stock could be added to the pistol.

16

You certainly would have

You have to know that what you have is a short-

17

barrel rifle, but what you -- you don't have to intend

18

that it be a short-barrel rifle, and in particular if

19

you're a manufacturer I think the manufacturer --

20

Thompson, in this case -- manufacturer's intent is really

21

entirely irrelevant in the sense - - intent as to what the

22

consumer is going to do.

Thompson has designed and made a weapon with the

intent is -- it just doesn't -- it's not operative in this

case so long as the parts are easily -- can be easily

assembled and put together.

QUESTION:

The record certainly doesn't indicate

5

that anybody - - any - - has anybody ever used this

contraption, if I may call it, as a short-barreled rifle?

Has any sportsman ever used it that

There'S no - -

MR. FELDMAN:

There's nothing in the record

about a - - that a criminal has used it.

16

QUESTION:

Why would you want a shoulder-fired

17

pistol?

18

you would want to saw off a powerful weapon like a rifle

19

so you can carry it more easily and commit a crime with

20

it, but why would you want to fit a shoulder piece to a

21

pistol?

22

I can't understand that.

MR. FELDMAN:

I can understand why

I mean, essentially the

23

prohibition on short-barrel rifles is based on the idea

24

that a short-barrel rifle is more accurate than a rifle

25

and yet more concealable than -- I mean, more accurate -8

That's right.
And more concealable --

Right.
-- than a rifle.

So this one would be no more accurate

8

than a pistol, I assume -- the barrel is not any longer --

9

but less concealable than a pistol.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

There's all -- I don't think

11

there's anything in the record as to precisely how

12

accurate this would be or whether someone would or would

13

not want to use this for criminal - -

14

QUESTION:

But Mr. Feldman, are there criminal

15

penalties for possessing -- I mean, this is -- as it comes

16

before us it's a tax case, but is it not the case that the

17

same provisions, the same definitions govern criminal

18

liability for possession of this thing?

19

MR. FELDMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes.

And don't we usually apply a rule of

lenity to criminal cases?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, let me actually -- let me

retract that yes and put it in two parts.

1

2

And do you concede it has to be

interpreted the same way for both?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

The question of what is a firearm.

4

There may or may not be additional intent requirements

5

from the basis of proceeding under one of the criminal

6

prohibitions that may require some further intent when

7

there's a criminal prosecution.
QUESTION:

8

9

of the Government?

May or may not?

Is there an intent requirement?

MR. FELDMAN:

10

What's the position

The position of the Government is

11

that the only intent requirement is that you know that

12

it's a firearm, that that puts you on - -

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FELDMAN:

15

That's what I thought.
I mean, excuse me, you know that

it's a weapon.

16

QUESTION:

Right.

So that if we agree with the

17

Government we're going to be interpreting this provision,

18

which is at least ambiguous, in a manner that's going to

19

make a crime what persons might readily think is not a

20

crime.

21

MR. FELDMAN:

Your Honor, I think that that

22

would prove entirely too much.

Like any other tax

23

statute, like other regulatory matters where there's

24

regulations that are enforced by -- or a regulatory scheme

25

that's enforced by criminal penalties, the fact that there
10

1

are potential criminal penalties lurking in the background

2

doesn't mean that the regulatory scheme should always be

3

interpreted against the Government.

4

QUESTION:

But haven't some of our cases held in

5

the field of taxation that even though we're dealing with

6

a tax case here, if there are criminal penalties then you

7

apply the rule of lenity?

8

9

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't recall any that have

specifically dealt with tax cases and the rule of lenity.

10

There are cases that talk about where there's been no

11

consistent regulatory interpretation of a statute - -

12

they're primarily older cases -- but that have discussed

13

the fact that you might then interpret a statute so as to

14

give fair notice to the taxpayer in favor of the taxpayer.

15

In this case, where you're talking about the

16

registration by a manufacturer of firearms, there's no

17

question that the manufacturer had sufficient fair notice,

18

and in any event, it's not the kind of criminal -- this is

19

not the kind of criminal prosecution where those fair

20

notice concerns are most prominent.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

But don't -- aren't you going to have

to interpret it the same way in a criminal prosecution?
MR. FELDMAN:

Again, you would have to - - you

24

certainly would have to interpret what is a firearm the

25

same way in a criminal prosecution.

QUESTION:

1

So why do you say those concerns

2

aren't present here?

They're not present in this

3

particular case, but we're giving meaning to language

4

which could ultimately be applied in a criminal case.
MR. FELDMAN:

5

First of all, I think the argument

6

that we're making is something that would be appropriate

7

in a criminal case, but if -- where you're addressing

8

criminal cases, the criminal prohibitions -- for instance

9

there's a criminal prohibition against possessing an

10

unregistered -- an unregistered weapon that's required to

11

be registered.

12

may carry some further intent requirement that's not

13

applicable where you're talking about whether you have to

14

pay the tax and register the firearm initially.

The term possessing there, for instance,

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

Although you deny that.
It is our position that there's

not - -

18

QUESTION:

It may.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

It may if you lose.

There's -- currently the courts of

20

appeals - - most courts of appeals have held that the - -

21

for the criminal -- in a criminal prosecution the intent

22

requirement is that you know that it's a firearm, that

23

that puts people on sufficient notice to know that they

24

should check and see what the legal requirements are with

25

respect to that weapon before they possess a firearm.

That's in the general sense.

2

QUESTION:

How do you deal with the Gould case?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

4

QUESTION:

The Gold -- excuse me.

Well, Gould or Gold, G-o-u-l-d v.

5

Gould, decided in 19 -- 1970, about -- saying that

6

statutes levying taxes establish a rule not to extend

7

their provisions by implication.

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

I think that -- two ways.

I think the language of this -- of the statute here

10

readily lends itself to the interpretation of that

11

proposal.

12

13
14

First,

QUESTION:

So you're not extending it by

implication.
MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

But I'd also say

15

that Gould is a case, and as are the other cases cited by

16

respondent on this point, where there was no established

17

administrative construction of the statute.

18

been numerous cases where the Court has dealt with

19

established administrative construction of tax statutes

20

and has deferred to the Government's interpretation.

there was originally a revenue ruling in 1954 which

2

applied to any firearm under the National Firearms Act and

3

said that -- essentially that whether the parts are

4

attached or not, they still would constitute a firearm if

5

they're all that are necessary to make it.

6

There were two revenue rulings in 1961.

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

It's our position

that that would be the same -- that that is the same case.

19

QUESTION:

That is the same case, isn't it?

20

MR. FELDMAN:

And indeed, if the Federal

21

circuit's interpretation of the statute were adopted, a

22

criminal or a gang of criminals, or anyone in fact, could

23

amass a cache of short-barrel rifles or other NFA weapons

24

simply by buying them in a partially unassembled state,

then attaching the final piece and going out and using

QUESTION:

Well, except for the fact that in

5

that case there's only one thing they would do with them

if they did anything at all, whereas that is not true

here.
MR. FELDMAN:

8

9

in that case.

Well, that may or may not be true

In fact, if this were -- if the Federal

10

circuit's interpretation of the act were adopted,

11

manufacturers could easily make weapons that are far more

12

sinister than the particular weapon that we're talking

13

about here -- weapons that are semi-automatic.

14

have higher caliber, and so on, that have some utility and

15

could be fired as a pistol, and then they sell them with a

16

shoulder stock that you can just clip right on to the

handle.

and people could stockpile them, and they wouldn't be

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

Receiver.

The receivers separately.

I mean,

that horrible exists under any interpretation of this law.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, but weapons could be

6

specifically designed and intended by the manufacturers to

7

be -- by a single manufacturer just precisely so they'd

8

have, for instance, the maximum criminal utility and so

9

that there's a piece or two that's missing when you

10

purchase them so that technically they're some other

11

weapon which someone may want to use for some other

12

purpose at that time.

13

So long as all these parts are segregated as a

14

unit, which is what the -- what respondent has said in his

15

application to pay the tax that was due in here, it is as

16

much a firearm as is a bicycle that you buy that has

17

handlebars that the ultimate consumer has to attach.

MR. FELDMAN:

Is that the way it works?

When they're associated together.

It's the same thing as if they were just making short-

go far back -- let's say they were specifically

manufacturing short-barrel rifles and nothing else.

There's some point far enough back in the manufacturing

which is where what they're making is a full rifle and a

It happens that there are some interchangeable

No -- the

MR. FELDMAN:

9

QUESTION:

You mention

Is my recollection

That'S correct.

And you said it was not significant

10

that the definition of rifle did not have any reference to

unassembled parts simply because what Congress was doing

12

when it included the unassembled parts within the meaning

13

of machine gun was codifying prior judicial decisions and

that's all it was doing.

MR. HALBROOK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

It is ATF's position that a complete pistol and

8

a complete rifle -- that is, two receivers, a short

constitute an NFA weapon unless actually assembled as

such.

It's a minor caliber.

However,

you can interchange these barrels -- that's a commercially

attractive feature of this firearm -- with other calibers

QUESTION:

Do you have to change the receiver in

order to do that?
MR. HALBROOK:

No, you don't, Your Honor.

4

That's the beauty of this particular kind of firearm.

5

It's only a single shot, so it doesn't have a different

6

mechanism for different calibers.

7

You can use the same receiver to have -- for example, a

8

30-30 --if you have it in the carbine version, you can

9

have 30-30 deer barrel, or you could use a 22 rim fire

10

barrel for like target shooting or squirrel hunting or

something minor like that.

12

QUESTION:
with that term.

You change the barrels.

What's rim fire?

I'm not familiar

What is that?

MR. HALBROOK:

Well, rim fire cartridge is the

15

smallest cartridge made, and it only means that the firing

16

pin hits the rim of the cartridge to make it go off,

17

whereas most bigger calibers have a center fire which hits

the primer - -

19

QUESTION:

I see.

The pin goes through, yes.

And it would create some problems if

as you say, there are possession laws as well, and every

time the owner who buys these things assembled, which

16

wouldn't be a violation, when he takes the two apart to

clean them he is suddenly in possession of an unlawful

firearm.

MR. HALBROOK:

Not only that -- that's accurate,

Justice Scalia.

Not only that, but ATF is well aware that

21

the attractive feature of the Contender system is that you

can change the barrel, so you're always changing barrels,

That's getting a lot closer to

10

include the term intended to be fired from the shoulder.

11

So that's getting in a very gray area, and I would think

12

that a manufacturer would not want to do something like

13

that.

doesn't want to take a lot of chances.

If the statute with criminal penalty says that to apply it

QUESTION:

have held that you don't even have to know it's an NFA

1

and if this statute really means what the Government says,

2

all of those carbine kits that are possessed with those

3

pistols -- these were sold by other companies -- all these

4

tens of thousands of people are guilty of a felony

5

offense, because there's no knowledge requirement in most

6

circuits that you know that it's an NFA firearm, and if

7

the difference here is that you're supposed to know it's

8

an NFA firearm because only one receiver is present rather

9

than two receivers being present, all these distinctions

10

that really are not in the statute but the agency

11

invented, then we've got a real problem with notice and

due process and issues like that.

Well, it's not just the purchases of

17

MR. HALBROOK:

If what the Government has said

18

for the first time here today -- if that's accurate, then

19

that's a real problem, because Thompson/Center has been

20

marketing these kits -- not kits, but complete carbines

21

and complete pistols -- since 1985 when BATF Director

22

Steven Higgins ruled that that was not an NFA firearm,

23

that one person in possession of both complete guns does

24

not possess an NFA firearm.

start using terms like separate marketing of these items

2

as if they've got to go to different people, but the

administrative record, the record in this case, is clear

that the complete rifle and the complete pistol being

QUESTION:

Justice -- well, how would you

address Justice Stevens' problem, though?

cause of no concern with respect to this firearm, but I

can conceive of another firearm that indeed it is an easy

10

means of evading the statute to simply sell

11

interchangeable parts like this.

12

It really is a

What would you say, that Congress should just

13

pass a law that would enable these to be addressed by the

14

regulating agency weapon by weapon?

15

MR. HALBROOK:

I don't think Congress -- well,

16

it certainly hasn't passed such a law, but I would say

17

that that's why it's important, in applying law to facts

18

as we're doing here, to look at the facts of the specific

19

case, and if we interpret the statute narrowly to exclude

20

this item from the National Firearms Act, we don't do

21

anything about all these potential hypotheticals that the

22

QUESTION:

Our problems are your problems.

2

MR. HALBROOK:

3

I want to point out just a little bit has been

-- in the one in the case at bar.

4

said about the rules of construction, about criminal

5

statutes, taxing statutes, and the term deference perhaps

6

might be addressed briefly.

7

We've argued two rules of construction, namely

8

that a taxing statute, if it's ambiguous, as we believe

9

the Government has manufactured ambiguity here, but then

10

it does -- it's interpreted in favor of the taxpayer and

11

against the Government, and the reasoning in the Gould

12

case and in the White v. Aaronson case and others decided

13

by this Court is that if Congress wants to tax something

14

it should say so explicitly, that the application of law

15

to fact should be clear enough so that people can obey the

16

law.

17

But the more important rule I believe is the

18

rule that this Court in the Crandon case last term

19

addressed, the rule that an ambiguous term in a criminal

20

statute has to be interpreted according to the rule of

21

lenity against the Government and in favor of the person

22

to whom it may apply.

24

1

defer to the Government in respect to a statute with

2

strong criminal penalties, which would, in Justice

3

Scalia's words, replace the rule of lenity with a rule of

4

severity.

5

But even if we get into the deference rule, then

6

let me say this.

The Government always cites the second

7

part of the two-part test that Chevron USA discusses.

8

first part of that test is that if the statute is clear

9

then there is to be no deference to agency opinion.

10

Congress has spoken, and no deference is appropriate.

11

It's only if a statute's ambiguous, and even then those

12

cases are decided in civil matters, in matters without

13

severe criminal consequences.

14

The

The example - - the actual case that I think

15

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist was referring to about a rule

16

of lenity being applied in a tax case was Commissioner v.

17

Acker, where that was not even a criminal penalty.

18

a strong civil penalty, however, and the rule of lenity

19

was held still to apply, because the conduct was being

20

punished even with the civil penalty.

21

It was

But if - - even if we were to defer to the

22

Government's interpretation, when you look at how the

23

Government has interpreted this statute, how the agency

24

interpreted the statute, particularly just after passage

of the Gun Control Act of 1968 when the agency -- well,

What do you say is the intent

MR. HALBROOK:

10

The intended-to-be-fired-from-

11

the-shoulder part of rifle -- the definition of rifle, and

12

we say it's exactly what it says, a requirement that the

13

Government prove that the item is intended to be fired

14

from the shoulder, so that, for example, if here the only

15

thing that's ever being made is a long-barrel rifle,

16

21-inch barrel, and a pistol with a 10-inch -- I'm sorry,

17

the rifle has a 21-inch barrel, the pistol has a 10-inch

18

barrel -- that's the way those parts are intended to be

19

used.

20

As I see it, the Government has three hurdles in

21

the statutory definition:

intended to be fired from the

22

shoulder, it's got to be a weapon, not a pile of parts --

23

it's got to be operable as a weapon -- and the make

requirement, or the made requirement.

13

MR. HALBROOK:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, you do.

So those arguments really don't carry

15

the day for you, it seems to me, unless you're willing to

16

say those revenue rulings are wrong, but you might well be

17

right on the intend-to-be-fired-from-the-shoulder because

this can be used either way, with the pistol handle or

with the shoulder stock.

MR. HALBROOK:

Well, I think the instant

attachability at least is a factor, the fact that it's

10

designed and intended to be done.

11

here, because here we're dealing with items that are

12

intended to be made only as a pistol or a long-barreled

13

rifle.

14

And that's not the case

So there's a lot of metaphysical issues about

15

the application of law to facts, but I think that, as

16

applied to this product, it's clear enough that the

17

statute doesn't apply.

18

Just another comment about the deference rule,

19

because we were talking about the fact that during the

20

period 1971 through 1985 the Government said that the

21

products here are not - - the types of products here are

22

not encompassed in the National Firearms Act.

later.

2

1985, for the first time as we can determine, the agency-

3

held that a pistol and carbine kit is a regulated NFA

4

firearm, even though it had held numerous times before

5

that those items do not constitute an NFA firearm.

6

And we feel like that's what happened here.

In

I would also point out in my remaining time that

7

the statutory definitions -- we've talked a little bit

8

about the contrasting definition of machine gun, for

9

example, from a rifle.

There are also two other terms in

10

the statute that are defined in terms of combinations of

11

parts, but only if intent is present, and again that goes

12

against the Government's theory here that there's some

13

kind of absolute liability combination of parts definition

14

with no intent that applies to every NFA firearm.

15

Specifically, the term destructive device, for

16

example, is defined as a combination of parts, as long as

17

those parts are designed or intended to be assembled into

18

a destructive device, and that's -- Congress recognizes

19

there's parts that can go together in legitimate ways, as

20

well as ways that would be, let's say, taxable under the

21

National Firearms Act.

22

With the Government's theory of this case about

23

a strict liability combination of parts, we would all have

24

destructive devices in our homes because destructive

25

device, for example, was defined to include a bomb, and

that includes a Molotov cocktail, which is made out of a

2

bottle, a rag, and gasoline.

3

4

So to avoid results like that Congress has

Those are parts that we all

5

fashioned really three kinds of definitions in the

6

National Firearms Act.

7

one that the Government argues for here today as to all

8

NFA arms, but it really only applies to machine guns.

9

Capability is the only test in that definition, whether

10
11

One of those definitions is the

the parts can be assembled to a machine gun.
Then there's the two NFA firearms that are

12

defined only in terms of combinations of parts as long as

13

intent and/or design are shown, and that's the destructive

14

device example, or the silencer.

15

And lastly would be, for example, a rifle, which

is not defined in terms of a combination of parts, with or

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FELDMAN:

6

I'd like to just make a couple of

7

brief points.

One is, there was a lot of discussion about

8

the administrative construction of the statute.

9

address that in our reply brief at pages 7 to 13.

We

10

Respondent's point primarily rests on a bunch of

11

unpublished letters written by subordinate officials at

12

BATF.

13

Even among those, I fail to see any

14

inconsistency except for one letter that was written in

15

1973, which we informed him in 1985 was incorrect.

16

event, there's a statute that says those unpublished

17

letters are not to be relied on or cited as precedent.

In any

18

What we are citing as precedent for the

19

established administrative construction that makes exactly

20

the kinds of distinctions that we've been making here, is

21

a series of revenue rulings.

Again, we explain those in

22

our reply brief at 7 to 13.

Those are published rulings,

23

and under the statute and regulations they are to be cited

24

as precedent and intended to be as - - a precedent.

language in the statute with respect to machine guns and

2

some of the other devices, these -- every -- it is true

3

that what respondent has argued, which is that each of

4

these attempts to modify the National Firearms Act have

5

been -- involved hard-fought compromises.
The fact that Congress overhauled the machine

6

7

gun definition in 1968 and added an entirely new

8

definition of destructive devices which was not there

9

before and in the course of those two things specified

10

exactly what kinds of combinations of parts and in the

11

case of machine guns what other individual parts not in

12

combination were included and were not, I don't think it's

13

fair to read from that that they intended to restrict or

14

modify the -- what, from established administrative and

15

judicial construction, the meaning of the statute had been

16

prior to that time.

17

I just -- it's not a case -- it's really a case

18

of trying to infer something from congressional silence,

19

wouldn't infer what respondent infers from it in this
