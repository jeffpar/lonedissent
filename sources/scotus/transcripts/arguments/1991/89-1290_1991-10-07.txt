ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The two questions presented by this case are

12

squarely and cleanly framed by the district court's

13

findings of fact.

14

System has been subject to a Federal desegregation order

15

formulated principally by the Department of Health,

16

Education and Welfare, and containing two core features:

17

neighborhood school system attendance zones and the

18

immediate and complete abolition of all racially --of the

19

six racially identifiable schools that existed as of 1969.

20

Since 1969, the DeKalb County School

Beginning almost immediately after the entry of

21

that order, DeKalb County, which borders Atlanta

22

immediately on the east, experienced population shifts

23

described by one expert as one of the most largest and

24

most rapid ever observed anywhere.

through 1986, the percentage of black students served by

this school district increased from slightly over

2

5 percent to almost 50 percent, with a disproportionately

3

high concentration in the southern part of the county.

4

The district court found, in response to

5

petitioners' request to be relieved of further judicial

6

relief under the 1969 order, that the racial imbalances

7

which had resulted in the schools were "the result of.

8

demographic shifts" which could again, quote -- which

That is correct, until such time as

MR. LEE:

How long was that?
Almost immediately.

has just continued since that time, and it continues

MR. LEE:

1

That is correct.

Actually this was a

2

very clean approach that HEW took.

3

that was needed.

4

DeKalb was able to just eliminate those six black schools,

5

which had always been the principal problem, and then that

racial imbalance came about as a result of the

demographics.

That was really all

Unlike most of the southern districts,

QUESTION:

But the subsequent

Would you agree that the school

10

district had the obligation at the outset in 1970-71 to

11

correct that imbalance?
MR. LEE:

12

13

Yes.

And I think to leave it in place

for a time to see what it was that might happen.

14

QUESTION:

So is what you are saying that there

15

is really at least a two-phase aspect to the remedial

16

period:

17

balance regardless of the cause, plus a disengagement

18

phase that follows it, and that you are now in the

19

disengagement phase?

20

going to tell us?

21

a primary phase in which there must be racial

MR. LEE:

Does that summarize what you are

What we're saying is that there was

22

compliance with the order as of 1969.

The court, in fact,

23

determined that for a time there was what you would under

24

any circumstance desegregation.

25

were these demographic shifts, over which the district

QUESTION:

And yet there was total segregation

Almost, yes.
To 1966.
Yes, that is correct.
Mr. Lee, did the district court

consider the possibility that the demographic changes in

10

the seventies were attributable somehow to racially

11

identifiable schools in the district?
MR. LEE:

12

As I read his order, that is simply

13

not consistent with any of the findings that he made.

14

What he said was in essence - QUESTION:

that.

But no finding really dealt with

So we're not sure?

17

MR. LEE:

No, it happens that he did not make

18

that specific finding.

19

regardless of whether the school district had taken the

20

steps that years down the road the respondent said he

21

should have taken, that it wouldn't have made any

difference in as far as the racial mix in the schools was

concerned.

caused by demographic factors, that the school district

2

had a duty to realign the attendance zones to cause racial

3

balance to the extent practical?

4

MR. LEE:

Well, that really wasn't this case.

5

Because in this case we were in balance within a short

6

period of time after the entry of the order.

7

question that you're asking, which is a hypothetical in

8

this case, is a much more difficult one.

circumstances, the order has existed for 22 years.

16

the district court, consistent with these findings that it

made, retained jurisdiction over two issues which are not

Rather,
The

1

first, contrary to the district court, the court of

2

appeals squarely held that the school district is legally

3

responsible for what it referred to as segregation caused

4

by demographic changes, so long as they occur during the

5

pendency of a desegregation decree.

6

And second, the Eleventh Circuit held that a

7

school district cannot attain relief from judicial

8

supervision in one respect without qualifying at the same

9

time in all six of the so-called Green factors, and for a

10
11

period of at least 3 years.
It's important to clarify at the outset that

12

this is not a case like Dowell last term.

case in which we are asking the Court for any present

14

ruling that we have reached the end of our judicial

remedial road.

QUESTION:

This is not a

19

whether you think the Green factors represent distinct

20

constitutional violations or is there a single violation

21

that we're dealing with?

MR. LEE:

And I'd like to ask

I think this is a concern.

Yes, it is an important question,

23

Justice O'Connor.

It's more helpful to me to look at

24

those as kind of guidelines, as indicators among the

25

things that you might look at, but it is a single

indicator.
And that is why I regard that second issue as

much more important -- much less important, and really

4

following from the first.

5

asking for, the only thing we're asking for from this

6

Court is relief from a new expanded order imposed after we

7

had been operating under the old one for 16 years, an

8

order which said by its terms that it was to be final and

9

terminal.

Because what we are really

With the new expanded features, greatly

10

expanded, aimed exclusively at features --at

11

circumstances over which we have no control and which we

12

did not cause.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Lee, may I ask you a question

14

here?

15

challenge, or maybe you do, the figures that the red brief

16

contains in the early part of the brief that are not

17

covered by the findings of fact dealing with the period

18

between '69 and '75.

19

there's a trend of increasing the number of more than 50

20

percent black schools:

21

'71, and so forth.

Supposing, first of all, I assume you don't

And during those early years,

two in '69, two in '73, three in

My question is in 1969 or '70, would it have

23

been the duty, or would the district judge have had the

24

power to prevent that increased concentration, even if it

25

were attributable entirely to demographic changes?

MR. LEE:

2

QUESTION:

3

I think

excuse me.

That's the whole -- that's the

question.

4

MR. LEE:

Yes.

I think that would depend on the

5

relevant findings of fact that would have been made at

6

that time.

7

Now, in fact, we did not go back -QUESTION:

Well, I'm assuming the relevant

8

finding of fact is (a), it is attributable to people

9

moving into the county from Atlanta, and (b), there will

10

be as a result of that change, racially identifiable

11

schools only a year or two after the decree was entered.

12

And they asked for relief right there.

13

MR. LEE:

I think I would be arguing the same

14

thing, particularly if we could have had the additional

15

finding that we have here that there's little that we

16

could have done that would have made a difference.

17

Both of the court of appeals' rulings are

18

squarely inconsistent with the precedents of this Court.

19

With regard to the first, the issue of causation, starting

20

at least as early as Swann and very consistently

21

thereafter, this Court has made it very clear that Federal

22

judicial authority is limited to curing the constitutional

23

violation which gave rise to the Federal court's authority

24

in the first place.

25

There is no better way to say it than this Court

at eliminating a condition that does not violate the

Constitution or does not flow from such a violation.

QUESTION:

"Federal

Well, the constitutional violation is

6

that this causes a stigma to the entire black community.

7

And you're telling us in answer to me and to Justice

8

Stevens, that even if you have racially identifiable

9

schools within 1 year after a decree is entered and there

10

has been 1 year of balanced, that that's the end of the

11

Court's concern.

12

the violation extends beyond that period.

13

MR. LEE:

But it seems to me that the nature of

That proposition, Justice Kennedy,

14

that it is the stigma that is the controlling factor, has

15

been considered by the Court on several occasions and

never commanded a majority of the Court.

you can have in this case, which is that there still is

You will not have very many cases in which that issue is

of the cleanliness of the findings of fact.

5

I think the critical thing about then the way

this plan was carried out was that the school board was

found by the district court to be acting in good faith.

It sought to achieve the maximum amount of desegregation

that was practicable.

It instituted voluntarily two

programs in the wake of the demographic changes that swept

over DeKalb County:

program, which this Court identified in Swann as being a

very important part of the desegregation plan.

is no.

And what does dismantling mean?

I think it does

mean getting at the Green factors, those six aspects of

the school system, to make sure that no school is being

don't we have to see that all the Green factors are met

10
11

Mightn't one factor need remedies

If there's then initially a single violation,

for a period of time?
MR. STARR:

Oh, I don't think so.

Footnote 5 in

12

Pasadena looks very strongly the other way.

13

learning of three United States courts of appeals that

14

have focused on this and this is why.

this case readily agree, they conceded at the district

court level, that in three of the Green factors all

eradicated.

19

would be a violation of the limitations of judicial power

What you want us to hold, then, that

14

MR. STARR:

I wouldn't put it in that way.

I do

think that it does in fact raise a question that the

school board might very well say we have completed our

duties in that respect, nothing more needs to be done.

18

And then the critical judgment, and it is a judgment by

the district court, is whether that board is acting in

good faith.

21

Here, the court has the benefit of two judges

22

having concluded that this school board has been acting in

good faith since 1 6 .

before them have said this is a school board that is

seeking the interest and welfare of all of its students.

And the two areas where there is still work to be done are

areas that the school board already believes it has

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. HANSEN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. HANSEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the court:
There are three central and undisputed features

7

to this case.

8

was intentionally segregated on the basis of race for as

9

long as anyone can remember and up to at least 10 years

10

First, the DeKalb County School District

after the decision in Brown.
Second, the district court found it's undisputed

11
12

that the DeKalb School System has never been fully

13

desegregated, that there remain vestiges of segregation

14

even 15 years after the court -- after the school district

15

was ordered to cure the problems, and 30 years after

16

Brown.

17

And third, the schools in DeKalb County today

18

remain both separate and unequal.

19

attended by black students, who are disproportionately

20

taught by black teachers who are disproportionately

21

administered by black administrators, and those set of

22

schools have fewer resources than the schools that are

23

attended by white students, have white teachers, white

24

administrators, and have more resources.

resources?
MR. HANSEN:

2

The district court found in looking

3

at those schools that are disproportionately black versus

4

those schools that are disproportionately white that you

5

consistently find that less money is spent per pupil in

6

black schools, that the teachers in the black schools have

7

less experience than the teachers in the white schools.

8

QUESTION:

I'm just wondering how that could be

without a finding of discrimination.

Is it just that -- I

10

suppose, the principal factor is faculty salaries, and

11

there are just teachers who don't want to move to other

12

schools, so that you get more senior teachers in some

13

schools.

14

Is that the principal element?
MR. HANSEN:

The district court suggested that

15

was one element.

through just those factors.

them.

It inevitably leads to black schools

Last term, in Dowell, this Court said that there

were two questions to be asked in these kinds of cases.

7

First, has the school district engaged in good faith

found that in at least two instances that the school board

QUESTION:

Could I ask what if it was

19

unquestioned that the faculty had been appropriately

20

desegregated and that resources were equal, but

21

nevertheless, there was this student imbalance that was --

22

that had been going on for years, almost immediately after

23

the decree was entered?

24
25

MR. HANSEN:

What then?
Well, the obligation of the school

board in 1969 was to break the pattern of segregation.

1

And that pattern includes the coincidence of faculty and

2

staff segregation, and so on, going along together.

3

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that if the staff

4

and the resources are all -- have all been solved, and you

5

think the school board, nevertheless, has a constitutional

6

duty to reassign students to counteract the demographic

7

changes?

8

MR. HANSEN:

I don't think the school district

has an obligation to counteract purely demographic
10

changes, and that's not what we're suggesting.

11

and staff assignment patterns had been desegregated in

12

1 6 , if inequality had been desegregated in 1 6 , and if

13

the school district had maintained a desegregated school

14

system for some period of time in the 1 6

15

'75 period, I think we'd have a very different case.

16

QUESTION:

If faculty

17

would have been required to reassign students to

I thought maybe I could, though.

Well, all you had to do is say yes.

That wasn't as eloquent as one

swallow, which is not my phrase.

13

In order for the school district to prevail in

14

this Court, it must win on both of its propositions:

15

first, that the Green factors have to be looked at as

16

totally separate entities, and second, that there's no

17

causal link between current segregation.

18

QUESTION:

Well, is that, strictly speaking,

19

true?

The district court found the current violations to

20

be only with respect to per pupil expenditure and the

21

assignment of the teachers and principals.

22

the Eleventh Circuit ordered the district court to look at

23

all kinds of things like gerrymandering of school zones

24

and reorganizing grades and possibly busing.

25

certainly would be possible to say that those remedies are

Nevertheless,

And it

1

more extensive than the violations to be cured, that

2

there's jurisdiction in the district court, of course, but

3

that nevertheless, the remedies have to be tailored to the

4

problem.

5

MR. HANSEN:

I don't think there's any question

6

that remedies have to be tailored to the problem, but what

7

the school board's argument rests on is the notion that

8

the Green factors don't interact in any way, that they're

9

separate and distinct conditions.
QUESTION:

10

Well, I thought in response to my

11

questions that we got some response that conceivably they

12

may be interrelated and that the remedies, conceivably,

13

could be.

14

MR. HANSEN:

Well, I think the remedy has to be

15

what cures the pattern of segregation that has built up.

16

And if the faculty and staff assignments have interacted

17

to create a pattern of segregation, then I don't see how

18

you can involve a remedy that doesn't break that pattern

19

in all the areas of the pattern.
QUESTION:

20
21

22

But we don't have a finding to that

effect.
MR. HANSEN:

We do not have a finding.

I think

23

it is fair to say that the district court ignored the

24

possibility that the Green factors operated in

25

interaction.

And in the way he structures his

opinion, he appears to be oblivious to the notion that

they might interact together.

QUESTION:

Well, the district court --

QUESTION:

What do you mean by interact?

6

MR. HANSEN:

Faculty - - if a school district

7

assigns disproportionately faculty to one particular

8

school, that says something to the community about what
that school is.

That may have an impact on the student

10

assignment patterns that grow around that -- that school.

11

In this case what has happened is every single one of

12

these factors has operated in lock step.

13

is a school that's disproportionately black by student

assignment, it's also disproportionately black by faculty

assignment, in some cases, anticipatorily.
