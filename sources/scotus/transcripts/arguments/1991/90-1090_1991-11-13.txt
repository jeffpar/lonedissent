ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. MARZEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MARZEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

12

the Attorney General has statutory authority to require an

13

arrested alien, as a condition of his release on bond, to

14

refrain from unauthorized employment pending a final

15

determination of his deportability.

16

In 1983 the Attorney General promulgated the

17

regulation challenged in this case.

18

sentences read as follows; condition against unauthorized

19

employment, a condition barring employment shall be

20

included in an appearance and delivery bond in connection

21

with the deportation proceeding or bond posted for the

22

release of an alien in exclusion proceedings unless the

23

district director determines that employment is

24

appropriate.

exceeds the Attorney General's statutory authority under

2

section 1252(a) of 8 USC.

3

Attorney General may impose such, quote, such conditions

4

as the Attorney General may prescribe, close quote, on

5

release bonds.

6

That section provides that the

The court of appeals principally reasoned that

7

the Attorney General could not detain an alien for

8

engaging in unauthorized employment and that a bond

9

condition must therefore relate to insuring appearance for

10
11

hearings.
We ask this Court to hold that the Attorney

12

General's regulation is within his statutory authority for

13

three reasons.

14

further any of the purposes of the immigration laws .

15

Second, protecting American workers from displacement by

16

alien workers is a core purpose of those immigration laws.

17

And third, a bond condition against unauthorized

18

employment helps protect American workers from

19

displacement by aliens.

20

First, bond conditions may be used to

The text of section 1252(a) authorizes release

21

of an alien on bond containing, quote, such conditions as

22

the Attorney General may prescribe.

23

not limited by the text of that section to any particular

24

subset of the concerns of the immigration laws.

25

As the

1

decision in Toscano Rivis, it would be unreasonable to

2

construe the quoted language to mean that the Attorney

3

General may impose bond conditions which are totally

4

unrelated to the various purposes of the immigration laws.

5

But the reports clearly demonstrate a

6

congressional intent to grant wide discretion otherwise.

In particular, section 1252(a) —

QUESTION:
one question?

Mr. Marzen, can I interrupt you with

If the — and I know you disagree with this

10

reading, but if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the

11

regulation required that the bond condition be imposed

12

even if the alien intended to do authorized work, would

13

that regulation be valid, be authorized by the statute?

14

MR. MARZEN:

It would be perfectly consistent to

15

apply it even for authorized work as to aliens who are

16

authorized to work only by regulation.

17

In other words, the Attorney General could

18

decide that aliens in deportation proceeding who only are

19

authorized by his regulation to work may lose that

20

authorization if they are in deportation proceedings.

21

QUESTION:

What about the aliens in this recent

22

amnesty program where there was, where they applied for

23

amnesty and during a period of time large groups were

24

eligible for work that they might not otherwise have been

25

eligible for, say, about that group?

to show the employer, actually anyone is required to show

a green card or some combination of a couple of other

forms of documentation, like a social security card and a

The district director is essentially asking the

alien to furnish the same sort of documentation.

reasonable to require him to provide that information.

bond redetermination within 7 days after posting bond, he

can challenge the imposition of that condition while he is

free on bail and through all the avenues of administration

and judicial relief.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Marzen, is an alien who is found

15

to be doing work which is not authorized subject to

16

deportation on that ground?
MR. MARZEN:

17

It depends on the alien's status.

18

Frankly, 96 percent of aliens who are arrested and charged

19

with deportability, according to INS statistics as of

20

fiscal year 1989, entered without inspection.

8

depends on the status the alien has.

9

For some people who, for

So it

But the general answer to your question, Justice

10

O'Connor, is that it's not an additional ground.

I do

11

note, though, that the statute, once we do have a ground

12

for arresting an alien, the attorney, the statute,

13

1252(a), gives the Attorney General the authority in his

14

discretion to retake an alien back into custody so that

15

if, for example, an alien entering without inspection were

16

found to have been engaged in unauthorized employment, the

17

Attorney General would be entitled in that case, even

18

without the regulation, to take the alien back.

/

19

What the regulation and the bond condition give

20

us the authority to do is to hold the risk of forfeiture

21

over the alien to encourage voluntary compliance with

22

essentially a preexisting duty not to engage in work.

1

which there is an authorized work permit for the alien.

2

Why has the INS not amended the regulation to make that

3

clear?

4

MR. MARZEN:

Well, we want to enforce this

5

regulation.

And regrettably, the Ninth Circuit's decision

6

would prevent this or any revised -- the presidential

7

effect, would throw a cloud over any revised regulation,

8

because the Ninth Circuit where about 40 percent of our

9

immigration work takes place, has held that we, that it

10

simply is not a basis for either detaining'or using

11

detention as a lever against unauthorized employment.

12

that we have to hold individualized hearings, so

13

individualized that we have to treat each of these cases

14

as a matter of first impression, if you will.

15

And

And it's for that reason that we have kept on

16

the books, it's still codified at 8 CFR 10-3.6, this

That's correct.

Because --

Correct.
It makes it a double violation, is

all that happens.
MR. MARZEN:
the question.

I was — and maybe I misunderstood

I thought I was answering the question of

10

whether engaging in unauthorized employment was a separate

11

ground for deportability.

12

But a mere violation of the condition itself, you're

13

exactly right, would not be a ground for deportability.

14

And for some aliens, it is.

Section 1252(a) simply cannot be read as the

15

court of appeals did the first 2 times around and as the

16

respondents read it now.

18

contention that the predecessor to section 1252(a) was

concerned only with appearance.

To be concerned solely with

The Sixth Circuit, which wrote one of the

21

opinions under review in that case, held that the alien

General's authority was limited to insuring appearance for

not great significance the factor of probable availability

2

for trial.

3

Once you are beyond the appearance limitation

4

and, as this Court has held, can detain people for, who

5

are security risks or can exercise the authority under

6

1252(a) to further the public interest, prevention of

7

unauthorized employment and protection of the American

8

labor force against displacement by aliens is clearly one

9

of those purposes.

10

If respondent's contention were correct, it

11

would mean that the Attorney General could not revoke bail

12

or impose a condition on an alien who repeatedly engages

13

in unauthorized employment.

14

impose the standard mandatory condition that is injposed on

15

pretrial, on people who are arrested for crimes and are

16

released pending trial that they not violate a Federal,

17

State, or local law.

In fact, we could not even

If the authority in subsection (a) is construed

19

narrowly, the Attorney General would have even less

In fact, it's —

Could it be?
Yes, without question.

That is

6

an -- it is important, though, that to note that although

7

the Attorney General has had the authority given by

8

section 1252(a) for 40 years and has gone on record as

9

saying he has the authority for more than 20, he has

10

exercised it in a very conservative and measured fashion.

11

And has, in fact, the only condition that I am aware of

12

that he has imposed beyond ensuring appearance is to

13

prevent unauthorized employment, although he could

14

certainly impose this standard condition, the standard

15

mandatory condition that I just referenced with relation

16

to people released before trial.

QUESTION:

I'm just curious why, I mean, I

understand you don't want to bite off any more than you

have to, but why does the condition have to relate to a

not violate any State or Federal law, I'm not sure that

that's a particular purpose of the immigration laws, to

prevent violations of State or Federal law.

With respect to your particular question, it is

in fact a ground of deportability, not only violating a

Federal law, but violating a State or local one as well.

So that is within the various purposes of immigration

General that it must relate to the various purposes of the

9

immigration laws.

10

I'm simply actually defending, as I quoted at the

That doesn't give up an awful lot, although,

11

again, with respect to how that authority has been used,

12

it bears mention that for the two decades that the

13

Attorney General has been on record, he has only used that

14

authority to prevent unauthorized employment.

15

QUESTION:

I may be wrong, Mr. Marzen, but

16

didn't the majority opinion in the Carlson case suggest

17

that anyway it had to relate to some purpose of the

18

statute, the condition?

19
20
21

MR. MARZEN:

The Carlson majority said it, said

it had to relate to the legislative scheme.
Again, the legislative — now that section 23 of

22

the Internal Security Act of 1950 has been codified and

adopted for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality

That's exactly right.

purpose of the immigration law, although, again, this case

10

does not require the Court to plumb the depths of exactly

11

how far that authority goes.

12

authority that is at the very absolute core of the

purposes of the immigration laws and was, before the

perhaps address the Ninth Circuit's rationale in

particular.

21

They concluded that the Attorney General's

22

authority did not extend to detaining aliens for

unauthorized employment, and by analogy that the bond

With that, it's knowing that the Attorney

the chances of the Attorney General being guilty of

of deception are such that the Attorney General may, if he

also introduced all the anti-Communist legislation that

2

was on the books in the late 1940's and 1950's.

3

Congressman Hobbs introduced his first H.R.

10

4

in 1939 and every year for the next 10 years he introduced

5

legislation not just to detain every alien as you're

6

suggesting, but just to limit the detention of four

7

categories of aliens pending their deportation; criminals,

8

subversives, dope peddlers, and slave traders.

9

Just -- that's all that Congressman Hobbs wanted.

10

And anyone who reads the congressional debates,

11

it will become absolutely plain that despite year after

12

year of effort just to convince Congress to give the

13

Attorney General the power to detain those four groups of

14

aliens, just those four groups, that's what he was

15

concerned about, every single Congress rejected his bill

16

until finally in 1950 he backed down.

17

Congress, H.R.

18

said, I want the Attorney General to have the power to

detain just those four groups of aliens, but now I'm

willing to say he should detain them once they've been

QUESTION:

2

Well, Mr. — Mr. Schey, how then, if

3

that's your answer to Justice Scalia, how do you read

8 USC 1252(a) where it says pending a determination of

deportability, an alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney

General be arrested and taken into consideration, and one

7

of the alternatives is that he may be continued in

custody?
MR. SCHEY:

Well, Your Honor, I think that as

10

this Court stated in Carlson v. Landon, it said that the

11

Attorney General is left without standards to determine

12

when to admit to bail and when to detain.

13

words determined by their surrounding connections.

When dealing with the alien Communists, as in

8

these cases, the legislative standard for deportation is

9

definite.

And in fact, the detention language that we are

10

discussing here today appears for the first time in the

11

National Security Act of 1950 which specifically not only

12

defined Communist activity, it held that that activity

13

specifically subjected the person to deportation from the

14

United States.

thing that subjects one to deportability.

one of those persons -- and it is simply clear.

In fact,

8

in 1952 when the debates came to a head in Congress and

they were ultimately rejecting Congressman Hobbs' effort
