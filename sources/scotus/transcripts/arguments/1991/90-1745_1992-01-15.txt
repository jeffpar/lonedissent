ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY L. WAX

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WAX:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Under the sentencing credit statute codified at

10
11

18 U.S.C. 3585, which Congress enacted as part of the

12

Sentencing Reform Act, a defendant is entitled to credit

13

against a Federal sentence for certain periods he has

14

spent in official detention before he begins to serve his

15

sentence.

16

of determining the amount of credit that is due against a

17

defendant's sentence, that is the technical calculation of

18

the precise number of days the defendant has left to serve

19

on his sentence, is to be performed by the district court

20

at sentencing or by the Attorney General through the

21

Bureau of Prisons once the sentence begins.

22

The question in this case is whether the task

Here the district court refused to award

23

respondent credit against his 8-year Federal sentence for

24

approximately 14 months that he spent in State custody

25

before his sentencing.

The Sixth Circuit reversed that

1

decision, holding that the award of sentencing credit

2

under the 1984 statute is the exclusive province of the

3

sentencing court, which is to assign the credit at

4

sentencing.

5

Although respondent received credit for

6

virtually the same period against a subsequent State

7

sentence after he was sentenced in Federal court, the

8

court of appeals nonetheless directed the district court

9

to give him credit for that period against his Federal

10

sentence as well.

11

only must the sentencing court decide what sentence to

12

give the offender, but it must also take on what is

13

essentially an administrative ministerial function.

14

is the arithmetical task of figuring out the exact date an

15

offender will finish serving his sentence.

16

In effect, the court ruled that not

That

In the Government's view, the Sixth Circuit was

17

wrong to conclude that the statute makes this task part of

18

sentencing, that is a function to be performed exclusively

19

by the sentencing court.

20

not the sentencing court, that has exclusive authority to

21

calculate sentencing credit, a function that BOP has

22

carried out for 25 years.

23

that Congress decided to change the status quo and to

24

discard the preexisting administrative framework in the

25

Sentencing Reform Act.

It is the Bureau of Prisons, and

There is no reason to believe

QUESTION:

1

It did change -- delete the language,

2

saying that the Attorney General would determine the

3

credit, though, didn't they?

4

MS. WAX:

It did, Your Honor.

And the reason

5

why it did is something of a mystery.

6

sense explanation is that the BOP's role in this regard

7

was so well-entrenched, they'd been doing it for so long,

8

that Congress did not advert to the question of who is to

9

perform the function, they just assumed that BOP would.
QUESTION:

10

We think the common

Well, I think the most logical

11

reading of a change in the statute like that, where it

12

used to say the Attorney General will determine it and now

13

it doesn't say that is that Congress no longer meant for

14

the Attorney General to determine it.

15

it's the only reading, but certainly, that's the first

16

inference one would draw.

17

MS. WAX:

That's not to say

Your Honor, this Court has stated that

18

a change in language is just some evidence of a change in

19

meaning.

It is not dispositive of an intent to change

20

meaning.

And this Court most recently noted in McElroy v.

21

United States, where it found that a change in language

22

did not betoken a change in meaning.

23

inference from a change in language to a change in intent

24

is only a workable rule of construction.

25

infallible guide to legislative intent, and it cannot

It is not an

And the Government's

2

point in this case is that there is more persuasive

3

evidence.

4

language, the history, the purposes of the sentencing

5

credit provision.

There is an abundance of evidence in the

In particular, in the Sentence Reform Act as a

6

7

whole, the Congress did not intend to alter the status quo

8

that it did not transfer authority from BOP to the

9

sentencing court.

And just to begin, there are three

10

specific features of section 3585 itself that support our

11

view.

12

statute uses the past tense in a way that indicates that

13

the award of sentencing credit is to take place some time

14

after sentencing.

And just to summarize them, first of all, the

15

The second aspect of the statute is --

Let me just pause you right there.
Yes.

MS. WAX:

Well, theoretically you could do it

before you pronounce sentence, but -QUESTION:

Well, if you did it before, you

4

wouldn't know when the sentence was going to be imposed,

5

so that there would be the same argument about not knowing

when he is going to arrive at the jail, or the prison.

MS. WAX:

Your Honor, we think that our view has

support from the history of this statute.

The predecessor

provision, section 3568, that's where this language, this
10
11

phrasing, is borrowed from.

It's lifted right from 3568.

Now under 3568, that statute explicitly said

12

that the Attorney General awards credit.

13

we take the parallel language to essentially have the same

14

significance as it had under the predecessor, which is

15

that there's sentencing, and then when the person begins

16

to serve his sentence, there's an assignment of credit.

17

We think the parallelism is what's appropriate.

18
1

QUESTION:

And therefore,

But the difference is you don't

identify the person in the present statute.

20

What's wrong with reading the statute this way?

21

The statute requires that somebody make this calculation,

22

that at the sentencing time, the judge just says, is there

23

going to be any fight about the credit time.

24

everybody says no, it's all, you've just got so much time

25

in jail, then he could say to the attorney, well, you go

opponent's reading of the statute?

there is a dispute, I ought to resolve it.

be resolved -- while lawyers are here to write it out, it

7

shouldn't be resolved in the prison setting.

And then just say, if
It shouldn't

8

What would be wrong with that reading?

9

MS. WAX:

The problem with that, Your Honor, and

10

this is really central to our argument, is that there are

11

going to be periods of detention, periods of custody, that

12

come after the imposition of sentence.

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. WAX:

15

I understand that.
And there is no -- the courts are

not - -

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't the judge simply

say I want you to give credit for what's happened up to

now, plus whatever time it takes to get him to prison.

Are they going to be rules on which

6

the Government's interest will be different from the

defendant's interest?
MS. WAX:

QUESTION:
10

Yes, Your Honor.
And should they be therefore resolved

by a neutral arbitrator or by the Attorney General?
MS. WAX:

11

Well, the Attorney General resolves

12

them by applying rules that he has formulated and that are

13

open for scrutiny -- technical rules.

QUESTION:

But if the prisoner disagrees with

you, the burden would be with him after he's no longer got

a lawyer, he's now in jail, to come in and make an

appropriate motion.

MS. WAX:

In this case, did this all happen

before or after the Federal sentencing?

No, I'm talking about your

hypothetical example, or the one -MS. WAX:

My hypothetical -- all of this

14

happened after Federal sentencing while the individual was

15

on an appeal.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. WAX:

I see.
And there are other scenarios where

18

individuals can be borrowed from State custody for Federal

19

sentencing on a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, and

20

then they have to be returned to the State, perhaps to

21

stand trial or to serve a State sentence.

sentence by Federal court, and the beginning of service of

I mean, there are all kinds of situations.
QUESTION:

3

But again, why wouldn't that case be

taken care of by a sentencing order that said he's

describe as to be computed in the first instance by the

MS. WAX:

You're right that if that was the

18

system, then it would be possible to take into account

19

intervening detention, so to speak.

20

here in this case is we're trying to divine congressional

21

intent.

22

the system Congress created, not what is the system

23

Congress could have created.

25

But what we're doing

The question we're trying to answer is what was

Our argument -- what you're talking about here
is essentially a system of shared jurisdiction over

sentencing, because in effect the court can calculate to a

2

date certain the amount of credit due for anything that

3

goes before sentencing, but it can't do anything like that

4

for a period that comes after sentencing.

5

has to designate the Attorney General to do that for it.

6

And so essentially you're saying that there's a kind of

7

concurrent or shared jurisdiction.

In effect, it

The question is did Congress create a system of

8

9

shared jurisdiction knowing that there was a perfectly

10

workable, perfectly adequate, efficient, uncomplicated

11

system that came before?

12

is they threw that all over.

13

the system, and they didn't give us one iota of guidance

14

as to how the system was actually going to work.

example, can BOP revise the determination that the court

16

makes?

jurisdictional issues that come up when you have a shared

a hint that there are to be two entities instead of one.

2

And even respondent concedes that Congress did not intend

3

to create this complicated, redundant, inefficient system

4

when it already had a perfectly good and workable one.

5

QUESTION:

Do you take the position, or would

6

you take the position if we hold that the district judge

7

must make the credit determination at the time of the

8

sentence that you can revise an inaccurate determination?

11

MS. WAX:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, because of -If that's so, are we really fighting

about very much, then?

12

MS. WAX:

13

QUESTION:

Well, we're fighting -Why not just let the district judge

14

do whatever he wants and then you make a recalculation to

15

make sure that it's correct?

16

MS. WAX:

Well, we're fighting about what's

17

going to happen in practice when the courts try to put

18

into effect this system.

Are some courts going to rule

19

that the BOP can revise?

Are other courts going to rule

20

that they can't revise?

21

order to disorder, at least for a little while.

22

we're saying is Congress did not want to go from order and

23

uniformity to disorder.

QUESTION:

Essentially, we're going from
And what

And that's the inference.

Well, let me put it this way.

can revise.

I mean correct calculation by the district

court.

3

everything, isn't it?

In effect, then, the Bureau of Prisons is doing

MS. WAX:

QUESTION:

6

7

It is.
And what the district court does is

simply something that can be overridden?
QUESTION:

You run into a problem, United States

8

against Muskrat, where the district courts can't

give -- can't do purely advisory work if it's to be

10

11

reviewed by some nonjudicial authority.
MS. WAX:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Then it just

12

becomes an empty gesture on the part of the court and we

13

just don't see the point.

in doubt as well.

workable one.

16

QUESTION:

And the legality of it would be

I mean that system, I don't think, is a

Well, is your --do you rely chiefly

17

for the practical difficulties on the fact that it's not

18

easy for the district court to know what is going to

19

happen after the sentence is handed down and before the

20

incarceration actually begins?

21

22

23

MS. WAX:

It's impossible for the district court

to know about it at all.
QUESTION:

The district court does have adequate

24

knowledge of everything that happens up to the day of

sentencing, I suppose, by virtue of the presentence

1

report, and one thing and another.
MS. WAX:

2

It does, Your Honor.

But the fact is

3

that if the district courts are making a determination for

4

matters that are within its knowledge, we will still see

5

different district courts perhaps giving credit to

6

similarly situated offenders in different ways.

7

Another of our arguments is that we do not think

8

it's right to attribute to Congress the intent to go from

9

a system of uniform national guidelines where BOP had

10

worked out a set of rules for rather some complicated

11

scenarios that can arise.

12

was working perfectly well, to one in which every court

13

would reinvent the wheel on its own and have to decide how

14

to deal with the problems that come up in sentencing

15

credit - - and what that would do is it would subvert the

16

purposes of sentencing reform generally, which is to have

17

similarly situated offenders treated alike.

18

To go from that system, which

Now why would Congress want to go, as I said,

19

from order to disorder, even if it's only temporary

20

disorder?

21

QUESTION:

Well, if you're correct, and the

22

Bureau of the Prisons would still be calculating the

23

credits, what's the mechanism for judicial review of that

our main point, and I'll repeat it, is that what this
Court is here to do is to conduct an exercise in divining
congressional intent.

And we have to do that from the

clues that are at our disposal.

And the clues at our

disposal include the language and the structure of the
statute and our assessment of how the statute is going to
work in practice under various schemes that Congress could
have created.

And we have to assess those in light of

what Congress is trying to do in the Sentencing Reform
Act.
What Congress was trying to do was to bring
rationality and uniformity and consistency to sentencing.
And to make sure that similar offenders would get similar
sentences and serve the same amount of time.

QUESTION:

Well, the other side of the coin is,

of course, that if Congress had intended to change it, it

It is, Your Honor.

And the

weight we give to the substance of legislative history,

10

here we have no substance at all because nothing was said.

But interestingly, the legislative history says a lot

about section 3585 and the other changes that were

introduced into section 3585.

Now, respondent has several arguments against

2

our position, and all of them are easily answered.

The

3

main thrust of his argument appears to be that in

4

sentencing reform, Congress somehow wanted to place all

5

decisions bearing on the length of the sentence, including

6

the release date, in the hands of the court in order to

7

achieve uniformity and consistency in sentencing.

8

the problem with this argument is that it confuses control

Now,

over the total length of the sentence with control over
10

the actual release date of an individual offender.

That

11

argument, it essentially confuses passing sentence with

12

deciding how much of the sentence is left to serve.

13

It's important to realize that having the

14

sentencing court fix the actual release date in fact

15

subverts rather than serves the goals of uniformity and

16

consistency in sentencing.

17

that if the release date is fixed at sentencing, we

18

necessarily have to ignore any periods of detention for

1

which an individual would be eligible for credit under

20

3585 that come after sentencing.

21

periods into account, by definition we're going to be

22

moving the release date.

23

Now the reason for that is

Because if we take those

Now if we don't take them into account, it means

24

that similar offenders will in fact spend different

25

periods of time in jail depending on whether their Federal

3

4

individual spends behind bars for the very same reason.

5

Some individuals will spend an intervening period of

detention that won't have any effect on their release date

7

and other individuals won't.

And it means that the

8

So the bottom line is that it's impossible for a

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MARTIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We do agree in this case as to what the issue

14

is, and that is this Court should determine what Congress

15

intended for the determination of entitlement of jail

16

credits under the new act.

17

I will, before I begin my prepared remarks, try

18

to answer Justice White's question.

We reviewed the

legislative history, at least, for all the prior versions

20

of this particular statute once Congress began to consider

21

version of the statute, but each version of the

legislative history for that statute is the same as the

legislative history for the current statute.

versions except for the legislative history of the prior

I had not reviewed the prior

10

versions.

And there's no mention in the legislative

history on those prior versions of the Attorney General,

The -- our position, the position of the court

19

of appeals was that Congress in reforming sentencing in

20

Federal courts intended for the district courts to make a

21

determination on jail credit for a sentenced individual.

22

It's our position that that approach is not only more

23

logical and workable than the approach presented by the

24

Attorney General, but it is more consistent with

25

congressional intent as expressed in the legislative

The next thing the

court would do would then turn the sentence and make a

sentence and also decide whether it is concurrent or

more reasonable to interpret the statute in such a fashion

that you will be able to achieve what the statute says,

One such scenario would be a person who is

Is one of your concerns in this case

that the district judge should have before it the credit

can take that into account in determining the base

sentence?
MR. MARTIN:

12

Yes, sir.

that - QUESTION:

treated differently because if there is a credit that

14

arises by reason of detentions that are after the

imposition of the sentence but before it commences, the

judge can't do that, so then you are imposing on us a

regime where defendants are treated differently, which is

precisely what the Congress did not want.

made at some point in time, at some precise point in time,

either imposition of sentence or commencement of sentence,

For instance, if the line is to be drawn --

QUESTION:

Well, it's not arbitrary if the

5

Bureau of Prisons does it, because it's all after the

fact, and under the Government's position, the judge would

be encouraged to set the base decision without reference

to the credit time, which it seems to me quite a logical

design of the statute in any event.

MR. MARTIN:

And under your

There are two possible -- and these

12

are not articulated in the Government's brief -- there are

two possible alternatives the Bureau of Prisons make in

this determination.

the facts existing at the time of the commencement of the

sentence with no change after that.

One would be that they make it as of

The other scenario would be the Bureau of

Prisons making the decision and reevaluating or changing

the decision at any time during the service of the prison

21

in their brief, and that's the only scenario that I think

22

would avoid any possibility of an aberration of what

23

Congress intended under 3585, because otherwise if you say

24

it can't happen after commencement of sentence, then the

25

before that, you have this disparity only because of that

3

If this Court were to find that the Bureau of

Prisons should make this determination and that the

5

determination is subject to revision throughout the course

6

of the person's incarceration, then that's a result, I

7

think, that just goes directly in the face of everything

8

Congress was saying about certainty of sentencing and

9

certainty of release date.

I think that all of the

10

language talking about parole, about good-time credits,

11

where Congress says that these result in a prisoner not

12

knowing until the date that he or she is released what

13

that release date is going to be is contrary to the

14

purposes of sentencing as we see them.

15

important for the prisoner and for everyone to know at the

16

date of sentencing what that release date's going to be

17

subject only to reduction by good time.

That it's

So that the only absolute way to insure that

You don't suggest, do you, Mr.

12

MR. MARTIN:

No, sir.

Congress, in addition to

deleting the Attorney General from this process, narrowed

14

substantially the discretion.

There are two ways.

How do you

For one thing,

if it's on appeal and it comes back for resentencing, then

10

it can be accounted for at the resentencing, if whatever

11

is going to happen has happened during that period.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, let's say it doesn't.

There's

no order to resentence, they just affirm.
MR. MARTIN:

A couple of different ways.

If it

15

turns out that during that period of time the person

16

accrues additional time of official detention, which is

17

what the statute now says, that's not attributed to

18

another conviction, that can be remedied under 2255.

19

I think at that point it would be 2255 rather than 2241

20

because under my theory this determination is part of the

21

imposition of sentence.

22

district of sentencing under 2255.

23

25

QUESTION:

And so we come back to the

All right.

That takes care of the

case where he gets additional credit.

And

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

What if the event that transpires in

the interval is one that makes it clear that he is not
3

entitled to a credit that he might have been entitled to?

4

In other words, say that you don't know whether the State

5

was going give him credit for some time in custody, but

6

you find out during this interim.

7

that case?

9

MR. MARTIN:

What do you do about

I think that in that case that the

concern then is that he not receive double credit.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MARTIN:

Correct.
Now I think that that concern is

12

going to be resolved basically by the State court.

13

that there will not be double credit of the kind that

14

Congress sought to avoid - -

17

QUESTION:

Now you don't have a Federal answer

to that question under your approach?
MR. MARTIN:

No, sir, not effectively.

And I

18

think the circumstances where the State can't prevent

19

double crediting are going to be so unique and so

20

remote -- and I'm not even sure that it would occur.

21

can't say that they absolutely wouldn't.

22

particular, if the State had not wanted Mr. Wilson to have

23

double credit, they could have either made it run

24

consecutive, they could have increased the amount of time

25

that he was going to receive in his State time, they could

I

In this case in

that 429 days, even though the Federal court had given him

credit for that.
I think in the -- in the end analysis for the

vast majority of cases that will come before a court, the

6

resolution of this issue by the factfinding and legal

7

determination process of the court at the sentencing

8

hearing is a much more workable process.
QUESTION:

9

Let me ask you one other question.

10

Under your reading of the statute, would it be error for

11

the judge to say as of today it appears that this is the

12

credit that's warranted.

13

be resolved until after the appeal process transpires.

14

therefore order the Attorney General at the end of the

15

proceeding to make the appropriate disposition at that

16

time.

judge delegate the decisionmaking authority for these

18

small category of cases to the Attorney General to be

19

decided on the basis of the intervening events?

I

In other words, could he delegate -- could the

Would that be inconsistent with the statute in

20
21

But there is an issue that can't

any way?
MR. MARTIN:

22

It could result in an inconsistent

23

outcome.

If that were to result in that happening in a

24

number of cases, and the Bureau of Prisons handling that

25

question like they handle it now, where it takes months

1

and months and winds up having to come back to court

2

anyway, I don't think Congress would have intended that.

3

I think Congress would have preferred the decision is made

4

now based on the facts known to the court.

5

That kind of shared jurisdiction, I think

6

Congress probably actually didn't have in mind.

7

actually counting up days, you know, once the court

8

determines what the timing is, I think the Bureau of

9

Prisons will do that and Congress had anticipated that

10
11

Just

they would.
One last point I would like to make.

Of the

12

cases that have interpreted 3585 since its enactment, the

13

vast majority of the issues involved in those were

14

questions that were based on facts known at the time of

15

sentencing that were justiciable questions that the court

16

could and should have resolved.

17

nature of the detention, whether or not that equates with

18

official detention and custody, questions of entitlement.

19

And questions that could and should be resolved by the

20

District court at that time.

21

much more consistent with purposes of the Sentencing

22

Reform Act.

The questions of the

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

1

MS. WAX:

Just a couple of quick points.

First

3

of all, it's very important to realize that the sentence

does not begin in the Federal system at sentencing and a

delay between sentencing and the advent of sentence is

very, very common.

MR. MARTIN:

Would that be right?

All of these scenarios can happen.
QUESTION:

And even in those cases where it

3

doesn't make any difference in the sentencing, it at least

explains - - it leaves unexplained why the phraseology is

for any time he has spent in official detention prior to

6

the date the sentence commences.

7

MS. WAX:

QUESTION:

11

12

Exactly, Your Honor.

My second --

It's an unnatural way to put it if

this kind of a situation is common.
MS. WAX:

It certainly doesn't fit with the

language and it doesn't fit with the reality, either.
My second point, of course, is that respondent

13

does concede that some double credit awards simply will

14

not be corrected.

15

who through an accident of timing, get a second award of

16

credit by the State after sentencing will get to keep it.

17

The individuals who get the award against a State sentence

18

before their Federal sentencing will not get to have a

19

second award.

20

Congress could not have intended that result, which goes

21

against all of the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act.

22

There will be windfalls.

Individuals,

That's a completely arbitrary result.

And my third point is respondent makes a lot out

23

of the possibility of putting all the information bearing

24

on sentencing credit in the presentence report.

read the sections of the Sentencing Reform Act that govern
