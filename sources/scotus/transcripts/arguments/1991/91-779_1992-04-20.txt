CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 91-779, Burlington Northern Railroad Company
v. William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson.
Ms. Christian, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETTY JO CHRISTIAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. CHRISTIAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Montana's
venue law violates the equal protection clause.

That

venue law provides that a domestic corporation can be sued
only in the county in which he has its principle place of
business or in a case where a tort occurred within the
State in the county where the tort occurred.
The same venue law provides that suit can be
filed against any foreign corporation in any of the 56
counties in the State.

This rule applies even to a

foreign corporation that has been licensed to do business,
has named a registered agent, and has established a place
of business in the State.
Burlington Northern is this latter type of
corporation, and the reason that we're before this Court
today is that application of the Montana venue law has led

1

to these suits and a number of others being filed in two

2

particular counties in Montana in which suit would not be

3

proper if the suit were against a domestic corporation.

4

Now, I want to emphasize at the outset that

5

petitioners are not asking this Court to determine what

6

kind of venue law any State should prescribe.

7

strictly a matter for the State, and they are entitled to

8

make it as narrow or as broad as they choose.

9

position is simply this:

That is

Our

that a foreign corporation that

10

has been admitted to do business in the State and has

11

named its registered agent and established a place of

12

business there is entitled to the protection of the same

13

venue laws that the State chooses to adopt for its

14

domestic incorporations.

15

QUESTION:

And this is why, Mrs. Christian,

16

because of the equal protection clause of the 14th

17

Amendment?

18
19
20

MS. CHRISTIAN:

This is the equal protection

clause of the 14th Amendment, Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

You would say, then, that there is no

21

rational basis for distinguishing between a foreign

22

corporation with a place of business in Montana and a

23

corporation -- Montana corporation that has a principal

24

place of business?

25

That is our position, Justice

Rehnquist.

2

by this Court 60 years ago in the case of Power

3

Manufacturing Company v. Saunders, and thereare two

4

points that I want to particularly emphasizein the

5

argument today.

6

We believe that that basic issue was decided

First, that the Saunders law was squarely based

7

upon the reality of the substantial similarities between a

8

domestic corporation and a corporation that, although

9

incorporated in another State, has been what this Court

10
11
12
13

called domesticated in Wheeling v. Lander.
QUESTION:

Saunders was substantially criticized

and limited very shortly after it.was decided, wasn't it?
MS. CHRISTIAN:

The only criticism of Saunders

14

that I'm aware of, Justice Rehnquist, occurred in the

15

Starnes decision in a footnote.

16

Starnes had decided, in the context of a Texas

17

venue law in which geographic discrimination was not at

18

issue that in that particular case there was in fact no

19

discrimination at all in practice between the foreign and

20

domestic corporation, and in a footnote in Justice

21

Brennan's opinion he simply stated, citing three decisions

22

of this Court, that it is not clear whether Saunders is

23

still good law.

24
25

But when those three decisions are analyzed, one
of them -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Company against

i

establishing the standard that should be applied, and
2

3

simply went on to find that in that case, because o'f the

4

different statutory schemes that the State had enacted

5

related to foreign and domestic insurance companies, there

6

was a rational basis for the difference.

7

i

Brownell -- actually cited Saunders and quoted from it as

The second case was the Bain Peanut Company case

8

authored by Justice Holmes.

In thdt case, the Court held

9

that a venue law which established venue for a corporation

10

of any type, domestic or foreign, in any county in which a

11

■ cause of action arose, was constitutional although a suit

12

could be brought against an individual only in the county

13

of Donethal, and the point there was simply that there's

14

sufficient difference between a corporation and an

15

individual to justify the different treatment.

16

quarrel with that.

17

The third case cited was the Allied Stores case

18

in which the Court was concerned with a State statute that

19

provided a more favorable treatment for a foreign

20

corporation than a domestic corporation and thus did not

21

involve the issues of disparate treatment for one who is

22

essentially an outsider to the State.

23

So we do not think that those cases in any way

24

undermine Saunders.

25

was actually the first in a line of cases that has

QUESTION:

6

is it sufficient for us to decree that Montana must --in

7

effect the Montana courts must allow domestic corporations

8

to be tried in any county?

9

■

Ms. Christian, if you win this case,

MS. CHRISTIAN:

I think that the equal

10

protection simply demands that foreign corporations that

11

have been admitted to do business and in fact have a place

12

of business in the State be treated equally with domestic

13

corporations.

14

equalize this in any way that they see fit.

15

practical matter that a State legislature is unlikely to

16

ever adopt an any-county rule if it has to be applied to

17

domestic corporations.

18
19
20

Now, the State legislature could choose to

QUESTION:

If I may interrupt you, what do we do

right now?
MS. CHRISTIAN:

I think the answer would be to

21

determine that the equal protection clause requires that

22

foreign corporations of this class be given equal

23

treatment with domestic corporations and remand to the

24

Montana supreme court.

1

court has to plead that a domestic corporation resides

2

wherever it has its principal place of business in the

3

State, and so the equality would appear to be one o'f

4

permitting the foreign corporation that is also operating

5

a place of business in the State to have venue only at its

6

principal place of business in the State, but I would

7

reiterate that ultimately the decision is for the State

8

legislature and for the State courts, and that the

9

equalization that is required is simply equal treatment

10
11

for the foreign corporation and the domestic corporation.
QUESTION:

But you think it would be open to the

12

Montana supreme court to. provide the, as it were, the more

13

favorable alternative relief that in effect would get you

14

out of this county.

15

MS. CHRISTIAN:

We think that it would, and we

16

think in fact that if - - to do anything else would require

17

that they overrule their own prior decisions, holding that

18

the residence of a domestic corporation is its principal

19

place of business.

20

It might be illuminating, Justice Souter, if we

21

look briefly at how this disparity arose, because it

22

doesn't arise directly from the statute itself.

23

QUESTION:

I think maybe if I may interrupt you

24

again, maybe that's in part what was provoking my

25

question, and I may simply be wrong about the statute.

I

1

thought the Montana statute -- well, Montana had a statute

2

in which the domestic corporation simply had the power to

3

designate its principle place of business and that that

4

was binding for venue purposes.
MS. CHRISTIAN:

5

Am I wrong on that?

It does not appear to be that,

6

Justice Souter.

The statute talks about residence and

7

nonresidence, and the Montana supreme court decreed that a

8

domestic corporation resides wherever it has its principal

9

place of business.
Now, at the time this case arose and

10
11

historically, there had been no requirement that a

12

domestic corporation designate a principal place of

13

business.

14

That came -QUESTION:

So, in effect it's a question of

15

fact, it's not something that is, as it were, within the

16

control of the domestic corporation simply by putting the

17

name of one town down when it files its annual return.

18
19

MS. CHRISTIAN:

I think that's correct, Justice

Souter.

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

21

MS. CHRISTIAN:

Now, the requirement of

22

designating a principal place of business in the State was

23

added to the statute just last year, after this case was

24

litigated, and at the time that it was adopted the State

25

also added a definition. I believe the definition for the

1

domestic corporation is that the principal place of

2

business is where its executive offices are located, and

3

so the State itself has provided a definition which would

4

certainly be appropriate for them to also do in the

5

context of a foreign corporation.
QUESTION:

6

Well, what about a foreign

7

corporation, as would be the case for most of them, I

8

suppose, whose executive offices are not in the State?
MS., CHRISTIAN:

9

Justice Scalia, we think that

10

the concept of a principal place of business in the State

11

is one that has received widespread recognition both in

12

Montana and elsewhere.
QUESTION:

13

In Montana, for example --

But Montana has given it an

14

artificial meaning for domestic corporations.

15

corporation can have its major plant at one place and do

16

almost all its business there but have its executive

17

offices somewhere else, and it's where the executive

18

offices would be that would be the principal place of

19

business.
MS. CHRISTIAN:

20

A domestic

It has given it an artificial

21

meaning.

Our contention is that consistent with the equal

22

protection clause the State cannot refuse to give similar

23

and appropriate meaning to the situation of a foreign

24

corporation that, even though it has its national

25

headquarters elsewhere, in fact has a principal place of

2

business in the State.
QUESTION:

Well, why can't it say, you know,

3

just as with the -- we'll treat it just the same as’

4

domestic corporations.

5

of business in the State to be where your executive

6

offices are, and if they are not in the State, tough luck,

7

but we're treating you equally.

8

MS. CHRISTIAN:

We will treat your principal place

I think the equality would have

9

to reflect equal treatment related to the purposes of the

10

venue laws, and in the context of the considerations that

11

go into venue, a foreign corporation such as Burlington

12

Northern that in fact has a major executive office

13

presence in the State, even though its national

14

headquarters is elsewhere, cannot be treated differently.

15

The uncontroverted affidavit in this case,

16

Justice Scalia, shows that Burlington Northern has its

17

division headquarters in Hill County, Montana.

That's

18

headed by its general manager of the division.

Over half

19

of its employees in the State are there.

20

So our position is that, consistent with equal

21

protection, a State has the obligation to recognize that

22

the same factors that justify treating a domestic

23

corporation's principal place of business in Montana as

24

its residence have equal application to a foreign

corporation that in fact has a principal place of business

QUESTION:

Well, are you defining principal

place of business in the State for yourself,

Ms. Christian?

Certainly, Justice Rehnquist,

the State would have full power to adopt any bona fide

definition.

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, when you're talking now

10

about Burlington Northern having a principal place of

11

MS. CHRISTIAN:

This has historical precedent in

QUESTION:

I'm the Chief Justice.

16

MS. CHRISTIAN:

17

Historically, from 1893 up until the late 1960's

I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

the State of Montana required every foreign corporation

19

that sought to be admitted to do business in the State to

20

file with the Secretary of State at the time of its

21

admission a certificate that stated both its principal

22

place of business outside the State and its principal

23

place of business in the State, so this is something that

24

historically was recognized by the State of Montana.

1

aftermath of this Court's Saunders decision brought their

2

statutes into compliance with Saunders by adopting the

3

concept of a principal place of business in the State as

4

the residence for a foreign corporation.

5

the same time adopted a definition that would control what

6

that principal place of business was.

7

Others pleaded it as a fact matter.

QUESTION:

Some of them at

Others did not.

You're asking us, it seems to me, to

say that it is rational, almost necessary, for ^very State

10

to enact a scheme whereby foreign corporations have a

11

single, principal place of business in that State.

Now, that may apply to your client, but that

isn't the test under the equal protection clause rational

no office that can be equated to that.

21

This is not narrow tailoring, where your client is

MS. CHRISTIAN:

22

State, as Iindicated before, would have the power to set

for what it considers to be a principal place

25

a principal

place of business in the State, and if a

1

particular foreign corporation's contacts with the State

2

are not sufficient to meet that definition,

3

not fall within, but we cannot conceive of any bona- fide

4

definition that would not include Burlington Northern.
Our position is simply this,

5

then it would

and I think this is

6

the basic principle established by the Saunders case,

7

with respect to matters pertinent to venue -- and that is,

8

we're talking about trials in State district courts --

that

. 9

that there is no substantial difference between a domestic

10

corporation and between those foreign corporations that

11

have been admitted to do business in the State and have

12

actually established a place of business there,

13

if the court chooses to extend to its domestic

14

corporations the very great benefits that are attached to

15

limiting venue to the single county where it has its

16

residence,

17

that same benefit to those foreign corporations that have

18

been domesticated,

19

and also have what is reasonably considered a residence in

the State.

Yes,

but you're saying that it's

22

irrational for the State not to treat foreign corporations

differently on a basis of several subclasses,

25

treat all foreign corporations similarly,

quite rational,

and it seems

for the State to

and the only way

1

you can make your argument is by saying that some foreign

2

corporations have a principal place of business, but I

3

don't know why we are required to say that the State is

4

entitled, or is required to legislate on that narrow

5

assumption.

6

MS. CHRISTIAN:

I think the principal

7

established by Saunders which was carried forward in cases

8

such as 'Searle v. Cohn is that in the modern world the

9

concept of a foreign corporation includes two very

10

distinct and very different types of corporations with

11

respect to their relationship with the State.

12

One of them is those that can be treated as - -

13

can be considered to be truly foreign.

14

that have only transitory relationships, if any, with the

15

State, and they're entitled to be treated quite

16

differently from domestic corporations.

17

That is, those

But in the modern world of multi-State

18

businesses there is another very large category of

19

corporations which happen to be incorporated in another

20

State, many of them like Burlington Northern and Delaware,

21

which may even have their national headquarters elsewhere,

22

but which in fact for all purposes related to venue are no

23

different from a domestic corporation, and let me try to

24

illuminate that by explaining what we're really talking

25

about in terms of factors related to venue.

MS. CHRISTIAN:. I think the practical answer to

that, Justice O'Connor, is that plaintiffs are going into

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL L. KLEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11
12

MR. KLEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Montana's venue laws, like those of virtually

13

every other jurisdiction in this country, treat residents

14

and nonresidents differently.

15

legitimacy of that basic distinction, but objects to one

16

aspect of its application -- Montana's decision to treat

17

its domestic corporations as residents while denying that

18

status to foreign corporations who simply have an office

19

in the State.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Petitioner acknowledges

How many States have laws like

Montana's, Mr. Klein?
MR. KLEIN:

Justice O'Connor, the answer is that

23

there are probably a dozen or so States that draw

24

distinctions similar.

25

different venue law, so for example, some States say --

The problem is, each State has a

1

and these are cited in petitioner's petition on pages 21

2

to 23, but some States will say that if you're a

3

nonresident you can be sued in the county of a plaintiff's

4

residence, so they're not identical, but I think there are

5

something like a dozen States that draw these kinds of

6

distinctions.

7

QUESTION:

Except for those dozen States, do the

8

other States generally require the foreign corporation to

9

designate a principal place of business within the State?

10

MR. KLEIN:

I don't think that's right, I think

11

there are a handful or so that do that.

12

don't use single place of business.

13

that's a key distinction between Saunders.

14

States provide that any corporation can be sued wherever

15

it has an office.

16

the statute in Saunders, and it seems to me, Justice

17

Kennedy, that's a very different statute.

18

Other States

In other words -- and
A lot of

Montana hasn't gone that way.

That was

If it says, look, wherever you have an office,

19

you're amenable to suit, now you're a foreign corporation,

20

and wherever you have an office it's not going to be a

21

limitation, that does seem to me to be an arbitrary

22

distinction.

23

But Montana has its own scheme, and I think it

24

rests on this rational justification, and that is, the

25

Montana legislature could rationally have concluded that

domestic corporations tend to have an important attribute

2

that foreign corporations like petitioners lack, and that

3

attribute is a single, easily identifiable headquarters in

4

the State of Montana.

5

That attribute, that single identifiable

6

headquarters, is rationally related to Montana's

7

distinction for two reasons:

8

headquarters relates to the kind of convenience

9

considerations that affect venue, and second of all,

first, having that

10

having such a headquarters means there won't be litigation

11

over where -the venue is located.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but I mean if it were discovered

13

that corporations -- just statistically it happens to be

14

true that corporations whose names begin in Z, many more

15

of those have such headquarters than corporations that

16

begin with other letters, you wouldn't allow a law that

17

said only those corporations whose names begin in Z can be

18

sued solely where their chief headquarters are.

20
21

MR. KLEIN:

That's because the preliminary

criteria is absolutely arbitrary.
QUESTION:

Well, that's right, but why isn't

22

it -- if -- why isn't it just as arbitrary to say well,

24

more likely to have a headquarters, why do you have to

QUESTION:

MR. KLEIN:

Well, let me see if I can develop

the distinction.

That is, the Montana legislature says

9

we're conferring venue based on residence because that is

10

convenient in the sense that the reason we have a

11

residence law is people want to be close to their

litigation.

13

Now, if you have your corporate* headquarters in

Montana, that's where your chief executive officials are

It's not simply that there's a correlation.

There's a reason to expect the correlation, Justice

Scalia, and that reason is, if you incorporate in Montana,

you're going to have your executive offices, as a rule,

there.

That's what the Montana legislature has decided.

That is not the case.

That is not

the case.

There was an earlier statute going back to

11

18 5, in which the option of designating a chief office

12

was available.

13

suggests a place where you could file suit, serve papers,

entitled to say we reside in this State.
And I would just follow that with a historical

12

point, Justice Scalia, is that this is an area where we're

13

talking about a tradition that goes back 100-some-odd

14

years in that as a logical matter if a State creates a

15

domestic corporation the logical inference is that it's

16

going to treat it as a residence.

17

That inference is still the rule, by the way,

18

under Federal venue statute 1400(b), that your residence

19

under 1400(b), as this Court made clear in Brunette, is

20

where you're incorporated, so I think this rule has both

Saunders said, but why isn't it reasonable to say look,

2

corporations are artificial entities -- they don't really

3

exist anywhere.

4

I mean, they don't have a residence, they're not

people, but if you're going to allow your domestic

thereby to be suable only in one place, you have to let

that an executive office where the people who ultimately

Is there anything to

The only thing to prevent you from

saying that is the language in the Montana supreme court

10

opinion that says it's the principal place of business and

11

that term has not been designated in the code.
In other words, until this year the term

12

13

principal place of business meant in Montana would it

14

customarily meant in corporate law, and in the case I

cite, what the court in Montana said in the Mapston case

is it said a school district is just like a corporation.

State.

This year you also designate your executive

offices as an office, but up until this year what you

would see on the form in Montana are the four chief

officials, which I think is in fact what the executive

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BETTY JO CHRISTIAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MS. CHRISTIAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

I have just two points.

First of all,

16

respondent has argued that the matter of convenience in

17

venue is entirely different for a foreign corporation and

18

for a domestic corporation on the theory that the

19

significant factor with respect to convenience in terms of

20

venue is where the chief executive officers and the

21

corporate records are, but I'd like to step back for a

22

moment and just look at what convenience in terms of venue

23

really means.

24

We're talking about convenience in the logistics

25

of a trial in a State district court, and what that really
43

SUITE 400

1

means is the convenience of having an office in which your

2

witnesses can remain and continue to get their work done

3

until shortly before they're called on the stand to

4

testify instead of having to leave town at least one day

5

ahead of time, go to another city, and stay in a hotel

6

waiting to be called.
It means having physical facilities, your

7
8

secretaries and word processors available, in order to put

9

together exhibits, in order to prepare witnesses for

10
11

trial.
This is the sort of thing, the sort of

12

convenience and economy, related to venue, not where the

13

chief executive officer is, who is highly unlikely to be

14

involved, and not the place where the corporate books and

15

records are kept.

16

QUESTION:

of case, really.

22

suspect the chief executive would not be involved in a

personal injury action.

If it were a merger case or, you know,

MS. CHRISTIAN:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, and our point is simply this, that in terms of

selecting --of identifying convenience generally, the

2

convenience in terms of State district court litigation

3

needs to focus primarily on the convenience of logistics

4

in running the trial, not upon in particular -- where

5

particular individuals would be.
QUESTION:

6

It's the logistics.

You say it has to.

You mean Montana

7

has no choice, it must focus on what you say it.must focus

8

on.

9

MS. CHRISTIAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, Montana has

10

complete discretion as to whether even to consider

11

convenience or not.

12

convenience is the key consideration, and I was simply

13

responding to their argument in terms of, if that is the

14

justification, then it applies just as much to a foreign

15

corporation that also has a place, one place from which it

16

would be more convenient to centralize its litigation, and

17

the mere fact it's incorporated elsewhere, or even has its

18

national headquarters elsewhere, does not mean it does not

19

have a single point that would be more convenient.

20

My final point is simply this:

Respondents have suggested that

the suggestion

21

has been made that the Saunders case was different from

22

this because in Saunders the venue for domestic

23

corporations was at any place where the corporation had a

24

fixed place of business -- pardon me, any place of

25

business, whereas for a foreign corporation it was any

1

county.

2

What this would mean in practice is that if you

3

have a relatively broad venue statute for a domestic

4

corporation so that the disparity with foreign is

5

relatively narrow, then it's a violation of the equal

6

protection clause, but if you have a vast disparity, the

7

difference between one county venue for the domestic

8

corporation and any county venue for the foreign

9

corporation, then.that passes constitutional muster, and

10

that simply does not square with any realistic notion of

11

equal protection.
If there are no further questions, thank you

very much.

QUESTION:

MS. CHRISTIAN:

Yes.

Did you consider arguing that this

MS. CHRISTIAN:

Traditionally, Justice Thomas,

19

this Court has considered venue laws, challenges to venue

20

laws, under the equal protection clause rather than the

21

commerce clause.

22

We think that there may be commerce clause

implications here, but from a policy standpoint, this is

the way this Court has treated it, and since it avoids a
