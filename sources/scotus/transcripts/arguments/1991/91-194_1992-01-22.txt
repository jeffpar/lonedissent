CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Gaggini, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E. GAGGINI

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GAGGINI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves North Dakota's refusal to

11

apply this Court's decision in Bellas Hess.

12

refusal, North Dakota is asking this Court first to

13

abrogate the historic standard for State taxation which

14

has resulted in an orderly growth of an open national

15

economy, and second, to ignore stare decisis and overrule

16

a construction of the commerce clause that is based on 50

17

years of case law.

18

By that

The irony of this case is that while the

19

European Community is eliminating locally erected tax

20

barriers in order to complete the creation of a European

21

Common Market, North Dakota and other States are

22

advocating a balkanization of the American market.

23

Overruling Bellas Hess will destroy the interstate

24

marketplace that we now know it.

25

Quill is a mail-order company.

That has hardly balkanized

the American market.
MR. GAGGINI:

12

No, the balkanization occurs

13

because North Dakota and other States are suggesting to

this Court that National Bellas Hess is no longer the

Is that on the assumption that

there's a due process component to Bellas Hess?
MR. GAGGINI:

10

Bellas Hess, Justice Kennedy,

11

involves two aspects, commerce and due process.

12

submit that this Court weighed those tests in 1967, when

13

Justice Stewart for the majority and Justice Fortas for

14

the dissenting, looked at the Illinois market.

Illinois market at that time was a target, a market that

National Bellas Hess was aiming at.

And this majority said that looking at prior

19

case law dating back to 1940, the Sears case, that this

20

Court has never imposed tax obligations on an out-of-State

21

vendor unless that vendor conducted in-State business

22

activity.

23

QUESTION:

Suppose we were to conclude that our

24

reading of Bellas Hess is that it's simply a commerce

25

clause case.

From that, then, we simply have an

MR. GAGGINI:

Justice Kennedy, I would submit

that under this Court's analysis in National Bellas Hess,

Complete Auto, National Geographic, and every case

6

preceding and succeeding, that there is both a commerce

and due process nexus question.

QUESTION:

National Bellas Hess

You're saying then that if we find

14

that there is no due process component, at least no viable

15

due process component, then we must overrule National

16

Bellas Hess.

17

MR. GAGGINI:

Your Honor, I'm suggesting that

18

the commerce clause and the due process component - - when

19

we speak of due process, there are two aspects.

20

the State's view of due process, which is personam

21

jurisdiction, and there is this Court's application of due

22

process in the tax area.

23

Both standards are different.

commerce clause aspect of this case in Complete Auto

2

that there be a substantial nexus in the taxing forum.
This Court has never held otherwise.

We can go

3

back to 1940 with Sears, Your Honor, and in the Sears

4

analysis, the Court specifically said that there was no

5

way to impose the obligation on the foreign business that

6

didn't have a presence.

7

8

held the first part -- the first component of the

9

four-part commerce test to require a substantial nexus.

11

on the theory that Bellas Hess must rest on a due process

12

analysis - -

13

MR. GAGGINI:

14

QUESTION:

I'm arguing - -

- - I suppose that that's your choice.

15

But it seems to me that our due process jurisprudence has

16

progressed to the point where it's very clear that your

17

clients could be held liable for products, liability, et

18

cetera, and that if Bellas Hess rested on due process at

19

one point -- if it did, and I'm not sure that it did --

20

that that has been superseded by our jurisprudence.

21

MR. GAGGINI:

22

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I --

If you want to say that Bellas Hess

23

then must be overruled, I suppose you're at liberty to

24

argue that.

I may have been misunderstood.

I

1

am suggesting to this Court that National Bellas Hess

2

relies on commerce clause concerns.

3

concerns require a finding of substantial nexus, a

4

physical presence, in the taxing forum.

5

consistently applied in every case this Court has decided.

6

From 1941 until this Court decided Goldberg, it required a

7

finding of substantial nexus for commerce clause.

8

that's what I am suggesting to Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

And commerce clause

That has been

And

Well, that's exactly the point, that

10

is we're forced to address here, whether that physical

11

presence requirement should exist anymore after Complete

12

Auto and the cases following it.

13

MR. GAGGINI:

14
15

Yes, Your Honor.

And may I

suggest that the State in this case -QUESTION:

I would have thought you might want

16

to rest your argument just on the commerce clause and say

17

it is better left to Congress to change.

18

surprised, as is Justice Kennedy, to hear your argument.

19

MR. GAGGINI:

I'm a little

Your Honor, again, I must be

20

misspeaking because I am suggesting to you that Bellas

21

Hess relies on the commerce.

22

underpinnings in that case, but we're saying based on the

23

commerce clause, North Dakota may not impose these tax

24

obligations on Quill because Quill has no physical

25

presence in North Dakota.

That's correct.

MR. SPAETH:

He mentioned one State, Maine, and

I want to

The State treated

it as a commerce clause case, we treated it as a commerce

they don't pay sales tax, is because either of a variety

As to one State, it's -- Your Honor, we cite in

methods of collecting this tax.

National Bellas Hess applies to the

company like Sears, because when Sears sells into local

they're not collecting.
