ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WALKER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
10

Robert Sawyer's mental disorders were

11

well-documented when he went on trial for his life in a

12

Louisiana courtroom.

13

had consistently been diagnosed with chronic brain damage

14

and mental retardation.

licking a postage stamp, but Sawyer's trial lawyer

neglected to do so.

damage and was mentally retarded.

Hospital records show that Sawyer

These records could have been

Sawyer presented this indisputably critical

21

evidence in a successive habeas corpus petition claiming

that his trial lawyer performed ineffectively under the

Sixth Amendment, but the Fifth Circuit --

ineffective assistance claim?
MR. WALKER:

2

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

Technically we're speaking here with a successive claim,

4

and that is to say the claim was presented in the initial

5

petition but was not supported with the hospital records

we refer to here today.

QUESTION:

2

MR. WALKER:

Well, do we know why they denied it?
Denied on the merits as a ruling of

the State trial judge and State supreme court in the

MR. WALKER:

There were some, but they were

No.

I would add, though, that even

in that proceeding the State supreme court denied review

generated.

They could have put in evidence at

investigated the case, and in fact there was an allegation

2

that although he knew Sawyer was in a mental hospital he

3

did not present the court with any evidence about that

4

commitment.

before the Federal district court the Federal district

court faulted -- I'm sorry, not the successive claim.

When the initial claim came before the Federal district

court, the district court adopted the opinion of the

magistrate, the magistrate faulted initial collateral

In effect, when the successive claim came

10

counsel for not demonstrating what the records would have

11

shown.

12

Now, when the successive claim was dismissed by

13

the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Fifth Circuit

14

fashioned a standard for reviewing successive claims which

15

forecloses any constitutional challenge to a death

16

sentence in a successive posture unless the constitutional

17

claim carries with it a challenge to all the aggravating

18

factors relied on by the jury.

19

QUESTION:

So you agree that you couldn't

20

satisfy the cause in prejudice.

22

We cannot demonstrate cause,

Justice White.

QUESTION:

MR. WALKER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WALKER:

Factual innocence.
That's correct.
Of the death penalty.
We submit that this Court's

5

fundamental miscarriage of justice doctrine will be

6

rendered meaningless if the Fifth Circuit's rigid and

7

inequitable eligibility test is upheld and Sawyer is

8

denied the opportunity to prove the claims in a successive

9

petition.

10

Before I turn to a discussion of the standard

11

developed by the Fifth Circuit and Sawyer's alternative

12

proposed standard, I'd like to spend a brief minute

13

discussing the two views of Robert Sawyer that emerge from

14

this record.

15

was presented to the jury in this case.

16

The first view, of course, is the view that

The picture of Robert Sawyer that the jury

17

considered was a picture of a person portrayed by

18

psychiatrists, and even his own lawyer, as a sociopath, a

19

person who has the ability to control his behavior but

20

freely chooses to engage in conduct harmful to others; a

21

person who beat up and ultimately set Fran Arwood on fire

22

because he likes to do those things; a person who had been

23

in a mental hospital one time, quote, for no reason.

24
25

A very different picture of Robert Sawyer
emerges from the evidence presented in support of the
8

1

successive habeas claim.

That picture of Robert Sawyer is

2

a picture of a person who has been committed twice in his

3

life to mental hospitals and in fact had been declared on

4

one occasion incapable of competing for employment in the

5

outside world.
For that Robert Sawyer the world is a very

6

7

confusing place, and when that Robert Sawyer arrived back

8

at his residence the day the homicide was committed, he

9

was confronted with a terribly confusing situation,

10

because after entrusting the care of his adopted children

11

to Fran Arwood, the babysitter, he thought one of them had

12

been drugged.

13

Now, Robert Sawyer's world is a very menacing

14

world, one where people are constantly out to get him.

15

normal person may not have thought that that child was

16

drugged, but Robert Sawyer thought that child was drugged,

17

because Robert Sawyer sometimes sees problems where they

18

don't exist because of his disabilities.

19

Robert Sawyer couldn't think this problem

20

through.

21

work that way.

22

exploded, his rage feeding on itself, and he beat and

23

brutalized Fran Arwood.

24
25

A

His mind doesn't work this way.

His mind won't

His mind became clouded with rage and he

Now, there is evidence in this record now -- and
I refer to the Brady claim -- that indicates that Sawyer

1

in fact did not participate in the burning of Fran Arwood.

2

That is the evidence in the successive petition, and

3

obviously it paints a very different picture of Robert

4

Sawyer's culpability and a picture which would be

5

presented and would have been presented if the case had

6

been litigated effectively by trial counsel.

7

One quick review of the medical evidence

8

presented in the successive petition.

We have records of

9

Sawyer's two commitments to mental institutions and

10

references to a third treatment at an outpatient clinic in

11

Tennessee:

12

diagnosis, chronic brain syndrome with unknown cause

13

manifested by mild mental retardation and abnormal EEG

14

with behavioral disturbances.

15

Hospital, similar diagnosis, incompetent.

16

City of Memphis Hospital's discharge

Recent evaluations in 1990 corroborate those

17

older historical diagnoses, same diagnoses -- mental

18

retardation, organic brain damage.

QUESTION:

Mr. Walker, you're not asserting that

your client was innocent by reason of insanity, are you?
MR. WALKER:

That's not an issue in this

litigation, because in part of Louisiana's rigid insanity

It's the McNaughton right-wrong test.

the murder must have been committed while the offender was

the crime for which he was convicted.
MR. WALKER:

I thought

you meant because of the mental state evidence.
QUESTION:

Did you make that claim before the

lower courts?
MR. WALKER:

The Brady claim was made before the

lower court.
QUESTION:

And that as a result he was guilty of

only second-degree murder?
MR. WALKER:

That's correct, and the Fifth

Circuit addressed that.

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question if I may,

22

Mr. Walker, on the same subject.

Let's say that in

Sawyer's first Federal habeas petition he brought an

24

ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the court

25

denied it because he'd failed to show prejudice, prejudice

first time?

What does he have to show in order for the

MR. WALKER:

Let me move to a discussion of our

standard, Chief Justice.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WALKER:

Under our proposal --

Can you answer my question?
Yes.

Under our proposal, first he

13

would have to show a factually inaccurate sentencing

14

profile and then, to respond directly to Your Honor, he

15

would have to show under either our proposal a fair

16

probability that the outcome would have been different --

17

that's drawn from Kuhlmann -- but we recognize that this

18

Court may feel it desirable to strengthen or rigidify that

19

standard, because it's admittedly --

20
21

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Isn't that just about the same thing

as the prejudice element of Strickland?
MR. WALKER:

It is, Your Honor, and that's why

we have also - QUESTION:

So really the actual innocence thing

really means almost nothing, if you take that view.

MR. WALKER:

1

I beg to differ.

Let me qualify

2

that.

3

except that under our standard one doesn't just look to

4

the burden of proof but to the nature of the claim, and in

5

this case the subset of Strickland errors that would be

6

cognizable under this exception would be a very small

7

subset, not the broad array of, he should have objected to

8

this testimony, he should have objected to that exclusion

9

of a death-qualified juror.

10

If you take that view, perhaps that's correct,

Our standard, Chief Justice, is the fair

11

probability standard, but we also endorse a much more

12

strict standard that was on the table in Strickland.

13

of the standards that was on the table in Strickland

14

before the Court in trying to divine what an appropriate

15

prejudice standard was in that context, was the strict --

16

as it was described, the strict outcome determinative

17

standard more probable than not.

Now, Johnson v. Singletary, the decision of the

19

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals which of course also

20

adopts the eligibility concept as a definition of death

21

innocence, we believe has a very persuasive dissenting

22

opinion joined, I think, by four justices.

23

Anderson, writing for the dissenters, said look, we got to

24

recognize here the State's interest in finality, but we

also have to recognize that some prisoners are entitled to

We believe a standard that is faithful to both of those

principles is the more probable than not standard, Chief

1

MR. WALKER:

We believe that there is a fair

2

probability that considering the Brady violation he would

3

not have been found guilty, but I'm addressing the Chief

4

Justice's concern with how we translate that

5

guilt-innocence exception into the penalty phase, and

6

we're suggesting that although our standard, the standard

7

that we advocate, is the Kuhlmann standard, that an

8

appropriate standard might indeed be the more probable

9

than not, the strict outcome determinative standard that

10

the dissenters in the Eleventh Circuit suggested was

11

appropriate.

12

QUESTION:

Why should it be translated into the

13

penalty phase at all?

14

we're making an exception for compelling circumstances to

15

our normal rules that you've had a fair trial and that's

16

the end of the matter, and we've said, you know, why isn't

17

it reasonable to say well, if in fact you weren't guilty

18

of the crime, that's an extraordinary circumstance, but

19

you're saying even if you are guilty of the crime you

20

might have gotten a lesser sentence.

21

extraordinary a circumstance at all.

MR. WALKER:

I mean, why -- I had thought that

I don't find that as

Well, Justice Scalia, just as we

23

have a right to have a fair trial under this Court's

24

jurisprudence there was an equally strong right to a fair

sentencing hearing.

Well, that's certainly not our

jurisprudence in most areas.

argument if he got 50 years instead of 10 years, would

4

you?

5

MR. WALKER:

You wouldn't be making this

No, we wouldn't, because we're

6

talking now about a fundamentally different sort of

7

proceeding, and we're talking about a proceeding where the

8

stakes are not whether he goes to prison or not, or the

9

degree or length of a period of incarceration, we're

10

talking about whether or not a person will live or die,

11

and this Court has noted in its jurisprudence since Gregg

12

itself that death is a qualitatively different kind of

13

punishment than any other punishment that can be doled out

14

by a sentencing judge in the United States of America.

15

And again I think that if we reference the facts

16

of this case, all reasonable people would agree that it's

17

fundamentally unfair that Robert Sawyer has not at least

18

had a chance to put before some tribunal his severe and

19

crippling mental disabilities and have a tribunal at least

20

evaluate whether or not if that evidence had been

21

presented the jury may have voted for a life sentence.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I agree that death is different

23

from other punishments, but so is punishment different

24

from -- so is the nature of the punishment different from

only held that if you are innocent can you have a second

2

trial, and you're urging us to carry that over into a

3

whole new area where you are not innocent, but you say I

4

should not have gotten as severe a penalty as I did.

5

Even if I acknowledge that death is a different

6

penalty, I don't know why that compels me to say that this

particular doctrine should be extended from innocence over

8

to penalty.

11

MR. WALKER:

Well, my reading of Smith, Justice

Scalia, is that that's a settled question.
QUESTION:

I don't agree with you on that.

It

12

seems to me there is language in Smith and language - -

13

that is fairly ambiguous.

14

settled the other way, but I for one don't regard it as

15

settled, contrary to Justice Scalia's view.

MR. WALKER:

You certainly can't say it's

Well, I might say that this Court

17

in its guilt phase miscarriage cases has indicated that

MR. WALKER:

No, the standard is not the same.

12

The standard is not the same under either our proposal or

13

the proposal which we also endorse out of the Eleventh

14

Circuit, and fundamentally more important again, it's the

15

petitioner's burden and not the burden of the State to

16

show that the error had no effect.

17

Perhaps I might briefly discuss this Court's

18

Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, because hopefully, Justice

19

Scalia, it will answer your concern.

20

construction of death innocence eligibility is a

21

fundamentally flawed concept, because it collides with the

22

Eighth Amendment's core concern of individualized

23

sentencing.

24

that anyone who is a member of a legislatively defined

25

death eligible class is deserving of punishment and that

We believe that as a

Implicit in the concept of eligibility is

1

therefore no fundamental injustice can occur by executing

2

anyone within that class, deserving not only of punishment

3

but deserving of the death penalty.

4

Now, of course this validates the Eighth

5

Amendment's narrowing function, the Furman half, but it is

6

utterly unfaithful to the Eighth Amendment's core

7

consideration of individualized sentencing.

8

In our view, the problem with eligibility is a
problem with the mandatory death penalty statutes this

10

Court struck down 15 years ago.

This Court struck those

11

statutes down because they negated the individual worth of

12

a human being.

13

the principle that emerged from those holdings is that a

14

capital defendant must be treated as an individual, and of

15

course that is recognized --

16

QUESTION:

This Court struck those statutes down, and

It violates that, but the question

17

isn't whether you're entitled to individualized

18

sentencing, the question is whether you're entitled to two

1

swings at it.

20

violation of law in the first trial, the question isn't

21

whether you are entitled to whatever that violation of law

22

denied you -- of course you are by definition -- but the

23

question we're speaking to today is whether, having

24

through your own fault not made that assertion at the

25

first trial, you're entitled to have a second trial, and

I'm saying

that we do it when the death penalty has been imposed.

I'm saying that there should be -- and admittedly it will

9

be a very, very rare, small universe of cases, but that

10

there is that universe of cases where a jury was so

11

radically misinformed, like in this case, as to the

12

petitioner's individual culpability, that it would be a

13

fundamental miscarriage of justice not to allow a

14

petitioner to litigate the merits of a claim that

addresses that issue, even though --

MS. PENDERGAST:

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The State of Louisiana endorses the Fifth

Circuit's definition of actual innocence of the death

penalty and urges this Court to adopt that definition at

22

the very least.

23

Since Louisiana narrows --

QUESTION:

When you say at the very least,

24

Ms. Pendergast, I think the Solicitor General here has

perhaps taken a narrower position than the Fifth Circuit.

1

Do you agree with that position as an alternative?
MS. PENDERGAST:

2

I do agree with it, because

3

Louisiana narrows the class of persons eligible for the

4

death penalty at the definitional stage, so it really

5

is -- the Solicitor General's definition is a workable and

6

acceptable definition to the State of Louisiana, and I

7

propose to defend the Fifth Circuit's definition and allow

8

Mr. Larkin to defend the Solicitor General's definition.

9

This Court has said that actual innocence does

10

not translate easily into the penalty phase of a capital

11

trial, and in reality the Eighth and Ninth Circuit's

12

definition and Mr. Sawyer's proposed definition do not

13

translate at all into the penalty phase of a capital

trial, because their definitions concentrate on

discretionary factors.

QUESTION:

Your view of the State's obligation

is just to prove the elements of the crime.

MS. PENDERGAST:

In the guilt phase, and then

when we come to the penalty phase we have certain

objective factors which are aggravating factors.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, I know, but when does one in

Louisiana become eligible for the death penalty?

10

MS. PENDERGAST:

11

QUESTION:

Actually, you are tried --

When you're proven guilty of a

MS. PENDERGAST:

QUESTION:

Before there's eligibility for the

death sentence?

MS. PENDERGAST:

But that's built into the

definition of first degree murder, the aggravating

circumstance.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. PENDERGAST:

9

I see.

All right.
And then when you go to the

penalty phase the jury is told that they have to find at

10

least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable

doubt and then they are to consider the mitigating

12

circumstances to determine whether death is the

13

appropriate sentence.
QUESTION:

14

But they're eligible for the --

15

eligible for the death penalty before you ever get to the

16

sentencing stage.

17
18

MS. PENDERGAST:

Yes, by the definitional stage,

actually.

19

The State of Louisiana clearly supports the

20

Fifth Circuit view because the Fifth Circuit is concerned

21

with the eligibility which are at the death penalty phase,

22

and those are objective standards to which we can measure

23

something.

24

the standard is unclear and it does not go to any

objective factors which can be measured.

this is clearly supported by Dugger v. Adams where this

procedural default, and a Caldwell error goes to the

accuracy of the sentencing determination.

Also, a definition as Sawyer proposes would play

havoc with Sawyer v. Smith, which said that a Caldwell

to look to the fact that Sawyer's definition, he tries to

His miscarriage of justice standard includes
only those errors where the jury heard false evidence or
were precluded from hearing true mitigating facts.

His

10

standard overrules McCleskey insofar as McCleskey set the

11

standard for a miscarriage of justice by saying that a

12

miscarriage of justice is not promoted by just mere error,

13

not mere constitutional error, and not mere prejudicial

14

constitutional error, but prejudicial, constitutional

15

error that goes to guilt or innocence.

16

And when we translate that into the penalty

phase, it can only be done with any kind of reasoning if

18

we adopt a test like the Fifth Circuit that goes to the

eligibility of the defendant for the death penalty which

implicates only objective factors.

concerns of finality, of State court convictions because

I think it's important to remember that what

1

2

we're talking about is that this is a second Federal

3

habeas petition, that the standard of review should be

4

more strict than on the first Federal habeas petition, and

5

that actual innocence should be limited to only those

6

extraordinary cases where the defendant would be actually

7

innocent or not eligible to have the death penalty

8

imposed.

And I think it's important to remember that we

are talking about a sentencing hearing where there's no
10

correct outcome, and that this is a discretionary area and

11

we cannot allow a Federal court to reweigh mitigating

12

evidence and substitute its judgment and its reweighing

13

for the State sentencer or the State -- the highest court

14

in a State.

15

between State and Federal courts.

16

This violates the core concerns of comity

Sawyer mistakenly has claimed that the State

17

must prove that death is the appropriate penalty in his

18

brief, and I want to remind -- point out to this Court

1

that Louisiana does not require the State to prove that

20

death is an appropriate penalty, that Louisiana only

21

requires after a conviction of first degree murder that

22

the State prove an aggravating circumstance beyond a

23

reasonable doubt, and then the jury is charged to consider

24

the mitigating evidence, or mitigating circumstances, and

25

to determine whether death is appropriate.

aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.

Louisiana is not a weighing State, and additional facts in

mitigation would not be a substantial consequence for the

I would like first to answer Justice Stevens'

question.

Your Honor asked whether the more likely than

cause and prejudice test, and in our view the answer is

14

yes.

That's our understanding of it.

15

At page 14 of our amicus brief, we cite and

16

excerpt some of the relevant portions of this Court's

17

discussion in Frady which was later reiterated again in

18

Carrier, and what the Court said there was, in order to

19

show prejudice you have to show not merely the possibility

20

of an error, but that something worked to the actual and

21

substantial disadvantage of the defendant, and as we've

22

read that, it seems to indicate that the defendant has to

23

show it's more likely than not that he was prejudiced by

24

it.

something could be to the actual and substantial

disadvantage of a defendant without it also necessarily-

3

being true that the verdict would more likely than not

MR. LARKIN:

That could, but then you also have

6

to keep in mind the other part of the court's discussion

7

in these cases, which is the cause and prejudice test is

8

stricter than the plain error test.

9

plain error that doesn't prejudice the jury's verdict, but

Now, you could have a

10

it seems to us that if you're having something stronger

11

than the plain error test in the prejudice component, in

12

light of also the discussion of the way you've described

13

it in cases of Frady and Carrier, we've always thought

14

that it really requires a more-likely-than-not showing by

15

someone.

More likely than not of a substantial

disadvantage, or more likely than not that the result

would have been different?

MR. LARKIN:

The latter, Your Honor -- more

likely than not that the result would have been different.

that analysis when the challenge is to something in the

2

For example, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits made no effort

in their opinions in the cases we've cited in our brief to

reconcile how they described the actual innocence doctrine

with the way this Court has described the actual prejudice

approach has virtually conceded that point.

right, and we think this Court's decision in Dugger v.

Whether there's a balancing

Absolutely, which is in a case like

Our position is very simple.

If a defendant

constitutionally may be imposed, he is not actually

11

innocent of that sentence.

12

before it findings that are adequate under this Court's

13

decision in Tison to allow the death penalty to be

14

imposed, the defendant is not actually innocent of the

15

death penalty, and that approach is one that can be

applied by district courts across the board in Georgia, in

Louisiana, or in Mississippi.

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter.

Basically it removes the distinction

between capital and noncapital cases.
MR. LARKIN:

It does it by making sure that what

21

you have is a proportionality test.

In a noncapital case

22

if a defendant were convicted of a crime for which the

23

type of sentence he's challenging could not be imposed

24

under this Court's decision in Harmolin, then he can bring

that type of actual innocence claim.

2

obliterating that distinction.
We don't think that's inconsistent with the way

3

this Court has approached it, because after all in Smith

4

and Murray the Court said it refused to adopt special

5

cause and prejudice rules simply because there was a

6

capital case at issue.

here is a system that will adequately work and solve the

problems that some people from the bench have mentioned of

how to dispose of these cases on the day an execution is

scheduled to go forward.

Well, you say if the Court has before

it findings that the defendant was guilty of a capital

13

eligible offense.

14

Do you mean by that a jury verdict?

MR. LARKIN:

If the jury verdict is going to

example, is going to be the capital crime.

MR. LARKIN:

Well, if he can show he didn't do

it, then he's actually innocent of the crime, not just the

My earlier comment,

everyone, I think, universally agrees, and in that sense,

Now, as we said, we think there are several

1

2

principals that support this.

3

clear in Gregg, in Tison, in McCLeskey, one, that the

4

death penalty can be imposed for the crime of intentional

5

homicide.

6

aggravating factors serve a valuable function at

7

sentencing but they do not define the elements of capital

8

murder.

9

First, the Court has made

Second, the Court has made clear that

Third, the Court has made clear in a case

10

involving this very State's capital sentencing laws,

11

Lowenfield v. Phelps, that whatever essential predicates

12

are necessary under Tison or the other cases for the

13

imposition of the death penalty to be lawful, those

14

predicates can be established at the guilt stage, they

15

don't need to be established at sentencing.

16

Finally, we think that given the fact that at

17

this stage the State's judgment should not only be

18

presumed to be correct, but given the fact that Federal

19

habeas has once gone through and completed without finding

20

any material errors that the presumption should be

21

virtually irrebuttable at this point, we think it's

22

appropriate to focus on the question whether the prisoner

23

has committed an offense for which the death penalty can

24

be imposed.

25

After all, aggravating factors are that -- they

aggravate the crime.

If the crime of murder can be

2

punished by death, and this Court has repeatedly held that

3

it can be, we think at this stage of the case it is

4

unnecessary to expand the limited actual innocence

5

exception to take into account these other types of

6

factors.

7

Unless the Court - -

8

QUESTION:

9

I don't know why it has to be

extended to take into account the penalty phase at all.
MR. LARKIN:

10

Well, it could, Your Honor.

That

11

would even be a narrower position than we had urged.

12

could just drop it out, and that's consistent with every

13

holding in this Court.

14

You

Smith and Murray and McCleskey and Dugger never

15

granted relief on this exception, and so there is no

16

holding of this Court that would apply the actual

17

innocence exception to a sentence at all, but we haven't

18

MR. LARKIN:

Your Honor, you could in essence

flip around what happens at trial.

There there's a

presumption of innocence and the State has to prove beyond

4

a reasonable doubt that the defendant did it.

stage, put the presumption on the prisoner and require him

to show that he didn't do it.

Now, you could require it by a preponderance, by

clear and convincing which is close to beyond a reasonable

wouldn't be an irrational way to proceed.

endorse is located on page 3 of our reply brief in Note 1,

and also the amicus brief filed on our behalf by the Legal

page 40.
Secondly, this jury heard no evidence whatsoever

about Sawyer's mental retardation, or even his low

intelligence, and certainly heard nothing about organic

brain damage.
Third, I believe that we've heard here a

in short, the error neither precluded the development of
