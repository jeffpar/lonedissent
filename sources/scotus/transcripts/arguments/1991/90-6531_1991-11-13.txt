ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALVIN J. BRONSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BRONSTEIN:

11
12

The Court remains in session.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I represent, by appointment of this Court, the

13
14

petitioner, Keith Hudson, a prisoner at the Louisiana

15

State Penitentiary at Angola, Louisiana.

16

On the night of October 30, 1983, Mr. Hudson had

17

an exchange of words with one of the respondents, Sergeant

18

McMillian.

disciplinary charge, two charges I believe, and to comport

20

with the policy, McMillian then called another officer,

21

the respondent Sergeant Woods and again, by virtue of

22

policy, called their ranking superior, Lieutenant Mezo.

23

The officers placed Hudson in full restraints

The officer decided to give Hudson a

25

to in the record as the dungeon.

Graham v. Connor.

QUESTION:

Do you object just to the first part

4

of the Fifth Circuit's four-part test, the significant

5

injury part?

6

appropriate under Whitley?

7

Do you think the other factors are

MR. BRONSTEIN:

rather confusing.

12

They seem to be interrelated.

QUESTION:

One must

What case do you think provides the

Is it Whitley or some other case?

MR. BRONSTEIN:

I don't think we need to reach

13

that, Justice O'Connor, in this case because whatever the

14

standard is —

15

QUESTION:

Well, would you answer me, please,

16

what case do you think provides the proper standard for a

17

case of this kind?

18

MR. BRONSTEIN:

I think in this case where there

19

was no penalogical justification for the behavior of the

20

officers, where there was no emergency, where there was no

21

tense situation, there was no need to make split-second

22

decisions, the test ought to be deliberate indifference:

23

that is, the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.

24
25

QUESTION:

I would have thought that probably

Whitley provided the standard in asking whether the force

1

was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore

2

discipline, or whether it was done maliciously or

3

sadistically for the purpose of causing harm.

4

MR. BRONSTEIN:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Whitley —

I would think that would fit, would

it not?
MR. BRONSTEIN:

It does fit, but I don't think

8

it is a necessary standard in this case under these facts.

9

Whitley is a situation where you had a major disturbance.

10

You still had a hostage.

11

milling around.

12

he saw the prisoner running up the stairs —

13

You had officers and prisoners

The officer had to make a decision when

QUESTION:

It sounds to me like you would think

14

that we have to apply the standard for perhaps failure to

15

provide medical care?

16

MR. BRONSTEIN:

17

QUESTION:

It's similar.

But in that context we have said that

18

significant harm has to ensue.

19

that that's the standard you propose.

MR. BRONSTEIN:

I'm a little surprised

Well, I don't recall seeing

significant harm in Estelle, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

I thought we had said that in the

23

Estelle prison conditions format that there has to be a

24

showing of prolonged and significant discomfort.

25

MR. BRONSTEIN:

That was one of the things that

1

had to be shown.

There had to be the unnecessary -- the

2

objective element was some unnecessary and wanton

3

infliction of pain.

4

actual injury, without harm.

5

In this case, if instead of administering the beating,

6

they had hooked up the prisoner to the tucker telephone

7

that's described in a number of this Court's opinions,

8

there would have a been a great deal of pain, or some

Pain — you can have pain without

/

9

pain, but no injury.
So I think the test is closer to Estelle under

10
11

these facts that it is to Whitley.

12

in the beginning, we don't need to reach that in this case

13

because whatever the test is, it's met.

Court.

What the court

The Court has never focused on significant

injury in Eight Amendment cases, but rather on the

unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.

I guess you at least have to have

that it was the policy of the prison to punish people this

way?

No, on the contrary.

1

MR. BRONSTEIN:

2

QUESTION:

Well

The reason I am asking is, I mean,

3

assuming we agree with you on the, you know, extent of the

4

injury point, I just wonder whether we should remand for

5

some further findings by the district court.

6

particularly referring to what we said in Wilson v.

7

Seiter, that deprivation does not constitute punishment if

8

prison officials — neither knew or had reason to know

9

about it.

10

I mean, I am

I think we might by officials something more

than a prison guard.
MR. BRONSTEIN:

11

Respectfully, I disagree.

I

12

think if you look at all other cases we talk about guards

13

as being officials.

14

this, a prison guard, and these were sergeants and one

15

lieutenant, they administer on behalf of the State an

16

enormous amount of authority and power.

17

and authority over the prisoner, the prisoner's life and

18

every moment of that day.

In the context of a facility like

They have power

They called their superior officer; he is

19
20

referred to in the record as "rank."

That's the

21

expression they used.

So clearly a lieutenant is a very

senior officer there.

But we have no derivative liability

I

22

i

23

claim here.

We don't have an issue of whether the State

24

is liable.

We have no issue of whether superior officers

25

are liable because of the actions of the lower officials.

1

That's not involved in this case.
He sued only the respondents individually.

2

They

3

were given a certain amount of authority and power by the

4

State.

5

so I don't see any problem about policy being involved in

6

this case.

7

There is no color of State law issue in this case,

Indeed, the official policy would be that you

8

don't beat up prisoners.

9

these guards did beat up a prisoner.

But as it apparently happened,
They are liable

%

10

because they beat him up, because the State gave him --

11

gave them the authority or the power to do it.

12

They were wearing the uniforms.

They had the

13

power to put this person — they were engaged in, in the

14

language that you yourself used, Justice Scalia, in West,

15

where you were concerned about -- West v. Atkins -- you

16

were concerned about the doctor, the private physician,

17

who didn't have any supervisory role, nor did he have any

18

penalogical role, although the majority of the Court

19

disagreed with you -- your characterization of that.

20

But here these officers did have penalogical

21

roles; that's what they do.

They discipline prisoners,

22

and they remove prisoners.

23

That is accepted practice, to put people in restraints at

24

a maximum security unit before you move them.

25

they beat him on their way to discharging their other

Would a pre­

Well, I suppose your client could

too.
MR. BRONSTEIN:

10

Theoretically he could, but this

11

Court on a number of occasions has said that the

12

substantive due process right of a sentenced prisoner is

13

redundant, that the Eighth Amendment is the one we must

14

look to.

15
16

QUESTION:

it is just as obvious as can be that this is punishment —

Webster.

That's right.

That would meet

I didn't mean to interrupt, Justice White.

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

MR. BRONSTEIN:

Webster says to punish is to

21

cause to undergo pain, loss, or suffering.

22

caused him pain and suffering in this case, and they did

23

it in the Eighth Amendment context because they were

wearing uniforms and they were engaged in, at least in

25

part, what they are supposed to do.

Well, they

QUESTION:

And he was in prison.

What would be the leading case from

In Bell v. Wolfish, there is

some discussion of that, the pre-trial equivalent of

QUESTION:

What about the school spanking case,

19

where the Court drew the line between convictions and

20

punishment, pre-conviction punishment.

21

1

That's the closest case on

2

substantive due process?

3

MR. BRONSTEIN:

I think so, but again, this

Court keeps making it clear that Eighth Amendment is the

5

appropriate standard when you are talking about a

sentenced prisoner --

QUESTION:

Mr. Bronstein, with apologies to Mr.

8

Webster, that definition you read, it says to cause --

9

what was it again?

10
11

To cause —

MR. BRONSTEIN:

Undergo pain, loss, or

suffering.
QUESTION:

12

Well, I mean, when I accidentally hit

13

somebody with my car, I cause that effect, and I — you

know, I would not say that I punished that person.

15

would say I hurt the person.

MR. BRONSTEIN:

Yes.

MR. ROBERTS:

3

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may be it please the Court:

4

The Federal Government runs the second largest

5

prison system in this country, second only to

6

California's.

7

aware of the problem of frivolous brutality suits filed by

8

inmates — inmates who have nothing but time on their

9

hands and for whom a trip to the courthouse for a hearing

That responsibility has made us keenly

%

10

would be a pleasant diversion.

11

Accordingly, we would welcome any development

12

that holds promise of weeding out such frivolous suits.

13

Like every other circuit to have considered the question,

14

however, we cannot embrace the Fifth Circuit's significant

15

injury test.
That test is an extra-constitutional construct

16
17

with no basis in the text or history of the Eighth

Amendment or in this Court's decisions interpreting it.

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

This action was taken in response

4

to a prison disturbance and therefore the principles of

Whitley would apply.

6

that there was no justification for the force that was

7

applied is the answer to the question that Whitley asks

8

and can't be used to prove the inapplicability of the

9

think in that case it may not properly be characterized as

The question was, did the Fifth Circuit apply

the correct legal test when determining the petitioner's

claim that his Eighth Amendment rights under the cruel and

unusual punishment clause were not violated as a result of

a single incident of force by the respondents, which did

not cause a significant injury.

think the only one with which we are concerned with today

is the first element, namely that is, that there must be a

Now, what my friends appear to have done is that

they seem to be overlooking that or merging it, insofar as

the decisions of this honorable Court are concerned, with

unnecessary and wanton suffering.

was also beaten, as to which we have no evidence and
nothing but the passing remark by the magistrate.
But let me come back, if I may, to your original
question.

Is there any objection to the administration of

some sort of treatment or some — something that gives a
great deal of pain but doesn't leave a trace?

No.

Because what we say is that you have a different standard,
if you will, where the violation consists of a physical
beating, which would normally leave traces, or one which
was calculated not to leave traces, because we all know,
to the shame of ou system, that there are methods of
torturing or punishing people that leave no traces.
As to those, if the testimony is that there was
intense suffering, say, but that the nature of the
procedure was such that it left no marks, then we do not
urge this test of a — an observable significant injury.
What we're saying is, and we would respectfully enjoin the
Court to bear this in mind.

We are saying that where

there is a physical invasion, if you will, a physical
maltreatment of a prisoner which would normally be
expected to leave some sort of traces, that then there
must have been a significant injury.
Now, that doesn't exclude a significant injury
that doesn't leave traces.

For example, in your Estelle

case, there was no physical trace, but what they said was

that studied indifference to serious medical needs could

2

lead to a condition which would be sufficiently

3

detrimental, if you will, sufficiently harmful to the

4

prisoner to warrant invoking the Eighth Amendment.
By the same token, in the conditions of

deterioration on the part of the prisoners, but the test

MR. McCALL:

If I recall Whitley, Your Honor,

3

the Court -- Your Honors held that there was the --

4

clearly the -- more than significant injury and they held

5

that that injury however did not constitute a

6

constitutional deprivation because of the absence of the

7

subjective element.

So that I don't think you can go off entirely on
the physical — on the objective, or entirely on the

subjective.

subjective.

13

And this, as I recall, was the lesson of

Now, clearly, in Whitley you had — you

satisfied the objective test, but the subjective test was

15

not satisfied.

16

there may have been satisfaction of the subjective test,

17

but the objective test was not satisfied.

18

for that was that the injuries were so slight.

Now, what we say here is that perhaps

And the reason

Now as I say, coming back again to your

they want to alter his conduct in some way?

14

MR. McCALL: I really don't know.

15

whether it was just that they were annoyed with him

16

because they felt that they had -- he had given them lip,

17

so to speak, and they were just going to show him or

18

whether they hoped that this would have a salutary effect

19

on future conduct.

20

QUESTION:

I don't know

That — I can't answer that —
Well, of course, I suppose if they

21

intended to discipline him or affect his conduct some way

22

or deter a repetition of his conduct, they would want to

23

make sure that they did something to him besides inflict a

24

frivolous injury -- I mean,N just a de minimis thing.

wouldn't affect anybody.

QUESTION:

Yes what?

MR. McCALL:

Yes, that there is an Eighth

Amendment violation because you have -- once you establish

a causation factor, whether it was intended that he should

fall or whether the fall was the result of what they

intended to do, that comes back to the basic --

Don't you suppose they intended to beat him?

I'm sure they did.

MR. McCALL:

say, saying, we are going to beat him, we are going to

happened unless there had been strong feelings, and

whether those were motivated by a desire to shall I say

No, I don't say that, although it

MR. McCALL:

I thought you already had said that?
Because —
You're getting to a significant

as to your question is, no.

no is that that would not constitute an action by the

I say there are two separate questions.

One is, did this

Now, while to you or to me or to anyone in our

situation in life, even a slight beating would constitute

21

a significant injury, the fact is that in context, this

22

was not a significant injury and the standard which this

Court has enunciated in those cases, and in particular in

24

Wilson against Seiter, that you must suffer objectively

v. Seiter lawyer's edition opinion.

3

Whitley was cited for the proposition that, assuming that

the conduct is harmful enough to satisfy the objective

component of an Eight Amendment claim.

6

Rhodes is cited for the proposition that the objective

7

component of the Eighth Amendment prison claim was, and I

quote:

Again, at page 282,

And at page 279,

"Was the deprivation sufficiently serious?"
So that what we would respectfully suggest to

Your Honors is that the test applied by the Fifth Circuit,

element, was there a significant injury, is a proper one.

It is one which is in keeping with the holdings of this

Court.

15

means of eliminating frivolous claims, and that,

therefore, we would strongly recommend to Your Honors that
