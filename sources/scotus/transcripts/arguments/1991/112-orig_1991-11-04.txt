ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL LEADER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. LEADER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it

please the Court:
You are asked today, I believe, to establish a

11

12

dangerous precedent, not a dangerous precedent in the area

13

of Commerce Clause law, but a dangerous precedent in the

14

area of your original jurisdiction, for today in this

15

original action, Wyoming makes a Commerce Clause challenge

16

to an Oklahoma law that requires coal-burning utilities in

17

Oklahoma who sell to Oklahoma consumers to burn at least

18

10 percent coal.

19

This challenge is brought, however, on the basis

20

of an indirect taxing interest, an interest in collecting

21

coal severance tax. The essence of Wyoming's claim is that

22

Oklahoma's law results in the private Wyoming coal

23

producers having a smaller share of Oklahoma's coal

24

market.

25

This reduction in market share, Wyoming argues,

and I will argue later, but it does not prove, reduces

2

Wyoming coal production, which in turn lowers severance

3

tax.

4

Oklahoma's position is that the exercise of

5

original jurisdiction to adjudicate a Commerce Clause

6

challenge based on an alleged indirect loss of tax revenue

7

is (1) inappropriate,

8

likely popularize a new trend which I will refer to as

9

end-running, and I will discuss that new trend in a

10

(2) not necessary, and it will very

moment.
As this Court has recognized, the exercise of

11
12

original jurisdiction by this Court is a serious intrusion

13

on society's interest in the Court's most deliberate and

14

considerate performance of its paramount role as a supreme

15

Federal appellate court, and original jurisdiction should

16

only be assumed when justified by the strictest necessity.

17

To permit a State to maintain a Commerce Clause

18

challenge to protect an indirect tax interest is not

19

strictly necessary and not appropriate because it invites

20

mischief.

21

end-running, where someone who is engaged in commerce and

22

the commerce is taxed and they want to challenge another

23

State's statute, but they don't want to have to come up

24

through the district court and the appeals system,

25

end-runs the traditional system by going to the Government

It invites a new game, a game called

and say, you taxed this, you bring an original action.
And then we wind up with an appearance of State
qua State saying, we are interested in our taxes -QUESTION:

You suggest that the taxpayer is

5

going to invite the State to impose the tax just so it can

6

run this end run?

7

MR. LEADER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LEADER:

I am not, but - That's what I thought you said.
--we are dealing with commerce,

10

Your Honor, and almost everything that moves in commerce

11

is at one place taxed, one place or another taxed by the

12

State, and that is why it is so dangerous in this

13

particular area.

14

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting the State doesn't

15

care that it loses tax revenue?

16

MR. LEADER:

I am saying the State certainly

17

does care, but I am stating it is not necessary for the

18

State to come here to get relief, and therefore, original

19

jurisdiction shouldn't allow.

20

Secondly, I am saying that the danger is that we

21

have the appearance of State qua State, but we really have

22

a State qua shill for the local industry.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Leader, what would be the

24

perceived advantages from the point of view of the

25

Commerce Clause plaintiff in going for original

1

jurisdiction rather than in coming up through either the

2

State or Federal court system?

3

MR. LEADER:

Having a final answer for the

4

entire country, that -- don't have to worry about being

5

overturned so simply another time.

6

is proceeded as speedier, if you get here, and can start

7

here, you become the Court or the forum of first choice.

8

It saves time and money because you don't have all those

9

layers of litigation.

10
11

12

Secondly, I assume it

So there are several advantages here that would
invite the danger.
QUESTION:

I don't understand how we come

13

off -- you mean whenever a State has a valid interest and

14

a sufficient interest to confer standing, article 3

15

standing, we should still and all inquire case by case

16

whether somehow that interest is what?

17

to justify the risk of end-running that you refer to?

18

Significant enough

I mean, I can understand an argument that there

19

is no State interest here or not the sufficiently direct

20

interest that would confer standing, but that is not the

21

argument you are making.

22

23

MR. LEADER:

That will be my second argument,

Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LEADER:

I see.
My first argument is, because of

1

the dangers involved here, and because of the other forums

2

that are available, the strictest necessity test simply is

3

not met in this kind of case»

4

QUESTION:

May I just suggest this with respect

5

to these dangers, the parade of horrors, let me say

6

something, we are in a pretty good position to control

7

those dangers.

8

awful lot of these complaints being filed, we do not have

9

to take the -- allow the complaints to be filed.
MR. LEADER:

10
11

QUESTION:

MR. LEADER:

Even that takes time and other

people get to - QUESTION:

.16
17

Well, we would just deny a leave to

file the bill of complaint.

14
15

You may control them, but still

your docket gets clogged up.

12

13

In other words, if we think there are an

Well, that doesn't take an awful lot

of time.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. LEADER:

The use of original jurisdiction is

20

not necessary here because first, the real party's

21

interests, the Wyoming coal producers, have both Federal

22

and State courts available to them, and truly, if this

23

indirect tax interest is enough to justify the cost of

24

litigation, the direct impact would motivate the actual

25

movers in commerce similarly.

1

Secondly, the State could have sued the State

2

utility companies here in either State or Federal court

3

and sought injunctive relief and declaratory judgment.

4

The State is also not prohibited from

5

encouraging the people who are actually affected from

6

bringing suit.

7

the movers in commerce from bringing the action, or given

8

the proper appropriation, not prohibited from funding it.

The State is not prohibited from helping

9

In short, there are sufficient alternatives to

10

have this issue resolved, and the strict necessity which

11

you say is, was to guard your original jurisdiction has

12

not been met here.

13

We say the special master erred in finding that

14

this was an appropriate case for original jurisdiction.

15

Secondly, we say that the special master erred in finding

16

that this indirect tax interest conferred sufficient

17

standing.

18

There is no Supreme Court case that we have been

19

able to find that recognizes this indirect taxing interest

20

as justifying standing.

21

the teachings of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case in

22

Philadelphia v. Kleppe.

23

We would urge the Court to follow

In that case the State of Pennsylvania sued the

24

Small Business Administration, challenging that agency's

25

classification of a hurricane-damaged area as a Class B

1

disaster.

Pennsylvania claimed that its taxing revenue

2

and economy were damaged by the mistake in classification.

3

The court of appeals rejected this vicarious

4

injury as the basis of standing, saying, impairment of

5

State tax revenue should not, in general, be recognized as

6

sufficient injury in fact to support State standing.

7

And the court goes on and says, we need a direct

8

link between the State statute and the collection of

9

taxes, and then says, this would prevent State standing in

10

cases like the present one where the diminution of tax

11

receipts is largely an incidental result of the challenged

12

activity.

13

Now, even if on occasion this indirect taxing

14

collection interest could justify standing, that interest

15

has not been shown here.

16

Power Company v. California Environmental Study Group, to

17

show standing a plaintiff must (1) show direct and

18

palpable injury to the plaintiff, and a fairly traceable

19

causal connection between the claimed injury and the

20

challenged conduct.
Here, Wyoming has failed to prove those

elements.

And certainly -QUESTION:

What did it prove, Mr. Leader, in the

24

way of lost revenue because of tiie existence of the

Oklahoma statutes?

What it proved was, is that a share

It is tax on the removal, for the privilege of

QUESTION:

12

Did Wyoming introduce any statistics

13

to show that there was less coal removed from the ground

14

as a result of Oklahoma's statute --

15

MR. LEADER:

Quite the contrary.

The evidence

16

here, Your Honor, shows that since the act has gone into

17

effect Wyoming has produced more coal and it continues to

18

produce more coal year after year after year.

19

In fact, the second year after this act,

Oklahoma's act went into effect, there was more coal sold

So can't we kind of presume that is

what has happened?

4
5

That's right.

They have lost the market share in

Oklahoma, and what you can't presume is that that loss of
market share in Oklahoma means they had a bad year.
QUESTION:

11

No, but they would have sold that

12

coal to Oklahoma had Oklahoma's statute not required the

13

purchase of the Oklahoma coal.

What we don't know is what their

He doesn't say how he meets it, to say if he
This evidence at best is

You require the plaintiff to show their case by

6

clear and convincing evidence.

There is no clear and

7

convincing evidence in this case showing a relationship

8

between the lost market share in Oklahoma and the ultimate

9

production of Wyoming coal producers.

In fact, the

10

evidence suggests that Wyoming coal producers keep

11

producing more and more coal.

12

Now as to Oklahoma's statute itself, Oklahoma

13

freely admits that its statute does not, in the

14

constitutional sense, treat all evenhandedly, and that in

15

fact, that it does aid coal production in Oklahoma.

16

Part of this difference is based upon the

17

difference in the properties of coal in each State.

the uncontradicted, stipulated facts show, Oklahoma coal

has a much higher BTU.

I emphasize the effects that I think are more

least legitimate, but I think it is fair to presume that

all those were intents of the legislature.

MISS GUTHRIE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Oklahoma statute which the State of Wyoming

6

has challenged is a classic example of economic

7

protectionism.

8

has disrupted the current coal market by forcing Oklahoma

9

utilities to purchase Oklahoma coal rather than the

The statute is discriminatory because it

10

Wyoming coal that they were purchasing until, the statute

11

was passed.

12

We urge this Court to adopt the special master's

13

recommendation that you find the Oklahoma statute

14

unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.

15

The statute is invalid because it, on its face,

16

discriminates against interstate commerce.

17

Oklahoma utilities that sell power to Oklahoma consumers

18

to buy Oklahoma coal.

19

most blatant kind of economic protectionism that this

20

Court on many instances has invalidated.

QUESTION:

This explicit discrimination is the

Are you going to go into the question

MISS GUTHRIE:

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know --

Is there some explanation for that?

6

I mean, if they are losing money, one would think that

7

they would be as interested in it as you are, unless you

have 100 percent severance tax.
MISS GUTHRIE:

9

No, we don't.

Our severance tax

10

is 8-1/2 percent.

11

they have chosen for political purposes not to rock the

12

boat.

13

that it doesn't matter; however, the injury that the State

14

of Wyoming has sustained to the tune of at least $500,000

15

far as we are concerned.

The assumption would be that perhaps

QUESTION:

How was the $500,000 a year proven,

Ms. Guthrie?
MISS GUTHRIE:

There was an affidavit prepared

20

by a person from our tax division who looked at the amount

21

of coal that had not been sold in Oklahoma and estimated

22

how much that would be.

rebutted by the State of Oklahoma.

it's the plaintiff, and I suppose the special master could

2

make a finding that Wyoming lost a certain amount of

3

money.

4
5

Did the special master make any finding like
that?
MISS GUTHRIE:

6

Yes.

He referred to the loss of

7

severance taxes and he determined that there were those

direct injuries as a result of our loss of severance taxes

because of the statute.

MISS GUTHRIE:

12

13

Did he make any finding as to dollar

I don't recall if he did or not.

I think that he did make that finding.

14

QUESTION:

It seems to me that your affidavit,

15

while it would perhaps support a finding of loss, doesn't

16

rule out the possibility that if the coal production in

17

Wyoming didn't sell in Oklahoma, it might have found a

18

market for elsewhere.

The affidavit doesn't say that Wyoming lost tax

MISS GUTHRIE:

The affidavit does say that the

State of Wyoming lost $500,000 in tax revenues because of

coal that had not been sold to Oklahoma utilities.

MISS GUTHRIE:

to look at is the injury to the State of Wyoming as a

5

result of lack of Oklahoma sales, regardless of whether

6

Wyoming sold coal in other places. It has lost the sale to

the Oklahoma producers, Oklahoma utilities.
QUESTION:

8

That doesn't really affect the
The question that you really have

reasonable position, but it doesn't seem it is the only

one.

We have a stipulation that

17

provides that until about 1 86 virtually 100 percent of

18

all the coal burned in Oklahoma came from Wyoming, and

1

since that time, after the statute has been passed, the

20

amount of coal that has been sold to Oklahoma has been

21

reduced.

22

There was a report that was prepared by two

23

economic fuel specialists who said that but for the act,

continued to sell virtually 100 percent of the coal to

Oklahoma plants.
So there are facts that would support the fact

2

3

that this statute has changed the way that electric

4

utilities in the State of Oklahoma make their fuel

5

choices.

6

QUESTION:

So even though -- your theory is that

7

even though Wyoming did not lose a penny, its severance

8

tax revenues are as high as ever, if some of the severance

9

taxes were imposed on coal sold in Utah as replacements

10

for the sale that wasn't sold in Oklahoma, it can still

11

bring this action?

12

MISS GUTHRIE:

Our position is that because the

13

act was passed, we can fairly trace an injury to the

14

collection of severance taxes.

15

great deal of coal capacity that is not sold every year.

16

So we have, as producers and then as tax people, have

experienced an injury as a result of this act.

The State of Wyoming has a

It's also possible, Mr. Chief Justice, that

discriminatory legislation.

The first time they filed a

I would argue that, but if I am

getting questions from the Court, I wouldn't be so abrupt

10

to make that kind of argument, but the standing

issue -- because then the motion to dismiss based on

12

standing was denied.
Then the whole issue was brought up again in

13

front of Judge Tone, who had been selected as a special

15

master, and he also made a determination that

standing -- that the State of Wyoming did have standing in

this case because we had suffered an injury.

QUESTION:

The cases to which Mr. Leader refers

are cases that are this injury to the general kind of

taxing power of a State.
Maybe a State will in fact have to assess more

taxes to pay for some kind of service that they weren't

able to provide before --

7

QUESTION:

We are not talking about a sales tax.

8

It is very clear that had this contract been performed,

9

the sale would have occurred, the State would have gotten

10

X dollars from the sale, and there is a breach of the

11

contract and it seems to me, I doubt very much whether the

12

State would have any cause of action for that, as a person

13

harmed by that breach of contract, have any standing to

14

complain about it.

15

MISS GUTHRIE:

Well, we must look at this,

16

though, in the context of the Commerce Clause and also the

17

fact that this is legislation has harmed one State to the

18

benefit of another State's residents.

MISS GUTHRIE:

1

Well, you referred to the

2

prudential kind of limitations that the Court has

3

undertaken to sift out the cases it doesn't want to hear,

4

and you certainly have developed a great number of rules

that deal with standing or original actions.
And I would say that this is the kind of case

that requires an original action being taken.

There is this direct

Now, the State of Oklahoma says it is not

12

13

direct, but they have certainly never shown you through

14

any kind of -- or there was no evidence that this injury

15

that we suffered was not direct.

16

that it's not direct and I guess it is my saying that it

17

is direct.

18

It is just his saying

It certainly is direct so far as the State of

19

Wyoming is concerned because of the way that we use that

20

money and that we do impose that tax.

21

But there are several different prudential rules

22

that you have adopted, and I would suggest that virtually

The import of my question doesn't go

to whether we should take the original action or not, it

goes to whether we should think there is standing in the

Federal courts anywhere, not just here, so I agree with

10

you to that extent.
MISS GUTHRIE:

11

Once this Court has determined

12

that the State of Wyoming does have standing, you must

13

determine that the statute is invalid because it's invalid

14

on its face.
It's also invalid in its purpose. Examination of

15
16

a resolution that was passed by the State of Oklahoma in

17

1985, a year before this statute was passed, will show you

18

the kinds of things that were motivating legislators from

19

Oklahoma.

20

They referred to the fact over $300 million had

21

gone out of State because ratepayers were paying for

Wyoming coal, and $9 million had been assessed in Wyoming

of the kinds of things that this Court has disapproved of

2

because it is a discriminatory purpose.

3

There was only one purpose for this statute to

4

be passed, and that was to encourage the use of Oklahoma

5

coal. The State of Oklahoma provided no evidence in this

6

proceeding through affidavits or even in the statement of

7

material facts to the special master that would in any way

8

show that there was any kind of purpose besides some kind

9

of discriminatory economic purpose.

10

There is a very definite protectionist effect,

11

also, of the law.

12

13

The result means that there will be a

We acquired the services of an economist who

14

came up with several different ideas about why Oklahoma

15

coal was being used, and the whole conclusion that they

16

all reached was that it was only because of the

17

interference of the statute.

18

The State of Wyoming asks this Court to declare

19

the Oklahoma statute unconstitutional as an example of

20

simple economic protectionism and to apply your virtually

21

per se rule of invalidity that you have encountered

22

whenever you find a facially discriminatory statute.

We also respectfully submit that the Court does

accept standing in this case.
