MR. RAGSDALE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue here is whether an insurance agent,

12

Mr. Darden, initially found by District Judge Boyle to be

13

an independent contractor, was instead and employee of

14

Nationwide for purposes of ERISA.

15

an employee, the provisions of ERISA did not apply to him.

16

Thus, the case turns upon the proper definition of

employee.

MR. RAGSDALE:

Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court in Reid,

and citing decisions of this Court going back to 1915,

said:

you think, to affect the common law test?
MR. RAGSDALE:

2

Justice O'Connor, he discusses

it, but he does not propose it.

4

he cannot demonstrate that he is entitled to it.

5

Mr. Darden wishes it, but

There is no case that I know of - - and I've

6

looked hard because I thought somebody would ask

7

me - - there is no case that I know of which has ever

8

turned and been made distinct by applying the common law

9

principles of agency, and then twisting it one ratchet to

10

make it by considering the remedial goals of ERISA, or the

13

the exercise of considering it, and that was the district

14

court in Harlow, cited in our brief.

15

through the exercise, and when he got through he decided

16

that it made no difference to the outcome of the case.

17

Only one court that I know of has gone through

Judge Kobrines went

My answer is that it cannot be demonstrated that

18

a consideration of the remedial goals of the legislation

19

will give a different result than that which is obtained

20

by the application of the principles of the common law,

21

And as

10

far as I can tell, it will cause great confusion, and I

11

think that is one of the reasons that Mr. Wright is here

12

this morning to argue for the Department of Labor and the

13

Department of Treasury, and urge the Court not to adopt

14

the Darden test, but indeed to reverse the decision of the

15

Fourth Circuit.

QUESTION:

Do employers need to know on an

17

ongoing basis which persons are covered by ERISA and which

18

are not?

They do, Justice Kennedy, because

Ji

MR. RAGSDALE:

And it need not be funded for those who are not.
Two years -- two terms ago, in Reid, the Court

8

unanimously applied the common law of agency, declaring

9

that the correct test is the right of the hiring party to

10

control the manner and means of rendering service.

11

Boyle, the district court judge who granted summary

12

judgment -- unlike Mr. Finley, I lost, but I should have

13

won -- Judge Boyle granted summary judgment in favor of

14

Nationwide in the first place.

pertinent common law agency principles.

20

that Mr. Darden was an independent contractor.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
If I could first turn to Justice Kennedy's
question, I would like to add a few more comments.
Â«

19

Employee is a very basic term in ERISA and it's used in a

20

variety of contexts, and I can think of three where an

21

employer would very much need to know from the start

22

whether he's dealing with employees or independent

23

contractors.

benefits of employees.
Second, ERISA's nondiscrimination rules allow

2

3

tax benefits for plans only if the plans do not

4

discriminate against low-compensation employees.

5

you need to know what -- who is an employee, and who is an

independent contractor in figuring out whether there's

discrimination.

Again,

Third, whether or not a plan qualifies for tax

the plan affects employees, then the employer must comply

ERISA.

statute or not.

provide for employers to get opinion - - opinion letters

from them, revenue rulings, as they are called in the case

of the Internal Revenue Service.

18

So it's critical from the start for an employer to

And that is why both Labor and the IRS

And I think it's obvious, for the reasons Mr.

19

Ragsdale stated, that the Fourth Circuit's test, which

20

turns on the subjective reliance factors of individuals,

21

is simply not a practical test to use here.

22

after the Fourth Circuit's first decision, the district

23

court determined that Darden is an employee largely

24

because, although he had opened an individual retirement

25

account and had taken out an annuity, he had only put

We don't think that the qualification of plans
can turn on such subjective criteria.

7

Excuse me, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

9

May I -- I thought you'd finished

that thought.

10

As I understand it, although Mr. Ragsdale

11

doesn't seem to think so, I took your brief to differ a

12

little bit from -- and the Government's position to differ

13

a bit from his in that he would rely upon the common law

14

test and the Government apparently would rely primarily on

15

the common law test but not exclusively.

16

MR. WRIGHT:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's right, Your Honor.
What do you add to the common law

test?

19

MR. WRIGHT:

We do, as Justice O'Connor put it,

that Congress intends ERISA to be similarly interpreted.

it's led to a very clear answer with respect to insurance

would be proper to consider the remedial purposes of ERISA

and conclude, just as this Court concluded in applying the

common law test, that debit agents might properly be

QUESTION:

6

But why is that?

I mean, the

7

remedial purposes of ERISA include limiting ERISA to

8

employees.

9

well, since you consult the remedial purposes of ERISA,

It seems to me real bootstrapping to say,

10

and those remedial purposes are limited to employees.

11

therefore, for some reason we should expand the meaning of

12

employees?

13

MR. WRIGHT:

And

I think that there are certain

14

close cases where it1s not so much an expansion as a rule

15

of how to determine whether someone like debit agents are

to circumvent ERISA.

For instance, in that case, that was

them back to their professional corporations to provide

I ask

âœ“

1

the Court to affirm the judgment in Mr. Darden's favor,

2

allowing him to receive his retirement benefits.

3

to discuss for just a second the history of these events

4

of the statutes -- the way one could look at them.

I'd like

5

The three cases that held that a broad remedial

6

social legislation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act,

7

the National Labor Relations Act, the Social Security Act,

8

should be construed in a manner to reflect the broad

9

remedial purposes of the statute, not just use the common

10

law test, all took place in the 1940's.

11

those decisions are the ones, Hearst and U.S. v. Silk.

12

Hearst case affected the National Labor Relations Act.

13

U.S. v. Silk interpreted the Social Security Act.

14

Three -- two of

Congress, in about 1947 or '48 came back and

15

amended the Social Security Act, and also amended the

16

National Labor Relations Act to specify that the term

17

employee in those acts was to be construed using the

18

common law interpretation, the common law agency
Â«

19

interpretation.

20

Now the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is

21

interpreted in the Rutherford Food Corporation case in

22

about 1947,

23

That definition, statutory definition, is exactly the same

24

as the statutory definition of employee which is contained

25

in ERISA.

'46, has never been amended as far as I know.

1

So that if you look at the state of the law in

2

1974, and that Congress had before it when they adopted

3

ERISA, they knew that if they wanted to restrict the term

4

employee to a common law meaning, they could write it in

5

there like they had done before in the National Labor

6

Relations Act and the Social Security Act.

7

it if they wanted.

8

they didn't do that.

9

They could do

Maybe they never thought about it, but

They adopted the same interpretation as the Fair

10

Labor Standards Act.

11

that the Rutherford Food Corporation was still the law of

12

the land, and is somewhat vague and difficult to

13

understand as it was.

14

knew they were adopting the statute, like the Department

15

of Labor says, was a broad, remedial social statute.

16

And they knew when they did that

One could reasonably assume they

And they also must have known the same time that

17

under the Rutherford Food Corporation, the courts -- the

18

courts would look to the purposes of ERISA in interpreting

19

the term employee and they wouldn't be bound solely by the

20

common law.

21

a slightly more open book.

22

So that our argument is that you are writing

And I add one other - - one other fact to it.

23

That in 1961, this Court, in Goldberg v. Whitaker, held in

24

a case involving the Fair Labor Standards Act, that some

25

people who did some work at home in the crocheting field

1

were employees.

And in that case, the Court repeated the

2

ruling of the prior holdings that they'd done in

3

Rutherford Food and the Hearst case by saying that the

4

Court was not bound by the technical concepts of the

5

common law, but would look to the purposes of the statute

6

and use a definition based on the economic realities of

7

the situation.

8

in '61.

9

in 1974, when they enacted ERISA.

That was in 1961.

So the Court did that

Congress would have had that opinion before then,

language.

by the Solicitor General.

MR. FOLLIN:

And in his view, then that

do is to focus on the purposes of ERISA.

For example, one of the common law indicia

that's listed in those lists of things you see in the

However, if you look at the business he was in, which was

MR. FOLLIN:

They are assets.

Your Honor, but it seemed to me that when you're

considering the case, they're incidental to the result or

QUESTION:

2

Do you think the Fourth Circuit

opinion is consistent with Rutherford Food?

cite, as I read their opinion, the two cases that Congress

5

overruled.

They never cited Rutherford Foods.
MR. FOLLIN:

6

They only

Well, there is an inconsistency

7

there, Your Honor, because Rutherford Food considered some

8

typical common law factors as well as the purposes of the

9

statute.

10

It looked like the Fourth Circuit just focused

on the purposes of the statute.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, and Rutherford Food is much

12

closer to endorsing the common law test than Hearst or

13

Silk were, I think.

14

MR. FOLLIN:

Don't you agree with that?
Well, I'm not so sure I do.

I

15

think the Court looked more at the economic realities in

16

reaching its result.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FOLLIN:

In Rutherford Food?
Yes.

In the way these people

19

were -- they said, well, they were getting paid, you know,

20

so much, how much for each piece of item that passed on,

21

each piece of meat, or whatever they're doing.

2

And it's in both -- both in the common law definition you

3

have control and in the other one, in the Darden thing,

about who controls the details of the business.

5

In this case, the court found that Nationwide

controlled the terms of the agreement itself, that is that

7

they were able to dictate to their agents what went in it.

8

They were given the agreement, said you can sign it or

9

leave.

Now, that reflects the type of person who's -- who

needs or would be covered by ERISA.

That's possible.

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. FOLLIN:

Correct.

Because we never -- I

11

just -- it's a mistake to say -- to jump to conclusion

12

that he is an independent contractor based on what's

13

before you now because the trial court just didn't want to

hear about that.

They didn't want to spend the time

But what I am asking the Court to do is to put

18

into the standard the important relevant considerations

19

arising out of the purposes of ERISA and to avoid simply

20

adopting a common law standard that (a) doesn't have any

21

relationship to the purposes of that statute, and (b) has

22

been proven, at least to my satisfaction that did not work

They're

If you adopt the standard like that, and just

me say this.

I said that the Solicitor General discussed

this other kind of test, but that he did not propose it.

I have to stand by that.

General on that statement.

He said, the construction of

construction -- also conforms to congressional use of that

MR. RAGSDALE:

I concede that he discussed it,

as he should, but he does not propose it here.

5

Justice White has held up to the true light the

problem created by this Rutherford Foods case.

And that

7

is, he has gone over an looked at the verb, not the noun

8

employee, but he found the right answer.

9

congressional history in the verb to employ.

And he found
Because in

10

that act, that verb had a different meaning than it does

correct.

13

this country at that time, apparently many little children

14

were either being made to work or permitted to work, and

15

Congress wanted to see that (a) they weren't allowed to if

16

they weren't supposed to, and (b) if they were, they had

17

to be paid a fair wage.

18

And it was to suffer or permit to work.

And he is

That was born of the Child Labor Laws, where in

And so there is congressional history wrapped in

19

another word in the Fair Labor Standards Act cases and

20

that is in part a justification for perhaps a different

view and a different treatment.

22

In addition, and I'm not defending this, and I

23

don't want to get into certain quagmires, but in addition

24

to that, there is more congressional history, which is

that Senator Black is quoted of the floor of the Senate as

Standards Act should be, was meant to be, and would be

accorded the broadest possible use of that term.

Now, if that's legislative history, and I don't

dealt with Social Security, but you didn't manage to find

the Rutherford Food case, which dealt with the Fair Labor

When the Hearst Court focused on the history,

Well, Your Honor, the decisions

years on the books before ERISA was enacted.

We have a

long history of congressional purpose and intent in my two

favorite colors.

is no doubt that we must apply these common law

principles.

And Congress could read those.

And they

And they enacted ERISA in the face of that.
And Congress must have known that this Court

now felt that way about it and would apply and insist upon

the application of those principles in ERISA.

they would have corrected a forthcoming misapprehension by
