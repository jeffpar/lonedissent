ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD B. FINN, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FINN:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Petitioner owns and operates a private landfill

12

in St. Clair County, Michigan.

In 1 88 Michigan amended

13

its Solid Waste Management Act --

14

QUESTION:

That's up by Port Huron?

15

MR. FINN:

Yes, sir.

By adopting waste

16

importation restrictions, namely section 13(a) and

17

subsection (2) of section 30 of the act, which prohibit,

18

in the case of St. Clair County, the importation into the

1

country of municipal solid waste generated out-of-county

20

or out-of-state.

21

On its face this case presents the question of

22

whether these waste importation restrictions by

23

prohibiting the importation of out-of-state waste into

24

petitioner's landfill impermissibly discriminate against

25

out-of-state commerce by, because in-county municipal

This is not hazardous waste.

QUESTION:

This is plain

This is not low-

And garbage is your element of

commerce here, I guess?

9

MR. FINN:

Yes, sir.

10

QUESTION:

Is the waste, could it ever be said

11

to be hazardous to transport it?
MR. FINN:

12

Under the regulations that have been

13

promulgated by the State of Michigan, the transportation

14

of municipal solid waste if it is moisture laden must be

15

transported in trucks that are sealed and not capable of

16

leaking.

17

they must be covered and carried in a manner that does not

18

create a nuisance.

regulations that are - -

QUESTION:

The same would be true under the new

Well, would that aspect of it

possibly bring it in the quarantine exception?

In this case, Justice O'Connor, no

one has suggested that the quarantine cases are

24

applicable.

1

Michigan make it clear that- there is no risk of disease or

2

pestilence coming into the State, and the new regulations

3

that have been promulgated by the Federal EPA make it

4

clear that there need not be any risk of disease or

5

pestilence.

Indeed Michigan allows out-of-state waste to

neighboring states.

10
11

So I don't think the quarantine cases

are applicable.
One of the amicus has suggested that the

12

quarantine cases may be applicable, and it may well be.

13

In some states the regulations and laws are so lax as to

14

create risks, but that's not true in Michigan.

15

There is an even more important question,

16

however, at stake in this case, and that's whether or not

17

this Court is going to uphold the novel new constitutional

18

principle that was relied upon by the Sixth Circuit in

19

upholding the waste importation restrictions.

20

constitutional principle is that state legislation which

21

excludes foreign commerce from local areas within the

22

State does not discriminate against interstate commerce so

23

long as like commerce from elsewhere in the State is

24

subject to the same embargo.

25

That new

Acceptance of that new principle would have

extraordinary consequences.

2

this principle were adopted by this Court a district

3

comprised of the southern, the counties of Southern

4

California could impose an embargo upon or a

5

discriminatory tariff upon goods coming from Arizona so

6

long as like commerce coming from Northern California were

7

subject to the same constraint or the same discriminatory

8

tariff.

9
10

By way of illustration, if

That principle simply cannot be allowed to stand
.by this Court.

It is hopelessly inconsistent with the

11

prior decisions of this Court, it belies the basic

12

principles that underlie the Commerce Clause, and it would

13

eventually result in the evisceration of the negative

14

aspects - -

QUESTION:

Mr. Finn, I guess the Sixth Circuit

16

purported to apply the Pike v. Bruce Church test in this

17

case?

18
19
20

MR. FINN:

Yes, it did, Justice Scalia --

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

And do you make the argument that it

21

was, that was the wrong test to apply, or that it was the

22

correct test to apply but they applied it wrong?

23

it you're arguing?

24
25

MR. FINN:

What is

There is no question in our mind that

the Sixth Circuit applied the incorrect test.

In our

1

judgment once discrimination exists, this Court's

2

decision, decisions in the past have made it perfectly

3

clear that the strict scrutiny test should apply, and it

4

doesn't make any difference, as the State, the

5

respondents, seem to suggest, that it's local

6

discrimination versus statewide discrimination.

7

the Sixth Circuit made that distinction.

QUESTION:

Somehow

Well, what's the matter with it?

You

attack it verbally, but will you explain why you think it
isn't consistent with our cases?
MR. FINN:

Well, in Brimmer v. Rebman, which was

12

decided in 1891, in Dean Milk v. the City of Madison in

13

1954, and in Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Co., this Court

14

has held that it's immaterial for purposes of determining

15

whether there is discrimination against interstate

16

commerce that in-state commerce is subject to the same

17

constraint.

18

Rebman, Dean Milk, and Polar Ice Cream and Creamery Co.,

19

they're consistent with and they're part of a line of nine

20

cases in which this Court has over the past 119 years

21

consistently and repeatedly held that embargoes against

22

foreign commerce, be they statewide or local, overt or

23

disguised, violate the Commerce Clause.

24

not present a new concept.

25

And that, those decisions in Brimmer v.

that landfill.

QUESTION:

What the landfill

But the landfill space is just in St.

Clair County, right?

18

MR. FINN:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

Now I suppose, I suppose St. Clair

County could impose an enormous tax upon any garbage

21

brought into this landfill space.

2

It would not be discriminatory.

That's the infirmity in this statute.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but of course all the tax goes

into St. Clair County's own coffers, so as a matter of

fact it would not deter St. Clair County from using the

The discrimination is made against

the citizens and businesses of other states in this

10

instance who are prohibited from bringing municipal solid

11

waste into St. Clair County, whereas the citizens and

12

businesses of St. Clair County are free to put their waste

13

into the landfill without constraint.

14

QUESTION:

Well --

15

MR. FINN:

That discrimination is what's

16

impermissible.

17

QUESTION:

So all you're making St. Clair County

18

do is to reduce its business taxes and impose an enormous

tax on taking stuff to the landfill.

I think that is correct.

People who live there and who vote

there still have to get rid of their garbage, don't they?

7

MR. FINN:

Yes, they do, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

And they want to do it at reasonable

9

rates, I suppose.

10

MR. FINN:

Well, their alternative is not --

11

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

Do 'y°u think

12

that solid waste has today a commercial value in part?

13

Are there things included in solid waste today that make

14

it potentially a valuable item?
MR. FINN:

15

To some extent municipal solid waste

16

as it starts from our respective homes or our respective

17

businesses contains materials that can be removed from the

18

solid waste, such as recyclables, plastics, aluminum, or

19

the like.

21

municipal solid waste.

I, when the,municipal solid waste is brought to

I think the problem with suggesting that

23

municipal solid waste is not an article of commerce, which

24

has not been suggested in the briefs but is implicit in

25

the questions, is where, what is the neutral principle

that would apply.

2

usefulness it's no longer articles of commerce?

3

first of all, the neutral principle would likewise apply

4

to the dead, dead human beings, and that would make the

QUESTION:

That --

In the same manner - I-dare say lots of people would think

they weren't.
(Laughter.)
MR. FINN:

I think it's clear that Congress

11

would think that it had the power to regulate the funeral

12

home industry or the cemetery industry because it was

13

regulating a matter of interstate commerce.

14

Also, to suggest that this article of commerce

15

is not, rather that municipal solid waste is not an

article of commerce is to not, to deny reality.

18

not an article of commerce is to ignore reality.

QUESTION:

This is a

Mr. Finn, could Michigan put together

20

a scheme whereby the counties could decide that they

21

wouldn't allow any private landfills, period, and that all

22

waste disposal would be at county-owned sites?

QUESTION:

MR. FINN:

Well, I wouldn't have a private

7

QUESTION:

Right.

8

MR. FINN:

But I don't, we don't question but

9

that the state can, through the market participant

10

doctrine, restrict out-of-state waste from coming into the

11

state, into the state-owned or county-owned landfills.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Finn, I think some of our cases

13

have said that when the motive of the state appears to be

14

protectionist, parochial favoring local industry, then

15

we're going to give it strict scrutiny.

In other words, if

that, that being the case, these statutes are designed to

Mr. Chief Justice, I should also point out that

2

it's not just a question of whether or not there is or is

3

not economic protectionism.

4

Taylor the Court found that the embargo was permissible

5

because the bait fish were likely to be infected with

6

parasites, but it nonetheless subjected the Maine statute

7

to the strict scrutiny test.

8

whether the statute serves a legitimate purpose, and two,

whether there is available a non-discriminatory means.

And in the case of the Maine bait fish statute the statute

a comprehensive, mandatory, long range planning and long

12

range management process for solid waste which is to be

disposed of in each county in Michigan.

Petitioner's claim is that the Commerce Clause

exempts it from even participating in the planning

16

In this Court,

however, they have abandoned everything except the facial

13

So the sole challenge in this Court is whether this

14

comprehensive statewide statute is unconstitutional merely

circumstances in deciding whether to permit or to prohibit

Under petitioner's view in this facial challenge

19

a county can never prohibit out-of-state waste regardless

of local circumstances or local consequences.

position is that a state may implement a planning process,

as we have done here, which permits counties to take into

for what your counties do under your authorization, and in

MR. CASEY:

I would analogize to the Sporhase

3

decision.

There there was a statute regulating the

4

withdrawal and transfer of groundwater.

5

Nebraska imposed restrictions on in-state transfers and it

6

imposed different restrictions on out-of-state transfers.

7

That was one of the factors the Court looked at in saying

8

that that portion of the statute was not facially

9

discriminatory, because it imposed burdens both on in-

10

state residents and out-of-state residents.

11

same principle applies here.

12

We submit the

Significant burdens are imposed on in-county

13

residents/ and the only burden that is imposed on out-of-

14

county residents, for out-of-county waste, is that they

15

participate in the planning process, but the counties,

16

because they have assumed the burden of disposing of their

17

own, are given some ability to limit their service area.

18

In a particular case if a county did not have

19

sufficient justification for excluding out-of-county

20

waste, a prohibition might be unconstitutional as applied.

21

We don't have that challenge in this case.

amend its plan to permit 1,750 tons per day of out-ofcounty waste.
