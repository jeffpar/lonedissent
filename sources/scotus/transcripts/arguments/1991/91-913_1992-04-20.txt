ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. STEVEN AGEE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AGEE:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

14

This case involves the disposition in bankruptcy

15

of a debtor's interest in an ERISA qualified pension plan

16

which has terminated.

17

benefits in a participant's plan crosses with the

18

bankruptcy policy of marshalling all of a debtor's assets

19

for the payment of creditors in return for a fresh start.

The ERISA policy of safeguarding

The trustee in bankruptcy's position is that the

20
21

ERISA benefit is included as an asset of the bankruptcy

22

estate, subject to any exemption that exists under the

23

code.

24
25

If this is the law, what are the pubic policy
results of it?

Would there be multitudes left destitute

by attachment of the pension interest' in bankruptcy?

2

Would pension plans be cancelled or a pension plan

3

administration made untenable, and would there be an

4

improper change to the uniformity of application of ERISA

5

rules?
I would submit that the answer to those

questions is no.

bankruptcy.
The first ground of defense in that case would

%

12

be the spendthrift-type protection that exists in an ERISA

13

plan by reason of ERISA's requirement that every plan have

14

an anti-alienation protection.

15

whether you worked on the line for Ford Motor Company or

16

were the chief executive officer, your ability to control

the distribution out of the pension for your benefit the

limited, if existing at all.

Mr. Justice White, I think what that

What does that have to do with the

beneficiary.

It protects the entitlement of the

Let me go directly, in answer to that

10

question, to the legal argument with respect to an

11

exclusion and an exemption out of the bankruptcy code.

12

Congress has only apparently spoken one time

13

directly, either in ERISA or the bankruptcy code, as to

14

when an exemption for an ERISA benefit would exist.

15

the exemption section of the bankruptcy code Congress

16

specifically said that the debtor's interest in a pension

17

plan, qualified under section 401(a) would be exempt,

18

limited to the reasonable needs of the debtor.

19

In

That establishes an exemption in bankruptcy

20

which could not exist if the interest in the ERISA plan is

21

first excluded from the estate under section 541(c) (2) of

22

the code.

25

QUESTION:

But this section applies to all

pension plans or not?
MR. AGEE:

Section 522?

Section 522 makes a

division into two different categories.

2

the District of Columbia, which is a non-opt-out State, it

3

uses the Federal exemptions.

4

Virginia, which is the majority of States, they do not

5

have this reasonable needs of the debtor limitation.

However, if there exists --

QUESTION:

In, for distance,

In opt-out States such as

Yes, but it would apply to, not just

ERISA pension plans, wouldn't it?

9

MR. AGEE:

That -- that's correct.

522 --

10

QUESTION:

But if it is an ERISA plan you have a

11

provision in ERISA plans that may not be present in other

12

plans, namely, that it is not subject to attachment.

13

MR. AGEE:

Mr. Justice White, that's correct.

14

And I would say that the key point that comes out that is

15

that if there is first an exclusion out of the bankruptcy

16

estate, by virtue of the applicable nonbankruptcy law

17

language in section 541(c)(2), then you would never be

18

able to get to the exemption provision.

19

That would in effect write out of the code in

20

the non-opt-out States the provision that limits to the

21

reasonable needs of the debtor the exemption under ERISA.

22

QUESTION:

Well, on your provision you are

23

writing out of the code, ERISA as a nonbankruptcy

24

applicable law.

1

Justice White, -for two reasons.

One, if you attribute to

2

the language in 522(d)(10)(e) the plain meaning that

3

Congress has written in that there is to be an exemption
%

4

limited to the reasonable needs of the debtor, you write

5

out effectively an exclusion, if it were to exist under

6

541(c)(2).

7

Otherwise, that serves no function.
That is true there are church plans and some

8

government plans that would still function under this

9

section 522(d).

10

would be written out.

20

QUESTION:

Thank you.

21

MR. AGEE:

The bankruptcy trustee would be able

22

to access, if the ERISA benefit is included as part of the

23

estate, only that to which the debtor could have accessed.

24

If there was no ability of the debtor to get into the plan

25

at the time they filed bankruptcy, to take something out,

1

the bankruptcy could accede to no greater than the debtor

2

had.

3

That is another reason that I believe that the

4

inclusion in the estate of the ERISA benefit would be of

5

limited significance to most participants in most plans.
QUESTION:

6

Well, it might be of limited

7

significance, but it's still the case that there is not a

8

complete identity of the subjects to which the exclusion

9

and the exempt apply.

So you cannot -- I take you agree,

10

you cannot make the argument that the one is rendered sort

11

of totally useless by the other.
MR. AGEE:

12

Mr. Justice Souter, I do to this

13

extent:

14

omnibus exclusion of ERISA benefits under 541(c) (2), using

15

that applicable nonbankruptcy law language, then if you

16

came to the exemption section, the only place where the

17

Congress apparently has said explicitly, this is where we

18

are dealing with an ERISA benefit, and it has placed, at

19

least in the non-opt-out States, a limitation to the

20

reasonable needs of the debtor, I submit that that is

21

written out of the code because you have created first an

22

omnibus - -

23

that if you conclude first that there is an

QUESTION:

That may be written out with respect

24

to the ERISA plans, but there are still going to be plans

MR. AGEE:

But if there is an inclusion of the

plan doesn't cover it for some reason, or if the

21

bankruptcy trustee was able to access an asset that the

not be affected to any significant degree because the

processing of many, many qualified domestic relations

Mr. Agee, could I ask you a question

because I must confess I am having a little difficulty

7

following the argument.

9

it unnecessary to reach 522.

As I understood the court of

Is that correct?

10

MR. AGEE:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

And am I also correct that your

12

argument based on this (d)(2), whatever, relates solely to

13

522?

14

MR. AGEE:

No, Mr. Justice Stevens.

What I am

15

saying is that the plain meaning of this 522(d), the

16

exemption provision, has Congress writing, for the only

17

time, either in the bankruptcy code or ERISA, how will we

18

treat ERISA benefits in bankruptcy?

QUESTION:

It doesn't refer to ERISA though.

20

That's why you mislead me.

21

doesn't say ERISA.

22

MR. AGEE:

I am looking around.

It

Well, it refers to, on page 4, three

23

triple I's, plans -- it's done in the negative, but plans

24

to qualify under section 401(a).

25

QUESTION:

And that is ERISA.

MR. AGEE:

1

2

No, that would include other«types of

plans including Government plans.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but that shoots your argument.

4

MR. AGEE:

Well, I hope that it doesn't.

5

QUESTION:

That utterly destroys your argument.

6

MR. AGEE:

Because if you are going to accord

7

plain meaning to this particular section, then reasonable

8

needs limitations for private plans, pension plans, stock

9

bonus plans, profit-sharing plans, that's gone.

And when'

10

this section was drafted, placed into the code, the

11

bankruptcy commissioners' report was very specific in what

12

they wanted to get at here.

13

They were to exempt the private employer plans

14

and the reason that the reasonable needs limitation was

15

put in there was that in recognition, as here, that there

16

would be substantial benefits held by corporate officers

17

and by members of professional corporations.

18

exactly what I think the Congress was trying to get at in

19

this provision.
QUESTION:

20

That is

But even if ERISA is excluded under

21

the earlier provision, you would still need this provision

22

to cover some plans other than ERISA, as to which you

23

wanted only the reasonable needs limitation; isn't that

24

right?

25

So it would still make sense.
MR. AGEE:

It would still make sense as long as

1

-- if you read out 522(d) the coverage for pension plans,

2

stock bonus plans and profit-sharing plans, which would be

3

private plans.

4

QUESTION:

Right.

5

MR. AGEE:

And I don't think the Congress would

6

have intended that if they would have included that

7

language in the statute.
QUESTION:

8
9

Maybe not, but you can't say that it

is utterly illogical.

You might say that it doesn't cover

1

very much, but it still covers something that you would

11

need that language to cover, despite the fact that you had

12

excluded ERISA earlier.
MR. AGEE:

13

It would -- that's correct.

It would

14

still continue to cover a Government plan and a State

15

plan.

16

QUESTION:

A little bit.

17

MR. AGEE:

There is another issue here in

18

dealing in particular with the exemption question which

19

differentiates this particular case from other cases the

2

Court has heard before.

21

When there have been garnishment or levy-

22

statutes, State statutes which have attempted to reach

23

into a pension plan and take something out, they have been

24

preempted by that language in ERISA, section 514(a) which

25

preempts State law.

(2 2)289-226
(8 ) FOR DEPO

1

But ERISA also includes another section thAt

2

some would call a Federal preemption statute which does

3

not say that ERISA overrides other Federal law, but it

4

says that ERISA will not impair, invalidate or supersede

5

other Federal law.

6

And I would submit that the bankruptcy code

7

entering the picture fits into that circumstance, that if

8

the all inclusive scope of section 541 of the code, which

9

is to include all of the debtor's legal and equitable

10

interests in property, are brought into the code, that if

11

the anti-alienation provision of ERISA overrides it, then

12

it has impaired, superseded and ‘certainly modified the

13

all-inclusive scope of property that was intended to be

14

included in.the bankruptcy estate.

15

If you do reach the supposition that there is

16

not an exclusion of ERISA benefits from the bankruptcy

17

estate, there would still remain the question under

18

section 522 as to what kind of an exemption exists if any

19

in an opt-out State.

20

The bankruptcy trustee's position that there is,

21

there is -- there are exemptions but that they are limited

22

to the exemptions created by State law.

QUESTION:

But I didn't understand you had made

that argument yet, and that is the argument the court of
appeals addressed and disagreedwith.

11

MR. AGEE:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

Now, why are they wrong?

13

MR. AGEE:

There are several reasons.

The first

14

is this articulation that I attempted to make that says

15

the Congress has dealt with ERISA benefits as a matter of

16

exemption over here in 522(d), and they put this

17

reasonable needs limitation in here.

18

So if you say first under 541(c)(2) that you

19

exclude all the benefits, then with respect to the private

20

employer plans, which are the prime focus of the exemption

21

section -- not the exclusive, but a primary -- that the

22

reasonable needs limitation isn't going to be there for

23

any of those ERISA benefits, a plain meaning type

24

argument.

So you say, to G these two sections

you have to just say that ERISA is not an nonbankruptcy

11

MR. AGEE:

In that section, 541(c) (2), the

argument has been made in all the other lower courts that

the law -- the applicable nonbankruptcy law is limited to

State law in that section.

QUESTION:

Can I interrupt you again?

Why

18

wouldn't your argument about making the reasonable needs

thing superfluous apply also to a State law of spendthrift

trust, because there you had no reasonable needs

21

limitation if it qualifies as spendthrift trust under

22

State law.

protection applies, then it has taken the property out of

the estate by this specific statutory exclusion before you

3

get to the exemption provision.

4

QUESTION:

Exactly.

5

MR. AGEE:

And in the legislative history of

6

this section, the discussion is on the continuing over of

7

the pre-code practice of honoring spendthrift trust

8

protection under State law.

9

closely related sections in the bankruptcy code to this

There are -- the two most

10

one which are 541(c)(1) that deals with what laws

11

interfere with inclusion of property in the estate, and

12

522(b)(2)(b), which is tenants by the entirety property.

13

The phrase, applicable nonbankruptcy law is

14

limited to State law in those cases, the two most closely

15

related.

16

statutes, I think it is legitimate to look beyond it into

17

the legislative history to see this indication toward

18

State law.

So with that degree of difference between the

But if ERISA then boils down to a question of

20

exemption, the question in the non-opt-out State is

settled, the reasonable needs of the debtor.

exemption?

Lastly, I would add a word about the rule that

the Court has discussed in Dewsnup v. Timm extending the

6

there is a pre-code practice, unless it is set aside by

7

specific language of the bankruptcy code, or by the

8

legislative history, that practice carries over post­

code .

10

In those cases where

There was a pre-code, and in fact, in some

11

cases, post-ERISA practice that included assets from a

12

plan which were in pay status such as we have here from a

13

terminated plan prior to the time that Chapter 7

14

proceedings began.

15

This practice is not negated in the bankruptcy

16

code or even mentioned in the legislative history, and I

17

will submit that that practice carries over under the rule

18

from the Dewsnup and MidAtlantic cases.

19

The inclusion of the ERISA benefits would cover

20

comparatively few participants but it would cover those

21

who have the ability to access plan assets the day before

22

they file bankruptcy.

23

consideration is that we want to protect this stream of

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Mr. Shumate's interest in the Coleman Furniture

judicial exception should be made to the considered

Second, no

1

congressional policy choice that this Court recognized in

2

Guidry for beneficiaries who file bankruptcy.

3

property interests should be treated the same whether a

4

debtor is in bankruptcy or outside of bankruptcy.

5

And third,

Turning to the first reason, the plain meaning.

6

The language of 541(c)(2) says that where a trust contains

7

an enforceable restriction on the transfer of a beneficial

8

interest that is enforceable under applicable bankruptcy

9

law, the restrictions recognized in bankruptcy and

10

operates to exclude that interest from assets of the

bankruptcy estate.

A lot of ERISA plans are pension

19

MR. HUENNEKENS:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Well, 522 speaks of pension plans and

21

it says how much of it can be exempted.

22

why do you exclude ERISA plans from that provision?

23

MR. HUENNEKENS:

And how do you --

The reason, Mr. Justice White,

24

that ERISA plans exclude from 541(c) (2) is because ERISA

25

requires that qualified plans, the pension plan, the

1

assets be held in a trust.
It also requires that the trust impose a

2

3

restriction on the transfer of a beneficiary's interest in

4

the trust.

5

So for those%two reasons it qualifies as -QUESTION:

Well, I know.

My question is, why

6

doesn't an ERISA plan fall under 522(d), where it says --

7

where it limits the amount of a pension plan that is

8

exempt from administration?

9

MR. HUENNEKENS:

There may very well be a slight

10

overlap between the two provisions, but that is not

11

necessarily fatal.

12

Section 522 deals with -- 522(d)(10)(e) deals

13

with many different kinds of pension plans and in addition

14

to pension plans, deals with profit-sharing plans and

15

other types of interest such as stock bonus plans.

16

also would cover unqualified plans, such as a deferred

17

compensation plan.

18

It

So the universe covered by 522(d)(10) is very

19

different from the restriction in 541 (c.) (2) which covers

20

only a small majority -- minority of these plans which is

21

the ERISA-qualified plan.

22

And then to get to the section (iii), which

23

covers a restriction for insiders, basically, when a plan

24

is established that says, well, for them, under section

25

522, only plans that qualify under these certain sections

So the exemption would be necessary because

10

those assets are not held in a trust and are not subject

11

to the exclusion of section 541(c) of the bankruptcy code.

12

Turning back to the plain meaning of section

•

13

541, nothing in the statute itself suggests that section

14

541(c)(2) was meant to refer only to State spendthrift

15

trust law as the petitioner suggests.

16

There -- the term, applicable nonbankruptcy law

17

is intentionally broad and it is unqualified on its face.

18

In other portions of the bankruptcy code, that same term

19

is used, and in each occurrence it refers to both Federal

20

law and State law and not simply to State law.

MR. HUENNEKENS:

Just not for ERISA plans.

And

10

the reason it is not just for ERISA plans and why it is

important, is because many of the practices that ERISA

12

actively encourages would be prohibited or violate the

And if you exemptions that operate

8

MR. HUENNEKENS:

9

Justice, is yes.

The easy answer, Mr. Chief

But in the area of ERISA, what we are

finding is that ERISA preemption provisions are being held

11

to preempt State law exemptions.

Mr. Justice White, in response to your question,

additional powers that support or promote the concept of

equality of distribution among creditors, such as being

3

able to avoid preferences and pursuing fraudulent

QUESTION:

Well, outside of bankruptcy,

creditors can just sue and attach.

they can't.

MR. HUENNEKENS:

Inside a bankruptcy,

That's exactly right, Justice

9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

So the property is treated

differently.
MR. HUENNEKENS:

The property is subject to an

13

automatic stay, so the creditors cannot reach the

14

property, but the property is there to be liquidated for

15

the benefit of the creditors by a trustee and then equally

16

divided among all creditors under the distribution

17

provisions of the bankruptcy code rather than allowing one

18

creditor to attach and beat out the other creditors.

19

And that would be the policy difference that,

20

would occur in bankruptcy.

But with regard to what

21

property can be reached, the laws are uniform inside of

22

bankruptcy and out, otherwise, creditors would be

23

encouraged to file involuntary bankruptcies and force

24

creditors into bankruptcy, which is a policy which has not

25

been encouraged under the law.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. STEVEN AGEE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. AGEE:

3
4
5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I have only three points in rebuttal.

With

6

respect to the Guidry case, the first major distinction of

7

Guidry is of course that it was not a bankruptcy case.

8

Unlike a lot of previous decisions that dealt with the

9

application of ERISA protecting benefits from State law

10
11

claims, Guidry did involve another Federal statute.
But the point of distinction, as I recall the

12

course of opinion, was that the statute in effect there,

13

the Labor Management Relations Act, had its own savings

14

clause, its own preemption provision that said it would

15

not interfere with another Federal law.

16

concluded, in effect, that the ERISA provision that says

17

it will not modify or impair other Federal law, the two

18

trumped each other and therefore ERISA could prevail over

19

the Labor Management Relations Act.

•

*

20

But in this case there is no similar provision

21

in the bankruptcy code and there is no exception in ERISA

22

or anywhere else that I am aware of, from this Federal

23

preemption provision within ERISA itself that would make

24

the bankruptcy code subservient to ERISA in that

25

circumstance.

There is some discussion of the concept of the

fresh start, which is an important part of the bankruptcy

3

codes provisions.

4

submit that the fresh start is not at all what was

5

anticipated in drafting the bankruptcy code where you have

6

an exemption for the tools of the trade, some small

7

exemption for household goods, things of that nature.

8

Because in this case, if the decision is in

There is no requirement,

And lastly, to speak about the harmonization of

the various code sections, this provision within ERISA

18

that says it will not supersede or impair other Federal

19

law functions like the all-inclusive scope of the

20

bankruptcy estate under section 541 is harmonized with

21

this reasonable needs exemption in section 522 that deals

22

with those exemptions.

23

25

So I submit there is a harmonization by reading
the code as the bankruptcy trustee suggests.
And I would submit to the Court that to honor

1

the plain meaning of this reasonable needs exemption in

2

bankruptcy under 522, there should be no exclusion from

3

the estate under 541(c) (2) and that the bankruptcy code's

preexisting practice dealing with benefits that are

over, post-code and apply in this case.
