ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. ROTTIER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROTTIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case before the Court today in this case

11

relates to the definition of punitive damages as that term

12

is used in the Federal Tort Claim Act.

13

structure of the Federal Tort Claim Act is premised on

14

three features.

15

The basic

The first is that in these cases the United

16

States is to be treated as would a private individual if

17

it were a defendant in a tort claim.

18

is that the law of the State where the tort occurred is to

19

be applied, and the third feature is that certain

20

exceptions are engrafted in the law.

21

exceptions, namely the punitive damage exception, is the

22

one that the Court is concerned with today.

23

The second feature

One of those

It is our position that if the Government's

24

definition of punitive damages is to be accepted as it was

25

by the Seventh Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, it would

1

emasculate the objectives of the Federal Tort Claim Act,

2

because it would result in the Government not being

3

treated as would an individual citizen if the individual

4

citizen were the defendant, and that's the --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Rottier, do you think that this

6

punitive damages exception to governmental liability under

7

the act is a question of Federal law, which requires

8

uniformity?

9

MR. ROTTIER:

I believe the definition of

10

punitive damages as used in the exclusionary clause is a

11

matter of Federal law.

12

QUESTION:

So that does not depend, then, on the

13

law of the particular State which would otherwise govern

14

tort liability?

15

MR. ROTTIER:

That's correct, but I -- but I

16

believe the Federal interpretation should bear in mind the

17

other objectives of the act, one of which is to treat the

18

Government as an individual citizen would be treated if it

19

were a defendant.

20

QUESTION:

Well, except -- except it doesn't.

I

21

mean, you treat the Government as an individual citizen

22

except with respect to punitive damages.

23

to me you're sort of begging the question when you say you

24

have to treat the Government the same way you treat

25

everybody else.

I mean, it seems

You don't with respect to punitive

1

damages.
MR. ROTTIER:

2

The approach I would suggest is

3

the one used by the this Court in the Neustadt case, where

4

the issue was how to define misrepresentation, since that

5

is also an excluded basis of liability for the Government,

6

and there what the Court did was to look at the commonly

7

accepted definition of misrepresentation as it existed at

8

the time the Federal Tort Claim Act was enacted.

9

I would suggest that this Court should do the

10

same thing with respect to punitive damages.

11

believe the Court would find is there was general

12

consensus among the writers and among the courts as to

13

what punitive damages are, and the definition, for

14

example, that was used by this Court in the Milwaukee

15

railroad case going back to 1875 focuses on the nature of

16

the conduct of the defendant as opposed to the effect of

17

the receipt of the damages by the plaintiff.

18

And what I

I think that's where the Flannery court and the

19

Molzof court deviated from an appropriate approach to this

20

problem.

21

award on the plaintiff, as opposed to focusing on the

22

basis of imposing the award.

23

They focused on the effect of the receipt of the

In this case, one might ask this question:

24

would Mr. Molzof have been entitled to future medical

25

expenses if the defendant were a private hospital instead

of a veterans' hospital?

2

under Wisconsin law, that, yes, he would have been.

3

then, to remain in keeping with the -- one of the

4

objectives of the act, the Government should be treated

5

the same, unless -- unless the basis for awarding these is

6

the basis on which punitive damages are normally awarded.
QUESTION:

7
8

The answer is absolutely clear,

What principle of Wisconsin law is it

that leads you to answer that question the way you did?
MR. ROTTIER:

9

Under traditional Wisconsin common

10

law in tort cases, if a plaintiff can show that the

11

negligence of a defendant was a substantial factor

12

contributing to the need for future medical expenses,

13

those are awardable.

14

subrogated to someone who has paid them.

15

true.

16

And

In some instances, they're
That much is

In this case, for example, this entire problem

17

that's presented could easily be remedied by Congress.

18

Congress had approached the Federal Tort Claims Act as

19

strictly a compensation act and defined what elements of

20

compensation were to be included, it would be much more

21

easily applied.

22

situation, it could have enacted a set-off procedure, just

23

as it did for disability benefits under 38 U.S.C. 351 --

24

and the Court I am sure is familiar with that.

25

If

Or, if it wanted to avoid this type of

and it causes an increase in disability benefits, the
Government, pursuant to section 351, suspends payment of

3

the previously enacted and previously ordered disability

4

payments so that a double payment does not result.

5

is what two of the circuits have recommended to Congress

6

over the years, in the Feeley case in 1964 and in the

7

Ulrich case.
In both of those instances - - those are the only

9

That

two circuit cases before Molzof where this particular

10

issue was presented -- both of those circuits said that

11

they were uncomfortable with the potential of a double

12

recovery, but that the resolution of that problem was for

13

Congress, not for the courts.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Rottier, I suppose you're just

*
15

arguing that this is governed by State law, right, and if

16

a State chose not to allow double recovery, then there

17

wouldn't be.

18

Is that so, or not?

MR. ROTTIER:

That's correct.

19

example -- and I think it is -- this problem can be dealt

20

with through State law, if for example a -- under State

21

law a particular type of compensatory damage is deemed to

22

be excessive, then it can be - - then it is certainly not

23

awarded.

25

gave rise to this discussion generally, where you had a

1

comatose individual, where $1.3 million was awarded for

2

that, the Federal court could merely have addressed that

3

issue on the basis of excessiveness.

4

the circuit court, the court of appeals, felt that under

5

the State law such damages were awardable, it could have

6

diminished them on the basis of excessiveness.
QUESTION:

7

If it thought -- if

Well, did Judge Shabaz actually award

8

damages here, or did he say these are what you would be

9

entitled to accept for the punitive damages exception?

10

He

was affirmed by the court of appeals, wasn't he?
MR. ROTTIER:

11

That's -- you're correct on both

12

points.

13

a finding as to what they would be were they not

14

prohibited and did they not fall within the exclusion as

15

being punitive damages, and that was affirmed by the

16

Seventh Circuit.

17

The judge did not award damages.

QUESTION:

The judge made

May I ask you a question, Mr.

18

Rottier?

You said, if this individual had been in a

19

private hospital rather than a Government hospital, it's

20

perfectly clear that under Wisconsin law there would have

21

been a recovery for the lost medical expenses, the large

22

amount in dispute.

23

a matter of Wisconsin law, that if this were -- case were

24

tried in a Wisconsin court on the present facts, that a

25

Wisconsin court would have awarded this kind of potential

But it's not equally clear, is it, as

2

double recovery?
MR. ROTTIER:

To the contrary.

I think it is

3

clear that the finder of fact in such a situation, which

4

would have been a jury, would have had to address the very

5

same questions of duration of Mr. Molzof's life, and the

6

reasonable amount of the future medical expenses, but they

7

would have been awarded.

11

QUESTION:

But might they not have given credit

for the full amount of the care that the Federal
Government is going to give to this individual?
MR. ROTTIER:

Under Wisconsin law, that would

12

have been viewed as a collateral source, and that would

13

not have been factored in with respect to the award of

14

future damages.

15

QUESTION:

Well, how can you be so sure it would

16

have been viewed as a collateral source?

MR. ROTTIER:

This is not an

In Wisconsin, and partly from

19

experience, in Wisconsin governmental benefits are viewed

20

as a collateral source.

21

State-of-Wisconsin-paid benefits as well as certain

22

Federal benefits there is subrogation for past

23

expenditures, but there is no statutory subrogation for

24

Wisconsin-paid benefits for in the future.

25

QUESTION:

However, with respect to both

Well, is there a set-off?

The

1

Government really argues this is a set-off, doesn't it?

2

Is there set-off under Wisconsin law?
MR. ROTTIER:

3
4

It does affect eligibility under

Wisconsin law.
QUESTION:

5

Well, suppose the Wisconsin defendant

6

was a hospital, and that hospital had entered into a

7

contract after the injury to give lifetime care.

8

that have been a set-off under Wisconsin law?
MR. ROTTIER:

9

Would

I know of no such arrangements.

10

do not believe it would have been, because it would

11

compel - -

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Because it -- because it -- it seems

to me that's quite different from a collateral source.
MR. ROTTIER:

The way the set-off provisions

15

work in Wisconsin with respect to State-paid benefits is

16

that the receipt of an award for future medical expense

17

affects eligibility.

18

I

QUESTION:

Yes, but this is not just a State-

19

paid benefit, I think that's the point that's being made.

20

It is State-paid, and yes, that's a collateral source, but

21

this is a defendant-paid benefit, as well.

22

distinctive thing, and you don't know of any defendant-

23

paid cases.

25

MR. ROTTIER:

That's the

None that have been reported.

1

relating to health maintenance organizations and attempts

2

to subrogate them for future medical expenses, but those

3

have not been reported.

4

The point I was trying to make, members of the

5

Court, is that this is a problem which is very easily

6

remedied by congressional action or, in fact, by action by

7

the Veterans Administration, because all that needs to be

8

done is that eligibility for future veterans' benefits is

9

affected by receipt of an award for future medical

10

expense, just as they did with section 351 by affecting

11

eligibility for future disability payments once a veteran

12

has received an award pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims

13

Act.

14

QUESTION:

Well, if the suggestions made by my

15

colleagues here are correct, perhaps whatever problem

16

exists could be remedied simply by the fact-finder, the

17

awarder of damages in the Federal Tort Claims Act case, if

18

in fact the collateral source doctrine as applied in

19

Wisconsin doesn't squarely cover this subject.

20

MR. ROTTIER:

I think the deficiency in that

21

approach, Mr. Chief Justice, is that it will require

22

Federal courts to evaluate each and every element of

23

compensatory damages and address the effect of their

24

receipt on the plaintiff, instead of focusing on what I

25

think is the more appropriate question, which is, on what

1

2

basis is an award being made.
Is it on the basis of negligence which is

3

compensable, or is it on the basis of more egregious

4

conduct which rises to the level of that which would

5

support punitive damages?

6

type of conduct which is prohibited.

7
8

QUESTION:

It's an award based on that

Well, what I'm suggesting is not that

this comes within the punitive damages exception, but that
perhaps the district judge sitting in Madison might

10

conclude that although Wisconsin law follows the

11

collateral source doctrine, this is not, strictly

12

speaking, a collateral source question, so perhaps, even

13

without any action from Congress, the plaintiff is not

14

entitled to double recovery.

15

MR. ROTTIER:

Some courts in fact have used that

16

approach with respect to medical expenses paid by the

17

Government prior to trial.

18

was made for past medical expenses incurred prior to trial

1

because of the concern raised in those Federal courts,

20

including the Seventh Circuit in the Green case.

Indeed, in this case, no claim

21

However, the problem with that is that you force

22

the fact-finder --by finding that this is the only source

23

of medical care the plaintiff will use for the balance of

24

his or her life, you essentially force the fact-finder to

25

make that plaintiff a life-long prisoner of that health

care provider, whoever it may be.

2

If we stepped outside of the Veterans

3

Administration for the moment and said this were a private

4

hospital --

5

QUESTION:

That would be a very bad thing for

6

Wisconsin to do, let's agree with you.

7

it's -- I mean, if it's State law, it's State law.

8

-- you're talking to the wrong -- to the wrong --

9

MR. ROTTIER:

But if it's -- if
You're

Well, I very much agree with you.

10

If it's State law, it's State law, and that's what I'm

11

asking be applied here.

12

allow an award of future medical expense, irrespective of

13

any future obligation on the part of a private insurance

14

company or the Government to make payment for those

15

medical expenses.

16

QUESTION:

State law in Wisconsin would

Well, you don't have a case that says

17

that, though.

You don't have a case in which the

18

defendant in the particular case has, before the verdict

19

come in, committed itself to provide all of the -- provide

20

the - - what would otherwise be paid for - -

21

MR. ROTTIER:

22

QUESTION:

I have no such case --

And it's certainly not beyond the

23

realm of possibility that the Wisconsin court would say,

24

this is a double recovery, it's a set-off.

25

seems to me all you should be asking for is to have us

didn't decide it in this case.

And the district judge certainly

MR. ROTTIER:

Nor does the Government know of

10

any such case, at least as reflected by its brief, and it

11

would strike me - -

12

QUESTION:

But it's certainly not a frivolous

13

position, when the family seems happy with the Government

14

service it's getting in the future to say the Government

15

shouldn't have to pay for it twice.

16

you're right, as a matter of Wisconsin law, but it

17

certainly is an arguable point, isn't it?

18

MR. ROTTIER:

I mean, it's -- maybe

I'm not contending it's a

19

frivolous position.

What I am contending is that this

20

very issue, as serious as it is, was raised in the Feeley

21

and the Ulrich courts, and both of them said, this is a

22

serious problem, Congress should remedy it.

23

chosen not to remedy it, even though it took care of the

double payment potential with respect to disability

benefits, and it took care of it very simply in 38 U.S.C.

QUESTION:

3

those -- States that choose to make it a serious problem.

4

I mean, it is a serious problem where a State would allow

the double recovery, and that's what we don't know is the

situation here.

7

What were those other -- those other cases, did they

8

involve Wisconsin law, or the law of other States?

9

-%

But it's only a serious problem in

It may not be a problem in Wisconsin.

MR. ROTTIER:

It was the law of other States.

10

One was Pennsylvania and the other New York, and then

11

there are lower court decisions in Connecticut and the

12

Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which followed the same

13

principle.

14

QUESTION:

Well, you seem to have -- if you get

15

you want, you seem to concede that there would be a double

recovery.

MR. ROTTIER:

I don't necessarily concede that,

18

but what it would do - - I concede it creates the

potential.

for something that you're not out of pocket for.

QUESTION:

1

And yet -- and yet you say that

2

every -- every dollar you want, you would categorize as

3

compensatory?

4

MR. ROTTIER:

Every dollar we're requesting I

5

would categorize as nonpunitive, and if it is nonpunitive,

6

it falls outside the exclusion.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what is it if it isn't

compensatory or punitive?

9

MR. ROTTIER:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ROTTIER:

Well, as the Court knows --

What do you call that?
As the Court knows, there's been

12

much written about those two components and whether

13

they're totally mutually exclusive or not.

14
15

If you look at them from the perspective of the
basis on which they're awarded --

16

QUESTION:

So I suppose you would lose if we

17

concluded that anything that is not compensatory is

18

punitive?

19

MR. ROTTIER:

Yes, but I respectfully disagree

20

with the approach.

I think the approach would be from the

21

perspective of what is the basis on which the damages are

22

being awarded, because that was how punitive damages were

23

defined traditionally at the time the Federal Tort Claims

24

Act was imposed.

25

because of the egregious conduct of the defendant.

It's those damages which were imposed

Would you say that actual damages

doctrine were compensatory?

Essentially

what he said is, all future damages for medical care,

is that there are only two kinds of tort damages, a matter

MR. WRIGHT:

I know of no State that defines it,

that has a third category, and frankly I don't think

opposing counsel was able to come up with a third category

12

today.

13

We think that there are basically only two.
We admit that it is sometimes difficult to

calculate tort damages, and we do not contend that

15

compensatory damages need to be made with a sort of a

scientific precision that is impractical.

circuit took rest on -- on -- on sort of this, I think

improper inference that because punitive damages do not

compensate the pecuniary loss, any damages which do not

compensate the pecuniary loss are punitive?

9

And if we reject that inference, which is an

10

improper inference, then we're -- we're simply thrown back

11

on the definition of punitive damage that your brother

came up with, and he says the way to solve the problem of

what to do with nonpecuniary loss is simply determine the

basis upon which the damage is awarded.

nonpecuniary losses are normally thought of as

MR. WRIGHT:

courts say that it is a different sort of nonpecuniary but

compensatory loss.

that anything which is not compensatory either in a

MR. WRIGHT:

1

An element of agreement has

2

actually occurred during the course of the briefing of

3

this case.

4

that punitive damages is defined according to Federal law.

5

The question is, what did Congress mean in 1946 when it --

6

when it enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act?

We now all agree, and it was stated today,

At that time, of course, it was well understood,

7
8

as it is today, that the purpose of tort damages, the

9

primary purpose, is compensatory.

Opposing counsel was

10

kind enough to reference the New York Court of Appeals

11

McDougald case.

12

case.

13

always start in tort cases with the principle that

14

compensation is the goal, not punishment.

I would like to further recommend that

It -- the court explains in some detail that we

QUESTION:

15

Yes, but it is true, is it not, that

16

at least in this paragraph of the statute the word

17

"compensatory" doesn't appear?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

That's right, Your Honor.
It only appears in the death action

section.
MR. WRIGHT:

I think that Congress in 1946

22

understood that there was one exception to the rule that

23

punitive damages -- I mean, I'm sorry -- that compensatory

24

damages are the purpose for awarding damages in tort.

25

that exception was, and with relatively few exceptions

And

1

continues to be, that the occasion for departing from the

2

rule is when the behavior of the tort-feasor is

3

particularly egregious.
In 1946, I think Congress could -- would -- must

4
5

have thought courts would award compensatory damages and

6

they would award noncompensatory damages only in the

7

circumstances where there was a judgment of maliciousness.
QUESTION:

8

Supposing you had a situation instead

9

of your double recovery where you had a no-fault program

10

in the State system and they awarded - - they set precise

11

recoveries for different kinds of injuries like you do

12

under workman's compensation, and they were demonstrably

13

30 percent higher than the actual compensation required.

14

Would you have to shave off the excess under your theory?
MR. WRIGHT:

I'm sorry, a workers compensation

award?
QUESTION:

Say you have a no-fault tort program

18

in which the amount of damages for different kinds of

19

injuries are set by statute, as they are in the workman's

20

compensation program, and those amounts were deliberately

21

set by the legislature at maybe 25 or 30 percent above

22

what they would calculate to be actual damages, to add a

23

little deterrence and to -- and to take care of possible

24

inflation, one thing and another.

25

little high at the start.

They just fixed them a

What would happen under such a statute under

1

2

3

your view?

Would part of that be punitive?
MR. WRIGHT:

I would think in the general case,

4

no, our position is not that compensation can be and must

5

be awarded exactly, and I can well imagine a State

6

situation that we would not challenge where a damage was

7

an approximately, as most nonpecuniary damage awards are.

8

I was troubled when you added to your

9

hypothetical situation where a State intentionally said

10

we're going to add 25 percent on top for deterrent effect.

11

It seems to me quite clear that in that situation, yes,

12

the add-on for deterrence could only be understood as

13

being punitive.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, what about this case?

A

15

State decides that it wants to cut down the amount of

16

sympathy and sort of cry-baby damages the juries award, so

17

they adopt a scheme whereby in place of the old common-

18

law rule all damages for personal injury will be assessed

19

on the basis of what the reasonable person would

20

experience as damages (inaudible) pain and suffering

21

damages, that it is the claim of a reasonable person which

22

is going to be the measure of damages.

1

MR. WRIGHT:

2

Let me just note briefly, though, that there are

3

very few circumstances in which, the States have authorized

4

damages awards that we would challenge as punitive.

5

here, for instance, there is no authority that Wisconsin

6

would allow a double recovery in a situation where the

7

tort-feasor has to pay twice, and there is no Wisconsin

8

authority for damages for loss of enjoyment of life by a

9

person in a permanently comatose state.

10
11

QUESTION:

It would be left over.

And

Well, Mr. Wright, it's not really --

I don't think it's really paying twice.

12

I -- suppose, you know, the Government comes up

13

and says, we'll -- you'll sign a medical contract with us

14

and we'll give you your medical services at 80 percent of

15

cost, but you have to go to a Government hospital and take

16

our doctors.

not sure I would.

buy services where I want.

19

Now, I'm not sure you'd accept that.

What you're saying is, because you have

volunteered -- the Government has volunteered -- to

21

provide to this individual services in a Veterans

services there, whether he likes it there or not.

2

Mrs. Molzof did not intend to move Mr. Molzof, and in fact

he was cared for in the VA hospital until he died.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, in the New York regime,

5

where I take it there's no payment for loss of enjoyment

when the person becomes comatose, is that person's

7

recovery the same as in a wrongful death action, or does

8

that person get less than if there had been a wrongful

death?

19

Under a survival statute you would get any pain and

20

suffering he suffered before entering the personal

21

comatose state.

22

those sorts of awards here today.

that it's very clear that damages are noncompensatory and

2

punitive, and those circumstances are where the tort­

feasor has to pay twice, and where the tort-feasor is

required to make a payment for an inherently

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. ROTTIER

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Wright.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROTTIER:

Mr. Chief Justice and the Court,

12

there was proof at the trial level that three other

13

hospitals, including the hospital in the home town of

14

Mrs. Molzof -- Boscobel, Wisconsin -- would take this --

15

the injured veteran.

16

Moreover, the suggestion that Mrs. Molzof should

17

have taken him from the Veterans Hospital before the case

18

was tried to evidence her intent overlooks the fact the

19

cost of care is approximately $400,000 per year, and there

was testimony she had limited resources.

So that should

23

Justice Kennedy, I think under the New York regime the

25

individual versus someone who had died would be the future

1

cost of care, which obviously wouldn't be necessary.

The

2

impairment of future earning capacity would likely be the

3

same, I would expect, under the McDougald approach.
The attorney for the Government came very close

4
5

to agreeing that they were not objecting to paying the

6

money, but they were objecting to the continuation of free

7

medical care under Mr. Molzof's entitlement as a disabled

8

veteran.

9

and this is the wrong branch of Government for it.

I suggest there is a very easy solution to that,

It merely - - it can come from the Veterans

10
11

Administration; it can come from Congress.

They merely

12

suspend eligibility for the underlying benefits and

13

require the veteran to expend the dollars which have been

14

awarded at his or her choice, whether in a private

15

facility or whether in a Government facility.

16

either case they will be expended, and the purpose of the

17

act will be complied with, and that is the much cleaner

18

approach.

But in

Each time you try to focus on whether the effect

20

of receipt of compensatory damages is punitive or not, you

23

punitive damages?

Federal Tort Claims Act.
I might mention in response to Justice Souter's

2

3

questions about conscious pain and suffering and such, the

4

state of the law in Wisconsin is that conscious pain and

5

suffering is compensable, but not -- there is no such

6

entity as unconscious pain and suffering.

7

enjoyment of life is viewed as a component of pain and

8

suffering.

Loss of

The narrow issue that's undecided in Wisconsin

is whether a comatose individual who cannot exhibit an

11

awareness of loss of enjoyment of life should be

12

compensated for that component.

14

suffering.

And the court of appeals agreed with

that?

4

MR. ROTTIER:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I agree with the Government's counsel

6

that the basic approach of both the trial judge and the

7

Seventh Circuit was that both of these components of

8

damages resulted in the punitive effect and therefore was

9

prohibited by the Federal Tort Claims Act.
In closing, I would draw your attention to the

10
11

Massachusetts Bonding case which did relate to the Federal

12

Tort Claims Act and did require the Supreme Court to look

13

at the definition of punitive damages.

14

Massachusetts wrongful death statute which said that if

15

someone was killed their survivors could make a claim for

had been sought.
