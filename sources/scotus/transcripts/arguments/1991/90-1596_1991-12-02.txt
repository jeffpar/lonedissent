ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STARR:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case brings before the Court a decision by

14

The

the Spotted Owl Panel of the United States Court of
-

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declaring unconstitutional a

15

statute passed by Congress.

16

known popularly as the Northwest Timber Compromise.

17

compromise was designed to resolve ongoing controversy

18

over logging activities in various areas that serve as a

19

habitat for the northern spotted owl.

That act embodied what is
That

20

Specifically, section 318 of the Department of

21

Interior Appropriations Act set forth in quite elaborate

23

logging activity in the Pacific Northwest.

communities.

sense of urgency.

Congress' response was section 318.

In the Ninth Circuit's view, however, one

2

3

critical part of that compromise - - subsection

4

(b)(6)(A)

-- was unconstitutional.

In the Ninth Circuit's

5

view, that subsection stepped across the permissible

6

constitutional line between the Congress repealing or

7

amending a statute and going beyond and into the province

8

of article III by directing the Federal courts how to

9

decide, in this instance, two pending cases.

10

In our view, the court of appeals erred, and in

11

so doing violated one of the cardinal principles of

12

constitutional adjudication by interpreting a statute

13

needlessly so as to raise article III questions when there

14

is. an entirely plausible reading of the statute that

15

avoids the article III controversy entirely.

Well, at least not limited only to

the terms "determines" and "directs."
Now, Justice Stevens' question brings me to the

8

9

And also not limited to the plain

statute itself.

It took us 13 pages to set this out in

10

the appendix to our brief, 12-1/2, to be precise.

It is

11

complicated, but there are three basic aspects to this

12

statute.
First, it directs the Forest Service and the BLM

13
14

to offer timber sales at specified levels at -- during

15

fiscal year 1990, and it says this shall be done.

16

quite clear.

It's

25

version did not.

specific sales.
Third, and then critically for purposes of this

2

3

case, we come to (b)(6)(A).

That does two things.

4

to call the Court's attention first, lest I overlook it,

5

to the second sentence.

6

Congress says in the second sentence of (b)(6)(A) that the

7

standards that the guidelines adopted by law, by

8

subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5), shall not be subject to

9

judicial review.

I think that's critical.

I want

That's very strange.

Now, what does (b)(3) and (b)(5) do?

that that means judicial review of -- what, the

Secretary's implementation of those sections?

MR. STARR:

Yes.

Is it the Government's position

I think fairly read, given

5

Congress' intent, it means BLM's and the Forest Service's

6

administration and management of these lands consistent

7

with these guidelines.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, Mr. Starr, isn't it entirely

possible that it could be read as having Congress

10

distinguish between designation of lands for lumbering or

11

conservation and the implementation of timber sales or

12

conservation programs?

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

In other words -Yes.
It could be read, it seems to me, as

saying that the Congress has designated certain lands for

timbering.

But I think that is a plausible,

MR. STARR:

I have to concede that it is a

plausible reading, Justice O'Connor.

5

What we think, however, is critical for purposes

6

of getting at Congress' intent is that Congress wanted to

7

permit only specific challenges, and there have been

8

those, to specific sales, but it wanted to put an end to

9

the overall controversy as to whether the Forest Service

10

and the BLM had faithfully and adequately taken

11

environmental and specifically spotted owl considerations

12

into account, and it answered that.

13

It does what Congress seeks to do.

It laid down

14

a line.

15

to us quite far removed from what has vexed this Court in

16

United States v. Klein and its more recent progeny,

17

including Justice Blackmun's decision for this Court in

What Congress

seems to be saying is, we're not in the business of

deciding issues of law.

MR. STARR:

Yes, it does, and Congress,

curiously enough, does that a lot.

QUESTION:

13

MR. STARR:

It shall be deemed adequate.
Shall be deemed adequate.

As we set

14

forth in footnotes 18 and 19 of our brief, Congress when

15

it's exercising its plenary powers with respect to the

16

public lands does that all the time.

17

We have identified in footnote 18 of our brief

18

in the second paragraph 29 instances where Congress has

19

done precisely that, Justice Stevens.

20

every time it does that which ultimately the respondents

21

here are seeking to achieve.

22

Indeed, it does it

What they want, in effect, is for these public

23

lands in Oregon and the national forests in Washington to

24

be declared wilderness areas, untouchable by the human

hand. And Congress does that.

It does it on a case-by-

have no commercial economic activity.

QUESTION:

Is there any difference in Congress

MR. STARR:

I'm sorry?
That we have the latter case.
I respectfully disagree with that.

16

I do agree, Justice Kennedy, there is a distinction.

think if Congress had been trying to direct the courts to

18

enter a judgment, and they didn't.

But what Congress can do - - and that's what it
It does it all the time.

QUESTION:

General Starr, what do you think the

Klein case stands for as perhaps an irreducible minimum?
MR. STARR:

I think as an irreducible minimum,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, it stands for the proposition that

9

Congress cannot act in a way that clearly invades a

10

textually committed constitutional power, namely that of

11

the pardon power of the President, and direct the courts

12

to become parties and privy to that invasion, and that's

13

precisely what was at work in Klein.

14

Lincoln's proclamation in 1863 had said once you

15

come forward and you renounce your prior fealty to the

16

confederacy, you will in fact be forgiven, and your

17

property rights will be restored.

18

pardon which, before his death, Wilson accepted, and in

19

Kline his administrator said to this Court, look at what

20

the Reconstruction Congress is seeking to do.

21

trying to tear asunder Lincoln's exercise of his

22

Presidential power.

23

That was a part of the

decision in favor of the Government, and that's, again,

2

not -- that more modern reading of Kline is not at issue

3

here, I don't think fairly read.

4

Again, I think the Court has a choice.

5

give this statute an immensely hard reading, which is what

6

the Spotted Owl Panel chose to do -- aha, we're being

7

directed, Congress is directing us.

8

said, we're not passing on the factual and legal adequacy

9

of the two administrative documents that are under

10

challenge in the litigation.

11

QUESTION:

It can

And yet Congress

Mr. Starr, let me ask it this way.

12

Does anything in subsection (b)(3) or (b)(5) conflict with

13

the statutes under which respondents in this case brought

14

suit?

15

MR. STARR:

It is, I think from their

standpoints -- I'm going to now give you what I think

17

would be the least favorable answer to me, and that is in

It has been one of the most divisive

5

controversies in that part of the country, and Congress is

6

saying -- and if I may again call the Court's attention to

7

the statement by Senator Adams, the severity of the

8

crisis -- severity of the crisis this year did not give us

9

the luxury of time to slowly mull over this issue.

Mills

10

were shutting down, jobs were threatened and gone, our

11

State was being torn apart, and tensions were rising with

12

a real potential of violence.

13

Congress said, we don't want to get into the

14

adjudication business, but we do want to get into the

15

policy-making business, and here is the policy for fiscal

16

year 1990.

17

It has the power to do that.
QUESTION:

General Starr, the brief of Northwest

18

Forest Resource Council suggests that we really don't have

19

to get to this very difficult question of 6(A), that these

20

cases are mooted by (b)(3) and (5) alone, and we can just

look at that and then -- it makes the case a lot less

Mr. True, you would agree, would you

Yes, Your Honor, if that choice is

of the second sentence of subsection (b)(6)(A), that what

these particular areas of the forest, are off-limits to

MR. TRUE:

Well, they did make the designation,

and they did preclude judicial review of that, but the

I'm saying perhaps Congress didn't go

12

MR. TRUE:

If it didn't designate what is to

laws at issue in our cases that determine whether the

actions the agency takes on those areas of the forest meet
