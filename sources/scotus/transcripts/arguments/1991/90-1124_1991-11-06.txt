ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. MOYER, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MOYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In February of 1985 the Government made my

11
12

client, Keith Jacobson, the target of an undercover sting

13

operation known as the American Hedonist Society.

14

Government had no reason when it did that to believe that

15

Mr. Jacobson had committed a crime, was planning to commit

16

a crime, or was engaged in a course of criminal conduct.

17

The

Between February 1985 and June 1987 the

18

Government targeted Mr. Jacobson in five different and

19

separate undercover operations, the object of each of

20

which was to determine if he was receiving or trading

21

sexually explicit photos depicting children through the

22

mails.

23

1986 when Mr. Jacobson broke off correspondence with one

24

Calvin Comfort, the Government's chief witness.and a

25

postal inspector masquerading as a Carl Long, the

1

Government had even less reason to believe that Jacobson

2

was likely to commit a crime than it did when it started

3

with the American Hedonist Society more than a year

4

earlier.

5

Just the same, Jacobson was included in

6

Operation Looking Glass.

That was sting number 5 in March

7

of 1 87, and was finally, after 28 months of Government

8

effort, induced to receive a single magazine depicting a
child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
I contend that Mr. Jacobspn was entrapped as a

10
11

matter of law.

12

predisposition to commit the crime charged in the

13

indictment, to engage in criminal conduct, does not appear

before Government agents target him.

been up to the jury that there was entrapment as a matter

8

of law?
MR. MOYER:

There was entrapment as a matter of

10

law, and I say that the jury verdict in this case, Your

11

Honor, is fatally flawed because the Government was

12

permitted to offer to the jury evidence that Mr. Jacobson

13

suffered from a weakness, that he had a sexual desire to

look at pictures, sexually explicit pictures of boys, and

that he was a homosexual.

that the predisposition of the defendant must appear

before he begins to interact with the Government agents,

before they contact him, before anything at all is done.

Is that what the instructions said to

MR. MOYER:

10

No, I don't think it is.
Well, what did, was there an

charge, Your Honor, and there were instructions offered.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MOYER:

About entrapment?
That's right.

There was an

13

objection to the jury charge on entrapment and there were

14

instructions offered which would define predisposition and

15

also which would define inducement, and the trial court

16

did not give those instructions.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Moyer, do you take the

18

position that the Government must always prove

19

predisposition in these entrapment cases by establishing

20

events that occurred before the Government started its

21

sting operation?

MR. MOYER:

then, as requiring reasonable suspicion or reasonable

2

grounds to believe that this particular individual is

3

suspect?

5

MR. MOYER:

intend to argue that as I proceed with my - QUESTION:

6

7

Yes, Your Honor, that is, and I

We didn't grant certiorari on that

question, I guess.
MR. MOYER:

8

The question was, upon which you

granted certiorari, Justice O'Connor, was whether or not
10

he was entrapped as a matter of law.
QUESTION:

11

And --

As a matter of law.

You think that

12

incorporates your first question as presented on

13

certiorari?

14

MR. MOYER:

Well, the question was, was he

15

entrapped as a matter of law where he does not meet the

16

attorney general's guidelines for inclusion in an

17

undercover operation and where he does not meet the

18

guidelines established by the Postal Service for inclusion

1

in the operation.
QUESTION:

20

If you're correct in your position

21

that the events have to have occurred before the

22

Government sting operation, then I suppose some of these

23

sting operation pawn shops and so forth that are set up in

24

various communities are operating illegally, then, in your

25

view?

1

MR. MOYER:

Not in my view, Your Honor, and I

2

think that that situation can be readily distinguished

3

from the situation where the Government goes out, finds a

4

suspect on a list somewhere, out of the telephone book

5

actually if the Eighth Circuit's opinion is to be

6

followed, and the situation in which the Government so

7

structures the undercover operation that it is reasonably

8

clear that persons who are drawn to the operation are

9

predisposed to commit the crime.

10

QUESTION:

For instance --

Well, wait, how did they get

11

him -- they got his name, as I understand it, because of

12

his purchase of material which would not have been illegal

13

at the time he originally purchased it, but which would

14

have been illegal after this act was passed that made --

The petitioner does not concede -You don't concede that, but that's

the Government's contention.
MR. MOYER:

That's the Government's contention,

that's correct.
QUESTION:

These, what is it, Bare Boys I and

21

Bare Boys II books that purported to be just books about

22

nudist colonies.

MR. MOYER:

they were described.

Would you then concede that there was

MR. MOYER:

No, Mr. Justice, I would not, for

this reason - QUESTION:

Even though the Government would then

know he had an appetite for what was, what was illegal?
MR. MOYER:

If I may answer your question by an

9

analogy, suppose the Government in the interest of the

10

health of all of us in the United States, particularly

11

those like me who have asthma, banned smoking completely.

12

Now then, would the Government then be permitted under an

13

undercover operation to find the list of Philip Morris

14

customers and offer Philip Morris cigarettes to these

15

customers in a plain brown wrapper?

16

QUESTION:

Well, I think there's a little

17

difference between what you might call a malum prohibitum

18

and a malum in se.

19

be cigarettes, but perhaps cocaine.

20

originally not illegal and then made illegal, you think

21

the Government could not target people who were known

22

prior users of cocaine?

MR. MOYER:

I don't think the proper analog would
If that were

Well, I think this was a malum

25

least that's the way the district court regarded it.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. MOYER:

Urn-hum.
What you're doing there is offering

3

me an example that involves a pernicious substance, and

4

indeed I don't disagree that child pornography is subject

5

to Government control.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MOYER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MOYER:

10

That isn't my point.

But you don't think it's pernicious?
Excuse me?
But you don't think it's pernicious?
Child pornography can be pernicious,

yes, sir, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

But not -- only after it's outlawed?

12

MR. MOYER:

If Your Honor please, my point is

13

that you cannot assume that somebody is going to engage in

14

criminal activity, knowing that it's criminal, just

15

because he has engaged in that activity when it was legal.

16

And the - -

17

QUESTION:

It depends on what the activity is.

18

If it's that kind of an activity, just as if it would have

19

been cocaine, I think one may, one may suspect this is a

20

person who does not care that much about societal norms.

21

You don't think that's a reasonable suspicion?

22

MR. MOYER:

If Your Honor please, the substance

23

was not illegal for him to obtain, or that is to say the

24

books were not illegal for him to obtain.

25

asking me to assume that these books meet the test of the

Now you're

explicit conduct.

whether they do or not - -

Nevertheless and irrespective of

I don't want you to concede that.

We're assuming that for purposes.
MR. MOYER:

Yeah, for the purposes of the

7

hypothetical.

been a crime to receive this type of material through the

9

mail, and under the decisions of this Court in Stanley it

Nevertheless, it was not and it had never

was not a crime to possess it and the State of Nebraska,

11

it had not adopted a statute making it illegal to possess

12

child pornography until well after this case was tried in

13

the district court for the District of Nebraska in Omaha.

14

So therefore the Government has to assume from

15

the fact that Mr. Jacobson did something that the

16

Government has to concede, indeed stipulate, did not

17

violate the law, that he will violate the law later.

18

then after they made that assumption and they targeted him

19

for these undercover operations they offered him

20

opportunities to purchase child pornography, and there is

21

nothing in the evidence or in the record that indicates

22

that he ever did that.

23

QUESTION:

And

It seems to me you are requiring more

24

than mere suspicion that he is the type of person who

25

would violate the law.

You require that they know that he

1

had violated the law before.

2

MR. MOYER:

3

QUESTION:

4

Is that

That he - - I - - I am sorry.
Is that what you require, that they

have to suspect that he has violated the law before?

5

MR. MOYER:

I don't think that the guidelines

6

that were adopted by the attorney general quite go that

7

far.

8

that there has to be a reasonable indication based on

9

information developed through informants or other means

I think subparagraph (a) of those guidelines say

10

that the subject is engaging, has engaged, or is likely to

11

engage in illegal activity of a similar type.

12

that is the rule that Judge Heaney was trying to arrive at

13

when he required a reasonable suspicion based upon an

14

articuable fact in his panel opinion.

15

QUESTION:

And I think

Well, here it was activity of a

16

similar type, if we accept the hypothesis, but it was not

17

yet illegal, and you say that makes the difference?

18

MR. MOYER:

That makes the difference, that the

19

Government is assuming that he will break the law.

20

then, Your Honors, the Government --

21

22

23

QUESTION:

And

Do you have authority for that

proposition?
MR. MOYER:

If Your Honor please, I think that

24

the early cases that we cite in our brief all say that

25

before anything at all is done with respect to the

2

the Devitt and Blackmar instruction, the standard

3

instruction on entrapment, has stated that same language,

4

and that instruction has been given and given and given

5

and approved repeatedly by numerous of the circuits.
QUESTION:

6

Furthermore

What, what's an example of one of the

7

early cases that you just referred to in your answer to

8

Justice Kennedy?

9
10

MR. MOYER:

May I answer that, Your Honor, by

referring to footnote 3 on page 26 of the brief?

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MOYER:

Your brief?
Yes, Your Honor.

In which we point

13

out, there is a strip cite there, of numerous cases in

14

Those are not from this Court, Your

QUESTION:

20

QUESTION:

But your point is the Government

21

should have some, some kind of a suspicion that he, that

the target is likely to break the law by a certain course

23

of conduct?

24

MR. MOYER:

25

That's correct.
It isn't that he was likely -- that

MR. MOYER:

And we argued that the jury should

have been instructed that he had to receive, knowingly

never determined that issue.

that ignorance of the law is no excuse, which tends to be

the rule.

Government - - why does the Government have to show that

this is a person who not only acquired child pornography

before, but also acquired it before knowing it was in

since in order to convict you don't have to prove that he

knew it was in violation of the law?

Suppose we agree with them.

Then the

Why does it have to prove that

All you have to

prove is that he received child pornography.
MR. MOYER:

Because you run the danger of

MR. MOYER:

I don't mean to suggest that the

At that juncture the Government itself

I think even more significantly, however, was

the American Hedonist Society undercover operation.

Hedonist Society had a letter called, The Little Light, a

So by the time they get down here to this last

And if he got eight newsletters, which

would be approximately the right number, between the time

that he was enrolled in the Looking Glass survey and the

time that he was enrolled in the Looking Glass sting and

that he was not trading child pornography with other

he had not been breaking the law and was not breaking the

MR. LARKIN:

I suppose, on that point.
Yeah.
Because normally what you have is a

situation where someone is engaged in a course of conduct

whether this person committed the crime because the

criminal design was implanted in his head by the

Government or committed the crime of his own free will.

9

Now, in this case we think the evidence shows without a

doubt that he was predisposed, that a reasonable jury

could find that he was predisposed.

he was predisposed.

MR. LARKIN:

That'S right.

Most cases where you have a

doesn't know he is violating the law you don't even get to

Right.

MR. LARKIN:

-- the way it's described.

You

And when was that?
That was in, I think, March of

1987.
QUESTION:

Well, so there must be, there must be

10

some evidence -- I guess the judge has to be convinced

11

that there's enough evidence to show a predisposition

12

prior to the first contact, but that evidence doesn't have

13

to be evidence of facts or conduct prior to the contact?

14

MR. LARKIN:

15

QUESTION:

Correct.

Correct.

And it -- well, that answers it.

16

other words the Government doesn't have to know of that

17

evidence at the time that it makes the contact?

18

MR. LARKIN:

19

QUESTION:

In

Correct.
I thought you said you were, you

20

didn't concede that there has to be evidence of

21

predisposition before the first contact.

22

said you were willing to take that on but you don't really

23

think that's essential.

24

MR. LARKIN:

25

QUESTION:

I thought you

It's certainly not essential.
What do you do about the pawn shop?

The Government sets up a pawn shop and I see the pawn

shop, I have no predisposition.

3

it, gee, there's a pawn shop.

4

there, they don't know whether it's mine or not.

5

and so I thereafter conceive the idea of stealing

6

something and bringing it to the pawn shop.

MR. LARKIN:

QUESTION:

I get to thinking about
I can take anything in
And I,

I don't think -Are you saying that that, that I have

been entrapped now because I did not have the
10
11

predisposition when I first -MR. LARKIN:

No, no.

The evidence can be

12

acquired at a later point, it's just that it has to refer

13

back to that earlier point.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Justice

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, excuse

To return to the question you asked me, Mr.

5

Chief Justice, I would call the Court's attention also to

6

page 13 of our reply brief in which we quote from Mr.

7

Justice Roberts' concurring opinion in Sorrells v. United

8

States where he says that it has been generally held where

9

the defendant has proved an entrapment it is permissible

10

to show in rebuttal that the officer guilty of incitement

11

of the crime had reasonable cause to believe the defendant

12

was a person disposed to commit the offense.

13

procedure is approved by the majority opinion of this

14

Court.

15

QUESTION:

This

Well, most of Mr. Justice Roberts'

16

opinion was not approved by the majority in Sorrells.

17

again in Sherman the Court was asked to adopt his

18

concurring opinion in Sorrells and it refused to do that.

19

MR. MOYER:

And

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

20

don't cite the concurring opinion for that proposition.

21

cite it for the proposition that Mr. Justice Roberts there

22

mentions that the majority opinion in Sorrells recognizes

23

that the practice had been, at that time, at the time

24

Sorrells was decided, and I think your question went to

25

whether or not I had any authority from this Court, that

the officer guilty of incitement of the crime had

reasonable cause to believe the defendant was a person

5

is the point that I wish to make.
QUESTION:

6

And that

Mr. Moyer, I've been thinking, if we

7

adopted that proposition that you are urging on us, that

8

it's unlawful for the Government to approach a person
unless the Government knows in advance of approaching him

10

that he has the predisposition, then I guess the

11

Government couldn't put an ad in a magazine, you know,

12

that suggested that it has child pornography for sale.

13

Right?

14

including people that don't have the predisposition, and

15

any conviction derived from that would be invalid.

16

that right?

17

Because that ad would get to all sorts of people,

Justice Scalia, I think you have to

18

distinguish between the subparagraph (a) sting that the

Attorney General describes in his guidelines and the

column (b) sting, or subparagraph (b) sting.

ad is of the (b) sting variety and the pawn shop is of the

so that there is a reason for believing that those drawn

to the opportunity are predisposed to commit it.

I don't see a whole lot of difference

Honor, it's clear that Mr. Jacobson was the target of a
