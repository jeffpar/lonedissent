ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD J. O'DONNELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. O'DONNELL:

8
9

Good afternoon, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case presents a very narrow issue; may

10
11

States equate speech or association entitled to protection

12

under the First Amendment with character evidence, and

13

thereby enhance a criminal sentence, particularly so as to

14

impose a sentence of death, when those beliefs are

15

unrelated to the offense.
As Delaware concedes in its brief, the

16
17

petitioner, David Dawson, invokes two traditional First

18

Amendment precepts.

19

never be imposed nor aggravated because of an individual's

20

beliefs; and secondly, that Government, here in the form

21

of the sentencing jury, must always remain value or

22

content neutral within the realm of a person's beliefs or

23

views.

24
25

First, that criminal penalties can

1

aggravating circumstance, it instead argues the radical

2

proposition that the traditional First Amendment

3

constraints against governmental-viewpoint punishment are

4

not applicable to the highly-discretionary, weighing stage

5

of a death penalty proceeding in order to determine

6

whether a particular — particular defendant should live

7

or die.

8

9

This Court, however, has made it clear that
States, in inflicting punishment — particularly in

10

inflicting the penalty of death — may not attach the

11

aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally

12

impermissible.

13

Delaware has done just that in this case.

14

QUESTION:

Well, why do you say particularly

15

with respect to the punishment of death?

16

that if your proposition is correct, it would have to be

17

correct with respect to any sentencing.

18

First Amendment violation, you wouldn't say that you can,

19

you know, that it's good for other punishments, for life

20

imprisonment, for example?

21

MR. O'DONNELL:

I mean I assume

I mean, if it's a

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

The passage, however, I was referring to is the Court's

23

principle as stated in Zant v. Stevens, which was a death

24

penalty case.

25

QUESTION:

You're not relying on death as

different here?

You're

MR. O'DONNELL:

No, sir, not with respect to

this claim.
QUESTION:

Question presented, Mr. O'Donnell,

5

has the qualification that the murder here had no racial

6

motivations or connections.

7

that if the murder did have racial connections or

8

motivations the State couldn't have used this evidence?

9

MR. O'DONNELL:

You're not arguing, then,

Under that circumstance, Chief

10

Justice Rehnquist, the State could use that as an

11

aggravating factor.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

So that's one limitation, isn't it,

on your very broad proposition?
MR. O'DONNELL:

Yes, it is.

There is a

15

broad — the petitioner is stating a broad proposition.

16

However, there are narrow circumstances which this Court

17

has recognized where limited use of a belief or

18

association may be used in order to determine whether the

19

penalty of death or life imprisonment is appropriate.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. O'DONNELL:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

(inaudible)
Yes, Justice White.

Is it simply a First Amendment

argument you're making?
Suppose, for instance, that we were to conclude
that character, associations, beliefs, are relevant to a

1

whole range of sentencing issues.

2

particular reference might be unduly prejudicial.

3

you preserved a due process argument?

4

First Amendment inquiry that we're making?
MR. O'DONNELL:

5

But that this
Have

Or is it simply a

It is a First Amendment inquiry,

6

Your Honor.

However, subsumed within that, or, more or

7

less the overarching consideration is — but more

8

particularly subsumed within that claim is the due process

9

claim simply because it would be unfair to say to

10

individuals within our society who are protected by — say

11

the First Amendment — to say to them that, well,

12

you — the Government may not abridge freedom of speech.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. O'DONNELL:

15

QUESTION:

20

Would you disagree with the comment

that this is simply a question of relevance?
MR. O'DONNELL:

18
19

It says, however, you're going

to be punished in this instance.

16
17

Would you —

It is not simply a question of

relevance.
Evidence which is arguably relevant may

21

nonetheless be barred by some constitutional prohibition.

22

I would offer the Court as an example an instance in

23

perhaps a — in a capital proceeding where the defendant

24

had asserted his right to remain silent, had asserted his

25

Fifth Amendment right to remain silent throughout the

trial, as in throughout the penalty proceeding.
Although lack of remorse is a criteria, is a
relevant criteria for determining whether a person should
live or die, if the State, nonetheless, argued to the jury
under those circumstances that an additional reason, or
the very reason you should put this man to death is
because you have not heard him apologize to you or anyone
else — although the lack of remorse is’relevant,
*

nonetheless, that would be barred under the Fifth
Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, the Fifth Amendment is in large

part a procedural safeguard at trial, for a systemic
reason.

But your answer to the Chief Justice's question

seems to me to indicate that this is just a question of
relevance.
In the hypothetical he put to you, yes, the
evidence is relevant, it comes in.
MR. O'DONNELL:
can reflect on character.

It can — all sorts of evidence
But then nonetheless, in any

circumstance, where a person's beliefs are used to impose
punishment, that is — that is prohibited by the First
Amendment.
And there are only certain limited circumstances
in which any evidence can come into evidence, and only
then for limited purposes.

And, in fact, in some of those instances, the

1
2

trial courts or this Court has recognized that the trial

3

courts have, in fact, instructed juries as to that limited

4

purpose.
QUESTION:

5

Well, what about a sentencing

6

proceeding in a noncapital case where you deal with a

7

probation interview, and there are probation officers

8

interviewing?

9

not yet sentenced says — and the probation officer says,

The defendant who has been convicted, but

10

are you sorry for having done this?

11

not sorry.

12

killed, and that's the way I feel about it.

13

any remorse at all.

14
15
16

And he says, no, I'm

I -- I believe the guy should have been
I don't have

Now that, presumably, is a belief he has.
surely that could be taken into consideration.
MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, under those circumstances,

17

Your Honor, it's not — there'd be no First Amendment

18

protection that would be relevant that determines his

19

propensity as to future conduct.

20
21
22

But

QUESTION:

Well, it's his particular belief that

this guy should have been killed.
MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, under those circumstances,

23

it would be relevant, because his belief took that belief

24

out of the context of First Amendment protection, because

25

the belief resulted in unlawful action, or a crime.

2

QUESTION:

So it's like your exception for a

racially motivated crime, and in this case?

3

MR. O'DONNELL:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, very much so.

Well, what about — what about in the

5

probation report it — or in any sentencing proceeding,

6

evidence is brought in to the effect that this individual

7

was a really terrible son?

8

never heard from him.

9

things of that sort.

His mother, you know, has

She's living in poverty, you know,

10

Can that be in there?

11

MR. O'DONNELL:

12

13

Yes, Your Honor, it could.

Because there's no —
QUESTION:

All right, but what if it said

14

he — he believes that mothers should be — should be

15

disregarded and allowed to live in poverty?

16

disregarded?

17

MR. O'DONNELL:

18

QUESTION:

That must be

If he has a belief —

I mean, if the one is relevant to

19

what sentence he should get, it seems to me the other is

20

relevant to what sentence he should get.

21

MR. O'DONNELL:

22

QUESTION:

If it's —

I mean, the fact that he left his

23

mother to live in poverty is only important because it

24

shows that he's the kind of a guy who believes it's okay

25

to leave your mother to live in poverty.

But if he says

1

that directly, we can't use it.

2

That doesn't seem to make sense to me.

MR. O'DONNELL:

It does make sense in the sense

he's not being punished for his belief.

evidence which he might offered.
QUESTION:

It's merely being

No, that's not at all.

MR. O'DONNELL:

Under those

circumstances — because it's not an abstract idea, it's

not — it's an abstraction.

15

with others.

as an abstract idea, because he endorses or embraces that

17

abstract idea.

It's punishable, for that reason, too — not

It's because he has not — he has not

If that is, in fact, so, if he has not offered
his mother any support, he has been unkind to her —

QUESTION:

22

MR. O'DONNELL:

23

It has nothing to do

Right.
— it's perfectly — it's

pertinent to character.

QUESTION:

That shows his character?

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, were it -- were it --

That does not show his character?
Were it related to the offense

itself, somehow, if there were — if there were a

8

violation of some obligation, if it was the death of his

child, or his stepchild, or wherever — whatever, it would

provide some insight into his state of mind with respect

4

QUESTION:

Well, does this case really involve

5

something about beliefs?

in a certain gang.

7

MR. O'DONNELL:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. O'DONNELL:

I thought it was just membership

Yes, it is about beliefs.

What?
It is about beliefs, because the

10

evidence concerned his racist beliefs.

11

asked —

12

QUESTION:

And arguably, it's

And the jury was

I thought it was just — it was just

13

that he was a member of a — of a prison gang that was

14

racist.

Isn't that all it was?

MR. O'DONNELL:

An association is not

punishable, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, I'd hope so, but it

18

isn't — but this isn't technically beliefs.

19

any evidence about what the gang's beliefs were, except

20

for being racial.

21

MR. O'DONNELL:
that.

There was no evidence besides

And that —

QUESTION:

3

QUESTION:

And there was no evidence about what

his connection with the gang was, other than membership?
MR. O'DONNELL:

That is — that is correct.

4

that the gang embraced what most people in society

5

consider abhorrent beliefs, unpopular beliefs.

6

And that was used as the criteria —

7

QUESTION:

8
9

And

Well, associational rights aren't

impervious too, are they?
MR. O'DONNELL:

No, sir, they are not, if the

10

association — if through the association it's evident

11

that the — the person is inciting or attempting to

12

provoke unlawful action as a result of that association,

13

that — that is not impermeable.

14

QUESTION:

So you're --

15

QUESTION:

There was a long colloquy between the

)

16

prosecutor and the defendant before the — was it the

17

Superior Court judge before whom this case was tried?

18

MR. O'DONNELL:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

As to just what — what should come

20

in about this membership.

21

in was not nearly as much, as I read it, as the State said

22

they could prove.

23

And what the judge actually let

Is that your impression too?

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, with respect to that, all

24

the State was willing to prove, in addition — and they

25

were satisfied with what they did prove, but what they

offered, or proffered, rather, is evidence of other

2

persons' beliefs or gangs in other States.

3

it was not pertinent to this defendant's.

4

6

QUESTION:

Nonetheless,

Yeah, that never -- and that never

went to the jury here.
MR. O'DONNELL:

It never went to the jury.

And

7

that, in and of itself, would have been — would have been

8

constitutionally impermissible.

9

QUESTION:

So what went to the jury was

10

basically if they — saying they could take into

11

consideration his membership in this organization which

12

had a particular belief, but which was not characterized

13

as advocating any particular action.

14

MR. 0'D0NN,ELL:

Is that true?

It was not characterized as

15

advocating any particular action.

16

characterized as advocating any particular unlawful

17

action, it would be --

18

QUESTION:

If, in fact, it was

Well, how likely has the unlawful

19

action got to be?

20

clear and present danger test, are you?

21

is — if, in this — in a capital case, if he is not

22

sentenced to death that he will engage in this behavior?

23

I mean you're not proposing a kind of
That if he

Are you arguing simply that the belief indicates

24

a propensity — the statement of belief indicates a

25

propensity to engage in this kind of behavior?

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Is that

1

enough?
MR. O'DONNELL:

2

A propensity is not enough, Your

3

Honor.

It must be shown, or there must be a foundation

4

for distinguishing -- distinguishing between the belief in

5

abstract doctrine and the advocacy of unlawful action.

6

QUESTION:

Yeah, well what is — what is the

7

line-drawing criterion?

8

you want us to hold.

9

encapsulates that?

That's — in effect, that's what

How would we write the sentence that

MR. O'DONNELL:

10

Based on decisions by the Court

11

in, for instance, Yates and, and Noto, it would be along

12

the lines to the effect where the belief, or where there

13

is advocacy of unlawful action, is based on these facts.

14

There it takes it out of the realm of protection by the

15

First Amendment.
QUESTION:

16

So there's, again — I think you're

17

saying that there need not be, in order to make the belief

18

evidence admissible, there need not be any particular

19

degree of probability

20

be — form the basis for later action,\ but merely a

21

possibility that it form a motive for later action.

22

that true?

that that belief would, in fact,

23

MR. O'DONNELL:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. O'DONNELL:

Is

That —

Is that what you're saying?
That is true.

And under the

1

circumstances

2

QUESTION:

Then why doesn't any belief qualify?

3

MR. O'DONNELL:

Any belief would qualify for

4

protection, so long as it is advocacy of an abstract

5

doctrine and does not incite or there's no attempt to

6

incite unlawful action, or provoke it.

7

QUESTION:

No, but you're not — I don't think

8

you're saying that the kind of relevant and admissible

9

belief evidence must consist of statements of incitement.
You're saying, somehow, that they must consist

10
11

of statements which, if they were followed by the

12

defendant, would entail unlawful conduct.

13

isn't it?

14
15

MR. O'DONNELL:

That is true.

That's true,

If this

defendant —

16

QUESTION:

Well, there's no incitement.

I mean

17

we're not talking about statements of incitement.

18

simply talking about statements of belief.

19

the criterion for judging between some statements of

20

belief which may be considered, and others which may not

21

be?

22

Two possibilities come to mind.

We're

And what is

One is, there

23

must be some high — some degree of probability that he

24

will actually act on the statement.

25

said that's not your criterion.

And I think you've

The other possibility is that the statement must

1

2

be -- must somehow relate to unlawful conduct which is

3

identical to or close to the conduct for which he is being

4

punished in this case.
MR. O'DONNELL:

5

Would that be your criterion?
That would be the criteria, so

6

long as there is advocacy to commit unlawful action.

7

it was simply an abstract doctrine — and I point out —
QUESTION:

8

If

So if you're centering -- if you're

9

sentencing then, a burglar, a high degree of probability

10

based even on advocacy, even on statements of advocacy of

MR. O'DONNELL:

12

Under those circumstances it

13

would not be.

14

he had advocated the death of a witness against him within

the prison, he had solicited a crime, unquestionably.

That advocacy would be outside the scope of any arguable

Yes, sir — yes, sir.

Well, then aren't you saying that

behavior is noncriminal, it's got to satisfy some further

it's got to satisfy a different relevance test?

MR. O'DONNELL:

If it is simply -- merely

And that's protected under the First

11

Even if you limit it that way,

though, you're really not describing a doctrine that

MR. O'DONNELL:

QUESTION:

MR. O'DONNELL:

That's correct.

You could do that.
To the extent that I suggested

6

that advocacy didn't intend that those ends be

accomplished, and they were likely to be accomplished, I

8

may have misspoke.
There has to be some — we must cross the line

of just advocacy of an abstract doctrine to take it

outside the First — the realm of First Amendment

QUESTION:

13

Mr. O'Donnell, I wonder if your case

shouldn't be aimed more at membership rather than

advocacy?
Let me read to you the stipulation which, I

understand, is what went to the jury in this case.

I think you may be biting off more than you need to
when you get into all of this about advocacy.
MR. O'DONNELL:

4

That is, in fact,

5

correct -- that in this case we are dealing with

9

MR. O'DONNELL:

He did, Your Honor.

Your Honor, as the Court pointed

5

out in Lanzetta v. New Jersey, some years ago — in fact,

6

it was 1928 -- in that case, one of the elements of the

offense was that the petitioner be a member of a gang, or

a gangster; in fact, that's how the crime was defined.

Some of the other elements were that he not have a job,

There's no question in this case that his

QUESTION:

What -- and you would permit that?

MR. FAIRBANKS:

I think that that -- membership

consideration when he considers all the aggravating and

different from the hypothetical Justice Stevens put to you

MR. FAIRBANKS:

has said in the context of death penalty — penalty

hearings, is that what that jury is supposed to do is to

14

render a moral judgment based upon the character and

propensities of the defendant and the circumstances of the

offense.

defendant at the sentencing hearing can show that he went

MR. FAIRBANKS:

that's -- and that ultimately is what his -- his final

position, as articulated in his reply brief is.

in mitigation, the State can present associational beliefs

So I take it, under some

circumstances, you would say the State would be entitled

to put in evidence that although he belongs to the Boy

that — I'm not sure what — what, from the — from the

Well, supposing the defendant doesn't

that — the State thinks that in this — in this

very unpopular with the jury.

Well, I think that is what

occurs, and may very well occur in death penalty cases up

characteristics that the defendant puts in which are not

I mean, he may say —

So if you're going to keep out the

That is -- that connects to the

Because neither of those goals had

17

he really is, why don't you put in evidence of what he did

18

in prison, instead of what organization he belonged to?

19

MR. FAIRBANKS:

Because the organization — just

20

like his joining AA, his going to AA meetings — I mean he

21

has a right to say that, not because he's proven that he

22

has actually been rehabilitated, but that he goes to those

23

meetings as offer — as an offer to show that he is making

24

attempts at rehabilitation.

This is the counter of that evidence.

MR. FAIRBANKS:

That's the

saying is if you cannot punish it as — if you can't

criminalize it you can't — or regulate against it, is why

8

you can't consider it when you talk about his character.

9

And we simply say that you can.
It's much like remorse or the lack of remorse.

10
11

One can demonstrate lack of remorse not simply by not

testifying, but actively by saying something, or by making

a gesture.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD J. O'DONNELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. O'DONNELL:

First, if I may, allow me to respond to the

State's points concerning this being rebuttal evidence.
This is not rebuttal evidence which we're

8

talking about.

9

the defendant proffered, what the petitioner proffered.

10

The State suggests that it counters what

The State used a very inept example.

The

11

pointed out that the defendant asked the court to

12

consider, asked the jury to consider as an example his

13

alcoholism.

14

concerning his racism countered or rebutted that

mitigating evidence.

16

Now the State suggests that somehow evidence

If Delaware or Mr. Fairbanks knows of a rational

17

relationship between alcoholism and racism, or any other

18

ism in this country, they should share that finding with

the Surgeon General, as well as with Delaware juries.

QUESTION:

As I understand you on your direct

argument that you thought that if there was — if the

judge — if there was evidence offered about the — what

23

this group was all about, that it really — it really was

a — a criminal enterprise, and did incite escapes, would

Well, unless he adopted and

advocated the escapes.

3

And I might point out that --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. O'DONNELL:

Well, now, say that again?
Unless he advocated, or if part

6

of it was that he was engaged in a conspiracy to commit

7

the escapes --

8

QUESTION:

All the — all that was offered was

9

that he's a member of this group, and this group believes

10

and is actively engaged in the — in criminal activities.
Now, is that evidence admissible?

11
12

Is his

membership in that kind of a group —
MR. O'DONNELL:

13

No, no it is not.

Because

14

there's no evidence that he intended to accomplish those

15

ends.

16

The State, I may point out, introduced evidence

17

in this case that he escaped.

18

QUESTION:

So you have to really — you have to

really show that he participated in these criminal

activities?

You say

1

that in order to get the evidence in, you would have to

show that he participated in these criminal activities?

QUESTION:

Mr. O'Donnell, you introduced

evidence of group membership, right — AA — now, I guess

7

if you say that a person can't be sentenced on the basis

9

he shouldn't be sentenced because of his nonmembership

10

either.
But doesn't that happen every time somebody who

11

12

doesn't belong to AA is sentenced?

I mean your client can

13

come in and say I'm a member of AA.

is being punished because he's a nonmember of AA.
