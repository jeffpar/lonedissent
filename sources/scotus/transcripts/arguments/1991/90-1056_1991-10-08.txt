ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. BURSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BURSON:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents facial challenge to a’

Tennessee law which prohibits on election day campaigning

within 100 feet to the entrance of the polling place.

serves the purposes which justify it.

3

Laws similar to Tennessee have been outstanding

4

over this country for the past century.

5

effectively served their purpose.
QUESTION:

7

How many States have such laws?

MR. BURSON:

47 States have such laws.

The

distances run from 25 feet to the maximum -- Hawaii has

10

1,000 feet.

11

200 feet.

12

like 17 to 18 of the States have 100 feet.

13

And

do most of them provide for a 100-foot limit or what?

They have

Most of them range between 50 feet and
100 feet is fairly typical.

QUESTION:

I think something

General, when you say the States have

14

such laws, do you mean they have laws regulating conduct

15

not only in the polling place itself under the roof, but

16

laws regulating areas outside?

17

outside the polling place?

18

MR. BURSON:

Are there 47 that regulate

47 regulate outside of the polling

19

place; 3 other States have laws that regulate, but only in

20

the polling place.

21

22

23

That's only three States.

QUESTION:

General Burson, what are the purposes

of those laws as you see them and in your State?
MR. BURSON:

Well, political campaigns are

24

emotionally charged events.

in the proper context.

And I think we have to put it

I'm under the impression - - as a

prohibiting political advertising on election day in

17

Does Tennessee have such a law?

MR. BURSON:

They may so do -- no, our -- on

Tennessee in the morning, particular.

We certainly would say that it is.

How do we judge content neutrality?

By looking at the purpose for which the statute is passed?

MR. BURSON:

Well, I think you look to see

whether the regulation is only justified with reference to

QUESTION:

Well, what about cases from this

7

Court, such as Kerry and Mosley, where the Court has said

8

that a State can't regulate some but not all potentially

9

disruptive expression?

10

MR. BURSON:

I think what this Court, in looking

11

and Mosley and Kerry, what those -- where the legislature

12

specifically exempted a labor picketing, and what the

13

Court seemed to say was look, we can't see any difference

14

between labor picketing and other type of picketing.

15

They'll both have the same type of effect.

16

Court, it seems to me concluded was, that the statute was

17

directed at a particular type of expression because of the

18

content of that expression, and that's labor picketing.

19

We just don't have this.

So what the

I can't -- the failure

20

to include a hot dog vendor or a book salesman or a Hari

21

Krishna booth just has never been a problem in relation to

22

elections.

23

There is -- excuse me.
QUESTION:

haven't they, General, that the legislature can deal with

1

way if it doesn't find the evil going beyond a certain

2

point.

3

MR. BURSON:

Absolutely.

That's absolutely

4

correct.

5

the Hari Krishna groups become a problem, then the

6

legislature could legislate to guard these same interests.

7

But that's exactly right.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

And if hot dog vendors become a problem and if

If they became a problem and this

statute remained on the book, would there then be an
argument that the statute is no longer content neutral?
MR. BURSON:

11

Well, certainly it would have been

12

content neutral as passed, and in terms of the motivation.

13

Now to preserve it, would that mean that it would become

14

unconstitutional at that point in time?

15

point in time it would begin to raise a question as to

16

whether this was intended actually to serve those

17

purposes.

18

standard that the Court has to look at in making that

19

content-neutral determination.

20

I think at that

I think that's what the Court -- that's the

Does the statute serve the purposes which it

21

says justified, or does the regulation serve those

22

purposes, and are those purposes related to the content of

23

the speech.

24

you might begin to raise the -- raise a question about

25

what the real purpose of the statute was.

And if you took your hypothetical far enough,

But that

doesn't exist here.

2

QUESTION:

General Burson, the regulation here

3

would extend in some areas to public streets and public

4

sidewalks, if they were within the 100-foot limit.

5

that true?
MR. BURSON:

6

7

Yes, there may be a portion of a

sidewalk that would be encompassed within the 100 feet.

8

QUESTION:

MR. BURSON:

10

And a street?
And some of them may even extend

into a street.
QUESTION:

11

Does that affect the constitutional

12

analysis at all, do you think, where it's a traditional

13

public forum that's affected?

14

MR. BURSON:

We don't think that it affects the

15

outcome.

Depending upon how you interpret this election

16

zone as a public forum or not, even where it crosses a

17

traditional public fora, you might have -- if it's a

18

public fora, we would suggest the time, place, or manner

19

restriction.

20

apply the balancing test that it applies when election

21

laws are contested.

We would -- express that the Court basically

22

And further, we think there's an argument,

Justice O'Connor, that even where on this 1 day both

private and public places are taken over by the

Government, taken control of and administered by the

Government for this one purpose, that an argument could be

2

fashioned and is very credible that even where it hits a

3

sidewalk, that that, in fact, is a nonpublic fora.

4

QUESTION:

Suppose if the town can give a group

a parade permit that in effect preempts 10 blocks of a

MR. BURSON:

Yes.

I think that is one of the

12

things we are suggesting.

where the area of both the sidewalks and the street are

14

roped off --

15

QUESTION:

Just if you have a street fair

And I suppose if this statute is

I suppose that so would a statute which prevents

electioneering inside the voting booth itself.

QUESTION:

MR. BURSON:

And no other activities.
Or within 25 feet.
25 feet, Your Honor, we would

22

suggest is purely a difference of degree, and not in kind.

23

And if 25 feet is okay, 100 feet is okay.

24
25

QUESTION:

Does the statute permit 300 foot

limits in certain counties?

MR. BURSON:

1

No, the statute has a provision in

2

it for 300-feet limit.

3

issued and opinion basically based upon State

4

constitutional grounds that said the population

5

classifications as to that 300-foot limit were not

6

rational, and under specific provision of our State

7

constitution, it would not stand.
QUESTION:

8

9

That is not operative.

Our office

Does your statute permit official

poll watchers to - - within 100 feet?
MR. BURSON:

10

The statute actually allows poll

11

watchers inside the polling place.

12

one per candidate, and two per political party.

13

that's very closely regulated in terms of --

14

QUESTION:

It allows, I think,
But

Would your argument allow a State to

15

enact a statute designating certain traditional public

16

forums, portions of sidewalks or public parks and so on,

17

as sort of free zones solely for recreation or commerce so

18

long as they did not do so based on, at least on the

19

content of the speech that might otherwise take place

20

there?

21

22

23

MR. BURSON:

Do you mean outside the context of

the election zone?
QUESTION:

Yeah, how broad is your principle of

24

the State may sort of eliminate the traditional forum

25

character of public forums?

MR. BURSON:

Well, I think there are

laws that

2

do regulate your use.

For instance, there's a

law that

3

requires you to get a permit.

4

going to have 5,000 people at a public part or something,

5

you have to take out a permit that's regulated.

can then cut that area off for those exclusive

purposes.

Well, how about my examples?

Sort of

8

communication-free zones where people can go and not be

9

bothered in otherwise public forums?

10
11

Is the State on your

theory free to do that?
MR. BURSON:

I would say that our theory is that

12

what we are expressing is limited to these election zones.

13

You have to look at the very fundamental interests and

14

what the State's duty is that would justify such a zone.

15

And that's as far as we're going in this argument.

16

What -- it appears to us that the court, the

17

Tennessee Supreme Court, failed to address this issue in a

18

real-world context.

19

proposition that because all subject matter was not

20

included, that that, per se, triggered content based.

21

We've discussed that before and we do not think that is a

22

proper approach.

23

that to determine whether or not the purposes are

24

justified without reference to the content of the speech.

25

But basically they failed to consider this in a

2

failure to deal with the substantive constitutional legal

3

distinction.

4

court demonstrates this.

5

might meet constitutional muster.

6

then that the court recognized the State's

7

constitutionally protectable interest outside the polling

8

place.

9

The concluding analysis of the Tennessee
The court suggested 25 feet
It must be assumed,

However, the alternative that the court

10

suggested, 25 feet instead of 100 feet, is one of degree.

11

Such a difference doesn't have a constitutional

12

significance.

It's not a true alternative in kind.

13

If I might, the dissent in this case --

14

QUESTION:

15

But if that argument is valid, I

suppose it would be okay to have 3,000-foot limit.
MR. BURSON:

16

I think that question, Justice

17

Stevens, goes to the one that Justice Kennedy raised.

18

State would have to be able to show that the statute is

19

fashioned to serve these legitimate purposes which justify

20

them.

21

brings into question the true purpose of the statute.

The

There is a point that you could get out which

And the Tennessee Supreme Court said

100 feet is too much, but 25 feet isn't.

Well, we would --we would suggest

that it is.

think the Court can observe for itself 25 feet to the end

of the press section, and almost 100 across this is - - the

6

same issues are implicated.

7

Just like in Buckley, the difference between

QUESTION:

But one of the differences the court

8

pointed was that the evidence, as I remembered, really

9

related to what happened either in the polls or right

10

outside the door.

And that if you go the full 100 feet,

11

you pick up the sidewalk and so forth in some areas.
MR. BURSON:

Well, you know, this was basically

13

a facial challenge.

The evidence, quite frankly, was very

skimpy.

I could draw as many hypotheticals whether 25

Once you acknowledge -- it's our position, once

16
17

you acknowledge the interest outside the polling place,

then it's the legislature, and there should be a

presumption of constitutionality, who is in the best

position, through experience and the studies they're able

21

to do, to determine what that appropriate distance would

be.

Do you defend the court's decision

That would be correct, at least

to the extent of any kind of solicitation of one of the

7

other to vote his way.
QUESTION:

9

That would be prohibited.

Would the statute prohibit a person

from driving down a public street that was within the

10

100-foot limit with a bumper sticker on the car that was

11

in support of a candidate?

12
13

MR. HERBISON:

This statute would prohibit that.

That would clearly be the display of campaign material.

QUESTION:

Well, that may be.

wouldn't necessarily be void on its face just because of

that.

MR. HERBISON:

Has it been

General Burson pointed out, there are a lot of these

now -- the earliest ohe I find goes back to 1875.

11

between 1889 and 1905, there are at least 22 States that

In the case of the subway or

We submit

that that is incorrect.
