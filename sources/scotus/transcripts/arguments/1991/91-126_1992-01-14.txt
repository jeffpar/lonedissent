We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JIM WAIDE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAIDE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

My client, Howard Wyatt, the petitioner, is a

cattle farmer in Simpson County, Mississippi.

12

cattle partnership with the respondent, Bill Cole.

13

July of 1986 the partners weren't getting along very

well --

MR. WAIDE:

19

what the terms were or how they were going to break it up,

20

and they had further discussions scheduled.

Now, they had never been able to agree on

21

The day before they were to meet for further

22

discussions on breaking up the partnership, my client,

23

Mr. Wyatt, who is not a very sophisticated man and who has

24

less than a high school education, comes home and he finds

out at the farm in Simpson County --he finds on his

6

That's what he finds when he

He's never -- through 2 days of taking over the

7

property they never serve him with any papers, but they do

8

after they've taken what Cole contends is his share of the

9

partnership property.

As it turns out they have an order

10

from the judge that says take 23 head of cattle and other

11

personal property, and they take possession of it.

12

Now, Your Honor, these cattle are Brahma cattle,

13

which probably means not much to most members of this

14

Court, but it's a peculiar type of cow, and that is that a

15

Brahma, if Your Honors have ever watched a rodeo, once

16

these cattle have ever been driven with horses or ever

17

been chased with dogs they become mean and unmanageable.

18

You can't keep them behind a fence, and after that their

19

value is diminished.

20

they're worth by the pound.

They're worth nothing more than what

If you're gentle with the cattle, if you treat

them right, some of these cattle -- one of the cows the

QUESTION:

Yes, but when you run them enough

they become very gentle.

MR. WAIDE:

Anyway, Your Honor, Brahma cattle

are probably not that important to most of us, even though

10

Mississippians probably have more appreciation than some

11

of us that live in Washington, D.C., but to my client, Mr.

12

Wyatt, these animals were very important to him.

13

were important to his family -- it's what he done.

QUESTION:

He had

Well, does that really bear on the

constitutional issue?
MR. WAIDE:

No, sir, it probably doesn't, except

18

that the defendants are claiming good faith and innocence

19

and I think it might have some bearing on that, that they

20

would have known what they were going to do to him.

21

QUESTION:

But the good faith and innocence

22

claim goes to their knowledge about the

23

unconstitutionality of the statute, not to the disposition

24

of the cattle.

MR. WAIDE:

Yes, sir, that's correct, Your

Honor.
The end result of it, in any event, was that a

hearing was finally held.

4

provided for a preseizure -- strike that --a prehearing

seizure.

making an affidavit and then you have a hearing later.

7

That was basically the scheme of the statute, and of

8

course Mr. --

11

The Mississippi statute

You go out and seize somebody's property on

QUESTION:

So it's not a preseizure hearing,

it's a postseizure hearing.
MR. WAIDE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

12

Mississippi statute provided or allowed --it could be

13

interpreted to provide -- the Mississippi supreme court

14

later ruled this is an incorrect interpretation, but it

15

could be read to say that you can go seize somebody's

16

property and then have the hearing later.

17

You just file your affidavit with the judge that

18

you're entitled to the property, he automatically issues

19

the order to go pick up the property, and then you have

20

the hearing later after posting a bond, so you can be

21

sued, of course, if you were wrong in making the seizure.

22

So that's basically the statutory scheme, and

23

that's the way that they were able to come take the

24

cattle, and after having them a few days Mr. Cole

25

transported them to Texas, even though a State judge ruled

that the order of replevin was wrong in the first place.

QUESTION:

3

MR. WAIDE:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WAIDE:

Well, you had a postseizure hearing.
That's correct.
What happened at the hearing?
Thank you, Your Honor.

At the

6

postseizure hearing the circuit judge ruled that the

7

replevin was erroneously issued under State law, that this

8

dividing up a partnership is not within the replevin

9

statute.

10

You're not wrongfully detaining property when

you detain it as a partnership.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WAIDE:

So what did he order?
He ordered him -- I might point this

13

out, Your Honor.

He ordered him to bring the cattle back

14

or pay damages, but at this point, of course, if he

15

brought the cattle back that wouldn't remedy the wrong,

16

because the damages was caused in large part by chasing

17

them.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WAIDE:

And then what happened?
Let me finish my answer, if I

20

might -- and also, Your Honor, my client, who's never had

21

any history of psychiatric problems, suffered a mental

22

breakdown and was hospitalized, and the remedy of bringing

23

the cattle back which a State judge ordered wouldn't have

24

cured that.

25

But in any event, he didn't follow the judge's

order.

2

far as he wanted to use it, and Mr. Cole just did not

3

follow the order of the State judge.

He'd taken advantage of the replevin statute as

4

Cole claimed his lawyer, Robbins, never told him

5

about it.

Robbins said he told him about it and he

6

doesn't know why he didn't follow it.

7

didn't follow the order of the State judge.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WAIDE:

But anyway, he

And then what happened?
Your Honor, the next thing that

10

happened was we decided for strategic reasons and because

11

we believed, erroneously as it turned out, we'd be better

12

off in the United States District Court, we took a nonsuit

13

of our pending proceeding.

14

owed us damages, but we didn't know how much damages or

15

how the State law was going to be interpreted, and we took

16

a voluntary nonsuit of the State replevin action and filed

17

suit in the United States District Court, so that's how

18

this case got started.

19

The State judge had said he

Now, Your Honor, even though 42 -- and I feel

20

like I'm right in saying this -- even though 42 U.S.C.

21

section 1983 says in the broadest of terms that everybody,

22

every person who violates another's constitutional rights

23

under color of law is subject to damages, even though the

24

statute says that, under well-settled principles that this

25

Court has announced in many decisions, the district judge

1

held that just about everybody involved was clearly immune

2

from suit -- everybody.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WAIDE:

Absolutely.
Yes, sir, and very little question

5

about it, most of it we abandoned in the district court.

6

We sued everybody, but most of it we abandoned because we

7

thought this Court's decisions didn't leave us any room.
QUESTION:

8

9
10
11

Was this absolute immunity, or

qualified?
MR. WAIDE:

In this case they're claiming

qualified immunity for a private defendant.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WAIDE:

That's what the district judge ruled.
Yes, sir.

The State was immune, of

14

course, because of the Eleventh Amendment.

15

everybody knows the judge was immune, and of course we

16

didn't sue the judge.

17

from making a judicial decision.

18

reasons why the law officers were immune.

19

them to go out there and seize the cattle, and they

20

couldn't be put in the position very well of violating the

21

court's order of being held in contempt, but in addition

22

to that we had the qualified immunity, which we think is

23

very tough to overcome, but those immunities.

Of course,

Everybody knows that he was immune

So we just -- even though the statute says, here

you are, you're got a remedy, under the immunity doctrines

1

as they developed we didn't have any remedy because -- and

2

the reason we're here today, and the only person that was

3

involved that was not subject to decisions of this Court,

4

and we don't believe the decisions of this Court have been

5

followed in this case, was Cole and his attorney, Robbins.

6

That is the private party immunity, immunity of private

7

parties who violate constitutional rights, and that's the

8

question that's before the Court today.

9

Justice O'Connor in Forrester v. White sounded a

10

familiar theme for this Court, a theme that is said over

11

and over again in these immunity cases, when Your Honor

12

said we don't extend immunity beyond what its policy

13

considerations are.

14

policies that the immunity was created for.

15

directly in Forrester v. White and is a theme, I think, in

16

this Court's qualified immunity cases.

17

In applying immunity, we look to the
That was said

Now, Your Honor, the policies that this Court

18

has announced in qualified immunity cases are very clear

19

and are just about the opposite of any policies that might

20

be involved in this case.

21

said and said over and again probably beginning with

22

Harlow v. Fitzgerald, but over and over again, we want to

23

attract citizens to public office.

24

it undesirable for a citizen -- unnecessarily desirable

25

for a citizen to hold public office.

For example, this Court has

We don't want to make

1

We're not involved in that.

Mr. Robbins and

2

Mr. Cole are not candidates for public office.

3

just the opposite.

4

They're

They're private people.

And then, Your Honors, probably the strongest

5

case for immunity is the law enforcement officer, the

6

fellow that's out there and he's trying to decide whether

7

to make an arrest.

8

9

If he makes the arrest, this Court has said we
don't want to hold him liable for exercising his judgment

10

and trying to save society from some criminal act in

11

making the arrest.

12

discretionary decision.

13

that decision on whether somebody committed a crime and

14

whether they ought to be arrested based on exercising his

15

discretion in carrying out a public function.

16

that's not involved in this case.

17

with this case.

18

We don't want to put a burden on that
We want him to be able to make

Of course,

That has nothing to do

And then, Your Honor, probably the strongest

19

thing, or the thing that's so applicable to public

20

officials and so inapplicable to a private party, when you

21

look at Mitchell v. Forsyth this Court made it very clear

22

that it's not just an immunity from damages, it's an

23

immunity from suit.

24

his mind off of his important public duties, take his time

25

away from them, by having to defend the suit, and so not

The official is not supposed to take

1

only it is a freedom from damages, but it's a freedom from

2

suit so he can take an immediate appeal.

3

Now, to put these people in that position and

4

say we don't want to take their minds off of public duties

5

and they can take an immediate appeal is just totally

6

inconsistent with the policies of Mitchell v. Forsyth.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Waide, that may be true with

8

respect to official immunity, but we adopted official

9

immunity for 1983 actions because it was in existence in

10

1870.

There was also a private immunity in 1870, though,

11

for people bringing legal actions.

12

I mean, you couldn't sue and recover for false

13

arrest, for malicious prosecution, for abuse of process,

14

without showing that the person brought that legal process

15

without probable cause, which meant that the person had to

16

have entertained a subjective belief that he was not

17

justified in going ahead.

18

immunity -- not official immunity, but the immunity of a

19

person invoking the legal process which existed in 1870,

20

why shouldn't that be applied to 1983?

21

MR. WAIDE:

Now, why shouldn't that same

Your Honor, first, it's -- I think

22

it's probably not quite accurate to characterize that as

23

an immunity.

24

characterize that as an affirmative defense to suit.

25

is to say that if you have probable cause or malice, there

I consider -- it's more accurate to

That

1

might be some defenses to the suit that could be raised.
QUESTION:

2

No, it was not a defense.

The

3

plaintiff had to show it, so I don't care whether you call

4

it an immunity or not - -

5

MR. WAIDE:

QUESTION:

7

But it would have been your burden to

show it.
MR. WAIDE:

8

9

All right, sir.

All right, sir.

Anyway, it was a

matter that would be taken up at trial.

It's a matter

10

that would be taken up at trial, it's not a defense from

11

suit.

12

defense from even having to undergo a trial.

An immunity, as this Court has construed it, is a

13

QUESTION:

Well, no, you would have to plead it.

14

You would have to plead that subjectively malicious frame

15

of mind, or you wouldn't even get past the summary

16

judgment stage.

17

MR. WAIDE:

Well, Your Honor, I certainly don't

18

mean to argue with the Court.

19

interpretation of it was, it was an affirmative defense,

20

but in any event of course there was no summary judgment

21

procedure.

22

that I drew from it was, it was a matter that would be

23

submitted to the jury at trial, the issue of malice, an

24

affirmative -- well, where there's an affirmative defense

25

and not a matter for the factfinder.

I thought - - my

And Your Honor, I wouldn't quarrel -- let me say

this, Your Honor.

supreme court I think took the correct view of this matter

4

in a case that the respondent cited, and they said there

might be some defenses you could raise at trial.

6

might be able to show -- it might be Mr. Cole would come

7

up at trial and say well, I thought the statute was legal

on its --if the Court wanted to adopt a subjective good

faith standard, I don't find that nearly so objectable as

I wouldn't quarrel -- the Mississippi

You

10

saying you can't even get to first base, this is an

11

immunity from suit.

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That's what you should have taken to

the State court.
MR. WAIDE:

Justice White, ironically we should

15

have, because -- and I think this is an another important

16

facet about this case --if this Court is going to adopt a

17

policy, and that's what it has to do, Your Honor; Justice

18

White in the Burns case very recently said this Court has

19

no authority to just judicially create policies, and

20

Justice Scalia, that's why, of course, the Court looks to

21

the common law background.

22

But in this case, if this Court adopts a policy,

23

if this Court says we're going to have a policy that

24

private defendants can't be sued, I think it's important

25

to think about what policy interest is it that we're
14

1

implementing, and to me that is the policy of the State of

2

Mississippi, the policy of the State of Mississippi to

3

protect -- to allow its citizens to rely on statutes.

4

That would be the policy that the Court would be looking

5

at, that particular policy, and I think that

6

42 U.S.C. 1988 counsels this Court to look at what State

7

policies are.

8

Now, the State of Mississippi, Your Honor, on

9

the comment that we should have stayed in State court, in

10

retrospect we certainly should have because the case that

11

counsel cited consistent with his ethical duty to cite

12

cases contrary to his position, the Mississippi supreme

13

court has said in the Foremost case that he cited that

14

they don't see --in effect they don't see any Mississippi

15

policy prohibiting a suit against a person that wrongfully

16

implements -- wrongfully brings a replevin action.

17

the policy that Mississippi announced.

18

that I don't understand on it --

19

QUESTION:

That's

Now, the thing

Do you think then, Mr. Waide, that

20

the outcome here should depend on what the policy is in

21

each of the 50 States?

22

MR. WAIDE:

No, Your Honor, I don't.

The only

23

point that -- I might say it wouldn't differ in this case,

24

because all the States have similar policies, but I'll get

25

to that in a second.

But the only thing that I'm saying,

1

Your Honor, if we're talking about a policy-

2

decision -- we're talking about a policy.

3

we're talking about.

4

policy, going to create an immunity?

5

That's what

Is this Court, as a matter of

I'm saying that if the Court does that, the

6

policy that it would have to be implementing or trying to

7

carry out is an interest the State of Mississippi has.

8

That would be the policy.

9

Now, Your Honor, I understand the danger that

10

Your Honor Mr. Chief Justice is talking about, that you'd

11

have a different rule of immunity from State to State.

12

might say, Your Honor, that in Robertson v. Wagaman this

13

Court addressed that and said 42 U.S.C. 1988 counsels, or

14

means there's bound to be some differences.

15
16
17

19

I

Of course, we have different statutes of
limitations because we look to State law.
QUESTION:

So is the answer to the question that

I asked you yes or no?
MR. WAIDE:

Your Honor, my answer to this

20

question is it would be uniform across the States.

21

reason I say that is because in Dora v.

22

In other words, all the States contemplate that

the private person wrongfully bringing a replevin action

can be sued.

That's what I'm saying, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Because you say the policy of all 50

States is to allow an action against someone who

MR. WAIDE:

The only

point that I'm making, Your Honor -- that is correct, but

19

the only point that I'm making is the States, as a matter

20

of policy, do not have a policy that people who bring

21

replevin actions are immune from suit.

22

QUESTION:

No, but you don't answer the question

of whether there might be States in which there would be

some showing of malice required, if you're talking about

MR. WAIDE:

1

All right.

Well, Your Honor, in the

2

first place I would assume, at least for the sake of

3

argument, that in any type of suit as a factual matter,

4

any type of suit that's based on some type of abuse of

5

process or malicious prosecution theory, which is what

6

this essentially is, that type of suit there are certain

7

factual matters that the jury could take into account, and

8

I think one of those might be whether this person acted

9

intentionally or something, but that doesn't -- the

10

qualified immunity is an objective standard.

11

immunity from suit, and that's what -- all I'm asking this

as a matter of evidence.

is that you have no cause of action -- if it's qualified

2

immunity, as this Court has announced it, is a legal

standard of objective rulings.

5

It's a question of whether they acted contrary to law, and

what I'm saying is there are certain matters the

11

It's not necessary, Your Honor, for this Court

12

to even reach the question of what kind of matters might

be admissible into evidence at trial, and I'm simply

14

suggesting to the Court that when we go to trial we will

probably call some lawyers and they would say, well it was

at least known everywhere that there's some question about

17

whether this is constitutional or not.

a question that this Court has said again and again that

2

these things are of questionable legality, and the

3

Mississippi supreme court, Your Honor, in its opinion

appeared shocked that anybody would do anything like this

and said that its understanding of the statute was that

there had to be some emergency reason to go out and seize

property before a hearing.

8

from the statute.

9

That's -- you can't get that

But the Mississippi supreme court, if anybody is

10

going to have a policy against not suing or allowing

11

reliance on the State statute, it is surely the

12

Mississippi supreme court.

13

I might say the Attorney General, Your Honor,

14

was an amicus curiae in this case and he took no position

15

on this issue. He said, I concede the statute's

unconstitutional, but he didn't take any position that I

want our private citizens not to be sued.

justify this Court giving any immunity at all, so

2

immunity, which is a legal defense, is just out.

3

Qualified immunity is out, and I don't know that

4

it's appropriate for this Court to announce exactly what

5

defenses maybe Cole could raise down in the courts, but if

6

the Court is going to do that, I would just suggest that

7

those analogous defenses that exist in the common law,

Mr. Cole ought to be able to get up there and say, I

Your Honor, and what I'm saying is it's --

MR. WAIDE:

Do you concede that that's a

Your Honor, the appropriate course

13

in this case, in my opinion, is to decide the case before

the Court, which is that the qualified immunity doctrine

MR. WAIDE:

Your Honor, the State law standards

and generally in a malicious prosecution or abuse of

MR. WAIDE:

So we do this tort by tort.
Well, Your Honor, the fact that we

MR. WAIDE:

That's correct, Your Honor, but when

there's nothing in the statute, it's just general that you

look to the common law or the to State law, and we think

that -- Your Honor, we think that even if the jury's

instructed on malice, that we had to prove that as an

ruled that this was a matter of law, and that's consistent

with Your Honor's decisions, and that we were not going to

QUESTION:

Why would we apply these defenses as

6

immunity -- official immunity as a matter of State law.

We simply determined that when this Federal statute was

passed in 1870 there was such a thing.

We changed it a

immunity, so we apply it as a matter of Federal law.

11

shouldn't we do the same thing with respect to private

12

immunity or defenses against liability?

13

MR. WAIDE:

Why

Well, Your Honors do apply State law

14

and have frequently applied State law on various defenses

15

that might come up such as the statute of limitations, or

16

such as survivorship rules.

17

and 1988 contemplates that you'll look to common law or

18

State law for the rules of decision in a lot of cases, and

19

I see nothing wrong with doing that in this case, and I

20

also see no inconsistency, assuming that's a bad thing.

QUESTION:

No, I'm not talking about statutes of

limitations, I'm talking about substantive defenses to the

cause of action.

4

MR. WAIDE:

5

QUESTION:

Well -It seems very strange to create a

6

Federal cause of action and say however, what defenses

7

exist to this Federal cause of action ought to be a matter

8

of State law.

9

It's very strange.

MR. WAIDE:

Well, Your Honor, all that I can say

10

is it's always my assumption in trying 1983 cases, and it

11

appears to be universally done, if there's no rule,

12

there's no Federal rule -- you know, if we're talking

13

about a cause of action and there's nothing in any statute

14

that says what the elements are for this cause of action,

15

you've got to look somewhere for the rule of law, so to me

16

the logical place to look and dictate it by 1988 is State

17

law or the common law.

18

That's what the statute directs the court to do,

19

and of course as in Erie v. Tompkins there's no general

Federal common law, so that's the only place logically

that you could look.

and the value of the property, and there hasn't been any

The damages were the loss of use of the property

QUESTION:

Well, anyway, whatever you could have

collected on the bond, the bondsman could have collected

from his principal.

19

MR. WAIDE:

Yes, sir, that would be correct,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

20

And it wouldn't -- and the principal

wouldn't have been able to plead any kind of immunity or

22

any defense against that kind of action.

23

MR. WAIDE:

liability.

In analyzing whether to extend immunity to

parties who come before it as section 1983 defendants,

3

this Court has engaged in a dual history and policy

analysis, and I would first address the issue of what is

the compelling public policy which would cause this Court

to formally extend immunity to those persons who act such

as my clients, Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins did, and I would

say, Your Honor, that the public policy that is foremost

for there ever to be a recovery against private party

4

unconstitutionality by the district court, since he did

5

not comply with the order.
A second point that seems to be made by

6

7

Mr. Wyatt's counsel is - -

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MCNAMARA:

10

That's a new cause of action?
No, Your Honor.

In the Fifth

Circuit Court of Appeals - QUESTION:

11

I mean, when he fails to obey a

12

ruling of the district court that was made in this 1983

13

suit, I assume you say that's a new and independent

14

violation for which there must be some other 1983

15

action - -

16

MR. McNAMARA:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

No, Your Honor.

--or was this just a contempt of

court?
MR. McNAMARA:

No, Your Honor.

The Fifth

20

Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed everything which came to

21

it from the district court except that it remanded for a

22

finding of attorney's fees against Mr. Cole for the reason

23

that he had engaged in conduct which violated the statute

24

after the district court judge had declared it

25

unconstitutional.

1

The jury had found no damages at the trial below

2

because for the main reason that counsel for Mr. Wyatt

3

conceded that there were no damages occurring even for the

4

mental anguish which he alleges his client to have

5

suffered, that no damages occurred after the declaration

6

of unconstitutionality, that all of the damages which Mr.

7

Wyatt was claiming he said occurred before the declaration

8

of unconstitutionality, and Mr. Waide has alluded to the

9

great emotion and upset that he experienced because of the

10
11

taking of his cattle.
Now, a second public policy reason to consider

12

is that if the Court does not grant immunity to private

13

persons who acted as Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins did, then

14

the Court would be putting the burden of paying for the

15

unconstitutionality of the Mississippi statute on the

16

persons who absolutely have the minimal involvement in

17

this case, and in this Court's decision last term in Burns

18

v. Reed, in discussing the extension of -- well, actually

19

the issue was, of course, whether the prosecutor would be

20

entitled to absolute immunity in his role of giving the

21

advice to the police.

22

In his majority opinion at -- I've got 114

23

Lawyer's Edition 2nd 564 -- there is a discussion by the

24

majority there as to why should we extend this grant of

25

absolute immunity to the prosecutor in his role of

1

advising the police and then grant only the limited or

2

qualified immunity to the police.

3

So this Court has previously looked at who has

4

the most involvement, who has the most ability to

5

determine the unconstitutionality of the statute, and one

6

of the comments that the Court makes there is that those

7

police officers are certainly not going to have the law

8

training that prosecutors have.
QUESTION:

But one of the people here for whom

10

you're seeking immunity is a lawyer, I gather, and that

11

person would certainly have law training, one assumes.

12

MR. McNAMARA:

That's right, Your Honor, and in

13

Harlow v. Fitzgerald in the majority opinion when it's

14

discussing the objective standard which would be applied,

15

that this Court says that we're going to look at it as

16

whether or not a reasonable person would know that the

17

action taken would be a clear violation of the

18

constitutional rights of the defendant, and further on in

1

that opinion it clarifies -- the opinion is clarified

20

where the Court says we're going to look at the reasonable

21

Government official.

22

And so in this instance in the application of

23

the objective standard, one can look at the reasonable

24

attorney, one could look at the reasonable person who's

25

just somewhat casually engaged in the cattle business, or

1

one could look at whether the 1983 defendant was Citibank

2

who may be bringing replevin actions at numbers per hour

3

throughout the United States.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. McNamara, as I recollect, one

5

reason we have adopted the objective standard for official

6

immunity, which I as recollect was not the common law

7

approach, was that officials are subject to suit all the

8

time.

9

every time they obey their orders they have to go through

10

They'll spend their whole lifetime in court if

a trial to show subjective good faith.
Now, that isn't the case with respect to private

11
12

individuals.

They're not going to be drawn into this

13

thing repeatedly.

14

protection?

Why do they need that same kind of

MR. McNAMARA:

15

Obviously, even the Citibank

16

example that I gave is not going to have the potential

17

exposure that the public officer would, but it seems to me

18

that there's an important public policy in encouraging

19

people such as Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins to utilize

20

procedures that are presumptively valid at the time they

21

use them.

22

QUESTION:

Well, but sure there is, but we could

23

take account of that by giving a good faith

24

immunity -- subjective good faith immunity, not just the

25

objective standard.

MR. McNAMARA:

1

Your Honor, and in this case,

2

that the issue which petitioner raised in the brief was

3

the question of whether or not there should be an

4

extension of immunity, and the petitioner did not argue

5

some alternative to the objective standard of immunity

6

which was applied by the Fifth Circuit and by the district

7

court, and we would say under these circumstances, since

8

there happened to have been in the case before the Court

9

extensive discovery, this is not a situation coming before

10

the Court where there were simply pleadings and where my

11

clients moved for summary judgment on the basis of Harlow

12

Fitzgerald immunity.

13

If there was some malicious conduct, or if there

14

was some evidence of some special knowledge that either of

15

my clients possessed below, then that was not put forward

16

by the plaintiff at that time, .and it would -- our

17

position would be that in this case if the Court should

18

decide that there should be an extension of immunity but

19

it should be something other than the objective or

20

reasonable objectiveness standard from Harlow v.

21

Fitzgerald, that remand would not be necessary, because

22

there's no indication of any lack of good faith on the

23

part of

1

Court that might raise a question about the validity of

2

the replevin statute in Mississippi?

3

MR. McNAMARA:

Your Honor, I would rely upon

4

what the district judge stated, and that is that at the

5

time of the execution or use of the statute by John

6

Robbins, that there was not complete agreement about the

7

law.

8

For instance, in the Mitchell v. W.T. Grant case

9

involving, I believe it's Louisiana sequestration statute,

10

there was some similar infirmities there. For instance, I

11

think that in that case, or in the case of that statute,

12

that the writ of sequestration could be issued by a clerk

13

and there was a provision there that the person against

14

whom the writ was issued could come into court and seek a

15

dissolution, but there were similar safeguards available

16

to the Mississippi statute, and I would say this.

17

In 1975, the Mississippi legislature revised an

18

earlier edition of the replevin statute because the first

19

edition which I'm familiar with did not have the

20

requirement of bond, did not have the availability for

21

advancing the course on the docket, and so I would say

22

that a reasonable attorney even with more expertise in the

23

area than Mr. Robbins had would not come to the conclusion

24

that this statute was unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

I didn't see it cited in anybody's

MR. McNAMARA:

9

I don't believe that I did, and I

10

checked my table of contents to see if I'd just forgotten

11

it.

12

Your Honor, if there had been malicious conduct

13

on the part of my clients in this case there was a remedy

14

available under State law, and in fact the remedy

15

available under State law for the wrongful attachment was

16

a remedy of which the petitioner in this case chose not to

17

avail himself.

18

I would concede under Mississippi law that the

19

damages which are available for the suing out of wrongful

20

attachment would not include the mental anguish which

21

Mr. Wyatt alleges to have suffered, but there are

QUESTION:

MR. McNAMARA:

Even Brahmas.
Your Honor, Mr. Waide knows a lot

more about Brahmas than I do, but those damages would be

available if there had been a decrease in the market value

11

of those cattle as a result of the change in their

12

behavior, then that could be recovered under Mississippi

13

law.

QUESTION:

Do you concede that under Lugar

against Edmondson Oil there can be a cause of action under

unconstitutional?

this case, and I believe that this circuit alluded to this

2

in the Folsom Investment Company case, it said that the

3

first line of defense in these cases should be the

4

legislature who passed it, or the Attorney General of the

5

State who in some instances would enforce statutes, and

6

that the burden of paying for the unconstitutionality of

7

this statute should not fall upon persons such as Wyatt

and Cole.

QUESTION:

Mr. McNamara, when you said that

10

there would be a remedy under Mississippi law for the

suing out of a wrongful attachment, what do you mean by

No, Your Honor, in the joint

15

appendix which was submitted where Judge Barbour, the

16

district judge in this case, was citing to circuit court

17

Judge Jerry Yeager's opinion, after dismissing the

18

attachment that Judge Yeager said that Mr. Wyatt would be

19

able to recover damages for wrongful attachment, that in

20

the initial suit in circuit court is that Judge Yeager

21

said the replevin statute was not what should have been

22

utilized because these gentlemen were partners and they

23

should not have resorted to the replevin statute, so my

24

understanding of the record is that Judge Yeager was

prepared to award some damages but it wasn't all the

damages Mr. Wyatt felt that he was entitled.
QUESTION:

Not on the basis that the replevin

3

statute was unconstitutional, but that it didn't cover

4

that particular situation.

5

MR. McNAMARA:

Right, Your Honor.

There was not

6

a declaration in the circuit court of unconstitutionality.

7

It was simply, you've picked out the wrong attempted

8

remedy, Mr. Cole, by coming here, because you are

9

partners, and you should seek dissolution of your

10

partnership and proceed under that particular set of

11

statutes in Mississippi which provides for the splitting

12

up of partnerships.

QUESTION:

Let me ask another case about

It was in the brief of

at page 3.

4

QUESTION:

What did it hold?

MR. McNAMARA:

Your Honor, the supreme court of

6

Mississippi was examining the application of good faith

immunity to private defendants under color of State law.

That's the case we talked about

earlier.

That's right, Your Honor.

I see.

You were not counsel when the

brief in opposition was filed, I understand.

13

MR. McNAMARA:

No, Your Honor, I was not.

14

What the petitioner wants to do in this case is

15

to deny the extension of immunity, and when this Court has

16

denied the extension of immunity it has relied in part on

17

policy grounds and part on the historical inquiry which

18

I'll get to in a second, but for instance, in Owen v. City

19

of Independence, the court there at the end of the opinion

20

makes the comment basically that it is as a matter of

21

policy equating the role -- has done equity in that it

22

would provide a plaintiff with a remedy, it would allow

23

the official who acts in good faith to go about his duties

24

without fear of being dragged into court, and it makes the

25

public pay only for those unconstitutional policies which

the State enforces, and so therefore it spreads the

2

liability for the unconstitutionality of a statute among

3

the citizens of the State, and that would not be done in

4

this case.

placed upon the private party.

It would be quite the opposite.

It would be

As far as the historical analysis is concerned,

6

7

this Court has looked at historical analyses most strongly

8

when it was denying - - or when it was granting full

9

immunity as in the case of legislatures, prosecutors, and

10

judges.

11

Anderson v. Creighton, there has not been the great

12

reliance upon historical precedent.

13

In the later inquiries there is not -- such as in

When a police officer at common law did not have

14

reasonable grounds to act in effectuating an arrest or

15

carrying out a search, then he had a defense which was

16

based upon a subjective standard, and this Court in

17

Anderson v. Creighton adopted the Harlow v. Fitzgerald

18

standard and said we will make it an objective

19

reasonableness standard.

20

There's no reason, logically, then, why that

21

same standard cannot translate to be utilized by the

22

private defendant, and one of the things that I think that

23

Wyatt overlooks is that the good faith --or excuse me,

24

the objective reasonableness standard which is applied as

25

an immunity in these cases is, after all, an affirmative

1

defense, and so the party asserting that affirmative

2

defense has to come forward and on a motion for summary

3

judgment bears the burden of showing that he would come

4

under terms of the immunity.

5

Your Honor, in this particular case Mr.

6

Wyatt --or excuse me, Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins utilized a

7

statute which neither of them had reason to believe was

8

unconstitutional, and they were attempting to go about

9

utilizing an orderly process, although it turned out to be

10

the wrong process, and the court's reasoning below in the

11

Fifth Circuit for the granting of extension of immunity

12

should be adopted here.

13

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

And you think that they don't make it

pretty clear that a prejudgment hearing is necessary?
MR. McNAMARA:

No, Your Honor, because the

21

Mississippi replevin statute says --or provides for a

22

person to be able to come in and challenge the taking of

the property, and I believe it gives it a hearing within

3 days to seek to set aside the writ of replevin, and it

1

Mitchell case that there were sufficient constitutional

2

safeguards, but the important issue perhaps for the

3

purposes of this case is in judging the conduct of the

4

defendants under the objective reasonable standard, that

5

the trial court said that objectively it could be

6

determined that the statute was not one which was clearly

7

unconstitutional at the time.

8

Your Honor, the extension of qualified immunity

9

in this situation would be uniform, it would be in keeping

10

with the prior decisions of this Court, it would be a just

11

resolution for private party defendants who until Lugar v.

12

Edmondson were - - those were among a class of persons who

13

by most lawyers were not even dreamed to be potential

14

section 1983 defendants, and the holdings in the Adickes

15

v. S.H. Kress Company, and in other cases where a private

16

party acts in conspiracy with a judge or public official,

17

those holdings would be held intact, and furthermore, to

18

use the example of Adickes v. Kress case, even if the

19

court decided to grant qualified immunity in a situation

20

such as that, those parties would not meet the objective

21

reasonableness standard because there was a clear

22

violation of constitutional rights.

there's adequate historical basis for an analogy to give a
