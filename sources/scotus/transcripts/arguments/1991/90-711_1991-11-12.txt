ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

10

MR. STILL:

Thank you.

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This case presents the question, under section 5

12

of the Voting Rights Act, whether a county must submit for

13

preclearance a transfer of power away from an individual

14

county commissioner to either a white majority county

15

commission or an official appointed by that county

16

commission.

17

submitted, because they affect the power of voters to

18

elect commissioners who can respond to citizens' wishes.

19

We contend that these changes must be

In Etowah County, this transfer occurred

20

immediately after the election of Lawrence Presley, the

21

first black county commissioner in the county's history,

22

and therefore diminished the power of that black county

23

commissioner.

24

black voters in his district to control roadwork in their

25

particular district.

This, in turn, affected the power of the

1

In the South, roads have traditionally been the

2

main concern of county commissions.

3

commissioner's responsiveness to his constituents is

4

judged by how well he handles their complaints and

5

concerns about the roadwork.

MR. STILL:

QUESTION:

The road

Mr. Still, these two counties are not

No, sir, they are not.
One is in, where, northeast, and the

10

other one is on the east side?

11

MR. STILL:

On the eastern border, yes, sir.

12

One of them is Phenix City and the other is Gadsden.

13

you look on a map, that's the easy way to find them.

QUESTION:

name, and it gets mispronounced quite often.

commissioners to the whole commission, it assured two

2

things.

3

Commissioner Presley's district would not have to go to a

4

black official to talk about their problems, and secondly

5

that black voters would still have to come to white

6

officials — in this case a commission with a white

7

majority — to talk about their roads.

10

First of all, that the white voters in

QUESTION:

Could you tell me, how many votes did

it take to pass the common fund resolution in Etowah
County?
MR. STILL:

11

It took a majority of the six

12

members, and so it would have taken four votes, or the

13

chairman could have broken a tie of three, I believe.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STILL:

And a total of six?
There's a total of six, but there's

16

a seventh member who is a nonvoting chairman, and I

17

believe he has a tiebreaking power, so if they tie 3 to

18

3 —

20

QUESTION:

All right, then I take it the same

answer to repeal the resolution — same vote.

21

MR. STILL:

22

In Russell County, the — the transfer of power

23

occurred before blacks were elected, but in this case the

24

county is roughly 40 percent black.

25

county adopted what's called the county unit system, which

That's correct, it would be.

1

allows the county engineer to control all the roadwork as

2

an entire unit in the county.

3

jurisdictions in Alabama had already been forced to go to

4

single-member districts and had elected blacks.

5

handwriting was on the wall that single-member districts

and black elected officials were coming to Russell County.

7

QUESTION:

Can the board fire the engineer?

8

MR. STILL:

I believe he's a civil service

9
10
11

employee, sir.

They'd have to have cause, but they can

fire him in that sense.
As this Court unanimously found in Hunter v.

12

Underwood, the president of the 1901 Alabama

13

Constitutional Convention said the purpose of that

14

convention was to establish white supremacy in this State.

15

We believe these changes perpetuate a kind of white

16

supremacy which prevents blacks from having any real power

17

over white constituents.

18

type that Congress intended to cover when it passed

19

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

20

These changes are exactly the

To understand section 5, we think you've got to

21

understand the circumstances that led to its passage.

22

This Court in 1965 in South Carolina v. Katzenbach

23

described the situation.

24

to the extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules of

25

various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating black

1

political powerlessness in the face of adverse Federal

2

court decrees.
Congress had reason to suppose that these States

3
4

might try similar maneuvers in the future in order to

5

evade the remedies contained in the Voting Rights Act

6

itself, so Congress passed section 5 of the Voting Rights

7

Act to make sure that these sorts of changes wouldn't

8

continue to be brought along every time some stratagem was

9

knocked down.
Section 5 is supposed to change the balance of

10
11
12

power.

It's supposed to put —
QUESTION:

Well, regardless of what it's

13

supposed to do, what it says is that you have to clear any

14

voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard

15

practice or procedure with respect to voting, so what your

16

burden is, in this case, is to say that changing the

17

responsibilities of one of the members of the county's

18

officership is a qualification or prerequisite to voting

19

or standard practice or procedure with respect to voting.

20

Now, you can go under section 2, if it was done

21

for a discriminatory motive, right?

22

MR. STILL:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct, but section 5 —
But you're talking about going under

24

section 5 and requiring it to be precleared as a standard

25

practice or procedure with respect to voting.

I must say,

1

I would never in my wildest dream imagine that that

2

qualified under that language.

3

MR. STILL:

Well, section 5 was designed to get

4

at new changes that were made to stop those new

5

discriminatory changes from being made, and section 2 was

6

designed to get at those that happened to slip by that and

7

the preexisting ones.
QUESTION:

8

9

But not all changes, only a change of

a standard practice or procedure with respect to voting.
MR. STILL:

10

That's correct, and section 14

11

defines voting as — as encompassing all those things

12

necessary to make the vote effective, and one of the

13

things necessary to make the vote effective is that when

14

you elect a representative or a county commissioner, he be

15

able to do something — have some power to do something.

16
17

QUESTION:
effective?

That is necessary to make the vote

No, indeed.

18

MR. STILL:

19

QUESTION:

My vote is just as effective.

But the vote is effective —
You say — you're saying my vote

20

becomes less effective somehow when — when the Congress

21

takes away some powers that the President had before, that

22

they — they have made my vote less effective?

MR. STILL:

In — in terms of electing the

24

President, but in this — in this sense we're talking

25

about a county commissioner, and if once blacks get the

vote and get single-member districts so they can elect

2

county commissioners of their choice, then they find that

3

those county commissioners can't do anything for them,

4

they've had the value of their vote affected.
QUESTION:

5

I understand that there has been a

6

change, and I understand that the change may well have a

7

discriminatory motivation, but I don't see how it is a

8

change with respect to voting.

9

Because I think if it's — if it's

QUESTION:

Both of them use the same

If it affects voting, and it

Well, I guess under your theory

18

any — any reduction in funding, a lesser appropriation,

19

would also qualify for a section 5 approval.
MR. &TILL:

20

Some reductions in funding might be

21

covered by section 5 if they have — if they affect

22

voting, but we do not believe that you can draw a line

there.
QUESTION:

Well, from what you say it would seem

to me that any reduction in funding of a particular office

1

would be said to affect voting in a covered jurisdiction,

2

and yet I -- it's just almost inconceivable to think of

3

the flood of actions that would have to be reviewed if

4

your theory is correct, that that also constitutes a

5

change in voting practice or procedure.
MR. STILL:

6

Well, Congress defined voting in a

7

very broad way here, because they had seen that the South

8

and other covered jurisdictions had continued to use

9

various sorts of stratagems.

If the white primary was

10

declared unconstitutional, they adopted a new property

11

requirement or a new literacy test, so that there was

12

always something else, and in order —
QUESTION:

13

But those do relate to voting, of

14

course, and we're getting much further afield when we talk

15

about a drop in funding or a cut in the budget or

16

whatever.

17

MR. STILL:

Well, Etowah County, for instance,

18

in their brief in this case argued that it would be

19

pointless to require this to be precleared because the

20

State could always achieve the same result some other way,

21

and our point is that section 5 is written in a broad way,

22

with — especially with the definition found in section

23

14, that is designed to get at changes which have a

24

discriminatory impact on the — the rights of people to

25

vote, to have their vote counted effectively.

1

I think you -- I think in any case involving a

2

budget you'd probably have to look at a lot of different

3

circumstances to determine whether or not that had an

4

effect on the -- the electoral power on the people

eventually, or whether it was just sort of a routine

change in a budget.

QUESTION:

Do you take this —

9

QUESTION:

But isn't your test that if you can

10

imagine a set of circumstances in which it would be

11

racially discriminatory then there has to be preclearance?

12

MR. STILL:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

If you can —

Well, any time you cut an executive's

14

budget, he has less authority, so any budget-cutting has

15

to be submitted td the Attorney General.

16
17

MR. STILL:

Well, I would suggest not every time

you cut a — cut a budget.

QUESTION:

19

MR. STILL:

For instance —

I don't see —
You might have a general

2

soon as a black got elected, they cut the sheriff's budget

to $1 million and said well, you've just got to make up

change that certainly would have to be precleared, and I

would suggest for that reason we can't draw the line and

Well, but — but your test is, then

Then all budgets should probably

have to be precleared, but as a practical matter, only the

ones which have an effect on voting, and we have to keep

going back to whether it has an effect on voting, are the

events called budget adoption from coverage of section 5,

It affects voting when -- I gave

as — as a hypothetical when a newly-elected black sheriff

13

finds his budget cut by 90 percent, and I would say that

14

that would be fairly clear.

And that — that's because the people

We don't

MR. STILL:

1

Well, I think what you've got to

2

look at is if there was a 10 percent change.

3

all, the jurisdiction has two burdens here.

4

demonstrate that there is no purpose, there's no intent to

5

discriminate, and secondly that it will not have the

6

effect of discriminating against people on the basis of

7

their race, so it could be that a 10 percent cut was

carried out for a racial intent because there's a black

Yeah, well, I'm just trying to find

out what has to be submitted to the Attorney General, and

9

But you still haven't, at least to my

satisfaction, answered the question of what is your test

it seems to me that you must answer the question yes,

That's right, you must include them.

The district court in this particular case used

create exemptions from section 5 coverage.

Specifically, in Etowah County they held that

Insignificant or small changes still have the potential

For instance, the transfer of a polling place in

Perkins v. Matthews has the potential for — for

discrimination, and it has to be precleared whether the

of the authority rather than a transfer of the authority

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Our basic position in this case is that

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act applies to all changes

16

in election laws or practices but does not apply to

17

transfers of power or function among elected officials.

18

Now in drawing this line, I fully acknowledge that

19

transfers of authority among officials can be undertaken

20

for discriminatory reasons and can, in practice, affect

21

the ability of minority citizens in a particular district

22

or locale to influence the course of public policy.

to election laws.

8

focused on what happens to somebody who runs for office.

9

Justice Powell in his dissent there indicated he thought

It was a rule which specifically

10

it wasn't a change in election laws because it was a rule

11

that was passed through a personnel aspect of a school

12

board, but since it was a rule that said, here's what

13

happens to you when you run for office, it's certainly

14

consistent with the line I've drawn to say Dougherty

15

County affects voting, but transfers of authority don't

16

affect voting.

17

Transfers of authority instead, we believe,

should be governed not by section 5 with its particular

standards and procedures but by the conventional remedies

for other kinds of discrimination, if they are

That test is an effects test which says that any

17

Now, that's pretty strong medicine when we have Federal

Congress says is we're going to have this kind of

Government, and this limitation is perfectly sensible if

3

you look back at what it was that led Congress to single

4

out a minority of political jurisdictions in this country

5

and subject them to special regulation.

6

These were jurisdictions which back in the '60's

7

had large numbers of minority residents who weren't

8

registered to vote, so the problem that existed was one

9

with respect to the conduct of elections and voting, and

10

Congress addressed that problem in two ways in the Voting

11

Rights Act in 1965.
First, for these specific jurisdictions it

12

13

suspended all literacy tests and other devices that were

14

preventing people from registering to vote, and then in

15

section 5 what it did is it essentially froze in place the

16

balance of the electoral system that those jurisdictions

17

had.

18

literacy tests and other devices, and the rest of the

19

stuff has to stay the same, with one proviso, which was if

20

the jurisdiction could come forward and affirmatively

21

prove that there — that a change would be at least

22

neutral in its impact on the political influence of

23

minorities, then that change could go forward.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, and I -- and I

going to give public services to this segment of the

community because the people who live there are black, the

remedy is a lawsuit under the Fourteenth Amendment, and

the same would be true here if, with racist intent, a

elected by black constituents, or because he's black.

out of a three-judge court and come here as an appeal,

clear.

6

MR. SMITH:

Well, let me return for a moment, if

7

I might, to how this would get decided under the

8

substantive standard in section 5, which is a point that I

9

think is important.

10

This effects test does not limit Federal

11

interference to situations of actual, intentional

12

discrimination, which may have been the case in that Hardy

13

v. Wallace example.

14

transfers of power is, it prevents power from being

15

transferred for whatever reason from an official who is

16

subject to greater minority influence and control to an

17

official with less minority influence and control.

18

What it does if you apply it to

The only way that I can imagine that being

19

applied is — is to have a rule that says, if you've got

20

an official over here with a high percentage of minority

21

constituents and an official over here with fewer, you

22

simply cannot move power, under that effects test, from

23

the one official to the other.

24

would have to do if you tried to apply that kind of

25

substantive standard, which was designed for election

1

procedures, in this much broader context of transfers of

2

authority.

3

So, for example, just to give an example, if a

4

State had an existing arrangement under which total

5

control over the creation of school curricula was

6

delegated to local school districts and the State then,

7

for its own good and legitimate reasons, decided to take

8

back a chunk of that power and say — tell all the school

9

districts they have to teach science in all 4 years of

10

high school, or just set a State curriculum in the science

11

area, that would be the transfer of a chunk of authority

12

over school curricula from local officials subject to

13

local control to the State level.

14

The appellant's theory is not only that that

15

would have to be precleared — indeed, every time the

16

State changed whatever curricula requirements it has it

17

would have to be precleared — it would not only have to

18

be precleared, but in every case where the local school

19

district has more black residents than the State as a

20

whole, it would be prohibited from making that change,

21

because it would have the effect of transferring influence

22

over that policy decision from a smaller group of people

23

where blacks may predominate to a larger group of

24

people — the population of the whole State — where

25

blacks don't predominate.

So unless you're going to ignore the substantive
test that Congress set out in section 5, you're going to
end up with -- with results which are just so far beyond
what Congress could have imagined it was doing that they
call into question the entire statutory interpretation.
Going back just for a moment to the issue of the
frequency with which this happens, the school example, I
think, makes it clear that you're going to have a huge
number of cases in which State government will transfer
authority back and forth between the State level and the
local level.
Any time a State law addresses local government,
what they're doing is, they're saying you should zone in
this way, don't zone in this way, run your schools this
way, you're allowed to have cable television in your
county or you're not -- those kinds of things.

All of

that is a transfer of decision making authority.
It all may be phrased in different ways, but
ultimately if you're going to have a principle like this
you're going to have a huge number of laws like that, and
of course, at the local level the number of times that a
city council may tell the mayor what to do, or the county
commissioners may divide up their delegated executive
functions in Etowah County or Russell County are going
to — are going to be nearly infinite, and all of those

things would then be subject to this effects test and to a

2

preclearance process which is going to change the way

3

government is really conducted in these jurisdictions.

4

You're going to have to prepare this package of

5

stuff, send it in and wait 60 days for almost every law

that gets passed in order to be — be confident that

you're not going to be subject to legal challenge at some

Attorney General cannot clear it if — if it does fail the

Let's — the — the Attorney General

13

is required not to preclear it if it fails the effects

test, and then when the Attorney General says well, I'm

just not convinced on this, you don't have any

Is that

what happens?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

I do think that

the constitutional claim and perhaps the title VI claim
may be open.

I don't think the section 2 claim is open,

and I -- and I think it's pretty likely that the Fifteenth
Amendment claim doesn't work, but there is a Fourteenth
Amendment claim for sure, and that was pleaded from the
beginning, and the Court left that open.
Let me just make -- make one final point about
this question of how many things would be subject to legal
challenge.

There is no statute of limitations in

section 5.

If something is done that should have been

precleared and isn't, then it can be challenged at any
time thereafter, and if we look at how many things might
be viewed as involving some kind of transfer of
authority — and we have appellants here saying every
budget that's ever passed could be viewed in that way and
should be precleared — then we have to think about how
many things have been done in these jurisdictions since
1965 that now would be called into legal jeopardy if
appellants' and the Government's interpretation of the
statute were accepted.
Essentially, you'd have utter chaos in these
nine States and part of seven others that have been
operating under this statute for these years.

Whole

in innumerable ways as government has evolved, naturally,

4

over that period of time, and no one would have any idea

6

that out in court as people tried to figure out, does this

7

particular law in some way represent a redistribution of
