ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
For over 100 years this Court has steadfastly

11
12

adhered to what has become known as the Ker-Frisbie

13

doctrine.

14

is not impaired by the fact that an individual was

15

unlawfully brought before the court to stand trial.

16

Under that doctrine, the jurisdiction of courts

That doctrine has served as the backdrop for the

17

executive branch's negotiation of numerous extradition

18

treaties, including our treaty with Mexico.

19

involving the forcible abduction of an individual from

20

Mexico to stand trial in this country in connection with

21

the torture and death of special agent Enrique Camarena of

22

the Drug Enforcement Administration brings this doctrine

23

once again before the Court.

24
25

This case,

In this case, the lower courts concluded that
the Ker-Frisbie doctrine does not apply where there is an

extradition treaty in effect, the extradition treaty was

2

arguably violated by the abduction, and where the foreign

3

government protests the abduction.

4

QUESTION:

General Starr, as a preliminary

5

matter, has the State Department Legal Advisors' Office

6

joined your group?

7

MR. STARR:

The legal advisor is not on the

8

brief, but the brief expresses the views of the United

9

States, which includes the Department of State, and

10

Justice Blackmun, there should be no significance to the

11

fact that they are not shown on the brief.

12

advisor, Mr. Williamson has in fact opined that in his

13

view it is entirely appropriate and proper for courts to

14

exercise jurisdiction under circumstances such as these.

15
16

The Government speaks with one voice with
respect to this case.

Nothing formal to that effect,

however?

MR. STARR:

A letter or an opinion, that is

22

correct, but that is a customary way, Justice Blackmun, in

which the legal advisor expresses his views.

MR. STARR:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
Before you get into your argument,

3

why is this case a little different than some of the other

4

Ker-Frisbie cases, has the doctrine ever been applied to a

5

case involving the crime committed in another country by a

6

national of that country?

7
8

MR. STARR:

By a national of that country, I

believe the answer to that question is no.
QUESTION:

9
10

of first impression?

11

MR. STARR:

So this is a unique -- this is a case

The facts are different, yes, but I

12

think the doctrine itself, Justice Stevens, speaks quite

13

broadly to the courts, that it is the role of the courts

14

to try cases, and not to involve themselves with how the

15

individual came into the court.
QUESTION:

16
17

But in the Rauscher case, that is

discredited -MR. STARR:

18

Yes, because under that -- that is

19

exactly right, and I think that gets to the core of this

20

case.

21

Rauscher on the other.

22

Rauscher case examined very carefully the background of

23

the treaty, the Webster-Ashburton treaty --

25

The distinction between Ker on the one hand and

Justice Miller's opinion in the

that he was a fugitive and an American citizen, whereas

2

the facts here are much different.
MR. STARR:

The facts here are different, but

3

the point remains, Justice Stevens, that the doctrine

4

itself has been the broad doctrine that one simply does

5

not inquire into how - - the court does not inquire into

6

how the individual came there unless, and this is

7

Rauscher's point, there is a violation of a treaty.

8

9
10
11

A treaty is law.

It must be respected as law,

but here it is uncontested that there is no express
provision of the treaty that speaks to this - QUESTION:

But you do concede that if there were

12

a violation of the treaty, that the Court would not have

13

jurisdiction?

14

MR. STARR:

Depending on the precise terms of

15

the treaty, I don't want to speak so broadly as to say any

16

violation might give rise to a divesting of jurisdiction.

17

But certainly if we had a situation where, as in the

18

Rauscher case, there is a clear treaty provision, the

19

doctrine of specialty, well-understood, discussed at great

20

length indeed.

21

of our treaty with Mexico.

22

if a state is going to perform an official act and render

23

a fugitive over, then that state has an interest in that

24

individual only be charged with a crime that has been laid

25

at his feet.

That doctrine finds its way into the text
It is quite well-settled that

But note that in Rauscher, the only relief for

2

Rauscher in contrast to the situation here, was that he

3

had to be tried for murder and not for cruel and unusual

4

punishment.

5
6

7
8

There was no requirement that Rauscher be
returned to the United Kingdom where he had found asylum.
QUESTION:

He would have to return before he

could be tried for cruel and unusual punishment.
MR. STARR:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. STARR:

He might have to be -If he is -Before he is tried for a crime other

12

than that for which the nation rendered him over.

13

this is a very important aspect of this case:

14

extent does the extradition treaty operate exclusively

15

with respect to our relationships with Mexico, and I think

16

it is vitally important for me to make one point:

17

the extradition treaty is a tool, it is a valuable tool,

18

but it is only a tool.

1

I think

to what

that

We deal with the Government of Mexico quite

20

informally.

There are numerous instances of informal

21

renditions of individuals outside the treaty terms.

22

have been instances where there have been informal

23

renditions of individuals where it would appear that to

24

extradite them might run afoul of the terms of the treaty,

25

and Mexico therefore chooses, for political reasons,

QUESTION:

2

It is perfectly clear, there is no

3

precedent for our kidnapping a foreign national when that

4

national's country is asserting jurisdiction.

5

MR. STARR:

There is no case that involves those

6

specific facts, Justice Stevens.

I think that I concede

7

to you.

8

in any way is compromised by the point that the individual

What I do not concede is that the insight of Ker

happens to be a foreign national, and when the Court
10

thinks as to the circumstances that might well arise,

11

terrorism, narcotrafficking, there may very well be

12

circumstances when it is the sober judgment of the United

13

States Government that extraordinary action is required.

14

And that is a matter that is entrusted in this

15

Court, speaking initially through Chief Justice Marshall

16

in the Head Money cases and in the Ship Richmond case said

17

these are issues ultimately for the political branches.

If the - -

QUESTION:

General Starr, is it any less a

20

violation of international law to kidnap a foreign

21

national from a foreign country than an American national

22

from a foreign country?

MR. STARR:

to go in and just snatch people from foreign countries

without their consent?
MR. STARR:

2

I think it certainly could be

3

maintained that as Mexico can reasonably maintain, that

4

there was a violation of Mexico's sovereignty, and in your

5

hypothetical, certainly a violation of sovereignty.
What I don't want to readily concede, Justice

6

7

Scalia, is that a violation of sovereignty is necessarily

8

a violation of international law, of customary

9

international law.
QUESTION:

10
11

That isn't the point I am making.

Whether it is a violation --

12

MR. STARR:

13

QUESTION:

Correct.
--of Mexico's sovereignty depends

14

upon whether the person snatched was a Mexican citizen or

15

not.
MR. STARR:

16
17

The answer is no.

It is the

territorial integrity that would have been compromised.
QUESTION:

18

And indeed, an American national

19

might have more cause to complain about the violation of

20

international law by his country than a Mexican national

21

might.

22

MR. STARR:

It is certainly clear from the

23

standpoint of the Nation that its sovereignty has been

24

violated, and that is a very serious matter.

Justice Marshall in Ship Richmond said that is a matter

2

cases he said this is a matter that may entail the most

3

delicate kind of contretemps between nations, including

4

the possibility of hostilities, but of this, the courts

5

are to have no cognizance.
QUESTION:

6

Indeed, in the Head Money-

General Starr, historically, has the

7

situation ever been reversed, where Mexico has come and

8

raided us and taken someone?

the days of Pancho Villa.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. STARR:

I am old enough to remember

There are in fact episodes, in fact,

12

at footnote 23 of our opening brief we do recount a

13

situation which is quite similar to that.
QUESTION:

14
15
16

What would this country do if it

happened?
MR. STARR:

But in terms of what this country

17

would do, in fact, what we saw in the Sidney Chaffee case

18

I think is quite illustrative.

19

and kidnap a Canadian businessman and bring him to the

20

United States to stand trial.

21

Individuals go into Canada

It would not be our position, Justice Blackmun,

22

that notwithstanding the affront to Canada's sovereignty

23

or to Mexico's sovereignty or to the United States'

24

sovereignty, that the courts of those countries were

25

divested of jurisdiction.

That is the narrow point that

1

we are making, that these are matters that are entrusted

2

to the political branches through the diplomatic process,

3

to examine and to explore and to resolve.

4

QUESTION:

Do we decide this case, General

5

Starr, on the assumption that there has been a violation

6

of international law?

7

MR. STARR:

I don't think that you need to

8

assume that there has been a violation of international

9

law, but we are prepared, Justice Kennedy, to say that,

10

assuming arguendo that there was, nonetheless, the

11

Government's position should prevail.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Do you concede that there is a

violation of international law?
MR. STARR:

I do not concede that there is a

15

violation of international law but for purposes of

16

argument, I am prepared to say that if there were a

17

violation of international law, still Ker-Frisbie applies,

18

just as it applies when there is a violation of the

19

Constitution of the United States.

MR. STARR:

Well, Justice Stevens, I have to

respectfully disagree that there was at least a violation

of Peruvian sovereignty by virtue of - - as the Court has

described this case --

7

MR. STARR:

But he did not have asylum status, he

But he was nonetheless, and this

Court -- when I read the Court's opinion in Ker it does
not place any emphasis at all or any significance on that

10

individual's status as an American citizen and as a

11

fugitive --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. STARR:

--at that point could have -But Rauscher, again, talks about the

14

point, and we have no quarrel with that as embodied, as

15

reflected in the fact that the extradition treaty with

16

Mexico incorporates the specialty principle, but that is a

17

narrow principle - -

18

QUESTION:

-- it has the distinction between

1

Mexican nationals and those who are not Mexican

20

nationals --

21

MR. STARR:

Yes, it does, and in fact, I think

22

that is a very important point.

One of the reasons,

23

Justice Stevens, that it is somewhat impracticable to

24

proceed under the extradition treaty is that Mexico has no

25

obligation to extradite its nationals.

will and does.

The Government of Mexico has never

2

extradited one of its nationals under the terms of an

3

extradition treaty.

4

It has done so in --

5

QUESTION:

But, General Starr, the treaty in

6

Article 9 does say that if Mexico doesn't extradite one of

7

its own nationals, that nevertheless, the United States

8

can require Mexico to prosecute the person there.

9
10

MR. STARR:

There is no question we have a right

under Article 9.2 to have it submitted -QUESTION:

11

My concern, frankly, is that it is

12

not so clear to me that the extradition treaty doesn't

13

contemplate that that is the exclusive process to be

14

followed.

15

designated offenses, including murder, extradition shall

16

take place subject to the treaty, and if you look at

17

Article 9 which says the country doesn't have to yield up

18

its own nationals, but will have to prosecute, I think one

19

could come away thinking the treaty covers this case.

20

When you read Article 2, that says for the

MR. STARR:

I think with all respect that would

21

be a misimpression.

legal backdrop of our negotiation, Justice O'Connor, of

throughout the world, but certainly by the courts of this

2

Nation as meaning that courts are not divested of

3

jurisdiction even if there is an unlawful abduction.

4

But now let me move to the treaty.

5

I think, with all respect, that represents an

6

overreading of the treaty.

speaks in terms of requesting, the party requesting and

8

invoking the treaty.

The treaty in various terms

If I leave nothing else with the Court other

be violated.

QUESTION:

But isn't that always possible, that

16

parties to a treaty, like parties to a contract, can agree

17

to some other specific arrangement?

18

MR. STARR:

Yes, and it's one of the reasons why

19

individuals should not be seen as having enforceable

20

rights under this particular treaty.

21

the practice that is embodied in the treaty at Rauscher,

22

this is a treaty that should not be seen as giving rise to

1

enforceable rights that they -MR. STARR:

2

Well certainly, it can be argued

3

that if there is a violation of the treaty -- but my point

4

is a very important and narrow one here, which is this

5

treaty was crafted with this backdrop in mind of

6

Ker-Frisbie.

7

what has been suggested by the other side, then there was

8

a very readily available tool; the Harvard Project, in

9

1935, crafted a proposed insertion in extradition

10

And if, if what we wanted to accomplish was

treaties, article 16, this is referred to in the briefs.
That's quite clear that the Court shall not

11
12

proceed under those circumstances.

There is nothing here

13

at all in the treaty itself about the courts being

14

divested of jurisdiction.

15

extraordinary for the Court to conclude that it's all

16

right to proceed with the prosecution if there's been a

17

violation of the Constitution of the United States, but a

18

violation, at most accepting the other side's submission,

reason.

We would not readily accede to such a limitation

2

on the ability of the executive branch under various

3

circumstances to proceed by other means; and certainly not

4

to give an argument or a right to an individual to say, I

5

do not have to face these serious charges against me by

virtue of my reading of an implied obligation in the

MR. STARR:

Just to -And unless we were willing to

No, you finish your sentence.
Unless we were willing to enter into

a Webster-Ashburton type treaty and then bind ourselves

with respect to the doctrine of specialty.

15

that here, but that's all that we have done.

16

QUESTION:

We've done

So it would be -- it would be correct

17

to say that in no presently operative extradition treaty

18

of the United States there is any express bar to the

United States' resort to some means other than extradition

20

to get the person back.

21

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

That is true.
Okay.

Is it -- may I ask you another

23

treaty question?

Your brief on page 32 refers both the

U.N. charter and to the OAS charter, which the court of

appeals referred to.

the terms of either of those charters?
MR. STARR:

2

No, we would not concede that they

3

do.

We certainly do understand the point of the

4

Government of Mexico that its sovereignty was violated,

5

but by virtue -- the record is not terribly extensive in

6

this case, but footnote 2 at least adumbrates briefly the

7

background.

8

followed on the heels of informal discussions with

That is to say, no DEA agents were in the

10

representatives of the Government of Mexico.

11

in fact, physically intrude directly into the territorial

12

integrity of the Government of Mexico, but we do not

13

suggest that these were not our agents.

We did not,

But in terms of whether there was a violation or

14
15

not of the U.N. charter and the like, I think the law is

16

clear, Justice Souter, that that does not give rise to

17

That's right.
Do you think you can compare two

was kidnapped by Mexican authorities and brought back into

10

Mexico on the one hand.

11

and apprehended an American citizen in Texas and took him

to Mexico.

be more offended by the kidnapping of the American citizen

as contrasted with the Mexican fugitive?

court not to try a case just because of an unlawful

of divesting the Court of jurisdiction is too heavy a cost

16

and it also, quite frankly in my judgment, tranches on

separation of powers concerns, especially when the order

Mr.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1

MR. HOFFMAN:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

This case does depend on a choice between the

5

line of authority that begins with Ker v. Illinois and the

6

line of authority that begins with United States v.

7

Rauscher, and in the line of authority starting with

8

United States v. Rauscher, this Court has made it clear on

9

several occasions, an unbroken chain of occasions, in

10

Johnson v. Brown, in the Ford case, in United States v.

11

Cook, that the jurisdiction of the United States, the

12

authority of the United States can be limited by treaty

13

obligations.

14

That is the basic principle of Rauscher and

15

Rauscher really stands as an answer to all of the

16

arguments that the Government has made in this case.

17

the Rauscher case, there was no explicit rule of

18

specialty, in the Webster-Ashburton treaty of 1842, nor

19

was there any explicit mention that a violation of the

20

rule of specialty would limit the jurisdiction of the

21

Court.

22

In

In fact, in that case there had been a

23

conviction of somebody.

Mr. Rauscher had been convicted.

24

He was physically before the Court, and yet this Court

25

decided that our international obligations under the

1

Webster-Ashburton treaty were more important and the Court

2

found that in the language of the treaty, in the manifest

3

purpose and object of the treaty, the Court had to find

4

that there was a rule of specialty, and the Court did not

5

defer to the executive branch version of that rule of

6

specialty.

7

In fact, there had been a diplomatic controversy

8

raging between the United States and Great Britain for

9

more than a decade on this very point, and the British

10

Government had made its position very clear that a rule of

11

specialty was required because of the background rule of

12

customary law that the parties had to have intended by

13

creating the language that they created in the treaty,

14

which is the same argument that we make here.

15

The Government of Mexico has made it very clear

16

that they understood, as Canada understood, that

17

extradition treaties, when they place specific limits on

18

how people can be rendered, mean that.

19

article 9, with respect to obtaining the presence of a

20

Mexican national before this Court.

21

that was made, and in the context of that treaty and its

22

purpose and the entire structure of it, it must mean that

23

the United States is not free to kidnap Mexican nationals

24

to circumvent that.

MR. HOFFMAN:

2

Justice White,

it would be our

3

view based on the language of the treaty, its purpose and

4

the fact that it is the exclusive means, that Americans

5

should not be kidnapped consistent with this treaty

6

either, because the limitations, for example, on the

7

political offense doctrine and the other limitations in

8

the treaty also, we believe, should lead a court to

9

conclude that kidnapping to circumvent those limitations

10

would also be a violation of the treaty.
But with respect to article 9, it is different.

11
12

There are very few cases of kidnapping, there are very few

13

cases - - there are no cases of kidnapping of a national in

14

the Ker-Frisbie line that the Government argues is a

15

backdrop.

16

with respect to Mexican nationals, as Judge Browning in

17

the Verdugo case in the Ninth Circuit found that one could

18

base a decision, a court could base a decision on

19

article 9 that there was a specific arrangement, but our

20

belief is that --

are in favor of the proposition that a person who has been

Rauscher was a good reason.

Justice Scalia, I think that the

13

principle in Rauscher is that the court may find an

14

inherent provision that's not specifically stated.

15

case is not a case based on the rule of specialty, but

16

it's based on an even more fundamental rule, and the

17

Court's analysis in Rauscher certainly would permit this

Court to look to the background rules of customary law; as

1

they did in Rauscher, it would look to the history, where

this country of self-execution, of the notion that
extradition treaties are self-executing, and extradition
treaties serve different purposes.
To be sure they serve the purposes of mutual
cooperation and law enforcement, but they also serve the
purpose of protecting sovereign interest and they serve
the purpose of protecting individual interest and that has
been understood in the cases from the very beginning which
have given individuals the rights to claim interests which
are really sovereign rights too.
In this particular case, the sovereign rights
and the individual rights are almost identical, and they
coincide in the sense that for a Mexican national, Mexico
owes a duty to the respondent in this case to protect him
and offer the benefits of Mexican law, and so when they
are asserting their sovereign interests to prevent the
United States from circumventing this treaty and bringing
him to the United States they are also protecting his
interests.
The interests are really in the same alignment
in this case and under Rauscher and Johnson and cases
before and after that, individuals have been given the
right to claim benefits under treaties.

One of the ways to look at it, I suppose, is

that the U.S. position would be that if they had asked for

extradite Dr. Alvarez-Machain, what we will do is try him

knew about the case or not?
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, Chief Justice Rehnquist, if

this Court were to find that Ker stands for a broad
principle that notwithstanding treaty obligations a court
should try the person who comes before it no matter how
that person comes before it, then obviously the treaty
would not, well, it would apply.
QUESTION:

What you're saying then is that the

holding of Ker, the teaching, whatever you want to call
it, has not been understood in the international community
as broadly as the Government is saying it has?
MR. HOFFMAN:

That's correct, and I don't think

it's been understood by lower court cases.

Now there is

some broad language about what Ker means, but the cases, I
think, have been very careful to distinguish between the
different situations that point out the absence of protest
and I think that the Rauscher line stands for an equally
important line of authority and policy interest.
What this Court said in Johnson v. Brown was
that treaty obligations, the enforcement in good faith of
treaty obligations is of vital importance to the Nation,

about the text of the treaty?

Article 17 does have the

rule of specialty and it's spelled out in careful detail.

Was that a customary provision in extradition treaties

before the Rauscher decision?

QUESTION:

The opinion itself doesn't refer to

3

any such provision in the treaty, and I had assumed that

4

they had implied that that was just a fair way to read the

5

treaty, that if we followed the procedure --

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

My understanding, and certainly

7

the Justice Friendly decision in Fiacani would suggest,

8

that principles of international comity would require the

9

same result, that if someone is handed over informally as

10

sovereign nations have the right to do that that principle

11

would still obtain, that essentially what has happened is

12

that the State that has handed the person over has

13

essentially given up a sovereign right to give that person

14

asylum, and so the authority is limited in terms of

15

prosecution to what - - to that piece of sovereignty that

16

the Government has given up.

17

And I think that extradition treaties have to be

18

read in the context of those sovereign interests that this

19

Court has recognized from the beginning of its work.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Hoffman, certainly the Court in

21

Frisbie read Ker very broadly.

It said this Court has

22

never departed from the rule announced in Ker that the

power of a court to try a person for a crime is not

impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the

MR. HOFFMAN:

1

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

that's true.

Frisbie reads that very broadly in that

3

context, but the Frisbie context is very different.

4

the extradition clause within the United States, for

5

example, there is no right -- sovereign right that one

6

State has to delay or deny extradition to another, and so

there are no sovereign issues there, and the question is

8

whether the due process clause may be used to remedy that

9

kind of police conduct.
QUESTION:

10

Under

But if you're right that the fact

11

that it was a governmental kidnapping is important, there

12

was -- it's a governmental kidnapping in Frisbie, too.
MR. HOFFMAN:

13

Well, but the reason that it's

14

important because it's a governmental kidnapping is that

15

it invokes our treaty obligations.
QUESTION:

Why should the treaty obligations be

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

Constitution is more important from our standpoint as

22

Americans than treaties, but treaties have been very

23

important to this country's history, and I think this

and that those limitations must be fulfilled, and it's not

2

just because it's a treaty obligation, it's because those

3

treaty obligations are part of a web of international

4

relationships that are essential to this country, and have

5

been thought to be essential to this country from the

6

beginning of time.

7

QUESTION:

That really doesn't distinguish them

8

from a constitutional principle.

9

a treaty is subordinate to the Constitution.
MR. HOFFMAN:

10

In fact, as you concede,

But the Constitution does -- was

11

found in Frisbie not to place limits of that kind.

It was

12

found that the due process clause, which was the clause

13

that was relied upon in Frisbie, was found to be satisfied

14

by giving that person a fair trial.
Moreover, the only -- I think in the Frisbie

15
16

type case there's a kind of inherent futility.

send the person back as a remedy for that violation the

person will be back again, so unless you actually

MR. HOFFMAN:

5

No, but the point is that it will

fact in this case the policies of Frisbie are satisfied to

8

some degree because Mexico will agree to prosecute.
Mexico has stated to this Court that it will

9
10

live up to its obligations under Article 92, and it's

11

given the Court very good reason for believing that that's

12

true, and so the underlying policies of Ker-Frisbie about

immunity from prosecution don't apply because Mexico will

prosecute, and that's the bargain that the United States

Does it mean Mexico can prosecute if

What it means is that Mexico
