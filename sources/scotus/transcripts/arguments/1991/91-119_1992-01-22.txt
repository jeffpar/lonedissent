ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. THOMAS CREERON, III
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CREERON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

The question presented in this case is whether

14

for the 6-year period at issue the respondent engaged in

15

activities other than those expressly permitted by Public

16

Law 86-272, thereby forfeiting the limited immunity from

17

State taxation measured by income, which is accorded by

18

that statute.

19

respondent did engage in activities other than those

20

expressly permitted, that its assessment covering that

21

period is valid, and that the judgment of the Wisconsin

22

Supreme Court should therefore be reversed.

23

It is Wisconsin's position that the

This case arose as a result of a franchise tax

24

assessment made by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue

25

against the William Wrigley, Jr., Company, which is the

The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed the

10

Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission solely on the legal

11

question of how it construed the provisions of Public Law

12

86-272, and agreed with the construction of that statute

13

that Wrigley continues to advocate here.

14

QUESTION:

Was that a unanimous opinion?

15

MR. CREERON:

16

This Court's decision in Heublein established

Yes, it was.

17

two firm tenets for construing Public Law 86-272.

18

Congress must speak clearly when it chooses to abridge the

19

State's taxing powers, which of course are fundamental to

20

their very existence.

21

ambiguous terms in the statute will be construed in favor

22

of the preexisting authority to tax.

Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission would probably be

2

sufficient to support taxation under the principles set

3

forth by the Court in Heublein, the major activities

4

engaged in by Wrigley, which we claim exceeded those

5

listed in the statute, are maintaining stocks of goods in

6

rented warehouse space in Wisconsin and in its employees'

7

homes in Wisconsin; replacing stale or damaged product

8

from that stock of goods; direct agency stock check sales

9

and direct delivery of product from that stock of goods;

10

and personnel management and similar activities engaged in

11

by Wrigley's resident regional manager, which did not

12

involve any customer participation.

It may approve

orders, it may fill orders, and it may deliver goods to

the customer.

3

Wrigley shipped fresh gum, carried on its books

4

as inventory, to a warehouse and to its employees' homes

5

in Wisconsin.

6

and most of it remained in storage at these locations.

7

Once that gum was in Wisconsin, it is our position that it

8

became a stock of goods within the State.

9
10
11

That gum was not shipped to the customer,

QUESTION:

That was the only instance, wasn't

it?
MR. CREERON:

The only shipment of goods other

12

than to the customer was to the warehouse and to its

13

employees' homes, yes.

No, it was -- they rented

time period the annual cost was no more than $300 a month.
QUESTION:

2

When you say they did, I thought it

3

was one salesman did, right?

4

officers of the company knew about that?

5

MR. CREERON:

Do we know that other

Yes, the record clearly reflects

6

that the regional manager in 1973 obtained permission from

7

Wrigley to rent the warehouse, and was assured by Wrigley

8

that he would in fact be reimbursed for those warehouse

9

costs.

Then when an employee was finally hired and the --

10

he lived in an apartment, the stock of gum would not fit

11

within his apartment, he continued that arrangement, and

12

he also was assured by Wrigley that he would be reimbursed

13

for those costs.

14

did not approve of this particular activity.

15

So I don't think Wrigley can say that it

Once the gum was in these in-State locations,

16

Wrigley's sales representatives would use that gum, travel

17

around to dealer locations, and would fill display stands

18

at the retailer's location.

19

the correct sizes of product, the sales representative

20

would swap product with the retailer, and place the

21

different sizes of product in the display stand.

22

position that that activity constituted delivery of goods

23

from within the State.

25

If the retailer did not have

1

correct size of product, the sales representative could

2

not do the necessary product swapping, and the sales

3

representative would then provide gum to the retailer

4

through a device known as an agency stock check.

5

that would work was that the stock check would be given to

6

the retailer as a receipt, the wholesaler would bill the

7

retailer, and Wrigley would then bill the wholesaler.

8

Since billing did occur in these situations, it's our

9

position that a sale did take place.

The way

Therefore, both

10

approval and delivery of these agency stock check

11

transactions occurred in Wisconsin.

12

unambiguous meaning of the statutory terminology prohibits

13

this product swapping and these agency stock check

14

transactions.

15

The plain and

The statute does permit certain business

16

activity within a State that would otherwise have

17

jurisdiction to tax, but its language immediately limits

18

the phrase "business activity" in such a way that the only

19

activity of that kind that may originate within the State

20

must constitute solicitation of orders.

21

unambiguous meaning of the term "only" is that nothing

22

else may occur.

23

decision, with which Wrigley appears to agree in every

24

respect, holds that the ordinary and accepted meaning of

25

the term "solicit" is to make a plea.

The plain and

And the Wisconsin Supreme Court's

The ordinary and

(800) FOR DEPO

1

accepted meaning of the term "solicitation of orders"

2

therefore, is simply requesting orders.

3

Even if solicitation were determined to be an

4

ambiguous term, its possible meanings can be placed on a.

5

spectrum.

6

orders within the State would be permissible, and any

7

other activity would result in payment of a fairly

8

apportioned tax.

At one end, simply requesting and receiving

9

At the other end of that spectrum, lease or

10

ownership of physical facilities or the presence of a

11

stock of goods would be prohibited, and every other

12

activity conducted within a State which would otherwise

13

have jurisdiction to tax, would nevertheless be tax

14

exempt.

15

Every presumption in Heublein is in favor of

16

that end of the spectrum, where only requesting orders is

17

permissible.

18

Wrigley's burden to establish that the court should move

19

away from that end of the spectrum any distance at all is

20

enormous.

21

"solicitation" to include what it claims are incidental

22

activities is at the exact opposite end of the spectrum

23

from its ordinary and accepted meaning.

24
25

Under the Court's decision in that case,

with that.

MR. CREERON:

6

That even you concede there may

We, the Wisconsin Department of

7

Revenue, did not apply the narrowest test that is applied

8

in some States, but it is our position that the activity

9

must be part and parcel of the sales pitch.

That may be

10

slight --a slightly different definition than saying that

11

all you can do is ask for the order, but -QUESTION:

12

How about restocking the gum at

13

the -- you know, at the same call would you ask him to buy

14

some more?

It's our position that you can't

do that.

That serves another purpose.

than solicitation.
QUESTION:

Well, it could be seen as part of the

20

overall solicitation, saying this is the kind of service

21

that we routinely perform and therefore you ought to deal

22

with us.

23

MR. CREERON:

Well, the statute, first of all,

24

only protects the sale of tangible personal property.

25

does not protect the provision of services.

But it's the sale

that enhances the chances of making the sale can be done

and fall within the exemption?

But presumably do you take the position that nothing

MR. CREERON:

6

Not at all.

We take the position

7

that if the activity is part and parcel of, inextricably

8

bound, whatever terminology along those lines you chose to

9

use, part of the sales pitch itself, that the activity is

10

permissible.

11

useful in regard to the replacement of damaged goods

12

because I think what that test is trying to get at is that

13

you can't do more simply because the first sale or many

14

sales have taken place.

15

customer who had never done business with you before, you

16

would not be in a position to replace damaged goods, which

17

I think indicates that that activity is something that is

18

beyond the sales pitch itself.

19

The pre-sale/post-sale test, I think, is

QUESTION:

The first time you approach a

Mr. Creeron, suppose you have a

20

salesman who makes his presentation to the customer, the

21

customer buys some gum, and then the customer says, but

22

I'm telling you now, I'm not going to place another order

23

unless you forward to the company and support these

24

complaints that I have about the company - - about the last

25

shipment.

Now I want you do that for me.

That would render the

I don't believe that activity does

you approach the customer.

So that activity does not fit

within our definition.
QUESTION:

I don't believe complaint

taxable?

13

MR. CREERON:' Yes.

14

QUESTION:

But surely solicitation includes not

15

just the first time you approach the company, but

16

approaches thereafter to keep their sales going?

17
18
19

MR. CREERON:

Absolutely.

You can do the same

things the second time, the third time.
QUESTION:

And if you're back the third time,

20

and the customer said I've really got these complaints

21

about the first two batches that I bought, forward them to

22

the manufacturer, the salesman cannot do that without

23

going beyond solicitation in your view?

quality control service, and that that is -- that is not

Supreme Court as I remember it was it was de minimis, that

it if it had been a routine -- major part of the, you

know, regular storage of stuff that's delivered, it would

be different.

9

And if you don't -- or if you do, why doesn't this come

And the answer of the Wisconsin

Do you recognize any de minimis exception?

within it?
MR. CREERON:

11

We absolutely do not recognize any

12

de minimis exception.

We feel that that's inconsistent

13

with the word "only" that Congress used in this particular

14

statute.

15

Senator Byrd, the sponsor of the bill, in the

16

Congressional Record at 16355 says that the sale of a

17

single sample within the State would result in a

18

forfeiture of immunity under the bill.

19

you're going to apply that logic to warehouse rental, the

20

rental of a single warehouse or a small amount of

21

warehouse space would also result in a forfeiture of

22

immunity under the statute.

And if you look in the legislative history,

QUESTION:

MR. CREERON:

It seems that if

Maybe Senator Byrd was wrong.

9

MR. CREERON:
QUESTION:

10

And whenever you have a de minimis

You'd have a regular exception.
Well.

So all you say is this is

11

categorical.

12

you have de minimis exceptions from all prescriptions, or

13

almost all, anyway.

14

But every prescription is categorical and

MR. CREERON:

The plain an unambiguous meaning

15

of the term "only" means that, and it's our position,

16

anyway, that Congress did not want a de minimis exception

17

QUESTION:

square.

7

MR. CREERON:

If you're renting physical plant

8

within a State, it's our position that that is not

9

permissible with any unambiguous language of the statute.
QUESTION:

10

Can you pay a taxicab to carry these

11

samples?

I mean, let's say a taxicab charges for

12

suitcases, and you put the samples of suitcases in the

13

trunk of the cab to show it.

14

MR. CREERON:

15

QUESTION:

That's out, too?

No, absolutely you can do that.

Well, why can you do it?

Why is that

16

any different from storing the samples?

17

to me everything that you would reasonably be expected to

18

do with samples ought to be okay if the samples -- if

giving the samples are okay.

MR. CREERON:

3

I'm saying you can't put it in a

warehouse, which is what happened here.

4

QUESTION:

Can you engage in activities to

5

stimulate sales, since the ultimate purpose of doing that

6

is of course to stimulate orders?

7

MR. CREERON:

You can engage in the sales pitch

8

itself.

If by that you mean that is any activity which

9

would generate additional profits permissible, we take the

10

position that that activity is not allowed under the

11

unambiguous language of the statute.

12

QUESTION:

If the salesman arrives for the first

13

time at a store and says we'll give you all of these

14

posters to display in the store that advertise the virtues

15

of the gum, pictures of the twins, and so on, is that

16

impermissible?

17

MR. CREERON:

No, I believe you can do that.

18

don't see what other purpose that activity would have,

19

that that activity would be inextricably bound up in the

20

sales pitch itself.

21

QUESTION:

What about renting newspaper space

for advertising in local papers or renting radio time?

MR. CREERON:

Well, I don't know if I would look

at it in those terms.

If there is a problem with

advertising, it would be, I think, that the statute only

10

allows solicitation of the customer and the customer's

12

would be called third-tier solicitation where you're

have here is all of Wrigley's orders or business in

Are there any cases that you rely on

for the proposition that there's a de minimis exception in

for you, but I gave the example, Your Honor, of the Abbott

Yeah, but the argument is that you

MR. PRETTYMAN:

â€¢REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF F. THOMAS CREERON

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

Thank you, Mr. Prettyman.

MR. CREERON:

On the de minimis exemption, the

16

word "only" is what gives the statute its character

17

protecting small business.

18

you say that's de minimis, a small business who comes into

19

the State and makes that same $600 of sales, and it's

20

their total sales, loses out under the statute.

21

totally at odds with the'statutory purpose of protecting

22

small business.

If you make $600 of sales, and

Because a small business could make de minimis

mistakes, too, and be protected.

What I'm saying is if there's a de

minimis exception, the small business will get the benefit

8

of it as much as the big business.

MR. CREERON:

But how do you determine what the

de minimis exemption is?

I mean, they have no definition

12

QUESTION:

Well, that's another problem.

But I

13

just don't buy your argument that it's loaded one way or

14

another based on the size of the company.

15

don't understand it on that basis.

16

MR. CREERON:

At least I

But I mean, a small business

17

couldn't claim a de minimis exemption if all its $600 of

18

sales involve direct delivery.

19

me that that removes the character of the statute of

20

protecting small business.

You know I -- it seems to

Also, the statute was designed to protect those

corporations that couldn't afford attorneys and
