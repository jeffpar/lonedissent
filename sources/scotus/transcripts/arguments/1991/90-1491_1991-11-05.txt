ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. GRAHAM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRAHAM:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is the proper

12

13

interpretation and application of section 547(c)(2) of the

14

Bankruptcy Code.

15

statutory limitations on a bankruptcy trustee's right to

16

recover payments from creditors, and it protects ordinary

17

course of business payments.

18

Section 547(c)(2) is one of several

The plain meaning of the statute exempts all

19

ordinary course payments, and the statute does not limit

20

its protection to any particular class or type of

21

creditor.

22

result in this case, because this is not one of those rare

23

cases where the literal words of the statute are in

24

conflict with congressional intent.

We submit that the statute must control the

1

very straightforward plain meaning case, because what is

2

different in this case, as opposed to some of the other

3

court cases, is that Congress amended the statute and

4

deleted a specific time restriction which was contained in

5

the 1 78 Bankruptcy Code.

6

payments were only protected if they were made within 45

7

days of when the debt was incurred.

QUESTION:

Mr. Graham, before you get into the

10

legislative history of the prior statute, sticking for the

11

moment with the plain language of the statute, how big was

12

this loan?

13

MR. GRAHAM:

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18

$7 million.
And are $7 million loans, borrowings,

made in the ordinary course of business?
MR. GRAHAM:

Yes, for Union Bank, which is a

large commercial lender - QUESTION:

No, but for the -- is it the ordinary

1

course of business for the bank or the ordinary course of

20

business of the borrower?

21

22
23

MR. GRAHAM:

The statute requires it to be in

the ordinary course of both the borrower and the lender.
QUESTION:

No, but my question is, is it the

24

ordinary course of this borrower to make $7 million

25

unsecured loans?

Isn't that the -- under plain language,

1

isn't that the issue for us -- or one of the issues?
MR. GRAHAM:

2

That would be a factual issue that

3

would need to be determined in the trial court.

4

this - QUESTION:

5

It is

If this is the only loan of this

6

magnitude it had ever made, and never borrowed more than

7

$1,000 before, what would you say?
MR. GRAHAM:

8

9
10
11

Then I would say that as to that

particular corporation or business' operation it was not
ordinary.
But the statute in this case, was determined by

12

the Ninth Circuit not to apply to any long-term

13

(inaudible).

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GRAHAM:

I understand.

I understand that.

I do agree with Your Honor that

16

there is a standard of ordinariness that must be analyzed

17

on a factual basis.

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Both with respect to incurring the

debt, and also with respect to the payments.
MR. GRAHAM:

That's correct, and I would

21

turn -- just for example -- to Black's Law Dictionary that

22

says something that is ordinary is normal and customary,

23

and not characterized by peculiar or unusual

24

circumstances.

25

QUESTION:

On that same point, suppose there

were a balloon payment, that this was a loan with monthly

2

principal and interest payments.

3

balloon payment made just before bankruptcy, according to

4

the terms of the note?
MR. GRAHAM:

5

Suppose there's a

Then I believe that if it was

6

customary for that type of debtor to borrow money and pay

7

by balloon payment, that it would not be considered to be

8

unusual and out of the ordinary course.
QUESTION:

9
10

The test is what is customary for the

particular business?
MR. GRAHAM:

11

Yes, I think there would have to be

12

an analysis both of - - both of what occurs in the

13

industry, and possibly what was proper and appropriate to

14

this particular business -- for instance, measuring their

15

net worth, and an examination of their balance sheet at

16

that time.

17

QUESTION:

Let's assume a small business that

18

incurs a substantial loan at the outset of the business to

19

purchase the real estate in which the business operates.

20

You'd say that payments made off -- made on that initial

21

loan, which is far and away greater than any other debt

22

the business incurred - - that would not be allowable

23

because it's not in the ordinary course?

MR. GRAHAM:

No, I -- in answering the other

Justice's question, I thought what I was saying is you

would have to test it from a factual circumstance, by

2

examining the particular business.
QUESTION:

3

For --

Well, the particular business, this

4

is the only loan of that magnitude it ever took out.

5

that's standard for a lot of small businesses.

MR. GRAHAM:

QUESTION:

8

business, you say.

And I would agree
So it isn't just the particular

It's businesses in general.

MR. GRAHAM:

9

But

I would agree with your point.

10

instance, many individuals only take out one, large

11

mortgage to buy their home.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GRAHAM:

Of course.
Yet that would not be considered to

14

be unusual for that particular individual to buy a home

15

and incur a large amount of debt for his personal

16

residence.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

For

Quite so.

And I think it would be

the same for a business, wouldn't it?
MR. GRAHAM:

Yes, I agree, so long as that

20

particular business, for instance, let's say, only needed

21

one large working capital loan.

22

businesses of that type also needed one working capital

23

loan, I don't think that that makes it unusual or out of

24

the ordinary.

25

So long as other

But the problem in this case is that the

decision of the court below ruled, as a matter of law,
that no long-term lender was entitled to protections of
the statute -- I don't think because they concluded that
it was out of the ordinary course of business.

They did

not make a factual determination that this particular loan
was out of the ordinary course of business.

They simply

concluded, on what a -- we submit is a very, inadequate
legislative history, that Congress could not have possibly
intended to extend the protection of this statute to long­
term lenders.
The critical language of the statute, which I
think the Court obviously needs to focus on, is as
follows, quote,

"a debt incurred by the debtor in the

ordinary course of business or financial affairs."
And we submit that there really is no reason for
this Court to qualify the word "debt," or to guess at
legislative intent as to what Congress meant by the word
"debt."

And that is because debt is a statutorily defined

term in the Bankruptcy Code, and it means liability on a
claim -- which surely includes long-term lenders.
The Court need not make up a special definition
of debt for this particular statute.
Turning to the judicial -- to the sometimes
exception that there might be a judicial rule of
longstanding or pre-Code practice, which would require

this Court to look in a different direction than the plain

meaning.

Bankruptcy Code, there was never any distinguishment

4

between long-term lenders and short-term lenders.

5

For 80 years, prior to the enactment of the 1978

And there was never any reason, nor was there

6

any purpose in the statute to distinguish the protections

7

and --at the expense of long-term lenders.

8

were protected, regardless of the time limits of their

9

debt. When Congress eliminated the 45-day rule, what it

All creditors

10

really did was return bankruptcy law to a traditional

11

state of affairs that had existed for 80 years.

12

Also, most interestingly, many cases below, and

13

commoners have put tremendous emphasis on the fact that

14

only trade creditors and consumer lenders testified at the

15

hearings from 1980 to 1984. . And they say that because

16

other groups didn't testify, there is no reason to extend

17

the protections to those groups.

18

I submit to this Court that the trustee's

19

position that divining legislative intent by conducting a

20

head count of the witnesses that appeared before Congress

21

is really an absurd way of analyzing legislative history.

22

The fact that one group sat on the sidelines and chose not

23

to participate, either voluntarily or by subpoena to be

24

called and testify, doesn't prove anything.

25

this example, the long-term lenders may have been quite

In fact, in

1

content to sit on the sidelines, since the plain meaning

2

of the statute was going to plainly protect them.

3

If this Court were to part from the plain

4

meaning, it would also have to deal with another vice that

is not solved by the trustee's position.

6

inception of Congress' analysis in 1980 to change the

7

statute, the first group that triggered that review was

8

the commercial-paper issuers.

9

the statute, which had an artificial time limit of 45

From the

And they complained that

10

days, was excluding them from the protections of the

11

ordinary course rule.

12

And throughout the 4-year period, it was made

13

clear that those commercial paper issuers were to be

14

protected by the new statute -- in fact, so much so, that

15

Senators Dole and DeConcini, on the floor of the Senate,

16

made statements to that effect right before the

17

legislation was passed.

18

The problem is that if this Court were to part

19

from the plain meaning of the statute, you would be

20

required to write in another special exemption to the

21

statute for commercial paper issuers.

The 1984 Congress made it clear that its goal
was to promote and protect normalized business dealings.

MR. GRAHAM:

1

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

It did

2

follow a 4-year legislative review in which the 1978

3

Bankruptcy Code, which became effective in October of

4

1979 -- less than 1 year later complaints were laid at the

5

doorstep of Congres and the investigation and

6

congressional hearings ensued to determine what to do

7

about the statute.

8

It is petitioner's view that there is no reason

9

to exclude long-term lenders because the goal of the 1984

10

Congress was to promote and protect normalized business

11

dealings, and that -- they held that that could be

12

accomplished while discouraging unusual action in a race

13

to the courthouse.

14

I would point - -

Yeah.
That's correct.

But I don't know

But they -- so be it.

That's -- they

intended to do so.
MR. GRAHAM:

Right, and while some people

24

complain about that policy, I think it's interesting to

note that the very creditors who would be protected by

collectively bringing in preference payments and

2

distributing them equally, were the same group that went

3

to the 1984 Congress and said this is not a protection

4

that we seek.

5

-- normal business transactions immune from preference of

tax, so long as they're within the ordinary course of both

7

the debtor and the creditor's business.

MR. GRAHAM:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GRAHAM:

Well, I imagine that's -I mean, so to speak.
So to speak.

I think, though, that

13

the concern of Congress was that the statute, as written

14

with the artificial limitation, was requiring businessmen

15

to change their practices.

16

the Congress addressed.

And that was the problem that

We submit that since the key goal was to protect

17
18

and promote normalized business -- dealings, and to

19

prevent a race to the courthouse, it makes absolutely no

20

sense to carve out and exclude long-term lenders from that

21

process.

22

Long-term lenders usually hold the power to

23

bring a debtor's business to a halt.

In most cases, there

24

is one or two key long-term lenders.

And if the goal is

25

to prevent a race to the courthouse, why exclude that

1

lender from the protections of the statute?

2

point, you've taken away the very incentive that Congress

3

gave that long-term lender to deal with the debtor on a

4

day-to-day, regular basis.

5

keep his regular ordinary payments, why not call the loan

6

covenant?

7

At that

If he's not going to get to

Why not take more aggressive action?
I would also point out that although there is

8

much said about the idea of encouraging trade creditors to

9

deal with the debtor on a repetitive basis, and to supply

10

goods and services to that debtor, that is a policy which

11

is covered under subsection c(4) of 547.

12

subsection, Congress permitted a creditor who may have

13

received a preferential payment, that if he continues to

14

do business with the debtor, he will be able to offset any

15

future goods or services he delivers to the debtor against

16

that preference liability.

17

In that

So there is a specific statutory exception which

18

responds to the concern and the policy of promoting

19

creditors and trade suppliers to do business with the

20

debtor.

21

I also think that the Court need not attempt to

22

try to reconcile the 1984 Congress' different view of what

23

was the more important policy.

24

is that since the statute is not ambiguous, if the Court

25

attempts to reconcile the 1978 Congress' policy, which

1

there -- which favored more than quality of distribution

2

policy, it puts the Court in the improper role, I believe,

3

of trying to determine whether the 1984 Congress allegedly

4

forgot in passing this statute, and deleting the

5

artificial limitation to harken back to what, in 1978, was

6

considered to be a more important policy.

7

We submit that the case of West Virginia v.

8

Casey states that that is exactly what this Court should

9

not do, where the statute is clear, and therefore there's

10
11

no reason.
This is a case in which the Court cannot be

12

faulted for literalism in applying the statute.

The words

13

which created the distinction and previously allowed trade

14

creditors to benefit and sometimes other creditors not has

15

been deleted from the statute.

16

limit was removed, the statute applies to all creditors.

17

And we submit that the Court should reject the

Once that artificial time

18

trustee's attempt to add words back into the statute which

19

would change the statutory definition of the word debt.

20
21

22

Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are any
questions, I would reserve my time.
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Graham, if there -- should

credit arrangement.

Now, I understand this is a line of

1

MR. GRAHAM:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
Is there any distinction between the

3

fees and the monthly payments of interest, and the actual

4

pay-down of the principal?

5

MR. GRAHAM:

6

QUESTION:

In this -Do the fees and the interest payments

7

become -- are they due monthly, or are they long-term debt

8

also?

9
10

MR. GRAHAM:

Let me answer the question

factually, first, as to this case.
In this case, it was a revolving line of credit

11
12

-- although much larger, very -- similar to a person who

13

has a bank Master Charge.

14

just interest or also pay principal down, in any

15

particular month, was the borrower's choice by the express

16

terms of the document.

The choice of whether to pay

17

And so in this case, the payments which are at

18

issue happen to be interest payments, since the loan was

19

not what we would call a fully amortized loan.
When it came due, at the end of its term, the

20
21

principal would have to be paid in full, or the borrower

22

would have to renegotiate for a renewal or an extension of

23

the loan.

24
25

However, if I might add a point, the American
Bankers Association has filed an amicus brief and made the

1

point that the debt of interest, which is distinguished

2

from the debt of principal, probably was a short-term

3

debt, because it was incurred month to month and paid

4

month to month on a regular basis.

5

But we submit to the Court that the issue that

6

has been presented on the writ for certiorari is whether

7

long-term lenders, whether they receive ordinary payments

8

of interest or principal, whether they are excluded from

9

the protection of the statute simply because someone has

10

divined legislative intent based on who testified and some

11

very unpersuasive statements in the legislative history.

12

Mr. Chief Justice, I would reserve the balance

13

of my time.

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Wolas, we'll hear from you.

Very well, Mr. Graham.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20

MR. WOLAS:

If it please the Court, Mr. Chief

Justice:
We are here to determine whether or not, when

21

Congress amended the statute in 1974, it intended to

22

change, in totality, the preference rules.

23

QUESTION:

1984, you mean.

24

MR. WOLAS:

25

Between 1979 and 1984, every bankruptcy court in

1

the United States understood that when they were looking

2

at section 67 -- 547(c)(2), that statute incorporated what

3

was known as the current expense exception to the

4

Preference Recovery Act.

5

these short-term, in-and-out transactions whereby

6

suppliers of goods, utility companies, insurance premium

7

payments, were not within the preference provisions; that

8

these were part of the two-step discussion of contemporary

9

exchanges which do not diminish the estate.

That is, everybody knew that

Likewise, the

10

current exchange - - current expense theory provided assets

11

for distribution to creditors.

12

The question we have here, is is the Ron Pair

decision applicable to this case.

We should remember that 547(c)(2) is part of a

larger statutory scheme.

-- concept of 547(b), which is the preference rule.

20

the rule there says very clearly that if you received a

21

a debtor into bankruptcy, you had to allege an act of

And the most common act of bankruptcy was a

So you had to prove that the payment made to

The Court did not accept that.

in bankruptcy to prove insolvency is tough, because the

2

records are terrible.

3

So now we have a presumption.

At the same time, the Bankruptcy

4

Commission - - and it was also picked up in the proposed

5

judge's bill -- recommended the incorporation of what we

6

call the contemporaneous exchange exception, and the

7

current-expense exception.

8

Congress that the definition of antecedent debt, an old

9

bill, be modified to read:

This was done by suggesting to

(1) a bill that was paid

10

within 5 days is not an antecedent debt;

(2) personal

11

earning -- personal services were not an antecedent debt;

12

(3) if you pay the utility within ninety days, that was

13

not an antecedent debt; and (4) if you paid for inventory

14

which was purchased under ordinary trade terms and it was

15

paid for in 90 days, in the ordinary course of

16

business -- that was included in the suggested

17

language -- it was not a preference.

18

From 1973 to 1979, because the Congress did not

19

move too quickly, there were numerous hearings.

20

21

intention was to make the law move more smoothly.

That was a stipulated issue.

The Iowa Premium court, in my opinion, got

11

confused over the 45-day period and how you counted it and

12

when the debt arose.

13

almost all of the cases that deal with when was debt

MR. GRAHAM:

Well, I can refer to definitions of

what is not considered ordinary - - things that are

exceptional, unusual, not customary.

But the problem, of

And I thought that one of the other Justice's

out of the ordinary for a company of that size.

14

And later I will reintroduce myself to Mr.

Wolas, because I am one bank lawyer who would not require,

16

necessarily, great formality in loaning $7 million to

you to take the position, but maybe I shouldn't

MR. GRAHAM:

Yes.

And I believe that with

respect to Mr. Wolas' statement to this Court that there

11

is a judicially recognized exception of longstanding,

12

which he calls the current expense rule, I must

13

respectfully disagree.
There are a smattering of cases referenced in

16

struggled with certain types of debts, in unique

17

circumstances.

2

the concept of what was antecedent.
And in the new Bankruptcy Code, you have section

3

(c)(1), which says that the payment, the exchange between

4

the creditor and the debtor, does not have to be precisely

5

contemporaneous.

It has to be substantially

6

contemporaneous.

And if those cases were presented, there

7

would have to be a factual determination as to the debtor

8

and creditor - - whether it was substantially

9

contemporaneous within the conduct of their business.

10

But I would invite the Court to look at those

11

cases, and you will discover that they dealt with either

12

rent, or they dealt with creditors who had a given value

13

to the debtor, after receiving a preferential payment.

14

And the court did not want to assess that creditor with

15

the full preference he had received before.

16

For example, if he had received $10,000 on an

17

antecedent claim, but then had re-delivered $5,000 of

18

merchandise to the debtor, the court struggled with the

19

concept by saying, well, he was assisting the debtor in

20

the current operations, and therefore would not be subject

21

to preference liability for the full $10,000.

concept is embodied in section (c)(4) of 547, in which we
