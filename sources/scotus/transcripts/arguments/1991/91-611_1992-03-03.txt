ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN M. FOWLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FOWLER:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:
The question presented for decision in this case

11
12

is whether the Kansas Income Tax Act violates controlling

13

principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring

14

retired employees of the State and its political

15

subdivisions over retired members of the United States

16

Armed Forces.

17

Just three terms ago, in the case of Davis v.

18

Michigan Department of Treasury, this Court applied

19

settled principles of intergovernmental tax immunity to

20

strike down Michigan's differential income-tax deduction

21

scheme because it uniformly favored all retired State or

22

local government retirees.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The Court also construed a statute,

didn't it?
MR. FOWLER:

That is correct, Your Honor, it

construed a statute which this Court -QUESTION:

2

3

And just said that that incorporates

the intergovernmental rules.
MR. FOWLER:

4

Your Honor, I believe in the Davis

5

case the Court said that 4 U.S.C., section 111 is co­

6

extensive with, and thus fully preserves the modern

7

doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FOWLER:

So all you need is the statute?
Your Honor, perhaps the statute is

10

sufficient in and of itself because it plainly prohibits

11

discrimination against Federal officers or employees

12

because of the Federal source of their pay or

13

compensation.

14

Supreme Court has endorsed here under State standards of

15

review.

16

And that is precisely what the Kansas

For the reasons set forth in our briefs, which I

17

will attempt to elaborate on here, we respectfully submit

18

that the decision below should be reversed, because the

19

Kansas income tax structure plainly discriminates in favor

20

of all retired employees of the States and its political

21

subdivisions over retired members of the United States

22

Armed Forces in Kansas.

23

Petitioners represent a class of approximately

24

14,000 retired members of the Armed Forces in Kansas, and

25

their joint taxpayer spouses were applicable, who have

1

been subject to disparate income tax treatment by the

2

State of Kansas from at least tax year 1984 through tax

3

year 1989.

4

Several named petitioners brought suit in 1989

5

challenging that disparate tax treatment in the wake of

6

Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, on the basis

7

that the Kansas income tax structure, on its face and as

8

applied, violates governing principles of

9

intergovernmental tax immunity.

10

Notwithstanding the arguments raised below, the

11

Kansas Supreme Court held that differential tax treatment

12

of military retirement income by the State of Kansas was

13

constitutionally permissible, because it was directly

14

related to and justified by significant differences

15

between the classes of retirees.

16

However, in route to its decision, the Kansas

17

supreme court violated several cardinal principles of law

18

that this Court has recognized since at least 1960.

19

principles are as follows.

20

Government's interest must weigh in the balance whenever

21

intergovernmental tax immunity is at issue, the reviewing

22

court must examine the applicable tax structure as a

23

whole, and must focus on the nature of the classification

24

erected by statute to determine whether the proffered

25

reasons for discrimination furnish the actual basis for

Those

Because the Federal

1

differential treatment, and if so, whether those

2

differences furnish an adequate justification for

3

differential treatment.

4

The Kansas income tax structure utilizes Federal

5

adjusted gross income as the starting point for

6

determining an individual taxpayer's Kansas taxable

7

income.

8

incorporates and includes all forms of retirement

9

income -- from whatever source derived -- Kansas, one

Because Federal adjusted gross income

10

would think, should uniformly tax all forms of

11

nondisability government retirement income.

12

not.

13

But it does

Because of a specific, statutory exemption scheme

14

adopted by the Kansas legislature and in effect for more

15

than 30 years, Kansas exempts from State income taxation

16

all retirement benefits paid by the State and its

17

political subdivisions to their respective retirees.

18

QUESTION:

Well, did Kansas rely on some Federal

19

cases that hold that military retirement benefits are not

20

deferred compensation, but instead are reduced pay for

21

current services?

22

23

MR. FOWLER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

Kansas Supreme - -

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FOWLER:

Are those cases wrong?
Your Honor, those cases are not

1

wrong for what they stand for.

Those cases did not

2

involve taxation, they did not involve discrimination

3

against Federal military retirees, and they did not

4

involve 4 U.S.C. section 111 or the doctrine of

5

intergovernmental tax immunity.
For tax purposes, military retired pay is

6

7

substantially analogous to all other forms of pension or

8

annuity income.

9

expressly recognized by Congress.

And that is a point that has been

QUESTION:

10

Well, I guess the answer to the

11

question almost depends on the lens with which you're

12

viewing it.

13

question that you raise?

At what level of generality do we answer the

14

MR. FOWLER:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

There are differences.

Your Honor -When do we recognize them and when

don't we?
MR. FOWLER:

Your Honor, there are differences

18

between retired members of the military and other forms of

19

government retirees.

20

only if they are significant, and only if they are

21

directly related to the particular purpose and

22

classification at issue.

23

The differences should be recognized

In this case, Kansas does not draw distinctions

24

based upon the characterization of retired income --

25

retirement income as either deferred compensation or

1

2

current compensation.
The tax structure does not draw that

3

classification.

The purpose for the exemptions for State

4

and local government retirement income is unquestionably

5

to extend the value of that State and local retirement

6

income, while reducing and minimizing the State's

7

employment costs.

8

this Court recognized clearly in - - Davis as being

9

illegitimate.

10

Now - -

11

QUESTION:

12

13

And that, of course, is a purpose that

Now if you win here, the holding

presumably would be retroactive?
MR. FOWLER:

Your Honor, under the general rule

14

applicable in civil cases, I believe this Court has

15

recognized, we would assume that it would be retroactive

16

at least for the parties before the Court.

17

however, is not expressly presented by this case.

18

moreover, we would submit that there is --

19

QUESTION:

That issue,
But

Well, it's certainly lurking there.

20

What do you suppose we're talking about, looking at all 50

21

States here?

22

MR. FOWLER:

Your Honor, in our judgment, there

23

is no retroactivity question presented by this case for

24

the simple reason that reversal of the decision below

25

simply requires application of 4 U.S.C. section 111.

QUESTION:

1

Well, but didn't the Jim Beam opinion

2

indicate that if we don't say anything about it, then it

3

is generally retroactive?

4

MR. FOWLER:

QUESTION:

about it.

That's correct.
So you're saying don't say anything

And isn't that the consequence?
MR. FOWLER:

Well, Your Honor, that would suit

just fine with me.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. FOWLER:

But there is no retroactivity issue

11

in this case.

12

simply requires application of section 111 of title 4 of

13

the United States Code.

14

Because reversal of the judgment below

QUESTION:

Well, you don't think it's bad that

15

if these retirees' money has been taken from them

16

unconstitutionally it should be given back.

17

you're not apologizing for that, are you?

18

MR. FOWLER:

You're --

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

We

19

believe it should be given back.

20

recognized previously, the remedial issues involved in

21

this case, which have not yet been passed upon by the

22

Kansas Supreme Court, are typically left to the State

23

courts to pass on in the first instance.

24
25

But as this Court has

But back to my other point, there is no
retroactivity question in this case simply because it

1

requires application of a statute, which this Court, just

2

three terms ago, described as having unmistakable language

3

and meaning, which has been on the books for more than 50

4

years.

5

In order to hold that a decision in this case is

6

not retroactive, would in effect suspend the effective

7

date of a controlling Federal statute which has been the

8

supreme law of the land since 1939.

9

v. Fleming certainly supports the proposition that that is

10

And I think Fleming

something that would be inappropriate to do.

11

QUESTION:

May I ask --

12

MR. FOWLER:

Now if this were an ambiguous

13

statute, perhaps the conclusion might be different.

14

this is a plain and unambiguous statute.

15
16
17

QUESTION:
consent to tax.

But

Of course, it's a statute that gives

It's not a prohibition, isn't it?

But let me ask you a question about your basic

18

-- one of the differences in this case is that there is --

19

at least one or two categories of Federal retirees who are

20

not taxed by Kansas.

21

MR. FOWLER:

22

QUESTION:

Isn't that right?
That's correct, Your Honor.
Now, what if Kansas, in its

23

retirement system, had several categories of State

24

employees, and didn't tax --or did tax two or three of

25

those categories.

Would that eliminate the
10

1

discrimination?
MR. FOWLER:

2

It wouldn't eliminate the

3

discrimination, Your Honor.

4

the case in Phillips Chemical Company v. Dumas Independent

5

School District, where the State of Texas imposed a

6

discriminatory tax which generally provided benefits to

7

lessees of State and local property, but there were some

8

lessees of State and local properties that didn't get the

9

same benefits and were subject to the same tax treatment

10

In fact, that was precisely

as the United States lessees.

11

The Court simply stated in passing that that may

12

reduce the extent of the discrimination; it obviously does

13

not eliminate it.

14

QUESTION:

Well, supposing the State gave a tax

15

-- tax-free retirement benefits to only 10 percent of its

16

retirees, and Federal retirees, 90 percent were tax-free

17

under the State but there were 10 percent that were taxed.

18

Would that 10 percent also be entitled to the benefit?

19

MR. FOWLER:

Your Honor, I think that it would

20

depend upon the purpose behind the exemptions, and the

21

classification as it's drawn.

22

QUESTION:

Well, the purpose in the State

23

exemptions is to increase -- encourage people to work for

24

the State.

25

perfectly clear.

It's a form of extra compensation.

11

That's

MR. FOWLER:

1

Your Honor, the Court recognized in

2

Davis that simply relying upon that legitimate State

3

purpose is not a basis for discrimination.

4

says nothing about differences between the classes.

5

needs to be kept in mind that in dealing with

6

intergovernmental tax immunity, that sovereign Federal

7

interest must be weighed in the balance.

8

that that can be accomplished is if the discriminatory

9

classification is truly intended to account for

Because it
It

And the only way

10

significant differences between the classes, and it

11

furthers a legitimate State interest which does not trench

12

upon the prerogatives of the national Government.

13

Now, if that --

14

QUESTION:

What all that boils down to is that

15

if they give a tax-free retirement benefit to any State

16

employees, they must give them to all Federal employees.

17

That's your position, I gather.

18

MR. FOWLER:

We're not suggesting that, Your

19

Honor.

20

is being given -- especially to all State and local

21

retirees -- but if it is given to State and local

22

retirees, one must look to the purpose for it and how the

23

classification is drawn in order to properly evaluate it.

24
25

But certainly, if the -- if preferential treatment

And that's all we're asking the Court to do
here.

Because the Kansas Supreme Court failed to examine

1

the applicable tax structure, as a whole, and it failed to

2

focus on the nature of the statutory classification.
QUESTION:

3

Because if you examine it as a whole,

4

the Federal employees are basically treated like everybody

5

else in Kansas.

6

group of people who get a special benefit.

They're just not treated like this small

MR. FOWLER:

7

Well, Your Honor, this small group

8

of people that get a special benefit, as this Court

9

recognized in Davis, because they are in privity with the

10

State, the danger that a State is violating the doctrine

11

of intergovernmental tax immunity is greatest in this

12

case.

13

Once a decision has been made to discriminate by

14

giving exemptions to a favored class of State and local

15

government employees, there is no political check in the

16

system to turn back the clock.

17

And the reason for that is simple.

18

provide the check, to provide equal treatment which is

19

mandated under the nondiscrimination clause of section

20

111, that would either require an exemption for similarly

21

situated Federal retirees, which would reduce tax revenue;

22

or, if the tax were applied uniformly, as this Court

23

recognized in Davis, in order to provide State and local

24

retirees with the same level of benefits, benefits would

25

have to be increased in fact beyond the level of that

In order to

Which means once the decision to discriminate

2

3

has been made, there is no political check because there

4

are political, economic, and institutional forces against

5

changing the status quo.

6

are going to be losing revenue.

7

tax increase across the board.

And it may result in a

And the vast majority of voters in the State

8

9

Because any way they turn, they

will not stand for that, which is why we are here in

10

Court.

Because military retirees in Kansas have been

11

fighting for equal treatment in the legislature for over

12

20 years.

13

this Court to provide them with equal treatment, because

14

they are substantially analogous to every State and local

15

government retiree for all material purposes.

They haven't gotten it.

And we are now asking

16

Military retirees must serve for at least 20

17

years in the Armed Forces before they are eligible for

18

retirement.

19

are eligible for retirement; when members of the military

20

retire, they lose their entitlement to active duty pay and

21

allowances and instead receive retired pay.

For these reasons, it isn't surprising that

4

under the Internal Revenue Code Congress has determined

5

that these military retired folks are entitled to the same

6

tax treatment as all other Government retirees.

7

given equal treatment by Congress, and as we noted in our

8

brief, Congress has expressly determined that there are no

substantial grounds for distinguishing the tax treatment

They're

of the plan for the uniformed services from these other

11

plans.

12

The States are not given the power or the

13

authority to override or veto that authoritative

14

determination.

There is no justification for disparate treatment.

There are no significant differences.

If there are no - -

20

Federal retirees, as a class, don't get?

21

They get to go to the PX when they're

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

22

those types of benefits, which are also available to

23

members of the military on active duty, are expressly

exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code.

1

approach, those allowances or special entitlements don't

2

qualify as income to a retired person.

3

But it would seem to me, Your Honor, that if

4

Congress has decided to provide retired members of the

5

military who have provided honorable service to the United

6

States for 20 years or more with access to medical

7

services, so that they might remain fit in retirement,

8

with access to PX or commissary privileges, it's not a

9

proper domestic concern of the State that the Federal

10

Government has elected to provide these additional

11

services to them.
QUESTION:

12

No, but it does tend to distinguish

13

the military retirees from the Federal Government as a

14

whole retirees that were involved in the Davis case.

MR. FOWLER:

Your Honor, there may be

distinguishing features.

they must be relevant for tax purposes.

19

is suggesting that that's another reason that they can tax

20

them, it must be relevant to some legitimate aspect of tax

policy.

We're not denying that.

But

I must say it's hard to say what's

it would be constitutional to impose a tax on uniforms.

MR. FOWLER:

3

Your Honor, perhaps I misspoke.

4

Part of the State's argument in this case is not that they

5

can tax retired members of the military because they --

6

well, they're saying precisely that they can impose an

7

income tax on retired members of the military in part

8

because they can wear a uniform in retirement.

9

not suggesting that they can tax the uniforms -- and

They're

10

perhaps they could tax the uniforms.

11

fact that they can wear uniforms doesn't seem to us to be

12

a legitimate justification for taxing the income received

13

by those members of our retirement -- retired community.

14

QUESTION:

But certainly the

Do you really want to rest on the

constitutionally permissible under the second prong of the

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

14

MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

15

I'd like to begin by addressing Justice

16

O'Connor's question about the level of generality at which

17

this issue must be addressed.

18

The statute prohibits taxation that

19

discriminates against an officer or employee because of

20

the source of the compensation.

21

In Davis, this Court defined that test as

22

prohibiting discriminatory taxation between Federal and

23

State retirees unless there were significant differences

24

between the two classes of taxpayers.

25

QUESTION:

It really doesn't prohibit it.

It

1

just doesn't extend the consent.

2

MR. MANNING:

It does --by negative

3

implication, I believe -- in -- this Court, in Davis held

4

that by negative implication it also prohibits it and that

5

it's coextensive with the constitutional doctrine of

6

intergovernmental tax immunity.

7

But to return to the question of what a

8

significant difference would be, for purposes of Davis, we

9

believe that significance has to be assessed in terms of a

10
11

legitimate tax purpose.
Now, there are many differences between Federal

12

and State employees.

To give one example, Federal patent

13

officers are different from any State or local government

14

employees, because unlike State and local government

15

employees, they're authorized to issue patents.

16

significant difference between a Federal employee and a

17

State and local government employee.

difference that has any significance for tax purposes.

That is a

20

a statute that taxed Federal patent officers more heavily

21

than State and local government employees.

disadvantaged, would that be a legitimate tax distinction

2

in your view?
MR. MANNING:

3

We believe that a neutrally drawn

4

classification that attempted to account for double

5

taxation by reference to the manner of funding would be a

6

legitimate classification and would survive scrutiny under

7

section 111.

8

going on in this case.

9

However, that is not that -- the -- what is

In this case, it is true that no part of the

10

military retired pay is taxed before it is received

11

because it is not funded by employee -- in any part, by

12

previous employee contributions.

13

State and local government retirement benefits are funded

14

in part through employee contributions that were

15

previously taxed.

16

It is also true that

But Kansas also exempts that portion of State

17

and local government retirement benefits that consist of

18

employer contributions and accumulated interest which,

19

like military retired pay, have never previously been

20

taxed.

21

Now, we submit that a nondiscriminatory tax

22

truly intended to avoid double taxation would not fully

23

exempt State and local government retirement benefits

24

based on their source, but would generally exempt

25

retirement benefits to the extent they reflect previously

So there is

I would also like to address Justice O'Connor's
point about the other Federal cases.

The legal conclusion

10

that retired pay is current compensation in cases

11

involving such matters as bankruptcy or laches does not

12

necessarily govern the question in the context of section

13

111 and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.

14

As Mr. Fowler pointed out, Congress, in fact, treats

15

military retired pay not as current pay in the Internal

16

Revenue Code, but as deferred compensation in such

17

statutes as the --as FICA, and in the individual

18

retirement account statute.

19

So there is certainly a recognition in the

20

Federal code that military retired pay can have aspects of

21

deferred compensation.

sufficient to overcome the requirements of the quality

that are imposed by section 111, which states that the

State cannot discriminate against Federal employees - - as

extended to retirees in Davis, or as applied to retirees

in Davis -- because of the source of their compensation.

As long as the classification is drawn in a

In Kansas, military retired pay is taxable, and

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

State retirement benefits are not taxable.

And it's our

10

position that this differential tax treatment is valid

11

because it satisfies the test set out in Davis v.

12

Michigan.

13

And that test requires that differential tax

14

treatment must be directly related to and justified by

15

significant differences between the two classes of

16

taxpayers.

17

And our position is, very simply, that these two

18

classes are taxed differently because they are different.

19

And the primary justification for different tax treatment

20

is the fact that military retirees receive current pay for

21

current services; and State retirees receive pension

benefits -- they receive deferred compensation for prior

services.

I believe it's correct that it is

MR. BARTLE:

You may be right.
I would like to focus, for a

16

the Court conducted an inquiry to determine if this

different tax treatment was justified.

18

demonstrates first it is not just the mere fact of

19

discrimination, not the fact that Federal retirees receive

20

less favorable treatment than retired State employees.

21

That is not conclusive.

1

since there were no differences between the two classes

2

themselves, no intrinsic differences, the taxation must be

based on some other factor, some outside factor.

4

And, of course, in Davis, the Federal Civil

Service retirees receive their pay from the Federal

Government, and the State retirees were paid by the State.

So that was determined to be a tax that distinguished

And as to those other

with regard to military.

MR. BARTLE:

Precisely.

And that is because

10

military retirees are unique.

11

State retirees, and they are different than all other

12

classes of Federal retirees.

13

QUESTION:

They are different than

Well, the problem is, we have to look

at all of the classes of Federal employees, I suppose,

that Kansas says we can tax, and try to figure out if

there's some legitimate State policy being implemented.

extended across the board to all the classes that Kansas

purports to tax.

It certainly would make the Court's

MR. BARTLE:

I can see Your Honor's point.

I'd like to point out that in Kansas, we have

were legitimate differences between the two classes.

9

Maybe this is a significant

Maybe State judges are treated differently.

As to these other classes of Federal retirees,

10

I'm saying that perhaps there are justifications which

would permit us to tax them in the manner that we do.

Then I think you -- you know, I'd feel quite

differently about this statute.

3

It just says a tax shall be imposed on military retirees.

4

And then you come in and say well, this is why they are

5

different.

But it doesn't say that.

But do we know that that's why the State made
the distinction?
MR. BARTLE:

Your Honor, out statutes do not

state that a tax shall be imposed on military retirees.
10

Military retired pay is included in Federal adjusted gross

11

income, which is the basis that the tax is imposed at the

12

State level.

So it's -- it is not singled out in any

MR. BARTLE:

QUESTION:

MR. BARTLE:

It is not given the same exemption

That is correct, yes.
That's singled out, I think.
It's not singled out in the same

manner that there is a specific provision that says we are

setting aside this discrete group of taxpayers.

subjecting them to unusual tax burdens that do not apply,

22

as a general proposition, to other taxpayers of the State.

We are

earlier to say that if Kansas had statutory provision that

feel that would pass muster.

Well, I don't think he conceded that.

I think he conceded they would then look to the - - I think

there was still a whiff of the pretextual about it.

So I don't think he was precluding a further
substantive examination.
MR. BARTLE:

Well, I took his comments to mean

10

that if the statute set out, in specific terms, a neutral

11

classification, a neutral basis for different tax

12

treatment, that that would be permissible.

13

For example, there are other States that have

14

such provisions.

15

from contributory retirement programs shall be exempt, and

16

noncontributory retirement programs shall be taxable.

17

And, of course, that is what we have here in Kansas.

18

simply that our statute is not framed in that manner.

19

They say benefits reserved -- received

And I think the Court ought to look to the

practical effect of this tax, rather than the form in

which the statutory language appears.

It's

I'd like to turn to the policy reasons that

underlie the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.

MR. BARTLE:

I think the statute prohibits a tax

that is Congress' way of prohibiting a tax that is trying
