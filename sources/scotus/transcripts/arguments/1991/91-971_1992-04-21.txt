ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIMBALL J. CORSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CORSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices of

the Court, good morning.
This is an intellectual property case.

It is a

11

restaurant trade dress case under section 43(a) of the

12

Lanham Act.

13

In broad terms, the issue before you this

14

morning is not whether the Two Pesos restaurant chain

15

copied the appearance of the Taco Cabana restaurant chain.

16

It is, instead, a different issue.

17

Cabana has a publicly recognized and understood appearance

18

that may not be copied.

19

protectability under 43(a) of the Lanham Act.

It is whether Taco

It is a question of

20

If Taco Cabana does not have a protectable trade

21

dress, the issue of copying is not involved, and there can

22

be no actionable confusion under section 43(a) of the

23

Lanham Act.

24

an original, recognized source of origin.

25

43(a) does.

And the reason for this is that it protects

Mr. Corson, I think this case arose

Act.

MR. CORSON:

QUESTION:

9

MR. CORSON:
QUESTION:

10

That is correct.
Now, it's been revised.
Yes.
Do you think that under the revision

11

of this statute that secondary meaning always must be

12

shown?
MR. CORSON:

13

Yes.

And the reason for that is

14

that the revisions of the act were largely in regard to

15

the disparagement issue, and do not affect the language

16

that is key and relevant to this case.

17

We still have, in the revised act, the language

18

that says, any person who, or in connection with any goods

19

or services --skipping some material -- uses in commerce

20

any false designation of origin -- and that gets back to

21

the issue.

22

origin, which is what was pled in this case, the

23

infringement of which was the basis of the judgment, then

24

we are still dealing with the issue of secondary meaning.

MR. CORSON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
So that the brief for the Private

4

Label Association states the question accurately -- it

states it differently than you do - - but it states

6

accurately the question that's before the Court?

MR. CORSON:

QUESTION:

I believe it does, but with
It's more general than we posit it.
So we have to assume that this would

10

be a protected trade dress if secondary meaning is not

11

required?
MR. CORSON: . That is correct, sir.

12

The issue of

13

secondary meaning has historically been required for trade

14

dresses.

15

was in the Chevron, Fifth Circuit case that that rule was

changed.

That has been the rule for many, many years.

And it was changed, interestingly enough, for a

QUESTION:

Why was it changed?

It may

What was the

basis for changing it?
MR. CORSON:

The basis for changing it was not

22

well articulated, sir; it was simply the judgment that on

23

viewing it, it was arbitrary or fanciful.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CORSON:

Was there some agency involved?
No, sir.

QUESTION:

MR. CORSON:

3

The Fifth Circuit -- the

judgment --

Well, who changed it?

QUESTION:

Well, so it was changed within the

Fifth Circuit then, is what you're saying.
MR. CORSON:

6

Yes, de novo, on de

7

novo -- basically under a de novo standard it was viewed.

8

It was determined to be inherently distinctive, and that

9

was largely the end of the discussion.
The difficulty that crops up in making those

10
11

judgments is that it is very difficult to look at a trade

12

dress and be able to tell whether it is inherently

13

distinctive.

the Fifth Circuit?

This is a problem the United States

QUESTION:

It wasn't based on any change in the

statute?
MR. CORSON:

No, sir.

It was based on a

22

sentiment that it would be nice to bring trade dress law

23

into conformity with trade law -- trademark law.

QUESTION:

And it recognized that it was

MR. CORSON:. It did not discuss that, sir.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CORSON:

4

QUESTION:

Was it?
Yes.
But we didn't take the case on the

5

question of whether the restaurant is inherently

6

distinctive in its trade dress, did we?

7
8

MR. CORSON:

No, I believe it's on the question

really of whether secondary meaning is required.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. CORSON:

11

QUESTION:

Exactly,•yes.
And I think the notion -So we should just assume the

12

inherently distinctive trade dress, for purposes of

13

answering the secondary meaning issue?

14
15

MR. CORSON:

that has caused confusion in the case, Justice O'Connor.

16
17

That is a difficult proposition

QUESTION:

Yeah, but I thought you said that you

lose if we decide secondary meaning is not necessary.

18

MR. CORSON:

19

problem of semantics.
QUESTION:

20

That is correct.

But there's a

Well, if it wasn't inherently

21

distinctive, you never even get to secondary meaning, do

22

you?

23

MR. CORSON:

If it is not inherently

24

distinctive, of necessity you have to address the question

25

of inherent distinctiveness.

The argument would also be -- and mine is a

1

2

little different here -- it is that even if it is

3

inherently distinctive, all we are really saying when we

4

use those words -- and it's a bad bit of

5

nomenclature -- is that we will, from its appearance only,

6

presume that it is distinctive.

7

have in this case is that that presumption was

resoundingly defeated by the actual evidence.

evidence came in and said, in the Texas market there is no

MR. CORSON:
QUESTION:

Because

Yes, sir.
And it seems to me -- maybe I'm

11

wrong -- but the rationale of your temporal protection is

12

to punish or prohibit copying.

13

MR. CORSON:

Sir, I believe the argument is a

14

narrow one.

there is not a determination that Taco Cabana's restaurant

MR. CORSON:

1

The rationale for it is exactly the

2

fact that if somebody comes into a market, they are fresh

3

and new to the market, they develop a trade dress which is

4

highly unusual, that for a limited period of time they

5

should be afforded some protection.

MR. CORSON:

No, right after that there would be

a requirement that secondary meaning be proved.

It means that we, from the

appearance of this particular mark, trade dress, what you

will, infer that it is arbitrary or fanciful, as those

terms are used in trademark law, so that we will say it is

MR. CORSON:

If it were registered -- assume it

There is no -- they did not allege a

common law cause of action under a Texas common law?

18

MR. CORSON:

I believe they did, but it folded

in under the 43(a) section.

43(a) because the common law brings nothing additional to

it.

MR. TARANTO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1983, Taco Cabana created and adopted an

18

inherently distinctive trade dress so that consumers would

19

come to recognize it and associate it with Taco Cabana.

20

In 1985, before Taco Cabana had opened anywhere

21

outside San Antonio, Two Pesos came along and deliberately

22

took the trade dress and used it to identify its competing

23

restaurants to its consumers.

MR. TARANTO:

2

That's right, the intent of Two

3

Pesos is not essential to a violation of 43(a).

4

intent may well be, and traditionally has been an

important element in deciding on the available relief.

6

And it is in that respect that the question whether we

could get an injunction would, I think, turn on whether

Two Pesos just happened upon a look-alike trade dress, or

clear that inherent distinctiveness or secondary

origin of the goods as a branded identifier.

Now the reason

V

1

that's enough, and you don't need widespread recognition

2

throughout whatever market you're talking about -- be it

3

State-wide or elsewhere -- simply follows from the reasons

4

that protection is offered in the first place.

5

Protection of a trade dress or a trademark of

6

any brand identifier serves two important functions:

7

protects consumers' ability to distinguish goods so that

8

they can select the ones they like and the ones they don't

9

like; and because it protects consumers' ability to

10

distinguish goods, it protects businesses' ability to

11

identify themselves to the public and to maintain,

12

control, and build their own reputations based on their

13

own quality without consumers being confused.

14

By protecting brand identifiers, you therefore

15

serve the goal of competition on the merits among

16

clearly distinguished brands.

17

like --a competitor like Two Pesos comes along and

18

copies, or uses a confusingly similar dress is that you

19

replace competition in the merits by competition by

20

deception.

You send a false message of affiliation to

21

consumers.

And the harms that the Lanham Act - - that any

prevent -- start from the beginning.

QUESTION:

1946 -- and it's kind of a common law

I mean, it kind of picked up the common law, and

9

affects how we address statutes.

Do you think that the law in 1946 had developed to the

point where you would have prevailed, or do you rely

largely on common law - - what I might call common law

15

developments of this statute subsequently?

16

MR. TARANTO:

There's some

I think -- let me try to answer

that this way.

18

sufficiently vague and amorphous that we would have had an

19

argument that on these facts, the common law should say

20

that inherent distinctiveness was enough.

21

because the common law recognized two somewhat distinct

22

causes of action --a so-called technical trademark cause

23

of action, and the broader, kind of residual, unfair

competition cause of action.

The common law categories in 1946 were

I think the answer to that is yes.

But the place in the analysis that that would come in

It might well be different.

MR. CORSON*

I think I'd go that far, also.

You've got nothing to protect.

There's a

fundamental disagreement here.

He's arguing that all you

need to get to is to show that there is some possibility

5

here that the trade dress has become confusingly close.

6

That's not the issue.

7

that you have a protectable trade dress, and you can't do

that if it isn't recognized, because the language of the

Yes.
