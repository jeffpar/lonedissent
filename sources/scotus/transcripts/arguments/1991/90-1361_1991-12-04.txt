ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Do

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1789, Benjamin Franklin said that there is

15

nothing certain in life except death and taxes.

16

years, Congress has endeavored to ensure that the tax part

17

of this saying holds true.

18

enacted a comprehensive set of interlocking provisions

19

designed to ensure that even insolvent taxpayers and their

20

fiduciaries pay taxes owed to the United States.

21

For 200

Since the 1790's, Congress

This case involves application of these ancient

22

statutes to a liquidating trustee appointed by a

23

bankruptcy court who in the course of liquidating and

24

investing the debtors' assets realized more than

25

$80 million of taxable gains and interest income.

Since

1

the debtors had been stripped of their assets by the

2

bankruptcy court, they obviously could not pay the taxes

3

due on this income.

4

Congress anticipated this simple fact pattern as

5

long ago as 1916 by requiring in what is now section

6

6012(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that receivers,

7

assignees, and trustees in bankruptcy with fiduciary

8

control of the debtor's assets are to report and pay the

9

taxes.

The court of appeals concluded in this case,

10

however, that the liquidating trustee is a mere contract

11

trustee and therefore escapes the duty to report and pay

12

taxes.

13

Inverting the statutory scheme, the court said

14

that the Government should look to the penniless debtors ,

15

rather than to the trustee for taxes on the income - -

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, would you explain to me

17

whether the Government thinks two income tax returns

18

should be filed for this period, one by the trustee and

19

one by the debtor?
MR. JONES:

20

The trustee should file returns for

21

the individual debtor's estate and for the corporate

22

estate.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And should the individual debtor also

file an income tax return for the same period?
MR. JONES:

I assume so, but that would be

bankruptcy separate from his estate, that income would be

4

taxable to him personally but the estate --

5
6

QUESTION:

And would he have to show any of this

transaction on his personal income tax?

7

MR. JONES:

No.

With respect to an individual,

8

when he goes into bankruptcy his assets form a separate

9

taxable entity, his estate in the bankruptcy court.

That

10

separate taxable entity for the individual files a return.

11

The trustee does that.

MR. JONES:

We have a corporation named Holywell

Yes.
All of which should file one return,

and the trustee under 6012(b) is to file that return.
In addition, we have an individual named Gould,

19

and his individual estate, the return for that should be

20

filed by the trustee, also.

21

QUESTION:

Are there other areas in the tax law

22

where there -- well, let me preface the question.

23

the individual and the corporation, do they also have the

24

obligation to file a return?

1

Revenue Code, a corporation is treated differently from an

2

individual when it goes into bankruptcy.

3

continues to be a taxable entity even when it's in

4

bankruptcy, so the trustee under 6012(b) has to file a

return for the corporation.

managing the debtor's properties.

When the

individual goes into bankruptcy, whatever he brought to

10

the bankruptcy is a separate taxable entity that is -- and

11

the return on that is made by the trustee.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, the Government is relying

13

only on section 6012, but the other petitioners rely on

14

two other sections as well.

15

two other sections?

16

MR. JONES:

What's your position on those

Well, as I will attempt to explain

17

in more detail later on, 3713 of title 31 is called the

18

absolute priority statute, and we agree with the debtors

19

that it is a safety net, if you will, that if the trustee

20

is not subject to reporting and paying taxes under

21

6012(b), he would be required to pay taxes under the

22

absolute priority statute.

23

With respect to 28 USC 960, which is the other

24

statute that the debtors refer to, there are two points of

25

view about that statute.

Historically, it was enacted
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

simply to make clear that a trustee or receiver was not
exempt from State taxation, and the statute only referred
to State taxation.

When Congress recodified title 28 in

1948, for some reason that the legislative history does
not explain, they added the word Federal to the statute,
and so now it says that the officer of the court shall be
responsible for State, local, and Federal taxes.
Since there is no legislative history, we are in
the dark on what Congress meant to accomplish.

The I.J.

Knight decision of the court of appeals, I believe the
Ninth Circuit, concluded that all that the word Federal
did was to make it clear that there was no negative
implication that somehow a trustee should be protected
from Federal taxation.

That's one view.

The other view

is the debtors', which is that by putting the word Federal
in, Congress made many of these other statutes
unnecessary.
We don't --we haven't taken a position on that
statute in this case.

We certainly don't think that the

Court need reach it because this case is quite comfortably
resolved by section 6012(b) of the Internal Revenue Code,
which is where we would anticipate Congress would place
tax requirements.
QUESTION:

The Court -You say comfortably, except you

really are requiring that the language trustee in a case

under title 11 be applied to a situation in which the case

2

under title 11 is completed.

3

MR. JONES:

Well, we don't agree, and nor is

4

there any authority that this case is completed.

5

the trustee has acknowledged that the case hasn't been

6

closed.

7

assets of the estate still remain within the estate, as

8

the bankruptcy court held in the In re T.S.P. case.

In fact,

A case can't be closed in bankruptcy when the

12

been liquidated before a plan was provided to distribute

13

them.

14

but we don't think Congress meant this statute to be a

15

shell game that allows an inventive creditor to come up

16

with a plan where the assets are liquidated within the

17

estate but after a plan is confirmed and thereby get out

18

from under the statute.

It could have been done in what

bankruptcy, which everyone agrees was simply modernized in

2

1980 to say trustee in a case under title 11, that the

3

term trustee in bankruptcy explicitly included a

designated as in control of

QUESTION:

"any other person

the assets of a debtor in any

Well, Mr. Jones, I guess you don't

8

have to rely on whether this is a trustee in a case under

9

title 11 if he's an assignee.

10

MR. JONES:

Well, that's correct.

We also think

11

that he comfortably falls within that definition also.

12

Again, there is a 60-year-old Treasury regulation that

13

defines an assignee as simply anyone who acquires

14

possession and control of a debtor's estate for the

15

purpose of paying the debts.

16

definitions, either of those regulations, the trustee

17

quite clearly is caught, and Congress quite clearly

18

intended this income to be caught for taxation.

19

Under either of those

In the National Mufflers case this Court held

20

that an agency -- that the Treasury's regulations should

21

be upheld if they reasonably implement the statute.

22

no one disputes that these trustees, the income they

23

receive is intended to be taxed by Congress and that these

24

regulations reasonably implement the statute.

Well,

1

statute doesn't reach the trustee, the debtors have no

2

assets, the income would simply escape taxation.

3

not a result that anyone in this case has suggested

4

Congress intended.

5

That's

The trustee's argument that this is -- that in

6

1980 when Congress amended the statute to insert the

7

modern language, trustee in a case under title 11, that

8

they converted this into a technical term, a term of art.

9

That technical argument has no basis in the regulations or

10

in the legislative history of the act, which refers simply

11

to the fact that the statute is intended to require any

12

fiduciary who has the debtor's assets to pay taxes.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question?

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

17

estate by proposing a plan that didn't provide for these

taxes.

19

Well, it's pretty evident the trustee wasn't

20

defrauded, but it is also clear that the estate was not

properly implemented.

6

Fidelity, that's a very difficult argument for the trustee

7

to make.

8

that terms such as executor, receiver,

statutes requiring fiduciaries and insolvents to pay

12

The Court reached the same conclusion in the

Spring Valley Water case and in United

States v. Key, in

14

which the Court specifically said that

such provisions

15

plan of reorganization.

When this occurs, the estate continues, the

4

trustees admitted that the estate -- the case hasn't

5

closed, the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction to

6

supervise the trustee, to approve claims, and the trustee

7

in every sense continues to act as a trustee in the case.

8

9

As we've already discussed, if the statute had a
gap it would be filled by the words, assignee, which

10

applies, according to the regulations, to anyone who comes

11

into custody or control of the assets for the purpose of

12

paying the debtor's debts.

13

The collateral consequence that occurs if the

14

trustee is deemed to be an assignee is somewhat

15

significant, and I touched on it briefly.

16

States would have an absolute priority for the payment of

17

taxes under the absolute priority statute, instead of a

18

bankruptcy priority under 501(b)(1) of the code and under

19

the plan, and the trustee would also be personally liable

20

for taxes under 3713(b).

The United

21

We differ with the debtors on this only in that

22

we think it's clear under cases like In re San Juan Hotel

23

from the First Circuit in 1981 that a trustee has a

24

fiduciary duty under title 11 to pay taxes and can be

25

personally liable if he fails to do so.

To this point, all I've talked about is the

1

corporate estate.

3

the individual is under (b)(4) rather than (b)(3), which

4

requires any fiduciary of an individual estate to file a

5

return.

6

The trustee's duty to file a return for

The court of appeals said that this trustee is

7

not a fiduciary because his duties are too ministerial.

8

In King v. United States the court rejected a similar

9

claim that a disbursing agent had only ministerial

10

functions and was not liable as a fiduciary for ensuring

11

payment of taxes on a bankrupt estate.

12

court emphasized that what is critical is the element of

13

control that the fiduciary has over the assets and not the

14

scope of his discretion.

15

In that case, the

As Judge Cox noted in his dissent in this case,

16

the trustee's duties here were far from ministerial.

He

17

was appointed to receive and manage the assets, to

18

identify and determine claims against the estate, to

19

liquidate and invest the assets, and ultimately to make

20

distributions.

21

that a fiduciary performs in a bankruptcy, and prior to

22

this case every court of appeals that had considered the

23

issue had uniformly concluded that a liquidating trustee

24

in an individual bankruptcy is a fiduciary subject to

25

section 12(b)(4).

Those are precisely the type of duties

There are three other issues that I'd like to

touch upon briefly that respondents have asserted.

have asserted that perhaps this is a grantor trust and

that as a grantor trust the fiduciary should not be liable

reason to do that.
The only time it ever arises is when you've got
an insolvent debtor and you've got these unique
circumstances where there is some doubt that the
Government will be able to get its tax money.

That's when

the priorities take effect.
I do agree with the Government that there is an
attempt to create a pattern of preference to the
Government.

Outside of bankruptcy, before bankruptcy ever

occurs, 3713 flat out says that if you've got the
following conditions, if a debtor owes the Government
money and the debtor is insolvent and he makes a voluntary
assignment of his property -- the Government's argument,
by the way, is that this was involuntary -- but if he
makes a voluntary assignment of his property, then the
Government gets paid first, and if they don't, the person
who makes that transfer is personally liable.
The statute has to have the last part of it
read.

It says, in sub (2), this subsection does not apply

to a case under title 11, and the logic is obvious.

As

long as you're not in bankruptcy you can establish a
priority of payment rights to the Government for their
taxes.

Once you go into bankruptcy you've got to try and

read the bankruptcy code together with the Internal
Revenue Code.

You've got to try and make sense out of

MR. STETTIN:

10

happened, if we can make it applicable to you we're going

11

to ask you to unravel this substantially consummated plan.

12

Now, I am very sensitive to the argument that if

13

they're entitled to the money under any circumstances they

14

ought to be entitled to get it regardless of when they ask

for it, because there is no statute of limitations --

there would be a penny's worth of gain from this real

Nothing in the disclosure statement indicated

Unless the United States has to assume that

every piece of real estate that is sold is going to create

a large taxable gain and that the trustee is not going to

properly implement the plan that requires him to pay his

obligations and to hold them as Class 1, why would the

United States have done anything?

11

There would have been

no reason to.
It was the trustee that should have done

something if he felt there was a taxable gain, and the

only thing he did when he decided there was a taxable gain

was to get an indemnity instead of paying the taxes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, would you tell me what you

respond to the argument made by your colleague to the

effect that you can't take the dictionary definition of

assignee in 6012(b)(3) because if you do any purchaser of

19

the assets will be an assignee?

20

MR. JONES:

Well, we would rely on the

21

regulatory definition, which we do think focuses on what

22

the statute is intended to guard against, and that is that

an assignee who obtains possession of the assets of the

debtor for the purpose of paying the debtor's debts, we

QUESTION:

So you also don't argue for the

dictionary definition.

4

MR. JONES:

Well, I think that -- only for the

5

part of it that involves an assignment, and there was an

6

assignment here to the trustee.

7

assets of the estate were assigned directly to the trustee

8

and he was empowered to manage them in any manner that any

owner would be empowered to.

reach the trustee because that involves corporations, and

17

the court never even considered the fact that (b)(4)
