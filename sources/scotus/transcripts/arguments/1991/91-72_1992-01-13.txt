ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
This Court has stated repeatedly that the

10

11

starting point for statutory interpretation is the

12

statutory text that Congress enacted.

13

relevance here, even though the question before the Court

14

involves the scope of a judicially implied exception that

15

is not itself to be found in the statutory text.

16

That admonition has

The comprehensiveness and unqualified nature of

17

the prohibitions of restraints of trade and of unfair

18

methods of competition that are in the text nonetheless

19

have much to say about the proper resolution of this case.

20

In the Parker against Brown line of decisions, this Court

21

has held that those Federal statutory prohibitions of

22

commercial conduct should not be interpreted to apply to

23

the activities of the States themselves and derivatively

24

to private conduct that implements the States' regulatory

25

policies.

1

Now, the basic error of the court of appeals in

2

this case as we see it is that in its concern to give

3

generous scope to this implied exemption, in its concern

4

to give the exemption ample elbow room, it gave the

5

exemption a penumbrile expanse that cuts into the quick of

6

the statutory restraints on private conduct that Congress

7

did enact, the statutory commands that embody what this

8

Court has described as our national policy in favor of

9

competition, and most emphatically in favor of price

10
11

competition among horizontal competitors.
Contrary to the court of appeals approach, this

12

Court's decisions have made clear that primacy is to be

13

given to the statutory command and that the scope of the

14

implied exemption is limited by the exemption's purposes

15

and is to be delimited so as to preserve the effectiveness

16

of Congress's prohibition of privately imposed trade

17

restraints.

18

see reflected in the rigorous two-prong test for exemption

19

of private conduct that this Court unanimously adopted in

20

the Midcal Aluminum case and that the Court has elaborated

21

in subsequent decisions.

22

This is the jurisprudential perspective we

The first prong of that test, that there must be

23

a clearly articulated State policy, is not at issue in

24

this case as it reaches this Court, but the reasons why

25

that prong alone does not suffice to exempt private

1

conduct are illuminating in considering the function that

2

the second prong must play, because if merely a clearly

3

articulated State policy that private conduct would be

4

exempt from the antitrust laws would suffice, the States

5

would in effect be given the power to repeal the Sherman

6

Act and the other antitrust laws industry by industry as

7

they choose.
And in Parker against Brown itself the Court

8

9

recognized that that cannot be the case under our

10

constitutional system and under the supremacy clause, and

11

said that a State does not give immunity to those who

12

violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate or

13

by declaring that their action is lawful, something that

14

the Court quoted again just a year or so ago in the Omni

15

case.

16

So the second prong is of crucial importance

17

here, and the second prong as it was formulated and as

18

it's been repeated every time, says that the conduct must

19

be actively supervised by the State itself, and every time

20

the Court has formulated this prong it has used the

21

modifier actively.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, under your standard as

23

proposed, I wonder how a regulated entity or business

24

would ever know whether the action was going to be

25

protected by Parker immunity?

It seems to me that it is

1

an area where we're better off with a clearer line so that

2

these businesses know one way or another whether there's

3

going to be Parker immunity.

4

MR. WALLACE:

5

QUESTION:

Of course --

And to leave it open, as you suggest,

6

to evaluating in each case the extent to which the State

7

is - - the quality of its activity seems to me problematic.

8

9

MR. WALLACE:

If I may say so, Justice O'Connor,

that's several questions rolled into one, and to start at

10

the end, the standard we are proposing and the standard

11

you just described are two different standards.

12

what you just described is the way others have portrayed

13

our approach to this question.

14

much simpler one.

15

approval by State officials of the proposed rates, and we

16

mean approval of the substance of the restraints.

17

QUESTION:

I think

To us the inquiry is a

It is whether there has been review and

Well, do you mean the States could

18

never employ the so-called negative option approach that

19

was used here whereby you file the rate, it goes into

20

effect unless the State disapproves it?

21

to me that then you're suggesting that isn't a possible --

22

MR. WALLACE:

It would appear

Professors Areeda and Turner in

23

their analysis came to the conclusion that the negative

24

option approach really cannot suffice as an adequate

25

method of State supervision.

1

We don't go that far.

We think that there can

2

be a showing that the option was exercised in a way that

3

showed that the State officials did in fact approve the

4

policies and -- except that they were reviewed, and that

5

the State can manifest its approval in any way it sees

6

fit, including a failure to disapprove, as long as there

7

is assurance that the State has reviewed and approved the

8

restraint, the particular restraint as consistent with the

9

State's regulatory policies.

10

11
12

13
14

It's harder to manifest that in a negative
option system of regulation, but it can be manifested.
QUESTION:

Aren't you getting into the substance

of the State regulation if you go that far?
MR. WALLACE:

We don't believe so.

We think

15

that the only inquiry is whether the State made that

16

determination, whether State officials determined not that

17

the filing was approved for filing, that it had all the

18

requisites, as we explain in footnote 16 of our brief,

19

that are required for a filing to be put into the file,

20

perhaps made available for public scrutiny, but that the

21

officials have determined that the rate itself that has

22

been agreed upon, the uniform rate that was submitted, is

23

consistent with the State's regulatory policy.

24
25

QUESTION:

We --

Excuse me, how does the individual

who has to know whether he can apply that rate that he's

1

agreed with, with other people pursuant to this State

2

scheme, how does he know it -- I mean if the State agency-

3

just has a regular procedure whereby the clerk of the

4

State agency after 30 days issues an order saying the

5

rates are hereby approved and the individual doesn't

6

really know whether they looked at them or didn't look at

7

them?

MR. WALLACE:

8

9

What's he supposed to do?
Then he has to find out before he

engages in conduct that would be a per se violation of the

10

Sherman Act and similarly a violation of section 5 of the

11

Federal Trade Commission Act.

12

QUESTION:

13

But how does he find out?

Tell me

how he would do that.

14

MR. WALLACE:

He has to find out by asking the

15

officials so that he's got an answer from the State that

16

will stand up under scrutiny in proceedings of this kind

17

so that he can make his defense that yes, I engaged in

18

price fixing with my competitors, but the prices were

19

approved by the State.
QUESTION:

20

What if the order is not signed by

21

the clerk but is in fact signed by the agency heads, a

22

majority of them or all of them, but in fact they don't

23

look at it, they just sign it routinely.

24

after 30 days and they sign it and they haven't looked at

25

it all.

Does that protect them?

QUESTION:

4

MR. WALLACE:

What's the answer?

I'm not going to say the fact that

the agency officials signed an order is a conclusive

showing that they reviewed and approved the rates.

commission or whoever it is in Phoenix or whatever city,

more about -- I take it what you're suggesting is that

2

they interrogate the people responsible for the decision

3

as to how the decision in that particular case was

reached?

5
6

MR. WALLACE:
about it.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

Well, that is one way of going

What would be another way?
Well, obviously with a public

utility commission that issues a decision or that holds a

10

hearing, you've got a written record.

11

negative option systems that it gets more difficult to the

12

point, as I said, where Professors Areeda and Turner

13

thought they just won't suffice, and I do think it's more

14

of a burden for the regulated competitors to be able to

15

make the requisite showing when that is the kind of system

16

that the State is utilizing, but our concern has to be

17

that unless they can establish that defense to price

18

fixing, Congress has without qualification comprehensively

19

prohibited price fixing among competitors.

20

QUESTION:

It's in these

In a close case it seems to me that

21

the inquiry will be after the fact of the conduct.

22

is to say, the title company has no assurance in a close

23

case what resources the State can or will devote to

24

reviewing the price fixing until after it's submitted, and

25

yet the title company has to know at the time that it

That

1

makes the submission or has its meetings that the conduct

2

is protected.

3

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it has to know, for business

4

planning purposes it certainly is better for it to know

5

that none of these State schemes compel the companies to

6

charge uniform rates, even if a submission has been made.

7

They are still free to deviate from those under these

8

schemes.

9

These are not tariff schemes of the kind that

10

you've got where there has -- you know, at the ICC or

11

something of that sort, so the prudent course of action is

12

for them to continue to engage in price competition unless

13

and until they can assure themselves that they have had

14

review and approval, or that the scheme has a system of

15

review and approval that they are entitled to rely upon as

16

having been applied in their case, a system of actual

17

review and approval.

18

I'm not -- the commission has said that an

19

aberrational failure to apply the scheme accurately and

20

properly in a particular case is not going to defeat the

21

exemption, but they look to see whether the rates have

22

been submitted into a scheme where there is in fact review

23

and approval of the rates themselves as consistent with

24

the State regulatory policy.

25

It is hard to see what else suffices under the

very standards that this Court has articulated about what

constitutes satisfaction of the active supervision prong

of the Midcal test.

The Court has said that there must be

May I interrupt with a question, Mr.

I know it's not an issue, or I know the case

10

only involves the second prong of this two-prong test, but

11

what is the State policy that justifies the State program?

12

Is it one to protect the companies from bankruptcy, or is

13

it one to prevent them from charging too much?

14

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the various statutes

15

articulate mostly policies to assure that there will not

16

be discriminatory practices and that there will not be

17

unreasonable rate practices, and the submissions --

QUESTION:

In other words, it's more like the

MR. WALLACE:

supporting data, although in practice sometimes those data

were not submitted.

QUESTION:

Does the State policy require all the

companies to join in the joint program?

1

2

that is in the record of this case.
QUESTION:

The reason I asked you about the

3

first prong, it seems to me that in order to judge whether

4

there's been adequate supervision of carrying out the

5

State policy, you kind of ought to know what the State

6

policy is, and I'm a little puzzled from the briefs as to

7

just what the States are trying to do here, other than

8

maybe just approve of a joint ratemaking that the

9

companies wanted to get.

10

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we shy away from what we're

11

accused of by filings on the other side from an evaluation

12

of the quality of the State policy, so the Court's cases

13

have made it quite clear in Hoover against Ronwin and

14

others that the States can choose their own policy and it

15

isn't up to Federal courts in deciding whether to confer

16

an antitrust exemption to evaluate whether the policy is a

17

wise one, whether the policy adequately protects consumers

18

in comparison with the antitrust laws and so forth.

19

So we see the second prong inquiry as a rather

20

simpler one, and that is just to determine the fact that

21

State officials have looked at the rate and substantively

22

determine whether the rate itself complies with whatever

23

the State's policy is.

24

what the commission found lacking here.

25

QUESTION:

That's what suffices, and that is

Let me ask one other question.

Is

there any distinction between the rates for

charges for the title searches, of the charges?

agreements - -

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

Are they

The --

--or proceedings, I should say.
There are package rates involved

in the submissions to the State officials.

The commission

10

challenged only the search and examination components,

11

which are the larger share of it, because of the

12

McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption for the business of

13

insurance.

14

separately by other persons than insurance companies in

15

many instances, and the commission's theory was that that

16

is not part of the business of insurance within the

17

exemption.

18

Search and examination are conducted

Now, in one of the States at issue it was found

19

that there was no review and that State -- and this

20

is -- I'm speaking of Connecticut -- and that State

21

authorities had no authority to review a very important

22

element of the insurer's expenses, namely commissions to

23

the broker or sales agent, and those commissions could

24

affect all of the charges, you see, including those for

25

search and examination services, so the charges can get

1

intermixed and intertwined in a way that affects the

2

portion of the price-fixing that the commission and we

3

contend is not within the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption.

4

Now, we do not believe that this Court has left

5

the governing principles obscure, and we've quoted in our

6

brief relevant portions from this Court's opinions,

7

including its recent opinion in Patrick against Burget.

8

Respondents and their amici differ in how they would

9

modify the principles this Court has so carefully

10

formulated, and which we don't believe require

11

improvement, and we certainly don't believe would be

12

improved by their modifications.

13

Respondents themselves defend the standard

14

adopted by the court of appeals that there must be some

15

basic level of activity.

16

how that standard can be reconciled with a sentence in

17

this Court's opinion in Patrick against Burget saying on

18

page 101 of volume 486, the mere presence of some State

19

involvement or monitoring does not suffice, and then with

20

a supporting citation to 324 Liquor --

21

QUESTION:

It's rather hard to see exactly

But in Patrick against Burget the

22

State authority had no authority to review at all the

23

actions of the private authority, did it not?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

That is true in that case, but not

in 324 Liquor, for which the Court relied in the citation

1

immediately following that sentence.

2

inquiry if - - it certainly would be an elaborate process

3

to try to reconcile what it is that constitutes some basic

4

level of activity that does not constitute reviewing the

5

rate itself and deciding whether the rate is consistent

6

with the State's regulatory policies.

7

generate uncertainty it would be a standard that looks not

8

to the rate but looks to activities that are really off

9

point for the purposes of the exemption.

10

QUESTION:

In any event, the

If anything would

Well, Mr. Wallace, you say reviewing

11

the rate itself, which is what you say should be done, and

12

I believe, that a certificate or an order signed by a

majority of the commissioners saying we have reviewed the

rate and find it conforms to the State policy would not be

16

conclusive.

17

MR. WALLACE:

Well, you have added a little bit

18

to the way he formulated the hypothetical I believe,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, and it would be stronger evidence if

20

they said we have reviewed the substance of the rate.

21

QUESTION:

Would it be conclusive?

22

MR. WALLACE:

I hesitate to say that any one

23

piece of evidence would always be conclusive regardless of

24

what other evidence there is in a particular case.

think that as you formulated it, it would be extremely

QUESTION:

It's an

At any rate, you're dealing with

8

something that usually is a question of fact in every

9

case.

10

MR. WALLACE:

11

QUESTION:

Exactly so.

There's no presumption of regularity

12

given to administrative proceedings, so that ordinarily

13

turns those things into more questions of law than

14

questions of fact.

15

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the presumption of

16

regularity applies when there is a duty to do something

17

and then it's a rebuttable presumption in a particular

18

case.

We've discussed that in a footnote in our brief.

19

It gets closer, it seems to me, when we speak of

20

the presumption of regularity, to the structural test that

21

some of the amici suggest as a replacement for the court

22

of appeals test and for the formulations this Court has

23

used, a test that would just say whether State authorities

24

had -- the State officials had the authority whether they

25

used it or not, contrary to what this Court has said, that

1

they must have and exercise the authority.

This would

2

require not a simple question of fact of whether the

3

matter was reviewed, but a really quite contentious

4

inquiry into what are the duties of the State officials

5

under the particular scheme.
As you can see from the filings in this case,

6

7

there's much disagreement about what were the legal duties

8

of the officials in the four States at issue here, and one

9

way to introduce evidence about how should their duties be

10

interpreted is to look at what they in fact have been

11

doing as the officials' own interpretation of the duties,

12

and it seems to me that this leads to a much more

13

contentious kind of judgment on whether the officials are

14

properly carrying out their duties under State law than

15

the simple inquiry that we think this Court's cases look

16

to, the simple factual question of did they review and

17

approve the rates as consistent with their policy or

18

didn't they, regardless of whether they should have under

19

State law.

20

QUESTION:

Assume the statute itself told the

21

agency that one of your duties is to review these rate

22

filings to see if you should object to them, and that they

23

have the staff to do it, they've got the money to do it

24

and the State expects the agency to carry out its duties.

25

Do you think that you need some more proof?

I do, because all of those are

questions that are subject to debate in a particular case,

whether that's a discretionary duty or a mandatory duty,

whether the funding and the staff are adequate to perform

the duty or inadequate and they really can't perform the

duty.

wouldn't make any difference to you how clearly the duty

was spelled out, how well it was funded, and how much

policies.

1

Appeals below should be affirmed by this Court because the

2

standard of active supervision which it utilized strikes a

3

carefully constructed balance, we submit, between the

4

goals of the Federal antitrust laws on the one hand and

5

the principles of federalism which underlie State action.

6

The circuit court standard provides assurance

7

that the States have enacted a legitimate regulatory

8

program while leaving to the States themselves the task of

9

assuring its strictness or its effectiveness.

10

Each of the States here had enacted a system of

11

regulation with agencies staffed and funded and charged

12

with a duty to assure that the States' rate policies were

13

adhered to, and over the period of time encompassed by

14

this proceeding these regulators had given administrative

15

attention to these bureaus and their filings.

19

8

Stevens, about the underlying State policies that these

statutes were designed in effect to enforce, all of the

statutes in question required that the rates be not

MR. CHRISTIE:

No, Your Honor.

could file them by designating a license rating bureau --

Let me also -- let ask you, as long

as I've got you interrupted, what do you think the court

7

below meant by the words that the activity is in place,

8

staffed and funded, and shows some basic level of

9

activity?

10

MR. CHRISTIE:

I think the Third Circuit

11

intended by those words to suggest that it's appropriate

12

for an antitrust court simply to confirm the seriousness

13

of the State's intent to assure that its policies were

14

being adhered to by looking to see whether in fact the

15

regulatory activity existed.

was there some indication that they were in fact acting,

that they were -- as we put it in our brief, that the cop

QUESTION:

7

MR. CHRISTIE:

Justice O'Connor, you're right.

8

We think that they misperceive the record in this case.

9

Obviously, it's the record itself that demonstrates

10

whether or not these States were regulating and not the

11

arguments of counsel.

12

indicates, as we've laid out at some length in our brief,

13

that the regulators in these States looked at the filings,

14

that they asked questions about the filings, that they

15

asked - - that they demanded that these rating bureaus

16

provide increasingly sophisticated and expensive

justifications for their rates, and ultimately the

regulators approved the rates and allowed them to become

QUESTION:

3

MR. CHRISTIE:

I don't think, at least, Justice

4

Kennedy, insofar as the record is established here, that

there's an indication that the regulators participated in

the sense of sitting down with the bureau itself as it

determined what rates it wished to file.
What your question does address, an issue that

8

9

is appropriate, I think, for the Court to consider, there

10

obviously -- in the course of a regulator's review of a

11

rate there is a need to look at it when it is first filed.

12

There is also the desirability of keeping some sense of

13

what the continuing impact of the rate is over the years

14

the rate is in effect.

15

We think in this case these departments did

16

both.

They reviewed the rate when it was filed, and they

17

made effort to -- by demanding that the bureaus produce

profitability studies showing the impact of the rate over

19

the years that ensued, they made an effort to keep track

20

of the impact of the rate in that respect as well.

1

at considerable length in an appendix all of the States

2

classified by various ways in which they in effect allow

3

rates to become in effect, and their catalogue of what

4

States do suggests that the most frequently used procedure

5

which the States have designed is the so-called demur or

6

negative option procedure.

7

This is a procedure, in other words, not just

8

the brain-child of the legislatures in these four States

9

with respect to title insurance, but it is used widely

10

throughout many lines of insurance in many States and I

11

think insofar as regulation of other economic enterprises

12

is concerned as well.

QUESTION:

What is the advantage, though?

saves the clerk from signing something saying the

15

commission has considered this rate and it's okay?

16

MR. CHRISTIE:

It

Justice Scalia, I think from the

that it doesn't force the insurance regulator to look at

QUESTION:

Well, suppose the State agency has a

general rule - - I don't see how it would apply to this

of regulation -- that any rate that will affect all of the

6

consumers in a total amount of less than $30 million

7

simply won't be reviewed, which might make sense given the

8

staff that the particular agency has available.

they have that rule, we just won't look at them if the

They don't want the regulator to

be forced to spend the resources she has looking at each

and every rate.

13

QUESTION:

So the situation you have left, then,

14

is that under the Federal antitrust laws within that

State, people can collude to fix rates so long as they

know the take on it isn't more than $1 million within that

picks.

that perform some level of activity consistent with their

to rely on the market to take care of these fringe minimum

there was some competition among and between title

conclusion from the fact that two companies went broke

that there shouldn't be competition.

12

MR. CHRISTIE:

Well, they obviously were

concerned about insurer insolvency and they felt it was in

14

the State's interests in their wisdom to begin to regulate

15

the rates for title insurance companies and in that

16

instance to permit rating bureaus to operate.

17

We submit that the type of qualitative analysis

which permeates the Federal Trade Commission's decision

below is an inappropriate standard for active supervision.

20

Both the Third Circuit and the First Circuit in the New

22

Commission for insisting on sitting in judgment of the

23

strictness or effectiveness of what these States did which

fit.

2

We think that their decision is consistent with

3

this Court's precedent, which has evidenced a

4

determination to give the States some breathing room to

5

regulate.

6

the Sherman Act was not designed to compromise a State's

7

ability to regulate, and rejected a compulsion requirement

8

for Midcal's prong one test.

In Southern Motor Carriers the Court held that

In Town of Hallie, the Court also rejected an

intense inquiry into legislative intent as undermining the

policies of federalism.

opinion, the Omni case, decided by this Court last term,

13

the Court rejected an inquiry into whether the municipal

14

regulation of billboards was in some way procedurally or

15

substantively defective or deficient.

16

rejected a conspiracy exception to State action,

suggesting that the probing into the intent of a regulator

was anathema to the federalism principles that underlie

State action.

Several of the members of the Court,

questioning Mr. Wallace, have expressed concern about the

22

problems which private parties would face if the Federal

the law, and indeed we submit that would be a practical

problem which would cause the withdrawal of companies from

2

these companies to withdraw from the rating bureaus in

3

this case.

4

Mr. Wallace suggests that to meet the

5

commission's affirmative determination test, all a company

6

would have to do would be to in effect communicate with an

7

insurance department or in some other fashion endeavor to

8

evaluate ahead of the fact what they might do.

9

that however cautiously and carefully a company

I submit

10

considering entering into a rating bureau and joining in a

11

collective filing might be, there just is no way to assure

12

that ultimately, whatever commentary is received in

13

advance, the department will act in a way which might

14

satisfy the Federal Trade Commission.

15

Any test, we submit, that leaves for later

judicial assessment the quality of what a regulator has

done defies predictability.

QUESTION:

Mr. Christie, something just crossed

my mind.

20

argument, which is very strong, but is the --if your test

21

is correct and the Third Circuit's test is correct, isn't

22

the McCarran-Ferguson statute pretty much redundant now?

23

Maybe it doesn't really go to the force of your

MR. CHRISTIE:

Well, Justice Stevens, at least

24

measured by the commission's perception of the application

25

of the McCarran Act here, you might call it redundant.

Obviously, however, they are two different -- they involve

2

two different issues.

3

QUESTION:

They are analyzed differently.
What I mean is - - and I'm not saying

4

you're not absolutely correct, but if this is all that's

5

necessary, I'm sure every insurance department throughout

6

the country engages in at least this basic level of

7

activity, so you don't really need a statutory exemption

8

because it will be all taken care of under Parker against

9

Brown.

10

MR. CHRISTIE:

Well, certainly -- certainly as

11

Your Honor recites it, that kind of definition of Parker

12

Brown may in many cases make it unnecessary, if you will,

13

for an insurance company to separately establish a

14

McCarran-Ferguson exemption, but I don't think that should

15

in any way affect this Court's analysis of either.

QUESTION:

It just suggests that maybe the

Southeastern Underwriters case was wrongly decided.
QUESTION:

on the basis
QUESTION:

2

3

Was it your position before the

commission that McCarran-Ferguson protected you?

4

MR. CHRISTIE:

Absolutely, Justice White,

5

because these search and examination services which title

6

insurers conduct, they conduct as a necessary part of the

7

process of underwriting that they go through, are

8

necessary because it's through this process that they come

9

to conclude what they're willing to insure under the

10

policy and what they're not willing to insure under the

11

policy.
QUESTION:

12

The only reason McCarran-Ferguson

13

doesn't cover the whole thing is that some of the

14

activities arguably are not the business of insurance.

15

MR. CHRISTIE:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

My hypothetical earlier was assuming,

17

talking only about the business of insurance, and I think

18

under your analysis, and it may well be right, we really

19

don't need the McCarran-Ferguson amendment any more.

Well, of course there are some

MR. CHRISTIE:

Well, I think the regulation by

18

has been pretty well established to be a test that

requires a court to simply look at whether by legislation

a State has permitted or prohibited the activity in

The analysis, of course, that the Third Circuit

policy.

3

They look to see that the regulators have ample

4

duty and power under those statutes, and finally they look

5

to make sure, as we put it, that the cop is on the beat,

6

that these regulators are staffed and funded, and that

7

there's confirmation that in fact regulation exists.

8

QUESTION:

And you think that that's less

intrusive upon State sovereignty than simply looking to

10

see whether in fact the rate was considered?

11

how many people considered it, how good they were, was the

12

rate considered?

13

MR. CHRISTIE:

Don't care

I think it is less intrusive

14

because it looks to the existence as opposed to any effort

15

to assess the quality of the regulation.

16

concede, as many of our amici have very forcefully argued,

17

that any test that goes beyond looking to the statutory

18

structure of regulation runs some risk of lapsing into

19

some sort of qualitative analysis of what is going on.

also concede that it lessens the possibility of certainty

21

or predictability for private parties considering whether

MR. WALLACE:

1

36 States have filed a brief

2

saying that their regulatory options are in fact being

3

constricted by this decision because relatively modest

4

programs would have drastic consequences on consumers.
On pages 6 to 8 we have summarized the evidence

5
6

found by the commission in these States in which rates

7

were allowed to go into effect for years without

8

supporting data being submitted even when requested, and

9

the title insurance company certainly knew they weren't

10

submitting the requested supporting data.
Of course, it's easier for them if they can rely

11
12

on the mere existence of a program, but it is harder on

13

the States than on the consumers and on the policies of

14

the Sherman Act.
QUESTION:

15

Any one of these States could change

16

its policy without any leave from this Court and beef up

17

its regulatory process, couldn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

18

That is correct, but the States

19

are arguing that principles of federalism would support

20

their having the option to do more modest programs without

21

having the drastic consequences found here.
