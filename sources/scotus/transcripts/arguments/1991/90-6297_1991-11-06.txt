ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH H. HANSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. HANSON:

Mr. Chief Justj.ce, and may it

please the Court:
This Court granted a writ of certiorari to the

13

Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to review in a sentencing

14

guideline case the sentencing of Joseph N. Williams.

15

Williams was indicated, tried, and convicted and sentenced

16

in 1989 in the District Court for the Western District of

17

Wisconsin for violating 18 U.S.C. section 922(g)(1),

18

possession of a firearm having been previously convicted

19

of a felony.

20

Mr.

The issue before this Court is whether or not in

21

a sentencing guideline case a sentence must be remanded

22

for resentencing if both improper and proper factors were

23

relied upon by the district court in sentencing, or

2.4

whether such a sentence may be upheld if there are proper

25

factors standing alone that would justify the imposition

of the sentence.
Williams was sentenced in the district court

2

3

both on improper and proper factors, the 27 months in

4

prison to be followed by a 3-year period of supervised

5

released.

6

district court in this sentencing were arrests that had

7

not resulted in convictions.

8

there was nothing determining that these factors were

The improper factor that was considered by the

There was no litigation,

indicative of more serious criminal activity.

The United

10

States Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence with these

11

improper factors, notwithstanding it stated in its opinion

12

a specific holding that there was error on the part of the

13

district court in considering such sentencing an arrest.

14

Notwithstanding that they affirmed the sentence.

15

It should be noted that arrest records in and of

16

themselves which have not resulted in convictions are

17

prohibited by section 4A1.3 of the guidelines, Sentencing

18

Guidelines.

1

that these arrests not resulting in convictions, whether

20

or not litigated, should not have been considered in the

21

defendant's criminal history points if they were not based

22

upon accurate and reliable evidence of a more significant

23

criminal history.

The Seventh Circuit stated in its opinion

24

The district court in its preliminary

25

calculations, this is the preliminary, sir, calculation of

1

the correct applicable sentencing guideline considered the

2

recommendations of the probation office which placed the

3

offense level at 9, criminal history points at 10, and a

4

criminal history category of Roman numeral V, with a

5

resulting sentencing range of 18 to 24 months.

6

The district, however, in its final

7

determination of the applicable sentencing guidelines,

8

that's his final determination, what he actually

9

considered it to be, the correct applicable sentencing

10

guideline, decided that the criminal history category was

11

not adequately considered by the probation office and he

12

assessed 3 additional criminal history points, raising the

13

criminal history points to 13 and the criminal history

14

category to 6, with an offense level of 9 and a sentencing

15

range of 21 to 27 months, which was greater.

16

He had previously stated that he was going to

17

assess the sentencing against this defendant based at the

18

highest level, so this raised him up from 24 to 27 months

19

by the inclusion of these 3 additional points.

20

doing, in determining the final applicable guideline, the

21

district court misapplied the guidelines by improperly

22

considering, incorrectly applied the sentencing guidelines

23

by improperly considering in sentencing the numerous

24

arrests which had not resulted in convictions and which

25

defendant had never been prosecuted.

But in so

1

Here's what the district court said when he did

2

this, this was raising up his 3 points from 10 to 13.

The

3

serious criminal conduct reflected in those arrests, the

4

serious criminal conduct reflected in those arrests,

5

coupled with convictions more than 15 years old, both of

6

which are barred by the sentencing guideline, suggested to

7

the court that the defendant's criminal history was

8

significantly more serious than that of most defendants in

9

category V, and the court added 3 criminal history points

10

to the previous criminal history point calculation of 10,

11

resulting in 13 criminal history points, and placed the

12

defendant in category VI with a sentencing range of 24 to

13

27 months, and by so doing he misapplied the guidelines.

w

14
/

4A1.3 does not permit prior arrest records in

15

and of themselves to be considered in sentencing, and the

16

sentencing guidelines in 4A1.1 section A also state that

17

convictions over 15 years old are not to be considered in

18

sentencing.

19

QUESTION:

Do you think there is any indication

20

in this record that the trial judge would have given a

21

lower sentence if he had not considered the arrest record?

22

MR. HANSON:

Well, in his preliminary

23

calculation he said I am setting the criminal history

24

points at 10.

25

arrests and other criminal activity which were not

Then he says however, because of these

1

resulting, they are over 15 years old, the other point

2

that he made in doing this, the convictions were over 15

3

years old, he says because of those they show a more

4

serious criminal history because - -

5

QUESTION:

And the trial judge --

6

MR. HANSON:

7

QUESTION:

Pardon me.
The trial judge also said that the

8

court, too, is well aware of the fact that a prior arrest

9

record itself shall not be considered.

10

MR. HANSON:

11

the 4A1.3, I can consider that.

12

saying there is permission in certain areas of the

13

sentencing guidelines to consider that type of thing.

14

the sentencing guidelines in permitting that specifically

15

states this does not apply to arrest records in and of

16

themselves.

17

there had been no convictions on those arrests.

18

Okay.

But then he goes and he says
He steps over that by

But

That's what he's relying on here because

QUESTION:

Well, when the Seventh Circuit

19

reviewed this it determined, I guess, that it thought the

20

sentence was reasonable.

21

was reasonable even though there was a misapplication of

22

the guidelines with regard to the prior arrest record.

23

MR. HANSON:

Right?

That the sentence given

No, I don't think so.

Because if

24

there is a misapplication of the guidelines the

25

reasonableness issue is not a part of it.

All you have to

1

show in a misapplication that there was a misapplication,

2

then the congressional will stated in that section of the

3

code, 18 U.S.C. 3742(1), if there is a misapplication you

4

shall remand.

5

Clear and precise, shall remand.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought, I thought the

6

Seventh Circuit did not remand, that it found it was

7

reasonable - -

8

MR. HANSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. HANSON:

Isn't that

That's correct.

They did.

That's

correct.

13
14

-- and it didn't remand.

right?

11
12

They did.

QUESTION:

All right.

So I'm trying to find out

what the theory of that court was.

15

MR. HANSON:

Well, the theory of it is they say,

16

and I'll again answer that they have a rule, the Seventh

17

Circuit clearly stated its rule in this regard and in its

18

opinion.

19

opinion, it was error for the district court to consider

20

the prior- arrests of defendant, it was error to do that,

21

that had not resulted in convictions.

22

vacation of the sentence is not necessarily required.

23

It stated it was error, this is out of their

Nevertheless

This is what they say, this circuit, the Seventh

24

Circuit has adopted the rule that the sentence may be

25

upheld if there are proper factors that standing alone

1

would justify the departure.

2

other factors that they could say in their mind was

3

sufficient to justify this sentence regardless of the

4

improper factors being there, they would affirm the

5

sentence.

That's their position.
QUESTION:

6

In other words if there are

Well, would the Seventh Circuit

7

affirm if it were satisfied that the district court would

8

have imposed a lower sentence absent those factors, or

9

just if it -MR. HANSON:

10
11

I don't think they really

considered that.
QUESTION:

12

-- or if it's satisfied that the

13

district court would have imposed the same sentence

14

anyway?

15

MR. HANSON:

I think what they're really saying,

16

and I'm not trying to avoid your question, is that they

17

would affirm it regardless of what the improper factor was

18

or whether it determined in a higher sentence or a lower

19

sentence if there were proper factors in their opinion

20

that would justify this type of sentence.

21

disregarding the improper factors, but they cannot do

22

that.

23

opinion which is based in three or four other circuits say

24

that there is no way to control as to which amount the

25

improper factors had in the final decision.

They are

If there are improper factors considered, the other

They don't

1

know.
QUESTION:

2

Is there any need for remand if it is

3

clear from the record that the same sentence would have

4

been imposed?

5

MR. HANSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HANSON:

8

9

Yes, there is need for it.
Why?
Because you don't really know that.

And the - QUESTION:

Well, my assumption was if it's clear

10

from the record that the same sentence would have been

11

imposed, what's the need for a remand?

12

MR. HANSON:

Well, I don't think it is that

13

clear because you are saying then it is possible for a

14

reviewing court to determine accurately, consistently

15

right, what is the correct sentence here, and they have

16

determined that below.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, we always do that with harmless

error analysis, don't we?

19

MR. HANSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HANSON:

Well -Or appellate courts do.
There is this doctrine of harmless

22

error, but I don't think in the guideline situation that

23

you can do that.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what if you had a situation in

which the court said I am considering all of these arrests

but in fact my sentence would be exactly the same even if

2

I didn't consider the arrests?

3

of throwing in, that's just what I'm doing, but

4

I'm -- that is not dispositive and in fact I would have

5

come to the same conclusion without it.

perfect harmless error situation there, wouldn't you?

In other words I am kind

MR. HANSON:

case on that point --

9

QUESTION:

I would refer you to a very good

Well, before you refer me to the

10

case, though, do you think that harmless error analysis

11

would be appropriate in that instance?

12

MR. HANSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HANSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HANSON:

No, I do not, sir.
Why not?
I'll tell you why.
Okay.
In United States v. Stephenson, 887

17

F.2d 57, at pages 61 to 62, it's a Fifth Circuit case

18

1989, a guidelines case, the court of appeals in that case

19

found a similar incorrect application of the sentencing

20

guidelines.

21

of convictions more than 15 years old, not arrests not

22

resulting in convictions, but both of these factors were

23

considered improper by the sentencing guidelines.

24

they go on, the Fifth Circuit, the Government invites us

25

to consider the erroneous weighing of the prior

The improper factor there was the considering

You would have a

And

1

incarceration as harmless error as the district court

2

indicated he would probably have imposed a sentence of 151

3

months even if he could have adjudged less.

4

Okay, here we go.

We may not do so, however, in

5

the light of 18 U.S.C. 3742 (f) (1) which directs, if the

6

court of appeals determined that the sentencing, that the

7

sentence was imposed of a violation of law or imposed as a

8

result of the incorrect application of the guidelines, the

9

court shall remand for further sentencing proceedings with

10

such instructions as the court considers appropriate.

11

QUESTION:

But isn't -- you go ahead.

12

QUESTION:

I was just going to say why didn't

13

you just cite us to the statute instead of to the opinion?

14

I mean, it is what the statute says, that if it was

15

imposed in violation of law or imposed as a result of an

16

incorrect application of the guidelines, it must remand

It's yours on appeals, isn't it?

22

MR. HANSON:

23

They've done that in this case.

24

because of that consideration of the improper factors.

25

QUESTION:

They've done that in this case.
He raised up three points

Well, there were three factors that

the court mentioned, but you can't show that without the

one incorrect one it wouldn't have been the same sentence.

3

You don't, we just don't know.

4

you to show that the sentence was a result of that, it,

5

you just haven't made out your case.

6

(f)(1) and you're down to (f)(2), because you'd say it's

7

outside the, without that factor maybe it's outside the

8

applicable guideline range and is unreasonable.

9

gather that's what the court did here, so it just decided

And if the burden is on

So you get out of

10

whether it was unreasonable or not.

11

it was a result of the improper factor?

here?

MR. HANSON:

QUESTION:

And I

But how do you know
Do we know that

Well, I think we do.
Why?

It mentioned that factor and a

15

number of others.

16

that factor, and if the burden is on you to show it was as

17

a result of an incorrect application then --

It might have been the same without

MR. HANSON:

QUESTION:

There is -But the factors, the factors the

20

court of appeals relied on were not among the factors that

21

the district court referred to.

QUESTION:

You've got two questions, Mr. Hanson.

Why don't you answer Justice Scalia's first and then

24

answer Justice Blackmun's.

1

MR. HANSON:

I'm going to point out to you,

2

there is a statement in the district court's opinion, this

3

is why I think we can determine whether it was raised,

4

whether criminal history points were raised from 10 to 13

5

because of something that he considered to be in the case,

6

the district court stated in the sentencing opinion, page

7

69 of the Joint Appendix is where you can find it, that

8

the serious criminal conduct in those arrests, that's the

9

arrests not resulting in convictions, that's what he's

10

referring to, coupled with convictions more than 15 years

11

old, that's what he's basing his upward departure on,

12

suggest to the court that the defendant's criminal history

13

was significantly more serious than that of most

14

defendants in category V, and the court accordingly added

15

three criminal history points to the previous criminal

16

history point calculation of 10, resulting in 13 criminal

17

history points.

18

facts.

19

He is raising it up because of those two

That's what he's saying.
QUESTION:

The court says elsewhere, the record

20

is replete with convictions, and even if we count to but 5

21

felony convictions the court has the belief that the 10

22

points assessed is insufficient for the 5 felonies, 2 of

23

which are outside the 15-year parameters.

MR. HANSON:

But he does say that that --he

said that, I don't deny that.

But he said also just what

I have said, that he is relying on those two factors for

the upward departure.

3

criminal history, there is no question about that, but he

4

is making the upward departure.

5

had been at 10.

6

why he's going to 13, because he is considering these

7

arrests not resulting in convictions and because of the

8

other factor which he has stated was convictions more than

9

15 years old.

The previous calculation

He said I'm going to 13, and he tells you

And he is doing it for that reason.

I don't think that you can assume that because

You agree it would be a different

case if he had mentioned one erroneous factor along with

17

No, no, I don't.

No, I don't.

Not

No.
QUESTION:

18

that's not your case.

19

MR. HANSON:

That's still the same case?

I mean,

Let's assume -Well, I don't -- I thought you

20

phrased it in a hypothetical that if there were that

21

situation, just one improper factor and two or three good

22

factors, then he would have authority in his own way of

23

doing things justifying what he did.

true.

I don't think that's

Now, a sentencing hearing is not a big thing.

You can do a sentencing hearing in one afternoon in a

he actually did, has been proven against him.

When I sent Williams the copy of the opinion,

8

Misstreata, 109 Supreme Court 647 at 652, this Court

9

stated the following.

The Sentence Reform Act of 1984

10

makes the Sentencing Commission guidelines binding on the

11

courts although it preserves for the judge the discretion

12

to depart from the guidelines applicable to a particular

13

case if the judge finds an aggravating or mitigating

14

factor is present that the Commission did not adequately

15

consider for formulating, when formulating the guidelines.

16

In other words they are saying that which has

17

been determined by the guidelines is binding on this

18

Court, but it is only in an aggravating and mitigating

19

circumstance in regard to a factor that the Sentencing

20

Commission did not consider in creating the guidelines

21

that permits this departure.

QUESTION:

That's --

Let's assume we accept your argument

Isn't it fair to say here that one of the values

that we want to preserve is the value of kind of an active

informed discretion on the part of the trial judges?

Well, that's true.

of the test looks to what the sentencing court actually

did, at least in the sense that if there is a positive

determination that the sentencing court would have done it

is they said well, if we can't make that positive

the mind of the district court.

Now, if you can't make that

It may be possible that

10

the district court would have done it differently if we

11

sent it back, but possible isn't good enough.

12

appellate court is going to step in and it is going to, in

Once

relevant -- pardon me, once you find it's reasonable it's
just not relevant.
MS. WAX:

Well, if the court finds that it's

unreasonable, even though it has passed the test of (1),
the sentence must go back.

So there is a second chance

for a remand, so to speak.

The court must remand if it

finds that the departure is nevertheless unreasonable even
though the court would have given it anyway.

So, for

example, suppose that the court decides that the factor,
the invalid factor, here an arrest record that a district
court relied on, didn't really affect the sentence, the
court would have given the same, would have made the
decision to depart anyway.

And suppose that the court

decides to depart by, oh, let's say 10 years instead of 3,
instead of 3 months as it did here.

Then the court has to

decide whether a 10-year departure is reasonable.

Now, on

this record a 10-year departure probably wouldn't be
reasonable, and in that case the sentence should go back.
So the reasonableness inquiry is mainly focused on the
degree of departure.
QUESTION:

Well, I'll study it.

It still seems

to me that section (1) would be adequate, that
section -- and you have, you have to go beyond, somewhat
beyond the statutory language anyway in order to reach
your result of harmless error.

that the 10 points assessed is insufficient for the five

severity of the record.
QUESTION:

2

And the court of appeals said that we

3

cannot say the consideration of these two convictions as

4

part of the overall assessment was inappropriate.

5
6

MS. WAX:

And that's, that's the valid

ground that the court of appeals found was --

7
8

Exactly.

QUESTION:

They just said the previous arrests

without convictions were not proper.

9

MS. WAX:

Right.

And in fact the passage you're

10

reading from on page 53 of the Joint Appendix if anything

11

helps us.

12

that looking at these five felonies including the valid

13

ground for departure alone we conclude that 10 points

14

isn't enough.

15

mentions the prior arrest record and then, without missing

16

a beat, says and we know that we can't rely on a prior

17

arrest record under the guidelines.

18

it spells out that this is not a valid ground for

19

departure, and we think that this is a record on which we

20

can say with confidence that the court would have done the

21

same thing if it had never taken note of the arrest

22

record.

quite reasonably concluded that it wouldn't take much -QUESTION:

That's 3 months in the upper reach,

though, isn't it?

4

MS. WAX:

Right.

From an upper sentence of 24,

or a ceiling sentence of 24 to a ceiling of 27, and the

6

court decided to sentence at the top of the guidelines

7

range.

8

9

Now, as we said, this is a very sensible system
of appellate review.

It's a pragmatic system because

10

there are 44,000 sentences a year that are doled out under

11

the Sentencing Reform Act, and Congress could logically

12

have an interest in not remanding a lot of sentences that

13

in fact were legitimate and valid and had a perfectly good

14

justification under the guidelines and in the record.

17

QUESTION:

Do you have any figures on how many

of those are appealed?
MS. WAX:

I'm sorry, we don't.

We do know that

18

there are almost three times as many downward departures

19

as there are upward departures.

20

were, the reading of 3742 that we're recommending, it's

21

quite evenhanded between downward and upward departures in

22

that it tends to minimize the number of mandatory remands.

23

And of course when the Government is appealing downward

24

departures we have an interest in maximizing the number of

25

mandatory remands.

judge himself relied upon --

Now what if

6

the court of appeals says well, there are other factors in

15

MS. WAX:

I take it you're not urging,

Well, yes and no.

Congress could have

designed a system like that, but it didn't.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. WAX:

Well, all right.
It designed a sort of hybrid system.

The first question is did the sentence result from an

19

incorrect application of the guidelines, can we determine

20

that it did?

21

has to evaluate the reasonableness of the departure that

22

was actually given, and when it does that there is nothing

23

in the statute that prevents the court of appeals at that

24

juncture from looking at the record as a whole, and maybe

perhaps looking at some other things --

that if the court of appeals says that the, here are a, b,
