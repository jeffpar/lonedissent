CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 90-1947, John K. Yee v. City of Escondido.
Mr. Jagiello, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. JAGIELLO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JAGIELLO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The tenant who sold the coach to Mrs. Morrison

11

in the Azul case got $77,000 for a $5,000 coach.

12

proved that trial in that case that it was the direct

13

result of vacancy control, could not have occurred without

14

vacancy control, and all the legal arguments in the world

15

can't disguise that fact.

16

Now how did it happen?

And we

It happened because the

17

rent control ordinance gives two sets of rights in the

18

property to the tenant in residence.

19

possessory, and the second relate to rents.

20

those possessory rights?

21

rate in perpetuity, and secondly, the right for the first

22

time to sell that right without the consent of the

23

landlord to an incoming tenant.

24

rents, the tenant receives the right to increase the

25

rents, to collect the increase, and to keep the proceeds

It's not a

The reality is - -

Well, is that what the ordinance

says, or you say it's just impractical?
MR. JAGIELLO:

No, what happens is that there's

12

a State system for going out of business that, in

13

conjunction with local ordinances, precludes that

14

alternative as a practical reality.

15

case where we have finished 4 years of administrative

16

hearings where we've just gotten the administrative

17

record, and the condition that they imposed to going out

18

of the business was that we pay the in-place value,

19

exactly the harm that we're talking about here.

20

we've got 3 or 4 more years of litigation while we try to

21

contest the constitutional validity of imposing a

condition of that nature upon us as a condition for our

going out of business.

QUESTION:

2

MR. JAGIELLO:

It's not the ordinance.
No, but it happens to be the case

3

that the local agency is given the right under State law

4

to impose the conditions, and it's the local agency that

5

then does impose the conditions.

QUESTION:

But it will be a practical

alternative if you win this other case, which I'm sure you

expect to win, right?

This is not the garden-variety police power case

QUESTION:

Is that other case in the appellate

courts or still before the agency?
MR. JAGIELLO:

We just got the administrative

record 4 years down the line, Your Honor, so we're filing
in the lower courts in California at this moment.

11

QUESTION:

It's not a reported case, then?

12

MR. JAGIELLO:

13

We're talking about a transfer of rights, not a

Not at this time, it is not.

14

garden-variety police-power case where there's a

diminution of the value of the property.

And as a consequence, we have to look to the

pleadings.

Those are the facts that are properly before

3

the Court.

And what do the pleadings tell us?

property that are transferred under the ordinance.

11

What is the city's defense to this claim?

12

Stripped of its sociology, it's basically this:

13

tenants own a portable structure which they bring onto my

14

client's land on wheels.

15

land, they put it on jacks.

16

or if it becomes obsolescence and the tenant decides to

17

remove it, they put wheels under it again and they haul it

18

off.

that the

And the city says, under the circumstances, this

20

is such a unique relationship that we are justified in

21

creating thousands of estates in land in transferring the

22

value to the tenants who own the portable structures.

And what are the justifications given for this

-- that is (1)

housing, and (2) it protects the investment.

We need to

1

examine this claim from a number of perspectives.

2

three Federal courts of appeal have held this to be a

3

physical taking because it is.

4

requires that we renew and that we cannot terminate any

5

leases for present tenants as well as prospective tenants.
QUESTION:

6

The local ordinance

Would you describe exactly what it is

7

that is the physical taking here?

8

trouble grasping that.
MR. JAGIELLO:

9

First,

Because I have a little

Yes, Your Honor, the ordinance by

10

itself achieves this effect.

You have -- prior to the

11

passage of the ordinance, the park owner has effective

12

ability to control who will get an invitation onto his

13

land.

14

Florida Power case that says it's the invitation that

15

makes the difference.

And if I could put this in context, it is the

And Loretto tells us the invitation has to be

16
17

offered by someone who has the authority to give the

18

invitation.

19

prior owner - - the cable company was not a stranger to the

20

premises.

21

Then Mrs. Loretto came on, bought the property, looked

22

around, told the cable company we're revoking your

23

invitation.

24

no problem in finding that continued occupancy under

25

compulsion of the law, was a physical per se taking.

As this Court will recall in Loretto, the

The prior owner had given consent to be there.

And under those circumstances, this Court had

Exactly the same thing occurs here.

1

The owner

2

remains the same, the tenants are different, and the

3

departing tenant who doesn't have the right but for the

4

law invites the incoming tenant in, who's then an

5

interloper with a Government license, and the ordinance

6

causes the owner to become disabled from controlling that

7

access.

And the way -QUESTION:

8

So you say the incoming tenant is the

9

one who is physically occupying the property against the

10

will of the owner, corresponding to the cable company in

11

Loretto?

12

MR. JAGIELLO:

Certainly the incoming tenant you

13

could obviously argue in a typical rent control case,

14

which this is not, that it's the holdover tenant as well.

15

But the incoming tenant has been invited onto the premises

16

by the departing tenant.

17

extend the invitation.

18

the park owner h^d the power and the right to control who

19

would get an invitation onto his property because he would

20

exercise that control by insisting that the incoming

21

tenant agree to rental terms.

22

did not agree to the rental terms, the park owner had

23

every right not to allow him onto the property or to

24

extend the invitation.

QUESTION:

He doesn't have the authority to

MR. JAGIELLO:

No, it's not, Your Honor, and

QUESTION:

But that's what they do.

They say

5

you can't keep people off your property or out of your

6

business just because you don't like their race, religion,

7

or nationality.

Is that taking?

MR. JAGIELLO:

8

kind of right here.

10

QUESTION:

I guessed you weren't, but tell me

11

why it's any different.

12

MR. JAGIELLO:

13

We're certainly not claiming that

Because there are overriding and

overarching values that are to be served.

14

QUESTION:

It becomes a taking if there's an

15

overarching -- it ceases to become a taking if there's an

16

overarching value?

17

I thought it was still a taking.

MR. JAGIELLO:

Well, it can be the case, of

18

course, that the person is there on the premises, but I

19

believe that we finally decided there are purposes that

20

are so substantial and overarching that we can require

21

that people be treated without being discriminated

22

against.

QUESTION:

Well, we've never held, so far as I

know, Mr. Jagiello, that where you're talking about a

physical taking, that the governmental purpose made any

9

Well, that's true.

Then how does your answer to Justice

Scalia make any sense?
MR. JAGIELLO:

10

Well, the problem that I'm facing

11

here is we are facing two fundamental kinds of rights that

12

collide with each other, and that case is not the case

13

that's presently before the Court.

in an instant the colliding of those particular rights.

don't know how that will come down when that becomes an

QUESTION:

And so I can't resolve

Well, can't you say that in an

anti-discrimination ordinance, something like an ordinary

does not have the power to determine the identity of the

in the anti-discrimination ordinance.

MR. JAGIELLO:

No, it's not.

Is the difference

In the case of the

10

physical taking, it could well be the case that there'd be

11

insignificant loss of value, and it still would be a

12

physical taking.

13

The difference is that we're making --

QUESTION:

So we're not concerned here with the

14

extent to which the economic expectations and the economic

15

real values of the owner are affected?

16

MR. JAGIELLO:

Well, we're concerned, of course,

17

if we look at it as a regulatory taking, which I'll

18

discuss in a few minutes, but we are not concerned with it

19

if it's viewed, as the three lower courts of appeal viewed

20

it, as physical taking, because there the economic

21

consequences are not particularly relevant in resolving

22

the issue of whether or not the -- the conduct is

23

unconstitutional.

24

QUESTION:

25

sort of a background question.

Also, can I ask one question?

It's

1

of the restrictions that make ownership costly in this

2

area are imposed by a statute, the California Mobilehome

3

Residency Law.

And I understand you haven't challenged

4

that statute.

Is it your position that if that statute

5

were repealed entirely that you would still have just as

6

strong a case?

7

MR. JAGIELLO:

Oh, of course, because the

8

ordinance itself provides for rent control and eviction

control.

It states that we cannot refuse to renew, nor

10

can we terminate any lease for present tenants or any

11

prospective purchasers as to all spaces not covered by the

12

right to invite the tenant on without a veto power of any

kind over the park owner, and the landowner is stripped of

2

is that the massive loss of control that he experienced by-

3

being able to say to somebody, unless we come to terms

that are agreeable, you can't come on has been transferred

5

to the tenant, and the park owner himself has been

stripped of his right and his power.

* QUESTION:

But the plain fact

But in an ordinary rent control

8

ordinance, which you say you don't challenge, and which

9

the court has upheld, the landowner, the landlord does not

10

have the right to insist on rental terms that he wishes to

11

impose.

12

MR. JAGIELLO:

But what he can do is he can

13

still distribute the benefits in a variety of ways.

14

could give the apartment with its rent control benefits to

15

his friends, to his relatives.

16

distribution of the benefits, and he doesn't have to

accept onto premises any particular tenant as long as he

18

has a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis for doing so.

19

He

He controls the

But here, the landlord can no longer exclude.

20

He has lost the right to exclude, and the ordinance

21

transfers that right, and thus, it's a physical taking.

With respect to the

QUESTION:

24

MR. JAGIELLO:

25

To whom was that right transferred?
It was transferred to the tenant,

in by selling his coach.
QUESTION:

So the transfer is between landlord

and tenant, not with the City of Escondido.
MR. JAGIELLO:

The City of Escondido didn't get

the transfer; it causes the transfer.

It didn't get the

transferred value.
We can also look at takings as a continuum, with
Loretto on the one end and Agins on the other, and ask
ourselves, where we have an expropriation of the right to
impose rent increases, collect the rent increases, and
keep them, and transfer that right over to the departing
tenant, have we reached that point that Hodel v.. Irving
tells us, that we have a fundamental attribute of property
which is expropriated or extinguished?

We believe so, and

it's a taking.
Let's look at Mrs. Morrison's case again.

The

tenant got $77,000, which with a cap rate of 10, comes out
to about $650 a month.

Her rent was $340.

He took

two-thirds of the rent due to the property, pocketed it,
and left the premises.

And we submit that under those

circumstances, that is an out and out expropriation of
property and a taking under the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

But is that different -- I can

remember back many years ago during rent control when the
tenant could get a lot of money for the furniture when

1

Well, first of all, you know,

this case is here on the pleadings, and those aren't the

facts that are part of the record, and they hypothesize

that as a purpose.

a certain value, a box value, that's determined by

traditional methods of evaluation, like the Kelley Blue

But the reality is that the coach has

But that's all the tenant owns.

So the maximum exposure that the tenant faces,

9
10

as pointed out in Hirsch v. Hirsch article, is the cost of

11

moving.

12

$1,500, translates into a $12.50 rent increase per month.

13

That's the maximum leverage that the landlord has over the

tenant under those circumstances.

15

give a $77,000 estate in land in order to protect against

I think as well, and somewhat on point there, is

19

that their argument also is a new wrinkle that high rents

Hirsch v. Hirsch, that no coaches are selling for below

He wants

6

And third, it violates the close-fit notions of

7

Nollan in any event because if you're concerned about the

park owner depressing prices so that he can buy the coach,

pass a law that says something like the park owner can

there would be no serious constitutional issue posed.

Petitioners, prior to this argument, seemed to have

10

conceded because they did not challenge the State statute

11

itself, that California's residency law, which requires

12

park owners to permit homeowners to sell their homes in

place and to lease those properties to an incoming home

purchaser, is itself not unconstitutional.

that this Court has summarily affirmed in the past.

QUESTION:

I understood him to say that the same

20

Do I misunderstand that?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

He did say that.

with that argument, Justice Stevens, is that the rent

Where petitioners, I think, now urge the Court

11

to draw the constitutional line is when these two forms of

otherwise perfectly permissible regulation overlap.

13

in that case, their argument is that this is no longer

14

even a more serious regulatory takings issue under the

15

Fifth Amendment, but that these two forms of regulation

16

are mystically converted into an occupation of physical

property, and therefore, requires per se condemnation

This leads me to the second flaw in the

And that is that they do not have

Of course, the

2

difficulty that that poses is that that same right to

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I - - with all respect, no,

Your Honor, I don't believe that's an issue for trial.
Because if the State government or the local government
makes a judgment that there are individuals within their
jurisdiction who require protection -- and that is
precisely what this initiative and ordinance were designed
to accomplish, and there's no dispute about that part of
it; that's what it was intended to accomplish -- it is not
the providence of a jury years later to conclude, based on
economic theories propounded by the petitioners and their
hired counsel to say that the legislature was wrong.

You say that is not subject to any

sort of review in the courts.

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think it is much more difficult

10

for me to envision the notion that a jury would come back

11

after the fact and conclude that the evidence before the

12

legislators was insufficient to support the legislative

13

judgment and that that's a basis upon which to declare

14

legislative acts unconstitutional.

15

I do agree with you that under Nollan and other

takings cases that look for a substantial relationship

17

between the means and the ends chosen, that is subject to

a serious inquiry.

the Nollan issue has been preserved and in this case at
