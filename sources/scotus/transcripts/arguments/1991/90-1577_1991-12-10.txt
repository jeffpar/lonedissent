CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in 90-1577, United States v. R. L. C.

Mr. Larkin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LARKIN:

8

9

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves an interpretation of the

10
11

Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act in the Sentencing Reform

12

Act of 1984.

13

provision under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act.

14

That statute provides in part as follows, and is reprinted

15

at page 2 of our opening brief:

16

official detention may be ordered for a juvenile found to

17

be a juvenile delinquent may not extend, in the case of a

18

juvenile who is less than eighteen years old, beyond the

19

lesser of the date when the juvenile becomes twenty-one

20

years old; or" -- and here is the pivotal part of the

21

statute -- "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be

22

authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as

23

an adult."

24
25

At issue is the meaning of the commitment

QUESTION:
said or.

"The term for which

it?

2

MR. LARKIN:

3

QUESTION:

Well -You know it's poorly drafted.

It

4

should be lesser of something and something, not lesser of

5

something or something.

6

MR. LARKIN:

If they poorly drafted it by

7

putting in the or, they at least drafted what comes after

8

the or with sufficient clarity, we believe, to make clear

9

that the Eighth Circuit misread it in this case.

10

The question here is whether that part - - the

11

last part of the statute that I just read, the maximum

12

term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the

13

juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult -- is

14

the statutory maximum term authorized by Congress or is

15

the maximum sentence that can be imposed under the

16

sentencing guidelines.

17

Put another way, the question in this case is

18

whether the sentencing guidelines fix the maximum term of

19

imprisonment, even though the sentencing guidelines

20

themselves do not apply to juvenile delinquency

21

proceedings.

22

QUESTION:

Another way to put it I suppose,

23

Mr. Larkin, is whether the sentencing guidelines authorize

24

a term of imprisonment any higher -- or whether the judge

25

is authorized to impose a sentence in excess of that

permitted by the sentencing guidelines.
MR. LARKIN:

2

Well, the judge is always

3

authorized to impose a sentence if the statute allows a

4

sentence of imprisonment to be imposed, but 5037, in our

5

view, does not in any way incorporate the sentencing

6

guidelines.

7

QUESTION:

No, that isn't my question.

Is a

8

sentence - - is a district -- say you've got a case in

9

which the maximum sentence is 3 years, but the maximum

10

sentence upder the sentencing guidelines would be 2 years,

11

is a district judge authorized to impose a sentence of

12

more than 2 years?

QUESTION:

MR. LARKIN:

QUESTION:

17

MR. LARKIN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
Oh, he is?
We clearly think the statute -Wouldn't it be reversible error?
The statute authorizes -No, I understand the statute

19

authorizes, but is the judge authorized to impose more

20

than 2 years in that hypothesis?
MR. LARKIN:

21

Yes, because the statute is what

22

governs in this case, not the sentencing guidelines at

23

all.

QUESTION:

But would it not be reversible?

2

Oh, I'm sorry.

My - - I thought you

were referring to juveniles.

3

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

I'm talking about an

4

adult.

I'm saying in the case of an adult, would the

5

judge be authorized to impose a sentence of more than

6

2 years?

7
8

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.

That is still true, but the

reason is -- is a little different.
QUESTION:

I understand, but the question -- the

10

simple question, yes or no question, would the judge be

11

authorized to impose a sentence of more than 2 years?
MR. LARKIN:

12

Yes, the answer is yes.

The reason

13

is, the guidelines do not provide authority to impose a

14

sentence.

15

between the way we look at the statute and the way the

16

court of appeals did.

17
18

We think that's an important distinction

QUESTION:

But you would agree it would be

reversible error were the judge to do that.

MR. LARKIN:

No, I would not, because the

1

QUESTION:

You're saying there would not be

2

reversible error for a judge to impose a sentence higher

3

than authorized by the sentencing guidelines?

4

MR. LARKIN:

5

response to what you just said.

6

necessarily be reversible error, and secondly, the

7

guidelines do not authorize the sentence to be imposed.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, I would say two things in
First, it would not

I understand that argument, but why

wouldn't it be reversible error?
MR. LARKIN:

Because if you look to 18 U.S.C.

11

section 3553, subsection (b), it says that a district

12

court should impose a sentence within the guidelines range

13

that the Commission has set out, unless the Commission --

14

excuse me, the district court were to find an aggravating

15

or mitigating factor --

16

QUESTION:

No, but I'm assuming a situation in

17

which you make all the proper analysis and you either

18

conclude there is no aggravating circumstance, or you

19

conclude that, even with the aggravating circumstance

20

included, a proper application of the sentencing

21

guidelines, the maximum that the -- judge -- the sentence

22

the judge could impose would be 2 years, and you're

23

telling me he is authorized to impose a higher sentence.

24
25

MR. LARKIN:

I would say yes, because the term

authorized here is one we use - 7

QUESTION:

1
2

Would you also say it was not

reversible error to do so?

3

MR. LARKIN:

No, if -- under those

4

circumstances, it would be an error to impose that

5

sentence in this case, but it would still be a sentence

6

that would be authorized.

7
8

QUESTION:

So you're saying he's authorized to

commit reversible error.

9

MR. LARKIN:

No.

A judge who imposes a

10

sentence, for example, without first giving the defendant

11

the opportunity to engage in - QUESTION:

12

No, no, no, no.

Forget all the

13

procedures.

14

sentencing is accurately computed, as the maximum under

15

the guidelines is 2 years, and I thought you said if he

16

imposed more it would be reversible error.

17

All the procedures are complied with.

MR. LARKIN:

The

It would be an error, but it would

18

not -- but it's, we think, an incorrect use of the term,

19

authorized.
QUESTION:

20

Well, I understand all that.

I'm

21

just trying to get an understanding of what -- but you

22

would agree that it would be reversible error if he did

23

it.

24

MR. LARKIN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
But you are therefore saying he is

MR. LARKIN:

Your Honor, I will be glad to go along with you.

4

QUESTION:

That's all I wanted -- it was

rather obvious, but I had a hard time getting out of you.

6

You're a very good lawyer.
MR. LARKIN:

Let me continue just -- and briefly

8

summarize the facts and procedural posture, because both

9

are very simple.
Shortly after midnight on the evening of

10
11

November 5, 1989, LeTesha Mountain was killed when the

12

automobile in which she was driving was hit from the rear

13

by a stolen automobile, driven by respondent.

14

district court, after a hearing at which respondent was

15

represented by counsel, concluded that his conduct

16

amounted to involuntary manslaughter and that respondent

17

was a juvenile delinquent.

The

There followed a commitment hearing at which the

18
19

district court considered a variety of matters such as

20

respondent's drinking problem, the possibility of his

21

rehabilitation, and the juvenile facilities available for

22

detention.

23

sentenced respondent to 36 months' confinement.

24
25
\

Okay.

7

\

If you want to put it that way,

After that hearing, the district court

On appeal, the Eighth Circuit vacated the
sentence and remanded it for resentencing.

The court

1

acknowledged that the sentencing guidelines did not apply

2

to juvenile delinquency adjudications.

3

nonetheless ruled that using the sentencing guidelines to

4

define the maximum sentence that could be imposed on the

5

juvenile under section 5037 would eliminate any

6

unwarranted disparities that could arise between the

7

sentencing of juveniles and adults in the Federal courts

8

today.

9

The court

The Eighth Circuit believes that the legislative

10

history of.the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984

11

made clear that Congress didn't intend for such

12

disparities to exist.

13
14
15

Finally, the Eighth Circuit also relied on the
Rule of Lenity.
Now, we believe that the Eighth Circuit misread

16

the statute.

17

statute, the phrase dealing with the maximum term of

18

imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile were

19

tried and convicted as an adult, refers to the statutory

20

maximum term and not to the maximum sentence that would

21

have been imposed under the sentencing guidelines.

22

think part of the reason - -

23

In our view, the pivotal part of the

QUESTION:

And we

Well, Mr. Larkin, why do we have two

24

separate things, a statutory maximum and sentencing

25

guidelines?

Were they -- was the statutory maximum

enacted before the sentencing guidelines came into effect?
MR. LARKIN:

2

The statutory -- yes, Your Honor,

3

the statutory maximum for involuntary manslaughter is

4

3 years.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LARKIN:

>

When was that enacted by Congress?
I don't know the precise year, but

7

I know it was before November 1 of 1 87, which is the date

8

that the sentencing guidelines went into effect.

My guess

is the statutory maximum, Your Honor, would have been
10

enacted a very long time ago because it's part of the

11

series of laws dealing with homicide, which probably

12

extend back into the 1 th century at some point.

13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, that really is your very simple

issue in the case.
MR. LARKIN:

It is, Your Honor.

We think it's a

simple and straightforward issue.
We think that it is erroneous to look at the

18

statute in the way the court of appeals did.

1

Circuit assumed that the sentencing guidelines authorized

20

the maximum term of imprisonment that could be imposed,

21

but the sentencing guidelines do not authorize punishment

22

to be imposed at all.

24

criminal law, one stated in this Court's very first

Hudson and Goodwin, is that only an act of Congress can

authorize imprisonment as the punishment for crime.

When Congress adopted the Sentencing Reform Act - -

QUESTION:

was that the authority is in one place and the guidelines

are just a limitation upon that authority, but that's not

different person, not the Congress personally?

You're relying upon the fact that it's a

MR. LARKIN:

10

No, Your Honor.

My point -- I

11

think I haven't changed it -- is that it is an act of

12

Congress that can authorize imprisonment, and when

13

Congress used that term in conjunction with, for example,

14

the maximum term of imprisonment, what the statute is most

15

naturally read to refer to is the maximum term of

16

imprisonment authorized by a statute, since it's only a

17

statute that can authorize imprisonment.

18

do not authorize imprisonment in that respect.

19
20

QUESTION:

Yes, but they do limit the authority

of the judge to impose sentences, don't they?
MR. LARKIN:

21
22

The guidelines

They establish procedures that the

judges must go through --

23

QUESTION:

They also impose limits.

They impose

limits on the period of time that can be imposed, don't

they?

MR. LARKIN:

1

In that sense they limit the

2

judge's proper exercise of the authority that is given him

3

by the statute, but it is still --

4
5

QUESTION:

don't they limit the scope of his authority?
MR. LARKIN:

6

7

They can limit the scope of his

authority in the way that we discussed earlier.
QUESTION:

8

9

But don't they limit the scope -- or

Sure.

They limit it to 2 years

instead of 3.
MR. LARKIN:

10

But it is still, we think,

11

incorrect to look at having - - that the district court is

12

vested with that authority by virtue of the guidelines.

13

It works in the other direction.

14

district court that authority long before the guidelines

15

came into existence, and the guidelines are simply

16

designed to regularize the process of exercising that

17

authority.

18

QUESTION:

The statutes gave the

If you had a statute that said you

19

get 10 years for a particular crime and then you have a

20

later statute that says, however, if the crime is-

21

committed on a Sunday 10 years will not be imposed; you

22

can only impose 5, then it would be the 10-year statute

23

that authorizes the penalty and we would disregard for

24

purposes of this provision the 5-year statute, because

25

that just limits the prior authority.

MR. LARKIN:

1

Well, in both case, Your Honor, the

2

common denominator was they were both statutes, and

3

Congress, if it wants to, can say, I'm authorizing you to

10 years, and in a second statute, I'm authorizing you to

QUESTION:

They're both

That's what I said before.

You're

relying on the difference between Congress and the

10

Commission, not on the difference between authorizing and

limiting an authorization.

Well, the latter, Your Honor, I

think is reflected in the former.

21

that Congress has posed - -

QUESTION:

And I suppose that while the judge is

free to escalate the term beyond the norm if there's an

aggravating circumstance, he can't go above the maximum

term set by statute.

MR. LARKIN:

1

Correct.

As a matter of fact, this

2

Court made that point in the Mistretta case in a passage

3

that we have quoted on page 13 of our opening brief.

4

Court there made clear, as the statutes themselves made

5

clear, that every sentence the Sentencing Commission

6

designates as a sentencing range must be within the range

7

of sentences that Congress has authorized in the statutes

8

that form title 18 and the other parts of the United

The

States Code.

10

Mr. Larkin, it really seems to me you

can use authorize either the way you're using it or the

way Justice Stevens is using it.

permit.

MR. LARKIN:

QUESTION:

I mean, it's

But it is not -Just make believe that I think it's

18

-- that it bears both meanings, okay.

1

why shouldn't I apply the Rule of Lenity and say, you

20

know, where you can bear either meaning you take the more

21

lenient meaning.

22

MR. LARKIN:

If I believe that,

Because that's not the most natural

23

meaning of the statute.

The meaning we've put forward is

24

the one this Court has used in its own cases, as we've

25

mentioned in our brief.

1

While it may be true that the term "authorized,"

2

if you will, has within it a broad range of meanings, the

3

one we're putting forward is the most natural one, and

4

it's the most -- particularly the most natural one when

5

you look at the clause as a whole.

6

maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized.

7

QUESTION:

It refers to the

But you're assuming it reads as

8

though it were written "would be authorized by statute."

9

If they'd put the words "by statute" in, there could be no

10
11
12

13
14
15

doubt about the meaning.
MR. LARKIN:

Well, there is always a possibility

of making any statute clearer.
QUESTION:

Well, not the one I've drafted.

You

can't make it any clearer than I've just made it.
MR. LARKIN:

Well, the one -- their version of

16

the statute should read as follows:

17

should not impose a sentence greater than the same

18

sentence that would have been imposed on an adult, if he

19

had been tried and convicted as an adult.

20

QUESTION:

the district court

No, not that would have been imposed.

21

Then the judge could have imposed without committing

22

reversible error.

23
24
25

MR. LARKIN:

Or that could have imposed without

committing reversible error, if you will.
QUESTION:

Right, which is quite different from

2

MR. LARKIN:

Well, and that we think strengthens

3

our interpretation a little bit, because what you're

referring to is the possibility, the range -- the sentence

that Congress had set forward that existed prior to

November 1 of 1987 and prior to 1984 when the Sentencing

almost 100 years there have been two types of criminal

justice systems.

that's reflected here in the sections beginning with 50 --

QUESTION:

No, but it seems rather anomalous to

say they wanted uniformity of sentencing across the board

with one exception, that juveniles can get a more severe

that argument.

Well, Your Honor, respondents made

We think they're assuming the conclusion.

They're assuming that Congress wanted uniformity across

11

Congress did not.
Congress, for example, in section

subsection (a)(1 ) of title 28, which deals with the

14

powers of the Sentencing Commission, said that the.

regard.

That is not simply one

It also represents the fact that Congress was

After all, you had a discretionary sentencing

23

system before for juveniles and for adults, and Congress

24

saw that there were terrible problems that had arisen in

25

the adult criminal justice system.

It decided that a

sentencing guidelines mechanism was the way of reducing

2

those disparities, and it directed the Commission to adopt

3

a sentencing guidelines system to eliminate those

4

disparities.

5

But this section I've just cited to you, which

6

is excerpted in footnote 1 in our opening brief at pages

7

10 to 11, is strong proof that Congress didn't believe

8

that it needed at that time to address the problems of the
juvenile justice system.

That's one of the reasons that

10

Congress is - - indicated that juvenile justice system

11

sentencing mechanisms with only one minor modification

12

should remain as they were.

13

The minor modification is a second reason why

14

the guidelines don't apply.

15

1537(a) of title 18, one of the sections -- subsections

16

immediately preceding the one I quoted, you'll see that

17

Congress said that at juvenile commitment proceedings a

18

district court should consider any pertinent policy

statements that the Sentencing Commission has adopted, and

20

to date the Commission hasn't adopted any.

QUESTION:

If you look to section

Mr. Larkin, that second statute that

22

you refer to on page 11 in the footnote, I agree with you

that it does make it clear that the Congress did not

intend the guidelines to apply to juveniles, but that's

not the issue here, that the guidelines will apply to

Well, it's not quite different,

At most, it's only slightly different, for

First, as I've tried to summarize, what it does
indicate is that Congress left alone the juvenile
sentencing mechanisms so that it could address that at a

10

future date if Congress desired to, perhaps after the

11

Sentencing Commission has come forward with a study

12

showing that it is -- is or is not feasible to have a

13

guideline sentencing system just for juveniles.

14

After all, there are caps that apply to the

15

juvenile sentences that can be imposed that don't apply in

16

the case of adults, so you have at least half of the

17

possible sentences that could be imposed under the

18

sentencing guidelines, or more than half, that don't apply

in the case of a juvenile.

today.
If you look to the statute as it was adopted in

1984, you will see that it included three additional words

that aren't there today.

of imprisonment that would be authorized by section 3581.

QUESTION:

7

MR. LARKIN:

It referred to the maximum term

Yes.
That was put in there because

8

section 3581 is the new section that says imprisonment can

9

be authorized for adult offenders.

10

Now, that three-word phrase came out later to

11

eliminate an anomaly that could have arisen by virtue of

12

the fact that that specific statute was mentioned in the

13

1984 act, but as we've explained in our brief, Congress

14

took that three-word phrase out in order to make sure that

15

juveniles would not receive a longer maximum sentence to

which they would be exposed rather than just to cap the

17

sentence that a juvenile could receive as being the

18

sentence that would be imposed under the sentencing

19

guidelines.

20

We think that the statute as a whole, as well as

21

the different policies that Congress could have had in

22

mind, which was we think addressing this at a later date

after it had gotten the advice of the Sentencing

MR. LARKIN:

I consider that a significant

I didn't say it wasn't significant,

dispositive in respondent's direction, because if you look

11

at the reason why they took that out, and if you look at

12

what is left, we think it still as a whole refers to the

maximum punishment authorized by statute because it is

only Congress that can authorize a maximum punishment, and

what we are arguing is the language, the maximum term of

imprisonment authorized, has to be the same as an adult,

The thing that has changed is how we

Before the sentencing guidelines were

argument well, you would have paroled -- you would have

given an adult probation here?
MS. ROE:

13

No, Your Honor, I don't believe it

would have been, because they would have still been

subject to the same maximum term of imprisonment, because

16

prior to the sentencing guidelines you determine what the

QUESTION:

So although the rule you speak for is

that -- and a juvenile could never have received a higher

saying is that the juvenile couldn't be subjected to a

Because they'd both be applying the

It's just that the

perhaps to sentence a juvenile to a higher sentence and an

QUESTION:

MS. ROE:

QUESTION:

But absent aggravating circumstances,

it could never go up.
MS. ROE:

Only, Your Honor, if the person had --

was probably a very significant criminal history, then the

10

possibility exists that they could come very close to the

11

statutory maximum, if not reach it.

12

QUESTION:

Is there some reason why as a matter

13

of policy Congress would not have wanted the juvenile to

14

be subjected to this process of determining whether upward

15

departures are required, because that's what -- for

16

instance, in this case there was a stolen automobile which

17

was not included in the manslaughter offense.

I think

18

that may be a reason for an upward departure.

Is there

19

some policy reason why the Congress would not have

20

subjected the juvenile -- want -- would not have wanted

21

the juvenile to be subjected to this process?

question, Justice Kennedy.

MS. ROE:

All right.
I'm not sure that it would be.
Then your question I believe is, is

6

there any reason why Congress would not want to subject a

7

juvenile to this proceeding?

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. ROE:

Yes.
No, Your Honor, I don't believe so.

I

10

think that.it's more likely that the Congress would not

11

want to subject a juvenile to a harsher penalty than an

12

adult would receive, and I think that that's been

13

consistent with their policies from 1938, when they first

14

enacted the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act.

15

believe that's also consistent with the changes that they

16

made when they drafted the Comprehensive Crime Control Act

17

and made changes to the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act

18

as part of those --as part of that.
QUESTION:

I suppose the district judge would

20

have in front of him all of the history and all of the

21

factors that would be taken into account in the guidelines

anyway.

That's correct, and Your Honor, when

the case did go back for resentencing, the district judge

did not find any aggravating circumstances or any grounds

MS. ROE:

He was released over 9 months ago,

Your Honor.

My understanding of the law, sir, is that if

he would lose, the court would have it within its power to

him to - - and send him back for an additional 18 months

QUESTION:

What's your guess as to what Judge

MacLaughlin might do?
MS. ROE:

Well, Your Honor, it's hard to say,

but certainly when he went back on remand for resentencing

circumstances, and that the circumstances had changed, and

guidelines anyway?

6

MS. ROE:

Why would it say that if he has to apply the

Your Honor, I think that

7

subsection (a) essentially addresses a different interest.

8

What subsection (a) addresses is that they want the court

9

to look towards the guidelines, or the policy statements,

10

to determine or help the court to determine what the

11

sentence should be, and what the appropriate sentence

12

should be.
In subsection (c), where they actually talk

13
14

about what the maximum term a juvenile can receive is, I

15

think at that point then the .judge is looking at something

16

different.

different concerns.

part of the comprehensive Crime Control Act.

2

The amendments were part of the act, and they

3

may have believed -- they may have incorrectly believed

4

that everyone would understand what they were referring

5

to, because clearly after the Comprehensive Crime Control

6

Act was passed and the guidelines became effective, the

7

sentencing guidelines determined and limited the sentence

8

that an adult would receive, and the language I believe in
the statute is very clear.
The maximum term of imprisonment that would be

10
11

authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as

12

an adult.

13

convicted as an adult the sentencing guidelines would

14

limit the sentence that a court could impose, and if the

15

court imposed a sentence in excess of the sentence that

16

the sentencing guidelines authorized, then it would be

17

reversible error under U.S.C. 3742.

No question, if the juvenile had been tried and

QUESTION:

Just going back to (a) for a minute,

isn't the more normal reading of that that that refers to

sentencing guidelines -- Commission policy statements that

were contemplated by Congress but that have never actually

been written?

Isn't that a possible reading?

Sentencing Commission would develop policy statements for

2

juvenile offenders but they've never gotten around to

3

doing it.

4

but isn't that a possible reading?

5

I'm not sure that cuts either way in the case,

MS. ROE:

It's a possible reading, Your Honor.

6

I'm not sure that I would ascribe to that reading.

I

7

think that what they're talking about is that they wanted

8

the court to look at the -- excuse me, to look at the

9

policy statements and determine what the reasons might be

10

for sentencing a certain person to a certain amount of

11

time, not necessarily what the maximum was, because that

12

would come later in subsection (c), but in (a) just to

13

look at the policy statements to determine what Congress'

14

thoughts were and what the Sentencing Commission's

15

thoughts were when they enacted these guidelines.

16

QUESTION:

I was going to suggest something

17

else, and that was to focus on the word "pertinent."

18

Doing that, you would say well, the sentence in (a) in

19

effect was saying look, we're not importing every possible

20

policy statement that might be applicable in adult

21

circumstances, but you should at least winnow through them

22

and winnow out the ones that would be pertinent to a

23

juvenile proceeding and consider them.

24

So that that would be consistent both with the

25

theory that they were not subjecting juvenile sentencing

1

to the guidelines across the board, or indeed to the

2

guideline philosophy across the board, but they were doing

3

so if the sentencing court could figure out on a selective

4

basis what might be applicable in a juvenile case and tell

5

them to consider that, and of course ultimately, on your

6

theory, be subject to the cap of the highest possible

7

adult sentence.

8

9

Does that make sense?

MS. ROE:

I think that's also a possible

interpretation, Justice Souter.

I haven't seen anything

10

in the legislative history or in any other documentation

11

that indicates exactly what their intent was, but I think

12

that all those are possible interpretations.

13

The Government argues that sentencing

14

guidelines -- essentially the sentencing guidelines cannot

15

authorize a sentence, and I think that -- or it appears,

16

based on the Court's decision in Mistretta, that the

17

sentencing guidelines do authorize a sentence, because

18

this Court recognized in Mistretta that there was a

19

delegation of authority to the Sentencing Commission, a

20

broad delegation of authority, and that the authority that

21

was delegated was the authority to formulate binding

22

sentencing guidelines, and that there would be determinate

23

ranges, that the guidelines would be mandatory --a judge

24

would have no choice but to impose them -- and that if the

25

judge did not impose them there was a provision written
39

1

right into the act that it would be reversible error.
So clearly the practical and legal effects of

2

3

the guidelines are that they create an enforceable

4

provision and they set .limits that are below the statutory

5

limits, and I believe the Government's interpretation of

6

the word authorized and the fact that the sentencing

7

guidelines are not authorized fails to take that into

8

account.

9

Our position is and has been since the beginning

10

that this statute is not ambiguous.

11

have said what the Government reads the statute to have

12

said, but it doesn't say that, and maybe one of the most

13

important things is that at one time it did make a

14

reference to statutory maximum, and that reference was

15

deleted by Congress.

16

that that reference was deleted before this statute ever

17

became effective.

18

Clearly, they could

And I think it's important to know

So the statute, whereas it may have once

19

referred to the statutory maximum, it never referred to

20

the statutory maximum when it became effective.

21

time it became effective, that language was gone.

22

At the

We do not believe this is an ambiguous statute,

23

but if the Court determines that it is an ambiguous

24

statute, I think that the Court must apply the Rule of

25

Lenity as did the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, because

1

in this case to not apply the Rule of Lenity would place

2

the respondent in a position where essentially he would be

3

punished because this Court has to guess - - albeit an

4

educated guess, but would have to guess as to what

5

Congress intended.

6

established that if the Court has to guess, then it should

7

guess in favor of the person, the individual, and it

8

should guess in favor of the shorter sentence.

And the Rule of Lenity has long

QUESTION:

Could we apply the Rule of Lenity to

10

authorize sentences as well as to these substantive

11

elements of crimes?
MS. ROE:

12

13

is no.

14

that is yes.

Your Honor, I think the answer to that

Well, let me rephrase that.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. ROE:

I think the answer to

That is a rephrasing.
I think this case, Your Honor, is not

18

that inconsistent with the Chapman case, because in the

1

Chapman case where the Court did not apply the Rule of

20

Lenity, the Court said that when Congress wants to say

21

something, they know how to say it, and if they don't say

22

it, then we can assume that they didn't mean it.

23

think that that's analogous with our case, because

24

Congress clearly knew how to say it if they meant

25

statutory maximum, and as I indicated earlier they did say

it at one point, but they deleted it.
QUESTION:

Did we speak of the Rule of Lenity in

so many words in the Chapman opinion?

Your discussion in the Chapman

opinion, Your Honor, is very brief.
QUESTION:

Well, but I think you can answer that

7

question fairly specifically if you remember the Chapman

8

opinion, which I don't.

Did we speak of the Rule of

Lenity in so many words in that case?

QUESTION:

12

MS. ROE:

Yes, Your Honor, you did.
We did, okay.
Yes, Your Honor, you did.

In that

13

case, Your Honor, you held that the case was not -- or,

14

the statute was not ambiguous, and I don't believe the

15

statute is ambiguous in this case, but if the Court does

16

believe that the statute is ambiguous, I think you must

17

find in the favor of the shorter construction, the one

18

that's been urged by the -- or, the one that was applied

by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the one that's

urged by the respondent in this case.

application of the Rule of Lenity to sentencing, as

MS. ROE:

4

I'm sorry.

I'd appreciate --

I misunderstood the

question.
I think the closest case I would be able to cite

5
6

for that is U.S. v. Bifulco, and that was in fact a

7

sentencing case, Your Honor, and in that case the Court

8

said you can't increase the penalty -- it was a United

9

States Supreme Court case, where it said you can't

10

increase the penalty for an individual if all you can do

11

is guess as to what Congress intended.

12

applied it to sentencing.
QUESTION:

So yes, you have

Is that in your brief?

Is that cited
