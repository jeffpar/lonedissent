Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This case addresses the applicability of the

14

this case deals with 5 U.S.C. Section 504, that prong of

the EAJA that applies to administrative proceedings.

•

The EAJA provides broadly for protection for people who
have been subjected to severe agency misconduct.

And of

3

all the possible Government agencies, and of all the

4

possible agency proceedings, deportation proceedings are

5

the ones that most specifically meet the EAJA context.

6

They're the ones where the most harsh consequences meted

7

out by any agency are meted out - - consequences that may

8

be tantamount to banishment or exile, or in the words of

9

Justice Brandeis,

"the loss of life and property and all

10

that makes life worth living."

This is particularly so in

11

the context of asylum where, as here, it had been

12

determined that the refugee would be subjected to

13

persecution.

14

Moreover, persons in deportation proceedings are

15

the very people for whom the remedial measures of the EAJA

16

most perfectly are met.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Soloway, I mean, that's

18

all -- yes, I mean, it's very sympathetic, but the fact is

19

even in criminal trials, when someone is wrongly

20

prosecuted, and it turns out there was no basis for the

21

prosecution, EAJA does not reimburse the wrongfully

22

prosecuted criminal defendant.

23

hundreds of thousands of dollars on his defense, he's not

24

reimbursed, is he?

MR. SOLOWAY:

Although he may have spent

10

applies, are those that are under Section 554.

17

correct meaning of the definition "under Section 554,"

it's necessary for this Court to look at the entire

19

statutory scheme.

20

of a statute is not an inert exercise in grammatical or

21

literary composition.

22

was the EAJA statute about.

23

it's important to understand the way that deportation

24

hearings are precisely those that fit that statutory

25

scheme.

This Court has held that interpretation

QUESTION:

I don't know.

QUESTION:

Of. course the Sixth Amendment right

to counsel is not a right to have counsel paid for.
MR. SOLOWAY:

Well, I'm talking about appointed

counsel, yes, Your Honor.
Your Honor, if I understood your earlier

12

question correctly, you were suggesting that were these to

13

be viewed as criminal proceedings, deportation

14

proceedings, because they mete out consequences that may

15

be as harsh or harsher than many criminal sanctions.

16

seems to follow is that perhaps a person, an indigent

17

person, is entitled to appointed counsel under the Sixth

18

Amendment, although the Ardestani case doesn't

19

specifically require this Court to address that.

What

20

However, in looking at the statutory scheme and

21

in understanding what this statute means, it's helpful to

22

note that in the legislative history there was a change in

23

the Senate bill from "subject to," the language urged by

24

the Service, to "under Section 554," and the joint

25

explanatory statement of the conference committee, which

may be particularly probative because it represents the

2

views of both the House and Congress, stated that

3

adversary adjudications were those, and I quote, are

4

defined under the Administrative Procedures Act, where the

5

agency takes a position through representation by counsel.
But it's probably a lot more instructive for

6

7

this court to note that there were no discussions about

8

whether or not different agencies, different categories of

9

agencies were to be within the scope of EAJA.

Instead,

10

EAJA was a broad remedial statute, and the discussions

11

were about categories of proceedings, those that

12

were -- pardon me -- trial like, versus those that are

13

rule making or price fix -- rate fixing.

14

In addition to that, in order to get -- to

15

understand the meaning of the common preposition under, in

16

this particular instance, the EAJA, on its face,

17

recognizes the Administrative Conference of the United

18

States as an authority on the EAJA implementation.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Soloway.

MR. SOLOWAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
More important than the rejection of the Senate

We'll resume argument

language "subject to" that's been urged by the Government,

10

and perhaps more important that the joint explanatory

11

statement of the Conference Committee, that embraced the

12

very use of the term that we urge here, the EAJA

13

recognized the ACUS as an authority on the subject of the

14

EAJA, and there the chairman stated that questions of

15

EAJA's coverage should turn on substance.

16

The fact that a party has endured the burden and

17

expense of a formal hearing, rather than technicalities.

18

This is particularly important because that's precisely

19

what we're faced with here --a suggestion that a hyper-

20

technical interpretation of the word "under" to defeat the

21

reach of the EAJA statute to those particularly in need of

22

the statute is to be compared to the functional and more

23

appropriate interpretation as "as defined in" -- in other

24

words, just mere importation, a cross-reference of those

25

terms.

1

And for that reason, the burden should be on the

2

Government to show that the Congress intended not to have

3

merely a cross-reference to import those definitional

4

words, but the Government really should have the burden to

5

show that Congress intended to cover and protect people

6

from all sorts of agency adjudications, but not those

7

particularly in need of it in deportation proceedings.

There's no dispute that the EAJA statute applies

QUESTION:

itself that answers the question whether Social Security

hearings are covered.

Is that correct?

MR. SOLOWAY:

There's nothing in the statutory language

Except for the interpretation and

the same reasoning that's urged in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

10

In other words, if they are under the

11

APA or whatever it is, then you argue that by a parity of

12

reasoning, the deportation proceeding is also under?

13

MR. SOLOWAY:

Mr. Justice Stevens, that's

14

largely correct, but there's even more to the argument

15

than that.

16

Perales case, declined to decide the distinction whether

17

or not Social Security proceedings are technically

18

governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, or instead

19

by the more specialized version of the APA, namely the

20

Social Security Act.

In 1971, this case, in the Richardson v.

That arcane legal distinction has never been

21
22

resolved.

That debate has never been terminated.

Yet

23

Congress clearly wasn't interested in whether or not

24

Social Security proceedings were technically governed by

25

that statute.

Instead, they simply wished to categorize

Well, Justice White, the Marcello

existed 36 years ago between the Immigration Nationality

Act and the APA.

1

voluntarily the Government may be complying with it, but

2

the fact is that the requirement that Marcello addressed

3

does not exist.

4

then these things are not really under 554.

5

And if the requirement does not exist,

MR. SOLOWAY:

Justice Scalia, I respectfully

6

disagree with you.

If the analysis is going to look at

7

what takes place, what are the rights of people in

8

deportation proceedings, and are they different, can they

9

rely upon, are they in some functional and meaningful way

10

different than those hearings conducted under the

11

technical governance of the APA, the answer has to be no.

12

And the fact that the Marcello distinction has long since

13

evaporated is an important fact.

14

QUESTION:

How did the distinction -- what -- as

15

I remember, and I am very vague on it, but this

16

distinction only lasted for a couple of years, 1950 or

17

'52, when they allowed the INS Hearing Officer to have

18

investigative functions.

INS Hearing Officer's ability to have this dual function?

Is it statute or a practice?

It was not a statute, Your Honor.

5

MR. SOLOWAY:

Your Honor, if you're specifically

6

referring to the 1985 reenactment, which has been raised

7

by the Service in this case, it's important to note that

8

in 1984, before that reenactment, there were two circuit

9

court of opinion decisions that looked at the terms "under

10

Section 554" and interpreted those to be -- to mean simply

11

as defined in that section -- namely, requiring that a

The reason for

Statute must mandate that a hearing be required on the

would not place it within the ambit of the EAJA.

that if the statute on its face used the more restrictive

language than is even necessary, then, yes, it would be

chooses, although it is not obliged, to conduct that

So as far as statutory requirements are concerned, the
10

same discrepancies occur in the statutory obligations

11

between what the Immigration and Nationality Act provide

12

and what Section 554 provides.

13

And our position is that EAJA should not be

interpreted, and there is not indication that EAJA was

15

intended to deter agencies from voluntarily adopting

16

procedures that more closely conform to Section 554 of the

17

Administrative Procedure Act by imposing a cost on that

kind of agency procedural reform by making EAJA fees kick

in.

after discussing this problem of the possibility of

-- in the 1985 reenactment of

the reports to a procedure under the Social Security Act,

12

which was a pilot program that has now been entirely

13

discontinued as of 1987.

14

in a footnote in our brief in Sullivan against Hudson in

In the case we had last term,

different.

15

MR. WALLACE:

The question in

this case is only the question of the scope of the

authorization of the award of fees for administrative

adversary adjudications, defined as adjudications under

19

Section 554.

20

So we have explained in detail in footnote 12 of

21

our brief that throughout Section 504, the indisputable,

22

repeated usage of the word "under" in conjunction with

23

another section of the United States code, or another

Well, this Court has repeatedly

7

referred to it, and has referred to it approvingly in an

8

analogous contexts because ultimately it is a rule that

9

assures against intrusion by the courts into the

10

legislative function of determining what claims on the

11

public fisk should be honored and what claims should not.

12

Of course an argument can be made that this

13

would be a worthwhile use of public funds.

14

many requests for arguably worthwhile uses of public funds

15

and Congress has to determine how to apportion the limited

16

resources that are available.

17

decisions of last term that come to mind, the United

18

States against Dolm, and 0PM against Richmond, the Court

19

emphasized that this is the essence of the legislative

20

function under our constitutional system.

21

But there are

And in at least two

And in any event, it was the well-established

22

principal at the time Congress was drafting EAJA and that

23

established the rules of statutory draftsmanship under

24

which Congress put together this text, with its definition

would be available.
So that is the proper way to read the statutory

3

text, and it was equally well established at the time this

4

statute was drafted by this Court's 1955 decision in

5

Marcello against Bonds, that administrative deportation

proceedings are not proceedings governed by Section 554 of

7

the Administrative Procedure Act.

We have also collected in our brief, in footnote
26 on pages 28 and 29, some examples of the many

10

uncertainties that would be opened up if, instead of the

11

terms of the waiver of sovereign immunity, the Congress

12

used being the criterion, a more elastic criterion of

13

procedures functionally similar to Section 554 procedures

14

were to be adopted.

This would -I'm going to have to start reading

Well, we have not yet refrained

from writing footnotes, although I don't take issue with

those who have.

So that is

MR. WALLACE:

In any event - -

Thanks very much.

Some of the footnotes are also a

pleasure to read.

9

MR. WALLACE:

So, in essence, our position is

10

that the terms of EAJA's waiver of sovereign immunity

11

govern here.
It happens that there's also another barrier to

12

13

recovery in administrative deportation proceedings.

14

that is that a holding to that effect would require

15

construing EAJA to repeal by implication Section 1362 of

16

Title VIII.

17

difficulties that are encountered by straying beyond the

18

terms of the waiver of sovereign immunity that Congress

19

utilized.

And

This is to us illustrative of the

MR. SOLOWAY:

Thank you.

I respectfully

2

disagree with the interpretation of the ACUS exemption or

3

discussion about voluntary compliance.

4

Federal Register,

5

parties in disputes with the Federal Government are

6

entitled to hearings as a right, and others, for whatever

7

reasons, it has been determined that hearings may be

8

provided at the discretion of the Government.

9

I read from the

"Congress has provided that private

"On reflection we have concluded that it is more

10

consistent with the purposes of the legislation not to

11

cover proceedings of the latter type than to include them.

12

We have decided, therefore, to drop the provision of the

13

draft rules suggesting that awards be available when

14

agencies voluntarily comply with the procedures described

15

in Section 554."

16

That reference to voluntary acceptance of

17

procedures precisely deals with the requirement of

18

hearings being required to be on the record.

19

In addition to that, I wish to bring to this

20

Court's attention that there's been no suggestion of why
