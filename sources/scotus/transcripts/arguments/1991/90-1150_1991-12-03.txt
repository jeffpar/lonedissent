ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. MANESS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MR. MANESS:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The second section of article III of the

11

Constitution limits the judicial power of the United

12

States to nine carefully defined kinds of cases and

13

controversies and none others.

14

The question presented in this case is whether

15

the United States District Court violated that

16

constitutional limitation by awarding attorney's fees to

17

Coastal and the other defendants as a sanction from Mr.

18

Willy's asserted bad faith litigation, even though the

19

Federal court never possessed article III subject matter

20

jurisdiction over the controversy following the

21

defendant's wrongful removal of the case from a State

22

court, and even though Mr. Willy did not impede, obstruct,

23

or delay the Federal court's resolution of any

24

jurisdictional question, but instead correctly and

25

repeatedly, and eventually successfully, contested the

1

Federal court's unconstitutional exercise of the Federal

2

judicial power over the case.

3

We believe that this case is controlled by the

4

court's decision in United States Catholic Conference

5

against Abortion Rights Mobilization, Incorporated, that

6

the district court's sanction order violated article III,

7

and that that order and the judgment of the United States

8

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit mistakenly

9

affirming it are unconstitutional and therefore should be

10

reversed.
QUESTION:

11

Did you just refer, Mr. Maness, to

12

one of our cases in saying that it was controlled by that

entirely uncontradicted.

4

Coastal Corporation in Houston from 1981 until 1984 when

5

the company fired him.

6

Donald Willy worked as an

In 1985, represented by another Houston lawyer,

7

George Young, Mr. Willy filed a State court lawsuit

8

against Coastal and other defendants alleging a number of

9

exclusively State law causes of action.

The principal one

10

of these arose under a Texas supreme court decision,

11

Sabine Pilot Service Company against Hauck, which

12

recognizes a remedy in Texas for those whose employment is

13

wrongly terminated solely because of their refusal to

14

violate the law.

15

Mr. Young's petition on Mr. Willy's behalf

16

alleged that Coastal had fired him because of his refusal

17

to falsify environmental reports or to participate in the

18

company's ongoing violations of State and Federal

19

environmental laws at several of its facilities.

20

Coastal and the other defendants wrongly removed

21

the case to the United States District Court in Houston on

22

December 30, 1985, almost 6 years ago.

QUESTION:

24

MR. MANESS:

25

What was the basis for it?
I think, certainly the court of

appeals felt that there was more than an arguable basis

undertaken in good faith.

dispute that characterization.

4

QUESTION:

We don't, Justice White,

If there weren't any legitimate basis

5

for removal, do you suppose the Federal district court

6

would have the power to sanction the party removing the

7

case wrongfully?

MR. MANESS:

I think, Justice O'Connor, what is implicit in

No.

It would not.

this case and something I would like to touch on - QUESTION:

11

12

No.

Even under the court's inherent

authority?

13

MR. MANESS:

14

Our view is that the court's article III power

15

over a case or controversy isn't determined by how clear

16

or how difficult the jurisdictional question is.

17

is that the court either has the power to act under

18

article III of the Constitution or it does not.

19

does not have the power, then no complexity of the

20

jurisdictional issue or no good faith or, for that matter,

21

bad faith be it with the parties or the judge can affect

22

the outcome of the decision.

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Our view

And if it

Well, do you think that would be true

24

for criminal contempt sanctions for someone who wrongfully

25

removed the case, but then has an outburst in the

MR. MANESS:

No, I think our position

straightforwardly draws a distinction between criminal

MR. MANESS:

I think in those circumstances,

QUESTION:

Some kind of inherent power to

MR. MANESS:

I'm not sure, quite honestly, that

it should be characterized as an inherent power, given the

fact that since the Judiciary Act of 1789 there has always

been a statute that authorizes Federal courts to impose

2

criminal contempt sanctions-

3

Honor knows, is title XVIII, section 401.

4

The present statute, as Your

So it seems to me in the existing environment in

5

which we operate, it's more appropriate to say in the

6

event of such an outburst that the Federal court could

7

punish it under the criminal contempt power conferred by

8

article III, which Congress has implemented under

9

title XVIII, section 401.

10

QUESTION:

Why, why do you choose to read that

11

as applying to cases in which the court has jurisdiction

12

and does not have jurisdiction both, whereas the other

13

statutory authorities that exist you insist must be

14

interpreted to apply only to cases where the court has

15

jurisdiction?

16

that's the only reasonable way to read them.

I mean, they don't say that, but you say

17

MR. MANESS:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Why --

Yes.
Why is that reasonable for the civil,

but not for the criminal sanctions?
MR. MANESS:

I think, I think perhaps the best

21

way to answer that, if I can do it directly, is that

22

that's the distinction that the Mine Workers case brought.

23

The Mine Workers case holds that there is implicit in this

24

entire area a meaningful, principal distinction between

1

sanctions and equivalent efforts to vindicate, in that

2

instance, court orders, by civil contempt sanctions.
It seems to me that that's logical and makes a

great deal of sense when one undertakes to analyze what's

at stake here.

7

it by Congress in article III.
QUESTION:

What's at stake is the authority of the

Do you think criminal sanctions,

criminal contempt sanctions could have been imposed here

10

if the court, if the court regarded what was being done as

11

contemptuous, as an obstruction of its procedures?
MR. MANESS:

12

I think if the court had reached

13

that conclusion and it were supported by the evidence, and

14

of course, if Mr. Willy and Mr. Young had been accorded

15

the procedural protections that criminal contempt

16

implicates, yes, I think that would have been an instance

17

in which criminal contempt sanctions could have been

18

imposed.

19

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Maness, your opponent

20

cites the case of Chicot County Valley Drainage District,

21

the opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, in which this Court

22

held that even though a grant of Federal jurisdiction was

23

unconstitutional, nonetheless a lot of consequences flowed

24

from something having been acted on under that grant.

25

What's your -- how do you distinguish that case?

1

MR. MANESS:

I think that case and such cases as

2

Stoll against Gottlieb indicate clearly that

3

notwithstanding the fundamental importance of the

4

article III power, and the fact that a court in order to

5

act has to have that power under both article III and

6

ordinarily a statutory grant of jurisdiction from

7

Congress, but nonetheless, there are also countervailing

8

considerations that sometimes can override that.

9

And the example, of course, of res judicata,

10

collateral estoppel, similar sorts of administrative

11

devices that are simply more important constitutionally

12

than allowing, for example, absence of subject matter

13

jurisdiction to be raised long after the judgment is

14

entered and long after the case has otherwise been closed.

15

QUESTION:

So it isn't just a totally clear line

16

between black and white.

17

of for what the claim is.

18

MR. MANESS:

There has to be some evaluation

I think so.

But I'm troubled if

19

the Court were to extend that principle to going back to

20

what I think was soundly repudiated in Catholic

21

Conference.

22

called colorable jurisdiction.

23

And that's the idea that there's something

I was perviewing the transcript of the argument

24

in Catholic Conference yesterday,

25

coming up that the Court was interested in knowing what is

colorable jurisdiction.

question.

6

And counsel for the parties were

Then the question was asked, what

And I think there was still some

I think the Court in Catholic Conference

7

decisively and soundly repudiated the idea that because a

8

Federal court looks like it has the constitutional power

9

to act, that that's the functional equivalent of its

10
11

having the constitutional power to act.
I think we've also pointed out in our brief that

12

there's an observation in Szabo Food, which was quoted in

13

Cooter & Gell, a very important case that I would like to

14

turn to in a moment, Judge Easterbrook suggested that if a

15

district court elects to proceed forward with the case and

16

to supervise discovery under rule 16 and to conduct a

17

trial and to enter a judgment, and then discovers at the

18

end that the court doesn't have article III subject matter

19

jurisdiction, it can nonetheless treat any derelictions by

20

counsel of the parties that occurs during that period as

21

appropriately sanctionable, either under rule 11 or under

22

an inherent power.

23

But we think that's flatly mistaken.

I had

thought since Capron against Van Noorden that

jurisdictional issues have to be decided at the first of

2

since Turner against the President and Directors of the

3

Bank of North America, a case decided by this Court in

4

1799, that if it's a tossup, if the judge says to herself,

5

gee, I don't know whether I have jurisdiction or not, it's

6

equally balanced, the presumption is the court doesn't

7

have jurisdiction unless promptly dismissed or remand the

case.

And I had thought that at least

We've also pointed to some 12 decisions -QUESTION:

What if the, what if the case goes up

11

to the appellate court, there's never been any

12

jurisdictional question raised, but the appellate, the

13

court of appeals, like it should, raises a jurisdictional

issue and says there's no, never has been any jurisdiction

17

I suppose that you would take the

MR. MANESS:

Absolutely.

I want to make it

18

plain, Justice White, that, the fact that Mr. Willy and

19

his counsel raised the absence of constitutional power

20

from the get-go is just icing on the cake for us.

21

result would be exactly the same even if they had never

22

raised it, even if it had never been raised in the court

of appeals, even if it had not even been raised in the

it's an answer to your question is, where do you find that

Why don't we have a Federal Criminal Rule 11(a) that

authorizes the imposition of something equivalent to or

functionally equivalent to criminal contempt penalties via

We've also pointed out in our brief that apart

8

from the fact that Mr. Willy and Mr. Young weren't

9

accorded any of the procedural protections that a criminal

10

prosecution for criminal contempt would entail, if these

11

sanctions are like criminal contempt, then Coastal's

under Young against Vuitton can't prosecute a criminal

Don't you have to take it, then, a

to protect the other party.

that we accept the court's authority to impose criminal

And by the same reasoning

contempt sanctions for the purpose of protecting the

12

extend to allowing these civil sanctions whether it be

under rule 11 or inherent power to protect the other

parties once they are accepted by the court as being

before them?

I think, Justice Souter, that that,

that that argument and that reasoning could, in fact, be

Certainly.
And why doesn't the same protective

reason argue just as persuasively here?
MR. MANESS:

Well, Justice Souter, if the Court

were to accept that reason, it would essentially be saying

that even in the absence of article III subject matter

mistakenly undertakes to hear and decide a case over which

it lacks the judicial power nonetheless has a form of

judicial power.

QUESTION:

And isn't, isn't, isn't one rationale

for that that although the court may lack article III

court has an article III obligation to the parties before

Yes, absolutely, under Insurance

QUESTION:

Well, what if, what if the reason,

what if the reason you don't have personal jurisdiction is

because the Constitution forbids it?

12

MR. MANESS:

I think that then would presumably

implicate article III subject matter jurisdiction and

would be in our case then.

15

QUESTION:

So if some court is wrong in thinking

it has long-arm jurisdiction and wrong because the

MR. MANESS:

I don't think so, because the

And as

a result what happens is once we begin to say that there

is inherent power both to determine jurisdiction and

inherent power that exists within the court to police its

own proceedings, then there must be the ability to

21

sanction someone who does the kind of activity which is at

stake in this particular case.

23

Really, as a constitutional matter, the only

thing that petitioner can raise is the fact that somehow

And yet that

1

argument has been rejected.

2

attorney's fees certainly can be imposed either under

rule 11 or under the court's inherent power.

4

QUESTION:

The Court has held that

Well, our, our cases in Chambers

5

against NASCO and Hutto against Finney suggests that fee

6

shifting sanctions are analogous to civil contempt.

7

perhaps that answers the question.

8

9
10
11

MR. BEATTY:

And

If I might, Your Honor, address

both that issue of Hutto v. Finney as well as the issue of
attorney fee shifting.
It was pointed out both in the majority by

12

Justice White that the reason that fee shifting is of

13

concern is because of concern for the American rule.

14

I submit that that is not a constitutional impediment,

15

that is, a court could take, act further.

16

just elected to stop short of that and say, on fee

17

shifting we're going to honor what we believe, what

18

Justice Scalia referred to in his dissent as deeply rooted

19

history and congressional policy.

20

there's a slight rub, but it's not a constitutional rub at

21

the attorney's fee level.

22

Now

The Court has

And so for that reason,

And then with regard to Hutto v. Finney, if you

23

look at that, recall that that case was the prison case

24

dealing with a situation in Arkansas in which Arkansas had

25

repeatedly been told, please take action.

It was more

1

than an exhortation of please, it was a take action.

2

that that had not been done in order to clarify, in order

3

to remedy the problems in their prison system.

4

therefore, the Court imposed a $20,000 attorney's fee

5

sanctions, but said in that case we hope that will incline

them to behave in the future and hope that they - - and

that was civil contempt.

MR. BEATTY:

QUESTION:

No.

I cannot cite you --

But in Hutto against Finney, I may be

3

fuzzy about it, but that was really a statutory case.

4

That was enforcement of the civil rights attorney's fee

5

award action.

6

MR. BEATTY:

Yes, but the argument that was

7

raised was a rule 11 case because it was, Arkansas was

8

arguing that there couldn't be an imposition of attorney's

9

fees against them because it would interfere with their

position -QUESTION:

11

But

that wasn't the sole grounds for rejecting that.

14

The Eleventh Amendment, yes.

MR. BEATTY:

I apologize.

That's the reason

this case is here.

15

But once you say that the court has this

16

inherent power to govern proceedings -- let me, for

17

example, turn to jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction.

18

If what happens is, let's assume just by way of assumption

19

that what happens is that you have an environmental case

in which a standing issue is raised regarding someone in

could be litigated a significant way down the road without

having a jurisdictional determination made.

It may well happen that

circumstances change such that all of a sudden the court

is divested of jurisdiction.

And what the argument of petitioner seems to

suggest is that during that entire preceding period there

would be no opportunity to impose rule 11 sanctions on a

MR. BEATTY:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I - And the question is really that,

22

whether it isn't enough to protect the court's integrity

against these assaults to have the criminal sanctions

available, which you call, you call the rule 11 lesser

25

sanctions, but in one respect they're greater.

You don't

1

have the kind of safeguard, the kind of protections that I

2

think the contumacy can be less probably under rule 11

3

than is needed for criminal sanctions.

4

MR. BEATTY:

The importance of the case I don't

5

underestimate.

6

that the 1983 amendment indicated that what happened was

7

that they needed to change the sanctions in order, for

8

example, to establish an objective test as opposed to a

9

subjective test.

10

However, it's important to note, remember

The advisor said, we need to be able to

get at this conduct.
I come to you as a person who practices

11
12

primarily in front of the district courts.

We all know

13

the problems that are existing down there.

I would

14

suggest that even though we may have gotten along well for

15

200 years, primarily we've gotten along well for 200 years

16

because people have obeyed the rules and do believe that

17

rule 11 would apply.

18

lower courts have always suggested is that the rules would

apply.

That's what the majority of the

language of the rule, and no one questions that it applies

couple of cases come up like this.

would be that there is, that there is the equivalent of a

litigant and he may well lose his case on the merits as a

result of the impact of the Federal rule.

Here there has been no impact whatsoever.

And

again, that would point out the point that, what I think

is a very important issue which is it would seem that

either from the standpoint of separation of powers or from

8

the standpoint of Federalism, that there's not a competing

interest on the other side.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that argument about, you

wouldn't that have, again, produced a different result in

distinguishing factor that you already made, which is that

that was a civil contempt case by a nonparty who all of a

sudden, who had that right, that immediate right of an

that one ultimately has to come out with, yes, there is

inherent power, yes, that inherent power may well be

shaped, not only by Congress, but the inherent power is

reserved to the courts and the Court could use that since

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

1

MR. MANESS:

2

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court stated

3

in Catholic Conference that a court, Federal district

4

court's subpoena power under Federal Civil Rule 45 cannot

5

be greater than its article III subject matter

6

jurisdiction.

7

I suggest exactly the same principle compels the

8

holding that a court's sanction power under rule 11 cannot

9

be greater than its article III subject matter

10

jurisdiction.

I would have thought at least since Sibbach

11

against Wilson & Co. and in light of the express

12

provisions of Federal Rule 82, that this isn't a rule 11

13

case because rule 11 can't enlarge the jurisdiction of the

14

Federal district court.

15

jurisdiction in a most fundamental sense, the power of a

16

court to do something.

And we're talking here about

17

Another distinction, and I think it's crucial in

18

light of the discussions we've had this morning is that in

19

Catholic Conference the civil contempt sanctions were

20

imposed against a nonparty and therefore were immediately

21

appealable.

22

the fly paper.

23

not granted Coastal's motion to dismiss, we might have

24

been in the Federal district court much longer than we

25

were.

In this case, by contrast, we were stuck to
And conceivably, if the district court had

Finally, I would like to leave the Court with
this hypothetical.

What makes Coastal's argument somewhat

compelling is the assumption, and I think it's an
appropriate assumption, that the district court acted in
good faith.

But suppose the district court acted in bad

faith, suppose from the beginning it said, look, I realize
I don't have article III subject matter jurisdiction, but
I've got to decide this case anyway since it's very
important question of State law.

And if I leave it to the

State courts, they're probably going to botch it.
Is it conceivably arguable then if the district
court proceeds to hear and preside the case over a period
of years that the court could then attempt to award
attorney's fees to the party wrongly moving the case?

And

if the Court is going to draw a distinction between good
faith exercises of colorable article III power and bad
faith exercises, then it's right back where it was at
Catholic Conference.

And seven members of the Court,

seven members of the present Court, rejected that argument
fairly conclusively and fairly persuasively.
We think the Federal judicial power under
article III doesn't depend on subjective mental processes
of judges or litigants.
