MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:

16

was still pending on rehearing.

it was made

This

explicitly applicable to any case pending before, during,
or after enactment of the act.
Twenty years ago Amtrak inaugurated its
Montrealer service between Washington's Union Station and
Montreal.

The train traveled through Vermont and New

Hampshire over the Connecticut River Line, a line owned
over some portions by the Boston and Maine and over other
portions by the Central Vermont.
Things ran smoothly until the mid-1980's, when
Guilford Transportation acquired both Boston and Maine and
the Delaware and Hudson Railway.

Now, the Delaware and

Hudson owned a north-south line of track parallel to the
Conn River Line west of Lake Champlain in New York State.
As a result, the Conn River Line diminished in importance
to Boston and Maine and to its parent Guilford, to the
point that in 1987 Boston and Maine listed its portion of
the Conn River Line as track it anticipated abandoning.
Conditions on the line deteriorated, the Montrealer slowed
to a crawl over the Boston and Maine segment, and in 1987
Amtrak cancelled Montrealer service.
To restore that service, Amtrak determined that
it needed to rehabilitate the Conn River Line, and
Congress appropriated money for the purpose.

Amtrak was

unable to agree with Boston and Maine on terms under which
it felt it could responsibly invest the necessary funds,

and it turned to the Interstate Commerce Commission for

2

relief.

3

It sought two things from the Commission:

4

first, an order authorizing it to condemn the Boston and

5

Maine segment for just compensation, and second an order

6

authorizing it to then reconvey the line to the Central

7

Vermont, which had agreed to pay for the line, to

8

rehabilitate it in part with funds provided by Amtrak, to

9

maintain it in a condition suitable for Amtrak's passenger

10

service for 20 years, to grant Amtrak trackage rights for

11

that period, and also to grant the Boston and Maine

12

trackage rights so that it could serve its existing

13

customers on the line.

14

Both steps in this transaction -- the

15

condemnation and the reconveyance - - required ICC

16

approval.

17

under section 402(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act.

18

That statute specifies that if Amtrak and the railroad are

19

unable to agree on the sale of property owned by the

20

railroad and required for inter-city rail passenger

21

service, that Amtrak may seek an order establishing its

22

need for the property and requiring its conveyance on

23

reasonable terms and conditions, including just

24

compensation.

Amtrak sought approval for the condemnation

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

It's a fee or nothing?
The ICC reads that language --

20

required for inter-city rail passenger service -- to mean

21

simply that the property that's involved must be put to

22

use by Amtrak in providing that service, as opposed to

23

being used for something else.

QUESTION:

This is a familiar usage of

But who decides whether an easement

4

will suffice as opposed to taking the fee interest in the

5

property?
MR. ROBERTS:

6

Amtrak decides in the first

7

instance whether it will put this property to use in

8

providing inter-city rail passenger service, and if that

9

is in fact what the property is to be used for, that

10

statutory mandate is satisfied.

11

make sure that it's being used for inter-city rail

12

passenger service, and then that is sufficient.

13

in the statute suggests that the ICC is to engage in a

14

process of tearing down the property interest to the least

15

restrictive alternative, and in fact the amendment, of

16

course, makes clear that that is not the case.

17

QUESTION:

The Commission looks to

Nothing

Is there any contention that the

18

review that is required of the FCC was not undertaken in

19

this case, as you define it?
MR. ROBERTS:

20

As I define it, I don't believe

21

so.

It is true that there is not a precise finding that

22

this requirement was met, but there's certainly a precise

23

finding in the opinion of the Commission that the Boston

24

and Maine interpretation of the provision is not the

25

correct one.

There is also certainly findings that the

reason Amtrak is proceeding is to restore the Montrealer

2

service to put this line of track to use in providing

3

inter-city rail passenger service, and that is a

4

sufficient finding on the record.

5

What the amendment said in 1990 was that Amtrak

11

Amtrak -- if Amtrak intended to reconvey property, it

12

couldn't condemn it.

the case that the reconveyance dooms the condemnation in

you can explain the amendment.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, if it's a dead stand-off

then the Commission under Chevron is entitled to deference
in its construction.
QUESTION:

Not on the basis of the amendment.

MR. ROBERTS:

What the amendment said - - what

the court of appeals -- the amendment needs to be
understood in light of the court of appeals' decision.
The court of appeals said you can't condemn property that
you're going to reconvey because the reconveyance proves
you didn't require it.

What the amendment says is, you

may condemn - - you may reconvey property that you have
condemned.
QUESTION:

The amendment has to be understood

primarily on the basis of its language, and nothing in its
language whatever goes to the word required, which was the
basis for the court of appeals' decision.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, with respect, I disagree.

The language of the amendment makes clear that it is not
an answer to the Commission's order to say that you
reconveyed that, therefore the condemnation was no good in
the beginning, because the amendment makes clear that
Amtrak may reconvey property it has condemned.

If it may

the first place.
QUESTION:

2

Reconveyance is only one manner of

3

proving that you don't need the property.

4

at issue, the principle that underlay the court of

5

appeals' decision, was that Amtrak did not need the

6

property.

7

have to show a requirement for the property.

8

9

The principle

Nothing in the amendment goes to whether you

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, what the court of appeals

said is we can tell that Amtrak did not need the property

10

because it reconveyed it, and the amendment at least

11

undermines that holding of the court of appeals.

12

- - going back - -

13

QUESTION:

Now, the

So then we'd have to remand to the

14

court of appeals to say, you should not consider the

15

reconveyance automatically to show that they didn't need

16

the property, but you can still consider whether they

17

needed the property or not.

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Well, then let me turn to the --

You don't want to waste all that

time, do you?

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think a remand's necessary

for that purpose, because under Chevron the decision was

wrong even before the amendment.

QUESTION:

Same way Thomas Jefferson read the

necessary and proper clause.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, and quite different from the

8

way Chief Justice Marshall read it in McCullough against

9

Maryland.

It's a familiar usage of the word in the law.

10

Necessary is a synonym for required.

11

Marshall told us it means convenient or useful.

12

cited in our opening brief the dictionary definition that

13

require means to call for as suitable or appropriate in a

particular case, as in it's cold outside.

The error in the court of appeals' reading of

20

required for inter-city rail passenger service I think is

21

clearest if you look at section 402(d) as a whole.

22

and Maine and the court of appeals say that the purpose of

23

this provision, required for inter-city rail passenger

24

service, is to make sure that Amtrak really needs what

it's taking, but that's exactly what the next sentence of

QUESTION:

The

What section are you reading now,

Mr. Roberts?
MR. ROBERTS:

I'm referring to section 402(d),

6

which is set forth in the appendix to our brief, page la.

7

The first sentence contains this required for inter-city

8

rail passenger service language, but the next sentence in

9

the statute goes on to say that Amtrak's need for the

10

property shall be deemed to be established unless the

11

Commission makes two contrary findings.

12

In other words, the question of whether Amtrak

13

really needs this property as opposed to some other

14

property is addressed in the second sentence, the one that

15

begins, unless the Commission finds.

case, the court of appeals should have deferred to the
Commission's reasonable interpretation, an interpretation
manifested in the upholding of this transaction.
The court of appeals also cited the structure of
section 402 in reaching its conclusion.

It noted that

section 402(a) of the act provides the right of Amtrak to
seek trackage rights, it surmised that that was all that
Amtrak needed in this case, and therefore it concluded
that Amtrak had to proceed under that provision and not
under section 402(d).
Again, the ICC, the agency entrusted with
administration of this statute, read the statute
differently.

It determined that Amtrak had an election of

MR. ROBERTS:

precise prerequisites that Amtrak must meet before
invoking condemnation authority.

An exhaustion of 402(a)

or any of the other provisions in section 402 is not
listed among the prerequisites.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, I - - of course required

can be read the way the Commission wanted to, in
isolation, but isn't it unreasonable to read it that way
when, if you do not read it to impose a requirement of
necessity in the narrow sense, the only thing Amtrak has
to do in order to condemn property is to show either - either -- that taking it away will not impair the ability
of the railroad it's taking it from to function, or that
it can't do without the property itself.
MR. ROBERTS:

Congress determined that Amtrak

was entitled to those powers on that basis.

It set forth

a very explicit presumption in the statute.

It addressed

that question when it determined to give Amtrak eminent
domain power, and it said that Amtrak's need for the
property shall be deemed to be established unless both of
the contrary findings that you mentioned are made.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This is a case about a condemnation statute
which allows the taking of private property.

Simply

10

stated, our position is that section 402(d), the statute

11

that's implicated directly in this case, cannot be used by

12

Amtrak to condemn more property than is required for

13

inter-city rail passenger service.

14

In this case, the Commission failed to make a

15

relevant inquiry into what property was required for

16

inter-city rail passenger service.

17

that whatever Amtrak wanted it was entitled to take and

18

proceeded with a case in which it ultimately approved the

conveyance.

of the statute.

21

It erroneously assumed

In our view, that's an erroneous construction

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Goldbloom, is it not

22

correct that the statute says that unless the Commission

23

finds (a) and (b) under section 1, then the need of the

24

corporation for the property shall be deemed to be

25

established?

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

1

Yes, Chief Justice, it does say

2

that, but that is a second level of inquiry that the

3

Commission must make.

4

the statute appears right out in the first sentence of the

5

statute, and in this particular statute we have a series

6

of limitations written into the statute which provide in

7

the first instance that the parties are unable to agree.

8

There is a definition in the statute that the property

that is - - that is being sought is required for inter­

limitation because there's a description of the term

14

QUESTION:

And there's a third

So you say the term need of the

15

corporation as used after subsections (a) and (b) does not

16

include the requirement for inter-state -- inter-city rail

17

service and it doesn't suffice to dispense with the

18

negotiation requirement?

19

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

20

Yes, Chief Justice, that is our

answer, and let me amplify, if I may, on.that.

21

When Congress enacted this particular section in

22

1973 they also enacted a similar provision, section 305(d)

23

of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which provides Amtrak

24

with the authority to condemn nonrailroad-owned

25

property -- that is, property that might be owned by any

other private party.

2

similar language in it, which says that the property,

3

again, must be required for inter-city rail passenger

4

service.

5

And that statutory provision has a

Now, the reason why the requirement for inter­

6

city rail passenger service has to be met in the first

7

instance is that the second level of determination of need

8

applies only if it will substantially impair the

9

obligations of the -- of the railroad to function as a

10

common carrier.
Now, let us assume as a hypothetical that

11
12

Conrail owes - - owns a building over here on Pennsylvania

Avenue.

Amtrak for whatever purposes if it can be shown that the

15

taking of the building doesn't impair Conrail's ability to

16

act as a common carrier.

17

first level of limitation that is required for inter-city

18

rail passenger service, you never get to the consideration

19

of why they're taking the property in the first instance,

20

and this is consistent with the nature of this very type

21

of statute.

8

I think the word required has a

Let me deal with the Government's argument
first.

They say required means useful, appropriate;

10

Amtrak, the petitioner, says in connection with, but the

11

statute has a language - - Congress used a very stringent

12

verb in connection with this particular statute, and that

13

verb required informs a court, or the Commission, how

14

Amtrak intends to be using the property that it intends to

15

take.

16

Now, it is not a question that it is absolutely

17

essential or indispensable.

18

in the context of this statute, where Congress speaks in

1

terms of property, including interests in property, there

20

is a whole history of statutory construction of the

21

concept of eminent domain in private hands, that the least

22

interest that is intrusive should be taken in the

circumstances of an eminent domain statute.

Is

the gist of your argument that the fee interest wasn't

required since a leasehold or an easement was sufficient,

And

11

to take that a step further, when the Commission is

12

confronted with an application under section 402(d) it

13

should look to see what is it that Amtrak requires, and if

they can determine that Amtrak requires something less

than a fee, then that is what Amtrak should be entitled to

get.

QUESTION:

When, for the -- can you give me an

5

example of a case in which they would need to take the fee

6

in trackage release?

7

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

I cannot -- there is a

8

suggestion in the concurring opinion by Judge Ginsburg in

9

the court below that in a circumstance where Amtrak was

10

dealing with another railroad and where, under the facts

11

in that particular hypothetical, Amtrak was unable to get

12

the type of trackage rights interest or the cooperation of

13

the other railroad in running its trains over those

14

tracks, in those circumstances, Judge Ginsburg suggests

15

that perhaps 402(a) could be used to obtain trackage

16

rights.

17

But then she goes on to say, this case doesn't

18

establish that, and on the facts in this case it is clear

19

that something less than the fee would be what Amtrak

20

should be entitled to get.

21

section 402(a) has a provision for granting trackage

22

rights to Amtrak when they are unable to agree with a

23

railroad over the use of the tracks, and in those

circumstances the Commission has the authority to impose a

services and facilities.

3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Goldbloom,

I thought the

4

problem here was that the Amtrak could get a trackage

5

right but it needed a trackage right over a rail line that

6

was maintained adequately to enable it to run its

7

passenger trains at the appropriate speed, and that what

8

it would get here with a trackage right was simply a right

9

to run its railroads over very poorly maintained rails at

10

speeds that wouldn't meet its need.

11

something that was going to be maintained at a higher

12

level than B&M would maintain it, and Boston and Maine had

13

made a determination that for its purposes it didn't need

14

to maintain the tracks at this higher level degree of

maintenance.

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

19

could require Boston and Maine to upgrade the tracks and

20

to maintain them, and in so doing it would look to the

21

provisions that Congress imposed in 402(a), which requires

22

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

And the

Why don't you place

Well, I do place stress on it,

property is a congressional recognition that something

less than the fee might be called for when Amtrak seeks to

QUESTION:

So the required modifies the interest

by the corporation -- not necessary to the corporation,

but used, and you're saying it's not being used here, the

18

fee.

19

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

It's not being used because, as

20

the court of appeals found and as there is no dispute in

21

this case, Amtrak did not want to own the property, did

22

not need to own the property, and had no interest in

23

owning it, ever, and so if it was capable of being

24

satisfied by an interest in property less than the fee,

25

then the fee by definition could not be required.

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but that -- you're making two

2

different arguments, one, you're arguing they should have

3

proceeded under 402(a) to require trackage rights.

4

you're saying they should have proceeded under 402(d)(1)

5

to condemn trackage rights?
MR. GOLDBLOOM:

6

Now

What I'm saying, Justice

7

Stevens, is that when the Commission is confronted with an

8

application under 402(d) it should examine to see what it

9

is that Amtrak is required -- Amtrak requires.

If it

10

looks at what Amtrak requires and sees that what it really

11

needs is a trackage rights agreement with imposition of

12

conditions and maintenance requirements, then it should

13

say to Amtrak your proper relief and remedy is a petition

14

under 402(a).

15

That's what you should do.

If, on the other hand, it determines that a

16

trackage rights agreement will not suffice, but something

17

more, let's say -- and it's been suggested in this record

18

by one of the vice chairmen of the Commission -- that

19

perhaps an easement to go onto the tracks and to perform

20

maintenance services of that character, then perhaps

21

trackage rights agreements and an easement might be

22

sufficient to fulfill Amtrak's requirements.
QUESTION:

23

Do you think you could logically make

24

the same argument in the face of the statute as now

25

amended?

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. GOLDBLOOM:

4

Yes, Justice Stevens --

You do.
-- because we don't believe the

statute as amended affects the result in this case.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the statute as amended assumes

6

that there would be situations in which the condemnation

7

would require a greater property interest than the

8

Commission absolutely needs because it can reconvey the

9

property and obviously take back something less than the

10

fee.
MR. GOLDBLOOM:

11

That may very well be, and we've

12

suggested that there might be circumstances where it might

13

be necessary under -- under the facts of a particular case

14

to take a larger interest than Amtrak actually needs, such

15

as a - - take a large building and to raze it and put up a

16

small structure.

17

But in this particular case, the court of

18

appeals had more than one finding.

19

there is a conclusion or a holding in the court of appeals

20

that says that Amtrak may not take property that it does

21

not itself intend to own, and as to that holding, the

22

court of appeals -- the court of appeals' decision has

23

been overruled by the 1990 amendment.

24
25

There is a finding --

The court of appeals went on and had other
holdings.

It said that when the Commission is faced with

a 402(d) application it must make a determination as to

2

what is required for inter-city rail passenger service.

3

It found -- and this is a unanimous ruling by the court of

4

appeals because Judge Ginsburg also agreed with this --

5

that the Commission had not made that determination --

6

what is required.

7

they admit, or concede that the Commission did not make a

8

determination as to what is required.

9

kind of an abstract, perhaps, decision was made.

And as I read the Government's brief,

They say that some

The fact of the matter is that it came up this

10
11

way.

12

right after Amtrak filed its petition, Boston and Maine

13

came in with a petition to convert the 402(d) proceeding

14

to a 402(a) proceeding, and it said to the Commission this

15

is really a dispute between us over the upgrading and the

16

maintenance of these tracks, and we're having a fight over

17

who is supposed to pay for this, and we think that Amtrak

18

should pay for it because after all it's one train that

19

goes back and forth once a day and it's going to cost

20

$400,000 a year or so, and it should be Amtrak's

21

responsibility.

23

is to pay for the upgrading and maintenance of this

It has

They're entitled to a conveyance if they have -- if

Now, they did so without an evidentiary

11

proceeding, and they were applying, in a sense, the same

12

statutory phrase that any Federal district judge would

13

have to apply faced with an attempted taking by Amtrak of

14

nonrailroad property, and they did it almost -- to draw an

15

analogy, if there was a complaint and an answer and a

16

district judge looked at the complaint and answer and made

17

a determination without doing anything further.

18

this case the Commission did not make a finding under the

19

required phrase of the statute.

20

Now, the court of appeals said that.

And in

They also

21

said that the Commission's ruling did violence to the

22

provisions of 402(a), because they overlooked the

23

requirements of 402(a) that require Amtrak to pay the

24

incremental costs of rail passenger service, and by

25

allowing Amtrak to evade those requirements the Commission

14

Now, the Government makes a further argument.

8

They say that Chevron controls the determination of the

9

Commission, but for a number of reasons Chevron is not

10

applicable.

12

ambiguous.

Chevron applies where you have to grope and

13

figure out what the statute really means.

Certainly the Chevron decision wouldn't apply to

20

the rulings of 600 or so Federal district judges.

But

there are limitations in this statute, and we don't

believe that the Chevron case applies where there are

limitations.

2

can't see how Chevron would be applicable.
And thirdly we don't believe it's a permissible

3

construction of the statute because, as I've indicated,

4

there are circumstances where, using the Commission's

5

construction, Amtrak could take an office building, a

6

property of -- that is owned by another railroad, without

7

ever showing that that property is required for inter­

8

city rail passenger service, and the only mean -- the only

9

restriction would be whether the taking of that property

10

impaired the functions of the condemnee's ability to

11

perform as a common carrier.

12

And finally, we don't think that Chevron applies

13

because there just simply is a nonfinding here.

Commission did not make a finding, as we read the

appears as -- in the opening sentence of section 402(d).

It says:

And a third limitation, although it's not

20

written in as a finding but it's certainly clearly

recognition by Congress that perhaps in these

circumstances something less than the fee would suffice.

Well, if they're properly

we would urge this court to affirm, the Commission should

look to see what it is that Amtrak requires, and if Amtrak

got after the conveyance to Central Vermont, then that's

12

what the Commission should impose upon Boston and Maine.

can the ICC look at the cost to Amtrak as part of that

to Amtrak of maintaining the track would be less under

this arrangement.

That's the way you satisfy that.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

Well, we don't have to go that

2

far.

It's satisfied because this property is used in

3

providing inter-city rail passenger service.

4

Montrealer runs over what used to be the Boston and Maine

5

line.
QUESTION:

6

All right.

The

Well, again, I guess your

7

argument again assumes that you have an absolute election

8

as to whether to proceed under subsection (a) or

9

subsection (d).

If you don't make that assumption, then

10

your first-tier analysis of what is required depends upon

11

assuming that a lower maintenance cost is sufficient to

12

satisfy the standard requirement.

13

MR. ROBERTS:

That may well be, but I'll

14

reiterate what I said earlier, that there's nothing in

15

section 402(d) or (a) that imposes such an exhaustion

16

requirement.

17

QUESTION:

Well, but if the question is need,

18

why did Amtrak need the fee when in the long run it gave

19

it back to somebody?
MR. ROBERTS:

20

It needed the fee in part to be

21

able to convey it to a railroad that would maintain the

22

line.

23

QUESTION:

I know.

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

QUESTION:

I know - -

Boston and Maine --

But they didn't need to own the fee

MR. ROBERTS:

they wouldn't have been able to engage in the transaction.

5

Well, if they didn't have the fee

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't they -- why did they

have to take the fee away from the Boston and Maine?
MR. ROBERTS:

6

Because the Boston and Maine, as

7

it itself emphasized, had no incentive to maintain these

8

tracks in a condition suitable for Amtrak service.

their basic point.

10

That's

We don't -- 17 miles an hour is fine

for our trains.
QUESTION:

11

Well, the court of appeals said we

12

don't make these determinations on this record.

13

-- ICC should have done it's work, and we think counsel is

14

very persuasive.

the authority to present this kind of an issue to us.

The court

The only thing is, counsel hasn't got

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the court of appeals could

17

only have reasoned that if it were imposing a requirement

18

that you will not find in section 402(d).

That's not something set forth in the

QUESTION:

You say, need is presumed.

MR. ROBERTS:

25

what the statute says.

Need is presumed.
