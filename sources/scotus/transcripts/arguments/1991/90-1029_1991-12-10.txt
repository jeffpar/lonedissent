ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONN P. PICKETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. PICKETT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the.Court:
Kodak's lack of market power is central to the

11
12

resolution of this case.

13

interbrand equipment competition disciplines Kodak's

14

conduct in the derivative after-markets for parts and

15

service.

16

claims fail, and Kodak has no duty to sell them parts.

17

Kodak's copiers and micrographics equipment,

Kodak lacks market power because

Without evidence of market power, respondent's

18

like most durable goods, require regular service and

19

maintenance.

20

through an in-house service organization, subject to

21

uniform training, practices, and procedures.

22

Kodak chose to provide this service itself,

Kodak did not have to choose this course.

24

manufacturers do.

2

highest-quality service available in the industry.

And to

Kodak saw the rise of independent service

organizations as a threat to its interbrand equipment

marketing strategy and to the investments which had been

made to support it.

So when ISO's demanded that Kodak

11

provide service in competition with Kodak, Kodak said no.

12

It said what any competitor, in a competitive market,

13

ought to be able to say to another competitor.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Pickett, may I ask a question?

15

I'm unclear about these things that the

16

respondents wanted to buy from Kodak.

17

manufactured by Kodak, or does Kodak, in turn, buy these

18

things from other suppliers?

19

MR. PICKETT:

Are they things

In the great majority of

20

instances, they are things that are manufactured by Kodak.

21

In some small percentage of times, there are other

22

equipment manufacturers who will manufacture a part for

23

Kodak to be used in a copier, or in a component of a

24

micrographics system.

25

QUESTION:

So the only source of supply would

1

have to be from Kodak, if the respondents were to buy

2

these parts?

3

MR. PICKETT:

Well, unless they made them

4

themselves, or unless they disassembled used equipment, or

5

unless they sought other sources.

6

But the lack of market power that Kodak has,

7

does not come from the source -- availability of sources

8

to ISO's; it comes from the interbrand competition and the

9

effects.

10

Also, Kodak --

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Pickett, I had thought when we

12

took this case, that the absence of market power in the

13

equipment market was a given.

MR. PICKETT:

But apparently it's not.

It is a given, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

Am I mistaken that it's challenged in

the briefs here?
MR. PICKETT:

19

It is for the very first time in

20

the briefs on the merit.

21

the district court, which, of course, controls the

22

resolution in this case, was only evidence put in by

23

Kodak.

MR. PICKETT:

No, none whatsoever in the

question presented in the petition is does a vertically

the order of 75 percent by Kodak.

2

Kodak said to these ISO's --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. PICKETT:

5

Was that in the record?
That is in the record in the

declarations provided by Kodak in the summary judgment.

6

Kodak said to the ISO's what any competitor

7

ought to be able to say:

8

yourself.

9

same investments and taking the same risks as we have.

10

This Court has previously recognized, in GTE

we will not help you, help

Compete with us if you will, but by making the

11

Sylvania, and again in Sharp Electronics, that interbrand

12

competition is at the core of vertical restraints

13

analysis.

14

of the antitrust laws and provides a significant check on

15

intrabrand competition.

16

Interbrand competition is the primary concern

Interbrand competition also governs the analysis

17

of this case.

18

judgment was its evidence that Kodak faced robust

19

interbrand competition in the markets for copiers and

20

micrographics equipment, from the likes of Xerox, 3M, Bell

21

& Howell, Canon, Minolta, Fuji, and a host of other

22

Japanese manufacturers.

23
24
25

The core of Kodak's motion for summary

Kodak must conform its conduct to the demands of
that robust, interbrand competition.

a narrative account of things.

And yet this did come up

2

on a motion for summary judgment, where all disputed facts

3

are to be resolved against you.

4

MR. PICKETT:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I hope you'll be careful when you

6

give the narrative account to make sure that you limit

7

yourself to the sort of things you're justified in arguing

8

on this posture.

9

MR. PICKETT:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

Respondents did not even challenge Kodak's evidence on

11

interbrand competition.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, so on whom is the burden of

proof in that situation in the trial court?

14

MR. PICKETT:

Well, the burden of proof, of

15

course, is on plaintiffs.

16

fact that Kodak has presented evidence in its initial

17

motion for summary judgment does place the burden on them

18

to come forward with significant, probative evidence --

Since they -- you say they had the

There were affidavits in opposition to

MR. PICKETT:

Well, they would have the

obligation to put forward those affidavits.

MR. PICKETT:

Yes.
They did not do so.

And

1

2

therefore, they failed to meet their burden.
QUESTION:

Do you take the position that it

3

necessarily follows that if there was competition in the

4

equipment market, that there could -- the same degree of

5

competition in the parts market?

6

MR. PICKETT:

7

QUESTION:

8

I'm sorry?

Does your argument about the original

equipment market necessarily mean that there's the same
amount of competition in the parts market?

10

MR. PICKETT:

It necessarily means that the

11

manufacturer's dominant -- the answer is no.

12

It necessarily means --

13

QUESTION:

14
15

So shouldn't we focus our attention

on the parts market?
MR. PICKETT:

No, because the interbrand

16

equipment market plays a dominant role on the derivative

17

after-markets for parts and service.

18

Kodak's -- the manufacturer's --

1

QUESTION:

20

MR. PICKETT:

21

Kodak's dominant incentive in this case, to use

Is that undisputed too?
That is undisputed, absolutely.

22

the words of Justice Scalia in the Sharp Electronics case,

23

is to sell equipment.

24
25

QUESTION:

And its dominant incentive -Well, it also wants to sell parts,

doesn't it?

(800) FOR DEPO

MR. PICKETT:

1

It wants to sell as much of its

2

total package of goods, and therefore it must price its

3

total package of goods at a competitive price.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that argument.

5

But are you saying as a matter of law, the fact that

6

there's competition in the -- well, you are, I guess -- in

7

the original equipment market, means there's an equal

8

amount of competition in the parts market?

9
10

MR. PICKETT:

No, no.

I'm not saying that.

I'm

saying that - QUESTION:

11

Well, is it conceivable that there

12

could be, say, patented parts, for example, which there

13

could be no competition?

14

MR. PICKETT:

Certainly there could be patented

15

parts.

16

competition at the interbrand equipment level would offer

17

those consumers the choices that they want in that market.

18

And they would choose among the various packages that are

19

offered by the various manufacturers.

20

Manufacturers have options.

But even in the case of a patented part, the

They can choose

21

service by themselves; they can choose service offered by

process -- will win or fail, as consumers decide.

24

manufacturers like Kodak come up with product offerings of

25

equipment, parts, and service, that are designed in

It's those options that can -- in the competitive

And as

1

various innovative ways, it's the -- it's the

2

manufacturer's freedom to design those particular packages

3

that offers the competitive process to work.

It is certainly a law of

It is also -QUESTION:

8

This is a law

Because this case comes up to us

after very little discovery.

And it just seems hard for

10

me to, I would imagine, writing an opinion setting forth

11

all the propositions you make, without some factual

12

background to support what I'm -- what you're saying.

13

QUESTION:

Your Honor, we put in a fully

14

detailed, factual background, in our motion for summary

15

judgment.

16

by respondents.

The fact is, that that was not rebutted at all

17

Moreover, as to discovery, Judge Schwarzer told

18

respondents that they should go out and take discovery on

19

the issue of market power, which is what we're arguing

20

about today.

21

They took extended depositions.

They took

22

complete document discovery.

MR. PICKETT:

1

All three, they were entitled to.

2

The fact is, they never sought discovery in the equipment

3

market area.

4

But it's no -- they are not --

QUESTION:

I take it, their theory of the case

5

is they don't have to, because there's a separate market

6

for parts and services.

7

MR. PICKETT:

Well, if one defines a separate

8

market, or attempts to, one has to overlook the connection

9

between interbrand equipment market and the derivative

10

after-market for parts and service.
There's no evidence that could isolate that

11
12

parts and service market from the activity going on in the

13

equipment market in this case.

14

QUESTION:

Well, there certainly is.

There's

15

evidence - - as I understand the record - - that there were

16

independent organizations that sold parts and services

17

separately from your company, for a period of time, until

18

you changed your policy.

19

MR. PICKETT:

20

some sales of that.

QUESTION:

Isn't that right?
There is evidence that there were

MR. PICKETT:

QUESTION:

6

So they can be -- at least

7

conceivably, that's evidence that indicates they can be

MR. PICKETT:

9

Well, they can be sold separately,

Your Honor,

in isolation from the impact of the interbrand equipment

Well, there's a 3-year period where

Well, but I'm just -- it was 3 years

competition was enhanced, since Kodak was free to offer

its product offering in an innovative way.

3

Manufacturers should be free to offer their

4

equipment with service options that cover the

5

gamut -- from long-term warranties, on the one-hand,

included in the initial price, to very low equipment

prices, with higher service charges down the road; from

service offered by manufacturers, alone, on the one hand,

14

What is -- what case do you think

MR. PICKETT:

The case that most strongly

15

supports our position is Sharp Electronics, Your Honor.

16

In Sharp Electronics, a price cutter, retailer price

17

cutter, was terminated in part due to the manufacturer's

18

dominant incentive to ensure the provision of service, and

19

customer support at the retail level.

in combination with another retailer, surely it can be

done by Kodak, itself.

MR. PICKETT:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.
But your point is that you could not

monopolize that market without paying the price in your

6

that extent?

7

MR. PICKETT:

Absolutely.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. RILL

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

5
6

MR. RILL:
the Court:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

There are two, central points to the argument of
the United States in this case.

9

First, the ISO claim that Kodak can possess and

10

exploit market power in the parts and service market, when

11

it lacks market power in the equipment market, is

12

implausible, as a matter of antitrust law and economic

13

theory.

14

Second, when a plaintiff, seeking to avoid

15

summary judgment, attempts to put forward an implausible

16

argument, or argument based on an implausible theory, it

17

is required under rule 56 and under this Court's decision

18

in the Matsushita case, to come forward with particularly

19

persuasive, probative, and substantial evidence in support

20

of a cogent theory of antitrust liability.

21

QUESTION:

You say then that Matsushita, or

22

Matsushita, as you pronounce it, laid down a different

23

rule as to summary judgment for antitrust cases than

24

prevails in the rest of the legal area?

25

MR. RILL:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not.

The

1

rule for summary judgment is, of course, prescribed in

2

rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and in

3

particular, rule 56 (e) .

4

proposition that this Court recognized that in antitrust

5

cases, where conduct can be often ambiguous and can permit

6

an inference of procompetitive as well as anticompetitive

7

conduct, it is particularly appropriate to use the vehicle

8

of summary judgment to prevent the deterrence of

9

procompetitive conduct that would result from the threat

Matsushita stands for the

10

of costly,.time-consuming, and antitrust trials,

11

particularly where they proceed on a per se theory.

12

QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals, as I

13

understand its opinion here, took the position that maybe

14

things wouldn't work out in the real world, so to speak,

15

the same way they do in economic theory.

16

district court might have been justified in granting

17

summary judgment as a matter of pure economic models, that

18

was not necessarily controlling, so far as summary

19

judgment would be concerned.

20

MR. RILL:

Yes, Your Honor, it's the position of

21

the United States that the court of appeals erred in

22

reversing summary judgment on the grounds of some

23

generalized -- with all respect -- speculation with

24

respect to market imperfections that might exist.

1

that it was not contested, that it lacked market power in

2

the equipment market, it became incumbent upon the ISO's

3

under rule 56 and under Matsushita, to come forward with

4

specific, substantial, probative evidence that raised a

5

genuine issue as to a cogent theory of antitrust

liability.

Mr. Rill, the issue wasn't whether

there was competition in the equipment market.

5

MR. RILL:

How can we

Well, if Kodak had attempted to tie

6

service to equipment, clearly that would fall under the

7

Court's decision in the Hyde case, because it lacks market

8

power in the equipment market.

9

Why should a stricter standard be applied to

Kodak when, in fact, it has exercised a less-restrictive

11

policy of tying service to parts?

QUESTION:

If we disagree with that.

If we say

2

that the parts and the service market are separate

3

markets, as to which a separate standard of competitive

4

conduct is required; then must we reverse?

5

MR. RILL:

You would then have to still make a

6

determination that market power would have to exist in the

7

equipment market, because in the absence of market power

8

in the equipment market, it is implausible for Kodak to

9

attempt to exercise market power in the parts market, so

With respect to your market definition question,

I will certainly say that this case could have come up,

could have come up on the issue of whether parts is a

separate, relevant market.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought we were proceeding on

16

the assumption -- for argument purposes -- that there was

17

a separate market in parts?

18

MR. RILL:

For purposes of the way this case is

19

before the Court now, it's the position of the United

States, we're willing to accept a separate market and say

that it cannot be exploited in the absence of market power

Whether there is a parts market, and whether

component, whether or not you can get source of supply, as

MR. HENNEFER:

2

QUESTION:

3

That is

All of these facts become quite

irrelevant.

4

MR. HENNEFER:

That is correct.

If there's a

5

one-to-one correlation or a close to one-to-one

6

correlation between raising the prices in the equipment

7

market, and -- or in the parts market and people not

8

buying equipment, that's correct.

9

But of course it's our primary contention here,

10

that that kind of a per se rule of immunity should not be

11

accepted.
QUESTION:

12

Well, they're not saying it's a per

13

se rule.

14

should be assumed to be the norm, and you have to come up

15

with some evidence on the motion for summary judgment to

16

say why the world is not as it seems; or rather, whether

17

your theory should be the norm, and they would have to

18

come in to show why the world is not as it seems.

19

What the argument is about is whether that

MR. HENNEFER:

Well, it's more than a norm.

20

They want to say once a defendant comes up with proof that

21

there is competition in the basic equipment market, then

22

the case is over.

23

then, in the parts or service market, have any market

24

power or dominance of those markets.

Because you cannot, as a matter of law,

1

that.

I understand them to be saying only that you have

2

to come up with something to show why this particular

3

market has an imperfection.

4

For instance, if you could have shown that the

5

purchasers of the parts, and of the service, don't take

6

into account the life -- the life cost of equipment plus

7

service -- if you could have shown that, I don't think

8

they're contesting that the case couldn't have gone

9

forward.

10

What they're saying is, you didn't come up with

11

anything that wouldn't -- that would give anybody any

12

reason to believe that this market doesn't operate the way

13

a market operates.

MR. HENNEFER:

Your Honor, in fact, we did come

up with substantial record evidence of this.

It's Kodak

17

Let me give you a few examples.

18

We came up with evidence of a purchaser, a copy

19

shop, Mr. Hernandez, who buys photocopy machines and who

20

is aware of the price of service, because he also was

21

giving some outside service -- who bought Kodak's machines

22

knowing that they were charging two to three times the

23

price that a private servicer would charge for it.

that a knowing purchaser takes something else into account

Kodak has not come forward.

Okay, so you didn't come up with

12

something that would show that the market has a lack of

information.

14

MR. HENNEFER:

Justice Scalia, in other

15

situations -- if I may give a few more examples.

For

example, the purchasers of the Federal Government, one

17

group on a capital budget will purchase machines without

18

any regard to how the service for those machines are going

to be paid for.
That will then be given to a particular

department.

And then that department, on its operating

budget, has to pay for those -- that service.

have come forward with specific facts in this marketplace

that show -- and it's -- the burden is on us, initially,

14

to come forward with specific facts on the record.

couldn't regain the money on the service.

that you had admissible evidence or indicated that you

MR. HENNEFER:

As was lodged with the court, and

the court was asked to take judicial notice of it, Xerox,

who is Kodak's main -- actual only -- competitor now,

5

virtually their only competitor -- there is a duopoly in

6

high-speed copiers -- initially, in 1987 --up until

7

1987 -- had a policy where they would allow ISO's.
And we presented record evidence - - that on the

8

9

basis of that, Xerox's prices for an equivalent machine to

10

Kodak's, for service, for a yearly contract, were one-

11

third of what Kodak's services were.

12

Xerox, after Kodak, adopted its policy in

13

cutting off parts, and putting ISO servicers in the

14

photocopy business, out of business -- adopted the same

15

policy that Kodak adopted, in the United States and

16

Canada.

against Xerox and said that Xerox cannot monopolize and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONN P. PICKETT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PICKETT:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to

clear up one point, with respect to your question
concerning.affirmative defenses and burden.
Market power is an essential element of both

11
12

respondents' tying claim, and their monopolization claims.

13

As an essential element, respondents had the burden of

14

proof on that element.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

There is - -

Well, do you have a -- case authority

for that?
MR. PICKETT:

Certainly, every monopolization

18

and market power -- Jefferson Parish for tying, and Aspen

19

or any other monopolization case, says that there must be

20

the requisite economic power on the part of respondents.

21

Now, Kodak presented evidence on this case,

22

first of significant, robust, interbrand equipment

23

competition in its declarations.

24

QUESTION:

Second, that buyers --

1

Do you agree with his

characterization of the remainder of the market?

just two or three other companies?
MR. PICKETT:

7

No, he's left out the Japanese

manufacturers, who are significant.
QUESTION:

Is it

Canon --

What percentage do they represent?

Do they show?
MR. PICKETT:

8

Back in 1 86, they represented in

the high-volume segment of copiers, approximately 10
10

percent; in the lower-volume areas, they were the dominant

11

competitors, along with Xerox.
Kodak presented evidence of interbrand

12

13

competition.

14

buyers take into account those future service and parts

15

costs.

16

Kodak sets its prices for parts and service, based on what

17

those sophisticated buyers will do in the interbrand

18

market.

It presented evidence that the sophisticated

And it took -- and it presented evidence that

Now, in response to that, what did respondents

20

do, and what more could Kodak have done to present its

opportunities by Judge Schwarzer, over the remaining 6

QUESTION:

3

They presented a

May I just ask this question?

They

4

didn't offer theoretical evidence.

5

relied on kind of folksy evidence, that, in fact, the

6

service was less expensive, provided by the competitors,

7

and that sort of things, at pages 10 and 11 in their

8

opinion.

implausibility of the case, in which -QUESTION:

Oh, but if those were typical

19

examples, and if the competitors' prices were roughly half

20

of yours, isn't that some --at least a scintilla of

21

evidence that maybe there was some market power in the

22

service market?

evidence, it's not the significant, probative evidence

QUESTION:

1

So the question goes as to how much

2

weight to give to that evidence, not whether there's any

3

there at all.

4

MR. PICKETT:

They didn't present any evidence,

5

not even a scintilla, of a fundamental change in the

6

workings of the marketplace that would separate the

7

equipment market from the parts and service market -- none

8

that showed how that would work.

9

lock-in theory.

Their only theory was a

That was the only theory they presented

10

to Judge Schwarzer.

And as this Court held in Jefferson

11

Parish, the proper time to assess market power in that

12

instance is at the time of purchase, since that's

13

when -- that's when the competing offers are being

14

considered by the purchasers.

15

QUESTION:

And co - -

You -- you and your colleague on the-

16

other side have quite a different notion about what

percentage of the parts that Kodak makes and what

percentage does it buy.
