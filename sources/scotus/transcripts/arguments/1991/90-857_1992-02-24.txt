Just a minute -- all spectators are

The Court remains in session.
MR. SHEPPARD:

On September 5, 1988, petitioner,

16

Marc Doggett, was arrested in Reston, Virginia, where he

17

had lived with his wife for the past 5 years.

18

period, petitioner had worked full-time, attended school,

19

obtained his associates degree, bought and sold two

20

houses, voted, paid taxes, used credit cards, attended

21

church, and had a driver's license.

22

During that

This arrest concerned allegations of illegal

23

activity that had occurred during September through

24

December of 1979 which resulted in indictment in February

25

of 1980, some 8-1/2 years prior to petitioner's arrest.

1

The Government takes the position that because

2

petitioner did not know about the indictment, or was not

3

jailed, then he must show prejudice in order to prevail on

4

his Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial.

the Government, the Sixth Amendment has nothing to do with

Excuse me, why do you say that?

I

mean on what do you base the assertion that that is the

13

interest it is intended to protect?

14

speedy trial could mean a lot of things.

15

for example, that a trial should not last more than a

16

month or more than 2 weeks, or that you should have no

more than half an hour for lunch.

Now that is obviously not what it means, is it?
It doesn't mean that the trial shall go quickly.

MR. SHEPPARD:

QUESTION:

Respectfully --

Now, how do we determine which of the

22

various meanings it might have, it in fact does have?

23

do you suggest we go about determining that?

MR. SHEPPARD:

I think you have to take into

because it departs dramatically with the language that

14

And this Court consistently in several cases has

Now if Mr. Doggett had not been indicted, the

15

statute of limitations, which was 5 years, would have run

16

and we wouldn't be here, because his motion to dismiss,

17

upon his arrest 8-1/2 years later, would have been granted

by any judge.

MR. SHEPPARD:

I certainly do, Chief Justice.

It does -- unless it is a secret indictment, under

15

that one ought to be able to find solace in that language.

I agree that it frustrates the

Unfortunately, the

If you had a statute of limitations clause in

the Constitution, you could point to this situation and

21

say, well, this is obviously frustrating the statute of

23

happen.

But there is no statute of limitations clause.
There is only a speedy trial clause.

14

The indictment clearly triggers Mr. Doggett's

15

right to a speedy trial.

16

this Court has, in the past, indicated that the Sixth

17

Amendment is unique from the other first ten amendments in

18

that it not only protects the rights of the accused, but

19

the public has an interest here.

20

interest is to have individuals who have been indicted,

1

very few exceptions.
QUESTION:

2

Well, I don't know that we should say

3

that the speedy trial clause is kind of a substitute for a

4

statute of limitations -- which sounds like part of your

5

argument.

6

Certainly Congress could provide, at the same

7

time it enacts a statute of limitations, that there should

8

be only such a, perhaps, a 3-year delay after the issuance

9

of an indictment things should be dismissed.

10

But Congress

hasn't done anything like that here.

11

Congress controls the statute of limitations.

12

MR. SHEPPARD:

Most definitely.

However, the

13

Sixth Amendment is analogous to the statute of limitations

14

in order to protect the right to an indictment.

15

the right to be indicted under the Fifth Amendment.

16

if the Government, knowing that there's a statute of

17

limitations, can obtain an indictment and do absolutely

18

nothing to bring the person before the court, then they

19

subvert the purpose - - we respectfully submit - - of the

20

right to speedy trial, as well as the statute of

21

limitations.

22

QUESTION:

We have
And

Well, in the absence of a statute of

23

limitations -- which is an act of legislative grace, so to

24

speak -- you could indict someone 20 years after they

25

committed the offense.

Barker v. Wingo, the four-factor analysis:

to the Sixth Amendment, provide a practical solution to

2

these unique, old-time cases.

3

is that where an accused has no knowledge of the

4

indictment pending against him and the time period

5

equivalent to the applicable statute of limitations has

6

run, the Government should bear the burden to establish

7

that the accused has not been prejudiced by the delay.

And that bright line rule

8

Respectfully, they will not be able to

9

prove -- carry their burden on prejudice any more than any

10

citizen of this country can carry his burden to show that

11

he's prejudiced from an unknown allegation brought to his

12

attention 8-1/2 years later.

13

QUESTION:

That's not a very bright line, Mr.

14

Sheppard.

15

your right to a speedy trial begins to run when you're

arrested.

17

you're indicted, if it's the Government's fault

that -- that you haven't yet been arrested, though you've

been indicted.

You want a bright line, a bright line is that

Not that -- your line is it begins to run when

If it's not the Government's fault, then your

right to a speedy trial has not been affected.

That's not

know someone has committed a crime, and a grand jury of

ORAL REARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BRYSON:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
First let me address one of the suggestions in

14
15

this case, that the practice that occurred here would

16

become commonplace; that there is -- the suggestion is

17

that there is some incentive for the Government, or any

18

prosecutorial agency to delay for an extended period of

1

time --

21

QUESTION:
you're saying.

Mr. Bryson, I'm not hearing what

Would you repeat it again, please?

22

MR. BRYSON:

Certainly.

23

Let me address first the suggestion that there

24

is an incentive on the part of a prosecutorial agency to

25

delay bringing people to trial after they've charged them.

1

The suggestion is made that this will become a commonplace

2

event.
Our answer is that that simply is not so; that

3
4

we have every incentive as prosecutors to bring these

5

cases to trial quickly -- because as has been pointed out

6

on several occasions by this court, typically the passage

7

of time hurts the prosecution, which has the burden of

8

proof, much more than it hurts the defense.
Cases grow stale, witnesses become unavailable,

10

and these kinds of events tend to hurt the prosecution.

11

And typically, defendants are benefited by the passage of

12

time.

13

But - -

14

QUESTION:

15
16

How do you explain the delay in this

case?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, the delay in this case, Your

17

Honor, was that we went to the home where this person was

18

residing; we advised the person who was there, the mother,

1

a member of the family, that there were charges against

20

the individual; we sought him.

21

We then discovered, after she advised us that he

22

had gone to Colombia, we discovered that he was in Panama.

23

We took steps at that point to ensure that after he was

24

released from custody in Panama that he would be

25

immediately turned over to the United States for return to

1

the United States and prosecution.
And as a matter of fact, the findings below were

2

3

that everything that we did, up to and including that

4

step -- which is a 2-1/2-year period -- was reasonable.

5

There's no suggestion of unreasonable conduct prior to

6

that time.

7

Now, there were two events that occurred during

8

that time that, in one case, there was a delay in putting

9

his name into a computer because the agent had assumed

10

that he was in a different computer system.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRYSON:

13

But those were found,

specifically --

14
15

But there are --

QUESTION:

But there are 6 more years to account

for.

16

MR. BRYSON:

That's right.

17

After he was released from Panama, we had

18

assumed that he would be turned over to us; the

19

Panamanians did not do that.

20

He went, as we discovered later, immediately to Colombia.

21

At that point, when the agent found out that he

Instead, they released him.

22

had gone to Colombia, he assumed that he would be in

23

Colombia for some extended period of time.

24

returned to the United States, he would be found at the

25

border.

And if he

reasonable, a reasonable assumption that he would be found

when he came back across the border.

crowded that it is very difficult to catch everybody that

comes through -- even if they're on the NCIC computer

system.

In fact, he came

And we didn't catch him.
Now, the suggestion -- the finding, in fact, of

the magistrate, upheld by the court of appeals, was that

10

we should have done more after that time to find him in

11

this country.

12

We should have checked.

And, in fact, it was several years before we did

13

a sweep - - one of these general fugitive sweeps - - that

14

uncovered him.

15

Now, we suggest in our brief, two points with

16

respect to the alleged negligence:

17

that we were not under a continuing obligation, for all

18

time, to take every step that was possibly available to us

19

to find him.

MR. BRYSON:

I think we could leave in place

14

what amounts to a passive system which is, his name's in

the computer, we are expecting, if he ever comes through a

MR. BRYSON:

7

Your Honor, the regular sweeps have been a

8

fairly recent innovation, thanks largely to enhanced

9

computer capacity that we have -- only in the last few

10
11

years.
In fact, it wasn't until 1988 that DEA

12

transferred to the Marshal Service the responsibility for

trying to pick up DEA fugitives.

MR. BRYSON:

Exactly.

Under Barker, we think

21

that even if we were negligent in violating a duty that we

22

had to continue to search for this man, that our

negligence in that regard, under the Barker test, would

not justify dismissal of the charges.

That's

right.

3

QUESTION:

And why?

No prejudice because just an interest

talking about?

7

MR. BRYSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRYSON:

That's correct.
And what is Barker talking about?
Barker is talking about prejudice

10

of three different sorts, Your Honor:

11

detention -- the prejudice that results from pretrial

12

detention or its substitute, the restraints imposed by

13

bail; two, the kind of anxiety and concern about the

14

pendency of charges -- which this man could not possibly

15

have suffered, because he, by his claim, is that he wasn't

16

aware of the charges; and three, the possibility of

17

prejudice at trial.

18

QUESTION:

19

So you accept the fact, for making

this argument, you accept the fact he didn't know.

So what we've got is a case in which there is,

Barker, and the Court's decision in More against Arizona,

How can we consistently say, though,

that the Sixth Amendment imposes at least the bad faith

criterion, and say as a matter of principle it can't

possibly impose a negligence criterion?

that line?

MR. BRYSON:

Why do we draw

the due process clause in that respect.

I think the speedy trial clause may go farther than

But again, what we're saying is that if the

Government seeks to simply say to you we're not going to

resolution of these charges -- then I think you have a

problem, under this Court's decisions in Barker and More

9

against Arizona.

10

As I understand it, then, the

11

if the Government intentionally does not proceed with an

arrest that it could make.

14

whether it is also -- that's the limit of the Government's

MR. BRYSON:

there would be no prejudice, no possible prejudice to his

talk -- it's a quote that is -- that trickles through all
of the cases; it depends on the circumstances.
And I respectfully submit the circumstances in
this case are - QUESTION:

But in a way, the whole Sixth

Amendment speedy trial right, when it is found to favor
the defendant, is in the interest of repose.

So to say

that in Barker was an attempt to break down all the
subsidiary factors that would justify repose, to
incorporate repose among the subsidiary factors really is
kind of a double counting, isn't it?
MR. SHEPPARD:

Respectfully, I think that the

interest that I'm suggesting needs protection is for those
individuals who, because of their lack of knowledge, and
because of the Government's negligence in bringing them
before the bar of justice, that they ought to have
protection because of their actions.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr.

Sheppard.
MR. SHEPPARD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 11:53 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
