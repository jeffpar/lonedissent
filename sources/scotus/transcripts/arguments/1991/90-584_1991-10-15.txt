CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 90-584, Southwest Marine, Inc., v. Bryon
Gizoni.
Mr. Tichy.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. TICHY, II
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TICHY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents the issue whether land-based
maritime employees, specifically included in the coverage
of the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act,
nonetheless are entitled to go to a jury trial to
determine their alleged status as Jones Act seamen.
The facts of this case are very straightforward,
as it comes to this Court after reversal by the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals of a summary judgment issued by
the District Court of the Southern District of California.
The respondent, Bryon Gizoni, is a rigger and
rigger foreman for petitioner, our client, Southwest
Marine.

One day while working on a floating platform, a

platform commonly used for ship repair work and devoid of
navigational qualities, Gizoni was injured when his foot
went through a hole in the platform.

Typical of any ship repair person, Gizoni filed

for an obtained Longshore Act benefits.

obtained in excess of $18,000 worth of benefits, which he

4

then used as he went out forward, not only to take care of

5

his medical needs, but we assume, to bring a Jones Act

6

claim, seeking to get an even bigger recovery by ignoring

7

the administrative process and invoking the full processes

8

of the Federal court system, including the use of a jury

to determine his alleged seaman status and his Jones Act

What makes Gizoni's Jones Act claim peculiar and

12

bizarre is that he is land based.

can also make out a Jones Act claim, regardless of

sure I get something straight in my mind?

MR. TICHY:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, you certainly can.
If he wins the Jones Act claim,

21

assume you lose, just for purposes of argument, will you

22

be entitled to a credit for the amount paid on the

23

Longshoreman Act claim?

7

over the years with regard to the ambiguity as to whether

8

or not one is in fact a Jones Act seaperson.

9

It is not provided in the Jones

In fact, there is language in the Longshore Act,

10

which is specifically section 3 (e), which provides for a

11

credit in the event one mistakenly gets payments under the

12

Jones Act or some other State compensation form of

13

coverage.

14

Essentially what has happened here, Justice

15

Stevens and members of the Court is this:

16

the Longshore Act was passed, this was the first time in

17

which Congress had an opportunity to deal with the void

18

which had been created in the law.

19

deal with the stevedores and longshoring people.

20

the years what happened unfortunately was that there was a

21

recognition through the situs test, as opposed to the

22

status test which was developed in 1972, that essentially

23

what would happen is that a person could walk in or out of

24

coverage under the Jones Act.

25

in 1927, when

1

before the passage of the Longshore Act to try and bring

2

stevedores within the Jones Act, simply to avoid this

3

problem of coverage.

4

But what happened was the Congress took the

5

baton and started roll -- running with it, if you will,

6

and determined essentially, that it would set forth a law

7

in which it could provide coverage for those who were

8

injured upon navigational waters who were nonsea people

9

and additionally, by the passage of the 1972 amendments,

10

in essence, were able to cover those who were on the

11

adjoining areas.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tichy, the plain language

13

of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act excludes from

14

coverage any repairman who is a member of a crew of any

15

vessel, and it seems to me that your position just reads

16

that right out of the statute.

17

MR. TICHY:

To the contrary, Justice O'Connor.

18

You know, I wrestled with the arguments that were raised

19

by the Solicitor, as well as by Mr. Gizoni's counsel, and

20

I guess the way that you have to deal with the issue that

21

you raise is you have to go back to the statute and you

22

look at the language which Congress used.

23

Congress divided those who were maritime

24

employees into two types, and the unique language they

25

used was shall be included, and shall not be included.

We

are talking about fundamental Aristotelian logic.

case includes harbor workers, which are a specifically

MR. TICHY:

act, when it was amended in 1 84, however, eliminated the

accordingly.
MR. TICHY:

Thank you, Your Honor, and I

certainly will.
In any event, Justice O'Connor, the term "a

master and a member of a crew," as you pointed out is the

20

equivalent of a Jones Act seaman.

21

And as such, was specifically excluded from the

22

Longshore Act, but as the language was used, and

specifically in Section 2(3), the term employee means any

MR. TICHY:

Couldn't do it.

There are situations where an

individual is land based, which is the other pivot in the

Wilander decision --

QUESTION:

No, but the exception talks about

people who are vessels.

That's right.

will --

QUESTION:

20

Mr. TICHY:

What about a vessel --- for weeks, and was taking care of

that vessel out there, outside the 3-mile limit, that

individual would probably be a master or member of the

No, I am asking about the use of the

Indeed, there are vessels that do

not leave the harbor.
QUESTION:

11

And a person who is a member of a

12

crew of such a vessel is not a ship repairman within the

13

meaning of the statute, even if he spends all his time

14

doing ship repair work.

15

MR. TICHY:

Isn't that right?

I would submit to you that it was

16

the 1972 amendments that clarified that if that individual

17

worked exclusively within the harbor, that that individual

18

would in fact be covered by the Longshore Act.

He would not be on a vessel, even

1

purposes of the Longshore Act - -

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TICHY:

Right.
-- that the 1972 amendments made it

4

clear that there are those individuals who work

5

exclusively within the harbor, exclusively, if you will,

6

within the break-water, who are not subject to the type of

7

perils of the sea which a normal seaman is; therefore,

8

Congress used the term "harbor worker" to specifically

9

indicate a form of inclusion.

10

I would point out to you, that is not the issue

11

that we have here because this is a ship repair person who

12

is part of a shipyard who is repairing something

13

essentially next to the shore.

14

But the use of the term "harbor worker," I would

15

submit to you, is intended to necessarily exclude from the

16

inclusion of a master or a member of a crew of a vessel,

17

those people who work exclusively within the confines of a

18

harbor because -- there are a number of reasons.

19

One is, Congress created the Longshore Act with

20

the object of having a no-fault, uniform system of

21

compensation.

22

recognized that those people who are normally covered are

23

land based.

24
25

Secondly, Congress in doing this,

Those who work within the harbor areas --

about someone who is not land based.

about somebody who is based on a vessel that floats around

were land based because of the term used -- "harbor

worker."

5

You say we should treat him as though he

MR. TICHY:

I would submit that that is in fact

6

the case, and I cannot imagine a situation in the real

7

world where an individual is assigned to a vessel that

8

operates strictly within a harbor who is not land based.

9

And in fact, I think that really is a pivot in the

10

Wilander decision, the recognition which the Court came

11

to, essentially, which was that if you are talking about

12

somebody who was land based, it was the intent of Congress

13

to provide them with this uniform method of compensation,

14

this no-fault method of compensation to avoid multiple

15

awards, to avoid the multiplicity of litigation, to avoid

16

the problem that you alluded to about the possibility of

17

inconsistent results or the necessity to achieve --

18

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this question.

Maybe

19

we have got the wrong case here, but supposing you have a

20

case in which there are good arguments on both sides of

21

the question of whether a person is under the statute or

22

under the Jones Act?

administrative types of procedures, and in particular, we

cite the Court to the National Labor Relations Act type of

situations, where Congress has established an

administrative agency with expertise in the particular

7

past is where someone is arguably covered by that

8

administrative act, where an agency such as the OWCP has

9

administrative expertise, the obligation on the party

10

asserting the claim, which is an arguable claim, must

11

first go through that administrative agency before

attempting to burden the courts in any manner, shape, or

QUESTION:

So before that, there was no such

requirement.
MR. TICHY:

What happened was, prior to '72

i '*l\

12

there was only a situs test and therefore, what was

13

happening was that an individual had to establish, in

14

order to obtain coverage, that he was not a seaman under

15

the Jones Act.

16

his injury occurred upon navigable waters.

17

That's what he had to establish, and that

What happened in 1972 is that Congress

you, essentially, the same type of approach which was

8

contemplates and allows the employee to attempt his Jones

10

Rather than immunizing shipyards from Jones Act

And I will tell you why I believe that.

Section

11

903 of the Longshore Act, paragraph (e) says

12

notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any amounts

13

paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or

14

death for which benefits are claimed under this act,

15

pursuant to any other worker's compensation law or Section

16

20 of the act, and then it describes in parentheses, 46

17

U.S. Code 688, parentheses, relating to recovering for

18

injury or death of seaman shall be credited against any

19

liability imposed by this act.

20

So that provision gives a credit under the

21

Longshore Act for any benefits paid under the Jones Act.

22

So they realize that some people may take the Jones Act

23

route first.

24
25

There is another section of the Longshore Act
that I believe specifically gives -25

QUESTION:

1

Excuse me, it doesn't necessarily

2

recognize that.

I mean, it may have just been a voluntary

3

payment, assuming that the person was entitled to them

4

under the Jones Act, right?
MR. EASLEY:

5

I agree with that, it doesn't

6

authorize a Jones Act claim, but it contemplates that a

7

worker who is employed in one of those occupations might

8

seek Jones Act benefits.
QUESTION:

9

MR. EASLEY:

10

Yes, but -- okay.
There is another provision in the

11

Longshore Act that I believe more specifically gives a

12

shipyard employee a right to go under the Longshore Act

13

first, although it doesn't specifically say that, and that

14

is Section 913(d) of the Longshore Act, Filing of Claims.
And it says, tolling provision:

15

where recovery

16

is denied to any person in a suit brought at law or an

17

admiralty -- and the Jones Act is law and maintenance and

18

cure are admiralty -- to recover damages in respect of

19

injury or death on the ground that such person was an

20

employee and that the defendant was an employer within the

21

meaning of this act, and that such employer had secured

22

compensation to such employee under this act, the

23

limitation of time prescribed in subdivision (a) shall

24

begin to run only from the date of termination of such

25

suit.

So I interpret that to say, if you work for a

1

2

shipyard, you can go file your Jones Act lawsuit, and if

3

the trier of fact finds that you are covered by the

4

Longshore Act, that you are not excluded as a vessel crew

member, then that tolls the statute and they keep your

6

Longshore Act remedies alive so you can come back and

reenter the Longshore Act.

MR. EASLEY:

I have a description of a maritime

They included taking care of lines at docks, tightening or

slackening them as necessary, repairing leaks, pumping out

You don't think that there was

of those odd decisions that occurred some years back that

made everything, including questions of law, a jury

Wilander liberalized the situation, and in another way it

combined issue of fact and law rather than just fact; but

12

it, by getting rid of the aid to navigation test, that

probably swung open the biggest door that has ever been

14

swung open since the courts have been defining seaman

15

status.

16

It restricted it by making it a

So I think Wilander ultimately makes it a lot

easier to prove seaman status, because you had so many

cases where people were performing functions on vessels

and the vessel had no transportation function.

was a dredge or used to pump waste oil or something like

that.

So I think that Wilander opened it up quite a bit.
There is also an interesting sentence in

5

here.

6

And that's Mr. Gizoni's position

As far as making seaman status a factual issue,

7

Wilander creates some bounds for it, but it still, I

8

think, leaves it pretty wide open because it says, if

9

reasonable persons, applying the proper legal standard

10

could differ as to whether the employee was a member of

11

the crew, it was a question for the jury.

12

And I think that's a scenario --

In this case, if you prevail and it

goes to the jury, does the jury determine both whether or

has said, this is just not a vessel in navigation for

7

Jones Act purposes, and I'm not saying that those should

8

be thrown to the jury every time and let the jury overturn

9

these legal decisions.

But I agree with the language in

10

Wilander that when reasonable minds can differ, then it's

11

a question that should go to the jury.
I want to point out something else about how

13

ridiculous this occupation test is if you want to read it

14

literally.

15

the outer continental shelf by the Outer Continental Shelf

16

Lands Act, and the occupations enumerated in the Outer

17

Continental Shelf Lands Act are workers involved in

18

exploring, developing, removing, or transporting natural

19

resources of the outer continental shelf.

20

And that is, the Longshore Act is extended to

So if we are going to devise a statutory

21

occupational test, then I guess every member of a crew

22

23

used in this offshore oil drilling and exploration and

24

transportation would fall under the Jones Act.

So if we are

That's why the occupational test is too

The Court has made a similar ruling or a ruling

10

in a case similar to this.

11

12

versus State workers' compensation jurisdiction for the

first 3 miles offshore.

And there is a footnote by the

14

"Floating structures have been

treated as vessels by lower courts.

16

unlike workers on fixed platforms, enjoy the same remedies

17

as workers on ships."

18

It is a footnote in Gray v.

Workers on them,

So I think there is some precedent that says

19

that there is no Longshore Act exclusion from people in

20

those occupations seeking seaman status.

21

Something that's an interesting comparison that

22

has come into my own mind with regard to your Wilander

23

case is virtually every shipyard has a paint barge.

24

That's a barge that has scaffolding permanently mounted on

25

2

unusual to have a system where an individual painting a

fixed oil rig from a boat could have seaman status, but a

man painting a vessel from a floating barge that moves

5

And I would think it

In a lot of these cases that were decided by the

around a lot in this litigation.

17

that raises a real interesting question as to who makes

this determination as to who is arguably covered by the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

4

MR. LONG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Let me begin by saying a word about this primary

7

jurisdiction point.

8

including its 1 72 amendments or the Jones Act for

We see no basis in the Longshore Act,

concluding that Congress intended to remit the
10

determination of seaman status to the special expertise of

11

the Secretary of Labor.

12

Juries have been making that determination under

13

the Jones Act since 1 20.

14

admiralty have been making that determination since long

15

before that, and in fact, we think a provision of the

16

Longshore Act refutes the primary jurisdiction argument.

17

Federal courts sitting in

Section 13(d), 33 U.S.C.

13(d) tolls the

18

statute of limitations under the Longshore Act, in the

1

event that a suit is brought at law or in admiralty.

20

think if the Secretary were meant to have primary

21

jurisdiction, there would be no reason to have a tolling

22

provision, certainly not a perfectly general tolling

23

provision such as 13(d).

Would the court

Or he shouldn't issue it?

I would think not, after -- it is

perfectly clear after Wilander that seaman is linked to

courts.

MR. LONG:

regulation, even though he is issuing it under --

13

MR. LONG:

If it is a reasonable interpretation

14

of the phrase "master or member of a crew of a vessel."

15

And I draw that conclusion from the Court's holding in

16

Wilander that master or member of a crew restates who is a

17

seaman under the Jones Act.

18

QUESTION:

All right, and then suppose he

issue preclusion.
Our position in this case does rest on the plain

2

3

language of the statute.

4

under the exclusions of Section 2(3) of the Longshore Act,

5

that a ship repairman, if he or she is a member of a crew

6

of a vessel, is not covered by the Longshore Act and is

7

entitled to a remedy under the Jones Act.

8

We do think it's quite clear,

If the ship repairman has a sufficiently
permanent connection to a vessel in navigation, which may

10

be a vessel that stays entirely within a harbor, and if

11

that ship repairman contributes to the function of the

12

vessel or the accomplishment of its mission, which may be

13

a special purpose, then that repairman would meet the

14

definition of a seaman or a member of a crew.

then cuts out various subcategories, including a master or

9

That's Section 2(3)(h).

That's Section

We think it is quite clear

We also think petitioner's position to contrary

10

to this Court's recognition in Wilander that seaman status

11

is not a pure question of law, but a mixed question of law

12

and fact; and therefore, if reasonable persons, applying

13

the correct legal standard could differ as to whether the

14

employer was a member of a crew, it is a question for the

15

finder of fact.

16

QUESTION:

Do you think it is a question of law,

17

whether a vessel is a vessel?

18

MR. LONG:

It can be, Your Honor.

We think in

19

certain cases it would be quite proper for the District

20

Court to decide that question as a matter of law.

MR. LONG:

1

I think to be honest that in doubtful

2

cases, there is some incentive to go ahead and litigate

3

the issue.

4

We think the legislative history supports the

5

plain language of the statute.

6

that the original 1927 act actually had a provision in it

7

at one point that would have extended the Longshore Act to

8

crew members of all vessels owned by U.S. citizens, and

9

that was taken out.

I think it is worth noting

10

The Court discussed that in South Chicago Coal

11

against Bassett, and the '72 amendments which added this

12

more expansive definition of maritime employment were .

13

intended to extend the coverage to certain injuries on

14

land, not to restrict --

15

QUESTION:

Can I ask another question about

16

tactics in this situation?

17

not, if an employer could afford to do so, he would be

18

better off generally, in a doubtful case, to litigate the

19

Jones Act claim first because that tolls the statute of

20

limitations for the other, right?

If you are right, would it

21

MR. LONG:

Yes.

So that would be the normal way to do

it is to litigate rather than filing a claim and taking

the risk that you would get an adverse adjudication.

MR. LONG: I think in practice in many cases, of

we think would still leave a lot of uncertainty about

whether particular workers are covered, and the situation
