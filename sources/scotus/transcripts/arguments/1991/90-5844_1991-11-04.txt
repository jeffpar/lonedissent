ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. MANASSEH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MANASSEH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Once an insanity acquittee has regained his

11

sanity, may the Government continue to confine him in a

12

mental institution indefinitely solely on the basis that

13

he cannot prove that he is no longer a danger to society?

14

Terry Foucha was found not guilty by reason of

15

insanity back in 1984.

16

regained his sanity.

17

hearing back in 1988.

18

answered in the affirmative that once an individual has

19

been found not guilty by reason of insanity, he must, in

20

order to gain release, prove that he is no longer a danger

21

to himself or to society.

22

Since that time he has since
And it was established at a release

statutory scheme violates the Fourteenth Amendment due.

1

Terry Foucha's plea was accepted pursuant to a

2

statute in Louisiana that allowed the judge to accept his

3

plea with the concurrence of the respondent's office.

4

Since that time, as I said, he's regained his sanity.

5

that's been established at the release hearing in 1988.

6

He has since remained in limbo because the statutory

7

scheme in Louisiana requires that in order to gain release

8

the individual must prove that he is not a danger to

9

himself or society.

10

And

The problem is that the statute makes irrelevant

11

his present mental condition.

12

whether he is mentally healthy or whether he's not.

13

makes that determination irrelevant to whether he can

14

regain, whether he can ever gain release from the mental

15

institution.

16

It does not consider
It

In Jones v. United States, this Court stated

17

that the Constitution permits the Government to continue

18

confinement indefinitely of an insanity acquittee until

19

such time as the individual regains his sanity or is no

20

longer a danger to himself or to others.

21

We believe that once he regains his sanity, the

22

indefinite custodial confinement of this insanity

23

acquittee must cease and cannot be based any further on

24

his finding of not guilty by reason of insanity.

25

QUESTION:

In Jones, the Court was dealing with

1

a statute, was it not, that required both of those

2

findings?

3

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, it did deal with a

4

statute that required both of those findings.

5

the way the Louisiana supreme court differed and found, as

6

opposed to our position, that the insanity acquittee is

7

entitled to release once one of those two things is

8

established.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

And that's

Do you think Jones supports your

position or is simply neutral?
MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, I think that Jones

12

supports our condition because Jones specifically says

13

that the Constitution - - and the Louisiana supreme court

14

ignored the reference to the Constitution in that

15

particular holding.

16

In addition, I would suggest --

17

QUESTION:

But in Jones, the Court was dealing

18

with a statute that required both of those.

19

that statute is constitutional.

20

MR. MANASSEH:

21

QUESTION:

And it said

Yes.

It doesn't necessarily follow, I

22

would think, the statute which required less from the

23

State than the Jones statute is unconstitutional.

24
25

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, I would suggest that

the statute, the reasoning in Jones specifically

said

2

meant in Jones -- but if the nature and the duration of

3

confinement must be reasonably related to the purpose of

4

initial confinement, and his initial confinement is based

5

upon the fact that he was found not guilty by reason of

6

insanity, and therefore, his confinement must continue

7

because he is continuing to be mentally ill and dangerous,

8

once he establishes that he is no longer

9

dangerous -- excuse me.

10

and I'm not here to tell the Court what the Court

Once he establishes that he's regained his

11

sanity, then the finding of dangerousness that the

12

Louisiana statute allows is not related to the mental

13

illness for which he was originally committed for.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Manasseh, what about a statute

15

like in the State of Washington that, for someone who is

16

acquitted in a criminal case as not guilty by reason of

17

insanity and is then committed to a mental institution for

18

a specific term of years that might, for example, be

19

related to some equivalent penalty for the offense.

20

Do you think that under circumstances such as in

21

this case that such an individual likewise would have to

22

be released?

23

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, I believe that there

24

can be certain circumstances, if a statute is narrowly

25

tailored and specifically defined such as the situation of

1

a regulatory detention, that the State could have

2

interests that outweigh the individual's liberty interest.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, do you concede that a statutory

scheme such as Washington State's is valid?

5

MR. MANASSEH:

QUESTION:

MR. MANASSEH:

Yes.

8

it is valid.

9

issue as of this time.

10

Do I concede that it is valid?

I do not necessarily concede that

I don't think this Court has ruled on that

But the Washington statute is different than

11

Louisiana's, Your Honor.

12

with whether the individual is fit to be released.

13

doesn't deal with just a dangerousness test as the

14

Louisiana supreme court indicated in their opinion.

15

dealt with whether the individual could show that he was

16

fit for release.

17

QUESTION:

The Washington statute deals

Let's put it this way.

It

It

Suppose

18

Louisiana were to put a cap on the period of time in which

19

someone could be held and put a limitation on it.

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, we may not be.

Would

In

22

that situation the Government's interest with a narrowly

tailored, specifically defined statutory scheme

24

might -- in those circumstances, the Government's interest

in societal protection might outweigh the individual's

liberty interest.
But the statute we have here requires an

3

indefinite confinement, perhaps a lifetime confinement,

4

for all insanity acquittees, no matter what their charge.
QUESTION:

5

Counsel, if you prevail here what

6

happens?

7

call contradictory hearing?
MR. MANASSEH:

8

9

Is he released?

Or is there another what you

Your Honor, I believe that what

would happen would be the matter would be sent back to the

10

district court to make a specific finding -- factual

11

finding whether he is in fact not mentally ill or not.

12

The testimony at the release hearing, by the

13

State's own witness, indicated that he was no longer

14

mentally ill.

15

specifically state on the record that he found that he was

16

no longer mentally ill.

17

uncontroverted in the record.

19

The trial judge, though, did not

But that evidence was

But that would be a factual determination for
the trial court to make.
QUESTION:

20

Is your argument based on the

21

assumption that he can be held only for treatment and not

22

for preventative purposes?

23

argument?

24
25

MR. MANASSEH:

Doesn't that underlie your

That would underlie the argument

under one phase of a substantive due process argument that

1

once an individual has proven himself to no longer be

2

mentally ill, he could no longer be indefinitely confined

3

in a mental institution.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MANASSEH:

Suppose he's dangerous.
Under those circumstances, Your

6

Honor, just as I said, the Government may be able to

7

fashion a statutory scheme similar to a Salerno situation

8

that in those circumstances the Government interest would

9

outweigh the individual's liberty interest.
I'm not here to give the Louisiana legislature

10
11
12

any - QUESTION:

But I take it then that you must be

13

saying that without some subsequent hearing, an acquittal

14

by reason of insanity permits the State only to treat the

15

insanity and not to incarcerate in order to prevent danger

16

to others or to himself.

17
18

MR. MANASSEH:

No, Your Honor.

I'm sorry,

respectfully, but that is not necessarily what I'm saying.

19

The dangerousness that Louisiana commits an

20

individual who has been found not guilty by reason of

21

insanity is because he's insane and that finding, as Jones

22

points out, is sufficient to establish continuing mental

23

illness and his dangerousness.

24

illness is cleared up, then^the dangerousness should not

25

be just a uniform, any sort of dangerousness.

But once his mental

It should

1

be some sort of a dangerousness related to his mental

2

illness.

3

QUESTION:

Well, what's your authority for that?

4

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, at that point I would

5

suggest that an Addington-type hearing should be called

6

for in order for the Government to make some sort of a

7

showing that he is, in fact, dangerous, that it's not

8

related necessarily to the mental illness to justify his

9

continued confinement.
QUESTION:

10

Well, why can't the Government base

11

it on his conviction, but for insanity, of aggravated

12

burglary?

13

MR. MANASSEH:

14

sure I understand your question.

15

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not

Well, as I understand the Louisiana

16

procedure is found not guilty by reason of insanity, which

17

means that the jury found he did commit the aggravated

18

burglary.

25

MR. MANASSEH:

As I pointed out before, Your

Honor, there was not a jury in this situation.

illness which he had.

10
11

QUESTION:

Why does it have to be?

Why can't

Louisiana simply say this man committed an aggravated
burglary and we're going to confine him?
MR. MANASSEH:

At that point, Your Honor, I'm

12

not saying that the Government could not make that sort of

13

a showing, but it seems as though that procedural due

14

process would require that the Government make that

15

showing pursuant to Addington because the burden of the

16

individual trying to prove nondangerousness is a untenable

17

type of burden to maintain.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But the Government did once sustain

that burden in the criminal proceeding.
MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, he was found not

21

guilty by reason of insanity.

22

QUESTION:

But doesn't that mean that he was

23

found to have committed the crime, but was not culpable by

24

reason of insanity?

25

MR. MANASSEH:

Theoretically, that's what that

1

means.

If the Court looks at the judgment on page, I

2

believe, it's 5 of the Joint Appendix, the judgment

3

indicates that the court accepted a not guilty and not

4

guilty by reason of insanity judgment.

5

from looking at that judgment and looking at the record

6

whether the trial court actually made a factual

7

determination that he was in fact guilty of a criminal

8

offense at that time.
QUESTION:

9

So it is unclear

Well, then, is this case simply a

10

sport?

I mean, a peculiar fact situation?

11

took the case to decide whether someone who was found not

12

guilty by reason of insanity could be confined after they

13

were no longer ill.

14

MR. MANASSEH:

15

that's why the case was accepted.

16

Yes, Your Honor.

I thought we

I believe

My point is is that it's -- you're unable to

17

make the determination by looking at the record whether

18

the individual actually committed a criminal offense to

19

begin with.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, what assumption did the supreme

court of Louisiana go on?
MR. MANASSEH:

They made the assumption that the

23

theoretical basis of a not guilty by reason of insanity

24

plea is guilty, but insane.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, well, I think we would probably

1

go on that same assumption.

2

MR. MANASSEH:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Manasseh, in what way are the

4

conditions of confinement in a mental institution more

5

restrictive or oppressive than the kind of confinement

6

this Court upheld in Salerno, pretrial detention?

7

MR. MANASSEH:

Well, for one thing, Your Honor,

8

the detention in this case is indefinite.

9

lifetime confinement.

10

It can be a

In Salerno it was for a very

limited duration based upon the Speedy Trial Act.
Secondly, Your Honor, the Salerno act targeted

11
12

only the most dangerous of criminals.

13

any insanity acquittee, no matter what sort of offense

14

that he committed, whether it's a DWI, a minor misdemeanor

15

theft, or whether it's a first-degree murder situation,

16

any insanity acquittee is refused to be released unless he

17

can prove himself not to be a danger.

18

QUESTION:

Does your equal protection claim add

19

anything to the due process claim?

20

and amount to the same thing?
MR. MANASSEH:

21

22

Honor.

23

same thing.

24
25

This act allows for

1

a result of his mental illness.

2

it's a violation of equal protection to have a dual

3

finding in a civil commitment statute, but only to require

4

and allow the Government to confine an individual

5

criminally if he fails to prove himself nondangerous, even

6

after he's shown to be not mentally ill.

7

QUESTION:

We would suggest that

But even where the statute provided

8

for a limit, say, of 2 years on any confinement which

9

could be maintained after the mental illness has

10

disappeared and if the Government had the burden, say, by

11

clear and convincing evidence to prove continued

12

dangerousness after that point, would you find a

13

constitutional infirmity in that?

14

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, at that point, again,

15

I would say that I believe that the Government may, under

16

certain circumstances - -

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well, how about the circumstances I

just gave you?
MR. MANASSEH:

I would have to look more deeply

20

into the circumstances, Your Honor.

21

know that that would - - that that would be

22

unconstitutional pursuant to Salerno.

QUESTION:

All right.

I don't necessarily

1

violence rather than, say, dangerousness in some belated

2

sense of just committing further crimes like

3

check-writing, say, real dangerousness to the health or

4

safety of other human beings.

5

By the same principle that you, I think, have

6

just conceded, could the Government not confine

7

individuals for periods of 2 years without there being any

8

preceding criminal charge and without there ever being any

9

finding of insanity?

Could the Government, in other

10

words, simply say we're going to round up dangerous

11

individuals and if we can prove by clear and convincing

12

evidence that they are dangerous, we will confine them for

13

2 years subject to a renewable commitment with the burden

14

being on us?

15
16
17

Would that be constitutional?

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, I don't necessarily

know that that would be constitutional.
QUESTION:

What's the difference between that

18

case and the case that I gave you in which the insanity

19

had been cured and the Government could keep the person in

20

for 2 more years subject to the burden of proof?

21

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, of course there's a

22

distinction when the Government has shown that the

23

individual has at one time committed a criminal act.

24
25

QUESTION:

And is that distinction because the

proof of dangerousness is more reliable?

Your Honor, I don't know
more reliable.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MANASSEH:

Once his mental

Then what is the distinction?
Your Honor, because once the

6

criminal act had occurred the individual is not

7

necessarily in a position to prove that he cannot at some

8

point not present a danger.

9

QUESTION:

No, but in my -- in the example that

10

I'm giving, in each instance the mental illness is cured

11

or disappeared.

12

Government has a burden at that point either to release

13

the person or to prove by clear and convincing evidence

14

that the person remains dangerous.

15

A period of 2 years go by.

The

And I thought your answer was that if that

16

situation arose following a not guilty by insanity plea,

17

it could be constitutional for the Government to keep the

18

person in for another 2 years, to renew the commitment.

19

But I thought you were saying that if there had

20

not been a preceding NGI or a preceding offense giving

21

rise to that, that the Government could not do that

22

constitutionally.

23

the one instance and not in the other.

24
25

And I want to know why you can do it in

MR. MANASSEH:

the act has already occurred the Government can make a

1

limited, carefully drawn, regulatory detention.
QUESTION:

2

I know that's the conclusion that you

3

come to, but why do you come to it?

4

fact of the preceding criminal offense lends a greater

5

weight to the soundness of the finding of dangerousness

6

which it subsequently makes?

7

reason?
MR. MANASSEH:

8

9

Is it because the

Or is there some other

Yes.

It's because of the fact

that the Government has already shown that in certain

10

circumstances while he is mentally ill he may in fact be a

11

danger.
QUESTION:

12

13

Yes, but on my hypothesis, he's not

mentally ill anymore.

14

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, again, the reason

15

being is because the fact that the individual had suffered

16

from a mental illness and was dangerous at one time may

17

support that sort of a finding.

18

The Louisiana district attorney's office out of

19

Orleans Parish suggests that the Government's interest in

QUESTION:

Well, you say indefinite, there's a

hearing every 6 months?

8

MR. MANASSEH:

9

Your Honor, there's a hearing and

he's entitled to a litany of different hearings.

The

10

problem is is that when the burden is on the individual to

11

prove nondangerousness, he can have a hearing every day,

12

every other day, and it is not going to make that burden

13

any more reasonable for the individual to meet.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I recognize that there's some

15

negative aspects to it, but the statute is fairly

16

specific.

17

that support a reasonable expectation of a substantial

18

risk that he will inflict physical harm upon another

19

person in the near future.

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, when the individual

3

has already committed an act and the judge can rely upon

4

the testimony of a doctor who has seen him for just a

5

short period of time to testify that he refuses to certify

6

that the individual is not a danger, this doctor will

7

never certify that he's not a danger.

8
9

If this Court does not reverse the Louisiana
supreme court, Terry Foucha will, in all likelihood,

10

remain at that mental institution for the rest of his life

11

because Dr. Ritter is never going to certify, and no

12

doctor will ever certify, that anyone will not be a

13

danger.

14

And Dr. Ritter --

15

QUESTION:

Is it clear that that finding would

16

have been made if there had been no showing of the

17

specific incident, I think he put a pencil or an object

18

through another inmate's hand?

20

trial court?

One of the problems that I think procedurally

14

the case has is this unbridled discretion that the trial

judge is given to disregard the recommendation of the

16

superintendent, the recommendation of the review panel who

17

recommended specifically at page 10 of the Joint Appendix

18

that he could be released, he is no longer insane, and

19

that he could be released without danger to himself or to

20

others.

21

The doctor, Dr. Ritter, comes in and testifies,

that he wouldn't be a danger to himself or to others.

the Government may be able to come in and make a carefully

But this type of indefinite confinement based

upon his failure to be able to prove nondangerousness

As far as the equal protection argument goes,

17

this Court stated that in Baxstrom that the fact that a

18

person has suffered and been convicted and was sentenced

19

to a specific sentence, that that was not, that was

20

insufficient to justify giving him less protection than

21

those given to individuals who are civilly committed.

22

I would certainly suggest that an individual

A convicted felon, when his term of sentence is up, he is

There are a lot of dangerous people

12

MR. MANASSEH:

There certainly are, Your Honor.

But the dangerousness of my client is not -- for

which he was originally sentenced for was because he was

15

dangerous in relationship because he was mentally ill.

16

Once his mental illness has been cured, then the

And that was the reason that an insanity

QUESTION:

Does that necessarily follow, though?

4

I mean, an insanity acquittal, what, in Louisiana means

5

that you weren't able to appreciate the consequences of

6

your act?

7
8

MR. MANASSEH:

It means that you did not

understand right from wrong, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

Well, but does that necessarily

10

explain why the defendant did, committed this particular

11

crime?

12

That doesn't go to his motivation.
MR. MANASSEH:

No, Your Honor.

The reason it

13

doesn't go to his motivation is because a person who is

14

found not guilty by reason of insanity has no criminal

15

intent to commit a crime, just as an individual who maybe

16

makes a mistake and commits a criminal act or who doesn't

17

act in self-defense --

18

QUESTION:

Now, is that Louisiana law or is that

19

your speculation about what it might mean?

20

certainly isn't accepted everywhere that someone who is

21

found not guilty by reason of insanity lacks the intent.

22

Because it

I think in many States that is regarded, not

23

guilty by reason of insanity, is an affirmative

24

defense -- that the State can make out all the other

25

elements including intent, and you can still say you have

1

an affirmative defense, not guilty by reason of insanity.

2

So in many States it does not negate intent.

3

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, in Louisiana it means

4

that they didn't understand right from wrong.

5

didn't understand right from wrong --

6

QUESTION:

And if they

But that's a non sequitur to say that

7

they didn't understand right from wrong, therefore, they

8

didn't have the necessary intent.

9

MR. MANASSEH:

Your Honor, I would suggest that

10

is someone doesn't understand what's right from wrong,

11

then they couldn't have criminal intent to commit a

12

criminal act.

13

QUESTION:

If the State of Louisiana in its

14

aggravated burglary statute requires that the State show

15

that a person entered a dwelling in the nighttime with the

16

intent to enter in order to commit a felony, it seems to

17

me the State could prove every one of those elements, and

18

including the intent, the intent to enter the dwelling

19

with intent to commit a felony.

20

And you -- the fact that a person didn't know

21

right from wrong would be, would go to insanity.

wouldn't go to the lack of intent at all.

just about a situation in which the Government can tell a

2

young man that he's not guilty because he was sick,

3

because he was ill, and then refuse to release him from a

I'm confused.

Stevens that dangerousness is not a medical concept.

inconsistent.
