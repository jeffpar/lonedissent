ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
BARBARA J. NORMAN, ET AL.

10

MR. PINCHAM:

11
12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
We are here today because the Democratic Party,

14

partisan politics, continues to permeate the Illinois

15

judiciary up to and including the Illinois Supreme Court.

16

The October 12, 1990, order of the Illinois

17

Supreme Court completely disregarded this Court's

18

precedent in Illinois State Board of Elections v.

19

Socialist Workers Party and Moore v. Ogilvie.

20

importantly, not only did it disregard the precedent

21

previously set by this Court, but it was a flagrant and

22

blatant attempt to limit political opposition to the

23

existing Democratic Party machine.

Harold Washington Party is now the second largest

QUESTION:

It regularly out-polls the

Mr. Pincham, is it the same party?

mean that's one of the controversies here.
MR. PINCHAM:

Indeed it is, Your Honor.

I

hasten to point out to Your Honor that the Illinois

10

legislature has promulgated no statute or regulation

11

controlling the expansion of an established political

12

party from one jurisdiction or one subdivision of the

13

State into the next.

14

Washington Party from the ballot was a judicially

15

contrived remedy by the four Democratic Party justices of

16

the Illinois Supreme Court, and indeed, contradicted the

17

rule of law as previously set forth by that court in

18

Anderson v. Schneider.

QUESTION:

The striking of the entire Harold

How do - - how do we know that it was

the same party?

21

MR. PINCHAM:

22

QUESTION:

The record is --

All the record says, if I recollect

23

it, is that the city Harold Washington Party had no

24

objection to the use of the name.

Actually it went further than

I

that, Your Honor.

The leader of the city Harold

Washington Party and the founder of that party appeared
before the county officers electoral board, and went even
further and said not only is it the same party, I give my
permission to expand this party outside of the
municipality of Chicago and into suburban Cook County.
The record is clear on that point.
Moreover, and I hasten to point out to Your
Honor, that there is no competing group here saying no,
this isn't the Harold Washington Party, we are.

There is

but one Harold Washington Party, and references to the
contrary by opposing counsel are simply misrepresentations'
of the fact.

There is but one Harold Washington Party,

and it now seeks to expand beyond the city limits of
Chicago and into Cook County.
The question then becomes - QUESTION:

Was that evident to those who had to

make the initial judgment -MR. PINCHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

-- as to whether the party had the
i

proper number of signatures?

I mean, in retrospect, maybe

we can say, well it is one in the same.

But was that

evident to those that had to make the judgment?
MR. PINCHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, indeed it was.

From what?

That testimony was

Where is that?
Where in the record before you?

Yes.

And you don't have to give it

to that part of the record, I'd be --

MR. PINCHAM:
to, Your Honor.

17
18

Certainly, I'd be more than happy

QUESTION:

What did the supreme court of your

State say about this matter, about the party?

19

MR. PINCHAM:

Frankly, Your Honor, that's one of

20

the reason's we're here.

They said nothing.

They simply

entered an order striking the Harold Washington Party from

QUESTION:

Well, so you don't know why they

struck the Harold Washington Party?
MR. PINCHAM:

We know the reasons that the

4

dissenters gave for disagreeing, but the opinion analyzing

5

the reasons for striking the Harold Washington Party were

6

not fully set forth in an opinion.

7

Democratic Party judges of the Illinois Supreme Court in

8

effect ruled is that, contrary to the prior precedent of

9

this Court, this political party much have, not 25,000

What the -- four

10

petition signatures, but 50,000 signatures, and that those

11

50,000 signatures must be divided geographically 25,000

12

from the city of Chicago, and 25,000 from suburban Cook

13

County outside the city of Chicago.

14

I point out to Your Honor that the total number

15

of signatures required statewide for the entire State of

16

Illinois is only 25,000 signatures. Thus, the ruling of

17

the Illinois Supreme Court would not only require twice

18

the number of signatures, but would require those

19

signatures be obtained from a smaller portion of the State

20

than, of course, the entire State itself.

21

So in ruling that --

22

QUESTION:

So you think they couldn't write the

23

opinion, that's why they never wrote it.

24

write itself, you think.

perfectly candid and frank with Your Honor, I think that

2

the opinion would have been an embarrassment to the

3

justices of the Illinois Supreme Court.

5

QUESTION:
didn't they?

Well, the court also changed, though,

I mean, there were new justices so - -

MR. PINCHAM:

6

Yes, Your Honor, but it did not

7

change between the date that Justice Stevens issued the

8

initial stay or the date upon which the full Court issued

9

the stay and December 6.

The court had 2 months within

10

which to write that opinion.

And of course, that opinion

11

was not written.

12

faith, or intended to act in good faith, it could have

13

asked this Court, for example, to stay its proceedings*and

14

to give it an opportunity to write its opinion so that

15

this Court would have the benefit of the analysis of the

16

four Democratic Party justices of the Illinois Supreme

17

Court.

Moreover, had the court acted in good

But that, too, was not done.

18

More importantly, or perhaps equally

19

importantly, the Illinois Supreme Court did not

20

distinguish its own prior opinion in Anderson v.

21

Schneider.

22

and perhaps irreconcilable dilemma of co-petitioner Cook

23

County Officers Electoral Board.

24

the untenable position of trying to reconcile

25

self-contradictory language of the statute.

We are, of course, sensitive to the precarious

First, the statute provides that the entire

1

2

petition shall contain not more than 25,000 signatures as

3

the minimum requirement.

4

of the statute, Section 10-2, it provides that each

5

component of the petition shall provide 25,000 -QUESTION:

6

Elsewhere, in the same section

So I take it your principal argument

7

is that the each component portion of the statute is

8

invalid.

9

MR. PINCHAM:

Well, as the three Republican

10

justices of the court pointed out, that need not be

11

reached.

However, and I also point out to this -QUESTION:

12

Well, but is that one of your

13

principal contentions before us?

14

MR. PINCHAM:

15

18

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

16
17

That it is invalid?

QUESTION:

Now, what's your best authority for

that?
MR. PINCHAM:

It is invalid because this Court

19

said in the Socialist Workers Party case and in Moore v.

20

Ogilvie, that it is unconstitutional to require a third

21

political party to obtain more signatures on its petition,

22

nominating petition ballots, than are required for an

23

entire State.

QUESTION:

Suppose that in your case the

requirement was for a total of 25,000 signatures, roughly

could have, say 40, percent of your signatures from the

suburban area and 60 percent of the city.

QUESTION:

MR. PINCHAM:

9

What result

That, too, would be

Why?
-- under this Court's ruling in

Moore v. Ogilvie, because then you would in effect give

10

veto power to suburban voters as the Harold Washington

11

Party expands from the city.

Party is strongest --

QUESTION:

Where the Harold Washington

And that is so even if the signature

14

requirement were in proportion to the number of registered

15

voters in each of the districts?

MR. PINCHAM:

No.

that constitutional infirmity.

Your Honor, the statute does not say that.

But I hasten to point to
The

Well, I'm trying to find out the

21

rationale for your argument so that if we do decide to

22

write an opinion we can.

(Laughter.)

24

MR. PINCHAM:

25

I base my argument and the

rationale of my argument on this Court's prior decisions
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

in Moore v. Ogilvie and Socialist Workers Party, along

2

with the rationale employed by the Illinois Supreme Court

3

in Anderson v. Schneider, where, in that case, the court

4

ruled that even if the party failed to file a full slate,

5

for one reason or another, the remedy is not to exclude

6

the entire party from the ballot.

7

rationale that I urge upon this Court at this time.
We further “point to this Court that in ruling on

8

9

And that is the

the objections, the Cook County Officers Electoral Board

10

considered the fact that the objections themselves were

11

not properly obtained.

12

Electoral Board ruled that they did not consider the

13

manner in which they were obtained to be fraudulent, it is

14

clear that false affidavits were submitted to the County

15

Officers Electoral Board with those objections through the

16

nominating petition of the Harold Washington Party.

17

Generally, such false affidavits submitted to a tribunal

18

will result in the objections for other document being

19

stricken in its entirety.

While the Cook County Officers

That was not done here.

Had that been done, of course, we would not have

20
21

the problem that we're faced with today.

In reviewing the

22

statute, I would point out to Justice Kennedy that the

23

burden of analyzing the statute has been removed from this

24

Court.

25

of the State of Illinois, has interpreted that State

1

statute in a manner that is repugnant to the Constitution

2

as previously set forth by this Court's rulings in

3

Anderson -- I'm sorry, in Socialist Workers Party and

4

Moore v. Ogilvie.

5

So as we stand here today, Your Honor, we urge

6

upon this Court to enforce its own prior decision over the

7

Illinois Supreme Court, which did not deem fit to bless us

8

with its opinion before the justices changed, nor have

9

they taken any effort subsequent to that change to rehear

10

the case and to provide us with an opinion.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Pincham, can I ask you this

12

question?

13

understand, well, putting aside the name problem for a

14

minute, just the 50,000 vote requirement.

15

requirement applies to the commissioners who are elected

16

from the suburbs and to the officers like State's Attorney

who ran county wide.

The county-wide offices would only

21

require 25,000.

22

the city of Chicago itself would require 25,000 and those

23

running from suburban Cook County would require 25,000.

24

Those running county wide could combine their signatures

25

with either one or the other.

QUESTION:

1

No, but the effect of the Illinois

2

Supreme Court's decision, as I understand it, is to

3

disqualify the entire ballot.

4

MR. PINCHAM:

5

QUESTION:

6

Even though those running for like

State's attorney had more than 25,000.

7

MR. PINCHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Because they, in effect, require

50,000 for those offices.

And I understand your position

10

on those officers and on the county commissioners running

11

from the suburbs -- rather from the city -- from the city.

12

But now with respect to the county commissioners

13

running from the county only, the suburban area, they did

14

not get 25,000 signatures from the suburbs.

15

MR. PINCHAM:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And you nevertheless contend they are

17

entitled to be on the ballot, too.

18

which you differ with the election board.

19
20
21

MR. PINCHAM:

This is a point in

That is exactly correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And I don't think you've explained

why the Socialist Party case supports you with respect to

those candidates.

of Appeals, is that the total number of signatures, the

total number for the entire petition, is 25,000.

statute that provides for each component to have 25,000,

also says that the entire petition shall not be -- shall

not be required to exceed 25,000.

8

The language of the statute itself is self-contradictory.

And that alone would invalidate the statute.

10

It has

We shouldn't be involved in

of Illinois from saying that if you want to run from the

We also point out the obvious that -- Chicago

MR. PINCHAM:

what's unconstitutional about it.

running for places on the suburban.
MR. PINCHAM:

3

He asked about those as well as

the county-wide offices.

QUESTION:

Perhaps I should clarify.

I did originally.

I said I

understand your position on the county-wide officers and

on the commissioner residents of Chicago who are elected.

7

MR. PINCHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, sir.

I'm asking for further enlightenment

only with respect to your argument pertaining to the

10

county commissioners elected from the suburbs.

11

that's the point in which you differ with the election

board.

13

MR. PINCHAM:

That is correct.

I think

That is correct.

14

We don't know what that provision would provide, Your

15

Honor, because the supreme court of our State has not

16

addressed that adequately to give us any insight.

17

QUESTION:

Well, if they say that you didn't get

1

The case -- I think you're

2

referring to the Socialist Workers case in particular,

3

that case says unless there's a good reason.

4

Workers was a situation, Your Honor, where because of this

5

Court's decision in Moore, the City of Chicago had

6

requirements for ballots, ballot nominations, three times

greater than the State of Illinois.

that down and in effect amended -- our legislature did it,

but in effect amended the State law to say 25,000 was the

And this Court struck

cap.

But in that very case, that 25,000 that this Court

11

was talking about was the 25,000 from Chicago.
And this Court recognizes, Justice Stevens

12

13

recognized in his footnote 3 of that opinion, that the

14

25,000 requirement was a requirement for all political

subcomponents.

Sangamon and Cook County are two counties,

So the distinction isn't between the

Evans Harold Washington Party and the Pincham Harold

Washington Party.
It's the distinction between the

5

Chicago Harold Washington Party and anything else.

6

MR. ADAMSKI:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

MR. ADAMSKI:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ADAMSKI:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

It didn't say why, but it said that.
Yes.

And you would say because it was a

14

new party and a new party can't use the same name as an

15

old party.

16

MR. ADAMSKI:

It can use somebody else's name.

17

The party continuity issue there is a different issue.

18

You can't -- they can't come forward and say we're going

19

to use somebody else's name when the name's already been -

20

- in use. They can't do that.

I'd like to think so.

If it has the permission of the

old party.

7

QUESTION:

It depends on what you mean by a new

8

party.

A new party in the political unit, in the sense

9

that it's new to that political unit, can use the name of

10

an old party from another political unit.

A party can expand, but it has to
