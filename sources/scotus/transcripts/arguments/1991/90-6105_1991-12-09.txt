We'll hear argument

Mr. Abbott.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. MICHAEL ABBOTT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ABBOTT:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The two issues presented in the case of Evans v.

10
11

the United States have to do with first, under the Hobbs

12

Act, title 18, United States Code, section 1951(b)(2),

13

whether an affirmative act of inducement by a public

14

official such as a demand or threat has to be shown by the

15

Government in an extortion case under color of official

16

right.

17

The second issue presented is whether, in the

18

absence of that Hobbs Act conviction, should we be

19

successful here, the petitioner was properly convicted for

20

making a false statement on his income tax return when he

21

failed to report a $7,000 payment given by an FBI

22

undercover agent.

QUESTION:

MR. ABBOTT:

Yes.

Thank you.

The petitioner was convicted on one

count of extortion, one count of false statement that was

Briefly, in summarizing the facts, in March of
1 85 the FBI began an undercover investigation of John
Evans that was to continue for approximately 31 months.

10

They were investigating allegations that there was public

11

corruption in zoning matters.

12

posed as a land developer who was new to the Atlanta area.

13

They first met with Evans in March of 1 85.

14

essentially was one in which they indicated they would

15

be meeting with governmental bodies.

16

he would be glad to assist them if he were able to, and he

17

made no attempt to recontact them after that meeting.

18

The agent, the FBI agent,

scenario is much the same except that that particular

20

meeting was videotaped.

21

began or it began to heat up in May of 1 86, because at

22

that time Evans was running for reelection as a

23

commissioner of DeKalb County, Georgia.

24

it would be his second term.

In May of 1986, in a meeting

with the undercover agent and some associates, Evans was

asked if in fact he needed any expenses.

He sent a thank-you note.

10

he spent approximately $300 that month for his precinct

11

mailing.

12

He was not charged for that particular event.
The focus of this particular case concerns the

13

events of July 23rd, 24th, and 25th, 1986.

14

another meeting on July 8th prior to that in which a

15

specific parcel of land was identified by the undercover

16

agent as one they were interested in rezoning.

17

18

the undercover agent.

19

undercover agent did not record either the first call or

20

the third call.

over the years.

Evans' contention is he did not condition his

17

assistance on any payment to him whatsoever.

18

undercover agent admitted as much on cross-examination,

19

that Evans did not condition his assistance.

20

Circuit agreed in their opinion that in fact Evans did not

21

condition his assistance, but they said he's not required

22

to.

public official accepts a payment and he knows that that

payment is made to him to influence his official action,

that is sufficient.

of them appear to pay some lip service to the word

say that the power of the office itself provides all the

coercion necessary.

Circuit says.

Although the nine circuits, or most

And in fact, that's what the Eleventh

Now at common law, I suppose, that

11

would have been the case, that extortion under color of

12

right would not be said to require inducement.

13
14

MR. ABBOTT:

There certainly are cases, Justice

O'Connor, under common law, in which that is true.

QUESTION:

MR. ABBOTT:

Quite a few.
There are quite a few.

In fact, at

common law it was a -- the offense was a misdemeanor.

Many of those cases are cases - -

QUESTION:

What difference does that make?

I

20

know you make that point in your brief, and say well, it's

21

more serious here, I don't see what difference that would

22

make.

23

MR. ABBOTT:

I think it makes a difference

24

because when you back to 1946 when the Hobbs Act was

25

passed, it seems unlikely to me that Congress intended to

take a common law misdemeanor in which you could commit

2

the offense by passive acceptance and put it into a

3

statute aimed at professional gangsters where the problem

4

was coercion, violence, and extortion, and make it a

5

20-year felony without giving an explanation.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I guess everyone agrees that it

7

was patterned -- that color of right aspect was patterned

8

after the New York law?

9

MR. ABBOTT:

We certainly contend that, and I

believe the Government does also, although at least they

11

did in the McCormick case.

13

misdemeanor.

15

What it appears to be, if I understand it correctly, is

16

something like a bill collector who collects fees for the

17

body politic.

18

charges you more than you're supposed to pay, or he

19

charges you when you don't really owe anything, or he

charges you before it's actually due.

We do not prosecute the

There is no better case, I think, that blurs the

undercover role, was clearly the aggressor in the

scenario.

MR. ABBOTT:

19

It simply seems very unlikely to me that when

Yes, I do.

20

the Hobbs Act was passed in 1946, Congress intended to

21

make this common law misdemeanor into a 20-year felony and

22

allow passive acceptance, where in fact the statute itself

23

was aimed at violence, at coercion, and at extortion.

24

It

century scheme of collecting fees at a time when the

2

people who collected those fees were basically paid.

3

QUESTION:

Do you think inducement requires more

4

than just acceptance of money by somebody who holds an

5

office that if he acts in a certain way it will help you?

6

MR. ABBOTT:

I do, Your Honor.

I think that you

7

have to ignore the plain meaning of the word extortion,

8

not to say that inducement requires more than that.

9

In its brief in McCormick, the Government

10

said -- took a position that I agree with -- that the

11

common understanding of extortion is obtaining money by

12

consent when that consent is induced by some kind of

13

future threat.

14

statutes on the books of the Federal Government today, in

15

title 18, virtually every one of them, and I think every

16

one of them, either talks about a demand or a threat.

17

Those are, it seems to me, the two key words for

18

extortion --

19

And if in fact you look at the extortion

12

13

present in all the extortion statutes, and certainly in

14

the title 18, 1951(b)(2).

15

I think that is the

Mr. Abbott, you certainly could read

MR. ABBOTT:

2

I think -- I find that a strange

reading.

that argument in this case, although they took the

5

opposite argument when the McCormick brief was -- when the

6

McCormick case was briefed and argued back in January.

I note with interest that the Government makes

7

It's -- certainly the easiest way to have done

8

that, if that's what Congress intended, would have been to

put the under color of official right language at the

beginning and the other language at the end.

11

that would have been clear.

12

you have take the language with his consent, because it's

13

with his consent and induced.

14

way one would commonly read it.

15

to do that, all they had to do is put that under color of

16

official right, right at the beginning and put the other

17

at the ending, it would have been very clear.

18

And then

Likewise it seems to me that

Or under color -- what did it mean

3

if -- I mean you could, under your provision, it would

4

cover no more than what the threat of - - what the threat

5

language would take care of.

6

MR. ABBOTT:

You could make that argument.

The

7

course of extortion part says force, violence, or fear.

8

And what we say is it has to be a demand or a threat under

9

color of official right, which comports with the common

10

understanding of extortion.

11

under color of official right, in an extortion statute, if

12

they didn't intend to comport with the basic understanding

13

of extortion, will certainly remain a mystery, I think.

14

But I understand the point Your Honor is making.

15

QUESTION:

Why they would put that,

Well, it's hardly a mystery if they

16

intended to incorporate the old common law offense.

17

not a mystery at all.

18

MR. ABBOTT:

It's

It's plain as day.
I think it is a mystery, Your

19

Honor, if in fact they intended to equate -- you'd have to

believe, obviously Congress intended to equate passive

acceptance with violence, coercion or extortion

QUESTION:

Well, that's Congress' privilege, to

lump things together in concocting criminal offenses.

in doing so, they are also incorporating a new meaning of

extortion, a sense of extortion that we have not known

before.

So to that

Let me just very briefly come to count two,

simple and very brief, that count one and count two are

inextricably linked, that on count two the jury had to

that we believe that the focus of the charge was on the

MR. BRYSON:

Our position in this case is that the under

in effect, the old common law crime of official extortion,

10

which was taken directly from New York law, which in turn

had this crime of official extortion.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, if you're right on that,

13

why is a maximum 20-year penalty attached to this

14

particular offense, whereas at both the common law and in

15

New York law, as I understand it, it is a misdemeanor with

16

a very minor penalty?

17

MR. BRYSON:

Well, of course, at common law,

18

Your Honor, a misdemeanor didn't mean that -- what it now

19

means, which was that you would, in Federal law for

20

example, be subject only to a 1-year penalty, but it

21

rather meant that it was not a crime that was subject to

22

the death penalty, typically, and forfeiture of property.

It was a

9

number of cases.

And the number of crimes that were

How about under New York law?
Under New York law it was a

official extortion, but also coercive extortion, two

10

separate crimes, and put it into Federal law defining

11

those two crimes separately.

12

have to look to New York law and the common law that

13

undergirds New York law to determine what the scope of

this crime of extortion, that is, under color of official

money that you were not entitled to by your office.

21

I looked in McCormick,and I could not find

MR. BRYSON:

The only prosecution that we could

22

find under the official extortion branch of the New York

23

And the point of the Whaley case is found, I

think, not so much in its facts, as in what that court

But what's important, I think, about the way the

case is, to repeat, is that it adopts in haec verba the

common law formulation of official extortion, color of

right to the fee, but authority to perform official

services.

In other words, color of official right is not

13

policeman said, give me $50, and I'll let you open this

there was no assertion of entitlement to the $50 by virtue

But nonetheless, it was by virtue of his

authority, his claim of right, his use of his office, or

misuse of his office -- that was the basis for his

obtaining the $50, and that is consistent with everything

The crime that was created was the

crime of official extortion, and it covered a whole range

3

of official misconduct, including classic bribery conduct,

including conduct involving false representation, and

including coercive conduct.

for these examples is the Law Review article which we cite

The examples from the common law, one

There's this argument to be made,

the money.

13

Whereas that analogy doesn't hold if he

MR. BRYSON:

Well, actually I think the

14

analogy -- first of all I think that the way the common

15

law courts looked at this problem was to say that

16

someone's office itself has a very powerful potential

17

coercive effect, and the officer doesn't have to

18

underscore the matter by going out and soliciting.

19

think the analogy further breaks down because there are

20

coercive extortion cases in which the defendant is not the

21

person who puts someone at fear, the defendant, let's say

22

a mob boss, is not the person who either initiates the

fear or takes any sort of steps to put the person in fear.

There's a reason that

from dealing with this official.

And what I also know about New York law is that bribery

regarding this distinction between bribery and extortion

beyond just the definitional section that found its way

into the Hobbs Act.

5

There were three different pertinent sections of

New York law here.

First there was the definitional

section, which is almost identical to the section that

8

appears as the definition of extortion in the Hobbs Act.

Then there was another section which described extortion

10

by fear, that is to say coercive extortion.

Then there

was a section that separately set out the offense of

official extortion.

MR. BRYSON:

Well, the statute uses a term of

art, and our position is that term of art is not -- it has

8

to be read in light of its origins, which were in New York

law and the common law.

And its origins make quite clear

that we are talking about compensation in excess of that

which you are permitted.

QUESTION:

it has no limiting principle?

14

But you will admit that on its face

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think, yes, I think that

not answer the question of how broad the statute is.

gratuity as opposed to the taking of a bribe.

But we

3

think that the Hobbs Act does extend to certain kinds of

4

gratuities when the performance and the payment are linked

5

as closely as they would be in your hypothetical.

6

me give you a case that exemplifies why that is so.

7

Cuda case from the Seventh Circuit involved a case in

8

which a, I suppose it was a builder in Chicago sought a

10

alderman.

The alderman gave his permission, and then the

11

builder went back later and said how much do I owe you.

12

And the alderman said $1,500.

13

Now there was no prior understanding or

14

arrangement or whatnot, but that was deemed to be

15

extortion under color of official right because it was a

16

compensation for a specific official act.

MR. BRYSON:

That's right.

That isn't this

respect to a specific payment for a specific act, it would

include certain kinds of gratuities.

7

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question, just as

8

a matter of information?

If we disagreed with your

9

reading of the extortion statute, is there a provision of

10

the criminal code that covers the knowing acceptance of

11

money that the donor expects to be used to pay for a

12

legislative vote or something like that?

13

MR. BRYSON:

I would think you would have to go

14

to the Travel Act, which is the statute that governs

15

interstate travel or transportation, the use of interstate

16

facilities to effect a violation of State bribery or

17

extortion laws.

there was some - -

officials would be covered, but with respect to State

I mean, you just get

the person who receives it for the extortion, unlike the

10

bribery statutes which typically get both giver and

11

receiver.
MR. BRYSON:

12

That's right, although there's a

question, the question would be open as to whether you can

prosecute the donor under certain circumstances for aiding

MR. BRYSON:

Well, since -- well, there haven't

statute.

23

prosecutions were more common.
You found in those cases, as I mentioned before,

2

3

standard bribery-type conduct, but you always found only

4

the recipient, the official being prosecuted.

5

consistent with the traditional common law approach, which

6

is to say this is a crime committed by the official.

7

really a violation against public justice rather than any

8

form of property crime or any form of crime as to which

9

the payor would be separately liable.

And that is

It's

I think, if I may very briefly address the

10
11

question of the language of the statute, not the official

12

right, but the inducement feature, if you look at the 1934

13

act, it becomes even clearer, I think, than it is in the

14

1946 act, that induced, the induced clause, applies to the

15

coercive instruction portion of the statute, and not to

16

the under color of official right.

17

whoever obtains with his consent property, comma, induced

18

by fear or force, comma, or under color of official right.

19

In other words, it makes the -- there's less language in

20

the coercive induced section, and therefore it's clearer

21

that the induced relates to force or fear and not to color

22

of official right.

23

The 1934 statute says,

And that is consistent with the common law

concept of obtaining property under color of official

right.
