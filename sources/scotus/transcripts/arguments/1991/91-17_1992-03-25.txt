ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD N. FRISCHHERTZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At issue in the Cowart case is the statutory

11
12

construction of section 33(g), sections 1 and 2, of the

13

Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as amended

14

in 1984.

15

Cowart's entitlement to additional compensation, or what

16

is called deficiency compensation, is terminated because

17

he failed to obtain written permission from his employer,

18

Nicklos Drilling, prior to the settlement of a third party

19

claim.

20

The question presented to this Court is whether

The Court is presented with four separate issues

21

to decide in resolving the Cowart case.

22

the meaning of a person entitled to compensation under

23

section 33.

24

is under an order of compensation or a person who has

25

been, who is receiving compensation.

One is what is

It has been interpreted to mean a person who

-s,

The second issue would be what are the effects

1
2

of the 1984 amendments to the Longshore and Harbor

3

Workers' Compensation Act with reference to section

4

33(g)(2), which added a notice provision.

5

The third issue would be whether, pursuant to

6

the authority of the Sellman decision from the Fourth

7

Circuit, when an employer participates in the settlement

8

process of the third party settlement, does that relieve

9

the employee of obtaining written permission.

10

And fourthly, the question would be whether Mr.

11

Cowart's settlement was in fact for an amount less than

12

compensation to which he was entitled to.

13
14

favor of Mr. Cowart, would then have to reverse the Fifth

15

Circuit.

16

We can make short work of this case if we are to

17

apply the holding of Sellman in this particular case.

18

can avoid - -

Frischhertz?
MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

That's the Fourth Circuit case

that I attached to my Reply Brief.

obviate the necessity of a very intensive discussion of

24

what the '84 amendments meant and what the legislative

25

history intended with regard to the application of 33(g).

That case could

1

'The Sellman decision simply stated that when the employer

2

participates in the settlement process 33(g) is not

3

triggered, meaning there is no necessity for the written

4

permission.

5

This is a different concept than the estoppel

6

concept that was addressed in the 1972 amendments.

7

Court in Sellman simply says 33(g) is inapplicable to the

8

application of 33 (f) .

9

The

The Court really doesn't go far enough, because

10

if we resort to the simple plain language of the statute

11

with regard to whether permission is required of an

12

employer, all we need look at is the language of the

13

statute.

14

entitled to compensation enters into a settlement with a

15

third person, when we have an employer such as Nicklos

16

Drilling who not only waived subrogation, had an

17

indemnification provision, had a provision to defend the

18

third party, actually funded the settlement, how can that

19

be construed to be a settlement with a third person?
QUESTION:

20
21

The language of the statute states if the person

Very easily.

That's who the

settlement was with.
MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

22

The settlement is of a third

23

party settlement, but the settlement was with Nicklos

24

Drilling.

25

They funded it.
QUESTION:

That doesn't mean it's with them.

^

wS

That's my argument to the

2

Court, and I buttress that with the provisions of section

3

8(i) of the act which provides that an employee's

4

termination of compensation can only be effected with a

5

settlement that is submitted to the deputy commissioner

6

and is approved by the deputy commissioner.

7

settlement of his compensation claim with Nicklos.

8

was a settlement that circumvented the provisions of

9

section 8(i) of the act that specifically reserves to the

10

deputy commissioner the right to scrutinize the settlement

11

to determine whether there is adequate compensation.

Circuit, through its interpretation of 33(g), has held

that it's a settlement of his compensation because it

terminated his rights under section 33(f) for additional

21

compensation, for future compensation.

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

as Sellman said, a situation where the employer is not

participating in the settlement.

Now this is in conflict with the Fifth Circuit

holding.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Frischhertz, what do you

12

make of the language in the last clause of section

13

933(g)(2), which says that benefits are forfeited

14

regardless of whether the employer or the employer's

15

insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitlement to

16

benefits under this chapter?

17

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

That goes to the

18

interpretation of what a person entitled to comp is and

19

what the meaning of the amendments are.

20

that is submitted is the same interpretation that the

21

Benefits Review Board held in Kahny, in Dorsey, in Pinell.

22

That interpretation is that Congress in 1984 reenacted

23

word for word section 33(g)(1), which mirrors the prior

24

33(g).

25

My interpretation

That interpretation was first gave meaning in

1

O'Leary, the O'Leary decision, which held that a person

2

entitled to compensation is merely, is solely a person who

3

is either under an order of compensation or who is

4

currently receiving compensation.

5

for word 33(g) that had been given the interpretation by

6

the Benefits Review Board and by the Ninth Circuit in the

7

unpublished O'Leary decision and by the Kahny decision in

8

a unpublished Fifth Circuit decision that does have

9

precedential value.

10

Congress reenacted word

The additional provision of section 33(g)(2)

11

applies to employee, and in fact if you read the language

12

in 33(g)(1) the language is a person entitled to

13

compensation.

14

and says an employee, and it says if no written approval

15

of the settlement is obtained and filed as required by

16

paragraph (1), the pre-84 statute, or if the employee

17

fails to notify the employer of any settlement obtained

18

from or judgment rendered against a third person, all

19

rights to the compensation, medical benefits under this

20

chapter shall be terminated, and then the language you're

21

concerned with is regardless of whether the employer or

22

the employer's insurer has made payments or acknowledged

23

entitlement to benefits under this chapter.

24
25

The language in 33(g)(2) deviates from that

That section relates to employees, which is a
class that covers all injured employees.

What I submit to the Court is what Congress did

10

was in section (1) adopt the statute as it was understood

11

to mean through a long string of cases, of BRB cases,

12

which was the * understanding and the position of the

13

Director of what the meaning was, and Congress was very

14

fearful and they stated in legislative history of these

15

quiet, secret settlements where no notice is offered to

16

the employer.

17

So the employer may be refusing to pay

18

compensation, but he still has his subrogation rights.

19

still has his credit rights.

20

He can only enforce them if he has notice.

specifically a concern of Congress, and Congress enacted

this provision to protect the employer from that specific

situation.

clause of sub (2), which refers specifically to written

approval of settlement obtained as required in (1)?

3

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

That's correct.

My, the

4

interpretation that I submit to the Court is that

5

regardless clause refers to employees who fail to notify.

6

Section (2) is reiterating in that first statement, if no

written approval of the settlement is obtained as filed,

required by paragraph (1).

approval is obtained as stated in (1), or the disjunctive.

It's referencing if no written

1

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

It's interesting -- of course

2

we have acknowledged that deference is to be given to the

3

Director when they have an interpretation that is not

4

inconsistent with the clear language of the statute.

5

was my belief that they had such an interpretation before

6

the Fifth Circuit.

Longshore Procedural Manual, that they, that I attached,

8

the provision I attached to my Reply Brief clearly states

9

what their position was back in '86, and they stated

It

It was my belief that they, in the

10

clearly that their interpretation was a person entitled to

11

comp meant someone 'who was receiving compensation or who

12

was under an order.

13

Now there is a very lengthy legislative history

14

that lends to that interpretation, and in fact it is

15

discussed quite extensively by this Court in Bloomer, and

16

it goes through the interpretation, the historical

17

interpretation of how that came about.

18

interpretation starts in '27.

The historical

But getting back to the question as to what do

20

we do with the Director's position who since 1977 has

21

followed O'Leary, who has appeared in all of these cases,

22

filed briefs even in the Sellman case, even in the Barger

23

case that was consolidated with this case before the Fifth

24

Circuit, and now appears here with a different position,

control the decision making process -QUESTION:

3

I just want to know whether there's

4

anything left for us to defer to, regardless of what's in

5

the mind of the hierarchy.

6

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

The only thing I suggest is

7

there are cases that I cite in the Reply Brief that

8

suggest that when an administrative body changes a long-

9

10

don't give that new position the deference, but if any

Well, what do we do about the old

We don't have that to defer to anymore either.
MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

Well, I think you can

15

interpret the cases I cited to say that.

I don't think we

16

have to even rely on the deference issue.

I think we can

17

take and look to what Congress intended.

21

and amend the act to overrule O'Leary, that that will have

22

an effect on the current entitlement to hundreds of

23

thousands of workers who settled their cases based on

24

O'Leary, based on what the deputy commissioners told them.

Section 39 of the act says the deputy

MR. FRISCHHERTZ:

I, my interpretation is that

when you have a person receiving compensation under an

order under section (1) you need written permission.

19

Under section (2) if you are not receiving compensation

is notice, because it says you can either obtain written

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. LEE LEWIS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. LEWIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1985 when the suit was filed in Federal court

16

in New Orleans by the claimant I had two problems I was

17

facing on behalf of my client, Nicklos Drilling Company,

18

and its insurer.

19

our compensation liability to the claimant who was

20

unemployed.

21

indemnity claim brought against us by Transeo Exploration

22

Company, the third party which the claimant had sued in

23

Federal court in New Orleans.

24

harmless that ran in their favor with respect to claims

25

brought by our employees.

Number one was, of course, that we had

Number two, we were looking at a contractual

And they had a hold

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

I thought I saw a way to resolve both of those

2

problems with one fell swoop, and that was by negotiating

3

and funding through Transeo a third-party settlement of

4

Mr. Cowart's claim arising out of his injury that he

5

sustained in 1983, and thereby not only concluding our

6

problems with Transeo, but also closing thfe books on the

7

Department of Labor's case with respect to Mr. Cowart.

8

And I looked at 933(g) and I sure thought that told me

9

that I could do exactly what I wanted to do.

10

And of course this wasn't the only case in which

11

this had been done.

This has been a practice for many

12

years for employers to conclude their liability through

13

contributing to third-party settlements, through taking

14

the benefits of third-party settlements, and it seems to

15

me evident that the Congress has always recognized, and

16

33(g) is intended to recognize, that lump sum settlements

17

of tort claims against third parties constitute an

18

acceptable manner of providing compensation for injured

19

workers in lieu of the workers' compensation scheme where

20

those remedies are available.

21

QUESTION:

Let me just ask to be sure I get the

22

facts in my -- at the time of your settlement negotiations

23

where you killed the two birds with one stone in effect,

24

did you, you were then not paying compensation?

25

MR. LEWIS:

Literally we were not paying -- or,

You were not.

10

MR. LEWIS:

It was our position at that time

that he was a person entitled to compensation.

QUESTION:

Correct.
We resisted it, frankly, primarily

because we wanted to make the third-party settlement over

Transeo and close this whole thing out without having to

15

deal with the Department of Labor.

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that you had an

inconsistence in your position there, that you were

treating him as a person not entitled to compensation for

purposes of your negotiations with him, but once you made

your settlement with the, with Transeo he suddenly

21

developed into a person entitled to compensation and

state our position was that it was our view that he was a

before the administrative law judge in this case in April

2

of 1986.

3

If we look at the circular promulgated by the

4

Director of the OWCP and the procedures manual which sets

5

out this interpretation of the phrase person entitled to

6

compensation we see it's dated May 14, 1986.

7

of the Fifth Circuit in the Collier case, the one upon

8

which we relied, was March 10, 1986, 2 months before the

language, that the wording which Congress used in 33(g)(1)

made it clear that whether it's a matter of deference or

MR. LEWIS:

Yes, Your Honor.
Yes.
I think as I read the Fifth

made for less than the amount of compensation

19

QUESTION:

And yet at the time that those

actions were resolved the Federal, the Department was

21

taking a different view, was taking the petitioner's view

and were allowing these additional benefits.

My thinking on that is 'those people are not

10
11

persons entitled to compensation because they are not yet

12

disabled, and the definition of qualification for benefits

13

under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Act is disability

14

or death resulting from injury.

15

QUESTION:

If we accepted your interpretation

16

and benefits were stripped from claimants who relied on

17

the prior agency interpretation, could Congress then go

18

back and amend the statute and restore those benefits?

19

MR. LEWIS:

I suppose the Congress could do

20

that.

21

has its inception in May of 1986.

22

the Fifth Circuit, which is totally contrary to that

23

interpretation, preceded that by 2 months.

the interpretation the Director has brought forth was

25

conceived for the purpose of contesting the Fifth

I think that the interpretation here, as I said,

I think that

Circuit's view on this matter in the hopes of, as it did

2

in this case, attempting to persuade the Fifth Circuit to

3

change its mind, either in a second approach to the case

4

or in a rehearing en banc, or in ultimately bringing it

5

before this Court.

6

I think that that administrative interpretation

7

was a reaction to the Fifth Circuit's decision in Collier,

8

and this case is the vehicle that it hopes to undo it.

9

don't think the longstanding interpretation that is 2

10

months younger than the Fifth Circuit's original Collier

11

decision is entitled to deference from this Court.

QUESTION:

Well, we could also reach the same

13

result by refusing to extend it before the enactment of

the revised 933(g) which included the subsection (2) for

the first time, and that was 1984.

preventing retroactivity is certainly available, isn't it?

interpretation of it, I don't see that 33(g) has any

different import now than it did --

QUESTION:

Don't you think (2) makes it clearer

than it was without (2)?
MR. LEWIS:

ambiguity as to determining how and in what manner the

that we're making here today is that the claim in clear

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't know what the respondent's

22

position is on cases that have gone to judgment, but our

23

position is that those cases are governed by res judicata.

The cases that have been alluded to in

occupational disease cases in which employees have been
exposed to asbestos or other disabling materials on the
work place and have sought both third-party recoveries and
compensation.

In a lot of those cases the third-party

claims have gone forward while the compensation
proceedings have been stayed, and many of those have been
settled by the employees.
Our position, I think it does coincide with what
the private respondents said about that, many of those
employees will not have been disabled at the time they
reach their third-party settlement, and for that reason in
our view are not persons entitled to compensation under
the statute.

So those people will also not be affected by

the Court's ruling today.
In addition, we think that there are settlements
that will not be for more than the compensation, that will
be for more than the compensation due in the gross amount
and less for the, than the compensation due in the net
amount.

Those settlements also will not be affected.
So the long and short of it is there are many

individual factual questions that apply in the so-called
thousands of cases that have arisen, and it has been the
Director's position that those cases should be held
pending this Court's decision, and then they should be

MR. DREEBEN:

You think

I think it's a closer question,

10

Justice Scalia, as to what the statute clearly meant prior

11

to the 1984 amendments, and we would have no disagreement

if this Court concluded that pre-1984 the Director's

think in fact the coverage of the term person entitled to

compensation was pretty clearly more broad than the

3

position that the Director had taken prior to 1984, but I

4

would not disagree with a reading of the statute that said

5

before 1984 there may be some room for ambiguity.

6

there certainly is no room for ambiguity after 1984.

That, I think that's a possible distinction even though

there is evidence that person entitled to compensation was

broader before.

In fact if you took employee completely

2

literally in section (g)(2) it would mean that if a

3

survivor obtained a judgment for more than the amount of

4

compensation the survivor would not even have to give

5

notice to the employee, the employer, and that would make

6

no sense because then the employer would be entirely

7

deprived of notice of a judgment that would extinguish its

8

compensation liability.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, is it, number one,

10

possible or does it happen with any frequency that there

11

are more than one third person, there will be maybe a

12

principal third person who has a potential for liability

13

but some very collateral third persons that might make

14

small settlements?

15

Does that ever, does that occur?

MR. DREEBEN:

It happens most often, Justice

16

Kennedy, in the occupational disease context where in fact

17

an employee might work for several different employers and

18

be exposed to asbestos or coal dust over a number of years

1

and therefore have a number of potential defendants all of

20

whom might be liable for causing part of the injury.

21

QUESTION:

And so settlement with any one of

22

those third persons would, under your view, preclude, the

23

unauthorized settlement would preclude obtaining benefits

24

from any employer?

entitled to compensation at the time he makes the

2

disabled.

4

is disabled and unable to work, and in our view

5

settlements by a person in that position are not covered

6

by the approval requirement in (g)(2).

8

A lot of these cases arise before the employee

QUESTION:

Because the person is not entitled to

9

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

Until you're

11

that would entitle you to receive compensation if you went

12

ahead and applied for it.

13

think that means that you are not entitled to compensation

at that time.

the person entitled to compensation, and if you use your

theory that you're not a person entitled to compensation

the disability shows up it seems to me he could keep that

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, he eventually becomes a

exempt a person who is actually entitled to compensation

from the credit rules of this section.
