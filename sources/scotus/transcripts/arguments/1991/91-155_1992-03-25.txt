ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS/CROSS-RESPONDENTS
MR. FISHER:

12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Born at the onset of the Seventies and by the

13

early Eighties the subject of an unusual consensus of 30-

14

plus cases, now in the Nineties the issue presented today

15

of airport crossroads as commerce and idea marketplaces

16

may well serve to shape the future of the public forum as

17

we not long from now end this and enter the next century.

18

And it's from the vantage point today of what so

19

many cases, including six circuits, the Canadian supreme

20

court, findings of Congress and the FAA with its special

21

knowledge and airport expertise, almost 20 years of time,

22

place, and manner regulations that have been tailored by

23

airports throughout the country to ensure and protect the

24

free and unburdened passenger flow at airports, also today

Free Congress Foundation and Concerned Women for America,

2

and also unlike perhaps any case in recent times, a kind

3

of special judicial notice because everyone in the

4

courtroom has probably witnessed what's at issue here.

5

Indeed, Your Honors,

from the Ninth Circuit's

6

Kuszynski -- the '73 case, not the judge -- to the

7

present, no kind of forum has been the subject of so much

8

analysis covering so many facets, and it's from this

9

vantage point that we present this case today which began

10

17 years ago with, a very fast track start of a TRO hearing

11

within less than an hour of filing the case that I had

12

with my colleague here, Mr. Berg.

13

But soon the case took a slow track nose dive,

14

and the first 13 years of the case --

15

solely on the airline leased terminals as opposed to the

16

Port Authority unleased general circulation areas, which

17

the Port Authority months before we filed the case, months

18

before we talked about the case,

19

regulations excluding ISKCON, and the Port Authority

20

agreed to ISKCON's very limited presence and subject to

21

detailed Port Authority tailored time, place, and manner

22

regulations, and these regulations were altered over the

23

ensuing 13 years as the Port Authority saw its needs

24

increase, and I want to give an example.

beaten-track area in the mezzanine area of the

3

international arrivals building.

the stained glass chapel that holds regular Catholic,

5

Protestant, and Jewish services.

6

It's in the vicinity of

Now, during the first 13 years of the case the

7

Port Authority neither disputed that those areas that' they

8

allowed ISKCON to be in were public fora nor did they

9

complain about the agreement, and the airport deputy

10

director, Mr. Sloane, testified in his deposition in 1985

11

that the arrangement with ISKCON worked out okay.

12

But Your Honors, in 1988, ISKCON settled with

13

all the airlines.

14

in every airline from Aeroflot to Zambia Air, but we

15

settled with all of the airlines and the Port Authority

16

standing alone for the first time in the history of this

17

case and perhaps inspired by Jews for Jesus that not long

18

ago at that point expressly left the public forum issue

19

open, in 1988 for the first time in this case the Port

20

Authority put the nonleased areas at issue when it

21

declared at a summary judgment proceeding --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FISHER:

You're not arguing that -I'm not arguing that point, and the

10

reason I'm presenting this is that I think that it's

11

important for the actual factual context of this case and

12

the importance or nonimportance of facts that are now

13

being argued to the Court be put in perspective as to what

14

this case is about, so I think it is important for the

15

Court to understand this, and I'll just spend another

16

minute or two on it.

17

But at the summary judgment hearing it was

18

announced for the first time that a regulation had just

19

been promulgated banning ISKCON's literature distribution

20

and solicitations, but Your Honors, at that summary

21

judgment hearing which was held 4 years ago today on

22

March 25, 1988, Mr. Berg at Joint Appendix 496 underscored

23

that the ban was based on purpose characterization, a

24

legal presentation, and not anything to do with ISKCON's

25

conduct, and that if the Court did in fact determine that

1

the areas in question were public fora, then as far as he

2

was concerned and the Court Authority was concerned, and

3

he said, we don't object to the present arrangement that's

4

been made.

5

Now, for the first time in this case the briefs

6

here say that if it is a forum it can still be excluded.

7

Now, the Port Authority enacted this regulation, announced

8

that day, behind closed doors without any record, without

9

any hearing, except a preamble, and that makes clear that

10

it was directed at ISKCON's scripture ministry which

11

consists of religious book distribution and solicitations

12

from book-takers of a printing cost-defraying donation

13

without which their ministry would be crippled.

14

Now, the regulations preamble singles out ISKCON

15

in a way that is not so different from the way that the

16

Moonies were singled out in the law that was struck down

17

in Larson v. Valente and the laws we cite in our reply

18

brief in the 1880's that were tailored to exclude the

19

Salvation Army from their particular mode of expression.

20

Now, as I've said, the petitioners have

21

continued their activity at the airports during the last 4

22

years, as they have for the 13-plus years before, pending

23

review of this law that categorically bans their

24

literature distribution and solicitations in the terminals

25

if done for any length of time, no matter how innocuously

conducted, but the regulation does recognize that the

2

terminals are fora for and does permit continuous

3

preaching, but not 1 Timothy 5, and it allows repetitive

4

singing, but not the praises of solicitations.

QUESTION:

MR. FISHER:

QUESTION:

Mr. Fisher -Yes, Your Honor.
Would you conceive that the airport

could limit access to only ticketed passengers?

Yes, Your Honor, and in fact the -And it did so rather recently in many

areas - -

MR. FISHER:

QUESTION:

14

MR. FISHER:

In Desert Storm.
Did it not?

Yes.

Yes, and that wasn't the first time

15

that that happened.

16

have been storms, there have been wars, there have been a

17

number of instances where all or part of the airports have

18

been restricted to ticketed passengers.

19

QUESTION:

Over the 17 years of this case there

Do you think that that conceded

20

ability of the airport to limit access bears on our forum

21

analysis in any way?

22

MR. FISHER:

Not on the question of whether the

23

airport is a forum or not.

24

what time, place, and manner regulations would be

25

appropriate, and in fact I mentioned airports throughout

It bears on the question of

4

QUESTION:

Well, I would have thought that it

5

had some relationship to the analysis in Kokinda, for

6

example, and I just wondered how you would characterize

7

that.
MR. FISHER:

8

9

I don't think that the question,

again, of whether the airport is a forum which can be

10

subject to time, place, and manner regulation as it has

11

been for these 17 years is answered by the question of

12

whether, in an emergency or some catastrophe or whatever,

13

areas in addition to areas that normally would be no

14

problem for passenger flow or whatever, whether those

15

areas also could be closed at that time.

16

I don't think that answers the question in and

17

of itself, the fact that at some points it could be

18

closed.

19

be closed at certain times, but that doesn't answer the

20

question as to whether they are classic public fora.

I was commenting on this regulation of what it
allows and doesn't allow.
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

You would say that if an airport

24

permanently permitted only ticketed passengers that you

25

would think that was invalid.

MR. FISHER:

manner, I suppose, but the -- you know, we might come back

13

to a Court such as this, if that were the case, and argue

14

that it didn't make any sense whatsoever and challenge it

15

under the Court's jurisprudence regarding time, place, and

manner regulations, and say that that isn't the time,

can close streets.

MR. FISHER:

Well -- all I meant by that was

10

that it would be subject to time, place, and manner

21

that they can't because it's a -- what we do is look at

the way a thing exists and decide whether it's a public

forum, not say in advance it's a public forum and

therefore it has to exist in a certain way.

MR. FISHER:

Well, that obviously is true, that

this has never happened.

of time.

It's happened for short periods

We are talking theoretically, and I guess I

7
8

could envision some airport that wanted to do that, and

9

let me just say that over the years of this litigation

10

where airports decided to cldse off -- I mean, it wasn't

11

always that ticketed passengers at some airports couldn't

12

go beyond a security check, but now in some places they do

13

that, and generally ISKCON has respected that and not

14

challenged that proposition.
If it wasn't open to the general public beyond

15
16

the security check area, then they sought the general

17

circulation areas where the general public was allowed.

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything that --

QUESTION:

Let me rephrase my question, since

you apparently didn't understand at first.

I'm sorry.

Are there people who go out to the airport who

4

are not either meeting planes or to greet someone or send

5

someone off on a plane or to get on a plane themselves or

6

to get off a plane themselves?

MR. FISHER:

There are

was your answer based on that you gave me just now if it

wasn't on a district court finding?

MR. FISHER:

There are materials in our brief

that set out statistics regarding the nature and interest

of the people that go to the airports, and it's a wide

was no, that nobody went out there who was not either
going out to get a plane or meet somebody, but that they

did other things while they were there?

In other words, obviously they don't have to go

your position be just as strong or just as weak, as the

case may be, if the answer were nobody went out there

a public forum either exists or doesn't exist depending

MR. FISHER:

Is it your theory of the case that

There would be the argument

discussed before that even if arbitrarily and suddenly

they decided to close the airport to the nonticketed

The fact here is that these airports and

MR. FISHER:

The cases that, we rely on for the

proposition that the airports as a general proposition

throughout the country, like streets and parks, are

5

thoroughfares and sidewalks and the same sort of

6

enterprise of Government that provides a place for

7

commerce and ideas to be disseminated is the public street

that is not so well developed.

10

There are not so many

cases that define the public forum.
You have a first case of Hague v. CIO that makes

some comment about from time immemorial.

that we cited that go back to the last century.

MR. FISHER:

Well, the Salvation Army cases that

we came across from the 1880's, soon after the Salvation

Army came through Ellis Island to these shores, were cases

5

where the cities tried to exclude them and they weren't

terms of natural law or common law, and it's true, you

know, we have a history that we've shown in our brief of

the fact of this activity taking place, of the fact of

broadsides and pamphlets being distributed everywhere

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

virtually everyone who enters the terminal at Kennedy,

La Guardia, and Newark, does so for a purpose related to

air travel, and that was reflected in the decision by the

12

Second Circuit which is found at appendix 5 in the

13

Petition for a writ of cert.

Also, I'd like to make clear that the consistent

Port Authority policy has always been to oppose

16

solicitation and distribution of literature in the air

17

terminals.

made between counsel and was motivated on the part of the

19

Port Authority by a litigation strategy in order to avoid

the granting of a preliminary injunction which in our view

would have granted greater access to our facilities than

the agreement which we reached, and the agreement -- it

was always understood that the agreement was during the

colloquy is found at page 498 and 99 of the joint

3

appendix -- Mr. Lieberman, representing the Krishnas, said

4

that he just found out about the new regulation a few days

5

ago, but I don't really think it changes anything because

6

the port in their opposing papers made it very clear what

7

their policy was.
That is, that the airport terminals are a

suppose

it's a nonpublic forum, do the regulations still have to

MR. BERG:

I believe they do.

The regulations,

16

as I read this Court's decisions on nonpublic fora, they

17

must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.

QUESTION:

And in an airport that has a lot of

19

commercial activity and permits people to stand around and

20

visit and allows children to play, and petition signatures

to be gathered and one thing and another, do you think

it's reasonable to prohibit the passing out of literature

1

QUESTION:

And why?

2

MR. BERG:

Because our experience has shown that

3

this type of activity solicitation and distribution of

4

literature is inconsistent with the air travel purpose to

5

which the airports are devoted.

6

QUESTION:

Well now, how can you say that

7

handing out a leaflet to someone who wants to accept it is

8

inconsistent with the other activities that the airport

9

has allowed, and hasn't this Court drawn a distinction in

10
11

part for solicitation, which requires much more?
MR. BERG:

This Court has drawn such a

12

distinction, and I agree that solicitation is more

13

disruptive and that solicitation also has other problems

14

attached to it such as it's conducive to fraud, but I also

15

believe that distribution of literature is also disruptive

16

and that it would be reasonable to prohibit such activity.

17

It has many of the same attributes that solicitation does.

18

It still interferes, creates congestion, delay, interferes

19

with people's passage.

QUESTION:

Well, does it bother you if you say

21

no thanks, and keep walking?

22

MR. BERG:

I mean, I don't understand.

Presumably with a solicitor you could

also say no, I'm not interested, and keep walking, but the

The issue, I believe, is where this

type of activity is appropriate.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Berg, are you sure you want to

10

concede that the First Amendment requires that even in

11

12

reasonable, it's sort of an overarching reasonableness

requirement for all areas that are at all publicly owned

MR. BERG:

2

It has also said that it need not be

the most reasonable nor the only reasonable, and I think

there is a low level of scrutiny in a nonpublic forum.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Berg, doesn't reasonable mean you

6

have to be judged in some kind of a functional term, and

7

doesn't that prevent there being any kind of a blanket

8

rule, necessarily, for all airports?
If the Government constructed a comparatively

9
10

small airport in the City of Washington and said we're_

11

sick and tired of having all of the designer shops and the

12

crowd that they attract, we're going to have nothing but

13

plain, narrow corridors leading from a front door to the

14

place where you get on the plane, wouldn't the question of

15

reasonable regulation, and wouldn't the question of

16

whether a public forum had been created or not be affected

17

by simply the physical characteristics and the capacities

18

of the airport as distinguished from the kind of airports

19

that we're talking about here, in which there is an

20

apparent desire to, or a compatibility with attracting

21

crowds for something other than just getting on and off

22

planes?

In other words isn't there a functional

component to this that forbids us to talk about airports

of functional capacity basis to begin with?

MR. BERG:

I believe that you have to look at

each individual case and look at the purpose of the

11

than our airport, you would have to look at that -QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that if an airport

12

is compatible with and has apparently been designed for

13

and used for the kind of functions that historically have

14

taken place in town centers, in courthouse squares, in

15

sidewalks and things like that, that the answer to the

16

question of whether a public forum had been created there

17

would be different from the answer in the case that I gave

in which a no-frills airport with narrow corridors had

been created?

20

Wouldn't the answer be different?

MR. BERG:

If an airport terminal was the

21

substitute for a public street, the answer would be

22

different, but the concessions at major airports are

designed for the people who are there for an air travel

purpose, not for the general public.

the characteristics of the particular airport it's the

2

intention of the Government that determines whether or not

it may be treated as a public forum?

do you mean the apparent functional capacity of what has

MR. BERG:

I mean the purpose to which the

property is dedicated.

QUESTION:

So that if the Government says we're

14

going to build an airport, we're going to have vast

15

expanses of meeting places, shops, stores, we're going to

have restaurants and invite the world in, but we're doing

this only for the ultimate purpose of facilitating air

traffic and nothing which is in our judgment incompatible

with that can be allowed, that would foreclose the

question whether there was a public forum or not.

then, between that case in which you don't allow the

Government fiat and the case that we've got before us?

MR. BERG:

In this case all the record evidence

supports the finding that the sole purpose of the air

to facilitate the safe, efficient, and convenient movement

7

of air travel.

So you rest in effect on the factual

findings as you understand them that the function of the

solicitation, is that the nub of it?

That is correct.

it's demonstrated that it's inconsistent and that such

airport are a captive audience --

Well, I think he disagrees with the

purpose of the facility,, which is uncontested in the

3

record and which was found by the Second Circuit -QUESTION:

4

Oh, he disagrees with more than that.

5

He says that an airport is a traditional public forum.

6

That is, whether you Want it to be exclusively for

7

travelers or not, it can't be exclusively for travelers.
He says it's like public streets.

like public parks.

He says it's

You cannot stop that from being a

That is correct.

It's the

5

Facts have to do with whether this is

you have chosen to make it that, and that it seems to me

is quite a separate question, and maybe we ought to

discuss the two separately.
MR. BERG:

11

There is no contention here, from

wasn't a contention, that this is a designated public

3

MR. BERG:

I don't believe there should be a

find that the air terminals are nonpublic fora and that

it's reasonable to prohibit solicitation and distribution

of literature.

QUESTION:

Is it reasonable for us to find that

solicitation at this airport causes a serious problem with
reference to the convenience of passengers and the
congestion of traffic?

13

MR. BERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Is that uncontested, in your view?

15

MR. BERG:

The Second Circuit made a finding

16

that solicitation would be even more of a problem here at

17

air terminals than it was on the sidewalk involved in the

18

Kokinda case.

19

QUESTION:

It made a finding.

20

MR. BERG:

They held that because of the nature

21

of air travel, with passengers going through the terminal

22

buildings, rushing to catch a plane or going to secure

23

ground transportation, carrying luggage, that it would be

24

more disruptive here than in Kokinda to allow

25

solicitation.

I think that this case is quite close to the

1
2

recent decision by this Court in Kokinda.

In fact, I

3

think Kokinda was a more difficult case than this case,

4

because in Kokinda the Government had to overcome the

5

strong presumption that any sidewalk was a public forum.

6

In the instant case, airport terminals, unlike

7

sidewalks, have not long been devoted to expressive

8

activity.

•9

holding that a postal sidewalk was not a public forum, the

10

court set forth a number of critical factors, all of which

11

are present in the instant case.

Significantly, in Kokinda, in the course of

First, this Court noted that the Government has

12

13

much greater flexibility in restricting First Amendment

14

activity when it is acting as the operator of a facility

15

rather than as a Government regulator.

16

case, as in Kokinda, the Port Authority is acting as the

17

operator of a facility rather than as a regulator.

18

Airports, like post offices, are intended to be operated

19

much like private businesses and be as self-supporting as

20

possible.

In the instant

A second critical factor in Kokinda, and also

21

22

present here, is the special purpose of the forum

23

involved.

24

Kokinda was constructed solely to assist postal patrons to

25

negotiate the space between the parking lot and the front

This Court noted that the sidewalk involved in

2

commerce and life of a neighborhood or city.
In the instant case, the sole purpose of the air

3
4

terminals is to facilitate air travel.

5

operator, the Port Authority has a legitimate, managerial

6

interest to preserve air terminals for their air travel

7

purpose.
A final, critical factor set forth in Kokinda

8

9

As an airport

which is also present here is the physical separation of

10

the airports from the surrounding community.

11

the postal sidewalk was held to be akin to the nonpublic

12

forums of the military -- the sidewalks of the military

13

base involved in Greer and distinguished from the public

14

forum sidewalks surrounding this Court involved in Grace.

15

QUESTION:

In Kokinda,

You allow solicitation and

16

distribution of literature on the sidewalks anyway, don't

17

you?

18

MR. BERG:

That is correct.

19

QUESTION:

So why isn't that enough, anyhow?

20

Why do we have to get into all the rest of the argument?

21

Isn't that a reasonable time, place, and manner

22

restriction?

23

MR. BERG:

We do make that argument in our brief

24

that even if it would be found to be a public forum that

25

our regulations are valid because they are narrowly

2

communication.

3

QUESTION:

I think you have the same opportunity

4

to collect from somebody carrying a lot of baggage at the

5

terminal in the street as you do once they get in to check

6

their baggage.

7

MR. BERG:

It gives exposure to those people if

8

they wish to contribute.

In the instant case even more

9

than in Kokinda the airports are an enclave clearly

10

separated from the surrounding community.

11

Kokinda decision is also significant for what it finds to

12

be noncontrolling factors.

13

QUESTION:

Would you help me on that separation

14

from the rest of the community?

15

I'm not sure I understand that.

16

MR. BERG:

I think the

Why is that relevant?

I think the separation is relevant

17

because people are clearly aware that they are entering a

18

different facility.

19

between city streets and the airport, so they're clearly

20

aware of -- the entrances and exits are clearly marked, so

21

they are aware that they have entered a different type of

22

facility, a special enclave.

5

QUESTION:

Would your argument be the same with

regard to railroad stations if they were publicly owned?
MR. BERG:

The railroad --a railroad station

6

would have many of the similarities of the airport, but

7

they also would have some differences.

8

would be the location, and there's a possibility that the

9

railroad terminal located in the center of the city might

11

One difference

be used for other purposes, other than rail travel.
In Kokinda, this Court set forth a number of

12

factors that it found to be noncontrolling, and those

13

factors are the principal factors relied upon by the

14

plaintiffs in the instant case.

15

public forum analysis isn't dictated by the mere physical

16

characteristics of the property.

QUESTION:

Mr. Berg, let's assume that the

literature.

7

passengers don't like it, it's annoying to them.

8

9

MR. BERG:

What is the reasonable basis?

Your
Is that

Well, the reasonable basis, Your

10

Honor, is that it causes delay, and causes congestion, and

11

that the passengers are a captive audience because they

12

must be in the terminal and they must take designated

13

routes in order to accomplish their air travel purpose.

14

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't those problems be

15

solved by restricting the solicitors to certain areas?

16

You wouldn't have to keep them out of the building

17

entirely, would you?

18

MR. BERG:

Well, as a practical matter, time,

19

place, and manner regulations are very difficult to

20

administer, and if it's a nonpublic forum, there is no

21

requirement that a regulation be narrowly tailored as long

22

as the regulation is reasonable.

of the New York area airports that the district court

The Port Authority, as is clear, allows

continuous solicitations of people to read and sign

And in fact this case was not ever - - was not

ever presented by the Port Authority as one dealing with

it did that none of the litigants asked to be done.

11

the court -- what the Second Circuit did, even though

nobody had argued this and there wasn't any evidence to

It's not even mentioned in the

The regulation that is the

have been the forum that has been the focus of this case

and the attention of the district court and the Second

Circuit in all of the briefs, Your Honor, until the Port

Authority's brief before this Court when they mentioned

11

sidewalks, a wholly inappropriate place for which there is

12

no evidentiary record to support, and again it's been the

13

forum of the interior, which is the place where people

14

finally come to realize that they have time, and that's

15

why the very profitable Airport Bloomingdale's and other

16

shops are there.

17

They're not there to serve passenger flow, but

18

they're there for economic reasons because they know when

19

people come to rest they have time, they wander around,

20

and they wander around to the area that the Hare Krishnas

21

are allowed to be there now.
