ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. WOODRUFF TURNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a statutory construction case revisiting

12

the preemption provisions of the ERISA statute.

13

is whether they preempt the application of State anti­

14

subrogation automobile insurance laws as applied directly

15

to self-funded employee welfare plans.

16

The issue

The courts of appeals have decided three cases

17

involving this exact question.

18

as to self-funded plans, whereas one, the Third Circuit

19

below, found no preemption.

20

have address nine cases involving essentially this

21

question of which seven have found preemption and two,

22

including the court below, found no preemption.

23

Two have found preemption

In all the courts of appeals

Now the section 514, the preemption provision of

24

the ERISA, contains a tripartite preemption provision.

25

First, there is the broad preemption clause that this

1

Court has had occasion to construe on a number of

2

occasions. Secondly, there is an insurance savings clause,

3

so called, which exempts from the general preemption

4

provision, the traditional State area of insurance

5

regulation.

6

Thirdly, there is the so-called deemer clause,

7

which indicates -- which is at issue here and this is the

8

first time that this Court has had the third provision,

9

the deemer clause, directly before it, although you had

10

occasion to analyze it rather thoroughly in considering

11

the savings clause in the case of Metropolitan Life

12

Insurance Company.

13

Now the broad preemption clause has been held to

14

be deliberately expansive, designed to establish a pension

15

plan regulation as exclusive a Federal concern.

16

are State laws which relate to an ERISA plan — that's the

17

statutory term — in that they affect the administration

18

of a plan or directly impact the provisions of a plan.

19

Now the courts of appeal have uniformly held

20

that State insurance laws prohibiting the subrogation of

21

automobile injury claims relate to ERISA insofar as they

22

are attempted to be applied to ERISA plans and they are

23

thus preempted unless saved by the insurance savings

24

clause.

relates to this plan, because it reaches right into the

2

plan as promulgated and removes a provision calling for

3

the plan to have the right of subrogation when the planned

4

beneficiary recovers against a third party tort feasor.
Now the insurance savings clause saves from

preemption State laws regulating insurance and in this

7

instance may protect —

QUESTION:

9

MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

10
11

Purporting to —
Pardon me?
Regulating — are you talking about

the deemer clause now or the insurance?
MR. TURNER:

12

No, the insurance clause.

I'm

13

going through first the broad preemption clause, then the

14

insurance clause which may protect an anti-subrogation

15

from preemption unless the deemer clause imposes its

16

limiting power upon the insurance savings clause.
Now the deemer clause is a limitation in turn

17
18

upon the insurance savings clause.

19

Metropolitan Life case this Court said that the deemer

20

clause modifies the insurance savings clause and so it

21

would appear from the plain language of the statute.
QUESTION:

22

In fact, in the

Well, the deemer clause uses the word

23

regulate.

It applies — you're not — an employee benefit

24

plan shall not deemed to be an insurance company for

25

purposes of any State law purporting to regulate insurance

1

companies.

2

Now, does that term need definition?
MR. TURNER:

Well, it goes on.

It's more than

3

just purporting to regulate.

It says purporting to

4

regulate insurance companies, insurance contracts, banks,

5

trust companies, et cetera.

6

the phrase needs particular definition.

7

know, the word purporting to is what the Third Circuit

8

ceased upon and suggested that the inclusion of the word

9

purporting in that statute amounted to the word

That's — I don't know that
Although, you

10

pretextually.

11

pretextual method, endeavored to regulate these plans.

12

Or the State had, through some back door or

I don't believe we need to go that far.

Indeed,

13

the briefs that have been filed in this Court by my

14

friends here do not attempt to defend that interpretation

15

as it was rendered in the Third Circuit, which I must say

16

was also the interpretation that the Sixth Circuit took in

17

the Northern Group case.

18

that would purport somehow implied a pretextual approach

19

which we don't think is justified by the — by the

20

language.

21

They both seemed to think that

The deemer clause does not necessarily have to

22

attack a pretextual expansion of State regulation but one

23

which goes beyond the regular historical exception of the

24

insurance industry as we have known it in the McCarran-

25

Ferguson Act and elsewhere.

Now, in Metropolitan Life this Court saved a

1
2

mandated benefits law as applied to an insured plan, but

3

noted that the same law would be preempted as to a self-

4

funded plan, and pointed out that while the Court

5

recognized that that placed some difference between self-

6

funded plans and insured plans, that that was a difference

7

that was inherent in the program established by Congress.

8
9

*

And in order to reach that analysis, the Court
analyzed the whole of section 314, the whole preemption

10

section, so that most of the courts of appeals have

11

followed the analysis set forth in the Metropolitan Life

12

case.

13

courts of appeals because after all, while it was not the

14

holding of Metropolitan Life, it was nonetheless an

15

integral of that Court — of your Court's analysis only 5

16

years ago, a unanimous Court.

17

And I think that would be careful approach for the

The Third Circuit, in addition to injecting a

18

pretextual concept, also injected some — another new

19

concept that isn't founded in the statute.

20

what was called the core ERISA concept to date used to say

21

that subrogation laws were not within the core ERISA

22

concerns and therefore the anti-subrogation laws would not

23

be dealt with by the deemer provision.

24
25

And that was

On the other hand, the Sixth Circuit, in
straying from the implications and analysis of

1

Metropolitan Life, injected a theory of balancing State

2

versus Federal interests.

3

grounded at all in the statute.

4

in looking at a particular State regulation, that there

5

should be a balancing as to the relative significance that

6

the State had in the matter had versus the Federal

7

Government.

The court indicated that

And here again that seemed to have no basis in

8
9

And that is, again, not

the act.

10

QUESTION:

Your position, Mr. Turner, then is

11

that all of the preemption doctrine could be pretty well

12

spelled out of the try -- of the language of the

13

tripartite preemption provision, the broad preemption

14

clause, the exception for the business of insurance and

15

then the deemer provision that says an employee benefit

16

plan shall not be deemed to be the business of insurance.

17

MR. TURNER:

Chief Justice, that's exactly our

18

view.

19

that it is a relatively convenient rule of decision.

20

-- as opposed to a core ERISA concept or something else,

21

it's not vague and imprecise or hard to define.

22

might be borderline case that arise but it seems to be a

23

more helpful rule to guide the planned administrators in

24

the lower courts.

25

And the happy — the happy import of that view is

trouble — what sense does it make — why is your client

being treated differently?

What is Congress trying to do

here?

MR. TURNER:

Congress -- and it took me a long

while to come to this view, indeed, after the briefs were

written.

me.

Goetz, the 1976 article by Brummond, and the 1973 note in

the Georgetown Law Review.

And I reread three articles that are cited in

Those are all cited.

And what those three articles did was describe,

19

each of them in their own different perspective, the

20

historical conditions that were existing at the time

21

Congress enacted ERISA in '74.

22

late 1960's and early '70's, these self-funded or

23

uninsured plans were growing in both number and size.

commissioners.

viewed them as something rather like insurance.

4

were trying to decide how to expand their regulatory turf

as it were.

6

They -- but the commissioners nonetheless

Two proposals were made.

So, they

One, model legislation

7

was proposed by the National Association of Insurance

8

Commissioners in 1964.

9

was never adopted in any State.

However, that model legislation
So, failing the

10

legislative route, the State sought judicial

11

determinations that self-funded plans were the equivalent

12

of insurance and were therefore within the purview of the

13

existing State regulations.

14

the Missouri State court system that illustrates this.

15

There was a Monsanto case in

Now, in 1974 when this pulling and tugging was

16

going on, the Congress enacts ERISA and it would appear

17

very logical if Congress had been aware of the efforts of

18

the State insurance commissioners to expand their

19

regulatory power to incorporate the health care — the

20

self-funded benefit plans.

21

And I would suggest that based on this — I

22

grant you, Your Honor, extrinsic evidence or historical

context that the deemer clause was intended to resolve

this question.

of the application of Federal law and ERISA rather than

encouraging the expansion of the State insurance

2

commissions' power in this manner.

3

Congress was willing to brook the extent of

State insurance regulation as it stood, but they in a

5

timely manner decided to resolve this question of what law

should regulate these new —

QUESTION:

— by saying that these entities

should not become subject to State insurance regulation

because they would be considered insurance companies.

MR. TURNER:

QUESTION:

It's very interesting.

I think it's

12

the brief of the State legislature or one of the State

13

organizations, recites precisely the same history and

14

comes to the opposite conclusion.

MR. TURNER:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that they

missed the point of the articles.

18

differing interpretation, perhaps depending on which line

19

you're trying to establish.

20

Honor says what was the sense of this, is it an

21

aberrational distinction or is it one that makes sense.

22

If it's been analyzed that way it seems Congress made a

23

decision and that they — and this decision furthermore is

24

consistent with the broad preemptive sweep of 514(a), the

1

pensions will be nationally regulated so there's a uniform

2

system.

3

QUESTION:

How do you deal with the other

4

argument that's kind of related to this that the second

5

clause -- I get the names mixed up — uses the word

6

person.

7

whereas the deemer clause says you shall not be deemed to

8

be an insurance company.

9

noninsured plan out of the term person and —

It doesn't use the word insurance company,

10

MR. TURNER:

11

QUESTION:

But it really doesn't take a

Well -— shall not relieve any person from

12

any law which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.

13

And we have a law which I guess everybody agrees does

14

regulate insurance, bankings, and securities.

15

from the preemption provision, your client would be a

16

person subject to that law.

17

MR. TURNER:

And apart

Yes, I don't know that the word

18

person is where to focus though on 1144(b)2(A), where it

19

says, nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to

20

exempt of relieve any person from any law of any State

21

which regulates insurance.

22

I think, Your Honor, they focus more on the

23

insurance word there and they say that somehow when you

24

get down into (b), into the so-called deemer clause, that

25

the words are not exactly congruent.

But if you read the

SUITE 400

1

third clause, it seems very possible to read it as broader

2

than the insurance savings clause, as if Congress said,

3

we're going to make this lid larger than the pot to make

4

sure that nothing escapes from the insurance savings

5

clause that shouldn't go out of it.

6
7
8
9

But I don't think the lack of congruity in
language means anything of significance.
QUESTION:

The --

It would, sir, if the status is being

subject to State regulation depended on your being an

10

insurance company, status as that kind of person, then you

11

don't become that kind of person just because you're an

12

ERISA fund.

13

MR. TURNER:

No, but you are an employee benefit

14

plan, which is the type of entity that my client is and

15

which is what is specifically — so that if it's a person

16

under (a) — it seems to me that type of person is what is

17

carved out.

18

QUESTION:

What is carver -- it cannot be called

19

an insurance company by reason of the deemer clause.

20

the question I have is whether one has to be -- a person

21

has to be an insurance company to be a person who is

22

obligated to obey State laws regulating insurance,

23

banking, or securities.

24

through my mind.

That's the question that runs

entity here, and I don't — I'm sorry, I'm just not much

help perhaps.

4

I don't — I can't take your point further.

QUESTION:

Well, my point is that the — your

client is a person, whether or not it is an insurance

company within the meaning of the deemer clause, and maybe

that's enough to answer the case.

Counsel, may I just ask — we've

11

received amicus briefs from people on the health care

12

professions cautioning that our decision in this case

might affect freedom of choice, chiropractors, et cetera.

14

Is -- will that necessarily be the case if we follow your

interpretation?

In this particular case, you don't,

would not survive as applied to self-funded plans and that

supply that under the national regulatory scheme.

the freedom of choice laws as so-called in the States

would be saved by the insurance savings clause, but they

may, as applied to self-funded plans, be preempted.

that, as I say, if there is to be — if that arises and

people are disturbed about it, they should — the answer

is to have Congress mandate benefits which in the health

QUESTION:

So

Mr. Shapiro, could I ask that you

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, Congress did not give

19

us — I should have said thank you, Mr. Chief Justice --

20

Congress did not elaborate in great detail on why in the

21

first place it excepted insurance regulation from the

22

scope of preemption, and that brought the plan itself

23

under — plans themselves outside the scope of the savings

24

clauses, as we argue.

25

But I believe that the explanation lies in the

1

combination of two factors.

2

recognition of State interests in the areas of traditional

3

insurance regulation, a recognition that's embodied in the

4

McCarran-Ferguson Act and which led to the enactment of

5

the savings clause.

6

One is the long standing

I think it was then realized, particularly as

7

the preemption clause was broadened out at conference,

8

although the deemer predates that, I think it was realized

9

that if the plans themselves would be subject to

10

regulation under this recognition of traditional State

11

power, that the purpose of preemption, both the original

12

narrow purpose of preemption and the broader purpose of

13

preemption as it emerged from conference would be severely

14

-- severely (inaudible).

15

So, I think the reason for this distinction is

16

that effort which is bewildering admittedly at times had

17

effort to preserve State power to regulate insurance

18

companies and insurance in traditional ways but not to

19

regulate plans directly through that device.

20

why I think the deemer clause is such an essential

21

complement to the saving clause.

22

And that's

The time that I have available I would like to

23

focus on an argument that -- that is made for the first

24

time in this Court by the respondent and by her amicus,

25

the National Conference of State Legislatures, in an

1

approach that is very different from the approach of the

2

court of appeals.

3

They argue that while the savings clause is a

4

broad reservation of State authority to regulate

5

insurance, the deemer clause is, in its turn, only a very

8

insurance as a business, a phrase that they do not exactly

9

define but which appears to govern such State laws as

10

requirements or perhaps premium levels.

12

The deemer clause in their view leaves very

broad authority to regulate benefit plans directly as a

result of the savings clause.

We submit that argument fails on every ground.

It fails because it's contradicted by the broad text of

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, you omitted two

11

important words when you quoted the statutes:

12

to regulate" which suggest to me that statutes which in

13

terms define the regulated entities as insurance

14

companies, insurance contracts, banks, and so forth.

15

what they're saying is if that's the manner of bringing

16

the person under State regulation, it just doesn't apply

17

to ERISA fund.

And

Does that stop an ERISA fund from being a person
within the meaning of the second clause?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there are two aspects to

21

your question, Your Honor.

22

purporting as such does not mean that the State has to

23

expressly deem someone to be an insurance company.

24

Purporting could be expressly or by implication.

25

dictionary is clear on that.

I think first the word

requires either a pretext, as the court below suggests, or

2

a specific announced purpose.

3

We think the fact that this State law deals with

4

insurance subrogation provisions is sufficient to satisfy

5

the word purporting.

6

Now, the second part of your question focuses -

MR. TURNER:

We don't think it adds anything.
You don't think it adds any meaning?
No, we don't think it -- in fact

13

the word purporting is also found in the statute in the

14

definition of a State, and the use of the word purporting

15

there I think is very similar to the use here.

16

the definition of the word State would add the meaning of

17

the preemption provision also contains the word purporting

18

in the same context that we claim it is here.

19

That is,

With respect to the word "person" that you focus

20

on in the savings clause, we believe that the question is

21

whether the deemer clause effectively takes this out of

22

the savings clause because this State law, the State law

23

that is at issue here, is a law which we submit does

24

regulate insurance contracts and, in doing so, deems a

25

plan to be an insurer.

Indeed, if the plan were not an insurer for

purposes of this law regulating insurance contracts, the

case would not fall within the savings clause at all.

4

other words, we believe the very factors that bring it

within the savings clause also bring it within the deemer

clause because the plan is effectively deemed by the State

7

law to be an insurer for the purposes of a law regulating

8

insurance contracts, telling insurers that they are not

allowed to put a subrogation provision in their contract.

10

If they do, they will be void.

as self-insured plans are concerned all of the regulatory

authority that was given back to them by the savings

clause.

17

savings and deemer clauses don't use symmetrical language.

every State law that affects an insurance company or

So, it can't be that

Indeed, as Justice O'Connor suggested in — in

And the

understanding of the term to regulate insurance is not

enough that a law happens to affect insurance generally or

therefore, a law that purports to regulate insurance

2

companies or insurance contracts must be a law that is

3

directed specifically at insurance companies or insurance

5

And the anti-subrogation provision, quite

6

clearly as I said, is not such a law.

7

interpretation is even stronger in the deemer clause as

8

Justice Stevens' question suggested, because it uses the

language "purport."

I think that

think seems to have a common understanding that it does it

And so far as administrative convenience is

concerned, virtually all self-insurers like petitioner

15

committee, they all included the savings clause.

16

them included the deemer clause, which is not surprising,

17

because there would have been no reason to think the

18

deemer clause was necessary to protect plans from those

19

types of laws, given the existing authority.

20

In 1973, while ERISA was under consideration,

the first State court decision going the other way was

decided.

The effect of that decision was to put the self-

that the deemer clause was directed at that type of State

legislation which would put self-insurers out of existence

The deemer clause suddenly

Now, the timing certainly suggests

10

and require all ERISA plans to comply with those types of

11

business regulation.

12

And there is more compelling evidence in the

13

evolution of the statute that's what Congress had in mind.

14

At the time the deemer clause was written, the basic

15

preemption clause was quite narrow.

fiduciary obligations, notice and disclosure requirements.

The deemer clause couldn't have been expected to

preempt more than the preemption clause.

19

at the time it was put in the statute, its language could

20

have been thought to preempt only those kinds of State

laws, the State laws addressed at fiduciary obligations

But the deemer clause just saves a lot

MR. ROTHFELD:

Just that

Well, I think --

Which is not -- that doesn't preempt

anything.

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

I'm using preemption as a

shorthand.

I mean, I think it has the effect of excluding

them from State regulation by — by providing that they

can't be treated as regulated entities under — under

State law

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I don't think that we

endorse all of language of the analysis used by the court

of appeals, but certainly we agree with their general —

general conclusion and their general approach which is

that one has to examine whether or not a State law falls

5

How would this statute have to read

to come within the deemer clause?

have to be narrower so it would simply have to say that

there shall be no subrogation of insurers in insurance

MR. ROTHFELD:

It — it -- it would

I think that —

Then — then it would be covered by

the deemer clause.
MR. ROTHFELD:

13

I think the statute providing

14

that insurance contracts could not contain subrogation

clauses would be — it would be a different kind of

16

statute.

17

Now, as I — let me draw —
QUESTION:

What — what about a more general

18

statute that doesn't just speak of whether such a

19

provision in the contract would be valid but it just says

insurance companies shall have no write of subrogation,

neither by contract nor at common law?

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

I think that if it is a statute

— again, and I return to the Pilot Life case which

interpreted the phrase regulate.

though it reaches insurance companies and insurance

obviously there is a distinction between the statute you

1
2

It's not clear that his hypothetical

statute would even apply in this case.
MR. ROTHFELD:

3

I think that's true, Justice

4

Stevens.

But whether or not a statute that in terms

5

regulated insurance contracts and went on to regulate in

6

subpart (b) some other thing, falls within the terms of

7

the deemer clause I think is beside the point here,

8

because this statute quite clearly doesn't in terms

9

regulate insurance contracts at all.

Although it

10

obviously has an effect on insurance contracts, that can't

11

be enough given the language that Congress chose for it to

12

regulate insurance contracts.

13

And in any event, as I was suggesting, I think

14

that Congress has in mind particular kinds of State

15

insurance regulations — those that are directed at the

16

business aspects of insurance, which I think is supported

17

both by the activity that led up to the creation of the

18

deemer clause and is supported by the only specific piece

19

of legislative history which addresses how it is Congress

20

wanted the entire package of preemption provisions to

21

operate which is explanation by Representative Dent, who

22

was the floor manager and principal sponsor for ERISA in

23

the House and a member of the committee that wrote the

deemer clause.

He explained that the deemer clause -- that they

That statute was directed only at

And as I suggested before, that's the only line

10

Congress rationally could have been trying to draw.

11

if no explanation in the policies of ERISA as to why

Congress possibly wanted — would have wanted to apply

13

different preemption rules to self-insured and to fully

It would create irrational distinctions from the

intended beneficiary of ERISA.

QUESTION:

No, I didn't want to interrupt your

MR. ROTHFELD:

8

Well, I think to finish with that

9

point, petitioner's reading would mean that whether or not

10

any particular plan was covered by State law would turn on

11

whether or not the plan had reached the stop-loss point.

12

It would mean that whether an individual claim was

governed by State law, it would turn on whether that claim

was submitted before or after the stop-loss point had been

reached.

Solicitor General is not present in language of the deemer

15

The deemer clause doesn't refer to the self-

provides benefits to plan participants through the

purchase of insurance or otherwise.

separately to mean everything, meant to distinguish

to what Mr. Shapiro said.

he acknowledges is a serious concern.

that is there is to be sweeping preemption, Federal courts

would have no choice but to step in.

The Solicitor General does have

His solution is to

And we certainly agree

But that obviously would create enormous

10

problems of precisely this sort that petitioner is trying

11

to avoid.

12

would make it impossible for plans and plan participants

13

to gauge their obligations if those obligations are set in

14

the course of litigation on a case-by-case basis according

15

to an inchoate and evolving body of Federal common law.

16

The inevitable result would be increased litigation and

inconsistency, and this Court would of course be called

MR. ROTHFELD:

In fact, they would be worse than

to interpret a statute but to invent a new Federal common

together, a problem of more general State health and
medical insurance regulations as applied to self-insurers.
I would hypothesize that, but again there is no clear
evidence of what Congress was thinking when it wrote that.
QUESTION:

I think it makes more sense --

MR. ROTHFELD:

One — one final point that if

the court — if the Federal courts ever were forced into
the position of developing a Federal common law, by far
the most sensible thing for them to do would simply be to
borrow State rules of decisions, which is something that
is done in other analogous areas, but that of course would
make the entire strained exercise of finding preemption
entirely unnecessary.

But there is, fortunately, no need

to do that because there is no evidence whatsoever
anywhere that Congress had the intent to create the broad
preemption contended for by petitioner and the Solicitor
General.
Mr. Turner alluded to the breadth of the
preemption provision, but this case concededly falls
within the savings exception and, therefore, all the
comments about the breadth of the preemption provision
simple fall out of the case.
Here the focus must be the language and purpose
of the deemer clause.

Their reading
