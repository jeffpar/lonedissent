CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Foster.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. FOSTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FOSTER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on the State of California's

11
12

Petition for Certiorari to the California Court of

13

Appeals, Fourth Appellate District, Division 3.

14

California contends that the lower appellate court erred

15

when it ordered the illegal drugs found in the trunk of

16

Mr. Acevedo's car suppressed, because the officers had too

17

much probable cause.

18

probable cause as to the paper bag containing the drugs,

19

rather than unparticularized probable cause to the entire

20

vehicle.

21

voluntarily and intentionally placed the bag into the

22

trunk of the car, it attained the same degree of mobility

23

as the car, and by being in the car, it was subject to the

24

lesser expectation of privacy that surrounds a vehicle and

25

its contents.

That is, they had particularized

The State contends that when Mr. Acevedo

What I'd like to do this morning is briefly go

1
2

through the facts with you, and then explain why we

3

believe this Court's decisions in Carroll, Ross, and

4

Carney should be held to control in this case.

5

this Court should rule that the decisions in Chadwick and

6

Sanders have been limited by the subsequent decisions of

7

this Court.

We believe

8

The facts are not in any dispute in this case.

9

Back in 1987 Federal drug agents in Hawaii intercepted a

10

shipment of drugs bound for the mainland, nine bags —

11

nine kilo bags of marijuana.

12

police department, allowed the drugs to proceed to the

13

Federal Express office, and the local police officers

14

arranged a controlled delivery.

15

back to Mr. Daza's apartment.

16

Daza came out and threw away the outer wrapping material

17

and the inner wrapping material, so it was clear to the

18

officers that he was manipulating the contents, the drugs.

19

And at that point they did what we want officers

20

to do under those circumstances, they went to get a search

21

warrant.

QUESTION:

MR. FOSTER:

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Foster —
Your Honor.
Would, would those facts as you have

14

described them give rise to probable cause sufficient to

15

have arrested the individual?
MR. FOSTER:

16
17
18

I believe so, Your Honor.

believe —
QUESTION:

And could the sack then have been

19

searched as a search incident to the arrest or an

20

inventory search?

21

I

MR. FOSTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe either

22

as a -- as a search incident to the arrest -- and as we

23

point out in the brief, Your Honor, I think there's

24

another way that it could have been searched, which is

25

once he placed it into the vehicle, voluntarily and

intentionally taking advantage of the mobility of the car,

2

when he takes advantage of that aspect of the vehicle he

3

has to take at the same time the limitations that come

4

with it.

5

has clearly marked in Ross, Carroll, and Carney, which is

6

a lesser expectation of privacy, because of the mobility

7

of the vehicle.

8

probably --

The limitations that come with it, this Court

So at that point the officers would

QUESTION:

9

That's a little bit of a weak

10

argument.

11

you don't really expect the world to be looking in and

12

seeing what's there, do you?

13

When you put something in the trunk of a car

MR. FOSTER:

I don't think you expect the world

14

to be looking in, but I think as this Court held in Ross,

15

Your Honor, that whatever subjective expectation of

16

privacy you have does not survive when the officers have

17

probable cause to believe there are drugs in the vehicle.

18

I am sure when Mr. Ross in that case placed the bag of

19

drugs and the pouch of money into the trunk he had the

20

same subjective expectation as Mr. Acevedo.

21

In that sense the cases are very parallel,

22

because both Mr. Ross and Mr. Acevedo placed bags of drugs

23

into the trunk of their vehicles.

24

held that that subjective expectation of privacy was not

25

objectively reasonable.

And in Ross this Court

It did not survive in the face of

probable cause.
I think the point is that he — that it was a

2

3

voluntary and intentional act in his part in putting the

4

bag into the vehicle.

5

to exploit the mobility of the vehicle.
QUESTION:

6

And because of that he was seeking

But, Mr. Foster, was it any different

7

than the voluntary intentional act in Arkansas against

8

Sanders ?

9

MR. FOSTER:

No, Your Honor, but the difference

11
12

13

QUESTION:

So you basically want us to overrule

Arkansas against Sanders?
MR. FOSTER:

I want you to extremely limit

14

Arkansas v. Sanders, yes, Your Honor.

15

there's an institutional bias to saying the word overrule.

16

And I think Arkansas v. Sanders would have validity as to

17

luggage outside of the vehicle, but the main point --

18

QUESTION:

I understand that

Isn't it correct that in his separate

19

opinion in that case that Chief Justice Burger made the

20

very distinction that you're challenging here?

21

MR. FOSTER:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes, Your Honor.

That is correct.

So you're basically challenging his

analysis of the Fourth Amendment.
MR. FOSTER:

No, I thought I was supporting the

Chief Justice's analysis -7

Oh, I'm sorry.

Yes, I am

challenging —
QUESTION:

6

I'm talking about Chief Justice

He's the source of the particular

distinction that is at issue here.

7

MR. FOSTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

And if you notice

8

in Justice Burger's opinion there, he keeps talking about

9

the relationship between the bag and the vehicle as being

10

merely coincidental.

because it perceives the relationship as a fortuity, and

it was not a fortuity.

17

it, you take what comes with that mobility.

And I don't think that's an accurate

It was an intentional, voluntary

And I think when you

And that,

Yeah, but you don't have any mobility

20

anymore after the vehicle has been stopped and you have

21

got the container.

22

stopped him before he got in the vehicle?

23

Why is it any different than if you

MR. FOSTER:

Because since Chadwick and Sanders

this Court has decided Johns, Michigan v. Thomas, and

25

Florida v. Meyers, and you have said you don't judge

3

you had seized the item, the mobility, the necessity, the

4

mobility did not have any more effect.

5

said no, you judge it at the moment of seizure but you can

do the search later on.

7

this Court's evolving approach to automobile searches has

8

taken away the underpinnings of that.

9

You judge mobility at the moment of

Justice Burger's analysis was you judge -- once

QUESTION:

And this Court has

And I think what has happened is

Well, you rely heavily on Ross, and I

10

wonder if there's a single word in the Ross opinion that

11

casts doubt on Arkansas against Sanders.

12

MR. FOSTER:

No, but I didn't think you needed

13

to reach that issue to decide Ross, Your Honor.

14

indeed the footnote in place --

17

QUESTION:

And

The reason you didn't have to reach

it is because of this distinction.
MR. FOSTER:

To resolve it in Ross, no, you did

18

not, Your Honor.

19

And I think that if -- you know, that Mr. Ross and Mr. --

This case squarely presents the issue.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. FOSTER:

As did Arkansas against Sanders.
Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

22

And I am asking you to go back and reexamine those cases

23

in light of Ross and Carney and your more recent

24

pronouncements in the area.

25

spoke in that discussion, the underpinnings of Chadwick

And I think that the -- as we

and Sanders have been eaten away by this Court's

2

subsequent decisions.

3

your question, Chadwick and Sanders look at the search of

4

the bag, or the search of the closed container at the

5

point of the actual search, whereas this Court made it

6

clear in Ross that you look at it, the mobility, at the

7

moment of seizure.
Because if you look at it the other way the Ross

As we talked about in answering

holding would not stand, Your Honor, because as you well

10

recall, they searched the bag in the field, found it, took

11

it to the police station and then opened it again without

12

a warrant.

13

correct, Ross and Chadwick are in conflict, because Ross

14

made it clear that you look to the mobility at the moment

15

of seizure.

16

So that if the approach in Chadwick was

Additionally, Chadwick assumed that whatever

17

subjective expectation of privacy existed in that closed

18

container, that it continued ad in -- forever.

think this Court has made clear in Ross that that —

MR. FOSTER:

But Chadwick assumed that that

expectation continued, and in Ross I thought this Court

3

made it clear that whatever that subjective expectation of

4

privacy was, it did not survive in the face of probable

5

cause by the officers to believe there was contraband in

6

the vehicle.

7

believe there was contraband in the bag.

In this case there was probable cause to

QUESTION:

9

MR. FOSTER:

10

QUESTION:

If we accept your rationale -Yes, Your Honor.
-- isn't the next logical step really

11

to say that the warrant requirement is limited only to

12

houses and structures?

13

MR. FOSTER:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

14

that's necessarily true.

15

we're dealing here with a very special area, that is,

16

given the mobility of the automobile and its ability to

17

rapidly move out of the jurisdiction.

18

that -- that the logic of our position would be expandable

19

any further than a movable vehicle:

Well, certainly you to an extent

have already done that with Schimmel, Your Honor.

What's left?

9

Well, that's what I want to know.

What's left of the doctrine?

MR. FOSTER:

8

In the

left, Your Honor.

I think a number of things are

For example, in the Chadwick-Sanders

10

situation where the closed container comes off of the

11

train, the Amtrak coming from San Diego to Boston.

12

that situation, had the defendants gone one way and a

13

porter with a trunk gone the other way, and the arrest was

14

made at that time so that the closed container was not in

15

the immediate dominion and control, the area of arm's

16

reach of the defendants, you had a closed container with

17

probable cause, you still are going to need a warrant for

18

that.

19

you know, and -- this Court has struggled for over 65

20

years with searches of vehicles.

21

In

So I think we're asking for a much narrower rule,

In Ross you gave us a bright line that went two-

22

thirds of the way, and we're asking you to draw the line

23

the rest of the way so that the officers in the field —

MR. FOSTER:

QUESTION:

4

MR. FOSTER:

5

QUESTION:

I would hope not, Your Honor.

Mr. Foster -Your Honor.
You said in your example involving

6

the porter carrying the closed container that you need a

7

warrant for that.

8

porter and detain the bag or to search the bag?

9

A warrant to do what?

MR. FOSTER:

To stop the

To search the bag, Your Honor.

I

10

think that even accepting our position today, the warrant

11

would still apply to those -- to that closed container.

12

QUESTION:

All right, then why, by a parity of

13

reasoning, shouldn't you say that in this case that you

14

could seize the bag from the trunk of the car without a

15

warrant, but you should have to get the warrant in order

16

to go into the bag?

17

situations parallel?

18

Why aren't the — why aren't the two

MR. FOSTER:

Oh, I think there's a critical

19

difference, Your Honor.

21

begun to leave with it.

22

QUESTION:

The difference is the bag in this

No, but once you -- once you have

23

taken the bag the vehicle is not leaving with the bag, so

24

that the mobility argument is just as beside the point

25

there as it is in the porter case once you have taken the

bag from the porter.

2

MR. FOSTER:

But your -- with all due respect,

3

Your Honor, that's the analysis that was in Chadwick and

4

Sanders, and I think that the more recent decisions of

5

this Court say you look at the mobility at the moment you

6

seize it.

7

it has very limited mobility.

8

bag in the trunk of the car it has the same mobility as

9

the vehicle, as any other closed container.

At the moment you seize the bag from the porter

QUESTION:

10
11
12

At the moment you seize the

How does it have it after you have

seized it?
MR. FOSTER:

It does not, Your Honor, but you

13

look, after Johns, Thomas, Texas v. White, at mobility at

14

the point of seizure.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FOSTER:

If — but by —
The Court, this Court has held

17

that, given the fact that you have probable cause at the

18

moment of seizure, since you can seize it it is of no

19

Fourth Amendment consequence whether you search it

20

immediately or search it later on.

21

course, which was a case at the border, they waited 3 days

22

before they seized it -- before they searched it.

23

Court upheld that search since there was probable cause

24

and mobility at the moment of seizure.

25

the point, to answer Justice Souter's --

But by the same token there is just

QUESTION:

You mean he's going to walk slow

enough so that you can get the warrant before he gets to
the train?

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. FOSTER:

13

QUESTION:

No, no, no.
No, I mean that, that bag is going to

disappear.

15

the porter is mobile.

I'm having trouble seeing this moment of seizure

distinction as between the porter and the car.

18

And if the porter's — if the car is mobile,
If one isn't, the other isn't.

MR. FOSTER:

But

I think, though, that the answer,

19

Your Honor, goes back to the original holding in Carroll,

20

which is that the mobility of the car is such that it can

21

be rapidly moved outside of the jurisdiction.

22

individual simply carrying the bag or pushing it is not

mobile to that degree.

2

really sort of, sort of dropped the principle and just

3

said look, we're going to have a separate rule for cars

4

because it's just more difficult to draw these lines with

5

cars than it is with porters?
MR. FOSTER:

I mean, hasn't your argument

Well, I think that in a sense this

Court made the first step of that analysis in Carroll by

saying cars are different —

MR. FOSTER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FOSTER:

13

you have made that distinction.

dissents, given the mobility of the vehicle, given the

mobility of what has been placed into it —

Yes, Your Honor.

And ever since

Is there really very much at stake in

MR. FOSTER:

Well, if the officer had taken the

course of arresting the person, they could have carried

And -- so a police officer really

11

needn't be -- law enforcement needn't be very much impeded

12

by the ruling in this case because the officer could have

just have handled it differently.

14

MR. FOSTER:

Well, he could have, Your Honor,

15

but I think this case presents the issue that arose in

16

Castlebury and arises again, and arises in the field every

17

day.

18

if the principle, the underlying principle that caused the

court of appeals of California to invalidate the search

bedevils officers in the field.

drugs in the trunk of his car, and in a pouch in the trunk

I don't think that's right.

If they

have unparticularized probable cause as to the whole

MR. FOSTER:

Your Honor, where he has said it's in a bag in the trunk,

It seems --

Well, additionally elsewhere, if

that's enough probable cause, you can search elsewhere.

MR. FOSTER:

That's right.

But when you get to

of whether you needed a warrant, because your information,

Your Honor, I think that begs a

question, with all due respect, because even if you go to

challenging the validity of the search warrant.

the fact that a defendant may challenge it doesn't resolve

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED W. ANDERSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. ANDERSON:

11
12

Very well, Mr. Foster.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is not the search — this case is the

13
14

search of a container, not the search of a vehicle.

15

Fourth Amendment proscribes all unreasonable searches and

16

seizures, and it is a cardinal principle that searches

17

conducted outside the judicial process without prior

18

approval by a judge or magistrate are per se unreasonable

19

under the Fourth Amendment, subject to only a few

20

specifically established and well delineated exceptions.

21

This case is not an exception.

because what the AG would have you believe is that you

placed this container with probable cause in the trunk,

3

somehow this probable cause seeps throughout the whole

QUESTION:

5

undoubtedly probable cause to arrest the individual, to

make a search incident to arrest, to impound the vehicle,

and to make an inventory search.

There wasn't probable cause to arrest.

Then what's more intrusive, to have

that there was probable cause to believe this individual

10

then there was probable cause to have arrested him.

11

MR. ANDERSON:

12

QUESTION:

That's true.

That's correct.

Mr. Anderson, if I understand the

13

principle you're arguing for, if a policeman just knows,

14

or suspects generally, has probable cause to believe that

15

there is marijuana somewhere in the car, he can open the

16

bag?

17

MR. ANDERSON:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's --

But if he's more certain than that,

19

he not only knows it's somewhere in the car, he suspects

20

it's precisely in this bag, then he can't open the bag?

21

Doesn't that strike you as very strange?

22

MR. ANDERSON:

No, Your Honor, because you need

23

to know -- you need to know when the probable cause is

24

determined and where the item that is sought to be

25

searched is.

Ross, if the information was that bandit has contraband in

MR. ANDERSON:

I'll respectfully disagree with you, because I believe

that if you know exactly where the contraband is, then you

may seize whatever it's in and get a warrant to search it.

10

However, if that contraband -- and it doesn't matter

11

whether that contraband is in an auto or not.

12

you believe that the container of the contraband is a

vehicle, the Court has allowed under Carroll and later

under Ross — this exceptions the Fourth Amendment, the
