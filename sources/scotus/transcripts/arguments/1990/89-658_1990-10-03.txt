CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. COULSON

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. COULSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

This is a criminal tax case.

Just before

10

sentencing the petitioner, John L. Cheek, the district

11

court said to him,

12

beliefs that I believe were honestly held, although I

13

believe foolishly held."

14

speaking, and that is what this case is fundamentally all

15

about.

16

"I do not want to sentence you for

That is the district court

Petitioner John Cheek's defense, albeit a pro se

17

defense, was a classic mistake of law based in part on

18

advice he got from counsel.

19

times of the alleged offenses he had a bona fide

20

misunderstanding of his duties under the tax laws.

21

is a recognized defense.

in Murdock in 1933, some 57 years ago.

He contended that at all

Circuit in October of 1987 in the United States v. Buckner

2

decided that in so-called tax-protester cases it wasn't

3

enough that the tax defendant's misunderstanding or

4

belief, as the Seventh Circuit calls it, be sincerely held

5

or bona fide per Murdock, but also the defendant's

6

understanding or belief of the tax laws had to be found by

7

the jury to be objectively reasonable, whatever that

8

means.

9

Moreover, as to certain enumerated

10

understandings, or beliefs, or misunderstandings of the

11

tax laws, it wasn't enough even for a defendant to

12

convince a jury that he sincerely possessed the

13

misunderstanding and that the misunderstanding was

14

objectively reasonable.

15

the Seventh Circuit held that they were forever

16

objectively unreasonable as a matter of law.

17

QUESTION:

But as to those listed beliefs

Mr. Coulson, you don't have to go to

18

law school to learn that traditionally mistake of law is

19

--is no defense.

20

here, because of the word willfully in the statute?

21

Why is there, why should it be a defense

MR. COULSON:

Because this Court and other

22

courts have recognized that in the criminal tax statutes,

23

the mistake of law defense has particular vitality.

24

QUESTION:

Why should that be?

25

MR. COULSON:

Because the tax codes are complex

in numerous respects.

are malum prohibitum rather than malum in se.
QUESTION:

3

Unlike most criminal statutes they

So do we import these same standards

4

into the antitrust laws, which are also complex -- the

5

case laws if not statutory?
MR. COULSON:

6

I'm not suggesting that the

7

doctrine that we suggest remain the law of the land be

8

applied to anything other than criminal tax statutes.

9
10

QUESTION:

But why should criminal tax statutes

be singled out for this treatment?
MR. COULSON:

11

This Court has singled them out

12

for that treatment and other courts have, recognizing that

13

in the tax area it is easy, relatively easy for a well-

14

minded individual to violate the law, because the law is

15

complex.

16

- under these -- in this context and under the criminal

17

tax statutes.

18

has said that, the circuits have said that.

19

Mistake of law has particular vitality in this -

And I say that not only because this Court

QUESTION:

Well, what if the taxpayer understood

20

that the law says you'll file a tax return, but genuinely

21

believed the -- the tax law was unconstitutional?

22

that be a defense to willfulness?

23

MR. COULSON:

Would

No, but it's -- personal belief

24

that a known statute is unconstitutional smacks of

25

knowledge with existing law, but disagreement with it.

And I am not suggesting that any individuals --

4

that is the belief.

Well, someone in good faith believes

It is not objectively reasonable to believe that, but
Now is that a defense to willfulness?

MR. COULSON:

5

It depends on the nature of the

6

defense.

7

known -- law known to them is unconstitutional, I submit

8

that that would not be a defense, because what the person

9

is really saying is I know what the law is, for

that it is invalid.

12

defense.

13

I am not suggesting that that is a

However, if the person was told by a lawyer or

14

by an accountant erroneously that the statute is

15

unconstitutional, and it's my professional advice to you

16

that you don't have to follow it, then you have got a

17

little different situation.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

This is not that case --

How do you instruct the jury so that

they can convict in the one case and acquit in the other?
MR. COULSON:

You instruct the jury that

21

disagreement with known law is not a defense.

22

instruct the jury that --

24
25

QUESTION:

A known law?

You

Known to whom?

Known

to the defendant?
MR. COULSON:

Known to the defendant.

All of --

1

our position obviously is that all of this deals with the

2

defendant's personal view, the defendant's personal state

3

of mind, the defendant's personal knowledge.

QUESTION:
that is on the books?

MR. COULSON:

No.

If the Government can prove

that the defendant knew what the law is and chose -QUESTION:

And a known law is a — is a statute

He knew that the statute was on the

books?
MR. COULSON:

10

No, he knew of his duties under

11

the tax laws a la Murdock.

12

just knowing there is a statute on the books.
QUESTION:

13

That is a little broader than

He knows -- he knows his duty under

14

the statute, and he knows that it's the (inaudible) of the

15

Government to prosecute if he violates that duty.

No, because it would depend on the

particular misunderstanding that is in issue.

7

He really -- he honestly -- it's an

Sincerity of belief, that's the test?

MR. COULSON:

The test is sincerity of belief as

8

to his understanding of his duties under the tax laws, and

9

that is taken from Murdock.
QUESTION:

10

Suppose — the Seventh Circuit has

11

ruled that he has to file and that the Seventh Circuit has

12

ruled contrary to his beliefs.
MR. COULSON:

13

A ruling that he has to file may

14

or may not be relevant to his own belief given his tax

15

situation.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

(Inaudible) the Seventh Circuit has

ruled that his belief was held in error.
MR. COULSON:

That would be a fact which the

19

Government would elicit.

20

on that fact as well as other facts that the defendant may

21

present, whether or not his good faith -- his

22

misunderstanding is in good faith or is pretextual, just

23

as the jury does in any other --

then?

2

MR. COULSON:

No.

If he testifies and the

3

Government is able to elicit on cross-examination that he

4

is aware of the Seventh Circuit case, and he is aware the

5

Seventh Circuit thinks he is wrong, I rather suspect the

jury would convict him in this situation.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Well, I am stipulating to you that he

15

has an honest, sincere belief that the Seventh Circuit is

16

180 degrees wrong.

17

MR. COULSON:

I would submit that that would

18

establish, at least if I were on the jury, as disagreement

19

with what he knows to be the law.

20

QUESTION:

The question isn't what —

QUESTION:

Justice Marshall has had a question

he wants to ask.

Would you make the same defense to a

civil action?

No.

different.

2

QUESTION:

And that's what I would like for you

3

to explain, other than that civil and criminal are

4

different.

5

MR. COULSON:

I guess the most obvious example

6

is his rule 11, or sanctions.

7

position that is sanctionable under rule 11, even if you

8

believe it to be true, if it's a frivolous position.

9

Whereas to put somebody in jail, to convict somebody of a

You could take a legal

10

criminal offense, it seems to me the Government needs to

11

show that it was a willful act.
QUESTION:

12

13

You mean in a tax defense -- a tax

case?

14

MR. COULSON:

In a tax case.

I am confining all

15

of my remarks here to tax cases because, as this Court has

16

pointed out, the willfulness element is somewhat unique in

17

tax cases.
QUESTION:

18

I just want to follow up on Justice

19

Kennedy's question, because I don't think you have

20

answered.

You have given us a prediction what the jury

21

would do.

Say you are a trial judge and you are convinced

22

that when this man gets on the stand and says I think not

23

only the Seventh Circuit is wrong, but the United States

24

Supreme Court is wrong, and that the Constitution does not

25

require me to pay these taxes.

Does he win or does he lose?

He believes him.

MR. COULSON:

9

That's what I am

Then what does the judge

The judge rules that that is not a

good-faith misunderstanding of one's duties to file.

It

10

is rather a knowledge of existing law and a belief that it

11

is wrong, and that defense does not go to the jury.

12

that --

13
14

QUESTION:

And

In other words, belief that the

statute is unconstitutional is a belief that it's wrong?

15

MR. COULSON:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's not what Murdock -- Murdock

17

was a constitutional case, you know.

You can even stop

18

short of the unconstitutional point.

All -- you're --

19

you're stopping short -- you want to stop short of saying

20

that a belief that is unconstitutional is a good -- like

21

some of the other justices, I don't see the basis for

22

drawing that line.

23

But you don't -- you don't stop short of saying

24

that belief that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted the

25

statute is -- is not a good-faith defense.

Suppose he

doesn't think that the Constitution entitles him to say

that wages are not income, but that simply the Supreme

MR. COULSON:

I am trying to draw a distinction

between knowing what the law is and disagreeing with it,

which is not a good-faith misunderstanding of your duty to

MR. COULSON:

QUESTION:

3

Well, it is.

That is my position.

But only -- in other words,

everything goes to the Supreme Court?

4

MR. COULSON:

Not at all.

Not at all.

This

5

case did not involve Mr. Cheek's contentions that the

6

statutes were unconstitutional, and that's why I am

7

dealing with these hypotheticals the way I am.

8

good-faith misunderstanding of his duties under the tax

9

statutes in a number of various ways based on all the

10

indoctrination he got.
QUESTION:

He had a

Do you concede that those beliefs

were not objectively reasonable beliefs?

MR. COULSON:

I do not concede that.

I believe

Did you preserve that issue for

review here then, or do we have to take it on the

deciding the case, and did you preserve that issue

QUESTION:

I don't know if I am

Part of your claim is, if you

4

preserved it, that it's objectively reasonable to think

5

that wages are not income?
MR. COULSON:

6

It would be objectively

7

unreasonable to a lawyer or to a judge.

8

and I contend here it was objectively reasonable to

9

somebody like Mr. Cheek, who was a lay person and who was

It might well be,

10

confused and who was hit with this tax-protester

11

literature and these lectures and these statements from

12

attorneys.

13

determination of each defendant?

14

Our point is isn't it an individualized

QUESTION:

Well, then, but then what use is the

15

term objectively reasonable, if it is an individualized

16

determination and if it would be -- objectively

17

unreasonable for most people, but not objectively

18

unreasonable for your client?

That illustrates the impossibility

of dealing with what -- the term the Seventh Circuit has

defined.

whether the jury finds that the defendant sincerely

2

believes -- has a sincere misunderstanding of his duties

under the tax law.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what, what standard were you

5

applying when you answered these questions about if the

6

Supreme Court has held that wages are income and he -- you

say that he couldn't possibly have -- have a defense in

that respect.

9

MR. COULSON:

No.

If he knows -- if the

10

Government proves he knows that the Supreme Court has held

11

that.

All right, he knows it, but he says

they got it wrong.

And I am suggesting that that has to be a

QUESTION:

He -- he mistakenly thought the

5

Supreme Court had it wrong.

6

isn't that a defense?

7

MR. COULSON:

He just made a mistake.

Why

Because -- I'm not suggesting that

8

every citizen has the prerogative to decide for himself if

9

he is going to obey what this Court or any other court

10
11

says.
QUESTION:

Or suppose that the Treasury

12

regulations say wages are income and are taxable, and he

13

says well, I know that, and regulation is supposed to be

14

the law, but the Commissioner just had it wrong.

15
16
17

They --

those regulations are just inconsistent with the statute,
or with the Constitution.
MR. COULSON:

The first example would present

18

for the jury a fact question.

19

he sincerely confused about the law, and if so how?

20

did he come to that confusion, that misunderstanding?

21

is he pretextual, does he know darn well what the law is?

22

QUESTION:

The jury would decide, is
How
Or

Counselor, that is just not helpful

23

for this argument.

What we're trying to establish, and I

24

think it's a difficult case, is what instruction the judge

25

should give to the jury.

What is the standard for guilt.

And if you say, oh, that's for the jury, that doesn't help

22

The obvious purpose of the criminal tax

24

to induce the prompt fulfillment of every duty under the

25

tax laws.

At the same time the Court has understood

Congress not to want to punish what it termed innocent

2

errors made despite the exercise of reasonable care in

3

trying to comply with the complex tax code, those

4

provisions that are complex.

5

And this Court has construed that criminal tax

6

statute in a line of cases that seek to give effect to

7

both of those purposes, in particular as the Court stated

8

in Bishop, and I quote,

9

willfully in a way that implements the intent of Congress

"It has construed the term

10

to construct penalties that separate the purposeful tax

11

violator on the one hand from the well-meaning but easily

12

confused mass of taxpayers on the other."

13

In this case petitioner Cheek is far removed

14

from the category of innocent but well meaning class of

15

categories, those seeking to comply with the sometimes

complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

obligations in the tax code that are at issue here, the

He didn't think the code required that.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, most of his arguments in

tax is a direct tax that has to be apportioned among the

states, which is just simply wrong under Pollock --

He's abandoning that, as I understood

the argument.

not being made that if he thinks the statute is

unconstitutional he has a defense.

Illogically, perhaps, but the assertion is

MR. KNEEDLER:

I understood him to be abandoning

that as well, although I would like to point out that --

that even the courts that have adopted the purely subject

standard for claims to a belief that income -- that a

certain duty under the code is not required, it's purely

subjective.

19

the statute is unconstitutional is not a defense.

Those courts have all said that a belief that

And there is a statutory basis for that, because

21

both 7201 and 7203 refer to evading titles imposed by this

MR. KNEEDLER:

The instruction is that we have

to show that there was a violation of a known legal duty.

Then, no matter who it is, this

12

is a ruling -- this is a determination that that is not an

13

acceptable basis for declining to comply with the tax

code.

15

doesn't turn on somebody's ability to do legal research on

other objections.

understand it, was the claim that wages are not income.

2

If you look at his testimony in this case, and

3

as this argument has been presented in other cases, that

4

is -- that has also been presented as a constitutional

5

argument, that wages involve an equal exchange of labor

6

for compensation.

7

it can't be taxed.

8

which is a direct tax which can't be taxed under the

9

Sixteenth Amendment.

There is no gain or profit, therefore
It's in effect a tax of his property,

So even that argument, as it has

10

traditionally been interpreted, or traditionally —

11

traditionally been presented and as it has been presented

12

by Mr. Cheek in this case, is at bottom a constitutional

13

objection and falls in that same category.

about that.

2

objectionably reasonable or not, or let the jury decide

3

this semi-legal question?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think one approach would

5

be for the judge to say it's objectively reasonable, and

6

then not even instruct the jury on the question.

7

think if you look at Murdock, that is exactly the

8

procedural approach the Court --

QUESTION:

And I

The Court decided it there.

MR. KNEEDLER:

The Court decided it.

What the

11

Court said is because the law was uncertain at the time

12

that he declined to furnish the information, it was

13

improper for the judge to in effect instruct the jury that

14

Murdock's belief was so unreasonable and ill founded --

15

the words the court used — to amount to willfulness.

16

the clear implication, the other side of what the court

17

was saying, is if the -- if that question had been

18

settled, as it subsequently was by this Court, if that

19

question had been settled by this Court at the time that

20

Murdock acted, then the district court should not have

21

submitted that to the jury at all.

22

QUESTION:

But

Well, maybe the solution to this

23

problem is never to instruct the jury on an -- to make an

24

objectively reasonable determination, but have the judge

25

decide whether or not the defense is sufficient or not,

6

QUESTION:

And as I say, that has

That is I think what the

Mr. Kneedler, the problem with that

7

and the problem with having a laundry list, as the Seventh

8

Circuit does, is that the statute, it seems to me, and

9

using the term willfully clearly -- clearly requires an

10

individuated determination.

12

my boy, wages are not income, is — is his reasonableness

13

in believing that wages are not income no different from

the reasonableness of someone who just -- just hears it

from somebody on the street?

And I am not

1

sure that's true, and I think the statute does require an

2

individuated determination.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Our second position in the case

4

is that there may be cases in which it would be proper to

5

submit to the jury, but these beliefs in this case are

6

unreasonable — unreasonable as a matter of law or

7

unavailable as a matter of law.

You certainly didn't object to the

business of unreasonable belief going to the jury in this
case.

MR. KNEEDLER:

particular beliefs that Mr. Cheek was offering here are

not objectively reasonable as a matter of law, either on

the theory that this is always a question for the judge,

think that a requirement that a jury acquit a defendant as

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. COULSON:

Your Honor, the Government is

16

taking the position that no one who possesses the belief

17

that wages are not income can ever be not guilty.

18

are taking the position that it doesn't matter whether a

19

lawyer tells you that, as happened in John Cheek's case,

20

or an accountant tells you that.

because the Government says the content of that belief is

on this forbidden list.

that under the Internal Revenue Code wages were not

MR. COULSON:

The Government, I think,

exaggerates the significance of that evidence.

what he really understood and what he claimed he

understood.
