That is the conditions that you have in your cell for a --

21

that continue, those are what we mean as punishment.

And

22

for those conditions, there is no state of mind test.

The

23

reason that in Whitley the Court applied the state of mind

test was that it was dealing with conditions that were not

that the Court majority in Estelle also viewed that as, as

prescient comment, when it's — when you look at something

Given the Court's construction in Estelle of the

makes sense.

then there is no need to put this extra complication in the

QUESTION:

Ms. Alexander, you've confused me now.

I thought you were drawing the distinction between long term

it has changed to systemic versus nonsystemic.
