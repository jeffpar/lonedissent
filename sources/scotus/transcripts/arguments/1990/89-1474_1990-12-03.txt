ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. DOYLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DOYLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case before you today involves a question of

11
12

statutory interpretation; specifically who is entitled to

13

sue for damages under the Jones Act.

14

is also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 provides

15

a right of action to a seaman who is injured in the course

16

of his employment.

17

in the body of the statute and it has been the subject of

18

much debate.

19

That section, which

The term seaman is not defined further

This case also provides an opportunity for the

20

Court to reestablish and reaffirm a uniform national rule.

The last definitive opinion reached by this Court was 33

22

years ago.

23

divergent tracks which have been taken from that opinion

24

even though it was clear.

status questions based on an analysis, at least in part,

2

of the subject seaman's relationship to the transportation

3

function or the navigation function of the vessel.

4

Fifth Circuit in particular among

the others does not take

5

this into consideration, at least

not in the same way.

6

This has led to an inconsistency of results throughout the

7

country and needs to be addressed.

9

The

This case particularly draws that line for the
Court, because in this case there

is little question, and

10

the Fifth Circuit so found, that Mr. Wilander, the seaman,

11

the person claiming status under the act had no

12

responsibilities relative to the vessel to which he

13

claimed status which were related to its transportation or

14

navigational function.

MR. DOYLE:

1

No, not in this case, Your Honor,

2

because the person he was bringing suit against would have

3

been his employer and except for the Jones Act's variation

4

from the general common law there would be no action

5

against his employer for the general maritime negligence.

6

QUESTION:

Now, may I also ask you what

7

difference you think it makes whether Mr. Wilander aided

8

in the navigation of the vessel?

9

and works aboard ship — why isn't that person just as

If a person who lives

10

much a member of the crew, as it were, as someone who aids

11

in navigation?
MR. DOYLE:

12

I think that the concept of aid to

13

navigation has always been considered as a degree of the

14

permanency of the attachment between the worker and the

15

employer's vessel.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DOYLE:

But not a necessary concept.
Well, the Fifth Circuit says it's

18

not necessary, but the other circuit courts seem to say

19

that it is, in its particular --

QUESTION:

21

MR. DOYLE:

And we haven't spoken to the issue?
You have spoken to the issue many

22

times.

requirement.

1

with your question, it must be at all times considered

2

when reviewing the Jones Act that it is an

3

employment-based statute.

4

the reasonable expectations of the employer and the

5

employee.

6

have been perfectly justified in believing that an

7

employee such as Mr. Wilander, who is a painter foreman

8

operating on platforms in the Persian Gulf, would be more

9

exposed to those types of hazards and risks associated

It's a statute which depends on

In this case, McDermott International would

of the sea.

to Justice O'Connor's question.

15

purpose of his Jones Act claim.

QUESTION:

Would you comment on the facts a

little bit to that extent?

18

MR. DOYLE:

19

QUESTION:

20

Mr. Wilander did not live

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
I guess he slept, ate, and planned

his activities aboard the barge DB-9?
MR. DOYLE:

21

That is correct, Your Honor.

He

did.

1

of the crew of DB-9?

2

MR. DOYLE:

No, I don't, because he's not a

3

member of the crew of that vessel any more than he is of

4

the Gates Tide, since he did not contribute to the

5

transportation or navigational function of the DB-9.
QUESTION:

6
7

Assuming we think that's an essential

test --

8

MR. DOYLE:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. DOYLE:

Exactly so.
— which the Fifth Circuit does not.
Exactly so.

But this Court's

11

opinion in Senko v. La Crosse Dredging is relevant,

12

because the DB-9 when it performs its work, you'll find

13

from the record, is frequently tied up to a platform.

14

It's not mobile.

15

serves as a floating hotel.

in Senko this quotation is found:

vessel, Mr. Chief Justice, in its use as a vessel as

the actual steering of the ship, then?

6

MR. DOYLE:

QUESTION:

8
9

So they don't have to participate in

Exactly.
That would be true of repair people,

too?
MR. DOYLE:

Well, repair people present a

10

special problem because, of course, ship repairs are

11

specifically identified under the L&H Act and it could be

12

that under some circumstances they would be covered there

13

and not under the Jones Act, but if they're brought along

14

on a sea voyage, specifically for the purpose of

15

conducting those repairs to the engines or the

16

appurtenances of the vessel which are required during its

17

voyage, they are aiding that vessel in its navigation

18

every bit as much as the master.

19

QUESTION:

How about the dance instructor and

20

the bartender on the Love Boat?

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. DOYLE:

They, also, Justice O'Connor, aid,

23

aid in the function of the vessel, for a different reason

24

though perhaps.

25

QUESTION:

Are they covered?

1

MR. DOYLE:

I think they are covered but perhaps

2

for a different reason.

The analysis that I've made of

3

those types of activities in the brief is one which points

4

out that the — that the cruise ship engages in maritime

5

commerce and part of its business is to transport

6

passengers from one place to another and to keep them

7

entertained during the vessel's journey.

8

they perform a necessary function of the vessel in

9

maritime commerce which is no different from that

Since they do,

10

performed by the fishermen who are on the fishery ship or

11

the cook who's represented on the tug boat which plies the

12

waters around Manhattan Island.

Do you think your — the Seventh

Circuit agrees with your view?

appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
MR. DOYLE:

No, sir, it doesn't sound like their

circumstance.

2

which under title I, section 3 would have been a vessel

3

but reached a point in its life when it was not and that's

4

when this particular individual in Johnson did his work,

5

was when the vessel was no longer a Jones Act vessel.
QUESTION:

6

7

Well, let me -- how do you differ

then with the Fifth Circuit?
MR. DOYLE:

8
9

A person who was working aboard a structure

I differ in this way.

The Fifth

Circuit says that your connection with a vessel as a

10

putative seaman is relevant if you are connected only to

11

those activities which are conducted aboard the vessel

12

when it's stopped.

13

the Fifth Circuit, which is primarily the oil field area,

14

which holds that a function which is being performed by a

15

person who is a seaman on “a nontraditional vessel is

16

performed while the vessel is in motion or truly within

17

navigation.

18

There's not a case that I've seen in

Mr. Wilander's is a case in point.

19

Tide is a vessel.

20

Wilander didn't have anything to do aboard that vessel

21

until it was moored to the platform.

22

It's a 185-foot crew boat.

QUESTION:

But Mr.

Likewise the crew —

Do you take the position he was

simply in the position of a passenger aboard the Gates

MR. DOYLE:

MR. DOYLE:

I do.
You think he's just a passenger?
Well, he is just a passenger who is

there in an employment-related function.

QUESTION:

8

MR. DOYLE:

9

In that sense I

He's also an employee?
He's an employee, not a master of

the Gates Tide, but an employee of McDermott International

10

which had chartered it.

11

Justice O'Connor, I would submit that Mr. Wilander's

12

employment-related connection with respect to the Gates

13

Tide is no different in any material degree from a legal

14

secretary who works in a Manhattan law firm and lives on

15

Staten Island and rides the ferry to work every day.

16

QUESTION:

But further to your question,

Did the employer own all these

17

vessels, the Gates Tide, and — or lease the Gates Tide

18

and the DB-9?

19

MR. DOYLE:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DOYLE:

22

23

The employer owned the DB-9 —
Is it a group of vessels, in effect?
There were a group of vessels there,

yes, ma'am.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe we should look at whether

24

he's attached to "a group of vessels."

possibility?

Is that a

MR. DOYLE:

1

That is a possibility; however, in

2

this case it presents special problems, because not all of

3

the vessels to which he could have been detached were

4

American.

5

actually the Gates Tide which was only there for 5 days

during the 15 months that Mr. Wilander was employed was

the only American vessel that was on the job.

The DB-9, as I told you, was Panamanian and

doesn't do anything to the vessel.

13

certainly is the — he is performing the entire mission of

14

the vessel.

15

involved in this case, the whole reason for this -- for

16

this ship he's on is to go around and tie up and let the

fellow paint, just like — instead of harpooning a whale

he's doing some painting, which is the only reason that

Justice White, I'd appreciate the

21

opportunity to finish my answer to your earlier question.

22

The distinction here is that the fisherman who is looking

23

for the whales is performing a mission of the vessel which

24

is engaged in maritime commerce.

25

because the mission that he's performing is solely and

Not so Mr. Wilander,

strictly related to the platform.
QUESTION:

2

So, so if this fellow had

3

been — while the boat that he was — the boat where he

4

was living and operating — if he had been hurt on the way

5

would he have been a seaman?

6

MR. DOYLE:

7

QUESTION:

8

Well, it would have been in

navigation.
MR. DOYLE:

9
10

No, sir, I think not, but perhaps

The vessel would have been in

navigation.
QUESTION:

11

He would have been -- and his being

12

carried to do his mission is certainly part of the boat's

13

mission.

14

MR. DOYLE:

I think this, Justice White.

I

15

think that he has to form an attachment to the vessel

16

which is employment-related in scope and in content.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DOYLE:

No, go ahead.
And to restrict — and to restrict

19

that as the Fifth Circuit does — not to restrict it,

20

rather to broaden it as the Fifth Circuit does -- and to

21

say that we are going to consider your attachment to the

22

special mission as satisfying all requirements of status

23

under the aid to navigation test is inconsistent with what

24

this Court has ever said.

Justice White's question about the harpooner on a whale

2

boat.

Why is the respondent Wilander different?

3

MR. DOYLE:

4

QUESTION:

Well —
You added that one wasn't in maritime

5

commerce, but that's simply adding on something to the

6

mission of the ship that I hadn't understood from your

7

previous definition.

8

MR. DOYLE:

9

Well, in my brief, Mr. Chief

Justice, I had taken pains to point out that the Jones

10

Act's outer limits is going to be defined in some way as

11

what maritime commerce has covered and engaged in by the

12

vessel and I suggest in my brief that part of the reason

13

why the Robison opinion to the Fifth Circuit has lost its

14

support —■
QUESTION:

15
16

Well can't you answer the question

any more shortly than that?

17

MR. DOYLE:

I'm sorry.

I believe that the

18

whaling vessel is different from a vessel which is going

19

from platform to platform and after the rides is not

20

engaged in maritime commerce, while the whaling vessel is

21

at all times engaged in this type of commerce.
QUESTION:

22

Well, that still doesn't get to

23

why — you mean just that because the vessel has stopped

24

and tied up, he suddenly changes from a seaman to a

25

nonseaman?

For one thing, Mr. Chief Justice, in

8

the real world, the person who is the whale spotter on the

vessel is going to have other duties and he is going to

10

form that type of permanent attachment to the vessel which

11

is related to navigation.

QUESTION:

MR. DOYLE:

That wasn't in my hypothetical.
No, sir.
All he did — his only job on that

mean if they had gone out hunting seals, they had to get

MR. DOYLE:

But he would if he goes for whales,

That's right.

MR. DOYLE:

Well, in the case involving the seal

clubbers which is in the respondent's brief —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DOYLE:

Right.
-- I believe that the distinction

8

there between their case and mine is that those people

9

performed the mission — the only mission that the vessel

10

had to do which was in maritime commerce.

11

they could perform it was to engage in that type of

12

activity.

13

The only way

Therefore -QUESTION:

Well, what's it saying here if

14

somebody's on a boat that does nothing but carry people to

15

paint?

16

carries people to harvest seals.

17

I mean that's the boat's mission.

MR. DOYLE:

This other boat

Well, as I've said, Justice Scalia,

18

I think that the aid to navigation requirement at its base

19

is an indicator, one of perhaps more than one, of the

20

connexity between the seaman and the vessel itself.

21

The people who are engaged in a voyage which has

22

several points of terminus, such as the seal clubbers,

23

could be more attached to the vessel for another reason,

24

not having anything to do with aid to navigation.

25

Wilander's different because he only used this boat to go

that the vessel that was involved in the case that was

MR. DOYLE:

Well, it is a requirement that the

seaman, the person seeking status under the act, have a

18

permanent attachment to the vessel.

19

the attachment in the seal clubber case is more permanent

20

than Mr. Wilander's, because he only used this vessel for

limited purposes; to go back and forth to the platforms on

11

activities which they are aiding.

12

Then we got to the question of the harpooner or

13

the seal harpooner and the problem that you had with

14

including the seal harpooner was that the ship was not

15

moving at the time he harpooned and that the harpooning

16

was not, as I understand it, an act in furtherance of

the — of maritime commerce and I think the trouble, at

18

least that I'm having, is understanding what you mean by

19

maritime commerce.

20

and the dance instructor, the ship is at least part of the

21

time moving around because that's the way it makes its

22

money, by carrying people, and the reason they want to be

carried in the ship includes the fact that they would like

24

to avail themselves of dancing and the drinking that goes

the Coast Guard if the vessel is engaged in oceanography.

Now, obviously this statute would never have been

4

necessary except that Congress recognized these scientists

5

6

I feel that the fourth and clearest indicia of

7

congressional intent came in 1970 and 1971 when Senator

8

John Tower of Texas introduced legislation to extend the

9

benefits of the Longshoreman Act to workers employed

10

offshore in marine extractive operations, which the bill

11

defined as basically anything to do with mineral

12

production over navigable waters.

13

The bill would have made such compensation the

14

sole and exclusive remedy; no more Jones Act, no more

15

General Maritime Law, no more Death on the High Seas Act

16

and it would have amended the Longshoremans Act to remove

17

the exclusion from member of a crew of a vessel unless

18

that person was engaged solely under the Manning

Requirements set forth by the United States Coast Guard.

20

So this bill would have in effect have codified

mineral production takes place over navigable waters.

MRS. BERCIER:

The Seventh Circuit is the only

alternative if you — if you want to make a bartender and

making the bartender and the dance instructor seamen is

that they contribute to the mission of the vessel.

that would equally apply to Mr. Wilander in this case.

I think it is very important for the Court to

15

understand that Mr. Wilander was not in this case left

without a remedy and I would specifically refer the Court

a convincing argument could be made to include Jonah and

There's just no logical end to it.
In the Fifth Circuit in 1982, four judges on a

9

MR. DOYLE:

Well, I think that's the result

which has now been reached.

I think that if there's an

10

argument that can be made by principled jurists that a

11

helicopter is a vessel, the rule is too lax in the Fifth

Circuit and it needs to be shored up.

14

men that are serving upon it.

And the navigation

Of course, if the helicopter were a

vessel the pilot would clearly be a seaman.

MR. DOYLE:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And your assertion here is that this

boat was not being used as a vessel when it just tied

alongside to do painting.

7

MR. DOYLE:

No, sir, not — it might be a fine

distinction, Justice Scalia, but it is not that the boat

was not being used as a vessel.

It's that the function

MR. DOYLE:

no different from the crane barge which is a vessel for

6

some purposes but has been specifically held not only in

7

the Fourth Circuit but the Fifth, not to be a vessel for

Jones Act purposes.

9

QUESTION:

But what you're really saying I think

10

then is that vessel has to mean or has to be defined in

11

terms of ways common to all possible vessels.

12

what you're saying?

13

MR. DOYLE:

Isn't that

Well, I'm saying that the

14

distinction that's drawn is between the statutory

15

definition of a vessel which covers a multitude of

16

appliances and the use to which that appliance is put once

17

it goes to work.

18

QUESTION:

All right, so there's a distinction

19

between vessel as such and vessel with a specific purpose

20

in a given case.

21

MR. DOYLE:

22

QUESTION:

Jones Act, yes, sir.
All right, so if your criterion is

23

going to be what is common to all vessels as such, how can

you consistently concede that the bartenders and the dance

MR. DOYLE:

Again, because of their connection

So he never
