ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

Congress has given the regulators of the Nation's

12

financial

13

discretionary authority to achieve the specific policy ends

14

of safeguarding the accounts of depositors and protecting

15

the taxpayer-funded system of depository insurance.

16

is precisely the sort of discretion that Congress chose to

17

protect against attack when, as a safeguard to the limited

18

waiver of sovereign immunity embodied in the Federal Tort
