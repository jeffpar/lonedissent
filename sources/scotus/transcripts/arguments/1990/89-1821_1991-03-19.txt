ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. STEINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner Charles Stevens, a 67-year-old

12

employee of the Internal Revenue Service is before this

13

Court today, asking it to reverse the decision of the

14

court below, dismissing his age discrimination and

15

employment case and to remand this case for a decision on

16

the merits in Federal district court.

17

agrees that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act

18

entitles petitioner to this relief.

19

The respondent

Section 15(c) of the ADEA gives Federal

20

employees the right to file civil actions in Federal

21

district court to remedy age discrimination in their

22

employment.

23

precondition to this is that the employee must, under

24

section 15(d), give not less than 30 days' notice of his

25

intent to sue before filing sue, and must give that notice

The parties agree that the only statutory

is undisputed the petitioner in this case did both of

3

these things.

4

It

The court before however held incorrectly that

suit had to be filed within 30 days of the notice, and

therefore, dismissed the petitioner's suit as being filed

too long after his notice.

13

There's a second question that arises in this

14

case, and it has to do with a separate section of the act,

15

section 15(b), which creates an administrative process to

16

parties here today agree that this separate administrative

They ruled on both questions.

QUESTION:

The court of appeals did?

MS. STEINER:

The court of appeals adopted the

district court's ruling when it affirmed the holding that

the administrative tardiness mandated dismissal.

MS. STEINER:

That is the ground that is cited

at the conclusion of the court of appeals' opinion.

finding that the district court determined that the

administrative filing was not timely and affirmed that

finding.

of White v. Frank.

precedence in the Fifth Circuit is to that effect and that

20

other circuits the Sixth, in the Langford case.

filed.
It is undisputed, of course, that the petitioner

13

attempted to press his claim in the 15(b) administrative

14

arena but was denied the right to do so because he started

15

that too late.

16

And we do not dispute that.

The court below, in affirming the district

17

court, erroneously found a linkage between the

18

petitioner's tardiness and the -- and its right to dismiss

19

the suit, and thus construed his time default in the

20

administrative arena as a failure to exhaust the remedies

21

which supported its dismissal of the suit.

22

The issue was raised in the district court,

23

argued at some length by the respondent taking the

24

opposite position that it is taking here today, and

decided — and even conceded by respondent in its brief in

opposition to certiorari as a plausible interpretation of

2

the court of appeals' decision.

3

It is the subject of a clear conflict among the

4

circuits desperately needing resolution.

5

would be necessary to ensure in this case that the court

6

of appeals does not simply reiterate the failure in the

7

administrative arena as grounds for affirming the

8

dismissal since it has already ruled that the untimeliness

The 15(b) exhaustion of remedies questioned is

easy to resolve simply by reference to the statutory

language.

However, neither the district court nor the

11

court of appeals considered this sufficient to meet the

exhaustion requirement each believed should be imposed.

13

Instead, they articulated an exhaustion requirement

14

analogous to that imposed on Federal employees who are

15

seeking relief under title VII for race, sex, religion,

16

national origin, or color-base discrimination.

exhaustion requirement does, under the precedent of this

been invoked in an untimely fashion as it was here.

the prospective defendant may learn of the claim and

remove the cause for it if that is possible within the

time frame.

In contract, title VII expressly conditions

concluded or deemed by statute to have been exhausted by

11

the elapsing of a 180-day period.

12

In light of these differences, the analogy to

title VII is clearly inappropriate and should be rejected

14

by this Court.

found such an exhaustion requirement have relied heavily

16

on that analogy.

17

The courts below have — will — who have

MS. WAX:

The Government has no serious disagreement with

petitioner's position on the merits in this case.

With

14

all due respect to this Court, however, we remain puzzled

15

as to why we are here at all.

16

The Court has repeatedly stated that it will not

17

pass on issues neither presented nor decided in the courts

18

below.

19

stated in our opposition to certiorari and in our brief

20

that petitioner never asked the courts below to rule on

he is entitled to direct judicial consideration of his age

23

discrimination claim without prior administrative review.

MS. WAX:

Your Honor, we don't think it did.

2

The court of appeals spontaneously addressed the

3

requirements for suit under section 15(d) of the Age

4

Discrimination Act.

5

did not ask them to do so, but they did.

6

that the district court had erred in saying that suit had

7

to be filed within 180 days of a discriminatory event.

8

They corrected that mistake, but then they went on to say

9

that petitioner's lawsuit was -- his filing of a lawsuit

10
11

It is our view that the petitioner
And they decided

was not effective.
They ruled that both the administrative route to

12

relief and the direct judicial route to relief under

13

section 15(d) was blocked.

14

never needed to consider or address the issue -- or at

15

least one of the main issues -- the issue on which there's

16

a circuit split, whether there is an exhaustion or

17

election of remedies requirement under the Age Act.

18

Because both paths were blocked, they never had occasion

19

to consider what would happen if one path was open.

22

QUESTION:

They never considered — they

How about the first question

presented in the petition, the construction of 1633(a)(d)?
MS. WAX:

Your Honor, our theory of the case is

23

that it doesn't really matter what the court says if in

24

fact their comments or their statements are not

25

encompassed by the question as framed by the petitioner.

We went on to address the issue, Your

Honor, because we felt that this Court wanted us to do so.

But we stand by our argument that at least — we are firm

in our view that the exhaustion and election issue was

neither argued nor decided, because the court of appeals

did not have to decide it.

that the administrative filing was untimely and the civil

That would certainly be an appropriate

Respectfully, Your Honor, at the time that we

We do see

when that administrative process is done.

3

the administrative prerequisites to filing of a civil

action, which all age litigants are entitled to do, save

Our position is

that there's no exhaustion requirement whatsoever.

that even if there is one, petitioner did everything that

MS. WAX:

Yes, Your Honor.
If the Court

does reach the exhaustion issue, it is not necessary for

this Court to decide whether it is sufficient for an Age
