ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE A. BECKMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BECKMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This matter is here on writ of certiorari to

12

review a judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court.

13

judgment affirmed and awarded punitive damages against the

14

Petitioner, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, on a

15

respondeat superior basis for fraud committed by a sales

16

agent in collecting and pocketing premiums from a policy

17

of group health insurance issued by another carrier, Union

18

Fidelity Life Insurance Company, and also on individual

19

policies of life insurance issued by Pacific Mutual.

20

insurance was issued to cover employees of the City of

21

Roosevelt, which is a small town in Alabama.

22

That

The

During the course of the trial, all counts

23

asserted by plaintiffs alleging any wrongdoing against

24

Pacific Mutual directly were dismissed and abandoned, so

25

that the sole basis of the award was respondeat superior,

1

or the fraud of the agent.

2

The major portion of the award went to

3

Mrs. Haslip because she incurred medical expenses during a

4

period which would have been covered by the Union Fidelity

5

policy had the agent not misappropriated the premiums.

6

She was apparently unable to pay the hospital expenses,

7

and a judgment was entered against her.

8

to explain the great disparity in the award that went to

9

her, and the relatively nominal awards that went to the

10

other plaintiffs.
QUESTION:

11

12

And that appears

Now, I suppose we do not know the

breakdown of compensatory and punitive damages here?

13

MR. BECKMAN:

Justice O'Connor, under Alabama

14

law, the punitive damage award to Mrs. Haslip would have

15

been at least $840,000, because the maximum -- she had a

16

prayer for $3 million of punitive damages, and a prayer

17

for her actual damages, plus emotional distress damages of

18

$200,000.

19

The award to her was $1,040,000, so that if we

20

assumed that she got the full general, actual, economic

21

damages, and emotional distress damages, for which she

22

prayed, the punitive award still would have been at least

23

$840,000, and that would have been the computation under

24

Alabama law.

25

The plaintiffs themselves submitted the case to

the Alabama Supreme Court --

2

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Why do you say that would

3

be the computation under Alabama law?

4

under law -- under Alabama law, to give a plaintiff more

5

than the plaintiff prays for?
MR. BECKMAN:

6

Is it impossible,

Yes, and under the cases that were

7

cited, in fact by the Respondents here, that would be the

8

computation of the award.

9

because the actual other damages would not exceed

10

$200,000.

12

And as I said, the plaintiffs here submitted -QUESTION:

11

Are there Alabama cases that set

aside judgments for more than what is prayed for?
MR. BECKMAN:

13
14

are, Justice Scalia.

15

point.

It is my understanding that there
I cannot cite them to you at this

16

The plaintiffs --

17

QUESTION:

18

It would be at least $840,000,

I think it makes sense to say she

asked for so much, and —■

19

MR. BECKMAN:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

— and you subtract that from the

21

total.

22

couldn't it, well, she asked for that much, but we really

23

think that her emotional distress was even more than that

24

and we'll give her even more?

25

But the jury could have said in the jury room,

MR. BECKMAN:

That could happen, but they would

then have been limited to the prayer under Alabama law.

2

And again --

3
4

QUESTION:

Are you going to supply the Court

with citations to establish that proposition?

5

MR. BECKMAN:

I will do that, Justice O'Connor,

6

and I would cite the Court to the case cited by the

7

Respondents in the Respondents brief, which laid out their

8

position that the award would have been $840,000 and not

9

more, because as I stated, the respondents — the

10

plaintiffs presented this court case to the Alabama

11

Supreme Court as an award of $1,040,000.

12

QUESTION:

Does that mean that we should sort of

13

treat the case as though the actual damage -- I guess

14

there were some actual pecuniary damages, a few thousand

15

dollars, too, weren't there?

16

actual damages, and 840 of the other, so it's 4 -- 4 to 1

17

ratio?

18

MR. BECKMAN:

Maybe there was about 210 of

All of the — all of the

19

plaintiffs in the case had a total of economic damages

20

something of about $3,900, and the total award was

21

something in the area of $1,077,000.

22

QUESTION:

Right, but as to this particular

23

respondent, it's roughly -- we can treat the case as

24

though the punitive damage was roughly four times the

25

actual damage?

1

MR. BECKMAN:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

2

Pacific Mutual has petitioned this Court to

3

vacate a judgment of the Alabama Court and the award of

4

punitive damages as violating the due process clause of

5

the Fourteenth Amendment.

6

and submitted here on behalf of the petitioner, I would

7

like to focus my argument on three central issues:

8

First, that the open-ended, standardless

9

Of the issues that were briefed

discretion delegated by Alabama law to the jury here to

10

determine whether or not to punish Pacific Mutual for the

11

agent's fraud, and if so, how much, violated due process.

12

Second, that the system of judicial review in

13

place in Alabama did not cure those violations, and third,

14

that respondeat superior on the record in this case is not

15

a constitutionally permissible basis for imposing

16

punishment on Pacific Mutual.

17

QUESTION:

You say, not a constitutional —

18

constitutionally permissible basis for imposing punishment

19

on Pacific Mutual.

20

constitutionally permissible basis for imposing any sort

21

of liability, or just what you call punishment?

Are you saying it was not a

22

MR. BECKMAN:

23

QUESTION:

Just the punitive award.

You — there's a different

24

constitutional standard for respondeat superior, in your

25

view, when you're talking about punitive damages?

1

MR. BECKMAN:

Petitioner submits that that is

2

correct, Your Honor.

3

damages under respondeat superior, the rationale of it is

4

that where one of two innocent people should suffer

5

because of acts of an agent, wrongful acts of an agent,

6

the principal who put the agent in a position to cause the

7

injury should bear the loss.

8

principal who, as in this case, was in fact a victim of,

9

in effect, embezzlement -— is not a rational basis for

10
11

The — in — for compensatory-

Imposing punishment on a

punishment.
QUESTION:

I guess that argument -- well,

12

supposing you have a corporation, and the president of the

13

corporation does a lot of things secretly.

14

don't know, the stockholders don't know, and you impose a

15

criminal fine for violating the Sherman Act or something.

16

Is that unconstitutional?

17

MR. BECKMAN:

The directors

There's -- there is -- that is a

18

different situation than we have here.

Under the Sherman

19

Act, for example, or a regulatory program, the company is

20

under a direct obligation to comply with the law.

21

in fact fines or triple damages under the Sherman Act are

22

sought to be imposed upon it because of the violation by

23

the company, and the company comes in and tries to defend

24

saying well, high-level management or the responsible

25

people didn't authorize those acts or know that they were

And if

going on.

And the courts have held that if that action is

taken in the course of the company's business, and to
further its profits, the company management can't come in
and say well, we didn't know what was going on, and avoid
liability.
But the situation is different, I submit, where
the agent, even a high-level officer, is affirmatively
acting against the company's interest, and is in fact, as
here, embezzling, or stealing the money -QUESTION:

Maybe they -- maybe they fixed prices

at a level that caused them to lose money.

That wouldn't

be a defense, would it?
MR. BECKMAN:

But they were still acting to

benefit the corporation and seeking to increase its
profits by violating the law.

I mean, here, there was no

possible way that Pacific Mutual could have benefited from
the agent's thefts of the premiums, and those thefts that
were actually premiums of a -- due to another company, but
both of those companies had liability imposed on them,
under Alabama law, for their policies.
QUESTION:

But wouldn't that also -— that

argument also justify saying you can't recover civil -even actual damages?
MR. BECKMAN:

But there you have, again, an

innocent third party and the innocent company, and the

company put the agent in a position to cause the harm.

2

for compensatory damages, vicarious liability has some

3

purpose.

4

had a theft or an embezzlement from it doesn't forward any

5

rational goal of retribution or deterrence.

6

But to impose punishment on a company that has

QUESTION:

Mr. Beckman, do you have any case

7

authority from this Court to support this rather curious

8

position?

9
10
11

So

MR. BECKMAN:

Only the -- the authority that we

have cited in the briefing that has been submitted.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beckman, if I understand the

12

position you're taking on this point, if -- if an officer

13

of a corporation is secretly — secretly favors polluting

14

the environment, and at great expense to the company --

15

not in its interests, but at some expense to the

16

company -- pollutes — intentionally causes the company to

17

pollute the environment, a penalty could not be imposed

18

upon the company because the officer was not acting in the

19

company's interest?

20

That's — that's your position?

Even though the company put this officer in a

21

position where he could do this, you know, put him in

22

charge of all its chemicals, so that he was in a position

23

to dirty the earth, which is what he wanted to do, you

24

couldn't punish the company for that?

25

MR. BECKMAN:

That is a somewhat different case

than those that we have been relying on, such as the

2

Standard Oil of Texas v. The United States case, where you

3

had the three employees stealing oil from Standard and

4

then selling it back.

5
6

QUESTION:

It's different from those cases, but

it's -—

7

MR. BECKMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

But it tests what I understood to be

your response to Justice Stevens.

As I understood your

10

response to Justice Stevens, you think the crucial factor

11

is whether — whether you can impose punishment upon the

12

principal depends upon whether the agent was acting in the

13

principal's interest.

14

line?

Isn't -- wasn't that your — your

15

MR. BECKMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BECKMAN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, and -- and if you're

All right.
If you are suggesting that --

So then your answer to my

19

hypothetical has to be that you cannot punish the

20

corporation.

21

MR. BECKMAN:

I would suggest that's correct,

22

Justice Scalia, and that would be because if you had, in

23

effect, a disloyal employee trying to sabotage the company

24

by putting in procedures which would in fact be causing

25

emissions beyond EPA standards, for example, it would

1

really not forward the goals of retribution and deterrence

2

to punish the company because it had that employee doing

3

that.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

It would deter the company from

putting such a nut in such a position, wouldn't it?
MR. BECKMAN:

That would be direct liability,

7

not respondeat superior liability, if you're suggesting

8

that the basis of the punishment then would be that the

9

company had not controlled or was — this agent, or had

10
11

not properly monitored them.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beckman, we've been questioning

12

you about what you say was your third point.

13

you'd like to get to your first and second point.

14
15
16

MR. BECKMAN:

Perhaps

I would indeed, Your Honor --

Justice — Mr. Chief Justice.
And with respect to Pacific Mutual's basic due

17

process point presented here, Alabama law delegated

18

complete discretion to the jury to determine whether or

19

not to punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, and if

20

so, how much.

21

The Alabama legislature had never established

22

any limits on permissible punishment for conduct, or for

23

punitive damages generally, and the decisions of the

24

Alabama Supreme Court recognized that in Alabama there was

25

no legal measure which limited these awards.

5

damages against the agent himself here?

6

Forget the respondeat

Are there any standards that you could

MR. BECKMAN:

Yes.

One — well, two come to

7

mind, and one that would not work.

If you're talking

8

about overall standards for limiting punitive damages

9

awards, which I understand to be your question, it

10

would — it —I'm sure there is a continuum of solutions

11

which would be acceptable and meet due process

12

requirements.

legislature to take various categories of conduct which

14

are subject to this umbrella penalty, which is a whole

15

spectrum of torts and tortious breach of contract in

16

Alabama, and define the categories of conduct and specify

17

the penalties for those — those specified items of

18

conduct, much as in a penal code^

But one which certainly would be for the

The other could be, and still meet, I think, the

20

concerns which have been expressed by some members of this

21

Court and — with respect to punitive damages, and have —

22

try to have an umbrella remedy, a situation where you had

23

either a fraction or a multiple of actual economic harm

24

caused, which would cause the award to have some

25

reasonable relationship to -- or a necessary relationship

to actual harm, plus attorney's fees, to take care of

2

small cases which might not otherwise be brought.

3

would suggest also a cap, and then the — even the amount

4

of a multiple of actual damages, to take care of the cases

5

such as cited in the amicus brief of the national

6

accounting firms, where there would be a large corporation

where a lot of money was involved but a very small degree

of fault.

QUESTION?

And I

Mr. Beckman, the Alabama court has

10

handed down in the Green oil case a list of factors to be

11

used on appellate review of punitive damages cases.

that correct?

13

MR. BECKMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Is

That is correct, Justice.

Now, in your view, if the Green Oil

15

factors were spelled out to the trial jury that fixed the

16

punitive damages, would that adequately serve to guide the

17

jury's discretion?

18

MR. BECKMAN:

No, Justice O'Connor, it would

19

not.

20

would not remove from the jury the personal discretion to

21

impose punishment on a — virtually a limitless amount.

22

Those factors are highly judgmental, subjective, and

The Hammond and Green Oil factors would not cure

the lack of an upper limit limiting the amount of the

today that the only possible way to meet the due process

2

concerns that you express is to set a dollar limit?

3

MR. BECKMAN:

Not necessarily a dollar limit, if

4

a multiple plus a cap approach were taken, as I suggested

5

in answer to Justice Kennedy's question.

QUESTION:

MR. BECKMAN:

substantive.

15

practice, that has proven to be a meaningless test,

16

because any -- any relationship can be and has been held

17

to be reasonable.

18

about the same time the Hammond case was decided, the

19

Alabama Supreme Court overruled an earlier decision which

20

had required a — a — required relationship between

21

actuals and punitives and adopted a rule that there was no

22

necessary relationship between actuals and punitives.

instructed to consider, which was character and degree of

The wealth of the

10

argument that the award has to be enough to hurt and

11

sting, is going to ensure that there is in effect a

12

multimillion dollar award, even if there is a very small

degree of fault, and — I submit on behalf of the

14
15

petitioner that those factors just would not adequately
control the jury's discretion.

question, and that is that you have a penal code section
which specifies in advance, and says that the maximum
penalty for that specified offense is up to — in a sense,
a — action.

We will take — confiscate the charter of

the corporation and all of its assets.
QUESTION:

Um-hum.

MR. BECKMAN:

Yes, I would suggest that that

would meet due process, but that is different than
punitive damages situation, because there the legislature
has acted to tailor a remedy to a defined offense.
But with punitive damages, you have this whole
spectrum of torts and tortious breach of contract, and
with an umbrella that — that fits it all.
QUESTION:

But the legislature has, in effect,

said for each of those offenses, for any -- for any civil
offense, you are on notice that what you can be penalized
is all of your assets.

Your Honor, in the past -- since

No, Your Honor, I don't think it

In this case, let me make very clear that the

standard of review that was used by the Alabama Supreme

11

Court is much more protective than the traditional, common

12

law standard of review that was at issue in Browning-

13

Ferris and Bankers Life.

14

There, the courts applied the traditional

15

standard of whether the verdict was the result of bias,

16

passion, prejudice, or corruption.

17

Here, the Alabama Supreme Court applies a much

18

more protective standard, and it will explicitly reduce or

19

set aside a punitive award even if that award was not the

20

result of bias, passion, or prejudice, if the award is

21

greater than is reasonably necessary to accomplish

22

society's objectives of punishment and deterrence, and it

23

measures whether the award exceeds that test by an

application of the seven standards in the Hammond Hornsby

In a recent case, for example, the Alabama

sufficient to merit a punitive award by itself, but noted,

But turning to the merits of that vicarious

liability argument, in both punitive damages cases and

antitrust cases and even in criminal cases, this Court has

10

expressly approved vicarious liability without either

11

fault by the principal or benefit to the principal.

12

Again, in the Pizitz case, decided unanimously

13

in 1927, the Court squarely ruled that Alabama, the same

14

system we're talking about here, could impose vicarious

15

liability for punitive damages without fault by the

16

principal.

17

That was a unanimous ruling of this Court.
In the Hydro-level case, this Court even went so

18

far as to adopt as rational and wise social policy a rule

19

of vicarious liability for Federal antitrust cases that is

20

indistinguishable from the Alabama rule at issue here.

21

In Hydro-level, this Court ruled that, under the

22

antitrust laws, a principal can be held vicariously liable

23

for antitrust violations by an agent even if the principal

24

was not at all at fault, and even if the principal did not

25

benefit.

dissented from Hydro-level and did not think that was the

evidence that the punitive damage awards are fundamentally
