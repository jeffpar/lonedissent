ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. HALL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On May 19, 1987, the Supreme Court of Virginia,

11

12

in an order that appears at page 25 and 26 of the Joint

13

Appendix, issued a decision dismissing the appeal of Roger

14

Keith Coleman on the ground that it had been filed 1 day

15

late.

16

immediately sees that it is an ambiguous order.

17

When one examines the face of this order, one

The issues of Federal law that Mr. Coleman had

18

asserted in the circuit court below were the subject of

19

extensive briefing before the Virginia Supreme Court.

20

in fact in response to a motion to dismiss the appeal as

21

untimely, Mr. Coleman's opposition motion adverted to the

22

merits below, the merits that were covered below and were

23

to be the subject of later briefing, and informed the

24

court of its authority under existing Virginia case law to

25

consider the merits to inform its judgment as to whether

And

1

the appeal could be -- the lateness of the appeal could be

2

excused.

3

It is on this basis that we submit one must

4

apply the Harris -- Reed against Harris -- or excuse me,

5

Harris against Reed test to determine whether the decision

6

of the Virginia Supreme Court rested on an independent

7

state procedural ground.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Hall, in the practice in the

Supreme Court of Virginia does that court ordinarily

10

dismiss a petition, as they did here, when they are

11

deciding the merits of a case?

12

MR. HALL:

The use of the word dismissal alone

13

is unusual based upon our examination of Virginia cases.

14

There are several cases cited in the party's briefs in

15

which the court has stated appeal dismissed, Federal --

16

the merits of the claim are therefore not reached.

17

articulation is a clear and express statement of reliance

18

on State law and would meet the Harris test.

19

further statement was not made.

20

That

But that

In addition in this case, I think unlike,

21

certainly unlike any of the other reported cases we have

22

seen, the reference in the order itself to the party's

23

submissions with respect to the merits and then the

24

closing language of the order which states "upon

25

consideration whereof," thereby it seems to me

unambiguously referring to all of the papers submitted.

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Hall, the court —

3

MR. HALL:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

4

QUESTION:

-- unambiguously, as you have put it,

5

granted the State's motion to dismiss.

And that motion of

6

the State was based solely on State procedural grounds.

7

Now this Court in Harris adopted in essence the Michigan

8

against Long approach to determining whether it fairly

9

appears that the State court judgment rests on Federal

10

grounds.

11

to see how it fairly appears that that State's order rests

12

on Federal grounds rather than the State procedural bar.

13

And looking at this order it's difficult for me

MR. HALL:

Well, it strikes me, Justice

14

O'Connor, that there are, in any kind of order like this,

15

particularly a procedural bar in a summary, basically

16

summary order, there are a number of possibilities.

17

are at least two where the court's decision could be

18

informed by a reference to Federal law.

19

kind of situation, where the court in effect makes a

20

determination, in fact does make a determination of

21

Federal law, determines the Federal claims to be without

22

merit, and therefore dismisses on the State grounds.

23

There

One is the Ake

There is nothing in this order that tells us

24

that did not happen in this case, and in fact the case of

O'Brien against Socony Mobil, decided by the Virginia

Supreme Court in 1967, involved an analysis of precisely

2

that kind.

property rights, reviewed the record and made a

4

determination which it described as a holding, the court

said held that there was no deprivation of constitutional

the question of whether the late filing default should be

excused.
QUESTION:

MR. HALL:

12

failure to perfect.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I don't read O'Brien as being a
And the other cases -It's not a late filing.

It's a

Well -- but that's different under

14

Virginia law.

And in this case what we have is a failure

15

to file a timely notice of appeal, as I understand it.

16

MR. HALL:

That's correct.

17

QUESTION:

And the notice of appeal precedes by

18

some 60 days the date when the petition for the appeal is

19

due.

20

to petitions.

And those — the cases you cite in your brief refer
But the notice is jurisdictional.

MR. HALL:

21

I don't believe, Justice Kennedy,

22

that that notion, that distinction between jurisdiction

23

and a mandatory rule is sustainable under Virginia

24

practice.

25

statutory requirement that petitions be filed within 4

As I understand the practice, there is a

6

1

months of the date that triggers the need to perfect an

2

appeal.

3

a court rule which is deemed mandatory, which is called

4

mandatory, but nonetheless it is a court rule which sets

5

the time for the filing of the notice of appeal, and

6

that's Rule 5.9, which is referred to in the party's

7

cases.

There is a court rule without a statutory basis,

8

So although I would agree generally with the

9

proposition that one thinks of a notice of appeal as a

10

jurisdictional event and the timely filing of briefs or

11

doing other things to perfect the appeal as being

12

different in character and perhaps things which courts

13

more typically will extend the time on, I don't believe

14

that the Virginia practice supports that specifically.

15

QUESTION:

Do you have any Virginia Supreme

16

Court case that says that the deadline for filing a notice

17

of appeal is not a procedural bar?

18

MR. HALL:

The closest I come to that is Socony,

19

and the analysis of Socony.

Now, there are other Virginia

20

Supreme Court cases in which the Virginia Supreme Court

21

indicates that it has authority to at least modify the

22

perfection portion of the rules so that it would be in a

23

position to allow a petitioner to file a late brief or

24

petition on appeal.

25

specifically holds that the court has authority with

But there is not a case that

1

respect to a late notice, but it is a court-made rule.

2

This is not a statutory requirement.

3

The best evidence, I submit, is the actual

4

practice of the Virginia Supreme Court in this case,

5

because what we have here is the State taking the position

6

that the appeal is late, therefore there is nothing to do

7

but dismiss the appeal.

court.

And they make that motion to the

In opposition, in opposition the petitioner

9
10

makes out the case that there is room.

11

deciding that motion to dismiss on a preliminary basis,

12

the court takes merits briefs and takes 4 months with the

13

merits briefs, and then enters an order which refers to

14

all the papers and doesn't clarify the basis for the

15

ruling.

16

QUESTION:

Instead of

Mr. Hall, do you have any case from

17

the Supreme Court of Virginia where that court has

18

dismissed a petition for appeal but nonetheless decided

19

the merits?

My point is, ordinarily --

20

MR. HALL:

This case, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

Well, yeah, but you -- you have to

22

get your strength from some other case, it seems to me,

23

because what we're looking at here is something that one

24

thinks of as being peculiar to procedural motions to

25

dismiss an appeal rather than to simply affirm, which is

1

what you would do if you found -- considered the merits

2

things and found them to be insubstantial.

3

MR. HALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, I submit, though,

4

that Ake is a kind of case that presents exactly that

5

issue, and the practice of the Virginia Supreme Court, as

6

revealed in the Tharp case, which is a case in which the

7

court recognized that it had been perhaps too lenient in

8

excusing its mandatory rules, and the Socony Mobil case,

9

O'Brien against Socony Mobil, is precisely that kind of

10

case where the court recognizes that it can look through

11

to the merits and inform its procedural decision on that

12

basis.

13

That is what happened in Ake, although Ake is

14

not a summary order case so that one could go to State law

15

and one could find a clearer answer.

16

here.

17

advert to the Federal merits, to the briefs dealing with

18

the Federal merits, and the practice of the Virginia

19

Supreme Court has been to, in some cases, not in all cases

20

— this is not something that happens in every case and we

21

cannot sustain that argument -- but in some cases it has

22

done this.

23

And under Harris, given this record, the court, to make

24

clear that Federal jurisdiction is going to, not going to

25

obtain, is required to give a clear and express statement

One can't do that

I agree with that, but this order on its face does

It has recognized its jurisdiction to do it.

of reliance on State law, which it doesn't.

2

QUESTION:

You're relying here essentially on

3

Harris, and not on an argument that this was a ground that

4

was applied -- a procedural ground that was unevenly

5

applied, that was applied in this case but perhaps --

6

7

MR. HALL:

We are not making an adequacy

argument in that sense.

8

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

Okay.

9

MR. HALL:

That is correct.

If I might just

10

expand slightly on this point, the — there is another

11

area where this kind of issue comes up, and that is in

12

plain error assessments that State supreme courts often do

13

in connection with the review of decisions that involve

14

procedural bars of various kinds.

15

analysis is a harder case than the kind of case that is

16

set out in O'Brien against Socony, because often the plain

17

error, and typically the plain error analysis involves an

18

assumption that the Federal grounds have validity, and

19

then an inquiry is made into State law, on a State law

20

basis to determine whether there is prejudice.

That plain error

We don't argue, and don't believe that the

21
22

Virginia practice shows that that kind of inquiry was made

23

here.

the procedural decision.

25

Rather, it was an Ake kind of inquiry that informed

1

about Ake against Oklahoma?

2

MR. HALL:

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

3

I'd like to close on the Harris point by just

4

emphasizing again how easy it would have been for the

5

Virginia Supreme Court to state what the Commonwealth now

6

says the Virginia Supreme Court intended to say.

7

had to say was that we have -- we do not reach the Federal

8

merits because this claim is barred by the appellant's 1-

9

day late filing.

10

Any number of articulations around that

point would have been adequate to meet Harris.
QUESTION:

12

All it

They didn't know about Harris at the

time, did they?

13

MR. HALL:

Well, that's true, and —

14

QUESTION:

It makes a difference, don't you

MR. HALL:

I don't think so.

15
16

think?
I really don't,

17

because the question here is not being fair, if you will,

18

to the Virginia Supreme Court, but rather trying to figure

19

out what it meant.

20

the precise Harris articulation is to assume the answer to

21

the question that's before us.

22

QUESTION:

And to say that they would have used

No, I think you would have a much

23

stronger case if we had said that you have to have an, you

24

know, express indication, and after we said that the

25

Virginia court came down with this, which as you say is

mean, Michigan against Long was our jurisdiction to review
a State decision.
MR. HALL:

That's correct.

So -- and there are

12

different values implicated in that exercise of

13

jurisdiction to establish uniformity of Federal law and

14

questions like that than there are in the procedural

15

default area where what you're doing is you're cutting off

16

access to the Federal courts to a petitioner who has lost

17

his rights in a situation where there is some indication

18

that the Federal merits were reached.

19

And in Harris the Court considered whether those

20

differences should lead to a different rule.

In fact an

21

opposite presumption which Justice Kennedy suggested was

22

the appropriate presumption.

23

of having a presumption, which I think is the effect of

24

what the State is asking or the Commonwealth is asking to

25

be done here, that is a presumption when the order is

1

unclear, you assume that State law does provide an

2

adequate and independent ground.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Hall, do you take it that our

4

cases absolutely prohibit us from saying that a State can

5

sometimes look at the merits and exceptionally decide to

6

receive a pleading even though it's late because the

7

merits look so bad, even though in other cases it simply

8

follows its normal procedures and dismisses for lateness?

9

MR. HALL:

I think there is a basis for a

10

distinction in following a plain error kind of analysis,

11

where a State establishes a rule of State law that is

12

based on the concepts of prejudice or harmless error under

13

State law that would permit it to do that.

14

other hand, the court is actually looking at Federal law

15

and doesn't do that in all the cases, or does that in a

16

crazy fashion, then I think there's an adequacy problem

17

that could be raised by the application, and in particular

18

-- in any particular case.

19

QUESTION:

If, on the

Well, what if, what if you just have

20

a rule that we'll always look at the merits, but

21

ordinarily, almost invariably we'll follow the time limit

22

set forth in our statute.

23

merits we see a case that is really — it's clear that an

24

injustice is being done, we then will reach the merits

25

despite our normal procedural rules.

However, if in looking at the

1
2

State could not adopt that?
MR. HALL:

Lots of States do have that rule, and

3

I think it's a plain error rule, and I believe that there

4

is a good basis for saying that the Federal merits were

5

not decided in a case like that.

6

except in the one in which it was actually decided.

In any of those cases,

7

QUESTION:

Right.

8

MR. HALL:

But it wasn't decided in the others

9

because there is a State -- what basically it does is it

10

assumes the validity of the Federal claim and then

11

inquires into prejudice or extraordinary circumstances or

12

something that at least intellectually is separate from

13

the Federal merits.

14

QUESTION:

Is it clear to you that that is not

15

what Virginia is doing here?

16

MR. HALL:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

Why?

18

MR. HALL:

O'Brien against Socony doesn't follow

19

that kind of analysis.

Now, that's my best information.

20

I don't see a case that follows what I would call the

21

plain error kind of approach that this Court has seen in

22

other -- in other cases.

hold that there has not been no deprivation of Federal

24

constitutional property rights, therefore we have no

reason to consider whether there should be an -- whether

we should have a rule that would permit excuses.

3

QUESTION:

That's a

It's an odd calculus that you're

4

suggesting, that is to say if there is a well-established

5

Federal right under the -- your plain error discussion,

6

you assume the State relied on a procedural ground.

7

if it's not a well established procedural right, you're

8

assuming that it, that it looked at that issue.

9

to me that as if you had it exactly upside down.

10

MR. HALL:

But

It seems

I don't think that that would be the

11

circumstance which would cause the State court to limit

12

itself in terms of its harmless error.

13

about a situation where there is a default which under the

14

State rules bars hearing of the Federal claim, whether

15

this be a speculative Federal claim or one that is well

16

established.

17

this is a violation we will then look at whether there is

18

prejudice, whether the essential fairness of the

19

proceeding has been so infected that we should, in spite

20

of our procedural rule, look at this, that's a -- that can

21

fairly, I think, be characterized as a State law inquiry.

22

We're talking

And if the State court says if we assume

Mr. Hall, you raised three questions

in your petition for certiorari, and so far I think you

have just been discussing with us the first one.

There's a difference between this case and the Fay against

surrender was of direct appeal rights which barred him

from collateral review, which barred him from Federal

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15

MR. CURRY:

Thank you, Mr. Hall.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

16

We're asking the Court to affirm in this case

17

because essentially what you have here is a case where

18

there is no question as to the petitioner's guilt, there

19

is no question that his offense is one that amply supports

20

his death sentence, and there is no colorable argument

21

here that refusing him further Federal review of his

22

defaulted claims would constitute a miscarriage of

23

justice.

24
25

We're asking the Court to keep faith with the
reasoning of its previous procedural default cases.

The

1

Court has always struck the proper balance.

2

always expressed confidence in the ability of the cause

3

and prejudice standard to avoid miscarriages of justice.

4

And in our view the confidence has been fully warranted.

5

The Court has

But the Court has also established a safety

6

valve exception, a miscarriage of justice exception to the

7

cause requirement, for the extraordinary case where the

8

defaulted claim is accompanied by a substantial showing of

9

actual innocence.

But an important point needs to be made

10

about what the Court has said a miscarriage of justice is.

11

A miscarriage of justice doesn't occur merely because a

12

prisoner defaults a claim that he could have received

13

relief on if he had preserved it.

14

justice occurs only when an actually innocent prisoner

15

finds himself in that position.

16

A miscarriage of

Now in this case there are very good reasons why

17

the Court should not be concerned about Coleman's

18

inability to establish cause for his default.

19

But you don't have to take my word for it, you

20

can look at and listen to what the lower Federal courts in

21

this case have said and done.

22

case has already conducted the safety valve exception

23

review, has determined that he has not made a showing of

24

actual innocence, and has determined that the miscarriage

25

of justice exception doesn't apply.

QUESTION:

1

Well, what's the situation in

2

Virginia?

In the Tharp case the Virginia Supreme Court

3

said it wouldn't waive time requirements unless to do so

4

would abridge a constitutional right.
MR. CURRY:

5

What that is referring to, Justice

6

O'Connor, is the -- the practice of when a petitioner in

7

subsequent habeas corpus proceedings comes back and

8

alleges that he was denied his right to appeal through the

9

ineffective assistance of counsel.

In that situation

10

delayed appeals are granted usually upon our confession of

11

error, when the constitutional right to effective

12

assistance applies.

13

Those are all direct appeal cases.

But in this case the time limit for a notice of

And what's your best authority for

that -MR. CURRY:
QUESTION:
MR. CURRY:

The rule --- in light of Tharp and O'Brien?
The rule itself says that it's --

Rule 55 says that the rule is mandatory.

And the cases

that I cited in the brief have, both before and after
Coleman's case, Vaughn v. Vaughn, Mears v. Mears, and the
School Board of Lynchburg v. Caudill Rowlett Scott, says
that if you violate one of these jurisdictional rules and
the result every time is dismissal.
No matter what he argued in State court, the
fact of the matter remains that the motion to dismiss was
based solely on his violation of that jurisdictional rule,
and the court granted the motion to dismiss.

They

expressly granted the motion to dismiss without so much as
discussing, let alone deciding, his Federal claims.
And it's clear under Virginia law that the order
would have been different if the court had reached and
decided the Federal merits.

The practice under Virginia

law is to say that the petition for appeal is refused when
it's an affirmance of the lower court's decision.

But a

motion to dismiss, when the motion to dismiss is based
solely on a violation of procedural rule, there is no
other reasonable conclusion than that that is for the

It was these facts that led -- compelled Coleman

the Court had already decided.

the practice in Virginia is, Mr. Hall hasn't cited any

he has formulated it — from coming back and in another
proceeding alleging that first and second habeas counsel

QUESTION:

No, I agree with you.

There's a vast

difference in my judgment between ineffectiveness in the

sense of trial strategy and deciding what claims to raise,

and so forth.

I think your argument has great force in

that context.

But when we've got an obvious error, maybe

the secretary lost the — it isn't true in this case, but

the case, to have it occur as proximate to the offense as
possible.

3

All three of those interests apply here, and

4

they would, none of them would be protected under the test

5

that Mr. Coleman is advocating.

6

those interests is the balancing of those interests in the

7

context of the cause and prejudice standard.

8

The only way to protect

The — if the Court were ever to say that habeas

9

attorney error was cause, something that the Court would

10

also have to consider and would almost certainly have to

11

grant would be a similar form of cause for pro se habeas

12

petitioners, who make up the great bulk of habeas corpus

13

litigants, some similar form of cause based on their

14

alleged ineffectiveness.

15

And I don't think it takes a whole lot of

16

imagination to foresee all the endless variation of that

type of claim, or a lot of foresight to realize that

that's a can of worms that the Court should do everything

MR. CURRY:

Well, I'm sure the Court's aware of

it.
But the point I'm making is if the Court
endorses Coleman's definition of cause, whether you relate
it to the appeal, or individual claims, or at the habeas
trial level, or what, you can just imagine how those
figures are going to explode if every habeas petitioner
whose case is now at an end could go back and file another
petition based upon his own alleged ineffectiveness or the
alleged ineffectiveness of himself, of his writ writer, or
whatever.
In conclusion, again we ask the Court to affirm
the Fourth Circuit's decision in this case because there
is no question as to the petitioner's guilt, there is no
question as to the sufficiency of his offense to support a
death sentence, and because in this case there is no
danger that denying him further Federal review would
result in a miscarriage of justice.
Thank you.
