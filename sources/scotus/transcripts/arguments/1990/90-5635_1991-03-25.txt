ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CERF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

^

We'll hear argument

While an inmate in a Connecticut prison,

12

petitioner was sprayed with tear gas and forcibly removed

13

from his cell.

14

filed a 1983 action against respondents, who are various

15

officials and guards at the facility.

16

referred to a Federal magistrate, who conducted an

17

evidentiary hearing and on that basis recommended that the

case be resolved against petitioner.

1

unconstitutionally excessive force qualifies as a, quote,

"prisoner petition challenging conditions of confinement"

3

within the meaning of section 636(b) of the Federal

4

Magistrate's Act, and is thereby subject to reference

5

without the party's consent.

6

QUESTION:

7

the agreement of both parties that the defendant waived

8

jury trial here?

9
10

MR. CERF:

12

That issue is not before the case —

before the Court, Justice O'Connor.

11

QUESTION:

So we decide it as though there was a

MR. CERF:

That is correct.

waiver?

13

r7

Mr. Cerf, do we take the case with

Now, I don't think,

14

Justice O'Connor, that the fact that there was a waiver of

15

the jury right here is relevant to the argument we make

16

under the Seventh Amendment.

17

that.

18

And perhaps I should address

We think, as an initial matter, that by far the

19

most natural reading of the statutory language is to

20

construe the phrase "prisoner petitions challenging

21

conditions of confinement" to refer to ongoing

22

circumstances or practices, as distinct from a fully

23

consummated, isolated event.

24

common usage, with this Court's use of the phrase, and

25

with the use of the phrase by Congress in various other

We think that conforms with

2

statutes.
Whatever the outer limits of the definition may­

3

be, we think it strains the common meaning beyond the

4

breaking point to suggest that a guard, by virtue of

5

beating one prisoner on one occasion, thereby creates

6

conditions of confinement.

7

But moving to your Seventh Amendment question,

8

Justice O'Connor, in this case respondent has conceded

9

that the magistrate is not empowered to conduct a jury

10

trial at all in cases referred under the prisoner

11

petitions clause, indeed in any case referred without the

12

consent of the parties.

13

because of the rules governing the availability of

14

injunctive relief, cases based on a simple, fully

15

consummated episode, tend to be simple damages actions for

16

which the party is entitled to a trial by jury under the

17

Seventh Amendment.

18

At the same time, cases --

Now, in light of respondent's concession, we

19

think it is just highly unlikely that Congress would have

20

intended to authorize the nonconsensual referral of an

21

entire class of cases for which the jury trial rights so

22

clearly attaches.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You can prevent that by demanding a

jury trial, can't you?
MR. CERF:

I — that is correct.

And

1

respondent's position on this, of course, is that Congress

2

wrote a statute by which prisoners are told that entirely

3

against their will they may have a case referred for trial

4

before a magistrate, never bothered to mention that they

5

could entirely avoid the reference simply by timely

6

invocation of a jury trial right.
QUESTION:

7

But in this particular case, if the

8

respondent is right, it worked the way Congress wanted it

9

to.

Your client had his case referred to a magistrate.

10

He could have prevented the referral by demanding a jury

11

trial.

He didn't.
MR. CERF:

12

Chief Justice Rehnquist, I would

13

question that that was how Congress wanted it to work.

14

think that Congress chose the phrase "conditions of

15

confinement" for a reason.

16

petitions.

17

I

It didn't say, all prisoner

It's — it used what amounts to a term of art.
Now, what respondents are trying to sell here is

18

the notion that all prisoner cases are governed under the

19

case, and we — are governed under the clause.

20

think that's unlikely in light of the backgrounds and with

21

amendment concerns.

22

And we

Again, Mr. Chief Justice, we are not asserting

23

an independent Seventh Amendment claim here.

What we are

24

suggesting is that, as an interpretive device, the Seventh

25

Amendment is quite useful.

And we think that the

1

appropriate test here is that to the extent that a

2

complaint, not at the time that a complaint is filed, but

3

at the time that the case is actually set for trial, seeks

4

and is appropriate for injunctive relief.

5

it challenges an ongoing or recurrent circumstance or

6

practice that in fact is a petition challenging conditions

7

of confinement.

8

9

In other words,

If, on the other hand, the only complaint at the
time that the case gets to the point of trial is that an

10

isolated event occurred, essentially a constitutional

11

tort.

QUESTION:

12

13

I don't think that does qualify under the language.
If you can waive a trial and you can

waive a jury, why can't you waive this?

14

MR. CERF:

I suppose one can waive it, Justice

15

Marshall, in the following sense.

16

one can consent in any event the trial before a

17

magistrate.

18

case comes to the court.

Under section 636(c),

There was no consent here, at least as the

QUESTION:

So what do you interpret from that, a

same — it has same consequences.

1

MR. CERF:

I'm not suggesting that the right

2

can't be waived.

What I am suggesting here is that

3

Congress wrote a statute that says independent of the

4

choice of litigants, it may be referred to magistrates

5

entirely against their will.

6

that is a rather unlikely thing for it to have done, given

7

that magistrates, as all parties before the court now

8

concede, take the position that magistrates are not

9

empowered to conduct a jury trial.

And again, we think that

10

QUESTION:

There's a certain incongruity it

11

seems to me in -- in your interpretation.

12

not an incongruity, but it seems strange at first blush.

13

And that is that what you call a simple damages action

14

based on a one-time thing would go to the district judge.

15

And a major prison structure claim that things are all out

16

of whack at the prison, could go to the magistrate.

17

MR. CERF:

Perhaps it's

Respondents make the — very much the

18

same argument, as did the court below.

And quite frankly,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it rests on some questionable

20

premises.

21

class, cases that qualify as conditions cases are more

22

serious than cases based on a single, isolated episode.

23

It's always difficult of course to rank constitutional

24

violations.

25

prisoner was beaten to death is somehow less serious than

I — I don't think it could be said that as a

even a broad based class action seems to me not to be —

not surprising.
QUESTION:

seriousness of the event, but the amount of discretion

5

that's called for.

6

to allot these cases by the confidence in the judgment —

7

presumably you have more confidence in the judgment of a

8

district judge than of a magistrate — you would say that

if you're trying to restructure a court — a prison

It seems to me that if you were going

system, that kind of a case you'd trust to the discretion

11

of a district judge, whereas you might not trust it to the

12

discretion of a magistrate.

13

^

Well, it's not so much the

MR. CERF:

I think in fact the incongruity

14

implicit in the question is somewhat overstated.

15

example, we're not saying that only class actions qualify

16

under our definition.

17

Congress authorized the referral of all cases, including

18

those based on specific episodes of misconduct under

19

pretrial and the dispositive motions provisions of the

20

act.

21

prisoner civil rights cases are disposed of even before

trial.

all kinds of cases of all levels of complexity.

QUESTION:

Mr. Cerf, can I interrupt a minute?

2

The — you're making a plain language kind of an argument.

3

You say that the normal meaning of conditions of

4

confinement suits your description of it.

5

understand your description, if I have a claim that, as a

6

prisoner, for 1 week I was thrown into a dank cell with no

7

toilet facilities, with rats — abysmal conditions — for

8

a week, and I bring suit about that one incident.

claim that it's general in prison.

But if I

12

suit that relates to conditions of confinement?

13

MR. CERF:

I'm

You say that is not a

I would say guite frankly, Justice

14

Scalia, that that is the most difficult category of cases

15

to get — to categorize, wherein you have what I suppose

16

could be described as a past conditions case under any

17

sort of conventional understanding of the phrase —

18

QUESTION:

Well, why do you say it's a past

19

conditions case?

You say it's a conditions case only if

20

it's on going and continuing.

21

MR. CERF:

Well, I'm saying that as you posited

22

the hypothetical, Justice Scalia, there was a condition of

23

confinement in the conventional sense of the word in that

24

for a period of time one was exposed to an unconditional

25

circumstance.

Under your hypothetical, however, that

1

circumstance has abated and everybody agrees to that.
I think frankly I found no such cases in the

2

3

reported cases.

I suspect that's in part because damages

4

actions such as those may very often shake out in

5

qualified immunity grounds.

6

I think all that would be needed is a rule, and I would

7

err on the side of administrability and say that the

8

cleanest line here -- and again Congress required that

9

some line be drawn -- the cleanest line here would be to

Given the rarity of the case,

10

say that complaints that at the time of trial seek to have

11

tried an issue that there's an ongoing or at least

12

recurrent circumstance, would qualify under conditions of

13

confinement.

14

QUESTION:

Gee, but if clean lines is the

15

criterion, I think -- I think you lose, because that's the

16

main argument that the other side has going for it -- that

17

it's a lot of trouble to draw any of these lines between

18

ongoing and non-ongoing and so forth.

19

MR. CERF:

I don't —

20

QUESTION:

You can say that any complaint about

21

how you're treating -- treated in prison relates to a

22

condition of your confinement.

23

MR. CERF:

That's a nice clean line.

It may be a clean line, Justice

24

Scalia.

25

And indeed I think that goes to the — to the very nub of

I don't think it's the line that Congress drew.

that said, all prisoner litigation may be referred to

magistrates.

4

Congress simply didn't write a statute

QUESTION:

Well, but, Mr. Cerf, in the case of

5

Preiser v. Rodriguez, this Court talked about the term

6

"conditions of confinement" and gave some examples there

7

that looked very much like this kind of case, and said

8

that was a matter of a condition of confinement.

9

suppose that Congress had in mind trying to alleviate the

And I

10

administrative — or the burdens on the lower courts of

11

handling prisoner petitions and letting as many of them go

12

to a magistrate as possible.

13

under Preiser we could give a broader interpretation of

14

the term "conditions of confinement."

15

MR. CERF:

And it would appear that

Let me try to address both of those

16

points, Justice O'Connor.

As to Preiser, there's

17

certainly no evidence in the legislative history that

18

Congress was even aware of the Preiser case, much less

19

that it patterned the statute after it.

20

recall in the case, what was at issue there was whether a

21

prisoner who was challenging the deprivation of good time

22

credits could escape the exhaustion requirements of habeas

23

by filing the suit under 1983.

24

Court held that to the extent the challenge was to the

25

fact or duration of confinement, exhaustion was required.

Much less, as I

And Congress — and the

1

To the extent it went to conditions of confinement, habeas

2

— one could bring the claim under 1983.

3

But because the case so clearly fell in the

4

first category, the court had no occasion to actually

5

define what it meant by conditions of confinement.

6

indeed it the Court goes back and reviews the cases cited

7

as examples in the Preiser decision of so-called

conditions case, I think it will find that all of them, at

9

least arguably, fall within the definition that we propose

here.

MR. CERF:

Well, that's correct, and I think

24

that, again, the issue is not what is alleged in the

25

complaint, because the decision is not made at that point.

1

But after the completion of pretrial proceedings that

2

clarified and refined the issue that must actually be

3

tried and the issue is actually set out, then, if at that

4

point, the plaintiff has set out the essential predicates

5

of injunctive relief, and as he suggests they are, that

6

there is an ongoing circumstance or a reasonable

7

likelihood they will recur, I believe that then in fact is

8

a challenge to conditions of confinement.

9

QUESTION:

I suppose this is a -- quite a

10

routine and frequent allegation in order to support the

11

claim for injunctive relief, is it not?

12

MR. CERF:

It is a routine allegation.

There

13

are many, many cases.

Whitley v. Albers is the classic

14

paradigmatic example where only damages was sought.

15

again, that would not qualify as a conditions case under

QUESTION:

And I -- and I assume you have to

1

because at the time that this case went to trial as a

2

result of the various pretrial proceedings, which again

3

are conducted by the magistrate, it was absolutely clear

4

that there was no injunctive claim left in the case.

5

Indeed, the assistant attorney general had argued

6

unequivocally on pretrial motions that, quote, "It does

not appear how any injunctive relief would be appropriate

to this case."

various prison regulations.

There have been an effort to admit the

them out on the view that this case was about a single

So, again, just to make sure our position is

It is what is the

19

there must be some kind of pretrial decision as to what

21

QUESTION:

In any case on the eve of trial

Well, isn't there one further wrinkle

22

to it, and that is as long as the damage action was kept

23

alive, there could never be a reference in what I would

24

imagine was the run-of-the-mill case in which there's a

25

request for damages as well as an injunction.

There could

never be a reference except at the potential cost of two

trials.

MR. CERF:

Well —

QUESTION:

So as a practical matter, it seems to

5

me what you're saying is except in the unusual case in

6

which there is not request for damages based on the past

7

incidents of the practice in question, there never can be

8

a reference.

10

MR. CERF:
Justice Souter.

11

^

I — that — that's not our position,

QUESTION:

But why doesn't it follow from your

12

position?

13

would be for the court to say, well, we'll take a chance

14

that when the injunctive proceedings are over they'll drop

15

the damage claim.

16

to take that chance, then the court is going to face two

17

trials or the potentiality of two trials in every

18

instance.

19

Because it seems to me the only way out of it

MR. CERF:

And if the -- if the court doesn't want

I think that would not be the

20

consequence, and if I -- if I might try to explain that.

21

Because of background Seventh Amendment concerns, we do

22

think that the prisoner petitions clause is a rough proxy

23

for cases that seek and are appropriate for injunctive

24

relief.

25

At the same time, it is not a perfect fit.

reasons discussed previously, if someone includes an

2

injunctive claim in what is otherwise — what ought

3

properly to be a damages suit — we think the appropriate

4

path is to have the injunctive claim dismissed prior to

5

trial and to treat it as a specific episodes case.

6

And conversely, to get to your example, if

7

somebody brings a case that is a classic conditions suit

8

or is a conditions suit under our definition and includes

9

an associated damages claim, I do think that nonetheless

10

qualifies as a prisoner petition challenging conditions of

11

confinement within the meaning of the act.

12

however, that any imperfections in the fit undermine the

13

basic point.

14

I don't think,

And that basic point is it is simply implausible

15

to believe that Congress would have even authorized the

16

referral of an entire class of cases for -- to which the

17

right so clearly attaches without mading — making some

18

provision for the magistrate to actually conduct a jury

19

trial.

try that claim for damages before a judge.

So what's the

good of trying — being able to try the injunction portion
before a magistrate?
MR. CERF:

Well, the good of it --

QUESTION:

So, in every case where there —

where there's a damage claim, you may as well not have the
provision.
MR. CERF:

I -- again, I — let me be clear.

If

there is a damages claim and no jury trial right, and the
damages claim is attached to or associated with a
conditions claim, we think the magistrate can hear the
case.

That was the point I was trying to make a moment

ago.
QUESTION:

Oh, well, why is that?

MR. CERF:

I think that in a sense you have a

result that's driven by the statutory language.

You have

a statute that says conditions of confinement, and if you
have a case challenging what everybody would agree to be
conditions of confinement -- for example, petitioners
generally are not being given enough food and a subclass
of the class action alleges that as a result of the
inadequate caloric intake they are -- have suffered some
damages for which they want compensation — I think that
the language drives that result.

And I think that would

qualify as a prisoner petitions case.

12

In Preiser the Court decided -- this Court decided that

there was a clear dichotomy between habeas cases on the

Let me ask you this about the jury trial.

is it's somewhat anomalous to say that in order to avoid a

reference to a magistrate that the prisoner must make a

14

impermissible without consent, he could normally get the

trial before the judge.

So that unlike a lot — if the reference is

alternatives, the magistrate, the judge, or the jury.

18

can avoid the magistrate by insisting on the jury, but

magistrate by the district judge.

The Congress really was relying on the sound

14

discretion of the courts to protect those rights, and it

15

didn't distinguish either between important cases or

16

unimportant cases, between big cases and small cases.

17

That distinction would have been equally blurred and

18

difficult to apply.

19

In protecting those Seventh Amendment rights,

20

the petitioner and any other litigant would have the clear

21

right to demand a jury and thereby avoid reference to a

magistrate.

\

This is a case I think that illustrates very

5

dramatically the difficulty of drawing this distinction

6

between a single episode on one hand and a continuing

7

condition on the other, a claim for damages which was

8

involved, and a claim for injunctive relief.

9

illustrates well the fact that there is a process

difficulty with drawing that distinction, which is that

there are reasons of it relating to simply the

arose.

Swygert's concurring opinion in Hill v. Jenkins.

The story of the conflict begins with Judge
Hill v.

10

Jenkins didn't even turn on this issue.

It involved a

11

case in which a magistrate had failed to make any kind of

12

findings or recommendations.

13

Error was found for that reason.

There was no de novo review.

Justice Swygert, in a concurring opinion,

beginning with the word "presumably" and then saying what

he thought this distinction was between single episode in

to other cases or legislative history, concluded that any

other interpretation would be, to quote his concurring

opinion, strained.

true goals of Congress in this statute.

A goal that has

2

been endorsed and articulated by this Court in United

States v. Raddatz, which involved the question of whether

a motion for suppression hearing could be referred to a

magistrate.
\

6

The Court concluded that it could, that there

7

did not have to be a new hearing before the district

8

judge, and that is was the district judge who should have

9

discretion under the statute, because that fit the

10

structure of the statute, the purpose of Congress to

11

broaden the authority of magistrates, to ease the workload

12

of the district judges, consistent with Seventh Amendment

13

rights, because the prisoners could continue to demand a

jury trial and do often.

of the district judge would exist whenever and wherever

there were no timely jury demand.

also the dissent that is contained in the Clark v. Poulton

illustrates the incongruity or anomaly -- to use two words

21

that have been used today — of the petitioner's approach.

22

A single beating case would have to go to a district

judge, but a case alleging daily beating of prisoners

24

would go inexorably to a magistrate.

the judiciary, not the public, not even perhaps of

prisoners, because let's remember that cases would have to
3

be referred if they involved a single episode claim for

4

damages, under petitioner's theory, even where the

5

prisoner himself or herself might want to be heard by the

6

magistrate at the prison.

7

It's very unlikely that the district judges

8

would go out to the prison, but there would be great

9

advantages, and were in this case, to having cases of this

10

type heard at the prison where evidence would be

11

accessible, documents would be there, and the difficulties

12

of going to court and having that same accessibility would

be avoided.

We have cited in our brief the
