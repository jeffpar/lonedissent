ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. THOMAS GILMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GILMAN:

10
11

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is a bankruptcy case where the Court has

12

13

been asked to decide whether an in rem liability that

14

survives a chapter 7 discharge is a claim as defined in

15

the bankruptcy code in a subsequently filed chapter 13

16

bankruptcy.

17

The court below held that such a liability is

18

not a claim.

19

should be reversed.

20

the plain meaning of the bankruptcy code requires a

21

reversal.

22

We respectfully contend that that decision
The thrust of our argument is that

The essential factual background in this case is

as follows.

At that

It's important to note that the first mortgage

7

which was owned by Travelers Insurance Company and is now

owned by the bank has never been foreclosed.

here today that mortgage is not foreclosed.

As we stand
Also, it's

10

important to note that both mortgages contain provisions

11

of signing oil and gas proceeds in the event of a default.

12

On October 9, 1984, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson filed a

13

chapter 7 bankruptcy.

14

that bankruptcy on April 11, 1985.

They received their discharge in

MR. GILMAN:

1

No, in fact the -- in the chapter 7

2

procedure the bank was what we call undersecured, meaning

3

that there was no equity in this property whatsoever.

4

general creditors in the chapter 7 did receive a dividend

from other property that was nonexempt, but it wasn't from

6

the equity in the property that's at issue in the

foreclosure.

The

When you say undersecured, the value

of the bank security was not sufficient -- would not be
sufficient to pay off a face of its note?

11

MR. GILMAN:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
In that position would the bank be

13

entitled to participate with the general creditors to the

14

extent of the unsecured balance?

MR. GILMAN:

MR. GILMAN:

Absolutely.

creditors.

10

Mr. Gilman, now the court below did

not address the questions of feasibility or good faith --

11

MR. GILMAN:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
-- I take it.

And if we were to

13

agree with you that the code allows these sequential

14

filings, I assume that on remand the question of

15

feasibility and good faith of the chapter 13 filing would

16

be open?

17

MR. GILMAN:

Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

In

18

fact, I contend that if the Court agrees with me and

19

allows the serial filing that the matter should be

20

remanded to the district court to take up those issues

21

that the bank raised in their appeal from the bankruptcy

22

court to the district court.

23

The bank obtained their judgment and foreclosure

by summary judgment and proceeded with the sheriff's sale.

20

MR. GILMAN:

That was filed on March 2, 1987,

Wasn't — wasn't that one of his

purposes?
MR. GILMAN:

No, I think his honest purpose was

to try to pay for his land and retain his land.

really no specific reason to delay the foreclosure.

There was

And a shorter time than what his

12

MR. GILMAN:

No question about that.

13

QUESTION:

Well —

14

QUESTION:

But I suppose in a chapter 13

15

proceeding, if its allowed, the bankrupt can press for a

16

reduction of the interest rate and a stringing out of the

17

payment opportunities and so forth.

MR. GILMAN:

1

2

So the -- the foreclosure would just

not take place if it were allowed?
MR. GILMAN:

3

That's correct.

The foreclosure is

stayed automatically under section 362 by the filing of

the chapter 13 petition.

6

QUESTION:

7

under chapter 13 --

8

MR. GILMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Oh, yes.
-- as to whether they should go

further?
MR. GILMAN:

11
12

Do creditors get to express a view

Oh, yes.

And there -- this was a

heated, contested confirmation of this client.

13

QUESTION:

And if under chapter 13, the debtor

14

fails to meet his payment schedule, can the bank at that

15

time ask to be relieved — released from the automatic

15

stay?

17

MR. GILMAN:

It'd be -- it would be dismissed.

13

If the creditor -- if the debtor did not make his payments

19

under the plan after it was confirmed by the bankruptcy

2D

court, the case would be dismissed.

21

would be lifted, and they would proceed with their

foreclosure action and sale.

the debtor's interest, too, considered as to whether the

2

thing should go forward?

3

MR. GILMAN:

In the chapter 13 proceeding, the

4

interests of the debtor take -- have a greater weight than

5

the interest of the creditor, in my view.

6

QUESTION:

Did you say that the -- did you say

7

that the amount of the debts that are listed in a chapter

8

13 petition may be scaled down by the plan or just strung

9

out?

10

MR. GILMAN:

Well, the amount that's listed is

11

the amount that's owed.

12

it's secured or not --

13

QUESTION:

The question of whether or not

Well, just forget it.

This is --

14

suppose it's not — there's no secured debt at all.

15

— it's just a straight chapter 13 proceeding.

It can call for payment of 0

percent of the unsecured debt scheduled and be confirmed.

And does that often happen?

couple of times.

QUESTION:

1

Now, what if -- what if -- do you

2

think the same can happen when the only debt scheduled is

3

a secured debt?

4
5

MR. GILMAN:

That's normally when it does

happen.

6

QUESTION:

You mean -- you mean that -- you --

8

thing there is is a claim against property.

There's no

Do you think they would confirm a chapter

13 plan that let him keep the property without paying

11

anything?

12

13
14
15
16

MR. GILMAN:

No.

It couldn't be confirmed in

that situation.
QUESTION:

No, of course, it couldn't.

Could it

be scaled down if that's the only claim?
MR. GILMAN:

The debt -- no, the debt -- the

17

claim would be allowed in the amount of the value of the

18

collateral and you would have to propose in your plan to

19

pay the value of the collateral —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GILMAN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GILMAN:

The entire -- the entire amount.
The entire value of the collateral.
Not the entire amount of the debt?
No, under section 506 of the

24

bankruptcy code, the amount -- the amount of the secured

25

debt is tied to the value of the collateral.

And that's

1

where we come up with the term "undersecured."

So if the

2

property is worth $100,000, but the bank has a debt

3

against it or a mortgage and -- and a note worth $150,000,

4

their secured claim is only $100,000, and in chapter 13

5

that's what he'd have to pay.

6

QUESTION:

Well, the debt — the debt has

7

actually been discharged in the -- it's just a claim

8

against a property that hasn't been discharged.
MR. GILMAN:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GILMAN:

That's the nut of the issue here.
Yes.
The -- the debt has been discharged

12

and the question is what is the effect of a discharge on a

13

debt.

14

discharge in a bankruptcy prohibits a creditor from

15

proceeding with in personam rights but that in rem rights

16

pass through the discharge.

And it's clear under the bankruptcy code that the

17
18

QUESTION:
through?

I think -- because of a specific provision?

19

MR. GILMAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GILMAN:

23

QUESTION:

25

Yes, section 5 -I mean that -- that claim against the

property is not discharged.

22

24

And why does the in rem right pass

That's correct.
Because of a provision in the

statute.
MR. GILMAN:

That's correct.

1

Because you have to claim here that

2

the claim against the property is a claim -- is a debt.

3

It's a -- for purposes of 13.

4

MR. GILMAN:

Well, I want to use the terms claim

5

and debt coextensively as we learned in Davenport.

6

yes, I do claim that the claim against the property is a

debt and a claim.

13

QUESTION:

And

Because otherwise — otherwise the

claim against the property would be discharged in chapter
7.
MR. GILMAN:

No, a secured debt -- a lien passes

through a chapter -QUESTION:

Well, I -- I know but why does it?

14

Only because it — the statute says specifically that,

15

well -- that it won't be discharged.

16

MR. GILMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
Why do you have to prove that it's a

13

claim or a debt for purposes of chapter 13?

19

reading your brief, I don't see what the -- you set forth

20

statutes' definitions section.

21

operative provision of the statute that uses the word

22

claim or debt?

23

MR. GILMAN:

So what?

I must say,

What is the

Well, the reason we have to show

24

that there — that the bank has a claim is because in

25

order to address the claim in the bankruptcy, the claim

If they don't have a claim in the

QUESTION:

Where -- where is the section?

What

4

is the operative section of the statute?

5

forth in your brief are the definition sections, which

6

are, you know -- they're meaningless.

7

MR. GILMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

All you set

Why --

Well, section —
Where does it say that you have to

have a claim?

10

MR. GILMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GILMAN:

109 provides that section -1 — 109?
Section 109 is the eligibility

13

provisions -- is the eligibility statute, and that says

14

that they have to have a certain amount of claims in order

15

to be eligible for a chapter 13 bankruptcy.

16

the operative provision that you're asking me about is

17

section 1325 which provides what must be set forth in a

18

chapter 13 plan in order to be confirmed, and the word

19

and/or debt is used throughout that statue.

20

QUESTION:

Why didn't your client file under

21

chapter 13 in the first place?

22

MR. GILMAN:

23
24
25

But I think

He was not eligible at the time to

file a chapter 13 because he had too much debt.
QUESTION:

So he first got rid of some of the

debt under chapter 7?

1

MR. GILMAN:

Essentially that's correct.

2

Our -- the thrust of our argument is that the

3

plain meaning of the bankruptcy code requires a reversal.

4

As I mentioned section 101(4) is the definitional

5

provision at issue.

6

phrase that's key in that definition is "right to

7

payment."

8

as a result of the foreclosure or to receive proceeds from

And in addition, the bank

The question of whether that -- whether or not

that fits in the common term of the word "payment" I don't

think is really up to dispute.

practice and commonly understood that collateral is taken

as an alternative source of payment.

17

collateral to make sure they're paid in full or in part

18

and -- and in case the debtor does not pay the debt.

19

I think it's common

Banks typically take

In fact, this Court has recognized on a couple

20

of occasions that collateral constitutes payment.

21

United Savings v. Timbers of Inwood Forest, the Court

22

stated that it is common ground that the interest and

23

property referred to by section 362(d)(1) includes the

24

right of a secured creditor to have the security applied

25

in payment of the debt upon completion of the

In

1

reorganization.

2

Similarly, in Long v. Bullard the Court states

3

that on the 9th of February, 1878, Bullard brought suit in

4

the Superior Court of Bib County, Georgia, to subject the

5

property to the payment of his debt.
And finally, even the Kansas Bankers Associate

6

7

-- Association, who filed the amicus on behalf of the

8

bank, admits in their brief -- probably unintentionally --

9

that collateral rights constitute a source of payment.

10

They say at page 13 on the brief that Kansas banks, like

11

other creditors, enter into loan transactions secured by

12

real property with an expectation that debtors will not be

13

allowed to manipulate the bankruptcy code to frustrate the

14

creditor's contractual right to apply the value of

15

collateral to satisfy the loan obligations.

16

Other provisions of the bankruptcy code also

17

recognize that rights in collateral constitute a right to

18

payment.

19

this issue.

20

provides that a credit or a debtor can propose a plan

21

where he proposes to transfer the property that the

22

secured creditor has a security interest from a mortgage

in and satisfaction of the secured claim.

24

true with regard to section -- or chapter 12, in section

25

1225(a)(5) and in chapter 11, in section 1129(b)(2)(A)(3)

As I mentioned, section 1325 bears directly on
It provides that in order for a -- it

So we believe the plain meaning of the statute

And we believe it

If a -- if an in rem right is not a claim in

section 102(2), in my view would be rendered worthless.

I'm sure -- I'm sure it is, but it

not pass anything that would prohibit my client from

That section makes clear that a claim or an

Also,

I believe that recent activity in Congress

demonstrates that they continue to support a broad

interpretation of the term "claim."

19

recall last terms it entered its decision in Pennsylvania

20

Department of Public Welfare v. Davenport.

21

the Court held that restitution obligations imposed in

conjunction with criminal penalties constitute claims and

23

are therefore dischargeable in chapter 13 bankruptcies.

25

As the Court will

Congress reacted to that decision with the

It's important

1

to look at what both Congress did and did not do.

2

Congress reacted to it was by amending section 1328 to

3

provide that restitution obligations are not dischargeable

4

in chapter 13.

5

concentrated heavily on the construction of the word

6

"claim," Congress did not amend the definition of claim

7

and allowed that definition to remain unchanged even after

8

the decision in Davenport.

9

The way

Even though the Court in Davenport

10

noted the decision in Davenport, would continue to support

a broad construction of the term "claim" which would

12

include an in rem liability.

Lastly, I want to touch on what Justice White, I

believe, keeps continuing to hit on, and that is whether

In other words, he could have proposed a plan in chapter

that the identification of this property interest is

antecedent debt plus interest and so on, collection costs

-- whatever the agreement originally provided.

two, is subject to the limitation of the actual value of

11

creditor after chapter 7, that is -- could have an

12

interest in the value of the property defined by -- the

extent of which is defined by the antecedent debt,

provided that that does not exceed the value of the

property -- the value of the property always being the

ultimate limit.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

just want to clear up a couple little points here.

21

the amount of the -- the amount the bank can receive when

irrespective of the note after the chapter 7 discharge.

2

MR. GILMAN:

So in this case what

3

happened was the amount of the note was for roughly

4

$350,000, but the bank never increased the amount of the

5

mortgage from the original $100,000, and so therefore,

their in rem amount is determined by the $100,000 mortgage

The remainder of the -- of the promissory note
That's in the

Right.

11

amount of the claim is determined both by the amount on

12

the mortgage, which is $100,000, and the amount of the

13

value of the property so that if the property was worth

14

$110,000, they would be oversecured but their claim would

15

only be allowed for $100,000.

16

even though they had a -QUESTION:

17
18

And the 10 would go back to the

debtor?
MR. GILMAN:

19
20

If it was worth $90,000,

The 10 would be equity for the

unsecured creditors.

21

QUESTION:

All right.

22

QUESTION:

But it's determined not by the value

23

of the property at the time of this — of the section 7

proceeding, but the value of the note secured by the

property.

MR. GILMAN:
QUESTION:

The value of the mortgage.
Well, okay -- all right, the value of

the mortgage.
MR. GILMAN:
QUESTION:

But —
But then in your chapter 13

proceeding, you use the value of the property as you -- as
what you have to pay off over a period of time.
MR. GILMAN:

You use both the value of the

property and the -- and the amount of the mortgage.

In

other words, if the mortgage amount is more than the value
of the property, then it -- the amount of the claim in the
13 will be the value of the property.

On the other hand,

if the mortgage amount is less than the value of the
property, then the amount of the claim will be just the
mortgage amount.
I wanted to touch also on Justice Souter's -QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Gilman.

Your time has

expired.
MR. GILMAN:

Oh, I'm sorry.
