ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MS. MATTHEWS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is an original proceeding involving the

10
11

states of New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, and it involves

12

the Canadian River Compact, a compact negotiated and

13

signed by the parties in 1950 and adopted by Congress in

14

1952.

Special Master's Report.

further east is Ute Dam, or Ute Reservoir, which is also

located in the State of New Mexico, and was built in 1963.

And then another 165 river miles further east is Lake

Meredith, which is located north of Amarillo, Texas, and

was built in 1964.

There are two provisions of the compact which

8

are at issue in this litigation to the extent that New

Mexico takes exception with the Master's Report.

We

believe that the language of those two provisions is

critical.

brief.

QUESTION:

Are the provisions of the compact

that you are talking about in your brief?

Yes.

storage limitation on waters originating below Conchas.
The dispute in reference to Article IV and what

3

it means arose about a year and a half after this

4

litigation originally began.

5

had sued the State of New Mexico, claiming that the size

6

of Ute Reservoir, which was enlarged in 1984, violated

7

Article IV(b) and Article 11(d) of the compact.

8

Master has resolved that issue in favor of New Mexico.

9

Initially Texas and Oklahoma

The

Article IV(a) and (b) became a major focus after

10

Conchas began to spill in the spring of 1987.

11

first major spill of the Conchas Dam since approximately

12

1941-42, which of course predates the compact.

13

spill, the water flowed over Conchas and downstream into

14

Ute Reservoir, and approximately 100,000 acre-feet of that

15

water, about 40 percent of the spill, was either released

16

or went ahead and spilled into Texas, presumably most of

17

it flowing on to Lake Meredith.

18

It was the

Being a

New Mexico caught about 60 percent of those

19

Conchas spill waters at the Ute Reservoir, and it did not

20

count those spill waters against its 200,000 acre-foot

21

limitation on below Conchas waters, and the reason was

22

because the spill came from waters originating above

23

Conchas, and under Article IV(a) there was no restriction

24

on how much water New Mexico got to store if it originated

25

above Conchas.

QUESTION:

1

I suppose there wouldn't have been

2

any argument on this point if instead of building Ute

3

Reservoir you had enlarged Conchas Dam?
MS. MATTHEWS:

4
5
6

That's precisely right, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And you could have caught the

7

floodwaters in that dam and nobody could have hardly

8

disputed your right to do that.

9

MS. MATTHEWS:

That's right.

And in fact the

10

parties and the Master in his report agree that there is

11

absolutely no restriction on how big New Mexico could

12

build Ute, I'm sorry, Conchas Dam and capture every drop

13

of water that might ever be generated in the upper basin.

14

So the issue became whether or not it makes a difference

15

whether or not New Mexico chose instead of enlarging

16

Conchas to enlarge Ute, and does it make a difference now

17

that we catch the water of the spills downstream versus

18

upstream behind the Conchas Dam.

19

The result of catching the spills in the Ute

20

Reservoir in 1987 was that as a result Ute Reservoir

21

exceeded 200,000 acre-feet of storage.

22

1988 Texas and Oklahoma filed a supplemental complaint

23

claiming that New Mexico was in violation of Article

24

IV(b)'s storage limitation because we had more than, at

25

least they claimed we had more than 200,000 acre-feet of

water in Ute Reservoir.

2

QUESTION:

But your, you claim that limitation

3

only applies to water originating below Conchas; is that

4

it?

5

MS. MATTHEWS:

That's right, Your Honor.

That

6

is precisely our point.

7

Oklahoma, and he decided in effect that if New Mexico

8

chose to store its water originating above Conchas, if New

9

Mexico chose to store that in the downstream reservoir at

The Master agreed with Texas and

10

Ute, then that water became subject to the 200,000

11

acre-foot limitation on water originating below Conchas.

12

It became subject to Article IV(b) of the compact.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Matthews, is it practicable to

14

measure how much of the water in the Ute Reservoir is from

15

upper, above Conchas drainage and how much below?

16

MS. MATTHEWS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The focus is

17

not on the molecules of water.

18

particular distinction in the quality of the water above

19

and below Conchas.

20

using a doctrine called the doctrine of exchange, which I

21

am not an engineer and I cannot explain in any detail to

22

the Court, but using that doctrine you analogize the water

23

to blocks of water, and it's done in other compacts; the

24

Pecos Compact, the Rio Grande Compact, and so forth.

25

so it's possible, using gauges and engineering

Obviously there is no

But from an engineering standpoint,

And

1

calculations and computer models and so forth to determine

2

with some accuracy how much of the water in Ute originated

3

above Conchas.

4

QUESTION:

Now that was one of the reasons,

5

though, that the Master construed the compact the way he

6

did, as I understand, was the difficulty of measuring the

7

amount of water stored below Conchas that had originated

8

above Conchas.

9

MS. MATTHEWS:

The Master had concern about

10

whether the alleged difficulty would be in conflict with

11

the goal of the negotiators to have a simple compact.

12

we would suggest first of all that there is no evidentiary

13

showing at this point in this case that it is a difficult

14

calculation.

15

it is not a difficult calculation.

16

V(c), which relates to Texas' rights relative to Oklahoma,

17

clearly requires a fairly complex calculation not unlike

18

that which would be required to determine above Conchas

19

water from below Conchas water.

20

But

My understanding from our engineers is that
Secondly, Article

Third, I think that it would not be a good test

21

of contract interpretation to decide that because it

22

requires some engineering calculations that we're going to

23

change and rewrite the meaning of the compact between

24

three sovereign states; certainly not without, not with

25

the evidentiary basis that's in the record at this point

in this case.

QUESTION:

Could I ask, is there any major

3

concern here or any question about water originating above

Conchas that is delivered directly to the Ute without

5

going through Conchas Dam?

the Canadian that originate above Conchas and flow into

the Canadian below Conchas?

MS. MATTHEWS:

Are there some tributaries of

I understand the question, Your

Honor, and in fact the geography here is very interesting
and it supports the upper and lower basin distinction.
QUESTION:

11

Well, is there, but is that -- the

12

same argument, I suppose, would apply to those, the water

13

arriving in the Canadian below Conchas if it originated

14

above.

15

MS. MATTHEWS:

Well, in fact there are no

16

tributaries above Conchas that flow into Ute.

17

tributaries above Conchas flow into Conchas or the

18

Canadian River above Conchas.

19

QUESTION:

The

Oh, so there are no, no tributaries

20

of the Canadian that originate above Conchas that flow

21

into the Canadian below Conchas?

22

MS. MATTHEWS:

That's my understanding of the

23

geography.

24

Report, the appendix, and it's not -- it's a little

25

difficult to read.

the way?

What do you mean above Conchas, by

In that particular watershed?
MS. MATTHEWS:

3

Yes.

The watershed essentially

4

fairly well geographically breaks into three parts.

5

is above Conchas.

6

Conchas and the Canadian River that flows above Conchas.

Conchas is fed by tributaries above

QUESTION:

8

MS. MATTHEWS:

9
10

Um hum.

of which come in below Conchas.
QUESTION:

But they flow into the river, do

they?

13

MS. MATTHEWS:

14

QUESTION:

15

And then you go downstream to

Ute, and Ute is fed by Pajarito Creek and Ute Creek, both

11
12

There

Yes.

They flow either --

They don't flow directly into the

reservoir?

16

MS. MATTHEWS:

No.

Ute Creek, I think, flows

17

about 3 miles from where the reservoir actually starts.

18

But they do flow in below Conchas.

19
20

QUESTION:

And their headlands are below Conchas

as well?
MS. MATTHEWS:

21

Yes.

They're in the lower basin.

22

And then in that lower basin there are a number of other

23

creeks and waterways, most of which, or a number of which

24

rise in New Mexico, which flow then into Lake Meredith in

25

Texas.

1
2

When you say the lower basin you mean

below Ute?

3

MS. MATTHEWS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. MATTHEWS:

6

QUESTION:

Below Conchas.

Below Conchas?
Yes.

So there are some tributaries that

7

arise below Conchas but above Ute that are not dammed up

8

by Ute, that flow into the river below Ute?

9

QUESTION:

No.

MS. MATTHEWS:

10
11

accurate.

12

which flow into Ute.

I'm not sure that that's

There are tributaries which arise below Conchas

13

QUESTION:

Yeah.

14

MS. MATTHEWS:

There are additional tributaries

15

in the lower basin which do not flow into Ute, which

16

flow --

QUESTION:

18

MS. MATTHEWS:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

What do you mean by the lower basin?
Below Conchas.

I'm sorry.

Okay, well then go ahead and finish

your statement.
MS. MATTHEWS:

Okay.

There are certain

22

tributaries which flow into Ute.

24

flow into the Canadian River below Ute and then on to Lake

25

flow into Texas and eventually flow into Meredith, either

2

hooking up with the Canadian River or other tributaries.
QUESTION:

3
4

Right.

So the only water you're

talking about is the overflow from Conchas in flood times?
MS. MATTHEWS:

5

As a practical matter.

We're

6

talking about the spills from Conchas Dam that arise above

7

Conchas Dam.

8

litigation that its storage rights of, and its use rights

9

of above Conchas water are unrestricted as to either

It is New Mexico's position in this

10

quantity or location for three reasons.

11

that's what the unambiguous language of the compact says.

12

Secondly, that language is consistent with the geography

13

of the area, as we have just discussed, and with the

14

historical context of the compact.

15

conclusion simply leads us to some very illogical results.

16

First, because

And third, any other

I'd like to look first at the question of

17

language.

18

restriction of any kind on New Mexico's rights to water

19

originating above Conchas.

20

to Justice White's question a minute ago, New Mexico can,

21

and the parties and the Special Master all acknowledge

22

that New Mexico can make Conchas as big as it wants to

23

make it.

24
25

As I indicated, under IV(a) there is no

And as I indicated in answer

So there is clearly no restriction.
QUESTION:

There was originally a contention by

Texas and New Mexico, was there not, that the 200,000

1

limitation applied to the structure and not to the amount

2

of water?
MS. MATTHEWS:

3

Texas and Oklahoma originally

4

sued New Mexico claiming that the fact that New Mexico had

5

enlarged Ute to be, to have a gross physical capacity of

6

more than 200,000 acre-feet was in itself a violation of

7

the compact regardless of how much water we actually

8

stored in it.

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

MS. MATTHEWS:

10

Now that was resolved against

11

Texas and Oklahoma by the Special Master, and my

12

understanding today is that only Oklahoma still maintains

13

that position and took exception to that part of the

14

report.

15

QUESTION:

But Oklahoma has accepted?

16

MS. MATTHEWS:

Yes, Oklahoma has.

Under IV(b)

17

of the compact, again as I indicated, there is no

18

restriction on the use of the waters below Conchas, but

19

there is this 200,000 acre-foot limitation of the storage

20

of the waters originating below Conchas.

21

specifically what the language of IV(b) says.

22

And that is

From the standpoint of contract law, from the

23

standpoint of statutory interpretation, because we are

24

here dealing with both a contract and an act of Congress,

25

I would suggest to you that the language of IV(a) and

1

IV(b) has to control unless it is somehow ambiguous.

The

2

report found that there is ambiguity in part because it

3

was unclear what the rights were between New Mexico and

4

Colorado under IV(a).

5

ambiguity in reading IV(a) that way, but even if it is,

6

Colorado is not a party to the compact.

7

party to this litigation.

8

ambiguity.

We question whether there is a true

Colorado is not a

It is at best an irrelevant

And I would suggest to the Court that it would

9
10

be very bad precedent to rewrite compacts between

11

sovereign states based upon alleged ambiguities which are

12

unrelated to the dispute that has arisen among the

13

parties.

14

language of IV(a) and IV(b), and no one has suggested a

15

reasonable alternative meaning to the plain language of

16

those, of that portion of the compact.

17

The fact is that there is no ambiguity in the

As I indicated, we feel that the distinction

18

between Article IV(a) and IV(b), and I by shorthand refer

19

to it as upper basin and lower basin, has a geographical,

20

has a geographical basis, and that the basins fall, in the

21

way they are fed and the way the dams are fed, makes sense

22

within the context of the compact and gives meaning to the

23

distinction made between IV(a) and IV(b).

24

about that some.

We have talked

I'd like to move now to the question of the

historical context of this compact and how it is

2

consistent also with New Mexico's reading of IV(a) and

3

IV(b)•

4

In 1950 Texas wanted Federal money to build the

5

Sanford Project, which later became Lake Meredith.

New

6

Mexico had some powerful Senators at the time, Senator

7

Anderson and Senator Javis, and they said no, Texas, we're

8

not going to permit you to get the funding for the Sanford

9

Project until and unless there is a compact which protects

10

the rights of New Mexico in the waters of the Canadian

11

River basin.

12

Sanford Project was contingent upon approval of the

13

compact being negotiated and being approved by Congress.

14

And in fact the legislation which authorized

The parties sat down in 1950 over roughly a

15

6-month period, and they negotiated the Canadian River

16

Basin Compact.

17

Mexico received two things.

18

to all the waters above Conchas without restriction.

19

I think it's important to understand here that prior to

20

that time the waters above Conchas had been fully

21

developed, so that New Mexico, under equitable doctrines

22

of water law, was entitled to those rights anyway.

23

the only issue above Conchas was the spill water.

24

part of the negotiating process Texas and Oklahoma agreed,

25

New Mexico, you will have all the waters above Conchas.

As a result of those negotiations New
New Mexico received the right

Now

And
But as

1

And then the second thing that New Mexico

2

received was protection for its as yet undeveloped rights

3

below Conchas up to the 200,000 acre-feet.

4

important because at that time, though there were a few

5

uses, below Conchas waters had really not been

6

appropriated by anyone.

7

and there had not been a compact, what eventually would

8

have happened is that Texas, under the doctrine of

9

priority, or prior appropriation, would end up with the

11

have had the upper waters, the waters above Conchas,

12

because it had already established rights in those.

13

New Mexico, of course, would

And so what the parties did was agree that New

14

Mexico could have up to 200,000 acre-feet of those waters

15

which originate below Conchas so that in the future at

16

some time it could do the development that it wanted to.

17

-MATTHEWS:

So you in effect said we don't

18

anticipate any need for more water below Conchas than

19

200,000 acre-feet.

20

your needs would be in the future?

21

MS. MATTHEWS:

22

below Conchas, yes.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That was your best estimate of what

That was at the time of, for

Well, is there any possible way that

you could use 250,000 acre-feet then?
MS. MATTHEWS:

MR. ELLIOTT:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And I take it from the earlier part

4

of your argument that the Sanford Reservoir, the Sanford

5

Project was planned without regard to floodwaters?

6

MR. ELLIOTT:

No.

The Sanford Project relied

7

upon all waters, including floodwaters, in excess of the

8

200,000 acre-feet of conservation storage below Conchas.

9

They routed all waters to Texas for the project and they

10
11

were available for the project.
QUESTION:

Does the history show that in

12

planning for the feasibility of the project they depended

13

on floodwaters?

14

MR. ELLIOTT:

They used the floodwaters.

The

15

only thing they didn't do was -- the reservoir is operated

as what is called a firm yield, meaning what it will

supply in the very driest year of record.

Mr. Elliott, how do you respond to

VI of the Special Master's Report wherein the Special

7

Master recommends that this Court interpret Article IV(b)

8

of the compact to impose a water in storage or quantity of

9

water limitation on New Mexico, as opposed to a capacity

limitation.

Article IV(b) of the compact clearly states

11

that it is a limitation upon the amount of conservation

storage available for impounding.

referring to capacity and sounding in capacity is resolved

that at Ute Reservoir at a given elevation you have outlet

you have some quantity of water to the top of the lake.

end?

3

Is it as simple as that on your theory?
MR. LAY:

I think under our theory, Justice

4

Souter, it is simply that once New Mexico has conservation

5

storage capacity in excess of 200,000 acre-feet, that

6

capacity, that excess water that might be represented in

7

that excess capacity is required to be released to the

8

downstream states, because the extent of the stream flow

depletion by New Mexico was clearly intended to be limited

to 200,000 acre-feet.

You might let them -- I take it on
