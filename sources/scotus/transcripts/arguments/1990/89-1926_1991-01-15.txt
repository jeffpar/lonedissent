ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the United

11
12

States court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

13

issued two rulings adverse to the Commissioner of Internal

14

Revenue.

15

discussed in the Cottage Savings case, the Fifth Circuit

16

agreed with the United States that there was a materially

17

different requirement in the tax law.

18

with the United States on application of that requirement,

19

concluding that these mortgage — these pools of

20

substantially identical mortgage loans were in fact an

21

exchange of property that is materially different.

22

That court

First, on the mortgage swap issue as just

It then disagreed

The second, unrelated issue, the Fifth Circuit

23

held that when Centennial's depositors incurred a penalty

from certificates of deposit and Centennial deducted that

2

the depositors were actually discharging their savings and

loan of part of its obligation to them.

4

the income to Centennial was entitled to special deferred

5

treatment under section 108 of the Code.

That meant that

The Fifth Circuit was wrong with its — in its

7

conclusion with respect to the mortgage swap issue, and it

8

was wrong in its conclusion with respect to the section

9

108 issue, and the judgment below should be reversed.

10

The facts with respect to the mortgage swap

11

12

the facts in the Cottage Savings case.

13

Centennial and a trading partner decided to enter into one

14

of these swaps.

16

difference between the two?

8

its tax return, which the Commissioner disallowed for

9

failure to satisfy the materially different requirement.

Centennial reported no

10

For reasons I have already stated, the Commissioner's

11

decision is correct.

12

loans that were given up were substantially identical to

13

those that Centennial got back.

14

borrowers and collateral were not a material difference

didn't consider those significant.

The market also regarded these now-claimed

22

differences as not material.

secondary mortgage market was unable to and did not

differentiate between these pools of loans on the basis of

A contrary conclusion would require overturning

depositors paid penalties required by Federal law for the

early withdrawal of their savings.

to me with that proposition, can I pay it off — well,

let's see.

pay it off early.

You want to pay it off -- no, I want you to
And you say to me okay, I'll pay it off

early, but you'll have to pay a penalty of $200.

11

it's put that way.

12

you call it a penalty or put it in another way?

Suppose

Would that make the difference whether

MR. ROBERTS:

The label you put on it would not

14

make a difference.

15

would not be income from the discharge of indebtedness.

16

It would be income from the receipt of the liquidated

17

damages that we'd agreed to prior to the transaction.

18

key question is whether there is one obligation or two

19

obligations.

20

that you owe me $1,000, payable in 2 weeks, and we agree

21

to lower the debt, I forgive some of the debt, there is

The fact that there was a condition precedent

10

to triggering the obligation of my wanting my money back

11

doesn't alter the fact that there are two separate

12

obligations.
And that's the case here.

13

put their money in the S&L, under Federal law they had an

obligation if they withdrew it early to pay a penalty.

They all say you

This is in a less than 90-day

That's the phrasing of each of these instruments.
MR. ROBERTS:

My understanding — the current,

8

the 1981 Federal regulation provided that if you had a

9

certificate of deposit for more -- the term of which was

10

more than 3 months, and you withdrew the amount prior to

11

the expiration of 3 months, you would forfeit not just the

12

interest that had been earned, but all the interest that

13

could have been earned.

QUESTION:

Well, that's right, but you still get

— you get less than the principal.

is you would forfeit all the interest that would be earned

QUESTION:

Well —

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, here, if you deposited

8

$1,000 for 3 months, and over that time it's going to earn

9

$30 in interest.

And you withdraw it back at the end of 2

10

days, you've got to pay a penalty of $30 in, interest.

11

all you're going to get back is $970.

QUESTION:

I don't read it that way.

But you're

13

telling me that's the way these instruments should be

read?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that's what's provided in

16

the 1981 regulation, which sets that as the minimum

penalty.

seeking to withdraw his funds earlier.

And that's true.

2

The obligation is conditioned upon that event.

statute doesn't say "but for."

4

and that language looks to the source of the income.

But the

It says "by reason of,"

Here the source of the income is the penalty

obligation, not any discharge of indebtedness.

When the

7

depositor withdraws his funds early, he is not saying to

8

the S&L I forgive you whatever the amount of the penalty

9

is that you owe me.

He's saying give me my money back.

10

And the S&L says before I can do that you have an

11

obligation under these circumstances to pay a penalty.

The election refers to when you

You have a choice.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

It points out a further

2

incongruity in the decision of the court below.

When

3

Centennial and other S&L's are paying interest on the CD's

4

that are held, they get a current deduction from income

5

for the interest that is credited.

6

that interest back because of an early withdrawal penalty,

7

they want to spread the income out over time.

8

more natural to treat the two sides of the transaction the

9

same way.

Now, when they get

It seems

They're getting a current deduction for the

10

interest payment, they ought to take the current income

11

they get from the penalties in at that time rather than

12

spread it out over time.

13

Now, the situation in reality is no different

14

than, and the regulations don't prohibit this, that if the

15

depositor wanted to say here's my check for the penalty,

16

give me all my money back, that would have to be permitted

17

under the Federal regulations.

18

back all my money less the amount of the penalty, it's

19

clear that all you're doing there is using the offset as a

20

method of payment.

obligation that the S&L has.

MR. ROBERTS:

What

The motivation for the

It has to be the reason, as the

5

statute says, and the reason means the source.

Why do you

have that income?

7

Is it because I, the depositor, say for reasons of my own

I'd like my money back now?

The reason is because of the penalty mandated by Federal

not like the earlier situation we discussed, where we sit

down and say, you know, let's call it quits for $800.

QUESTION:

It's

regulation?

What if we just agree at the time we make the

20

loan, you and I, that if you discharge it early you'll

21

have to pay a premium?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

Then that would not be —
That would not be income by reason

of the discharge of indebtedness.

It would be

establishing a separate obligation between ourselves prior

to the transaction.

QUESTION:

Now, if we don't have any

Well, there's one obligation until we

21

make an agreement.

At some point before the money is paid

22

over you're going to say okay, yes, you can prepay, but,

analysis if the penalty had not been required by Federal

MR. ROBERTS:

It's clearly -But there's no forgiveness of the

whether you really need to rely on this two separate

I'm not sure that's not a stronger

because it's set forth in the Federal regulations and in

No, because it's all one obligation.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think it's different in

that there are, as I would say, 30 different deals in your

QUESTION:

Well, there are under the

that separate obligation means that the income you receive

I know you've heard a lot about the mortgage

exchange issue, but I would like to make fopr short

11

points, if I could, because we take a somewhat different

12

position from Cottage, and it will be addressed to some of

13

the questions that were raised in that earlier argument.

14

First, we believe the "materially different"

15

phrase in the regulation should be interpreted in the

16

context in which it arose.

17

used by this Court in a series of cases in the early

18

1920's to try and distinguish a very narrow class of

19

situations in which the properties exchanged were so

20

identical that income could not be said to have been

21

realized in the constitutional sense.

22

that phrase is aimed at.

23

Those very same words were

That's really what

Secondly, the Weiss v. Stearn case and Marr v.

is .

Well, I take it, or correct me if I'm

wrong, that income as defined in section 61 reaches to the

full extent of income under the Sixteenth Amendment?

MR. DUHL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So then what those cases say is

relevant here?

7

MR. DUHL:

Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what

That the

Court has said in other cases that 61 stretches to the

constitutional thinking about taxation has changed

dramatically.

Fungibility to me, as I understand the term "fungibility,"

The legislative history of the 1924 statute, the

to solvent taxpayers.

And secondly, the revenue ruling doesn't deal

with our situation.

The revenue ruling simply says that a

depositor who incurs such a forfeiture or a penalty must

separately deduct that charge, as opposed to not reporting

interest income.

22

interest income is accrued as it is credited to a

14

really doesn't have anything to do with situations in

which the discharge, the penalty, the forfeiture, is all

MR. DUHL:

I don't think that's discharge of

indebtedness income, Your Honor, because the Internal
3

Revenue Code has other rules that deal with such zero

4

coupon, no-interest-bearing notes, so to speak.

5

in that case it's clear that the time value of money is

6

such that if you give somebody $3,000 today, he's getting

7

the use of those funds, you're being deprived of the use

8

of those funds, and you're entitled to interest in

9

compensation for that.

That is

And so the growing — the growing

10

amount of principal that has to be repaid, depending on

11

when it is repaid, is really a substitute for interest.

12

And I think under the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal

13

Revenue Service would clearly treat it that way.

14

There

are sections that require it to be treated that way.

And

rr

15
16

it's not discharged at all.

a loss of $5,000, because there's nothing else there.

He is trying to have his cake and eat it too.

He

identical.

Because they were, because they did not change
