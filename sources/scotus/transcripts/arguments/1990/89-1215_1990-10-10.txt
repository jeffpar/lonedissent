ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARSHA S. BERZON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. BERZON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is the validity

15

under title VII of a policy that bans from lead-exposed

16

jobs because of fetal health concerns any woman who cannot

17

provide medical evidence that she is physically incapable

18

of bearing a child.

19

woman's age, marital status, the fertility of her spouse,

20

her intent to have a child, her use of contraception, and

21

how careful she is in using the hygiene practices that the

22

company has prescribed and which, according to the

23

company, should keep blood lead levels if properly used

24

below the level safe for fetuses.

25

The policy applies regardless of the

And the company applies this policy as well

despite evidence that lead at the same levels, blood lead

2

levels, produces in men reproductive injury, including

3

infertility, and produces in people generally

4

cardiovascular disease and neurological harm.

5

Our position is that this policy violates title

6

VII because it explicitly and broadly excludes women and,

7

as such, violates -- basic title VII principles and

8

because for three independent reasons the policy does not

9

come within the only available defense under title VII,

10

the defense that this Court has called the narrowest of

11

exceptions in Dothard v. Rawlinson, section 703(e), the

12

bona fide occupational qualification defense, known as the

13

BFOQ defense.

14
15

First, the policy that Johnson Controls is
seeking to justify today is fundamentally inconsistent
%

16

with the basic precepts and principles of title VII,

17

especially as title VII was amended in 1978 by the

18

Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

19

emphatically in a number of cases, including the City of

20

Los Angeles v. Manhart, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins last

21

term, Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, that an

22

employer cannot disadvantaged a woman simply because of

23

her membership in the group of women — because she is a

24

woman.

who are being excluded because of the policy at issue

2

present no risk to the health of any child either because

3

they have no intention to have a child or any more

4

children, or because they will delay having children until

5

they are safely removed or out of lead-exposed job, or

6

because they will keep their lead levels down, blood lead

levels down through efficient hygiene.

QUESTION:

Ms. Berzon, correct me if I'm wrong.

As I understand your position, that's true,

10

and — and — and I suppose that could be one basis on

11

which we decided this case.
But — but your position really is that it

12

13

wouldn't matter if the policy were limited to women who

14

actually were pregnant.

15

MS. BERZON:

QUESTION:

Our -- our —■
It wouldn't matter for your analysis

17

if the policy said a pregnant woman may not work in this

18

unit.

19

MS. BERZON:

That is true with respect to the

20

broadest of the three propositions that we have before the

21

Court.

22

QUESTION:

Indeed, it wouldn't matter if it said

23

a woman more than — more than 4 months pregnant or 6

24

months pregnant would not work?

25

MS. BERZON:

That is true with respect to the

However —

QUESTION:

5

The position that Judge Easterbrook

took in the --

6

MS. BERZON:

That's correct.

However, I — I

7

would like to admonish the Court of three things in that

8

regard.

9

First of all, there are two other reasons which

10

I will discuss later which would not necessarily implicate

11

a pregnancy-limited policy and which are more than

12

sufficient to require reversal of the policy before the

13

Court today.

14

In addition, though, and quite importantly, I

15

don't think this is a case in which the most extreme

16

hypothetical should determine the issue before the Court

17

in this — for the following reasons:

18

First of all, a pregnancy-limited policy would

19

be -- could be devised in a way that is nondiscriminatory

20

in the first place because if the employer treated

21

pregnancy-related harms similarly to other temporary

22

instances of hypersusceptibility, one might have a

23

nondiscriminatory policy.

24

has done in its lead standard.

25

QUESTION:

That is more or less what OSHA

Are you saying that there would be

1

reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives that would be

2

much easier to identify if it were a policy that applied

3

just to people that were pregnant?

4

MS. BERZON:

Yes, because one could remove the

5

people temporarily.

6

And if a temporary removal of that kind was applied across

7

the board to similar temporary hypersusceptible

8

situations, we might have a nondiscriminatory policy.

9

But, in addition, the science of the situation—
QUESTION:

10

That's not an option in this case.

Excuse me.

Other -- other -- other

11

disabilities, temporary disabilities, don't have the

12

benefit of the pregnancy act which was adopted.

13

doesn't that reflect a congressional determination that

14

that particular disability, if you want to consider it

15

that, is not to be the basis of — of special treatment?

16

MS. BERZON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. BERZON:

I mean,

Yes, but what I'm saying -Unlike that of --- is that if it isn't special

19

treatment — that is, if men who have

20

reproductive -- possible reproductive harm as well as

21

women who are pregnant are treated similarly as the

But it's special treatment with

to prevent precisely that, to treat --

MS. BERZON:

That's — that's true.

What I'm

saying is that that was — would presents another question

And I thought the purpose of the pregnancy act was

But in addition, the science of the situation is

7

such that it is at least unlikely that one would have an

8

injury which in fact affects pregnant women only and not

9

others.

So there are a number of reasons why the

10

pregnancy hypothetical is not one which we feel ought to

11

be driving this case because this involves a much more

12

egregious and central infringement of title VII values and

13

principles.

14

The — indeed, the policy that we

SP'

15

have — actually have before the Court is based not

16

on — so much on a biological risk difference as on a

17

negative behavioral — behavioral stereotype about how

18

women who are faced with possible fetal harm will behave.

19

That is, in today's day and age, women in general can

20

control whether or not they are going to have children,

21

and, therefore, in supposing that they will not the policy

22

is incorporating a negative behavioral — behavioral

23

stereotype.

QUESTION:

Ms. Berzon, I have only one factual

question, and maybe the record doesn't disclose it.

QUESTION:

MS. BERZON:

We —
— or do we know much about that?
We know that it is for some time

6

period after a person is removed from lead exposure, and

7

there are various estimates in the record.
What is not in the record is any precise

indication of how long one has to be in a lead-exposed job

10

before those blood lead levels build up.

11

that's —

QUESTION:

The reason

Well, on the first part of the

13

equation, how many months are the estimates for the

14

removal of the — of the contaminant?

15

MS. BERZON:

Some of the estimates were two to

16

three times as long as it took to build up.

One person

17

said 100 days.

18

whether a removal of 2 months would be sufficient.

19

Somebody said as much as a year.

Another person said that he wasn't sure

20

In any event, at some point a woman who is being

21

adequately warned could remove herself, let her blood lead

22

levels go down,, and then have a child.

23

In addition, the policy embodies a stigmatic

24

harm of the kind that Justice O'Connor said was at the

25

core of title VII in her concurring opinion in Price

Finally, a central purpose of the Pregnancy

practices that, as Senator Williams explained —

wouldn't it?

1

of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, "because she might

2

become pregnant, relegate women in general to a

3

second-class status with regard to career advancement and

4

continuity of employment and wages, render women marginal

5

workers and oust them from the workplace."

6

The fetal-risk policies of this kind — that is,

7

those that apply to all fertile women -- if upheld, would

8

keep women from a broad range of jobs because there are,

9

in fact, a broad range of jobs that present potential

10

fetal risks due to toxics, but also due to disease,

11

stress, noise, radiation, and also to ordinary physical

12

accidents, like car accidents, falls, et cetera.

13

One example of this is that there was a recent

14

study which showed that doctors have four times the

15

prematurity rate — women doctors — of other women, and

16

as we understand the arguments that Johnson Controls is

17

making today, that might well be sufficient -- studies of

18

those kind — to ban women from being doctors.

19

The net effect of upholding a policy of this

20

type, therefore, would be to sanction the resegregation of

21

the work force, particularly because the economics of the

22

situation are that employers•are going to instill fetal

23

protection policies in instances in which they are not

24

dependent on women workers for their work force and not

25

instigate them where they are highly dependent on women

1

workers, because then they would have nobody to do the

2

job.

3

So the effect is that women will end up in the

4

jobs where they began before title VII was passed — that

5

is, in child care centers, hospital nurses, teachers —

6

not because there are fewer fetal risks in those jobs but

because those are the jobs in which they are

indispensable.

upheld, would cut the heart out of title VII and out of

The net effect is that this policy, if

The question, then, is whether Congress intended

11
12

to nonetheless allow employers to pursue policies of this

13

kind within the language of the bona fide occupation

qualification exception which reads very narrowly.

says that it applies in those certain instances in which

sex is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably

necessary to the normal operation of a particular

business.

Johnson Controls argues that despite this

20

extraordinarily narrow language and the vast damage done

21

to title VII, this has to be a BFOQ, because otherwise one

22

couldn't protect fetal health.

I will proceed in a moment to outline the three

24

reasons why we think that that is simply wrong, but first

in its real context as part of the social problem of

3

protecting fetal health.

4

That is, by placing this case

First of all, the issue of fetal health is far

5

more complicated than the employer admits.

To understand

6

why, let's consider two possible scenarios.

7

the Pregnancy Discrimination Act history demonstrates that

8

women work because they have to, and it demonstrates as

9

well and emphatically, and this was discussed at some

First of all,

10

length on the floor and also in the hearings, that there

11

is a major danger to fetal health due to maternal poverty

12

and also due to an inability of women to have prenatal

13

care if they're unemployed, and that those dangers are

14

similar to the sorts of dangers Johnson Controls is

15

claiming here.

17

They are dangers of retardation,

If many employers adopt fetal protection

18

policies, as I've suggested they might if Johnson

19

Controls' principles were upheld here today, the net

20

result will be that many women will not have adequate

21

income and will be relegating their children to precisely

22

those fetal harms which Congress was in fact trying to

23

prevent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

employers protect these -- won't institute fetal

That is, because they are the employers who are

If that happens, women may

They simply have different fetal risks.

A related point about the social context of this

8

case, or the larger context of this case, is that the

9

issue here really, therefore, is not whether fetal health

10

is going to be protected, but how and by whom.

11

an employer is welcome and ought to be protecting fetal

12

health to the highest degree possible, as long as he

13

doesn't exclude women from the workplace, but in addition,
there are two other decision makers here.

Obviously,

There's the

14

15

woman, and there's the Government.

16

The Government in this instance, in OSHA — the

17

Occupational Safety and Health Administration — deciding

18

the lead standard in 1978 emphatically decided, under its

19

own statute — section 38 of its own statute -- that it is

20

not reasonably necessary for employers to exclude all

21

fertile women from the workplace because of occupational

22

safety and health concerns.

23

Interestingly, note that the language of OSHA is

24

the same — section 38 of OSHA — as the BFOQ:

25

necessary.

So what OSHA decided is really exactly the

possibility is that they are being — could be held liable

There were lots

of rules like that before title VII was passed.

MS. BERZON:

because liability as such — that is, the cost that they

So your -- your position is that a

I think that would be correct.

9

the other hand, as I was about to say, we are assuming a

10

level of fetal injuries here that excludes the fact that

11

women are going to act responsibly, and that society in

general, as this Court said emphatically in Parham v.

13

J.R., places in the hands of parents the responsibility to

14

save their children from risk, recognizing that

15

sometimes -- occasionally they will make mistakes, but

16

that if they do make mistakes or if a problem develops

17

along that way, one does not put in the hands of a private

individual the decision whether they ought to be

overridden.

20

It's the Government that ordinarily has the

power to override parental decisions, not the Government.

in effect says that an employer can never exclude a woman

Because the legal analysis if one accepts that

I don't think the single case does.

I think we have to look at the larger studies, such that
the Centers for Disease Control in 1985 made the
unequivocal statement that women of childbearing age
should be excluded from working at jobs where significant
lead exposure occurs.

It was an unequivocal statement by

the Centers for Disease Control, and the basis for the
statement was their study or restudy of the dangers and
the problems with childhood lead poisoning.

I thought we, you know -It arguably should be a defense.

However, bona fide occupational qualification defense
doesn't talk about the employer may do something if it's
required to do it by law.

The question under the bona

fide occupational qualification defense is whether it is
reasonably necessary to the normal operation.

The normal

operation of manufacturers today is to provide for the
health and safety of their employees, the children of
their employees, and their neighbors and other third
parties.
The issue under title VII, going back to the
language of the statute, bona fide occupational
qualification language, is what is the normal operation of
the employer.

To suggest that normal operation does not

include concern for health and safety would certainly be a
strange notion to most manufacturers today.

of injury to fetuses as to actually pregnant women if the

1

concede that looking at fertile women as a whole, the

2

likelihood that any injury would actually occur would be

3

any greater than the level of adult risk accepted in the

4

workplace.

5

And in answer to Justice Scalia's questions

6

about how one should tell how much risk is enough, we

7

suggest that the best test is what does the employer

8

normally accept in the workplace as to health risks

9

generally.

That comparative standard is not factored into

10

the test that was applied by the court of appeals here to

11

the test — or to the test that the company here suggests.

12

In other words, there is absolutely nothing in

13

this record to indicate that adult risks are being

14

perfectly protected, but the company is insisting on

15

perfectly protecting fetal risks.

16

QUESTION:

For example —

Of course, on what you — on the

17

basis of what you've just -- we would have a different

18

case, in other words, if the employer adopted a different

19

policy which simply said as soon as — as soon as you are

20

pregnant you are out of this job?

MS. BERZON:

On — on that aspect of -- that

22

defect in their BFOQ policy, yes.

23

were to cite only that there was that defect and not go on

24

to our broader proposition based upon the occupational

qualification requirement — that is, the notion that

because of the language of the BFOQ, the focus on

2

occupational qualifications, because of the language of

3

the PDA, the reference to the ability or inability to

4

work, the fact that Dothard, as Justice O'Connor said,

5

indicates that the woman's own health is not a

6

safety -- is not a BFOQ and the fact that the PDA, it

7

seems to us, indicates that this case is to be treated

8

like a Dothard case and not, for example, like a Criswell

9

case in which the safety concern was the essence of the

10

business, as the Court greatly stressed both in that case

11

and in Dothard.

protecting adult health perfectly, not to say adequately,

2

but not perfectly.

3

There is -- and contrary to what the company has

4

been suggesting, here there is clear evidence in the

5

record of cardiovascular dangers, neurological dangers and

6

male fertility dangers -- which, by the way, are

7

conceded — with respect to adult health, and those are

8

not being perfectly protected against.

9

In addition, this policy fails for another

10

reason, which is that it does not -- it excludes a class

11

all or substantially all of whom are not within the group

12

that actually presents the risk.

13

here or, if applied here, leads to an opposite conclusion,

14

not for the reason that Mr. Jaspan suggested but because

15

this is not a situation in which it is impossible to

16

individualize the risk assessment.

Criswell doesn't apply

It's just impossible

j

17

for the employer to individualize the risk assessment

18

because the employer doesn't want to ask the private

questions.

The woman, herself, knows what her situation is,

and, therefore, we're not dealing, as I said before, with

assumes that if one went to an actually pregnant woman in

a nuclear power plant and said the following five things

are going to happen to you if you stay in this workplace

and also, for example, provided her with another

comparable job that she would stay there, there is

absolutely no basis for that; and in any event, if there

is one woman like that in the world, we are talking about

an extremely minuscule risk.

In addition and again related, Mr. Jaspan

suggests that this company tried that.

the company didn't try it.
