MR. BOMSE:

14

Nonetheless, while the magistrate explicitly found

15

that neither Business Guides nor its counsel had engaged in

16

any intended misrepresentation or acted

17

purpose, nonetheless, he recommended that both the plaintiff

18

and the its attorney be sanctioned for their carelessness.

19

That order was then affirmed first by the district

20

court and then by the court of appeals over Business Guide's

21

contention that Rule 11 does not permit the imposition of

22

sanctions against a represented party for good-faith errors.

23

It is that question which is now before this Court.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Pretty impressive title.

1

It would seem to me that based on your

reading of the rule you could take the argument a step

3

further and say that a predicate to a Rule 11 violation is

a violation by the attorney when the party's represented.

But there must be an attorney violation before you can even

Well, it seems to me it would necessary

follow if you say that the purpose of Rule 11 is to control

the conduct of attorneys as they control litigation.

15

MR. BOMSE:

Well, it is certainly the purpose of

16

Rule 11,

17

notes say, to control abuses in the signing of pleadings,

18

which ordinarily will be by counsel.

19

— one can readily envision a situation in which the client,

set on some illicit purpose, misleads his or her counsel and

thereby commits a violation of Rule 11.

And I believe that if one accepts my view of the

language of the rule, as leading us in effect agnostic as

to this particular question, then what one needs to do is

to turn to the purpose of the rule which, Justice O'Connor,

7

you observed both in your question to me and in your opinion

in Cooter & Ge-11 is deterrence.

9

opinion, in the same paragraph in which you announced that

10

deterrence is the central purpose of Rule 11, you also made

clear to caveat the fact that it must read with two other

concerns in mind.

is that the objective standard is the apt one for everyone.
