ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BERLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents an important question of

18

Federal law.

19

Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C., section 11341(a).

20

That section applies to a railroad participating in a

21

consolidation that has been approved by the Interstate

22

Commerce Commission.

23

exempt from all other law to the extent necessary to let

24

the railroad carry out its consolidation.

The provision in issue is a section of the

exemption protects the railroad from claims that are based

2

on the railroad's contracts and are asserted exclusively

3

under Federal law.

4

are labor agreements, and the particular law is the

5

Railway Labor Act.

The particular contracts involved here

6

Since 1920 in a series of statutes, Congress has

7

encouraged the nation's railroads to merge and consolidate

8

under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce

9

Commission.

To this end, Congress has given the ICC

10

exclusive jurisdiction over matters with in its authority

11

and given to railroads participating in approved

12

consolidations a broad exemption from other legal

13

restraints.

14

Transportation Act of 1920, was reenacted in 1933,

15

reenacted in 1940, and took its present form in 1978 when

16

it was recodified without substantive change.

This exemption originated in the

CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern are two

18

of today's large railroad systems.

Each system was formed

19

when two previously separate railroad systems were placed

20

under common control with ICC approval.

21

that approval, these railroads set out to achieve the

22

traditional purposes of mergers and consolidations, which

23

include the realization of greater economies and

24

efficiencies through the combination of facilities, the

25

elimination of redundant facilities, the bringing control

On receipt of

of various operations into single locations, and otherwise

2

taking advantage of economies of scale that the

3

consolidations make possible.

Now as part of carrying out their

consolidations, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern

6

each sought to transfer work from one of their previously

7

separate properties to the other.

8

a freight car heavy repair shop at Way Cross, Georgia and

9

another, same kind of shop, at Raceland, Kentucky.

CSX Transportation had

CSXT

10

didn't need to retain both shops, and the facility at

11

Raceland was larger and more modern and it had substantial

12

excess capacity.

13

Raceland the freight heavy repair work that was previously

14

done at Way Cross.

15

Therefore, CSXT proposed to bring to

Norfolk Southern proposed to make a slightly

16

different kind of operational change.

Norfolk Southern

17

operates more than 2,000 locomotives.

Previously the

18

distribution of locomotives — their assignment to

19

specific trains and facilities — was handled separately

20

on each of Norfolk Southern's two constituent railroads.

21

Now, Norfolk Southern proposed to bring all of this work

22

to one location where one of the railroads would

23

administer the work for the whole NorfolK Southern system.

The unions in each case resisted the railroad's

proposed changes contending that these changes were

2

inconsistent with provisions of their existing labor

3

agreements and also that the Railway Labor Act gave the

4

unions the right to insist that the changes not be made

5

until either the unions had agreed to them or the

6

railroads had exhausted the Railway Labor Act's virtually

7

endless process for the negotiation of changes to existing

8

agreements.
The ICC held that the railroad's proposed

9
10

changes were exempt by virtue of section 11341(a) from

11

claims asserted under the Railway Labor Act, including

12

claims based on labor agreements.

13

that the railroad's actions were subject to the processes

14

of the ICC's employee protective conditions, which had

15

been imposed on both consolidations as required by a

16

different section of the Interstate Commerce Act, section

17

11347 .

18

The Commission found

The protective conditions confer on employee a

19

generous array of compensatory benefits including a

20

guarantee of wage protection for as long as 6 years if

21

they are affected by the consolidation.

22

protective conditions also establish a procedure for the

23

negotiation and, if necessary, arbitration of an agreement

24

to govern the manner in which a railroad may implement its

25

approved consolidation if the implementation will cause

4

to the ICC's decision.

And it was that

The court of appeals reversed.

It held that the

exemption from all other law reaches only positive

7

legislative enactments and is ineffective against claims

asserted under contracts.

labor agreements are a form of contract, the statutory

The court reasoned that because

exemption does not apply to them and to the claims

11

asserted by the unions in these cases.

12

Now that decision of the court of appeals was

13

surely incorrect.

Contractual obligations are binding

only because of the law and an exemption from law bars

enforcement of those obligations.

Mr. Berlin, can interrupt to ask you

19

a question about the statutory language?

The exemption is

20

necessary to let that person carry out the transaction;

21

hold, maintain, and operate property; and exercise control

22

and so forth.

23

Is it necessary to carry out the transaction, the

necessary to operate their property, or the necessary to

25

exercise control?

Which of the predicates are you relying on?

QUESTION:

The case would be equally strong

without the labor protective provisions, wouldn't it?
MR. BERLIN:

Yes, it would.

But Congress has

16

shown by providing a compensatory mechanism in the labor

protective conditions which it requires the ICC to impose

18

on these transactions that the statutory exemption is

19

going to affect employees.

20

legislation for the first time in 1940 was part of a major

2

legislative review of the ICC's authority and the scope of

3

the exemption in the Transportation Act of 1940.

4

When Congress first put that statutory

5

foundation under labor protection which the ICC had just

6

begun — recently begun at that time — putting into

7

effect on its own, Congress looked at the entire range of

8

questions that bear on this issue.

had to decide whether to reenact the general exemption

For example, Congress

10

from all other legal restraints, as it was then phrased in

the law.

And Congress did so.
Congress passed up at the time the opportunity

that had been in effect in Title I of the Emergency

about, at what stage and by whom is a finding of necessity

this case rest any of its decision on the conclusion that

MR. BERLIN:

No, it did not, Mr. Chief Justice.

The court of appeals didn't reach the issue of carrying

QUESTION:

Don't we have to interpret the act

3

according to its whole design, all of its sections?

4

what I'm getting at is whether or not we shouldn't really

5

have the Commission's interpretation of 11347 in front of

6

us in order to make this determination.

7

MR. BERLIN:

And

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

8

Commission — well, first the statutory exemption predates

9

the protective conditions by almost 4 years — 40 years —

10

statutorially and almost that much before the ICC began

11

imposing them on its own authority.

12

said when it heard these cases on remand from the court of

13

appeals and rendered a decision under the protective

14

conditions that its decision was — in deciding it was

15

bound to apply the reading that the court of appeals gave

16

to 11341(a)'s exemption provision.

17

decision last summer, the ICC has made clear that if this

18

Court reverses the court of appeals on the exemption, the

19

ICC will have to revisit its decision on the protective

20

conditions.

And in a later

So the ICC sees 11347's scope as dependent, at

22

least in part, on whether there is an exemption out there.

24

congressional action most recently in 1976 relating to

25

employee protection, was done against the background of 56

Mr. Berlin, I have to interrupt, too.

8

You're saying, if I understand you, if you say you must

9

comply with 11347, that that statute is not an other law

10

within the meaning of 11341.

11

MR. BERLIN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

(Inaudible.)
Because otherwise you'd be exempt

from it.
MR. BERLIN:

That -- that's right.

I think it's

15

part of the same statute and Congress expects the ICC and

16

the railroads to comply with it even in exempt situations.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BERLIN:

347 is not another law?
I think it's not, but even it were,

19

an exemption from it would never be necessary because

Congress has said that.

MR. MINEAR:

1

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The issue in this case is whether section

4

11341(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act exempts a

5

participant in a Commission-approved transaction from its

6

contractual obligations.

7

does exactly that.
We based our conclusion squarely on the language

8

9

We submit that section 11341(a)

of the statute.

Section 11341(a) states that a carrier

10

participating in an approved transaction is exempt from

11

the antitrust laws and from all other law as necessary to

12

carry out the transaction.

13

sufficient to embrace those laws governing contractual

14

obligations.

15

QUESTION:

That exemption is easily

Well, one wouldn't have to read it

16

that way as an original proposition had it not been for

17

Schwabacher.

18

law means governing law, not contracts which come into —

19

into existence as a result of that law.

At least that's my view that you could say

MR. MINEAR:

20

Well, with all respect, Your Honor,

21

I think that that would be a difficult proposition.

The

22

reason is this.

23

the fact that they're enforceable through law.

24

actually being exempted here is the enforcement of those

25

laws.

Contracts derive their force only from

2

there would be no need for the exemption as well.

But

Now, this Court recognized as you note that

3
4

principle in Schwabacher, that in fact contractual

5

obligations are subject to the 11341(a) exemption.

6

that case the court held that the Commission's approval of

The same is true in this case.

ruling would be dispositive.

2

that first the Commission must consider the public

interest in approving that transaction —

4

QUESTION:

And it's noted, for example,

It would be dispositive of the State

5

law question of whether they're entitled to 100 cents on

6

the dollar on the accrued dividends.

7

MR. MINEAR:

What it would effectively do is

8

prevent them from enforcing their contractual rights under

9

State law.

10

That is the effect of the exemption.

It

prevents enforcement of law.

11

But the same is true in this case.

12

section 11341(a) preempts the union's rights under the

13

collective bargaining agreements to the extent that

14

enforcement of those rights would prevent the railroad

15

from carrying out the approved transaction.

16

were otherwise many of these transactions could simply not

17

take place.

18

As I said,

Indeed if it

Now, the unions do not quarrel with our basic

19

position as section 11341(a) can preempt the enforcement

20

of contractual rights.

Nor do they quarrel with the

21

result in Schwabacher.

Instead the unions argued the

22

contract in this case should be treated differently,

23

because the Commission, in their view, has no authority or

24

control over labor matters.

25

Now there are two fundamental problems with this

position.

First, the union's argument is to whether the

2

Commission has authority, control, or jurisdiction over

labor matters are beside the point.

13

recognized in Lowden v. The United States, mergers almost

the proposed transaction.

In short, it is Norfolk Southern's position that

that your position or not?

MR. MAHONEY;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. MAHONEY;

No, it is not.

All right.

Why not?

It's not my position because if

21

you had a contract, I would judge, that was directly

22

opposed to an order of the Commission, you could override

23

the contract as the court said the Congress could do in

24

L&N against Motley when they outlawed passes.

QUESTION:

Oh, I see, so what you're saying is,

6 years' protection and money — but it also expressly

QUESTION:

3

Well, to the extent that that

4

governs, I don't think the railroads are arguing that they

5

aren't bound by that.

6

41 permits them to, apart from the guarantees that are

7

made in the legislation, override a contract.

8

position is that if the labor union has an inefficiency

9

built into a contract, it cannot be eliminated by the ICC.

They're just arguing about whether

Mr. Mahoney, can I ask you something

about section 11347?

10

MR. MAHONEY:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I had assumed that the reason it

provides that the arrangement and the order approving the

affected rail carrier will not be in a worse position

15

related to their employment as a result of the transaction

There were a

But I don't recall anytime —

QUESTION:

I see.

So you think what this means

5

is that if there were a, let's say, a station master who

6

would have served at a particular location, even though he

7

could contractually have been transferred but in fact he

8

was serving where he lived, this provision means that even

9

though you had a contractual right to transfer him, you

10

won't — you won't transfer him for 4 years?

11

MR. MAHONEY:

No, it doesn't mean that.

If you

12

have a contractual right to transfer him, you can transfer

13

him, give him seniority anywhere, and he's got to exercise

14

that seniority or he gets no protection.

15

QUESTION:

Is the reading of the section that

16

the railroad and the union can reach an agreement with

17

respect to the effects of the merger on the employees, but

18

that this is a minimum standard that the ICC must insist

19

upon.

20

MR. MAHONEY:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that what you're saying?
That's exactly right.

As in the

original language of 52(f), the third sentence says,

notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties may reach

— this is a little unusual.

it's not like any of the cases that I've read -- Daniel —

11

it seems to me that before one of those can be interpreted

That's correct, Your Honor.

Those are two different arguments

really.

MR. MAHONEY:

Well, the railway -- I'm saying

that the Railway Labor Act as a separate regime is not

11341 unless there's an absolute conflict that can't be

avoided.

QUESTION:

15

MR. MAHONEY:

Okay.
But at the same time if you're

16

going to say that, yes, you can read 11341 that way, then

you have to go to 11347 because 11340 exempts only those

told the Chief Justice that 11347 says that all existing

2

and collective bargaining contracts have to be preserved,

3

and I just don't see that in the section, unless I'm

4

missing something.
MR. MAHONEY:

5

Section 11347, Your Honor, says

6

that they must -- that the Commission must impose as a

7

minimum level of protection the protections that were

8

imposed by the Secretary of Labor for the protection of

9

employees in the Amtrak case, when Amtrak was created.

10

And you go to that statute and you find in that statute

11

the precise sections 2 and 3 of the New York Dock

12

Conditions, which the Commission just adopted, not

13

adapted, by adopted from the Secretary and put them in,

14

and those become the requirements of law.

15
16

QUESTION:

But do those refer to the collective

bargaining contracts?

17

MR. MAHONEY:

They say — section 2 says they

18

must be -- preserve all collective bargaining and

19

collective bargaining rights, privileges and benefits.

20

And section 3 says you must preserve — no employee shall

21

lose any protective agreement like the Orange Book, and he

22

has the right to elect between his protective agreement

23

and the conditions imposed by the Commission.

24

he picks one, when that one expires he can then go to

other one.

That's what section 3 says.

there simply is no power under that to alter the

MR. MAHONEY:

QUESTION:

I thought this case just

That's correct.

You're making the argument that under

11347, there is a specific preservation of those

contractual arrangements.

But all — my point is here that

19

if you say that 11341, or lean to the proposition that

20

11341 supersedes contracts or overrides contracts, then

21

you have to look at 11347, because 11347 — 11341 only

extends protections or exemptions to those carriers.

23

QUESTION:

So we could tell the court of appeals

you could do that, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

We could do that.

5

MR. MAHONEY:

And unfortunately that, we think,

would be a terribly unjust thing to do in these cases,

simply because these people have been deprived of these

rights for 5 years, 8 years, 10 years.

He went back

to the Commission and said, we want out from under this
attrition agreement, and we came in and opposed it on two
grounds and fortunately I raised the question.
One was that you don't have authority to do
that, ICC, and the other was you shouldn't do it anyway
because they haven't approved their case.

And the ICC

said, well, yeah, we got the authority because our '63
court of appeals said we did.

But we're not going to

exercise that authority because they didn't make their
case.
So there's never been a contract upset until
now, until the Commission, who has found this .conflict and
who started upsetting contracts.

And, Your Honors, we

don't want to go back and start all over again on this on
■another 4 years.

There might not be enough of the

employees left to bother with.

And besides that, the

Commission has recognized — in this remand decision, they
recognized that since their decision this has caused such
enormous deterioration in the labor/management relations
in this industry and it has.
And that is one of things that they're supposed
to avoid and this Court said in Lowden that you should
avoid if possible.

And they have created this terrible

upset among these employees and management.
management likes it.

There's no bargaining anymore.
