ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. HOLZHAUER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the narrow statutory question

12

of whether the National Labor Relations Act permits the

13

Board to establish a rule determining that eight specific

14

bargaining units, and only those units, are appropriate

15

for every acute care hospital in the United States.

16

believe that the language and legislative history of

17

Section 9(b) of the act, as well as the contemporaneous

18

interpretation of the act by the Board, make it clear that

19

the rule is not permitted.

20

We

Section 9(b) requires that the Board determine

21

the appropriate unit in each case.

The Board and the

22

unions argue that those words refer solely to the

23

proceeding in which the Board is to issue unit

24

determinations.

25

through the formality of the hearing the requirements of

In their view, as long as the Board goes

1

the statute are met, even if that formality is an empty

2

one leading in every case to the same preordained result.
Of course Section 9(c) already requires hearings

3
4

in contested representation cases, so in the Board's view

5

the "in each case" language, which was added deliberately

6

by amendment to the Wagner bill, adds nothing to the

7

statute.

8

meaning is demonstrated not only by the words themselves,

9

but by both the legislative history of Section 9(b) and

Well, those words do mean something, and their

10

the Board's contemporaneous and longstanding

11

interpretation of that section.

12

The statutory language and its history were

13

clear enough in 1980 and again in 1982 for the Board

14

itself to hold that the adoption of a rule that a unit of

15

registered nurses would be appropriate in every case would

16

be, quote,

17

responsibility to decide in each case whether the

18

requested unit is appropriate.

19

QUESTION:

"inconsistent" with the Board's Section 9(b)

Mr. Holzhauer, we have to determine

20

what the meaning of the "in each case" language is in this

21

context, and it occurs to me that this Court, for example,

22

has an obligation to consider each case on its plenary

23

docket, and yet we search for rules of general

24

applicability to be applied to these cases.

25

MR. HOLZHAUER:

That's right.

QUESTION:

1

Now, isn't the Board doing

2

essentially a similar thing in searching for some kind of

3

rule of general applicability for most cases, leaving, of

4

course, its extraordinary circumstances out if necessary?

5

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Sure.

Well, the Board is making

6

that argument.

7

circumstances exception allows it to consider in each case

8

whether there are exceptions allowing a different result

9

from the rule.

They're arguing that the extraordinary

But the extraordinary circumstances

10

exception, which the Board did not say in its rulemaking

11

allowed case-by-case determination of the — of each case,

12

in fact it did not rely on the extraordinary circumstances

13

exception for the purpose now asserted by the Board, that

14

exception is so narrow as to be illusory.

15

made it clear in the rulemaking that it will no longer

16

consider the individual facts and circumstances of each

17

hospital, and it will disregard all of the factors it

18

regards as critical in every other industry, and that it

19

always regarded as critical in this industry.

20

QUESTION:

The Board has

Counsel, suppose the Board — is

21

this, what, is this the second rule that the NLRB has ever

22

adopted?

It's not much more than the second, anyway.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

24

substantive rule they have adopted.

Right.

That's correct.

And you have no problem with that?
I have no problem with that

because —
QUESTION:

So the NLRB could say in its next

17

adjudication it seems to us these eight units are

18

appropriate bargaining units with respect to hospitals,

19

and if it said that in adjudication it would be all right.

20

Is that all you're arguing?

21

MR. HOLZHAUER:

No.

There are two distinctions

22

that we're making here.

23

that the Board erred by engaging in rulemaking rather than

24

adjudication.

25

exactly the same defect and we would be making exactly the

same arguments if it had been announced in adjudication.

2

QUESTION:

Well, not exactly the same.

You

3

might say it's arbitrary, you'd make the same arbitrary

4

and capricious argument that you make here, but you

5

couldn't say that they're ignoring the case by case —

6

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I would make the same statutory

7

argument if they established a rule saying that these

8

eight units are appropriate in every case, and that we

9

will not consider the facts and circumstances of hospitals

10

in subsequent cases.
QUESTION:

11

But why is that an inappropriate

12

rule, although it is appropriate to say what constitutes

13

an unfair labor practice, to say that every time you do

14

this, every time you do it it's an unfair labor practice.
MR. HOLZHAUER:

15

Well, there are two differences.

16

First of all, the "in each case" language of Section 9(b)

17

does not apply to labor, to unfair labor practices.

18

Section 9(b) says, and only says, that the Board shall

19

determine the appropriate unit in each case.

20

say that it shall determine unfair labor practices in each

21

case.

22

It doesn't

Now the Board has established bargaining unit

23

rules in adjudication, and the Board is now arguing that

24

the rule that it has established in this industry is much

25

the same as those rules.

But that's not correct.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

That's right.

And the Board

3

could establish a disparity of interest test and say we

will decide in each case whether under the disparities of

interest test this unit, the unit that's being sought in

6

this particular proceeding, is appropriate.

7

QUESTION:

And even though it knows that the

8

outcome of that test will always be that there are eight

9

appropriate bargaining units, it must not say that?

10

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I don't think it would ever know

11

that the outcome of that test would only be eight

12

appropriate units or four appropriate units.

13

would establish a standard, and each hospital would be

14

free to introduce the facts and circumstances of that

particular hospital to try to convince the Board that

QUESTION:

It can do that in adjudication, but

not in rulemaking?

4

MR. HOLZHAUER:

No.

It can't do it — it can do

5

it in adjudication or in rulemaking, provided that it

6

allow each employer in each case to introduce the facts

7

and circumstances of that particular employer to convince

8

the Board that in that case that rule should not apply.

9

The "in each case" language requires case-by-case

10

evaluation of the appropriateness of the particular

11

bargaining unit.

QUESTION:

12

13
14

That's what we're arguing.
Without any general principles at

all?
MR. HOLZHAUER:

Oh yes, it can establish general

15

principles.

16

principles that it has established in other industries.

17

In fact it can establish the same kinds of

QUESTION:

But it can't -- it can't establish a

18

rule that is conclusive, regardless of the facts of a

19

particular case?

20

MR. HOLZHAUER:

That's right.

That's right.

21

What the Board has done here is it has said that, first of

22

all it said in its rulemaking that all of the — that as

23

to all of these factors it lists in its extraordinary

But to

1

the extent they do, we find that we're better off ignoring

2

those variations, because the value of having a uniform

3

rule outweighs the value of considering in each case

4

whether that bargaining unit is appropriate.
We don't think that's proper.

5

We think the

6

Board has to look at the facts and circumstances of each

case to decide whether its rule is properly applied to

8

that case.
QUESTION:

9

Does that mean simply that the Board

10

can't have a conclusive presumption in the interest of

11

administrative efficiency?
MR. HOLZHAUER:

12

13

That's correct.

It cannot have

a —

14

QUESTION:

Does it mean anything more than that?

15

MR. HOLZHAUER:

It can't have an exclusive

16

presumption, period, no matter what the interest is.

The

17

Board has — the Congress has determined by putting in

18

this "in each case" language, which otherwise would be

19

completely redundant and meaningless, that the Board must

20

consider the facts and circumstances of each case, as long

21

as they do that.

22

Now, the Board has, has argued or has written

23

over the years that that's exactly what, what this rule

24

requires.

25

and in 1935, when the act was first being considered,

It said so in adjudications in 1980 and 1982,

And in each case you

would think that they would be allowed to make that

12

Sure.

So the language of the statute itself

helps you in that respect?

13

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I think that's correct.

It also

is helped by the fact that the extent of organization is

not supposed to be conclusive.

QUESTION:

1

If, if the Board in 50 separate cases

2

had heard employers' evidence to this effect, and in every

3

single case it had said well, this evidence just doesn't

4

change our minds, it couldn't at the end of those 50 cases

5

adopt some general principle?
MR. HOLZHAUER:

6

It could adopt a general

7

principle saying that we might presume that all of these

8

units will be appropriate units, but the Board — the

9

employer or other parties before the Board would still

10

have to have the opportunity in each case to convince the

11

Board that that unit is appropriate.

12

what the Board does in every other industry.
QUESTION:

And that's exactly

Well, would the Board have standards

14

of relevancy that it could impose?

make any difference.

It could say we're not

Well, I think there would be

19

some problem if the Board were saying that this is just

20

the standard of relevance.

21

point out first that that's not what the Board has done

22

here.

23

It found instead that for the most part hospitals don't

vary in the various respects that the Board talked about,

25

and that to the extent they do vary, which they

I think it's important to

It didn't find that these factors are irrelevant.

1

acknowledged, the value of having a uniform rule

2

outweighed the value of considering those factors.

3

If the Board had determined that all of the

4

factors that it always considers in every other industry

5

were irrelevant and didn't change its mind, I don't think

6

that determination, frankly, could survive scrutiny.

7

These are the factors that the Board considers relevant in

8

every other industry, and that it has considered relevant

9

in hospital cases for the last 17 years.

In case after

10

case applying these factors, the Board has found that one

11

or another of the units that are now before it and that

12

are now deemed to be appropriate in every case, were in

13

fact inappropriate, and have held that those units would

14

not be allowed.

15

Now, for them to suddenly, after making all

16

these decisions over the years under both the disparity of

17

interest standard and the community of interest standard,

18

for them to suddenly decide no, these are no longer

19

relevant, I don't think that could survive scrutiny.

20

But that's not what they have done in this case.

21

What they have done in this case is say they don't vary in

22

these respects, mostly, but to the extent they do vary in

23

these respects we're not going to consider that.

24

longer think that that variation is something we have to

think about.

You're really saying that the rule

appropriate unit is?

10

MR. HOLZHAUER:

It does.

Exactly.

It refuses

11

to decide — well, to consider the facts and circumstances

12

of a particular hospital in deciding whether one of the

13

eight units is appropriate.

Well, I know, but I suppose the Board

15

would say well, if we -- if we really didn't care about

things like that we would decide this particular case

18

differently, but we value whatever it is we're valuing so

19

much that we will disregard that otherwise we would find

20

this unit to be inappropriate.

21

MR. HOLZHAUER:

That's correct.

That's correct.

The Board has decided that the value of uniformity, the

value, the efficiency that comes from uniformity, and

that's what it says in its rulemaking, outweighs the

So

Well, let me respond in two

10

different ways.

First of all, the "in each case"

requirement requires case-by-case consideration of

bargaining units, and if the American Hospital Association

took a contrary position and made an argument that is

contrary to what the statute means, the American Hospital

emphasized in its rulemaking that it was not merely

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
After 13 years of extensive controversy,

10

uncertainty, delay, and expense, the Labor Board decided

11

to initiate a rulemaking proceeding on the vexing question

12

of unit determinations in the health care industry.

13

some 2 years, which included two very extensive notices of

14

proposed rulemaking, a number of significant modifications

15

in the proposed rule, consideration of some 3,500 pages of

16

testimony from over 140 witnesses, and 1,800 written

17

submissions, the Board formulated its final rule,

18

specifying the types of bargaining units that in the

19

absence of extraordinary circumstances would be considered

20

appropriate on the filing of a proper petition for most

21

acute care hospitals.

22

I sure doubt, parenthetically, as Mr. Holzhauer

23

has mentioned, that the rule specifically contemplates the

24

possibility of a union petition for a combination of

25

units, and in that sense the regulation is significant in

Your comment that this is a ceiling

17

on the number of groups, because there can be fewer groups

by the employer in that determination, and that, I take

20

it, and I take it also that that is inconsistent with the

21

Board's rule in all other areas, where the employer has a

22

voice.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the employer -- I think it's

24

important to establish at the outset that the employer's

25

role in the petitioning process is a very limited one.

It

is the union as the representative of the employees that

2

chooses the bargaining unit to be sought through petition.

3

The only time that an employer is authorized to petition

under the act is when confronted with a union demand for

recognition.

6

understanding is that by withdrawing the demand the union

7

can effectively boot that petition.

a route that allows the union, as the representative of

the employees, to seem an appropriate unit.

QUESTION:

What do the "in each case"

12

requirement, what obligation does that impose on the

13

Board, Mr. Shapiro?

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, we think the

15

obligation of the "in each case" requirement is an

16

obligation to apply whatever standards and rules may exist

17

in the context of a particular proceeding to determine the

18

appropriate unit.

19

If you go back to the history of the 1935

20

legislation, the "in each case" language was one of a

21

number of amendments proposed by Secretary of Labor

22

Bergens as she described it for the sake of clarity.

23

clarification may not have been essential, but it was

24

helpful because the very specific petition requirement of

25

Section 9(c), which the Board later developed and which

That

1

now appears in Section 9(c), was not a part of the

2

original act.

3

vaguer about how the process worked, and in that context

4

we believe the "in each case" provision was a useful one.

5

We do not believe that that clarifying language

The original Section 9(c) was a good deal

6

should be given the radical and very destructive

7

definition that petitioner would give it here.

8

not preclude the Board from formulating rules of decision

9

that facilitate a determination that in a particular case

It does

there is no genuine issue of material fact.

case.

13

It does not

Now, this argument, we believe, has two very

14

strong supports.

One is that very similar arguments have

15

over the past 35 years been rejected by this Court in a

16

series of decisions beginning with Storer Broadcasting

17

back in the 1950's.

18

that particular regulations cannot survive challenge, not

19

because they clash with some substantive provision of law,

20

but because they are at odds with the statutory

21

requirement of an opportunity for a hearing or a statutory

22

requirement of a individualized determination.

23

has repeatedly rejected those challenges on the grounds

24

they do not undermine the fundamental administrative

25

authority to formulate rules of decision.

The argument has been repeatedly made

This Court

It did so in

1

the Storer case in the 1950's, in the Texaco case in the

2

1960's --

3

QUESTION:

Was there similar language in the

4

Communications Act to the "in each case" language in the

5

Labor Act?

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

In a way it seems to me, Your

7

Honor, that there was stronger language, because in the

8

Communications Act the statute said that if the agency

9

cannot decide that a particular application, a particular

10

license, would be in the public interest, then it was

11

required to set the case for hearing.

12

Now what the communications decision —

13

commission did was to say that if a station owner already

14

owned five stations, he could not get a sixth.

15

flat rule.

16

rule in a sense facilitated, permitted summary judgment.

17

If a station owner already had five stations, there was no

18

genuine issue of material fact that required a hearing.

19

That was a

There was a waiver procedure provided, but the

This language,

"in each case," says nothing

20

about a requirement of a hearing, and does not address the

21

sources of law to be applied in each case.

22

Now the, the precedent of the Storer case has

23

been repeatedly applied by this Court, ^in Texaco in the

24

1960's, more recently in WNCN, in Heckler and Campbell,

25

and just last month in the Mobile case.

So not only is

1

there a long line of precedent in this Court, there is

2

also, we believe, a consistent view of the Labor Board

3

that squares with its position in this proceeding.

4

QUESTION:

What were the circumstances, or what

5

was the reason that the Board undertook this rulemaking

6

and arrived at this result, rather than doing what it did

7

for 13 years?

8

9

MR. SHAPIRO:
of reasons, Your Honor.

Well, I think there were a number
I think one was that the Board

10

had had a good deal of difficulty both understanding the

11

industry, acquiring enough information, and in persuading

12

the courts of appeals that it was acting consistently with

13

its legal obligations.

14

The courts of appeals were widely divided on

15

what those obligations were, very widely divided, but they

16

all did seem to agree on one thing, and that is that the

17

Board had to address the problem as a distinctive problem

18

in a distinctive way.

19

responding to that and to its very acute need for more

20

information by undertaking this proceeding.

21

And I think the Board was both

I also believe that part of what the Board was

22

doing was an echo of what it tried to do in the first St.

23

Francis case, that is the Board was mindful of the

24

admonition in the 1974 committee reports that there should

25

not be too many bargaining units, and one thing it tried

1

to do in its first St. Francis case was to set a ceiling

2

on the number of bargaining units that would be authorized

3

in the industry to prevent the kind of balkanization that

4

had occurred in the construction industry, which is an

5

industry that had a very large number of different skills

6

and crafts, very much like a hospital industry.

7
8

believe, and a very significant one, was to establish a

9

cap on the number of units which would apply in each case.

argument that Mr. Holzhauer just made.

19

was motivating the Board — the Board here, and what it

20

made very clear in its lengthy opinions, was a desire to

determine whether despite the variations among hospitals

22

they had enough in common so that as a matter of law they

23

should be treated alike.

They recognize that no two hospitals are alike,

just as no two fingerprints are alike, no two people are

The question remains whether a valid legal

Now, I think it's probably true, Your Honor,

that as a result of the rule individual cases might be

MR. SHAPIRO:

What is traded off is perhaps

certain marginal cases where a particular proceeding might

be decided differently in the sense that a given unit was

19

inappropriate, and yet it doesn't qualify for the

20

extraordinary circumstances exception and is governed by

21

the rule.

22

QUESTION:

Well, in that kind of a case is the

23

Board really acting consistent with the direction to

24

decide in that particular case what unit is appropriate?

Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor,

because I — I believe that the "in each case" requirement

does not stand in the way of the Board's articulating

rules that are to be applied in each case.

case, the Board articulated a number of rules that it had

developed.

Some of those rules were conclusive rules.

conclusive rule that supervisors would never be put into

The Board would have to find that

Yes.

The Board might not

Preclude that finding, because the

regulation allows a union to seek a combination.

So that in each case there might be

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HOLZHAUER:

Yes.

Thank you.

It's

interesting that the Board refers here to the first St.
Francis case, and says that it is basically trying to
reestablish the first St. Francis approach.

In that first

St. Francis case the Board held that the in each case
language of Section 9(b) precludes the kind of presumption
that it had in the past that a nurses unit, an R.N. unit,
would be appropriate in each and every case.
What this rule does is it says if a union comes
and asks for any one of these eight units, that unit is
appropriate.

Period.

The employer cannot offer facts and

circumstances of a particular employer, or a particular
workplace, or a grouping of employees to rebut that
presumption.
QUESTION:

Will the Board inevitably accept the

union's choice?
MR. HOLZHAUER:
union's choice.

The Board will accept the

Yes.

QUESTION:

Inevitably?

MR. HOLZHAUER:

The only time when the Board

will not accept the union's choice is if it's inconsistent
with these eight units.
Frankly, I think that's as wrong -QUESTION:

What if they -- what if the union -50

But it

Even though they group these, what

13

would otherwise be separate units?

14

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Right.

Combined units will be

regarded as ordinarily appropriate, but not always

appropriate, when requested by the union.

be regarded as appropriate when the employer makes that

kind of request.

it has always done in this industry, and says this unit is

issues that they are going to consider, don't go really to

of the Joint Appendix where the Board describes the
