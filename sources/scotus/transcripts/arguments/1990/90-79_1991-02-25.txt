ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DYK:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

14

This case presents an important question under

15

Section 1988 of the civil rights laws which allows a

16

reasonable attorney's fee to prevailing parties.

17

Petitioner in this case is an attorney who, proceeding pro

18

se in the United States district court for the Eastern

19

District of Kentucky, succeeded in having two state

20

statutes restricting access to the ballot declared

21

unconstitutional.

22

unconstitutional 4 years earlier and it had been reenacted

23

by the State in its identical form despite the court's

24

ruling.

25

QUESTION:

And one of those had been declared

What was the standing in this case?

MR. DYK:

QUESTION:

MR. DYK:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DYK:

In this case?
In this case, yeah.
He was a —
Was he a candidate or something?
Yes.

He was a candidate for President

6

of the United States.

7

the Democratic ticket a number of times, and has received

8

access to the ballot in a number of States and a fair

9

amount of media coverage for a minor party candidate, and

10

He has run for various offices on

for a minor candidate for the Democratic nomination.

11

He, in doing this, fulfilled the purposes of the

12

civil rights laws, and that is he acted as a private

13

attorney general vindicating not only his own rights,

14

representing not only his own rights, but those of other

15

people in the United States.

16

QUESTION:

Was it ever established, Mr. Dyk,

17

that he was admitted to the bar in the Eastern District of

18

Kentucky, or Western District, wherever it was?

19

MR. DYK:

He didn't need to be admitted to the

20

bar pro hac vice.

He was not a regular member of the bar,

21

but he did not need to seek a pro hac vice admission

22

because under the rules of the Eastern District he was

23

allowed to proceed without doing that since he was pro se.

24

He is a member of the bar of the States of Florida and

25

Ohio.

QUESTION:

So he was enabled to proceed in

2

Kentucky not because he was admitted to the bar, but

3

because he was pro se?

4

MR. DYK:

Well, he could have — he could have

5

proceeded either to seek admission pro hac vice or to

6

proceed under this rule.

7

do the pro hac vice because the rule allowed it anyway.

8

10

QUESTION:

It wasn't necessary for him to

So at any rate he was not admitted to

practice as an attorney, either for this case or
generally, in the Federal court in Kentucky?

11

MR. DYK:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct, he was not.
Now, Mr. Dyk, you don't take the

13

position that all pro se litigants are eligible for

14

attorneys' fees, just those who are attorneys?

15

MR. DYK:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

16

take the position that while some of the purposes of the

17

statute would be served by allowing attorneys' fees to pro

18

se litigants who are not attorneys, that the language of

19

the statute in referring to an attorney assumes a licensed

20

member of the bar --

21

QUESTION:

Well, the statute also refers to

22

prevailing parties, which might more easily be read to

23

cover all than just attorneys.

that you limited your argument.

I thought it was curious

would be fulfilled by allowing attorneys' fees to non­

5

legislative history wishing to involve attorneys in these

6

cases.

7

QUESTION:

But there is the reference in

Well, if you — if you look to the

8

language the phrase "attorneys' fee," isn't the more

9

natural meaning of that to presuppose that there is an

10

attorney-client relationship?
MR. DYK:

11

I think not, Justice O'Connor.

I

12

think the reference is to the fee that the court allows to

13

the attorney in the case, and of course this statute comes

14

to the Court today with the gloss placed on it by both the

15

Blum and the Blanchard cases, which have specifically held

16

that this statute does not contemplate cost-based

17

recovery.

18

under this statute whether there is a paying relationship

19

between attorney and client.

In other words, it does not make any difference

20

Indeed, if one looks at the legislative history,

21

it seems that one of the clear purposes of the statute was

22

to award fees to individuals who were not charging their

23

clients for their services.

24

the statute to the word fee, it is now clear under this

25

Court's earlier decision that the payment of -- an actual

i\

1

payment of the fee is not what the statute means.

2

QUESTION:

True, but it may still contemplate an

3

attorney-client relationship.

4

MR. DYK:

I think — I think not, Justice

5

O'Connor, because not only does the statutory language not

6

draft it in a way that requires representation, and I

7

think it would have been relatively easy for Congress to

8

do that if it intended to do it, but the policies of the

9

statute are fully served in the case of an individual

10

attorney who is proceeding pro se.

11

statute is designed —

13

QUESTION:

First of all, the

What about that old saw that he who

represents himself has a fool for a client?

14

MR. DYK:

15

QUESTION:

Well, I realize —
Maybe Congress had in mind that

16

people should get attorneys in order to vindicate civil

17

rights causes of action.

18

MR. DYK:

I think there is no question but that

19

Congress wanted attorneys to be involved.

There is no

20

question that Congress to some extent, to a significant

21

extent, was motivated by the desire to provide attorneys

22

to people who could not afford them.

23

the statute in that way.

24

and it had the Fair Housing Act before it as an example at

25

the time that it passed this statute, it could have

But it did not draft

For example, it could have said,

2

assume the payment of the fees themselves."

that.

4

because it had broad purposes in enacting this statute.

5

It didn't do

It acted more broadly, and it acted more broadly

It was concerned that without private

6

enforcement of the civil rights laws, that the civil

7

rights laws might become a dead letter.

8

seeking to encourage civil rights litigation by awarding

9

these fees, not to discourage it.

It was actively

And again and again

10

this Court has said and the legislative history has said

11

that this was the central purpose, to encourage these

12

suits to be brought to vindicate the civil rights not only

13

of the plaintiffs in the cases, but of other people whom

14

the plaintiffs represented.

15

At the same time there was a lesser purpose to

16

some extent deter the defendants in these cases from

17

raising defenses to meritorious claims.

18

these purposes are fully served by cases in which an

19

attorney is proceeding pro se.

20

think, and conceded by the other side, by both the

21

respondent and by the United States, that pro se

22

organizations proceeding under the statute are entitled to

23

recover an attorney's fee.

24

of the statute which lead to that result should lead to

25

the result of a pro se individual being covered by the

2

statute as well.
And if this Court were to rule otherwise I think

3

there would be extremely difficult line-drawing problems.

4

I mean, you could have one case in which an individual

5

represented a corporation or a nonprofit corporation.

6

could have a case in which an individual was a member of a

7

voluntary association which was bringing the suit, or, as

8

in some of the cases, you could have an individual who was

9

representing a partnership, or in this case —

10

QUESTION:

You

In all of those cases the entity is

11

larger than the attorney who is appearing before the court

12

on its behalf.

13

MR. DYK:

I think there are, there are in the

14

examples that I have given so far, that is true, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, but Mr. Kay could also have sued in the name of

16

the Kay for President Committee, which may consist of one

17

or two people.

18

The fact is that there may be — by introducing

19

a distinction between organizations and individuals, I

20

think we're suggesting that some very difficult line­

21

drawing problems could be introduced, line-drawing which

22

isn't justified by the purposes of the statute and that we

23

would end up, as this Court said in Hensley should not be

24

the case, we could end up with other litigations to try to

25

determine whether it's an organizational situation or an

individual situation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, what is your answer to the

3

situation where house counsel represents a nonprofit

4

organization?

5

MR. DYK:

That does happen with some frequency.

6

It was something that they were apparently aware of in

7

passing the statute.

8

hearings, and there is a specific reference to it in the

9

House report, and, that clearly says that under those

There are references to it in the

10

circumstances that the organization is entitled to recover

11

the attorney's fee.

12

Citizen has pointed out how often that occurs and how

13

important it is.

14

And the amicus brief of Public

And I understand that point to be conceded by

15

the other side, that if it's a nonprofit corporation, if

16

it has a corporate form, that it is within the statute and

17

that an attorney's fee can be recovered, even though it is

18

another pro se situation.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose organizations,

corporations and other organizations have to be

represented by counsel.

qualify for this organizational status, they don't have to

4

5

being represented by an attorney who is a member of the

6

organization, it seems difficult — very difficult to

7

distinguish between that situation and the corporate

8

situation, and very difficult to believe that Congress

9

could have intended to do that.
QUESTION:

10

I'm not sure.

They can proceed by a member of

And if it so happens that they proceed

Is that, is that for certain, Mr.

11

Dyk?

Do you know of any cases where a

12

partnership appears pro se?

13

MR. DYK:

Yes.

There is one of the leading

14

District of Columbia cases, the D.C.Circuit cases here,

15

the Cuneo case, involved a case in which the partnership

16

appeared pro se and Mr. Cuneo represented them, and the

17

D.C. Circuit held that he was entitled to fees.

18

things do happen.

19

So these

And if, if the Court tries to draw a line

20

between individuals and organizations I fear it will be a

21

very difficult line for the courts to administer in

22

practice, not only because these situations do exist, but

23

it would create an incentive for people to create an

24

organization for the purpose of getting the attorneys'

25

fees .

1

Now the Solicitor General tells us don't worry,

2

we'll pierce the corporate veil, we'll go behind that, but

3

there again I think one is just getting into all sorts of

4

difficult litigation over the question of attorneys' fees.

5

We are told -- we are told by the other side

6

that there are purposes of the statute which would be

7

defeated if attorneys' fees were allowed here.

8

said, for example, by the brief of the State of Hawaii and

9

others as amicus that if attorneys' fees are allowed here

10

it will devastate the State treasuries, and that for that

11

reason the Court should not construe 1988 as allowing

12

attorneys' fees in this situation.

13

It is

The difficulty with that argument, of course, is

14

it will devastate the State treasuries only, only if the

15

petitioner as the plaintiffs in these cases prevail.

16

if they prevail they are serving the very purpose of the

17

Civil Rights Act that led Congress to award of an

18

attorney's fee.

19

And

They also argue that the reason that Congress

20

wanted to get attorneys involved in these civil rights

21

cases was to perform a sifting function, that they would

22

sit there and decide which cases were meritorious and

23

ought to be brought, and which cases were not meritorious

24

and should not be brought.

25

a pro se attorney isn't going to perform the same sifting

And they somehow suggest that

1

function.
The difficulty here again is that there simply

2

3

isn't a single statement in the legislative history

4

suggesting that Congress enacted 1988 or brought attorneys

5

into the process in order to perform this sifting

6

function.
QUESTION:

7

Well, the whole idea of our

8

profession is that that degree of insulation,

9

independence, and professionalism prevails because there

10

is a distance between you and the client.

And you would

11

concede on the one hand that a pro se who is not an

12

attorney cannot get the fees, and yet you would create for

13

the legal profession this little option where they could

14

represent themselves.

15

detracts from the purpose of the Congress in asking for

16

professional representation.

17

MR. DYK:

And it seems to me that it somewhat

The problem, Justice Kennedy, that the

18

Congress faced in 1976 after this Court's decision in

19

Alyeska was that they thought these cases would not be

20

brought because they could not be brought based on the

21

traditional attorney-client relationship in which the

22

client retained the attorney and agreed to pay the

23

attorney.

24

that they concluded that if they did not provide for an

25

award of attorneys' fees, that the civil rights laws would

Congress felt, in fact, so strongly about this

QUESTION:

This

The briefs that

Well, I suppose you could say the

same about some pro se's who are not attorneys.
MR. DYK:

I agree with you, Justice Kennedy,

that is quite true that there are purposes of this statute

10

which would be served by awarding fees to individuals who

11

are not attorneys.

12

legislative matter I would completely agree that there was

13

a great deal to be said for that.

14

And if I were to approach this as a

But there is the word "attorney" in the statute,

15

there is the reference in the legislative history to the

16

desire to bring expert individuals into this, and for that

17

reason we think that the language and the history of the

18

statute suggests that it falls short of awarding it to

19

non-attorney pro se's, a result which has been reached by

20

many of the circuits which have nonetheless agreed that

21

pro se attorneys should recover.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, I don't understand how you

23

make that distinction.

As Justice O'Connor points out,

24

the person who gets the award is simply described in the

25

statute as the prevailing party, which would include

anybody, attorneys or not.

The award is described as

attorney's fees, a reasonable attorney's fee, but you're
ignoring the word fee.

There isn't any fee, nobody has

paid any money to anybody, so why not ignore the word
attorney's too?

I mean, it's just a description of what

the money is for, not a description of what, what the
function actually is.
MR. DYK:

I think I'm not, Justice Scalia,

ignoring the word fee.

I think that based on this Court's

decisions in Blum and Blanchard that I read the word fee
as referring to the payment that is made to the prevailing
party.

And I approach the statute with the understanding

from this Court's decisions that it is — does not provide
for cost-based recovery.

But I also approach the statute

not only looking at the word attorney, but looking at the
legislative history which suggests this desire to have
attorneys involved.

There was an apparent conclusion that

attorneys were invaluable contributions to these cases.
Now, a number of members of the Court have
suggested that non-attorneys may bring valuable
contributions.

I don't dispute that.

I say again that I

agree that non-attorneys may make very valuable
contributions to these cases, and that there are many
reasons for arguing that they should also be covered.

And

I agree that if you look at the words "prevailing party"

reach the conclusion under this statute that it covers

non-attorneys.

5

That issue of course is not before the

But we, I -- I'm giving you my best

understanding of what I think Congress intended, and I

think that Congress probably did not intend to include pro

se non-attorneys within the statute, even though there are

strong reasons for doing it.

21

language of 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 indicates that pro se

MR. LONG:

Yes, that's exactly right, Mr. Chief

Justice.
We think the language of Section 1988 which

6

provides that a prevailing party other than the United

7

States may recover a reasonable attorney's fee as part of

8

the costs answers the question presented in this case.

9

The word "attorney" ordinarily denotes a person who is

10

both licensed to practice law and who acts as the

11

representative or agent of a client.

12

generally do represent clients, but that does not mean

13

that a lawyer who litigates a case pro se is functioning

as an attorney.

15

the agent or representative of another.

16

representation is the essence of phrases such as attorney

17

in fact and power of attorney.

language in Section 1988 reinforces the conclusion that

Congress used attorney in its usual sense.

client relationship or who the attorney represents in a

corporate setting.

can answer quite easily in the borderline or difficult

9

cases that may arise.

It is the kind of determination

It is the kind of question that courts

10

But in addition to a requirement of an attorney,

11

there is a requirement of an attorney's fee as part of the

12

costs, and a pro se litigant cannot pay himself a fee.

13

pro se lawyer also incurs no costs for legal services

14

other than opportunity costs, and this Court has never

15

held that opportunity costs are compensable as attorneys'

16

fees .

A

Now, it is correct, as petitioner observes, that

18

organizations represented by in-house counsel, as well as

19

clients represented by attorneys on a pro bono basis, are

20

eligible for fee awards under Section 1988.

21

not foreclose reliance on the statutory language

22

authorizing an award of fees as a part of costs for two

23

reasons.

24
25

But this does

First, organizations actually incur costs for
representation by in-house attorneys, although the costs

may be in the form of a flat fee, that is a salary, and

2

lawyers who represent clients pro bono have a fee

3

arrangement with the client, even if it is to waive the

4

fee, and more typically the arrangement is in the nature

5

of a contingent fee, that is to recover any fee award

6

under Section 1988.

7

Second, the cases awarding attorneys' fees to

8

in-house counsel rest on -- I'm sorry, the second reason

9

is that the awards of fees to organizations rest on the

10

legislative history rather than the language of the

11

statute, and we think the legislative history simply

12

doesn't apply to pro se lawyers, because, as we have

13

already argued, pro se lawyers are easily distinguished

14

from organizations.

15

We think the language of Section 1988 answers

16

the question presented in this case, but the legislative

17

history reinforces our interpretation of the language.

18

Statements in the legislative history such as "many

19

citizens have little or no money with which to hire a

20

lawyer" indicate that Congress had in mind encouraging

21

plaintiffs to obtain legal representation rather than

22

litigating cases on their own, and we think that applies

23

to lawyer litigants as well as to all other litigants.

24
25

And finally, awarding attorneys' fees to pro se
lawyers would not further the purpose of Section 1988,

1

which is to make sure that competent counsel are available

2

to civil rights plaintiffs.

3

not necessary to adopt the result petitioner argues for to

4

achieve the purpose of Section 1988, because under the

5

court of appeals decision lawyers have precisely the same

6

ability to vindicate their civil rights as all other

7

litigants, and in fact they may have a greater ability

8

because if they choose to litigate pro se they can apply

9

whatever additional skills they have.

10

At a minimum, it's certainly

And we also think, frankly, that encouraging pro

11

se litigation by lawyers would not ensure that competent

12

counsel would be available in civil rights cases.

13

lawyers often lack the detachment and objectivity that is

14

necessary for effective professional representation.

15

pro se lawyer may be inclined to focus on the recovery of

16

a fee to the exclusion of vindication of the merits.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DYK:

As I listen to the United States and

other than an individual can litigate on a pro se basis

and recover under the statute.

concession, I think, that a partnership could do that.

22

bring a class action and recover.

I hear concessions that a

having to attack one of them for the second time, and

Wouldn't the statutory purpose been

retained an attorney to represent him, and then there

14

would be no question that attorney could get an attorney's

fee?

16

MR. DYK:

Mr. Chief Justice, that is surely true

17

that the statutory purpose would be served if he had

18

gotten an attorney to represent him.

19

and I think it's reflected in the history of this statute

20

that I am talking about, is that he may not have been able

to get an attorney to represent him, and as a result of

I think it is not possible to assume that every

14

I think in many cases it is not an option that is

QUESTION:

So Congress intended pro se attorney

17

potentially to be more favorably situated with respect to

18

getting attorneys' fees than the typical nonlawyer civil

19

rights plaintiff?

20

MR. DYK:

As I said earlier, I think there are,

21

that the nonlawyer civil rights plaintiff who proceeds pro

22

se can make a significant claim that he is serving the

23

purposes of the statute.

out, if you focus on the terminology "prevailing party"

25

rather than on the word "attorney," maybe one concludes

that the non-attorney pro se should also recover.

fact is that the pro se attorney is directly serving every

significant purpose that this statute was designed for.

He is bringing a meritorious civil rights case.

How many?

I do not know the answer,

And by seeking out these statutes, by

successfully having them declared unconstitutional, by

20

litigating these issues he is doing exactly what Congress

21

wanted done, and that is that the civil rights of people

in this country are vindicated.
