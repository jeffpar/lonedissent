ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The issue in this case is whether a defendant may

11

challenge the assignment of jury selection in a criminal

12

case to a magistrate when the defendant has not objected to

13

that procedure in the district court.

What if the error was that the dispute

It was the jury was selected by somebody who didn't meet
article III requirements.

Could that rise to the level of

MR. BRYSON:

I think in some cases it could, Your

Honor, and let me suggest that I think there is a difference
because that depends entirely on who that person was.

QUESTION:

Is that true even where Gomez makes

clear that Congress has not authorized magistrates to carry

out this function?
MR. BRYSON:

10

Oh, I think so, Your Honor.

that — it is accepted,

necessarily mean that that right,

-- I would pick for example discrimination in the selection

of a grand jury — in which the Court has held that these

errors may not be deemed harmless, yet the Court has further

said that if not objected to in a timely basis they may be

Indeed there are some instances

QUESTION:

19

MR.

BRYSON:

Your Honor, I think -Is there any end to it?
I think a magistrate could pick a

grand jury in the sense that typically I think a grand jury

21

is selected by the clerk of the court.

23

Now, respondent claims that although those cases

can be distinguished, that case and the — Murray against

Carrier case which followed it, can be distinguished on the

7

grounds that those are habeas corpus cases.

8

think that that distinction holds water, because the whole

9

cause and prejudice doctrine originated in a Federal case,

10

and originated as an application of a Federal waiver rule,

11

rule 12.

But we don't

12

It is clear that the rule with respect to cause

13

is at least as strict in the Federal system as it is under

14

the language with respect to futility that I have just read.

15

Indeed, rule 12 does contain, after all, an exception for

16

cause, while rule 51 and rule 52 do not.

17

there is less room for the futility doctrine in this setting

18

than in the setting of habeas corpus cases where the Court

19

has applied the — the cause and prejudice.

So, if anything,

20

QUESTION:

3

MR.

Plain and harmless error?

BRYSON:

Well,

the

difference

is

that

4

something in order to be — there may be errors that -- as

5

to what you cannot say that they are harmless, because you

6

simply cannot say with the confidence that is required for

7

the harmless error doctrine —
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Did I read your brief right?

Did you

say that if it's plain error, the same error would be plain
in every case where it happened?
MR. BRYSON:

11

Is that it?

Well, I think typically you have to

12

look at each case to decide whether a particular error is

13

plain.

14

with respect to all cases, but in looking at plain error you

15

are deciding whether there was a miscarriage of justice in

16

a particular case.

17

has distinguished between cases in which there is -- it is

18

impossible to determine whether an error is harmless.

Now, there may be some errors that would be plain

And that's the reason I think this Court

19

But if the case, if the error is not called to the

20

attention of the court and the later claim is made that the

21

error is plain, then you look at the question of particular

22

prejudice.

23

against the United States itself, and again, if I may quote,

24

the Court explained in the context where it was talking

25

about an error that could not be deemed to be harmless --

The — that — that point was made in Davis

this was discrimination in the grand jury context — that

MR. BRYSON:

Mr. Bryson,
