ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

89-1671, The City of Columbia

MR. KLEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Petitioners, The City of Columbia, South

14

Carolina and COA, a private billboard company were found

15

to have violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to

16

restrain competition through the passage of two zoning

17

ordinances.

18

presented is whether such ordinances, even though they

19

satisfy this Court's test in Town of Hallie, can

20

nevertheless violate the antitrust laws if their enactment

21

was motivated by the city's desire to benefit a private

22

business rather than the public at large.

23

they cannot for two related reasons.

24

regulation that meets the Hallie test is deemed to be the

25

sovereign action of the State and under Parker such action

The principal question

We submit that

First, municipal

•is exempt from the antitrust laws regardless of

2

legislative motive and, second, under the Noerr-Pennington

3

Doctrine, the Sherman Act likewise doesn't apply to a

4

private party's successful effort to seek such an

5

ordinance.
If I may then begin with the judgment against

6
7

the city.

The scope of the Parker doctrine was set

8

out — the scqpe of the State action exemption, excuse me,

9

was set out in Parker where the court made plain that the

10

Sherman Act doesn't cover a market restraint imposed by

11

the State as sovereign.

12

generic exception based on the source of the restraint.

13

This Court has repeatedly made that very point, including

14

recently in Hoover v. Ronwin, where it stated that quote

15

"when a State legislature adopts- legislation, its actions

16

ipso facto are exempt from the antitrust laws."

17

I want to emphasize that that's a

Indeed in Ronwin itself, the court squarely

18

rejected an exception to Parker based on the kind of claim

19

at issue here.

20

association and a State supreme court had conspired to

21

take action motivated by a desire to protect the economic

22

interests of lawyers.

23

In that instance that a private bar

Now if we agree that had South Carolina passed

24

this statute, if would be exempt.

25

is whether the city is entitled to a lesser measure of

Parker protection.

question —
QUESTION:

3

We think the answer to that

What do you think would have happened

4

if the court of appeals would have held if the State had

5

passed this statute?

6

MR. KLEIN:

7

My, my understanding from the

rationale is that they would have reached the same result.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KLEIN:
QUESTION:

10

Exactly.
That is my view.
Well, then if you say we all agree,

11

we've already decided the case.

12

MR. KLEIN:

13

QUESTION:

Well, I, I think that is the answer.
So you shouldn't say that.

You're —

14
15

MR. KLEIN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, though

16

that there are two questions.

17

18

been made that it isn't.

First, is this the same as

And I think there is at least some suggestion

MR. KLEINr

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KLEIN:

But I do think if it is —

But the court of appeals would have

That, that is my view.
All right.

All right, then.

And I think the answer is as you

24

suggest, Justice White, that that's what Town of Hallie

25

compels.

Hallie says in a court of appeals felt -- ruled

i

1

that it was met here -- Hallie says that once a municipal

2

ordinance passes its test, it is in fact the sovereign

3

action of the State.

4

Once that's so, as Justice White has just suggested, that

5

cities get the same measure of Parker protection as do the

6

States and for each that measure of protection doesn't

7

turn on the hows or the whys behind the particular

8

ordinance.

9

That's what the analysis calls for.

Now the court of appeals — correctly as you

10

point out, Justice White — took the contrary view and it

11

fashioned a rule, that is, it found an exception to Parker

12

based on the notion that Congress wanted to strike down

13

governmental action when taken for the wrong motives.

14

simply don't think that's a plausible view for several

15

reasons.

We

16

First of all, by making antitrust liability turn

17

on the political process, the Fourth Circuit has read into

18

the Sherman Act an intent to regulate politics.

19

Court has already made clear Congress had no such intent.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Well, what if the city council had

been bribed?
MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, our view is that if the

23

city council had been bribed that would not be an

24

antitrust violation.

25

But this

QUESTION:

And that is —
So you would say that Parker still

9

Sure.

And we think that for several

I think you have to say that, I take

it.

All right.

First, again —

8

Absolutely.

Under my first theory I have to say

My second theory, Justice White, which, which I don't

10

think the Court need reach, is that this case doesn't

11

involve bribery at all.

12

position is as you suggest.

13

But in any case I, my first

And I say that for several reasons.

One,

14

bribery is a political issue.

15

and the Court has already said the Sherman Act doesn't

16

regulate politics.

17

exception you're going to totally undermine the rationale

18

of Parker itself.

19

explained that in the absence of a clear indication from

20

Congress, it was not prepared, it would be inappropriate

21

to conclude that the antitrust laws meant to restrict a

22

State's sovereign prerogatives.

23

an inquiry based on governmental motive would do.

24
25

It's a political question

Second, once you open up this kind of

In that case, of course, the Court

Yet that's precisely what

Let's take, for example, the kind of zoning
ordinance at issue in this case.

That ordinance obviously

serves, such ordinances routinely serve a public purpose.

2

Yet, they necessarily restrain trade, because by

3

definition they restrict supply.

4

circumstances it's no surprise that a private party —

5

QUESTION:

Given that set of

But Mr. Klein, do you think that the

6

zoning power would give the city the authority to grant an

7

exclusive franchise in the billboard advertising field to

8

a particular qompany?

9

MR. KLEIN:

I, I think it might, Your Honor.

10

It's a question that is I think the city would have that

11

power under South Carolina law.

12

would be whether it acts —

13

QUESTION:

Now then the question

You think it has the power to

14

grant — say it was given an exclusive franchise in all

15

the restaurants in town so that presumably it could zone

16

restaurants.

17

to one chain of restaurants, say no other chains can come

18

into the town.

It could have given an exclusive franchise

power -- could it be properly used within Hallie to grant

3

exclusive franchises to various kinds of businesses?

4

MR. KLEIN:

Would the zoning

I think it could.

zoning interests — in other words the basic interests in

restricting undue clutter and so forth —

MR. KLEIN:

The city would take that approach

consistent with the antitrust laws.

Mr. Klein, what you said about

bribery suggested to me a question similar to Justice

Stevens'.

I think —

19

QUESTION:

It's invalid.

20
21

It's not State action.

Would that be a violation of the antitrust laws then?
MR. KLEIN:

I think it wouldn't be because

22

frankly — if I can fight the premise, Justice Scalia — I

23

don't think that it wouldn't be State action.

24

I refer you to the Bates case, this Court found that that

25

action there was protected by Parker even though it

don't think it turns on that kind of inquiry.

So I

Well, it doesn't, it doesn't

determine what State action for those constitutional

8

purposes, but .it might well determine what States — what

9

is State action for purposes of Parker.

10

MR. KLEIN:

But, but I, I don't think that's

11

consistent with Bates and frankly that is, I think, that's

12

flatly what the Court held in Bates.

13

it would be an impossible rule.

14

Justice Scalia, is that whenever you have an antitrust

15

case, the first issue would be this kind of case.

16

State — did the city violate State law or did the State

17

violate State law?

18

19

default, so antitrust courts would be in the business of

20

essentially having a State case first as a prerequisite to

21

jurisdiction and I don't think that makes any sense.

22

But frankly I think

What it would mean,

Did the

Sometimes that's going to turn on a

Sometimes it's going to be a procedural

Now the other thing I want to suggest aside from

23

the fact that once you allow — once you acknowledge that

24

zoning laws are going to lead to people who benefit from

them lobbying aggressively, making campaign contributions,

1

then if you allow that to lead to an antitrust case,

2

you're going to undo Parker all together.

3

time, just as in this case, one person wins, one person

4

loses, then the threat or the actuality of an antitrust

5

action is there and that I understood was what Parker

tried to prevent.

Because every

QUESTION:

17

Although the respondent does raise in

18

a, a footnote, I believe, the argument again, that Town of

Hallie doesn't even apply.

MR. KLEIN:

Justice Stevens expressed that perhaps a zoning ordinance

2

authority does not enable towns to purposely exclude

3

everybody but one from a particular business.

4

MR. KLEIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think the

5

issue is here, but I think if the issue was here the

answer is clear and let me, let me make, make that -- what

I mean by that paren.

It may not, but I think this one was

clear and I also would suggest that every zoning

First of all, if the ordinances are valid under

Because what this case

2

does, if you do anything but affirm it seems to me is you

3

put the stamp of approval on a factual scenario that

4

eliminates, that eliminates the process and closes it and

5

turns it over to private individuals.
Now that's what we have seen in the cases that

we've tried not to do.

8

and if we lose on a playing field, we lose, but we've got

9

to get onto it.

We try to keep the process open

And when you close that playing field,

10

when you say that you can trade your power, trade your

11

billboards, trade that to keep your monopoly and to keep

12

them in power, then there is no process.

It's not unlike

15

In closing, I'd like to make a couple of points.

16

And one of them everybody seems — well, Mr. Klein doesn't

17

but when you read the writings and the cases — everybody

18

seems to say that bribery should not be allowed.

19

bad word.

20

and — subject the bribery people to antitrust liability.

Okay, did you ever -- if you go behind bribery, look and

see what it is.

It's the fact that he has eliminated and sold

2

his office.

He has in effect — what we have here —■ he

3

has closed the process.

4

break it down, it's nothing more than paying money to

5

close the process and I don't think anybody — at least

6

from the writings that I've seen — wants to say that the

7

antitrust, Noerr-Pennington, or the Parker should be okay

8

even in the fgce of bribery.

So what bribery is and when you

And if we look at that, if we look at the

Affiliated Capital case from the Fifth Circuit where it

11

was en banc with a lot of judges, you see a thorough

discussion of this, these principles.

14

they're asking you to draw these lines.

15

You see one in the

And I'd point to one last point.

And that is" if

16

you look at the charges requested by the COA as to what

17

you, the jury must find, to make us liable, this is what

18

it says.

19

this protection of the citizen fails, however, when one or

20

more of the public officials joins in an illegal agreement

22

action.

an affirmative, yes, they conspired.
And you say under what criteria could they find

2

3

a conspiracy?

It's very important, I think, for the Court

4

to look at Judge Perry's instruction on conspiracy,

5

because we had to overcome the strictest of burdens and

6

this is on — found on page 76 of the Joint Appendix and

7

it says, that we the plaintiff must not just prove a

8

factual scenario that supports a conspiracy.

9

prove a factual scenario that doesn't allow or

We must

doesn't — can't be understood to also be innocent or

11

nonconspiratorial.
QUESTION:

12

Now that's a heavy burden.
Yes, Mr. Lewis, but the court of

13

appeals affirmed in the Noerr aspect of the case on the

14

sham theory rather than the coconspirator theory, didn't

15

it?

16

MR. LEWIS:

That's correct.

Now there is a

17

separation in the case law of that, but the unobjected to

18

charge on the sham exception is found at page 81 of the

19

Joint Appendix, and this is what it says and this was

20

unobjected to.

21

the defendants conspired together with the intent to

22

foreclose the plaintiff from meaningful access to a

23

legitimate decision making process with regard to the

24

ordinance in question, then your verdict would be for the

25

plaintiff on that issue.

No one took issue with it.

MR. KLEIN:

Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

I regret burdening the Court with issues of the

8

record, but I view bribery as a very serious charge.

9

I don't think it should be made without support.

10

And

First of all, the issue of how this case was

11

tried, I suggest the Court look at page 59 of the Joint

12

13

instructions have nothing to do with bribery.

Court can check the record — there was one contribution

price was $1,000 and they paid $600, they reported the
