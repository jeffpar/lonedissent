CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear first this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER UNITED STATES

12

GENERAL STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case brings before the Court an important

13

issue of the coverage of the Voting Rights Act.

The

14

specific question is whether the results test of section 2

15

of that act applies to the election of judges.

16

banc opinion in the LULAC case, which will be argued next,

17

the Fifth Circuit held that judges are not covered by the

18

results test.

19

of that statute, added in 1982, by its terms applies to

20

the election of representatives, and in the court's view,

21

the elected judges are not representatives.

22

of the opinion in LULAC, the Fifth Circuit panel in this

23

case, which involves a challenge to the at-large election

24

of two justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court, ordered

25

this lawsuit dismissed.

In its en

The court's reasoning was that section 2(b)

As a result

In our view the Fifth Circuit, with all respect,

1
2

is wrong.

3

Rights Act, including its comprehensive definition of vote

4

and voting set forth in section 14(c)(1), in light of the

5

structure of the statute, including section 5, the

6

preclearance provision, which all admit covers the

7

election of judges, and in light of the elaborate history

8

of the Voting Rights Act at the time of its original

9

passage and the 1982 amendments.

It is wrong in light of the text of the Voting

The Fifth Circuit also, we believe, erred on

10
11

what it viewed as a basic point.

12

judges covered by the terms of the statute, when they are

13

elected they are candidates for public office, and that is

14

what the Voting Rights Act covers.

15

as to the meaning of the term "representatives."

16

that for two reasons.

17

no definition of the term "representatives."

18

indication that Congress was using this as a term of art.

19

And judges who are elected are quite literally

20

representatives within the dictionary meaning of that

21

term.

22

That is not only are

But it is also wrong
We think

The first is that Congress provided
There is no

And, as Judge Higginbotham pointed out in his

23

concurring opinion in LULAC, judges who have been chosen

24

by the people and are directly accountable to the people

25

are in a very real and practical sense representatives.

about.

7

whatever, the very important, the lofty function, the

8

solemn responsibility of that justice, once the justice is

9

in office, the plain fact remains that to get into office

10
11

And that's what the Voting Rights Act is all
It's about voting, and it's about elections.

And

in Louisiana the justice had to get himself elected.
QUESTION:

General Starr, there is some

12

authority for the proposition that there is no one-vote

13

one-person requirement in election for judges.

14

think a vote dilution claim is made out in the absence of

15

that, if applied to judges?

16

GENERAL STARR:

How do you

The line of authority, and it is

17

clear that judges are not covered by the one-person one-

18

vote principle, is inapplicable here.

19

Court can see that both in terms of the function of that

20

body of law and what that body of law was designed to get

21

at, and it can see it most clearly in this Court's

22

decision in White against Regester.

23

analyzing the Texas districting scheme, the Court rejected

24

a one-person one-vote challenge, but at the same time

25

credited and upheld an attack to the minority dilution

And I think the

1

effect in the two counties -- in Dallas County and Bayer

2

County.

3

seeking to get at different themes.

4

The two are entirely distinct lines of authority

QUESTION:

But if the judges are representatives

5

in the way that you have described, then ought we to

6

rethink that line of authority and indicate that one-

7

person one-vote does apply to all representatives?

8

seems to me that, to the extent you say judges are

9

representatives, that it may undercut the rationale of the

It

10

line of authority which suggests that one-person one-vote

11

is inapplicable.
GENERAL STARR:

12

I respectfully disagree, and we

13

certainly are not urging that.

And I disagree for this

14

reason.

15

predominantly rural counties.

16

law is sound in this respect, that a State as a matter of

17

policy can make a determination that each county should

18

have a judge, even if the numbers don't justify that.

Think of a large State with perhaps quite small
The law is, and I think the

So too, it may very well be that even though the

19
20

numbers may not justify in terms of population the large

21

number of judges in an urban district as opposed to a

22

suburban district that perhaps is less litigious,

23

nonetheless States can determine to order their on

24

structures in ways that are responsive to the needs of the

25

people.

That strikes us as very sensible, and this Court

1
2

itself in White against Regester said those same kinds of

3

State interests and State policies permit greater

4

deviations in State legislative redistricting than is the

5

case in congressional districting, which requires almost

6

mathematical exactitude.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, what is the test then in a vote

dilution claim if it applies to judges?
GENERAL STARR:

9

The test in a vote dilution

10

claim is whether there is in fact, under the totality of

11

the circumstances as set forth in section 2(b), less of an

12

opportunity for minority persons to participate fully in

13

the political process and to elect candidates of their

14

choice.

15

It is what Congress did in -QUESTION:

Less than what, General Starr?

You

16

said there can be less than other peoples have -- than

17

other people have.

18

have much greater opportunity to elect a judge than people

19

in another county.

20

need a standard for dilution.

beer is unless you know what beer is, right?

You say that people in one county can

Less than what?

GENERAL STARR:

QUESTION:

It seems to me you

You don't know what watered

Less —

You need a standard of watering.

What is the standard for watering the election of judges?
GENERAL STARR:

The standard is less than

others, less than nonminority persons.

2

3

QUESTION:

But you have said it's okay to have

less of a chance than others in other counties, right?

4

GENERAL STARR:

No, in terms of equal protection

5

principles as embodied in one-person one-vote.

6

I am trying to make, Justice Scalia, is the line of

7

authority with respect to vote dilution is exactly

8

different, it is distinct.

9

passed by Congress.

10

The point

We are talking about a statute

We are not talking about a

constitutional standard under the Equal Protection Clause.
QUESTION:

11

Could you give me, you know, just

12

what the baseline is?

In those elections that are

13

governed by one-person one-vote we know what the baseline

14

is.

15

GENERAL STARR:

16

QUESTION:

Right.

People are supposed to have, no

17

matter what their race, the same say.

18

not the standard here.

19

then, when a person of a certain race has gotten less than

20

what he is entitled to?
GENERAL STARR:

21

Now you say that is

What is the -- how do I know,

I would commend to the Court the

22

vast body of law that the Senate report in 1982 looked to.

23

It said we have seen the test fashioned by this Court in

24

White v. Regester faithfully applied in no fewer than 23

25

cases.

And those cases all involve a totality of the

1

circumstances analysis which, as this Court put it in

2

White v. Regester, is an intensely local appraisal to

3

determine whether minorities enjoy full access.
QUESTION:

4
5

Did they also involve candidates who

were subject to the one-person one-vote requirement?
GENERAL STARR:

6

Some did, and some rejected one-

7

person one-vote challenges while at the same time

8

vindicating a vote dilution challenge brought by

9

minorities.
QUESTION:

10
11

Did they involve offices that were

not subject to the one-person one-vote requirement?
GENERAL STARR:

12

I don't think any of those did,

13

but some may.

14

none did.

15

them were intensely local.

16

recollection is one-person one-vote did apply.

18

I am not going to say authoritatively that

A vast array of offices were involved; some of

all those cases.

QUESTION:

22

Well, don't make me go back and read

Just tell me the test.

21

I do believe, my best

What is the standard?

You know, what

is the baseline?
GENERAL STARR:

The baseline is set forth in the

23

statute, and that baseline is the totality of the

24

circumstances.

25

QUESTION:

What does that mean?

I don't

understand.

That means it depends, right?

2

GENERAL STARR:

3

QUESTION:

4

GENERAL STARR:

Correct.

I do not think that's a baseline.
That's the congressionally

5

mandated baseline.

6

dilution of the effectiveness and the ability of

7

minorities to participate fully in the electoral process

8

and to elect candidates of their choice.

9

what this Court said in White against Regester.
QUESTION:

10
11

It is whether there is in fact a

Well, wasn't, White against Regester

was based on the Equal Protection Clause, wasn't it?

12

GENERAL STARR:

13

QUESTION:

14

GENERAL STARR:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So it was a constitutional law case.
That is correct.

And what happened to White against

16

Regester in Bolden, do you think?

17

GENERAL STARR:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

That is exactly

What happened?

What happened to it in the Bolden

case?
GENERAL STARR:

In the Bolden case it eventually

21

went back, after this Court's decision in Bolden, and the

22

challenge was rejected.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But what happened to the White

against Regester, if anything?
GENERAL STARR:

Oh, they broke up the districts.

1

QUESTION:

2

GENERAL STARR:

3

they broke them up.

4

QUESTION:

Well —
They were at-large districts and

Do you think the vote dilution part

5

of White against Regester survived Bolden as a

6

constitutional matter?

7

GENERAL STARR:

8

perhaps it did not.

9

QUESTION:

11

Well --

GENERAL STARR:

10

Oh, as a constitutional matter,

But the point is Congress said

this is the standard in section 2 --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but what was the

13

Congress' authority to pass section 2, the amendment to

14

section 2?

15
16

GENERAL STARR:
Amendments.

17
18

The Fourteenth and Fifteenth

QUESTION:

You think it was the Fifteenth?

Could it be the Fourteenth, or what?

19

GENERAL STARR:

20

be both.

21

Fifteenth.

It could be — I think it could

I think it could be both Fourteenth and

QUESTION:

Even though Bolden said there was no

23

such equal protection requirement in the Fourteenth

24

Amendment?

Bolden said exactly that -12

QUESTION:

1

So, but Congress has the authority to

2

enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in a way that the Court

3

said wasn't required?
GENERAL STARR:

4

Correct.

Correct.

It can go

5

farther.

6

Senate report which this Court has described as

7

authoritative, believed that, with all respect, the Court

8

in City of Mobile erred.

9

respected that judgment because this Court is the final

10

authoritative voice on the meaning of the Constitution.

11

But what it did say is we have power to in fact embody

12

that test, which not only is correct and right in our

13

view, but also has shown to be workable.

14

does not in fact create an untriable, amorphous standard.
QUESTION:

15
16

19

But notwithstanding that, it

It works.

Does it incorporate, in your view,

GENERAL STARR:

Does what incorporate?

Section

2?

section that is here involved.

QUESTION:

1
2

Do you think it should be applied to

the election of judges?

3

GENERAL STARR:

I think that the standards set

4

forth in section 2, and as interpreted in, by this Court,

5

should be applied to the election of judges.

6

QUESTION:

But Gingles —

7

QUESTION:

No, I asked about Thornburg and

8

Gingles.

Should that rationale be applied across the

9

board in interpreting whether or not a judge, or

10

petitioner is contesting the allocation of judgeships have

11

made out a violation under section 2?

12

Thornburg and Gingles?

13

GENERAL STARR:

Do you use

Well, I think something very

14

important is involved in the election of judges, and this

15

is the State interest and its structure of the judiciary.

16

In this case there is no powerful State interest with

17

respect to at-large elections.

18

Louisiana Supreme Court is elected, with the exception of

19

the first judicial district, from single-member districts.

20

That is to say the

But the Senate report, and Thornburg against

21

Gingles noted this, did look to the Fifth Circuit's

22

seminal decision in Zimmer against McKeithen, and there,

23

particularly at page 1305 of that opinion, the Fifth

24

Circuit looked to the State interest and the powerful,

25

compelling nature of the State interest in that particular

structure.

We do believe that that is a consideration, a

2

factor to be weighed in the totality of the circumstances,

3

as we have sought to elaborate in our amicus brief in the

4

LULAC case.
QUESTION:

5

It just, it isn't clear to me how you

6

think Gingles would apply in the absence of a one-person

7

one-vote requirement.

8

majority holding in that case.

That was the underpinning of the

GENERAL STARR:

9

It may not apply in full

10

measure.

What I think Thornburg against Gingles was

11

seeking to do was to take the 1982 amendments as

12

elaborated by what the Gingles Court viewed as

13

authoritative, the Senate report, and to analyze that

14

report and then to say how is a case made out in the

15

legislative, that of course was a legislative contest or a

16

legislative districting issue and not a judicial

17

structuring issue.

18

that Judge Higginbotham set forth in his concurring

19

opinion in LULAC, that different kinds of considerations

20

are at play and should be considered.

21

no occasion to consider those.

QUESTION:

And we do think, for the very reasons

And Thornburg had

General Starr, do you think that the

I want to turn first to the question of

15

baselines that has been raised by Justices O'Connor,

16

Kennedy, and Scalia, and give you three ways in which that

17

baseline question can be answered in judicial elections

18

even assuming that one-person one-vote doesn't apply.

19

The first one is concrete from this case.

We

20

know already that the State of Louisiana is willing to

21

have single member districts ranging in size from 410,000

22

to over 800,000 justices.

23

with regard to the existing single-member districts.

24

Therefore, if plaintiffs can show that using the State's

25

own criteria for what sorts of populations should be in

That is part of the stipulation

1

districts, you can nonetheless draw a majority black

2

district.

3

We did that in this case.

That would satisfy the first prong of Gingles.

4

The second way of doing that --

5

QUESTION:

Excuse me, but that assumes that the

6

State is taking nothing into account except numbers, and

7

it presumably is also taking into account geography, the

8

nature of the political units into which these districts

9

are drawn.

10
11

12

13

You're imposing upon the State a numerical

criterion as the sole criterion.
MS. KARLAN:

No, that's not the sole criterion,

of course, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

It's the sole one you're willing to

14

judge them on.

15

the other justices, why can't they use it for this one.

You're saying they use 400 to 800,000 for

MS. KARLAN:

QUESTION:

18

Well, to begin with -And their answer might be well, we

have different geographic regions and there are different

20

MS. KARLAN:

Well, their answer might be, Your

21

Honor, that they don't think that representing black

22

people on the State supreme court is as important as

23

representing Cajuns, which is one of the reasons they have

24

the districts that they have now.

25

QUESTION:

That may well be, but you can make

1

that argument about any political arrangement that they

2

make.

That there may be a nefarious motive, but -MS. KARLAN:

3

Well, right.

And if there were a

4

nefarious motive for this statute it would clearly fall

5

under the Fourteenth Amendment regardless of one-person

6

one-vote's applicability.

7

black voters simply because they are not that numerous or

8

because one-person one-vote doesn't apply.

9

you ask how do we determine whether there is an

You can't discriminate against

Given that, if

10

alternative structure, and after all, that is what

11

Gingles' first factor asks, is there an alternative to the

12

existing one-person, the existing multi-member districting

13

scheme in which black citizens or Latinos would have the

14

potential to elect the candidate of their choice.

15

what the Court says on pages 49 through 50 of its opinion.

16

And I think also that that's the burden of the example at

17

the beginning of Justice O'Connor's concurrence in the

18

judgment.

19

That is

Given that, that is one way of measuring.
The second way of measuring is to say all right,

20

the State doesn't have to have equipopulous districting,

21

but let's use that as an illustrative tool.

22

in this case as well.

23

have 7 districts with absolutely equal populations in

24

them, it would still be possible to draw a majority black

25

district centered on Orleans Parish and contiguous parts

That was done

If the State of Louisiana were to

1

of Jefferson Parish, which are majority black.

2

proved at trial by the United States as plaintiff

3

intervenor.
QUESTION:

4

That was

But if we had that kind of a scheme

5

we would at least, or the court that has to, that had to

6

draw the district or find the violation would at least

7

have on the numerical issue a principled basis for saying

8

yes, there can be a district of appropriate size.

9

don't have some kind of one-person one-vote scheme, what

If we

10

is the principled basis upon which we can weight that

11

particular factor?
MS. KARLAN:

12

Well, to begin with in this case,

13

as I already alluded to, the districting size that the

14

State already has.

15

State of Louisiana --

That's a principled basis.

QUESTION:

16

If the

Well, what if the State is not quite

17

to cooperative, and what if the figures aren't quite that

18

neat?

19

20

100 to 1 judge?

21

Is 10 to 1 okay?

One district has a ratio of let's

Where do we draw those lines?

MS. KARLAN:

Well, Justice Souter, in this case

22

because it's a State supreme court, I would suggest that

23

if the State of Louisiana had one district with 3 million

24

people in it and another district with 12 people in it,

25

that would violate the Equal Protection Clause because it

would be arbitrary, regardless of whether one-person one-

vote applied.

3

against Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District.

4

that even when one-person one-vote principles don't apply,

5

the State still has to comport with the Equal Protection

6

Clause principles.

7

That's what this Court held in Salyer
It held

And I think that those principles allow you to

8

use as an illustrative example -- because that is all that

9

the first prong of Gingles asked, is is there an

10

alternative to the present system which would afford

11

minorities an equal opportunity to participate and to

12

elect the candidates of their choice.

13

that, that establishes that first prong of Gingles.

14

doesn't require the State to adopt that as the remedy at

15

all.

16

If you can show
It

Indeed, one thing that may be of interest to the

17

Court is that the districts upon which this Court rested

18

in Gingles in finding dilution were not the districts that

19

were ultimately adopted at the remedial phase.

20

the State had the right to come back with another set of

21

districts, and as long as those districts fully remedied

22

the violation, the State is free to do what it wants.

23

Because

The second -- the third point I wanted to make

24

about that is that in light of the decision by this Court

25

in Wells against Edwards, that's a summary affirmance.
21

(800) FOR DEPO

I

1

think that the dissent had the better of the argument

2

there, but you needn't go that far in order to find that

3

there was a mechanism for establishing dilution in this

4

case.

5

The second point I wanted to address is the role

6

of section 2(b), because I think that goes to Justice

7

O'Connor's question about whether referenda are covered.

8

Section 14(c)(1), the definitional provision of the act,

9

says that the word "vote" includes any election at which

10

propositions are voted on, as well as candidates.

11

section 2 of the act is the only nationwide prohibition on

12

discrimination, and my answer would be that section 2 in

13

part (a) defines what is prohibited, and part (b) is just

14

one illustration of how to go about proving that.

15

Now

And I'd like to give a concrete example of how

16

you might challenge a referenda.

Suppose, for example, in

17

a county that is majority black but in which blacks are

18

segregated in certain parts of the county, you have to get

19

a certain number of signatures to get an initiative on a

20

ballot from each precinct in the county, and there is

21

racial polarization and black people can't get any

22

signatures in a white area.

23

challenge that referenda provision for signatures and

24

petitions under the Results Clause because it dilutes the

25

strength there of a black majority.

You might be able to

So it's not just

22

1

election of representatives that is covered by the act.

2

Even if this Court were to hold that the word

3

representatives doesn't include judges, it would still

4

have to grapple with 2(a), which says no voting rights

5

standard practice or procedure, and that includes ones in

6

which no candidate is chosen at all.

7

Finally with regard to the question of merit

8

selection, yes, the Voting Rights Act would apply to merit

9

selections as well because, for example, if the State set

10

up its districts so that no matter what blacks did,

11

whether they voted to retain a judge or to throw him out,

12

they were always outvoted in that retention election by a

13

white block vote, then the structure of the districts

14

could be challenged itself.

15

Lastly I wanted to turn —

16

QUESTION:

So would you -- you would take the

17

position that in a State that for instance had five

18

supreme court justices, and they were all elected

19

Statewide, that a 2(b) claim could be made out and the

20

State could be forced to set up a separate district for

21

the election?

22

MS. KARLAN:

No, Justice O'Connor.

A section 2

23

claim could be made out.

The State would retain the

24

ability to come up with a number of other ways of electing

25

that five justice court.

They could continue to elect

2

What that would allow, any group that was greater than 15

percent of the population, because 1 over 6 is the

threshold of exclusion there --

Is it your position that judges are

MR. PUGH:

6

Yes, sir, that is my position.

And

I'll tell you the reason that's my position.

all, we must talk about, even though this Court in Gingles

And incidentally, despite the fact that this Court had

suggest to you that the authoritative, everybody agrees

what the Senate report said is authoritative, in one, two,

you could use the intent standard or you could use the

at least I believe, intent can still be used under section
