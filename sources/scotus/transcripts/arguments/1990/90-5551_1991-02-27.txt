ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENISE I. YOUNG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. YOUNG:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Edward Schad was convicted of first degree

11

12

murder and sentenced to death after a trial at which the

13

evidence presented was that the victim was strangled, and

14

that sometime later Mr. Schad had possession of some of

15

the victim's property.

16

applied in Mr. Schad's case allowed the prosecution to

17

obtain this verdict based on this then evidence.

Two rules Arizona mechanically

The question -- both issues presented in this

18
19

case presents is whether that verdict obtained by the

20

rigid application of these two rules is constitutionally

21

reliable.

22

23

QUESTION:

This was a verdict in the guilt

phase, Ms. Young?

24

MS. YOUNG:

25

Although I'm going to discuss each rule

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

separately, that is not how they worked at Mr. Schad's

2

capital trial.

3

verdict rule and Arizona's no lesser included offenses for

4

felony murder rule worked together, mutually reinforcing

5

one another and increasing the risk that the verdict

6

returned against Mr. Schad was erroneous.

7

These two rules, Arizona's one form of

I will first address the second issue we present

8

in our brief, Arizona's rule that there are no lesser

9

included offenses of felony murder, because it presents a

10

more narrow constitutional issue and it is controlled by

11

Beck v. Alabama.

12

The prosecutor's case for felony murder was

13

built circumstantially.

14

to the homicide of the victim.

15

connecting him to that crime was his possession of the

16

victim's property.

17

had possession of the property, the jury could find that

18

he robbed the victim and that he killed the victim during

19

the course of that robbery, and was therefore guilty of

20

felony murder.

21

No direct evidence tied Mr. Schad
The only evidence

The prosecutor argued that because he

The defense used that same evidence to argue

22

their defense that, because he had possession of the

23

property but because there was no evidence directly tieing

24

him to the homicide, that perhaps the jury could find him

25

a thief, perhaps a robber, but not a murderer.

Because of

1

Arizona's mandatory rule precluding lesser included

2

offenses for felony murder, the judge refused to instruct

3

the jury on the offense of robbery or on the offense of

4

theft, which under Arizona law is a lesser included

5

offense of robbery.

6

QUESTION:

7

lesser included offense instruction at all in this case?

8

10

Ms. Young, did the judge give any

MS. YOUNG:

The judge did give an instruction

for second degree murder which was a lesser included
offense instruction for premeditated murder.
QUESTION:

11

And do you think that requires, as a

12

matter of Federal constitutional law, any number of lesser

13

included offense instructions if — if the evidence makes

14

them out.

15

MS. YOUNG:

Yes.

Beck requires that the jury be

16

given all rational lesser included offenses where

17

supported by the evidence.

18

Now that is not as broad as it may seem.

Beck

19

of course is limited to capital cases.

20

define its offenses in such a manner that they are not a

21

lesser included offense of the greater offense.

22

that's not what Arizona did here.

not different than the rule in Beck v. Alabama.
QUESTION:

10

Well, is it — is it all that clear

11

that Beck should be read as requiring the giving of every

12

potential lesser included offense rather than just a less

13

drastic alternative than the death penalty which was given

14

here?

15

more than that.

I would think one could read Beck to require no

16

MS. YOUNG:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Your Honor, I just -And if not, why shouldn't we read it

that way?
MS. YOUNG:

Because, Your Honor, of the

20

principle that Beck was based on which was eliminating the

21

distortion in the fact-finding process and ensuring the

22

integrity and reliability of the verdict.

23

In the Beck situation, the fact-finding process

24

was distorted, because the jury was not able to consider a

25

lesser included noncapital, homicide offense.

3

MS. YOUNG:

4

QUESTION:

5

Wasn't that — wasn't the — Beck was

That's exactly right, Your Honor.
And so it was to give the jury an

option to imposing the death penalty.
MS. YOUNG:

6

Yes, Your Honor, but also giving

7

them an option to return a rational verdict.

8

based on rationalizing the fact-finding process, not

9

derationalizing the fact-finding process.
QUESTION:

10

Beck is

So you're saying if the jury in the

11

jury room agrees at the outset that first degree

12

premeditated murder has not been proven, at that point, if

13

they — they cannot consistently go to second degree

14

murder?

15

MS. YOUNG:

That's right, Your Honor.

Felony

16

murder as defined by Arizona law has two elements, a

17

killing occurring during the course of some statutorily

18

enumerated felony — here, robbery.

19

had a doubt as to whether Mr. Schad had anything to do

20

with the killing -- and that was the very factual issue in

21

dispute here, and there was considerable doubt here

22

whether he did -- were unable to return a verdict

23

consistent with that doubt, which is exactly what this

24

Court was concerned about in Beck, concerned about letting

25

the jury have a rational option if they are not convinced

Those jurors here who

that all of the elements of the greater offense have —
have been committed.
Because of the substantial risk where the jury
believes that one of the elements has not been established
beyond a reasonable doubt, but that they do believe the
defendant is clearly guilty of some wrong doing as
occurred here, there really was very little question that
Mr. Schad done something.

He did have possess of the

victim's property.
The Beck court — this Court recognized in Beck
that there was a substantial risk that such a jury would
convict -- would resolve its doubts in favor of conviction
rather than -- not -- excuse me -- not because it was
convinced of the defendant's guilt, but simply it did not
want to let the defendant go free.
This case presents a preclusion rule no
different than Beck.

And we ask this Court to reverse the

conviction of Mr. Schad on that basis because this jury
was not able to return that verdict.
And we must remember here that the prosecution
based its theory of felony murder on robbery, told the
jury this is the premise of the felony murder, and then
wiped out their option by — of returning a verdict
consistent with that premise because of Arizona's
mandatory rule.

MS. YOUNG:

But let's look at how Arizona

defines these crimes.
Arizona defines premeditated murder to have
three elements -- that the defendant killed, that he did

premeditation.

12

to make essential to the crime of premeditated murder.

MR. FORD:

The elements of the crime were — are

There are

charge may be presented to the jury, but as far as the

that the prosecutor told the jury, now there's two

presented that to the jury in the first place.

MR. FORD:

3

Yes, it is.

4

QUESTION:

May I just be sure we don't have a

dispute about one rather fundamental thing?

As I

understand it in the premeditated murder, there's the

element of the killing, the element of malice which can

8

proved by the use of the weapon, and thirdly, there's

premeditation.

And that in the other theory, all that's

10

necessary is to prove that there was robbery and a

killing.

12

that correct?

13

And there's no requirement of premeditation.

prove the offense at issue in this case by proving robbery

Yes.

MR. FORD:

The statute so reads that because

2

we're — what we're doing in all felony murder situations

3

-- you're transferring the specific intent from the felony

to satisfy the premeditation issue which all comes down —

5

that's why they're satisfied in that way.

QUESTION:

No.

QUESTION:

So your position is that if you have

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. YOUNG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

That's exactly our point on the Beck issue, that
this jury had no rational option if they did have a
rational doubt about one of the elements of felony murder.
And the supreme court, when it reviewed this issue, and it
set forth in the joint appendix, found that the evidence
would have supported a verdict for robbery.

But that this

jury was not given that option to return that verdict
because of the preclusion rule.
I also want to very quickly state that, contrary
to what Mr. Ford said, the prosecutor in this trial very
clearly argued the different factual routes, and we have
set out that portion of the argument in our joint appendix
at page 6 and 7.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Ms. Young.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
