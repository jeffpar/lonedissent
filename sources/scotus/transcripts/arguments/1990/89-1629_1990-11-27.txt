ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. SNOW

• ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SNOW:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
We are here this afternoon on Salve Regina

11

12

College's petition for certiorari to the First Circuit

13

Court of Appeals.

14

appeals erred when it failed to predict or attempt to

15

analyze how the Rhode Island supreme court would likely

16

rule on an unclear question of State law, in this case on

17

which jurisdiction was based solely upon diversity of

18

citizenship.

The college contends that the court of

Instead the court of appeals deferred to the

19
20

district court's largely unsupported prognostication that

21

the Rhode Island supreme court would apply the commercial

22

contract doctrine of substantial performance in the unique

23

context of the relationship between a college and a

24

student.

25

court say what its view would have been absent deference?

QUESTION:

Well, did the

MR. SNOW:

No.

3

QUESTION:

Did it say if we weren't, if we

4

weren't giving deference, here's what we think the law

5

means?

6

MR. SNOW:

No, Your Honor, the court did not

7

indicate which way they might rule absent deference.

8

they did indicate was that applying the traditional rule

9

of deference, they said the decision of the district court

What

10

was not reversible error.

11

decisions of the district court was a permissible rule of

12

law.

13

of law.

In other words, they said the

They didn't necessarily say it was the correct rule

14

After a brief review of the facts, I would like

15

to explain why we believe that every litigant is entitled

16

to a full, considered, and impartial review, that there is

17

no justification for being less thorough, for curtailing

18

any part of an appellant's — appellate rights or for a

19

court of appeals to abrogate any part of its appellate

20

responsibility simply because the law involved is State

21

law rather than Federal law.

22

25

QUESTION:

Do you think there's any -- would you

be making the same argument if we had done the same thing?
MR. SNOW:

No, Your Honor, I think that clearly

this Court, because of judicial economy, must defer to the

QUESTION:

Do you think the court of appeals are

3

bound independently to interpret State statutes in, in

diversity cases?

5

MR. SNOW:

That's correct.

That's our position.

6

The — this case arose in a rather exotic

7

factual context.

The respondent matriculated to Salve

Regina College as a freshman.

9

she applied to become a candidate in the, in the college's

During the freshman year

10

department of nursing, a candidate for a nursing degree.

11

She began her nursing studies as a sophomore.

12

Right from the first day of her nursing studies,

13

when the faculty was explaining to students their

14

expectations of students, the faculty privately advised

15

the respondent that they felt that she could potentially

16

have problems in the clinical portions of the curriculum

17

in the future which -- the clinical portions would begin

18

during the junior year — because of a medical condition

that she had.

morbidly obese.

a person of her size and body build.

The respondent suffered from a rather

1

problem and they recommended that she seek treatment and

2

do what she could to attempt to solve this problem before

3

she started her clinical studies during her junior year.
Despite this advice the respondent did not seek

4
5

treatment.

In fact her condition became worse during the

6

time that she was a student at the college,

7

faculty predicted, in fact her size did become a problem

8

during the clinical training.

middle of her junior year when her senior clinical

As the

This culminated in the

10

instructor gave her what amounted to a failing clinical

11

evaluation, all for reasons that in some way or another

12

related to her weight.

13

of the college's longstanding policy that a failure in the

14

clinical program would mean dismissal from the program in

15

its entirety, the faculty met with the student and they

16

came to an agreement.

17

situation where the student's failure seemed to be related

18

to her weight, the college agreed that they would enter

19

into a formal agreement with the student under which the

20

student was allowed to continue in the program on a

21

probationary basis provided that she met certain

22

requirements and the requirements were that she enter into

23

a treatment program and that she lose a certain amount of

24

weight prior to entering the senior year clinical aspects

25

of the curriculum.

As a result, and as a result

Because this was an unusual

1

The record below reflects that although the

2

student began complying with the terms of this agreement,

3

after a short period of time, in fact, her compliance

4

stopped and the end result was that just prior to the

5

beginning of her senior it was very clear that not only

did she not meet the terms of the agreement, she didn't

7

come close to meeting the terms of the agreement.

8

point she was told that she could not enter the senior

9

year clinical aspects of the program.

At that

10

The respondent responded in two ways.

11

she transferred to another institution and sought medical

12

and psychological treatment which culminated in her

13

undergoing a rather radical surgical procedure which led

14

to her losing some 50 percent of her overweightness, after

15

which she did graduate and today is a nurse.'

16

First,

She also responded by filing a lawsuit against

17

Salve Regina on a wide variety of Federal and State law

18

claims, ranging from handicapped discrimination and

19

alleged due process violations to intentional infliction

20

of emotional distress.

except a simple State law breach of contract claim, were

dismissed either on summary judgment or were directed out

case and the procedural background of the case.
MR. SNOW:

Thank you, Your Honor.

The First

Circuit applied this rule of deference, what it called a

4

traditional rule of deference.

5

applied is an important rule.

6

applied to all diversity cases, which make up some 20 to

7

25 percent of the docket of the Federal district courts,

8

some 15 percent, of the docket of the court of appeals.

9

But it applies to other cases as well.

This rule that the circuit

It applies to a

10

whole variety of cases in which State law serves as the

11

rule of decision for one reason or another.

It's also important because --

MR. SNOW: . To some extent it would apply in a

bankruptcy case where there's a question of property

QUESTION:

Is there any authority where

20

deference is given to bankruptcy judges who have practiced

in the jurisdiction or are most of the reported cases just

MR. SNOW:

I don't recall seeing any particular

case that relates to bankruptcy judges.

could make an argument that this is -8

I take it the principle would be the

an — you could probably analogize a bankruptcy court

somewhat more to an administrative agency which, which at

6

least theoretically has a special expertise in that narrow

7

area.

8

in general.

9

That's not true when we're talking about State law

We believe that the rule of deference not only

10

is important but that it's ill-conceived.

11

really an exception to the historic approach taken by this

12

Court in which questions of law are reviewed de novo and

13

questions of fact are reviewed for clear error.

14

questions that are, are subject to the sound discretion of

15

the district court are reviewed for abuse of discretion.

16

QUESTION:

In fact, it's

And

Well, as a practical matter don't you

17

think most of the circuits have for years pretty much gone

18

along with the interpretation of State law given by the

19

district judge who is often from that State and perhaps

20

familiar with the State law?

21

MR. SNOW:

I think it's —

I would agree, Justice O'Connor-, that

22

it is true that the majority of courts of appeals have

23

applied this rule of deference.

so — and — the rule of deference started shortly after

the Erie case was decided in 1938.

announced by the Eighth Circuit.

4

court of appeals that has given a considered analysis of

5

why the rule of deference is applied.

6

citation to authority of this Court which I would suggest

7

is inappropriate, since this Court is a court of limited

8

jurisdiction designed to handle cases of --

9

QUESTION:

I think it was first
There's never been any

Rather, their

Well, do you think it's just a common

10

sense sort of a feeling that the district court judge may

11

be more familiar with what the State law is than the

12

circuit court judges generally, who may or may not come

13

from that State?

14

MR. SNOW:

I think that's correct.

I think

15

that's what the rule is based on, but I would submit that

16

that's not a very sound rationale.

17

a district court judge may have some heightened

18

familiarity with some aspects of State law, I would

19

suggest that State law today is so complex that it's

20

unreasonable to assume that any district judge or any

21

practitioner has a meaningful level of expertise in all

22

areas of State law that would outweigh the tremendous

23

advantages I suggest that a court of appeals has in

24

deciding questions of law.

25

QUESTION:

While it is true that

Well, then you would suggest that

1

because of this complexity of State law today, that a

2

court of appeals, not just the First Circuit with four

3

States in it, but a court of appeals like the Ninth

4

Circuit with maybe 10 or 11 States in it should try to

5

decide as an original matter questions from those 11 or 12

6

States.

7

MR. SNOW:

Well, of course, I'm — we're not

8

suggesting deciding it necessarily as an original matter.

9

What we're suggesting is is that they would review the

10

decision of the district court.

11

particular deference, but certainly the district court's

12

decision ought to be considered.

13

QUESTION:

Not give it any

Ought it to be treated any

14

differently than a district court's decision on a point of

15

Federal law?

16
17

MR. SNOW:

We believe not.

We believe it ought

to be the same.

18

QUESTION:

No, no deference at all then?

19

MR. SNOW:

No deference at all to a district

20

court's decision.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what if it's a tie?

22

MR. SNOW:

Well, if it's a tie, then I -- it

23

would be the same rule, I believe, if it was a question of

24

Federal law.

decide it yourself or do you flip a coin?

MR. SNOW:

3

Or do you get

Well, I suppose if it's a tie, one,

4

one possibility would be to certify the question to the

5

highest court of the State, where you could get a

6

definitive ruling of State law.

7
8

QUESTION:

Do you have a certification procedure

in this State,1 in Rhode Island?

9

MR. SNOW:

Yes, there is.

Yes, there is.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Snow, I sat on the court of

11

appeals for a decade and I can remember in that court when

12

we had a -judge from outside the circuit sitting by

13

designation and yet the court of appeals would defer to

14

him on a matter of State law in the place where he was

15

sitting by designation.

MR. SNOW:

It doesn't make any sense, does

The court of appeals would defer to

the district court judge who was sitting on the court of

QUESTION:

No, who was sitting by designation as

a trial judge in a State where he did not come from.

MR. SNOW:

I agree.

(Laughter.)

3

MR. SNOW:

I would suggest that not only is —

4

QUESTION:

Of course, that's not exactly the

5

typical case even.

Most district judges are residenced

6

where they sit, aren't they?

7

MR. SNOW:

Most district judges are.

8

QUESTION:

Yeah.

9

MR. SNOW:

Of course, not all of them

10

necessarily practice law in that jurisdiction.

11

there are district judges who came up from the ranks of

12

U.S. attorneys —
QUESTION:

13

I mean,

W^ll, most of them practiced

14

law -- most of them practiced law in the jurisdiction

15

where they sit.

16

MR. SNOW:

Most of them did.

17

QUESTION:

There are very few judges on the

Illinois district courts who didn't practice, in fact,

19

there are none who didn't practice in Illinois, same in

1

not in the civil area at all, isn't that true?

2

MR. SNOW:

That, that is also true.

3

QUESTION:

Furthermore, the question is even if

4

you practice law in that area -- I practiced law in Rhode

5

Island for 15 years and I feel that I have a certain

6

amount of familiarity with some aspects of State law.

7

compared with the advantages that a court of appeals has

8

with respect to having a multijudge panel reviewing the

9

case; you have the parties fully briefing the issues that

But

10

the district court does not have; there is the luxury of

11

time to some extent, and I'm not suggesting the court of

12

appeals aren't very busy.

13

judge has to accomplish, since the district judge's job is

14

primarily conducting trials and receiving evidence and

15

deciding factual issues —

16

QUESTION:

But compared to what a district

Well, just on that very point, you

17

had mentioned earlier certification and here when Judge

18

Selya had to explain why he was going to let this issue go

19

to the jury, he made a long explanation of what he was

20

going to do, did you ask to have the question certified

21

then and would you propose that the district judge should

22

interrupt the trial to certify the question?

23

MR. SNOW:

We did not ask the district judge to

24

certify the question at that time.

25

came up only at the end of the case.

In fact, the question

1

QUESTION:

If, if you had thought of it at that

2

time, do you think it would have been prudent for him to

3

interrupt the trial to take the time to certify to the

4

Rhode Island supreme court?

5

MR. SNOW:

I think it would not have been

6

prudent in the context of a jury trial at that time;

7

however, I think it might have been prudent for the court

8

of appeals to -have certified the question to the Rhode

9

Island district court.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

So the district judge kind of axed it

as peril, is what it amounts to I guess.
MR. SNOW:

I think if the issue had come up

13

pretrial, then it very well could have been certified to

14

the court of appeals.

15

up — neither of the parties raised this issue of

16

substantial performance.

17

motion for directed verdict and the court raised it sui

18

sponte, suggesting that the trial judge had been a State

19

court judge for a period of time and he stated that he

20

felt that he had some intuitive feeling for how the Rhode

21

Island supreme court might handle that issue and decided

22

it at that time.

The way the issue came

It came up during argument on a

consider the issue thoroughly.

considering the -- that focused legal issue.

QUESTION:

In contrast to a court of

But he did raise it the day before he

made his ruling, didn't he?

6

MR. SNOW:

Yes, he did.

7

QUESTION:

He raised it and then he announced it

8

the next day. •

9

MR. SNOW:

That is correct.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. SNOW:

And we did — and we did present the

12

district court with the findings of our research, which

13

was to the effect that no -- we could no court anywhere in

14

the country, let alone Rhode Island, that applied the

15

commercial contract doctrine of substantial performance to

16

the academic relationship between the student and the

17

college.

18

QUESTION:

Don't, don't you think it's

19

reasonable, Mr. Snow, for, for a court of appeals to say

20

that a judge who is sitting in Rhode Island and who has

21

practiced in Rhode Island may well have a feel for what

22

the Rhode Island supreme court would do, that you

23

can't -- that judges who have never practiced there can't

24

get by just reading the decisions of that court?

25

MR. SNOW:

I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

It seems to me that if we take that approach, we've come

2

full circle with the Erie doctrine, we're back to Swift v.

Tyson.

brief — we're engaged in fourth-dimensional reasoning to

5

some transcendent principles of truth and justice.

6

sounds very much like a brooding omnipresence of general

7

law hanging over the United States.

We're looking -- as the respondent states in his

That

8

I think the essence of the Erie doctrine is that

the law is determinable, State law is determinable and can

be communicated by lawyers to judges, Federal judges no

less than State judges, and appellate judges no less than

of citizenship test at the time and the fact of the matter

17

is that the trial calendar in the Federal court in

Providence was a more rapidly reached trial than what we

19

in the State supreme court, the superior court — our

20

superior court in the State court has a crowded calendar

21

of some 4 to 5 years to a trial and fortunately the

their cases out within 12 to 18 months.

It

languished for a long time, because Judge Selya had the
matter when he was a district judge and reserved decision
on the motion for a summary judgment, and that took some
period of time before that decision came down, and when he
did come down with his decision, he said he would hold the
case and try it himself when he could get off the circuit
court long enough to hear it at the district court level.

And some year and a half went by while he tried
to do that and ultimately he had to excuse himself.

And

that's why it ultimately was tried by a different judge.
So the delay in the actual trial of the case was one that
occurred because a Federal judge was trying to accommodate
a calendar situation.
But had -- these cases set absolutely no
precedent, and it seems to me that when you turn around
and say to judges on circuit courts that are already
overburdened, trying to find time to write opinions in
cases that do set precedent, that when you agree with the
district judge that he was right in his interpretation and
his guess as to what a State supreme court would do, that
'if you require them to set down and write these long
opinions proving 2 and 2 are 4 or reinventing the wheel,

One of the telling points that was tried to be

11

made by the circuit court of the Ninth Circuit in the

McLinn case was that failing to give this type of

full-blown, full-scale legal review to unsettled law

questions would be an advocation of their authority and

their position as such, and unfair to the litigants.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

of constitutional law in this case and I respectfully

differ to the extent that Erie does state a rule of

that implies that de novo review is required.
