MR. SIEGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court this morning is

12

whether an unreviewed state administrative agency finding

nothing in the legislative history of the ADEA or on the

face of the statute would dictate otherwise.

effectuate Congress' stated purpose in eliminating age

discrimination.

(800). FOR DEPO

In his

1

presumption.

In Elliott, with respect to Title VII, the

2

Court defined the applicable test by stating the question

3

actually before us is whether a common law rule of

4

preclusion would be consistent with congressional intent.

5

It was found not to be consistent with congressional

6

intent in Title VII for two reasons, both of which are

7

absent from the ADEA.
First was that a substantial weight clause had

8

9

been added in 1972 to Title VII which explicitly stated

10

how much weight should be given to a finding by a state

11

agency.

12

less weight or no weight, but now a maximum had been set.

13

The second was this Court's decision in Chandler, which

14

again was based substantially upon the 1972 amendments to

15

Title VII.

Before the EEOC was free to give more weight or

16

Both of those are absent from the ADEA.
In Elliott this Court went on to state that a

17

claim under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, the Post-Civil War

18

Act, was barred by an administrative finding, that

19

preclusion was appropriate because there was nothing in

20

the statute or its legislative history to indicate

21

otherwise.

The Court cited Allen for the proposition
«

22

23

supporting that administrative preclusdon.
QUESTION:

Mr. Siegel, do you take the position

24

that Congress has to speak expressly to the issue of

25

preclusion in order to overcome any common law presumption

about it?
MR. SIEGEL:

It is our position that Congress

3

must in some specific manner, yes, state that preclusion

4

should not apply.

5

It need not use those —

QUESTION:

Have our cases ever said that, or

6

have we just found for a variety of reasons that there may

7

not be preclusion or there is?

8

9

MR. SIEGEL:

You are correct that the rule was

done by the Court depending on each specific statute.

The

10

closest analogy might be this Court's recent decision in

11

Aramco involving, while it wasn't preclusion, it certainly

12

was another doctrine of, in that case against

extraterritoriality.

that specific in this area, do you?

The Court required a rather specific

There is —
You would have us apply the same kind

of presumption we did in Aramco?
MR. SIEGEL:

Yes.

I would ask the Court to look

21

to find a specific evidence of congressional intent either

22

in the statute or in its legislative history.

23

QUESTION:

Do we owe any deference to the EEOC

on this point?
MR. SIEGEL:

MR. SIEGEL:

The statute provides no finding, no

basis for the EEOC to make findings.

indications that we should, we should find a requirement

is that there was not in this case, as there was in the

2

Title VII case, a specific provision requiring the EEOC in

3

making its findings to give substantial weight to state

4

determinations?

Right?

5

MR. SIEGEL:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SIEGEL:

8

Yes.
You rely on the absence of that here.
I believe the absence of it, as the

Eighth Circuit said in Stillians, is very significant —

9

QUESTION:

But you now tell us that there is no

10

reason for such a provision to exist here, because on your

11

view the EEOC has no authority to make findings anyway.

12

So why would such a provision possibly be here?

13

MR. SIEGEL:

I may not be following your

14

question, but I believe that the ADEA's lack of any basis

15

for limiting or providing a maximum states no

16

congressional intent to limit the state's agency's effect,

17

just as there was no limit to the effect in the 1983

18

claim.

19

QUESTION:

Wait.

You find it significant that

20

there is not in this statute a provision requiring the

21

EEOC to defer to state findings.

22

significant tjiat that is missing, although it was present

23

in Title VII, right?

MR. SIEGEL:

QUESTION:

7

That's correct.
But here it's not supposed to make

findings, factual findings, according to you.
MR. SIEGEL:

That also is correct.

It's not in

the statute.
QUESTION:

If it's not supposed to make factual

8

findings, why would you expect to see the same kind of

9

provision you had in Title VII?

1

MR. SIEGEL:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SIEGEL:

The Congress —
You would not expect to find it.
I would certainly not expect to

13

find it, nor is there any other language in the ADEA which

14

would limit application of administrative preclusion.

15

You're correct in that there is no, if there is no

16

findings to be made there is certainly no limit or maximum

17

to those findings.

18

had been in Title VII, that there should be a maximum for

19

the state's administrative finding to be given.

20

But there is no other indication, as

Administrative preclusion would achieve certain

21

very significant goals.

One would be to avoid

22

relitigation of claims.

It would avoid the parties being

twice faced with exhaustive proceedings.

MR. SIEGEL:

The Utah Mining and Elliott speak

about a rule of preclusion that has been applied.
QUESTION:

Well, but Elliott doesn't say

anything about a presumption in favor.

Federal common law rules of preclusion in the absence of a

It quotes some of

12

MR. SIEGEL:

I don't

I may have overstated it, but the

Court in Utah Mining and in Elliott has gone forward in

14

the absence of congressional language to the contrary to

apply a rule of preclusion.

that it would not be preclusive as to the EEOC itself.

instead of the EEOC in the first instance to move Federal

that's the explanation of why —

MR. FLAMM:

1

The point that the petitioner made

2

in his brief was that the only kind of cases in which

3

there would be a quick termination would be those in which

4

the state agency abandoned the processing for some reason

5

or the grievant just looking around decided that his case

is not worth pursuing in this forum and he took some kind

7

of voluntary dismissal, assuming the state procedures

allowed that.

The reason for

having the state proceedings extinguished upon the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

not.

Now, in Elliott the Court reasoned by inference from,

largely from a provision that said nothing about the

weight that courts give to state agency findings.

16

part in Elliott addressed itself to the weight that the

the so-called deferral provision.

12

argument, Congress clearly contemplated that there would

Section 7(d).

The age act permits simultaneous

or successive consideration of a complaint by a state or

decides to file with a state agency first, then he must

file his complaint with the EEOC within 30 days of a final

contemplates an EEOC investigation and conciliation of a

Therefore the statute clearly

Now, if that decision had preclusive effect,

And let me tell you why.

If there was a finding of no discrimination by

'

Ms. Wax, what authority does the EEOC

MS. WAX:

The age act does not explicitly

provide authority for the EEOC to make findings in so many

words, and it differs from Title VII in that Title VII,

7

the sections of Title VII that govern the EEOC's role do

8

speak of a probable cause determination or no probable

9

cause determination.

However, the EEOC has decided to

10

make findings.

11

make findings, because it has discovered that it's very

12

difficult to solve a discrimination problem and get a

conciliation agreement if you don't know what the problem

is.

15

In practice the EEOC does investigate and

expertise than the agency that had it since i958, the New
