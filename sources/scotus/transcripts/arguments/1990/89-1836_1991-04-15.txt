The Court

MR. TIGAR:

19

client, Grady Sanders, as a suspect.

polygraph tests.

court appearance, a trial date was set that he then knew

2

would be more than 6 months in the future.

3

before arraignment he went to the library and researched

4

the law on what he could and could not say.

5

the hearing shows what he read, including, by the way,

6

what was at that time the American Bar Association's

7

inconsistent position, on the one hand the clear and

8

present danger test, and on one hand the tendency test.

The night

In his presentation which is video taped and

available to the Court and is in the appendix to the

evidence would show.

The bar's charges

1

Well, how much does a defense lawyer

have to prove at trial in order for a defendant to be

acquitted?

It could simply be a failure of the

QUESTION:

The burden — the burden is on the

State.
MR. TIGAR:

It could be.

Chief Justice.

The burden rests on the State, Mr.

In this particular trial, the cross

10

examination of Government witnesses is — which of course

11

defense counsel almost always does — always does in my

12

experience — brought out the vital admission that these

13

police officers were doing exactly what Mr. Gentile said

14

they were.

15

that way in that case in addition to the defense evidence.

16

They were using narcotics.

So it came out in

But it is important to stress that Mr. Gentile

17

did not say anything at that conference which under any

18

view of the trial would not be admissible in evidence,

19

because what he was focusing on were the charges against

20

his client and the fundamental defects in the Government's

21

proof.

Now, at the hearing in this case based on these

23

charges, they singled out six separate parts of the

affirming said, and I quote,

"The evidence demonstrated

that there was no actual prejudice in this case."

here, if the Court please, because the respondent has

conjured for the Court a collision between the First and

5

the Sixth Amendments.

6

expressly on two occasions and consistently wisely refused

7

to find, saying in the Nebraska Press case that the

8

framers intended no hierarchy between First and Sixth

9

Amendment rights, and saying, in Bridges v. California

We are

A collision that this Court has

10

where this line of authority begins, that the Court will

11

not make a forced choice between the First and the Sixth

12

Amendments.

13

The respondents conjure this collision by

14

inviting the Court, we suggest, to ignore the working

15

principles to which this Court referred at page 845 of its

16

opinion in Landmark.

17

made clear at page 843 of that opinion, rest upon the

18

clear and present danger test but did not require a

mechanical application of it.

9

Well, Mr. Tigar, here we're dealing

MR. TIGAR:

That's my understanding, Justice

0'Connor.
QUESTION:

And part 1 of that says that a lawyer

shall not make an extra judicial statement if the lawyers

10

knows or reasonably should know that it will have a

11

substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an

12

adjudicative proceeding.

13

that that provision is invalid as a matter of

14

constitutional law?

15

MR. TIGAR:

Now, do you take the position

Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do.

We

16

take that position because we agree with the American Bar

17

Association, which doesn't support the outcome here but

18

supports the rule, that it doesn't embody the clear and

19

present danger standard.

20

violates what the Court said in Landmark.

21

QUESTION:

And to that extent we say that

And is this provision, part 1 of rule
A

22

177, rather typical of what many States have in their

23

rules governing attorney conduct?

24

MR. TIGAR:

25

of what many States have done.

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is typical

QUESTION:

2

MR. TIGAR:

So they're all invalid?
Any rule that does not embody the

3

clear and present danger standard would be invalid under

4

our view, Justice O'Connor.

5

to point out that this would not be the first time that

6

the Court has had to say to the bar that the First

7

Amendment doesn't stop short of its door.

8

9

And I think it is important

Again, however, the problem, Justice O'Connor,
is not simply a facial invalidity.

It is not simply

10

overbreadth but vagueness.

11

Gentile consulted the night before that are in that

12

Exhibit D point out, there is judicial disagreement.

13

There is disagreement among even the ABA standards.

14

do you know what to do?

15

Justice O'Connor, from a reading of subparagraphs two and

16

three, which in an attempt to clarify matters only add to

17

the difficulties.

QUESTION:

As the materials that Mr.

more typical provision.

MR. TIGAR:

And I was trying

Yes, Justice O'Connor, and our

position on that is clear.

But we do find a problem with many of the rules

QUESTION:

In — in your view, Mr. Tigar, if the

Court makes a ruling on a motion in limine that it's not

7

to be brought out that a lie detector test has been

8

given — trial is ongoing, can an attorney go out in the

9

corridor at recess time and tell the press that there was

10

lie detector test that the witness had failed?
MR. TIGAR:

11

Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy.

12

That's the kind of a mid-trial order or a pretrial order

13

that takes account of the concrete dangers to the jury

14

process.

QUESTION:

15
16

That's the sort of order that the court -Suppose the jury had been

sequestered.

17

MR. TIGAR:

There might be less danger under

such circumstances, but Justice Kennedy, I would submit

19

that there a court could well find that the clear and

present danger nonetheless exists, because we all --

Justice Kennedy, I've tried some

Well, is the -- is the only clear and

jury will receive information that it ought not to have?

9

MR. TIGAR:

No, there are other dangers to the

trial process, although once you get away from impact on

11

the jury's deliberations, they are considerably more

12

attenuated.

QUESTION:

Well, what are the other dangers of

15

the trial process if an attorney reveals the contents of

16

matters that the judge in limine has instructed the

17

attorney shall not mention in the courtroom?

18

MR. TIGAR:

The Court's opinion in Alderman

19

against United States referred to two of. them; national

20

security and the rights of third parties, suggesting that

21

protective orders were necessary there.

22

Seattle Times v. Rhinehart referred to protective orders

23

in the civil discovery process which often implicates the

24

privacy rights of strangers to the litigation in a way

25

that oughtn't to be compromised for the sake of the

QUESTION:

3

So rights of third parties tested

under the clear and present danger test?
MR. TIGAR:

4

I think not, Justice Kennedy,

5

because at least to the extent that they do not involve

6

core speech on matters of public concern.

7

the Court presents such core speech on a matter of public

8

concern.

9

certainly which is a routine run-of-the-mind protective

The case before

The Court has not suggested either in Alderman,

10

order, or in Seattle Times that the clear and present

11

danger test is appropriate.

12

that the Court need not adopt it in order to reach the

13

result that we contend for with respect to the speech in

14

issue.
QUESTION:

15

And we certainly would say

Well, if — if you say that the court

16

can protect the rights of third parties by disciplining or

17

ordering an attorney not to discuss certain matters, then

18

I take it the attorney does have some special obligations

19

to the court that others do not.
MR. TIGAR:

20

Is that correct?

That is absolutely correct, Justice

21

Kennedy.

of candor to the tribunal, among others.

MR. TIGAR:

I will grant you it is less, but

No, it is extremely significant,

Justice Souter, and there is an additional reason.

When a

judge speaks out, the judge may very well trigger a motion

11

to recuse the judge or his or her colleagues for bias.

12

But to come back to the issue which I think is

You are — you are agreeing that

of a deliberative process, and that that value in fact can

be infringed by comments whether it be by lawyers or by

judges so that our whole test is not simply going to be

the effect on the jury.

Now, assuming that to be the

10

case, how do we — how do we as a practical matter apply

11

the clear and present danger test when a judge or a lawyer

12

makes a statement which tends to suggest or cast doubt on

13

the fairness and the deliberativeness of the process?

14

do we assess the clarity and the presence of the danger?

MR. TIGAR:

How

looking not at legislative-type findings such as embodied

The fact that the public's business is at stake

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. KLONOFF
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KLONOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We submit that the Nevada Supreme Court's
private reprimand of petitioner is correct and should be
affirmed.

First, lawyers in pending cases are officers of

the court and can be subject to certain restrictions that
could not be imposed on the press.

Second, Nevada rule

177, substantial likelihood of material prejudice
standard, captures this simple premise that a lawyer
should not be allowed to try his case on the press.
Third, the rule was properly applied here because
petitioner called the press conference for the precise
purpose of prejudicing prospective jurors.

And he argued

extensively concerning the credibility and character of
the Government's witnesses and on other matters.
Now petitioner takes the position —

Is it undisputed that he purpose was

QUESTION:

Well, I ask you though about In re

MR. KLONOFF:

7

Yes, it did.

Petitioner in his brief goes on at length trying to

17

criticize these guidelines, but in fact this was an

18

extraordinary effort of the bar over many years, guided in

fact by this Court's decision in Sheppard against Maxwell,

not only to set a substantial likelihood of prejudice

standard but to do so in a way that lawyers will really

22

understand what is permitted and what is not permitted.

Now, under Mr. Tigar's standard that would not

that prospective juror, all you'd have to do is find that

there's no actual prejudice to the outcome.

QUESTION:

Let me reframe the question.

In this

particular case, is there any reason to believe that voir

based on what the police had already said to the press?

the general community than there already was.

3

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, his very admission that he

4

was trying to counteract is not an exception.

5

know where he gets that from as an exception to the rule.

6

It is not an exception because you believe one side has

violated the rule that you're allowed to do so.

QUESTION:

No, it isn't that.

I don't

It's — your

argument is that his conference made it necessary to have

a more extensive or — the danger was you might have a

more extensive voir dire than otherwise.

MR. KLONOFF:

QUESTION:

That was the danger --

And if you already needed that

14

extensive voir dire because of what the prosecutor,and the

15

police had said, isn't that a response to the concern?

16

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, that's not a response here.

17

For example, jurors may have — may have seen or recalled

individual jurors about what they remember about his press

So, yes, there could be prejudice — new

prejudice that has nothing to do with what the prosecutor
had said before.

But —

QUESTION:

Would it — would it have violated

the rule if you had — say it was a murder case, and the
defense lawyer got up to counteract the publicity -highly publicized murder case and said, our defense is
going to be alibi.

We have six witnesses — I'll name

them — who will testify that he was in London at the time
of the alleged incident.

Let me say in closing that in 1966 this Court in

8

Sheppard against Maxwell went to great lengths to get the

9

bar in the process of coming to where we are today to

10

adopt rules.

At the time of Sheppard against Maxwell, you

11

had canon 20 in a number of States but it had really no

12

teeth to it in substance.
This Court told the bars that told the States to

13
14

get serious.

15

Either this rule or a rule more restrictive of speech is

16

in effect in well over 40 States as we've detailed in our

17

brief responsive to the concerns that this Court has

18

raised.

19

The rule in effect here is now in effect.

These rules have worked well.

They've been in

place for close to two decades throughout the country.

There has not been serious problem with administering

these rules.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TIGAR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. TIGAR:

In 1981, the ABA drafts group, as

10

pointed out at footnote 19 of our reply brief, did say

11

that the standard in this rule is equivalent to clear and

We disagree
