April 18, 1988, two officers were on routine patrol in an

unmarked car in Oakland when they turned a corner to see,

So the exclusionary rule should not

apply to attempted illegal conduct by the police?

It does not violate — that's right,

Is there anything in the record to

was a bag of 15 rocks, but they were never found to be

The only

Continuing on the matter of the elements of a

17

seizure, this Court has acknowledged, has defined a

18

seizure in its case law as composed of two distinct

19

elements:

20

movement of the citizen at whom the action is directed.

21

That has been the rule since Terry v. Ohio defined a

22

seizure as physical force or show of authority which has

23

restrained the liberty of a citizen.

24

Court has found -- had occasion to define the parameters

25

of both elements.

1

With regard to the requirement of a display of

2

authority, this Court has said, beginning in a plurality

3

of cases, of Mendenhall and Royer, and concluding with

4

Delgado and Chesternut, that an objective standard

5

requires the question whether an official action was such

that a reasonable person would have believed that he or

9

is conceptually incorrect.

10

Mendenhall and its progeny did

not dispense with the requirement of restraint.

i

Respondent suggests that that

This may be illustrated by a simple example.

If

12

an officer says to a pedestrian, stop in the name of the

13

law, and the person flees, never to be caught, he has not

14

been seized in any physical or constitutional sense.

QUESTION:

So if this man understood the chase

to be a show of authority where he was attempting to catch

him, then it would be a seizure and it would have been an

illegal seizure?

throwing the gun away?

Mr. Niver, you're saying, if I

conduct by them, unless that unlawful conduct constitutes

The court of appeal applied the proper test here.

We urge

this Court to defer to the court of appeal's application
of the proper standard to this fact-specific situation.
The objective characteristics of this pincer movement
which resulted in the blocking of Hodari's path meets the
standards this Court has set forth to define a seizure by
a show of authority.

We urge this Court not to repudiate

the Mendenhall-Chesternut standard with a bright line
rule.

We respectfully request that this Court affirm the

court of appeals' decision.
