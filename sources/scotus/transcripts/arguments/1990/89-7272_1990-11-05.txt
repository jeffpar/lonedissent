Ms. Johnson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA J. JOHNSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. JOHNSON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about the most severe penalty,

10
11

short of death, coupled with a total lack of discretion at

12

any critical stage in the sentencing process.

13

petitioner, Ronald Harmelin, was convicted of possession

14

of over 650 grams of cocaine in Michigan.

15

16

parole ever.

1

commutation of sentences by the Governor or something of

2

that sort?

3

Pardon or a commutation?
MS. JOHNSON:

Every State in the Nation has

4

commutation by the Governor for any crime, whether it be a

5

mass murderer or a serial rapist.

6

7

QUESTION:

MS. JOHNSON:

It is — it is -- it has never

been used in a drug offender scenario by our Governor.
QUESTION:

10
11

Is that ever — is that a provision

that is used on occasion in Michigan?

8
9

But —

Is it used in some circumstances in

Michigan?
MS. JOHNSON:

12

It has been used very infrequently

13

in Michigan.

14

said that the mere ad hoc chance of executive clemency is

15

not' enough to preclude Eighth Amendment review, because if

16

it was the Eighth Amendment review would be meaningless.

17

Our Governor does not have a history of pardoning people,

18

however.

19

However, this Court in Solem v. Helm has

Seven years ago, this Court in Solem v. Helm

20

fashioned a proportionality test to determine whether a

21

sentence is proportional to the crime.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Johnson, Solem against Helm

23

was a 5 to 4 decision, and it cut back on Rummel against

24

Estelle, which was also a 5 to 4 decision.

25

the Court has reached equilibrium, or do you think that

Do you think

1

more changes might take place?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MS. JOHNSON:

4
5

I don't think that this Court

should treat stare decisis too cavalierly.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think they did treat it

6

— how do you think they treated stare decisis in Solem

7

against Helm?

8

MS. JOHNSON:

9

reversed or even narrowed Rummel.

I don't think that Solem v. Helm
I think the facts in

10

Rummel, who was eligible for parole and was going to be

11

paroled within 10 or 12 years, was the whole difference.

12

We're talking about a case where a person is in mandatory

13

— with mandatory life with no parole ever.

14

whole different thing than somebody that serves a life

15

sentence and is eligible after 10 years.

16

QUESTION:

That is a

I think —

You see no conflict in the reasoning

17

of the cases?

18

difficult to square, so far as their approach and their

19

reasoning are concerned.

20

I must submit I think the cases are

MS. JOHNSON:

Well, the majority in Solem v.

21

Helm said that there was no conflict.

22

difference was that in Solem v. Helm the person was -- Mr.

23

Helm was sentenced to mandatory life with no parole, which

24

is different in kind than a sentence of life where you can

25

be paroled.

They said that the

minority in Rummel v. Helm -- or, no, the — in Rummel v.

2

Helm the majority of this Court said that a ticket, a

parking ticket -- if someone was sentenced to life in

4

prison for a parking ticket, that would be

5

disproportionate.

6

reverse Solem v. Helm, I don't think you would necessarily

7

have to throw out the whole proportionality test.

8

9

So I don't think that — if you were to

But going back to the test, the three factors
that were used are the harshness of the penalty, the

10

gravity of the offense, what other States do with your

11

crime and what your State does with other crimes.

12

those in reverse order, Michigan is way out of line with

13

every other State in the union.

14

with what the Federal statutes are.

15

States, the majority of the States have sentences for

16

possession of 650 grams somewhere between 0 and 10 years,

17

and all of the States have discretion somewhere to factor

18

in the mitigating factors, whether the person is a first

19

time offender, whether he is a minor participant, whether

20

there is some sort of violence or not, whether the person

21

is a drug addict.

1

Isn't, isn't a State entitled to feel more deeply about

2

some crimes than other States do?
MS. JOHNSON:

3

Yes.

I think States certainly can

4

create laws trying to solve problems, and Michigan does

5

have a big drug problem, as do California and D.C., some

other States who — that don't have those --

17

Why is that wrong?
MS. JOHNSON:

There are a couple answers to

18

that.

One is that a State can propose legislation, but it

19

still has to pass constitutional muster.

20

drugs we have to fight it with constitutional weapons.

21

And if a State is going to legislate against drugs, they

22

should — they should keep it within some sort of rational

basis.

2

possess the 650.

Oakland County is the richest county.

4

That is not out of the question.

QUESTION:

Most unlikely.

So what my —
You're not willing to

concede that having that much is very good indication that

6

it's not being held for personal consumption but for

distribution?

8

10

MS. JOHNSON:

The State didn't prove anything,

so my position is that my client has been convicted of
mere possession.

11

QUESTION:

Of an awfully large quantity of --

12

MS. JOHNSON:

I don't know if it's an awfully

13

large quantity.

In the Federal system in order to be a

14

kingpin under the criminal — Continuing Criminal

15

Enterprise statute a person has to have five people

16

working under him, he has to distribute 150 kilos of

17

cocaine in a year, or make $10 million, and have a

continuing criminal enterprise going.

MS. JOHNSON:

Ms. Johnson —

of things, I am not sure — I am sorry.
QUESTION:

At page 6 of the joint appendix the

And the presentence report

3

would have taken, been able to take that fact into

4

consideration, wouldn't he?

Now the judge, even in a different jurisdiction,

MS. JOHNSON:

5

That is correct.

The presentence

6

report did say that, and the reason it said it is because

7

Michigan defines a large-scale drug trafficker as someone

8

who possesses over 650.

the statute says that, you don't need this.

1

MS. JOHNSON:

I think you have to take as a fact

2

that that was in the presentence report, but I think you

3

have to take it -- you have to realize also that because

4

Michigan doesn't make any — any difference between a

5

major or a minor trafficker — anybody with 650 gets life

6

in prison — it discourages advocacy at the sentencing

7

proceeding.

8

by counsel was not.

9

QUESTION:

10

So something that would have been objected to
So -How do we know that?

MS. JOHNSON:

I guess we don't know that, and

11

that's the whole point.

You can — you can infer that

12

some things would not be objected to if it didn't make any

13

reason to object to them.

14

don't have any facts in front of you on this case — the

15

facts are pretty bare.

16

a person who is possessing 650 as a major trafficker, then

17

no one argues with that.

18

discourages advocacy at the sentencing level.

I don't think you can — you

But the fact that Michigan defines

There is no reason.

QUESTION:

MS. JOHNSON:

I think the

accurate or not, my position is that the very statute on

its face, because it is so broad, because it is possible

to sentence people who are traffickers, people who are

17

mules, people who are minor participants, or possessors —

18

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you, wouldn't you

19

think that if there was clear proof that here was a real

20

drug kingpin, that this mandatory sentence might be

21

constitutional as applied to him, and yet be quite

22

unconstitutional as applied to somebody else, some minor,

23

some person walking across the street as the delivery boy?

24

This isn't a First Amendment case that has over-breadth or

25

anything.

1

Well, there are some, there are

some problems with the over-breadth of the statute and

some presumptions in this statute as well.

this definitely would be cruel —

But this —

that the statute is necessarily, would necessarily be

unconstitutional on its face if this was really a drug

That would be a closer question.

Well, how would you answer the close

MS. JOHNSON:

In my view.

That's all?
In Michigan's view as

13

well, other than this 650 statute, first degree murder and

felony murder are punished with mandatory life in prison

with no parole.

the very elements of the crime narrow the class of people

QUESTION:

It's only about a decade or so ago

that we found in the Constitution a prohibition on
imposing capital punishment for anything except the
killing of a human being, and now you say that we also
can't impose life — it is also unconstitutional to impose
life imprisonment for anything except the taking of a
human life.

I sense a certain ratchet effect here.

MS. JOHNSON:

Well, you're — this Court has

said that the —
QUESTION:

What, what about 30 years to a 50

year old, or to a 60 year old?

Does that amount to life

imprisonment?
MS. JOHNSON:

I think the Court needs to have

some sort of discretion to decide whether the person under
this statute, whether they are a major or a minor
participant, whether they are a first time offender or
just a mule of transport.

But my main problem is with the

nonparolability.

is no discretion to decide the culpability of the person,

qualitatively different.

There is no way

So for that reason it is

And I feel that a statute that

has no discretion to decide who is going to be punished by
that statute, and coupled with the fact that he will die
in prison, makes it more like a death penalty case than
any other number of years.

And this Court has developed a

doctrine of constitutionality in the death penalty cases
for individualized sentencing.
As far as mandatory minimum sentencings, if they
are small, like 5 or 10 years, I don't have a position on
that because I haven't really studied that issue.
QUESTION:

Well, and yet you, I thought you said

a while ago that, but there are some crimes that, for
which a mandatory life sentence without parole is okay?
MS. JOHNSON:

Yes.

I think the intentional

taking of a human life is a crime that is universally held
to be that — to show that sort of depravity.
QUESTION:

Well, what about some very aggravated

recidivist situation, someone who four successive times
has committed aggravated rape, or has committed mayhem?

You really can't say that life imprisonment is different.

Life imprisonment for a 20 year old is no different from a

MS. JOHNSON:

Life imprisonment —

How can we say that — I mean, if the

criterion is whether you will die in prison, a mandatory

life sentence is no different from a mandatory term of

if you say that this is based on some societal consensus,

I have no evidence that that consensus exists.

10

MS. JOHNSON:

I was taking that from the Coker

case, where the — this Court said that rape was different

12

than intentional taking of human life, and so the sentence

13

of death was unconstitutional for a person who was

14

convicted of rape.

15

In Michigan it is clear that serious criminal acts, such

16

as rape, second degree murder, and armed robbery, are

17

punished with less severity than possession of cocaine.

18

So you have vicious people, dangerous criminals who are

When a major trafficker is caught in a State court, the

And in fact in this case the defendant admits in the

QUESTION:

3

Now —

But let, let me go back to my

example.

Does the Michigan law read that if he possesses

5

650 with intent to distribute, it is life without parole,

6

and if he possesses 650, period, it is life without

7

parole?

8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, that pretty much destroys the

10

suggestion I made a moment ago, doesn't it, that the real

11

point of the law was to identify these people?

12

the, the law seems to be drawing a distinction that does

13

not, that is not consistent with the distinction that I

14

was making.
MR. THOMPSON:

15

Because

I think that, not trying to read

16

what the legislature was thinking when they did that,

17

there is no difference as far as the penalty goes.

18

do believe that the legislature was identifying, as you

19

No, Your Honor.

They have had

these, those kinds of crimes for a long time.

back in 1977 the legislature started to hold hearings,

public hearings across the State trying to address the

problem of drugs.

QUESTION:

However,

And they listened to the community.
And you say that they enacted

simultaneously two statutes, one of which says you get

life for possessing 650 grams with intent to distribute,

and in addition, at the same time, the same legislature

10

drafted another statute that said you get 650 for

11

possessing 650 — or you get —
MR. THOMPSON:

12

It was a part of the same act.

13

However, as you go down further, when you get below 50

14

grams, then the penalties do change.

15

possession of less than 50, 50 grams, you have a 4-year

16

possibility of sentence, but if you possess with intent to

deliver, then the penalty is more.
