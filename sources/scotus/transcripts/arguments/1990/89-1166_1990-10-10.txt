Mr. Gold, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

Let's have order in the Court and no talking in

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GOLD:

Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case, like the preceding case, is one in

13

thereafter the similarities cease rather than arising

14

under title VII.

This case arises under section 301

The agreement contains a grievance procedure

7

which specifies that — it is the method for treating

8

disagreements as to the interpretation and application of

9

the agreement.

The grievance procedure provides for 4

10

steps of conciliation and discussion, provides that the

11

parties may agree to arbitration for certain matters,

12

provides that an agreement reached between the employer

13

and — the union during the grievance procedure is binding

14

and is silent on what the status of the situation is in

15

the event that the parties do not come to an agreement

16

about what the contract means.
In addition, this agreement has an express no­

strike clause.

19

an exception for a strike or a lockout over an unresolved

20

grievance.

21

the agreement is totally silent on whether there is an

option where no resolution of the matter is reached in the

last stage of the grievance procedure.

the agreement as properly construed and entered into.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, if suit is brought, do you

3

consider the grievance, by reason of the bringing of the

4

suit, to still be an unresolved grievance?

5

MR. GOLD:

I -- I regard it as being an

6

unresolved grievance until the Court speaks and determines

7

whether the grievance is properly grounded in the contract

8

or whether the employer's action was consistent with the

9

contract and does not constitute a breach of the contract.
QUESTION:

10
11

a strike to occur?
MR. GOLD:

12

13

When does the no-strike clause allow

The no-strike clause allows a strike

to occur at the completion of the fourth step.

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

MR. GOLD:

So, it does --

QUESTION:

Where is the no-strike clause in —■

17

MR. GOLD:

Look at the -- page 34, the no-strike

18

clause, which is section 7 on page 34 of the joint

19

appendix, the buff-colored book says, until all

20

negotiations, there shall be no strikes, et cetera.

21

QUESTION:

Where is that on the page, Mr. Gold?

22

MR. GOLD:

It is at the bottom of the page,

24

to strike.

11

MR. GOLD:

QUESTION:

And you're saying there can be a

strike to prevent the company from doing what the court

will say or is being asked to say it has a contractual

And it works the opposite where, you know --

MR. GOLD:

That's right.

17

QUESTION:

-- where — where there's a lockout.

18

The employer is locking out the union, because the union

19

is asserting a contractual right which a court is being

asked to affirm.

judicial decision would be enjoinable.

QUESTION:

And so in effect you think the

1

of — first of all there was no strike here, so we're not

2

dealing with the question in this particular case of the

3

interplay between the right to get a judicial

4

determination on the meaning of the contract and whether

5

the contract is more than a collection of words which have

6

no purpose when the push comes to the shove and whether a

7

union or an employer can go down both options at the same

8

time.

9

The company's position here is that this

10

silence '—■ the creation of this grievance procedure which

11

ends at a certain point whether or not there is a

12

resolution of the disagreement and the exception to the

13

no-strike clause which permits the option of going on

14

strike is sufficient to demonstrate that the parties

15

negated judicial enforcement of a contract whether or not

16

the union strikes.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what is your position as to

18

whether or not a lawsuit in a strike could proceed

concurrently?

21

simultaneously?

If there's no final judgment in the

MR. GOLD:

22

Let me treat with the problem, as we

see it, because it explains my answer.

My answer is that

24

we believe that under an agreement of this kind they can

proceed.

7

economic force -- the defendant using economic force.

8
9

First

As that case shows, you can have one

As the Seventh Circuit held in that case,
because of the Norris-LaGuardia Act you can enjoin the

10

nonsuing party from using economic force.

11

that background, well, we don't think that it's hard and

12

f ast.

13

And against

It seems to us it would be unsymmetrical,

14

disproportionate, and unsound to say that the suing party

15

could not use economic force.

16

contract questions and the contract interpretation

17

questions here but you also have the Norris-LaGuardia Act

18

questions, which as the court noted in the Associated

19

General Contractors case, because that case came up

20

twice — first on a status quo injunction pending a

21

determination by the court and a second time around.

22

But you have not only the

So the question of whether the use of force is a

MR. GOLD:

QUESTION:

— judicial --

9

MR. GOLD:

It both eliminates the right for

10

self-help and judicial determination of the meaning of the

11

agreement.

12

in talking about what the policies are here -- the

13

important thing is that it doesn't eliminate the peaceful

14

on the merits determination of what the contract means.

15

It provides an arbitral determination of what the contract

16

means in the traditional sense of determining what a group

17

words that constitute legally enforceable promises mean.

18
19
20

But it doesn't -- and we'll get back to this

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there also a right of

judicial review of the arbitrary -MR. GOLD:

Right, and in addition, it is fairer

21

to save than rather than eliminating judicial enforcement.

22

The Steelworkers Trilogy in such cases set a standard of

23

review of judicial enforcement, but the judicial

24

enforcement is the final step in the process that either

25

party will not accept what the arbitrator has done.

QUESTION:

But the grounds for a court to -- not

to accept the arbitral award are very narrow.

4

MR. GOLD:

Very narrow.

Yes.

Well, that's what

5

I'm saying, but the process is one of enforcement of

6

contracts in the way that any common law lawyer would

7

understand the concept.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, is this case —■ is it very

significant because I would suppose that if the parties

10

are -- do you think the union would ever have agreed to a

11

provision in this particular contract that economic

12

weapons are the only way to resolve an unsettled

13

agreement?

14

MR. GOLD:

No, I think that the greatest reason

15

for doubting the inference that the court of appeals drew

16

is the one you just stated.

17

great deal of concentration here on arbitration and

18

striking, but I think the union certainly presumed that it

19

was not giving away its right to go to court because it is

20

extremely difficult given the disproportion to have 300

21

people lose their sustaining wages —

QUESTION:

I think that there was a

MR. GOLD:

1

Well, I -- I think so and one of

2

the -- one of the important functions this

3

determine — this Court's ruling will have is to give the

4

ground rules against which the parties will negotiate.
QUESTION:

5

The Evans contract in that respect is

6

I guess somewhat better for the employer's position

7

because at page 53 of the Appendix it says, unresolved

8

grievance, except arbitration decisions, shall be handled

9

as is set forth in the no-strike clause.
MR. GOLD:

10

Yeah, and the question there is why

11

are these two contracts which -- which were entered into

12

by the same parties at the same time different?

13

that mean?

14

was litigated on the basis that the agreements were

15

substantially the same.

What did

The court of appeals points out that this case

The employer has never relied on

%

16

that as showing a studied determination to resolve the

17

problem and it does have the phrase unresolved grievances.

18

How you resolve grievances is as — in the final analysis

19

is as silent -- is a question which is as -- totally

20

unaddressed, in the Evans collective bargaining agreement

21

as in the other collective bargaining agreement.

22

Having taken these detours, let me state what we

23

believe the right rule is.

We believe the right rule is

24

that collective bargaining agreements should not be

25

construed to preclude judicial enforcement unless that is

1

clearly and unmistakably the party's intent.

2

We believe that that is the sound rule of law

3

because of — of the language policies and purposes of

4

section 301 which adds a provision making collective

5

bargaining agreements enforceable in court.

6

has explained those purposes and policies —■ most

7

particularly in Lincoln Mills which we set out the basic

8

holding of at pages 10 and 11 of our brief -- as the Court

9

said there, Congress' point was that unions as well as

As this Court

10

employees should be bound to collective bargaining

11

contracts.

12

with a procedure for making such agreements enforceable in

13

the courts by either party.

14

There was also a broader concern, a concern

Congress, having created this system in order to

15

further industrial peace by making these labor contracts

16

enforceable in the Federal courts, creating quite a

17

constitutional ruckus in doing so, as Lincoln Mills

18

indicates, it seems to us that a determination that the

19

parties have contracted out of the usual processes of the

20

law ought to be one that is clear and unmistakable.

21

And we believe for the reasons we also spell out

22

in the brief that section 203(d) which recognizes a

23

preference for final adjustment by a method agreed upon by

24

the parties does not cut back on section 201 at all, that

peaceful methods of settlement of the whole point of both

section 301 and 203(d) and title II more generally was to

the parties negotiate agreements and to encourage and

-

Congress did not prohibit the parties from
saying that they were going to have a system in which the

10

contract is not enforceable in any sense that one would

11

understand the contract being enforceable, namely a

12

contract being a set of promises which attempts to capture

13

the future and where disagreements on meaning are settled

I'm sorry, Justice —

QUESTION:

cases where the contract isn't clear?

not there was just cause for the termination.

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

I mean you're not

Where the parties don't provide

10

for arbitration it is well settled that the Court

11

interprets the contract and Lincoln Mills says that the

12

courts must fashion the law they apply, the contract law

13

they apply from the policy of our national labor laws.

Again, we set out the quote at page 9 —

Well, there would not be a Federal

to the evolving arbitral law on what just cause means,

Yeah, and that Congress made the

a lot of things have changed, but it was a fighting issue

In other words, it was a long time ago and

10

in 1947 as to whether these contracts ought to be

11

judicially enforceable or whether there ought to be a

12

system where there were simply guidelines which the

13

parties in essence could tear up anytime they wished to do

14

so if they felt strongly enough.

15

And let me add in that regard that in no sense

16

does a strike system constitute a method of enforcing a

17

contract.

18

parties can do that as I say, but I don't see how it can

19

be fitted into Congress' determination to have contracts

20

enforceable through the usual processes of the law.

It is a method of creating a new contract.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERENCE V. PAGE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. PAGE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

6

The issue presented in this case is whether once

7

there is in existence a collective bargaining agreement in

8

a dispute resolution process within that agreement and

9

that a grievance is filed and those grievances run the

10

route of the dispute resolution process in the agreement,

11

should the court presume that the end result is final or

12

not final?

13

I agree it is a battle of presumptions.
With respect to the number of contracts in which

14

this language might be found, I can say to the Court that

15

the Bureau of National Affairs contains a database of

16

approximately 400 — I should say approximately 400

17

collective bargaining agreements.

18

agreements call for resolution by some method other than

19

arbitration.

20

QUESTION:

What -- what is the reason that an

21

employer or a union would prefer this kind of a contract

22

to a contract for binding arbitration?

You're telling this agreement says nothing except we agree

that the fact that they choose that kind of method for

compelling negotiation and indeed compelling resolution

3

indicates the importance with which they attach to

resolution of the -- of the grievance in the first place.

5

So I submit that the process — the grievance

process is not just the first four conferences, if you

7

will.

happens is if it isn't resolved in the first four steps

9

and it's thrown over into that article of a contract, what

10

occurs then is that pressures both parties to sit down and

11

resolve the grievance, because, indeed, the union doesn't

12

want to stay on -- stay on strike over agreements and

13

indeed the employer doesn't want to stay inoperable

14

because — so I think that that is -- that that strike

15

lockout step is a continuation of the grievance process

16

which compels a resolution.

17

It includes the strike lockout, because what

They might have struck

opinions, has ratified that the policy is expressed in

2

section 203(d) which states that final adjustment by a

3

method chosen by the parties is declared to be the

4

desirable method by which grievances are settled with

5

respect to the interpretation and collective — and

6

application of the collective bargaining agreement.

7

So if the substantive law is to be developed and

8

consistent with the policy and the policy is final

9

adjustment by a method chosen by the parties and clearly

10

that was the legislative history, this Court's

11

interpretation, the statutory language itself, all speaks

12

to the fact that that is the policy, final adjustment by a

13

method agreed to by the parties.

14

QUESTION:

So is your answer that when an

15

employer and a union enter into a contract, they don't

intend that it shall be or that anyone shall have a right

of judicial enforcement?

MR. PAGE:

Well, yeah, the one contract

indicates that unresolved grievances will be processed

through article 16.

for is that the presumption is finality, because that is

consistent with the policy of the legislation and this

Court has never gone beyond saying which can go to in

8

three instances, repudiation by the employer and for

representation by the union or if the parties indicate a

11

This Court, as its developed the substantive law

of 301 has always said, we are going to use it to make you

13

agree to the process that was arrived at through the

14

collective bargaining process, your industrial

and because the legislation clearly expresses its policy

MR. GOLD:

Just two very brief points if I

could.
First of all, I want to emphasize as Justice
Stevens just indicated that this is a question of
interpretation.
and I quote,

The whole argument on the other side is,

"the parties are committed to the process

they agreed on."

The problem is that it isn't plain what

the parties agreed on and against that background, we're
suggesting what we believe is the better interpretive
rule.
Secondly, the policies of the Labor Management
Relations Act are far more complex than simply that the
parties can do whatever they want.

That was an argument

that the unions made in 1947 and it might have been a
better world if we prevailed, but we did not.

And

Congress provided that one of the policies was stability
during the term of collective bargaining agreements.
Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Gold.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
