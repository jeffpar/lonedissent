QUESTION:

Mr.

Nordyke,

there

a

Louisiana

2

statute, is there not, that deals with forcible medication

3

of prisoners?

4

MR. NORDYKE:

Yes, ma'am, title XV, section 830.1.

5

QUESTION:

Was

6

attention of the trial court?

7

MR. NORDYKE:

that

section

called

to

the

Your Honor, we briefed that section

8

consistently throughout and the only time the trial court

9

used the word was in an August 26th hearing where he ordered

10

forcible medication and he just simply said, in accordance

11

with 830.1, I order the forcible medication.

12

The problem with him simply doing that is that

13

830.1 sets up a whole panoply of due process protections

14

virtually similar to the Harper decision last year.

15
16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well,

do you take the position that

that statute governs in this situation, or should govern?
MR. NORDYKE:

Your Honor, from day 1 in this case

we have taken that precise position.
QUESTION:

Your position being that medication is

20

not permitted under the statute because he's not a danger

21

to himself or others?

22

MR. NORDYKE:

Your Honor, I think there are two

23

prongs to that and it's the same two prongs that Your Honor

24

wrote about in Harper last term.

25

First, we have the best interest component and

1

secondly,

the danger to self and others component.

2

record in our case is absolutely barren of either.

3

is no finding of best interest and no finding of danger to

4

self or others by the trial court.

5

that calls for punishment.

QUESTION:

It's simply an order

And you took this position consistently

throughout all the proceedings to this Court?

8

MR. NORDYKE:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, is it your contention that the

10

Louisiana trial court which authorized the medication is

11

acting in violation of Louisiana law?

12

MR. NORDYKE:

13

QUESTION:

14

Your Honor, it's —

That's not one we would be likely to

entertain.

15

MR. NORDYKE:

problem,

17

Louisiana has set up a statutory scheme in title XV 830.1

18

and title XXVIII, section 59, which is a companion statute

the first brief, but I am almost certain —• I know that we
briefed 830.1.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but that's quite different than

12

briefing the argument that 830.1 creates a liberty interest

13

which would in turn give you a right under the Fourteenth

14

Amendment.

15

Not at this moment, but after the argument?

16

20

Could you supply us with a transcript citation?

MR. NORDYKE:

We will file that with the Court,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And I would like to know if. you -- if

the issue came up before the supreme court.
MR. NORDYKE:

Definitely it came up before the

21

Supreme Court of Louisiana, Your Honor.

22

brief that we filed in this Court is very similar to the

23

brief that we filed in the Louisiana Supreme Court and has

24

virtually all the same arguments, including the due process

25

argument, the State created liberty interest.

11

The second major point that we want to make in

no prison physicians have ordered this.

14

a second ago, Louisiana does have a statute which we claim

4

QUESTION:

You're not making any argument that we

should review this as a decision based on Louisiana law,

6

that the court interpreted the statute incorrectly?

8

MR.

NORDYKE:

Oh,

no,

Your Honor,

not at all.

Not at all.

9

QUESTION:

10

though, is what Louisiana does.

11

Louisiana set up a liberty interest and you claim that the

12

trial court didn't follow it.

13

MR.

Well, the predicate for your argument,

NORDYKE:

Louisiana does — you claim

That's correct,

Your Honor.

But

that's no different than the liberty interest that was set

up in Harper last term or set up in many of the due process
