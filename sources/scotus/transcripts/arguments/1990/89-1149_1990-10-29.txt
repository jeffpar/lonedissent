ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR.

GALLAGHER:

Mr.

Chief

Justice,

and may

it

please the Court:

10

The question presented in this case concerns the

11

appropriate standard of proof which a bankruptcy court must

12

apply when deciding questions of nondischargeability under

13

section

14

preponderance of the evidence standard that is ordinarily

15

applied in civil cases or is it, as the Eighth Circuit held

16

in this case, that the creditor must prove each element of

17

section 523 by clear and convincing evidence.

523(a)(2)

9

an unliquidated tort claim.

10

And the court would adjudicate

the existence of that debt first, and then --

MR. GALLAGHER:

Yeah, well, that's what he posed.

14

QUESTION:

Well, that's what I'm saying.

Upon a preponderance basis?
Well, if that were the State law.

I mean,

15

you would still have claim with the general creditors, even

16

if you had no preferences, right?

17

MR. GALLAGHER:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

So the State would then have to go on.

19

Having decided first that there is no clear and convincing,

20

it would then go on and decide secondly whether there is a

21

fraud

22

wouldn't it?

23

a

preponderance.

MR. GALLAGHER:

It

would

the

claim,

It would decide the claim in the

first instance, and then if the creditor asked, would decide

25

whether it were dischargeable.
