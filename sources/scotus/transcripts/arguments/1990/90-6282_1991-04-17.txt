ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL I. KLEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KLEIN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The statute that we challenge -- the temporary

11
12

scheduling provision of the Controlled Substances Act

13

gives the Attorney General unchecked power to adopt and

14

then to enforce criminal prohibitions against previously

15

lawful behavior.

16

important structural issues concerning Congress' power to

17

delegate criminal rulemaking authority.

18

We think the statute raises two

First, may Congress combined in one government

19

official two core separated functions — the power to

20

create a crime and the power to prosecute individual

21

violators?

And second, may Congress bar judicial review
o

22

of criminal rulemaking determinationseither completely

23

as we’read the statute, or at least until after someone is

24

indicted, as the Government reads the statute?

25

argument is that neither practice -- neither practice,

Our

much less both in the same statute is consistent with a

2

government of properly separated powers.

3

Now, before addressing each of these issues

4

individually, I'd like to emphasize at the outset how

5

unprecedented this statute truly is.

6

has never approved either practice.

7

surprising, because for all intents and purposes Congress

8

has never adopted these kind of practices in any previous

9

statute.

This Court of course
And that's not

So far as we can tell no statute gives the

10

Attorney General or any other official the power to make

11

and enforce a criminal sanction against purely private

12

conduct.

13

The example that the Government gives — the

14

only example I presume that they were able to find — is

15

regulations controlling prison access.

16

that's so entirely distinguishable, because the Government

17

there and the Attorney General is responsible for the

18

operation of that building much as any department would be

19

for the operation of its own buildings.

20

different from purely private conduct.

Now, that crime would

But the President can also tell the Attorney

MR. KLEIN:

Yes, Justice Scalia, but I think —

I think there are two distinctions there.

First of all,

10

in both instances, that is first as you say the President

11

has to tell them — the HHS Secretary — how he wants the

12

crime defined.

13

doesn't have to follow the President.

14

in that respect, of course he's removable by Congress.

So it's the same situation, isn't it?
I don't think so.
I mean it isn't that the Attorney

General both — in fact did the Attorney General

personally do you think define the drug offense or do you

24

think — he delegated that to DEA, didn't he?

He did.

QUESTION:

1

So you had two different Federal

2

officials, one making the determination of what's a crime,

3

and another one, a United States attorney presumably,

4

making the prosecution which is the same thing you have

5

with HHS.

6

MR. KLEIN:

I don't think it is in a structural

7

sense, Justice Scalia.

8

important.

9

were two judgments here.

And I think the distinction is

I understand as the statute worked out there
This statute, however, uniquely

10

I suggest, gives one department both functions.

11

think there were both practical as well as structural

12

considerations when you say HHS passes the statute, and

13

then the Government — the Justice Department — enforces

14

it.

15

Now, I

And let me suggest to you that's not an argument

16

that's unique to me.

17

makes when it says that the Department of — of EPA should

18

not have criminal enforcement powers.

19

Department opposes that same look.

20

separated judgments here.

21

the other is to prosecute the violator.

22

QUESTION:

That's an argument the Government

The Justice

There should be two

One is to define the crime and

You know I expect the Justice

25

the first century of -- of the republic.

So that, you

1

know, the diversity of personnel that you have would be

2

DEA making the -- one decision, the United States attorney

3

making the other, is exactly the diversity you would have

4

had in the entire Federal Government had two different

5

departments done this — the work.

6

MR. KLEIN:

I — with respect, I don't think

7

that's an accurate perception, and let me suggest I think

8

the legislative history suggests otherwise as well.

that is to say I think the Justice Department, at least,

QUESTION:

And I —

What is your constitutional point,

Mr. Klein?

given within the executive branch?

Is it that these two functions cannot both be

16

MR. KLEIN:

17

QUESTION:

Not — not to the same department.
Well, what authority is there for

18

that in our cases to say that there's some sort of

19

internal separation of powers' principle within the

20

executive branch?

21

I never heard of that.

MR. KLEIN:

Well, I think —

which say the same person in the -- in the executive

2

cannot prosecute a parole violation as well as sit on it.

3

That is it separates the adjudicatory and the

4

prosecutorial function.

5
6

QUESTION:

Yes, but we don't have any

adjudicatory function here.

7

MR. KLEIN:

I agree, but, Chief Justice

8

Rehnquist, I think it's fair to say the reason there's no

9

authority — there's no contrary authority either.

10

And

that's because it — Congress has never done this before.

Now, let me suggest to you why I think it's an

12

13

important part of the delegation doctrine.

There's no dispute about that.

2

that's a product of practical necessity.

look, we realize society is too complex and too technical

for Congress to be making every single decision.

In other words,

So it

Now, having done that much as a product of

practical necessity, I don't see why it follows that

eliminated.

QUESTION:

But where in — where in our cases or

in what provision of the Constitution do you find a

13

requirement of two separated judgments like you're talking

about?

that the Attorney General --

QUESTION:

There's no question today

That's true.

of which are criminal.

9

MR. KLEIN:

Absolutely.

And this Court has said

time and again that's a product of practical necessity.

10

We can't expect Congress to do the fine details.

11

does it follow — and the fact that there's no precedent I

12

suggest isn't instructive because the issue is one of

13

first impression -- why would it follow if you need

14

executive expertise to define a standard that therefore

15

you can merge would have to be two classically core-

16

separated functions?

17

But why

I mean, I can't understand — when we start out

18

we have a legislator and an executive.

19

you go back to — to Locke and to Montesquieu and so

20

forth, the basic function in those two different

21

departments is on the one hand, one makes the criminal law

22

and the other enforces it.

MR. KLEIN:

I agree that we normally don't think

5

of it that way, but that's because I don't think this

6

issue, which I think is unique in our history, has been

raised before.

8

example, I wouldn't be here saying, you can give power to

9

OSHA but not to EPA or to any other agency.

I don't think there's any problem.

For

What I'm suggesting is there's an underlying

10
11

core principle which I think we share, and that is

12

criminal laws should be made by Congress or, to the extent

13

that they have to be delegated as a matter of necessity,

14

we should make sure there are two separated judgments.

15

It's not a perfect separation.

QUESTION:

But there aren't separate — you

either have to make it depend upon the executive, in which

I understand he subdelegated it.

We question that, too.

The statute says the Attorney

General, he can make this drug a crime.

QUESTION:

I'm

And the Constitution says that the

7

President can make the drug a crime, because any power

8

that's delegated to the Attorney General belongs to the

The President can tell the Attorney General to

Even if it's given to HHS, you have it

that's happened before where the President has instructed

— somehow no different from having on the one hand Health

By the same token, I could possess this drug.
And that becomes a crime

The second point I want to make is on judicial

In other words, if all that Congress meant to do

that's all that it meant to do, there still could be pre-
