ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DOYLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Batson v.

12

Kentucky applies in civil cases in the United States

13

district courts.

14

you today is whether, in a case in which a black man is a

15

litigant, counsel for his opponent can use his statutorily

16

granted peremptory challenges to remove blacks from the

17

jury panel without any question or without any

18

interference from the court.

19

and we suggest three reasons why such a practice is

20

inconsistent with the dictates of this Court.

21

More specifically, the question before

We contend that he cannot,

22

protection analysis.

conflict among the circuit courts of appeals which now

2

exists.

3

Court of Appeals, in a case called Dunham v. Frank's

4

Nursery and Crafts, which is cited in the reply brief,

5

ruled in a case on all fours with the case before you

6

today that Batson does apply in civil cases.

As recently as last month, the Seventh Circuit

Prior to that ruling, the Eleventh Circuit had

7
8

reached the same result in a case in which certiorari was

9

denied by this Court.

The Eighth Circuit has ruled that

10

with respect to a governmental litigant the. Batson rule

11

does apply and does extend to civil cases.

12

awaits action by this Court on a petition.

That case now

In this particular case, the plaintiff filed

suit as a result of injuries that he sustained while he

15

was working on a United States Army base.

22

at its conclusion, the judge and counsel retired to the

At that point, counsel for the respondent exercised two of

25

his three challenges against black jurors.

MR. DOYLE:

Well, the peremptory challenges were

made known in chambers.

The effect of the challenges,

after the court reconvened.

1

At the point at which the challenges were

2

exercised by the respondent, I did object and cited the

3

court to Batson v. Kentucky and argued that in that

4

particular case, since there was a black litigant and

5

since counsel for the respondent had exercise two of his

6

statutorily granted strikes against members of the black

7

race, that the equal protection basis of Batson was

8

implicated.

9

The judge overruled my objection, refused to

10

allow — or refused to require, rather, the, counsel for

11

the respondent to voice a racially neutral reason for the

12

objections or for the challenges that he had made and the

13

case went back into the courtroom.

14

At that stage, the judge then called the jury

15

back in the box, announced which jurors were being

16

excused.

17

was once again raised to the court in open court, outside

18

the jury's presence.

19

case proceeded to trial.

20

Those jurors left the courtroom.

The objection

It was once again overruled, and the

We believe that Batson made clear — this

21

Court's opinion in Batson made clear that the Constitution

22

prohibits all forms of purposeful racial discrimination in

23

jury selection.

24

in the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, agreed and

25

ruled 2 to 1 for that proposition, extending Batson to

1

this particular civil case.

But on en banc rehearing,

2

that decision was reversed and the court ruled that equal

3

protection was not implicated because of the absence of

4

State action.
We contend that the fundamental error that the

5
6

trial court made and the fundamental error made by the

7

court of appeals sitting en banc was in not recognizing

8

that Batson was — should be extended to civil cases, and

9

in refusing to require the judge to conduct the hearing

10

which Batson would mandate.

The fact that that hearing

11

was not conducted in this case requires a reversal and a

12

remand so that the hearing can be conducted to determine

13

whether the challenges were racially exercised or

14

exercised for some other reason.
The first argument that we will address the

15
16

Court's attention to is the constitutional argument.

17

trial in a Federal courtroom is a public function, whether

18

it's civil or criminal.

parties.

Mr.

Doyle,

I suppose if it's a

constitutional argument you're making, you would apply

equally to state courts?

QUESTION:

Yes,

sir.

So if a State court did its business

in a different way than a Federal court, that wouldn't

QUESTION:

MR. DOYLE:

Um-hum, um-hum.
The first question we submit that

10

should be addressed is whether those who participate in an

11

inherently governmental function, that is, selecting a

12

jury that is going to try and hear a case in a Federal

13

courtroom, engage in governmental action during this

14

process.

distinction that can be drawn between persons who compile

16

and select the names for the jury wheel and the lawyer who

ultimately makes the decision of who he's going to sit on

Why — how do you shift back and

15

making that decision.

I mean, if the lawyer is in effect the Government

That's a Government decision?

He can make that

he's making that as a governmental decision then?
MR. DOYLE:

So it would be okay for him to say,

20

well, in this district I think the jury is likely to be

black and I know we have a white judge on the docket, and

I still don't think at that point it

QUESTION:

MR. DOYLE:

QUESTION:

Mr. Doyle —
Yes?
— in California the — each party is

5

entitled to recuse the judge — you can made that motion

6

only at one point — in the State superior courts.

7

Suppose that a judge was recused because of his or her

8

race?

What result?
MR. DOYLE:

I believe that would have the same

10

effect constitutionally, because it would still be the

11

selection of a governmental official.

12

analysis, I would have to agree that that would be

13

prohibited by the equal protection analysis of the

14

Constitution — if it were made for solely that reason.

So following that

I don't want to get beyond the narrow focus of

15
16

this case.

I'm not suggesting, Justice Kennedy, that

17

there is never a circumstance where a white litigant could

18

not successfully challenge a black juror.

19

he can't challenge him, in this case we offer for your

20

consideration, is for a racial reason.

21

analysis would apply equally to the judge it seems to me.

22

If that right is given to the lawyer in the California

courts, then it would be given in no different fashion

than the passing over to the litigant -- to the lawyers

1

governmental officials in a jury trial.

2

I want to address, if I might just a moment, the

3

questions which are presented by two cases this Court has

4

decided on the issue of State action, Lugar v. Edmonson

5

Oil and Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope.

6

Those cases set forth a two-prong test to determine

7

whether State action exists.

8

for the original panel opinion, believed that that test

9

was met.

Judge Rubin, in analyzing it

The en banc majority's decision that it — that

10

Batson would not be extended — turned on their analysis

11

that the test was not met.

12

that the first prong is clearly here, because the exercise

13

that the peremptory challenge is an exercise made pursuant

14

to a governmental grant of authority.

15

All parties concede, however,

It's the second part of the test which needs to

16

be addressed by this Court in this analysis and was

17

addressed below.

18

actor, the lawyer involved, acted with the significant

19

assistance of public officers and officials.

20

That is whether the otherwise private

of private parties and governmental officials in an equal

bailiff.

Picking a jury then is a series — is not a

2

series of isolated procedures, but it's a continuum, and

3

any stage in the process can lead to a result not allowed

4

by law.
QUESTION:

5

Well, Mr. Doyle, is your

6

identification of the private lawyer as a part of a

7

Government operation consistent with our decision in

8

Dodson against Polk County?
MR. DOYLE:

9

I think it's a different case from

10

Dodson, Mr. Chief Justice, because in the Pplk County v.

11

Dodson case, the only issue reached was whether the public

12

defender acted under color of State law in section 1983.

13

And as Justice White pointed out in the Lugar case, the

14

issues of equal protection were never addressed in Polk

15

County.

16

that —

17

And it did not foreclose the possibility that

QUESTION:

Do you think it's different — that

18

the Government action can be different for one

19

constitutional provision than for another?

20

MR. DOYLE:

No, sir.

I think, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, that the — that whether governmental action is

22

present is different depending upon what the person who is

23

asserted to be a State actor is doing.

24

of the functions that the public defender could have

25

performed in Dodson would be inherently governmental and

I think that some

1

some not.

So I think that's the distinction.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. DOYLE:

Like picking the jury?
Picking the jury if it — if you

4

accept as a hypothetical premise that the Batson equal

5

protection analysis would apply to a public defender in a

6

defense context, and I'm not reaching that point.

7

you do accept that, then certainly, if that public

8

defender engaged in a discriminatory jury strike, she

9

would have been engaging in State action.

10

QUESTION:

But if

Mr. Doyle, under your view, in a

11

private, civil action on behalf of, let's say, a plaintiff

12

who was black, would the plaintiff's exercise of

13

peremptory challenges against white perspective jurors be

14

similarly suspect and open to challenge under the Equal

15

Protection Clause?

16

MR. DOYLE:

Clearly it would under the Equal

17

Protection Clause if that is the limited focus of the

18

analysis.

19

analysis is the broadest sweep of the argument that I'm

20

making, Justice O'Connor.

If another provision — the equal protection

Certainly, they would have been, if

challenge and I would have been required to voice a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. BAKER, JR.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BAKER:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This Court should affirm the en banc decision of

5
6

the Fifth Circuit basically for two reasons.

7

all, there has been no showing of State action in this

8

case which is absolutely essential for any equal

9

protection claim.

First of

And secondly, unless the congressional

10

statute is unconstitutional, it should be given effect as

11

written.

12

Mr. Doyle has raised, but not been able to

13

argue, other issues that are non-constitutional in origin.

14

These issues were not raised in the lower courts, and I

15

suggested before and I think I should emphasize again that

16

the reason these issues are being raised now is because of

17

the difficulty of the hurdle of State action in this case.

18

And while Mr. Doyle has said that he was not raising a

19

cross-section challenge or he was not raising a Seventh

20

Amendment argument, the fact of the matter is that his

21

argument runs together the issues under the Equal

22

Protection Clause and the issues that have been raised

23

previously and rejected by this Court under other

24

amendments to the Constitution.

25

Under State action, few would normally think

1

that the actions of a private attorney in the course of

2

litigation within the courtroom constitutes State action.

3

In this case, however, there has been the development of

4

the argument that the actions of the attorney constitute

5

State action.

6

expansion of State action as a concept, I think is

7

reflected by Mr. Doyle's discussion of jurors as

8

governmental actors.

But the extent to which there is the

There is, as we know, the potential within some

of the State action cases to expand it to the point where

have the invocation, especially in the Eleventh Circuit

2

opinion by Judge Wisdom, which focuses not on the action

focusing on the attorney as the sole point for identifying

11

specifically set out the Jury Selection and Service Act

12

that more specifically tells us how those principles

13

apply.

14

peremptory challenges are open to the possibility of

15

discrimination, and therefore, could have eliminated them.

16

Congress did not do so.

17

It's part of that act, and that act, it seems to me,

18

implements that particular provision, because it provides

19

for the inclusion.

And Congress could have adopted the position that

20

Congress chose to preserve it.

In fact, that act goes far beyond anything this

21

Court had done up until the enactment, because it provided

22

for a much broader pool in the venire than this Court had

23

required.

24

increase the possibility that the attorneys will not be

25

able to distort randomness or the cross-section as much.

By providing randomness in the venire, you

Because prior to the Jury Selection Act of 1968, Federal

2

courts themselves were not a model, even in the venire, of

the kind of cross-section that we have today, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER:

I think if you read it in the

context of its history and the other statutes, Your Honor,

4

I think that that is in fact the case that's always been

interpreted.

would have thought that that applied to the notion of the

peremptory challenges.

I don't think before Batson that anyone

And indeed if you did apply it on a

case-by-case basis, you wouldn't be able to strike rich

people from the jury or — which certainly happens quite

MR. BAKER:

Your Honors, while peremptory

challenges are not constitutionally required, they are a

congressionally created right.

or may not be the best policy, but unless the statute

16

itself is unconstitutional or unless there is a clear case

of State action that involves, therefore, the Equal

Protection Clause, the statute should be implemented as

written.

Congress' judgment, it was the best way for the parties to

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor, again, that was not at
