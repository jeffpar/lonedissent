ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEE:

11

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The principal issue in this case is whether an

14

Indian tribe can sue a State without its consent.

15

Court has upheld unconsented waivers of State sovereign

16

immunity in only two discrete circumstances.

17

either the United States or another State can sue a State,

18

because those suits, this Court has declared, are

19

essential to the plan of the convention.

20

Congress, by statute can abrogate the State sovereign

21

immunity so long as there is a clear textual statement

22

that Congress really intended to do that.

23

This

First,

And second,

The effort to show that suits against States by

24

Indian tribes are either essential to the plan of the

25

convention or that they have been approved by clear

1

textual statement by Congress will not withstand scrutiny.

2

With respect to what is essential to the plan of

3

the convention, quite unlike the United States and the

4

States, neither foreign governments nor Indian tribes

5

figured in the various compromises and other arrangements

6

of which that convention consisted.

7

the convention's plan were, of course, the States

8

themselves.

9

prerogatives that brought into existence the new

11

The major players in

It was their surrender of sovereign

Constitution and the new republic, the United States.
All sides agree that, as stated very well by my

12

opponents, there is not a shred of evidence that the

13

ability of the Indian tribes to sue the States was even

14

remotely in view during that time of the Constitutional

15

Convention.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, you are addressing, of

17

course, the sovereign immunity point.

18

for certiorari was filed it included a third question,

19

asking whether Federal question jurisdiction was —

20

whether it exists, a point that was addressed by Judge

21

Kozinski in his dissent below.

A

tactical judgment was made along the line not to address

it.

3

merits, we agree completely with what Judge Kozinski had

4

to say, that there is no substantial Federal question.

7

We would welcome a victory on either ground.

The only point on which we disagree with Judge
Kozinski is which is the easier ground, on which -QUESTION:

Is injunctive relief sought here?

8

And if so, even if you were right on the Eleventh

9

Amendment point, is there something left?

10

On the

MR. LEE:

We think not.

And the reason is that

11

the only injunctive relief has to do with what has

12

happened, what would happen in the future.

13

course, is governed by a 1985 statute that is passed by

14

the Alaska legislature, and I just can't see any possible

15

way that anyone can take the position that Federal law,

16

Fourteenth Amendment or otherwise, prohibits a State from

17

lengthening the list of possible recipients.

18

realize that that also goes to the very question that

19

you're asking, which is the substantial Federal question.

20

That, of

Now I

The only reason that we feel that the easier,

21

the cleaner, and the better ground for reversal of the

22

Ninth Circuit's judgment is sovereign immunity rather than

23

the substantial Federal question — and both of them of

24

course are jurisdictional — is twofold.

25

that, has to do with the respective burdens that are

The first is

1

imposed by those two doctrines.
On the one hand, under Hagans v. Lavine and Bell

2

3

v. Hood and others, the burden is on us at this stage of

4

the game to show that the Federal question is so

5

attenuated as to be obviously frivolous, whereas the Court

6

has made it quite clear, as I'd like to explain in just a

7

moment, that the burden of establishing that sovereign

8

immunity does not exist is, of course, on the respondents,

9

and that is a similarly heavy one.
The second reason is, pertains really to the

10
11

Court's considerations and ours as well, and that is that

12

if the case is decided on Hagans v. Lavine grounds, that

13

it becomes a rather inconsequential footnote, Hagans v.

14

Lavine, that makes no difference to anyone in this

15

courtroom, whereas the sovereign immunity issue involves a

16

conflict in the circuits.

17

clients very deeply.

18

two major Indian population circuits and that need to be

19

resolved.

It's one that affects my

It — the two circuits involved are

20

So that while a victory on either ground would

21

not be unwelcome, we would urge the Court to concentrate

22

on the court's — on the Ninth Circuit's sovereign

23

immunity error.

give much emphasis to the other point?

2

MR. LEE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LEE:

That is correct.
And I really wonder why.
Coming back to this concession, and I

5

really do regard it as a concession by the respondents,

6

that the Constitution makers simply did not have the

7

Indian tribes in view, that acknowledged fact supports the

8

petitioner and not the respondents.

9

whether a sufficiently compelling case can be made to

The issue here is

10

overcome the sovereign immunity bar, and that burden, as I

11

mentioned just a moment ago, is on the respondents and not

12

on the petitioners.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, can I ask this question?

It

14

goes to that.

Is the sovereign immunity bar that you rely

15

on one that predated the Eleventh Amendment, or is it the

16

Eleventh Amendment?

17

MR. LEE:

18

QUESTION:

Both.
Because if it's the latter, then of

19

course the, the Constitutional Convention business would

20

be irrelevant.

21

MR. LEE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

That is correct.

Yeah.
That is correct.

Probably the best

24

statement of that, incidentally, appears in the brief of

25

the Academy for State and Local Governments that, really,

1

sovereign immunity of both the United States and the

2

states did preexist the Eleventh Amendment.

3

I would just ask in this respect that you

4

consider the anomaly that would result if the Ninth

5

Circuit's judgment remains the law, because it would mean

6

that Indian tribes who were not participants in either the

7

convention nor the Eleventh Amendment proceedings would be

8

able to sue the States, but that States who were

9

participants and who ceded powers were what made the

10

convention possible could not sue tribes.

11

one can say with a straight face that that kind of result

12

was part of the plan of the convention.

13

QUESTION:

And surely no

The States were at least as — at as

14

high a degree of dignity, so to speak, as the Indian

15

tribes?

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

Yes.
Yes, yes.

That's the anomaly, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. LEE:

Well, but all you have to show is —

Oh, much higher.

Of course States can sue each other.
That is correct.

That is correct.

And in that respect they have something to give and

referred to in the Constitution.

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

10

No one disputes that the State of

What is that?
The fact that States can sue each

other.

11

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

That is correct.

12

The argument that the — probably the principal

13

argument on which the Ninth Circuit relies, indeed it's

14

whole opinion rests on the foundation, that the naked

15

Indian Commerce Clause, in the absence of any affirmative

16

congressional enactment, somehow waives the State

17

sovereign immunity.

18

does so along two separate dimensions.

19

That argument proves too much, and it

First, if the unexercised congressional power to

20

regulate commerce with foreign nations, with the various

21

States, with the several States, and among the Indian

22

tribes, waives State sovereign immunity in all suits

23

brought by Indian tribes, then why not also in suits

24

brought by plaintiffs in the other two constitutionally

25

recognized commercial categories, namely —

QUESTION:

1
2

Monaco against Mississippi was

wrongly -MR. LEE:

3

Exactly.

Exactly.

Exactly.

And not

4

only Monaco v. Mississippi, but also State commercial

5

plaintiffs, interstate commercial plaintiffs.

6

if the bare existence of congressional law-making power

7

waives immunity, then why is there not also a waiver in

8

all suits brought against States by plaintiffs in

9

bankruptcy cases, in patent cases, and in admiralty cases?

Similarly,

Second, and even more important, it is now well

10
11

established that Congress will not be assumed to have

12

waived sovereign immunity — waived the State's sovereign

13

immunity unless there is a clear textual statement to that

14

effect.

15

simply has the authority to act but has not done so.

16

makes no sense at all to say that something less than a

17

clear congressional textual statement will not suffice,

18

but that no statement at all will.

Surely the law cannot be otherwise where Congress
It

19

And this brings us to the argument that

20

Congress, by enacting 28 U.S.C. Section 1362, has

21

satisfied the clear statement rule.

22

Circuit agrees with that proposition, and even a casual

23

examination of the statute reveals why.

24

is not a statute that deals in any way with sovereign

25

immunity.

Not even the Ninth

Section 1362 just

It is solely a jurisdictional statute.

It does

1

not even mention States.

2

sovereign immunity.

3

textual, or any other.

4

It does not even mention

There is no statement at all, clear,

The respondents appear to recognize as much, and

5

their strongest argument with respect to 1362 is that the

6

clear statement rule should not apply for any statute that

7

was adopted between 1964, when pardon came down, and about

8

the mid-1980's, when this Court in a series of cases —

9

probably Pennhurst, too, but clearly Atascadero, Welch,

10
11

and Dellmuth — laid down the clear statement rule.
Aside from its inherent illogic, and I submit

12

that it is inherently illogical, that same argument would

13

necessarily apply to a statute that was adopted in 1973,

14

the date of enactment of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation

15

Act, which was at issue in Atascadero, or in 1975, which

16

was the date of the Education of the Handicapped Act,

17

which was the statute involved in Dellmuth.

18

Indeed, the very argument that the respondents

19

make here in that respect, that you ought to have one

20

constitutional rule applicable for one 20-year period and

21

another one for all else in history, was expressly made,

22

addressed, and rejected in this Court's most recent

23

pronouncement in this area, which is Dellmuth v. Muth.

24
25

After first observing the unlikelihood that what
Congress was really doing in the Education of the

(800) FOR DEPO

1

Handicapped Act was just trying to draw coy little hints,

2

and that's the Court's language, about the meaning of the

3

Eleventh Amendment, the Court then goes on to say this.

4

The salient point, in our view, is that it cannot be said

5

with perfect confidence that Congress in fact intended in

6

1975 to abrogate sovereign immunity, and imperfect

7

confidence will not suffice, given the special

8

constitutional concerns in this area.

9

which is a correct statement of the law, applies just as

10

much to a 1966 statute as it does to a 1973 statute, and

11

the respondents' argument here comes 2 years too late.

12

That statement,

We're told, however, that Indian tribes should

13

be able to sue the States because the United States could

14

bring the suit.

15

these suits on the Indians' behalf cuts solidly in favor

16

of sovereign immunity, and not against it.

17

firmest pillars of our Eleventh Amendment, and generally

18

sovereign immunity jurisprudence, is that it is a

19

constitutional right; it will not be lightly abrogated.

20

The right of the United States to bring

One of the

But the Federal Government does have the right

21

to abrogate it, and it can do so in either of two ways.

22

First of all, Congress can abrogate, so long as it passes

23

a statute that clearly says right in the text that

24

Congress intended to do so.

25

Federal Government can abrogate it is by the executive

And the other way that the

branch bringing suit.

2

What these plaintiffs are really asking for is a

3

rule that would set aside sovereign immunity in those

4

cases where the Federal Government has not made, where the

United States has not made the necessary judgment call

intrusion that — by one sovereign of the prerogatives of

reasons that were alluded to just a moment ago by the

Chief Justice, that sovereign immunity applies only to

suits by individuals and not governments, assuming for the

moment that you can -- that these respondents qualify as

the holding in Monaco v. Mississippi, which the

respondents concede.

them to a government so that the government could.

proves too much because that identical circumstance,

assignment of confederate State bonds by their individual

leading case standing for the proposition that a State can

sue another State, namely South Dakota v. North Carolina.

that really matters is what was in the plan of the

either of them are essential to the convention's plan.

5

The States and the Federal Government were

Now, if the Court agrees with our position

6

concerning sovereign immunity, then it need never reach

7

the question that the more I get into it the more I can

8

see that it is complex and difficult and would have far-

9

ranging consequences.

And that is if you assume that

10

there is some entity that is Indian related that can sue a

11

State, how do you determine who those Indian-related

12

entities are?

13

The one thing that is clear is that the Ninth

14

Circuit's rule on this issue just cannot be the law,

15

because what that court has done is to take two other

16

statutes whose coverage and definition include far more

17

than just tribes and whose purposes have nothing to do

18

with either sovereign immunity or Section 1362, and

19

declare that any group of natives covered by either the

20

Indian Reorganization Act or the Alaska Native Claims

21

Settlement Act automatically have all State sovereign

22

immunity defenses waived in their favor in any suit they

23

bring against the State.

would assume, residential neighborhood watch associations

2

composed of native members could sue the State.

3

reason is that the Indian Reorganization Act, which is one

4

of the incorporation by reference statutes that the Ninth

5

Circuit used, extends not just to tribes but also to —

6

and I'm quoting — groups — groups having a common bond

7

of occupation or association or residence.
You're led to the conclusion that Judge

The

Kozinski's footnote on this issue is probably right, that

10

it extends to — that any group of natives that has any

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE A. ASCHENBRENNER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

May it please the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Alaska and amicus States tell us that if tribes

6
7

are permitted to sue the States directly it will upset the

8

constitutional plan, endanger the States' treasuries, and

9

violate the fundamental principle that sovereign States

10

can't be sued without their consent.

11

that there may be many cases pending if this Court should

12

open the floodgates to direct tribal suits.
The facts are otherwise.

13

The States imply

It has been over 14

14

years since this Court decided Moe v. Salish and Kootenai,

15

which the lower courts immediately construed to abrogate

16

the State's sovereign immunity from suit by tribes, and

17

there has been a grand total of nine tribal-State suits

18

filed.

19

damaging to the State treasuries that a single State has

20

bothered to go back to Congress and seek the reversal.

21

Nor can it be accurately stated that permitting direct

22

tribal suits would upset the constitutional balance.

23

And none of those nine have apparently been so

It's not as if the States came here with their

24

historic sovereign immunity fully intact.

25

contrary, they have already surrendered their immunity and

Thus

10

the question for — before this Court is whether

permitting tribes to bring the same identical suits which

the States have already consented to be sued on would

upset the constitutional balance.

the answer is no.

You say that it makes no difference

who the plaintiff in those suits is, whether it's the

17

United States or some group of Indians?

18

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

That is correct.

It would

19

not upset the constitutional balance for the following

20

reasons.

21

tribal claims inherently in the constitutional plan.

22

U.S. v. Texas and South Dakota v. North Carolina this

resolution of Federal-State and State-State suits was

25

essential to the peace and permanence of the Nation.

In

At

1

the time the Constitution was adopted the threat of Indian

wars was far more eminent and critical than wars between

16

If, therefore, a Federal forum was so essential

17

to keep the peace of the Nation in the case of U.S.-State

18

and State-State suits, far more so was such a forum

19

necessary to keep the peace in tribal-state disputes.

QUESTION:

I don't think they really expected

the Creeks and the Choctaws to hire a lawyer, do you?
MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

I think they did, Your

Honor, for this reason, and I cite Justice Stevens'

24

dissent in Oneida v. Oneida, where they quoted George

Washington's speech to the Senecas.

Washington, recall, was the president of the

2

constitutional convention, the lead framer, if you will.

3

And when in 1790, just 1 year after the Constitution was

4

adopted, he gave a speech to Corn Planter, Chief of the

5

Senecas, he said if your rights have been violated under

6

the Indian Non-Intercourse Act either by individuals or

7

States, he said,

"the Federal courts will be open to you."

But even assuming for a moment that Marshall was

8
9

right and that most of the framers didn't have the tribes

10

in view when they drafted Article III, the jurisdictional

11

provision, that just begs the question.

12

— this Court has many, there are many questions which the

13

framers didn't contemplate which this Court has

14

nonetheless been compelled to answer.

15

is not what the framers actually had in mind, but whether

16

a Federal court forum to resolve these kind of

17

controversies was essential to the plan of the convention.

So that —

The question is

If a Federal forum was

20

essential to the plan of the convention, it didn't prove

to be essential in the first 200 years, I take it, since

this really is the first of these cases that has been

23

brought to this Court, isn't it?

States disputes was not essential to the constitutional

before you first decided that one.

Maybe we should recognize one set

each 100 years.

7

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

(Laughter.)

9

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

This is the year.

The more precise question

10

then again before this Court is whether a Federal court

11

jurisdiction over direct tribal suits is likewise

12

essential to the constitutional plan, not just suits by

13

the United States on Indian claims.

14

depends on whether all tribal-State controversies would be

15

subject to resolution if only the Government could bring

16

the claims, and that this Court has answered no.

17

v. Salish and Kootenai and Arizona v. San Carlos Apache

18

this Court found that the Government is not infrequently

— has a conflict of interest which precludes it from

to sue.

This — this Court's case in Arizona v.
California supports the conclusion that Federal court

jurisdiction is not strictly limited to -- Indian claims

11

brought by the United States.

12

13

that the Government had filed, over the objections of the

the Federal claims.

Now, if Federal court jurisdiction is strictly

the tribes developed along different lines.

The sovereign

2

immunity of the States has been justified almost solely on

3

the ground of protecting the State treasury.

4

immunity of the tribes, on the other hand, has been based

5

on that, but also on the Federal policy embodied in

6

numerous laws to further tribal self-government and

protect economic self-sufficiency of the tribes.

Congress has codified the tribes' sovereign immunity, and

therefore only Congress can abrogate it.

Thus the

This Court's rationale in the leading tribal

argument that they should be allowed — able to rely on

6

the good judgment of the Government in determining what

7

tribal claims should be brought.

8

that argument, I submit, is that the Federal Government

9

would be less zealous in pursuing tribal claims than the

tribes would be on their own behalf, and therefore there

11

would be greater potential liability of the State

treasury.

In order — well, would it be a

Federal — a breach of Federal law if a tribe somewhere,

10

say in Alaska, said we're very poor, we're losing our

11

culture, and we really need lots of money to restore it.

12

Would that be a cause of action against the United States?
MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

No.

Certainly not, Your Honor.

It has to be something a good deal

more tangible than that, doesn't it?

17

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

I agree.

No question.

18

In short what we're saying, that direct tribal

19

suits would not upset the Federal constitutional balance

because the States would not be subjected to a single

Indian claim which they could otherwise claim immunity

1

To finish up on the automatic self-executing

2

claim that Alaska makes for our argument, we'd say on the

3

other hand there isn't anything in the constitutional

4

structure which dictates that private suits against States

5

are necessary to keep the peace, and therefore Congress

6

has to pass a law abrogating the States' sovereign

immunity.

Now Monaco.

The State says that Monaco v.

Mississippi bars tribal suits, but the Court's rationale

10

for barring suits by foreign countries simply doesn't

11

apply to governments within the constitutional structure.

12

Suits by foreign nations, the Court said, could involve

13

international law questions and foreign relations, whereas

14

tribal-State suits and State-State suits could not involve

15

international relations, because both the States and the

16

tribes were divested of their foreign relations authority,

17

the States by delegating it to the United States, the

18

tribes by — as a result of their dependent status.

19

In fact in Hans v. Louisiana this Court held

20

that Federal court jurisdiction over State-State disputes

21

was, quote,

22

diplomatic relations between the States.

rationale applies to tribal-State disputes, because their

diplomatic relations were extinguished in the

Constitution.

have had because in none of them had this Court previously

Moreover, reinterpretation of 1362 is

particularly unjustified here, where Congress has had 14

years to reverse the Court's construction of Moe and

10

hasn't seen fit to do it.
Finally, under the contemporary legal context

doctrine the Court will engage in the presumption that

Congress knows the law, is familiar with this Court's

precedents, and will draft its legislation to conform with

the rules of construction this Court has laid down.

1966, when 1362 was passed, the rule of construction for

This Court discussed the contemporary legal

context doctrine in Dellmuth and implicitly approved of it

while rejecting it, because the statute in question in

Dellmuth was passed in 1975, whereas only 2 years earlier

you had — you had come down with Employees v. Public

Court said that the clear statement rule applied because

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEE:

10
11

I'll only use one of them for just two

brief points, Mr. Chief Justice.
I find nothing less than extraordinary the

12

13

proposition that suits by tribes against States were built

14

into the convention's plan.

15

thinking about this particular issue at the time of the

16

convention, and it just isn't enough under this Court's

17

well-established jurisprudence to say that such a core

18

governmental right will be set aside in any case where it

19

can't be shown that someone at the convention didn't stand

20

up and say, look, affirmatively, we're going to say that

tribes can't sue.

1362 can't pass muster under the clear statement rule.

2

But neither Mr. Aschenbrenner nor anybody else has been

3

able to come up with an answer to the obvious point that

4

if his new rule were the law — that is, one

constitutional standard for one 20-year period and other

constitutional standard for any other period — it would

have equally precluded the result in both Atascadero and
