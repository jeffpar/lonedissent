ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLDBERGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDBERGER:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case involves the interplay between two

12

13

lines of Federal criminal statutes enacted over the past 6

14

years.

15

group of laws reflects the desire of Congress to toughen

16

drug penalties.

18

before November 1987.

all of the statutes involved here, which were certainly

20

meant to work together, to be reconciled.

One line involves sentencing reform; the other

In 1984, after lengthy and thorough

22

deliberation, Congress enacted an scheme of Federal

special form of extended parole applicable only to certain

controlled substances cases called special parole, which

2

was — in 1984, the Sentencing Reform Act instead created

3

a new kind of post-incarceration supervision, to be called

4

supervised release, which was carefully defined and

5

circumscribed in detailed provisions of that 1984 statute.
Congress realized at that time that to prepare

6

7

the Federal criminal justice system to make the change to

8

this entirely new sentencing system would take time, and

9

that 1984 statute thus initially set a start-up period of

10

2 years, in fact over 2 years, for the new system before

11

it would become effective.

12

would -- that 2 years would not be long enough and

13

extended that period for another year, with the resulting

14

effective date for supervised release and all other new

15

aspects of the sentencing system of November 1, 1987.

16

Congress soon realized that it

Meanwhile, on October 27th, 1986, the President

17

signed into law the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which

18

made a number of changes in Federal drug sentencing,

19

especially in the higher-volume offenses.

20

statute used the term, supervised release, without giving

21

any definition for that term.

including section 1002 of that statute which is the

23

statute involved in this case under which my client was

sentenced.

occurred in February 1987, which was of course after

2

enactment of that '86 drug act on October 27th of '86 but

3

before the effective date of the Sentencing Reform Act on

November 1,

'87.

Under the law — one more piece of background

6

that's needed — under the law as existed from 1984 until

7

the effective date of supervised release under the '86

8

Anti-Drug Act, persons convicted of the same offenses as

9

the petitioner here would have been subject to ordinary

10

parole but no other supplemental post-confinement

11

supervision or monitoring.

12

petitioner has an aggregate sentence of 20 years, of which

13

he is likely to serve about 10 in prison and then to serve

14

the remaining 10 years on parole, ordinary pre-sentencing

15

reform act parole.

16

would be in addition to the petitioner's ordinary parole.

QUESTION:

For example, in this case, the

If supervised release applies, this

And, of course, since he serves 10

18

years minimum, at the time that he is released all of the

19

supervised-release provisions that Congress enacted in '84

20

and in '86 will be in effect.

21

MR. GOLDBERGER:

22

QUESTION:

In one sense --

At the time that it is necessary to

23

implement this scene, the statute will be fully effective

24

by its own terms.

MR. GOLDBERGER:

In one sense, Justice Kennedy,

1

that's true, but in another it's not.

And that's because

2

Congress provided in the effective date provisions of the

3

'84 act which govern and control and include the

4

supervised-release implementation and definitional

5

provisions that not only would it have an effective date

6

of November 1, 1987, but also that it should not apply to

7

any offense committed before that date.

8

language of the statute is shall only apply to offenses

9

committed after the taking effect of the statute, so that

I think the

10

section 35.83, which is the supervised release provision

11

of the Sentencing Reform Act by its -- by the terms of its

12

own effective date provision, can never apply to my

13

client's case or to the other people who committed

14

offenses between October '86 and November 1,

15

was Congress' specific declaration on that subject.

16

'87.

That

So the suggestion that the case is not

17

significant because, after all, by the time he finishes

18

serving the 10 year imprisonment portion of his sentence

19

we'll have a system in place.

20

- system in place, but it won't be a system that applies

21

to him by law.

22

QUESTION:

It's true there will be a -

Well, it, it goes to the point of

23

what Congress probably intended, and if you're saying that

24

we can't know what supervised release means because it's

25

an empty term without implementing provisions, there are

couple answers.

2

are on the books.

3

that the implementing provisions won't be needed so far as

4

effecting the supervised release until they are fully

5

effective.

6

One is that the implementing provisions
They're not enforced yet.

MR. GOLDBERGER:

The other is

Well, not only are they not

7

applicable, and of course when we look for congressional

8

intent, the first thing to look at is the language that

9

specifically addresses the question.

The language which

10

addresses that question is language which says that those

11

implementing provisions do not apply to an offense

12

committed at the time my client committed his offenses.

13

But there's another —

14

QUESTION:

Wasn't this just a mistake, as

15

indicated by a later amendment that sought to plug the

16

hole?

17

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Well, there have been

18

contentions in this case that several aspects of what are

19

involved here have been mistakes.

knew at the moment that the vote was taken on the

member of Congress that had fully thought through all of

15

the language doesn't answer it, then to any number of

16 '

other provisions.

17

I don't think there was a member of Congress that

But that's not where we look to — for the meaning
We have rules to apply for this sort of

enactment, and section 1002 doesn't contain the language

you point to.

MR. GOLDBERGER:

If that -- the require -- the

Well, why don't we apply the axiom of

MR. GOLDBERGER:

Because there is such a wealth

of other reasons not to.

overcome that axiom, but I would suggest that we prevent -

basically into three categories.

12

'

QUESTION:

First, that to put 1002 and especially its

13

supervised-release provisions into effect immediately, is

14

to create a set of some half-dozen inconsistencies,

15

contradictions, and complete nullifications of related

16

provisions of the statute that are not there if you —

17

treat the statute as effective on November 1,

18

'87.

The second areas of analysis that overcomes the,

19

the presumptive axiom is the in pari materia approach,

20

which says that we have to view the supervised-release

21

phrase, otherwise undefined in 1002, in relation to all

22

the other provisions dealing with supervised release, and

23

all of them go into effect November 1, 1987.

Mr. Goldberger, are you suggesting in

response to Justice O'Connor's question that there are

some things we call rules of statutory construction, other

things we call axioms of statutory construction — that

10

the two are different?

11

MR. GOLDBERGER:

No, I don't think so.

12

perhaps the — to read the language and attempt to apply

13

it as written, that's a rule.

14

think it's fair — other than that and things of that

category, I think it's fair to say that the rest of these

2

the Government concedes this, that if we do not adopt the

3

November 1, 1987 effective date, which may have been

4

gotten to originally inadvertently but which we now — is

5

the resolution of the problem that works.

that works eliminates the problem of having several other

statutory provisions, drug sentencing provisions, make

cross references that don't exist.

approach as to the future?

2

that would happen further down the line?

3

MR. GOLDBERGER:

What would — inconsistencies

No.

Perhaps I'm remembering a

4

different part of the opinion but I think what he was

5

saying there, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the failure to

6

have a uniform answer to this problem in all the circuits

7

would create inconsistencies and problems down the line.

8

But I don't think he suggested that having one clear

9

answer either way would create problems and

10
11

inconsistencies.
And I would suggest that more problems and

12

inconsistencies down the line are created by perpetuating

13

parole and special parole for an additional year.

14

indeed in the case of -- as the Government seems to argue

15

in its brief at one point and as some of the circuits have

16

-- have held to reintroduce it where it had not existed

17

for 2 years earlier, would create far more problems down

18

the line by having a parole system which there was no

19

agency to administer.

20

I understand that just this weekend as Congress

21

was wrapping up its business in the Judicial Improvements

22

Act it may have extended the life of the parole commission

23

by another 5 years.

24

I hear is right that if, if it has been extended from 1992

with people on parole rather than simply waiting a year

where supervised release applies, that we have a system to

understand it and a system to administer it.

7

In fact, there was a — an additional part of

8

the answer I wanted to give to Justice Kennedy's question,

9

if I could, and that was -- that is that the Sentencing

10

Reform Act provides, in that section which describes

11

supervised release, that important judgments about

12

supervised release are to be made by the sentencing judge

13

at the time of sentencing.

14

most — this is one of the critical ways in which

15

supervised release is fundamentally different from parole

16

is that it's to be decided on its length, its conditions,

I think that we have an

5

The pari materia argument tells us that when a

6

term is used in a statute that — where no definition is

7

given and that definition clearly refers to another

8

statute where that term was invented, the Sentencing

Reform Act invented the concept of supervised release.

10

It's not a term that criminal lawyers had a knowledge of

11

before -- that you have to look to that other statute and

12

bring it in.

And then when that other statute —

MR. GOLDBERGER:
Scalia.

That's exactly right, Justice

That's section 3583 --

6

QUESTION:

So you wouldn't even know — you

7

wouldn't even know how to handle supervised release

8

without consulting a portion of the statute that's not yet

9

in effect?

10

MR. GOLDBERGER:

That's right.

The Government's

11

position is that courts could and no doubt did look to the

12

statute, which as I mentioned at the outset had been

13

enacted in 1984 and was there waiting to go into effect.

14

But my response to that is that the statute not only by

15

its terms wasn't effective but was inapplicable.

Are there any cases where in the

interpretation of statute we use the doctrine of

incorporation of reference that we do in wills, say?

1

I suppose that's pari materia

of a sort.

concept different from that, that when Congress uses a

4

term that has a meaning, has a definition and a meaning,

5

it's — it's — must be understood to be incorporating

that definition and meaning.

7

I'm not familiar with any other -- any other

But in this case -- and I don't mean that we

8

have to blind ourselves to the existence on the books of

9

this as yet ineffective statute.

What I mean is we do

10

look to 3583 and we look to it and we find that Congress

11

has told us not to use it.

12

that we can't have the law, the '86 supervised-release

13

provisions, at least going into effect before that other

14

statute is available for the purpose of making reference

15

to it.

16

And therefore, what we find is

As a final aid to statutory construction in the

supervision, without a clear indication that intended to
do so when there's another plausible interpretation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goldberger --

QUESTION:

Do our cases extend the rule of

lenity to the extent of punishment as well as to the
denomination of the substantive offense?
MR. GOLDBERGER:

Oh, yes, quite clearly so,

Bifulco being the most important case and in many ways the
most similar to this one.

There's a case in which the

court was dealing with the antecedent of supervised
release, that is special parole.

An ambiguity by virtue

of silence was found, and the court, after careful
analysis of the statutory language, cross references, and
purpose, finally turned also to the rule of lenity and —
QUESTION:

But didn't the statutes presume to

set a date and say that this shall take effect on October
the 27th?
MR. GOLDBERGER:
that kind in the '86 act.

No, there is no provision of
There is only — there are

other -- perhaps what you're thinking of is that there are
other effective dates stated later than October '86 for
certain specified provisions of the '86 act and silence
with respect to this provision and that then -- many but a

Well, that does more than invoke that

7

MR. GOLDBERGER:

QUESTION:

9

Yes, that's right.

By specifically specifying a date in

some instances, you assume that where they don't specify

10

it, the ordinary rule of today applies.

11

probably the hardest indication against your position,

12

isn't it?

13

MR. GOLDBERGER:

That -- that's

Well, I — it's — it's an

14

important argument that the other side has and it would be

surprising to me though if there were a difficult problem

enacted saying special parole rather than supervised

2

release, I think expessio unius would have won the day if

3

someone had tried to make, in that situation, the argument

4

that I'm making.

5

It was by virtue of the substitution of

6

terminology to supervised release to a term which -- which

7

necessarily makes reference to another statute and which

8

is meaningless without that other statute, which would in

9

effect be telling a judge, you may impose a sentence —

10

you shall impose a sentence of something called supervised

11

release but — of which we will not tell you the meaning.

12

You can impose a sentence of your own design in this case.

13

I think that's very problematic.

15

QUESTION:

Let me just -- may I ask you one

question to make sure I've got this sorted out?

16

MR. GOLDBERGER:

17

QUESTION:

Of course.

I mean I don't begin to have it

18

sorted out, but the thrust in your argument is always

19

focusing on supervised release.

20

are you also arguing that section 1002 and section 1003

21

simply did not go into effect at all until November 1st?

22

MR. GOLDBERGER:

(Inaudible) axiom as suggested by

MS. WAX:

Well, I don't want to get into a

6

semantical battle, but what we mean by this perhaps is

7

best explicated by what Chief Justice Rehnquist said in

8

Albernez v. United States about the Blockberger Rule.

9

Silence on the Blockberger question and on the question of

10

an effective date does not give rise to the kind of

11

ambiguity that would license a broad-ranging foray into

12

the statute looking for hints and clues that something

13

else was intended, and it doesn't give rise to an occasion

14

for application of the rule of lenity.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Have we applied the rule of lenity to

an effective date issue?
MS. WAX:

Never, Your Honor.

There has never

18

been a case in this Court in which the Court has held

19

that, with silence on an effective date, a delayed

20

effective date was intended and in our — to our knowledge

21

there's never been a court -- a case in the court of

22

appeals, and that should tell us something.

23

Congress relies on this rule.

When it enacts a

24

statute it knows that putting in an express provision that

the effective date is immediate is superfluous and

therefore it doesn't have to do that.

2

this axiom would invite statutory chaos because it would

3

mean that every time Congress didn't stipulate an

4

effective date we'd be free to go into a statute and look

5

for little anomalies, little problems from which we might

6

infer a contrary intent.

7

QUESTION:

And to question

This isn't a little anomaly.

8

the fact that you don't know what this term of art means.

9

It's a brand-new word that is utterly meaningless to

10

anybody unless you consult another statute that isn't in

11

effect yet.

12

MS. WAX:

That is correct.

The statute that

13

describes what supervised release is, it gives it content,

14

that gives content to the word is not in effect during the

15

pertinent period because under the '84 sentencing act it

16

was given in effective date.

17

is not an obstacle to applying the plain terms of the

18

revised penalty provisions, section 841, which clearly

19

state that supervised release is the appropriate penalty.

20

Because the fact is that 3583 which describes what

21

supervised release means does exist.

22

It's on the books, albeit it doesn't have the force of law

23

and perhaps a judge couldn't be held to the letter of it.

1

First of all, the thesis that the whole of

2

section 1002 was delayed for a year is a non-starter,

3

because in the penalty provisions in 1986 Congress

4

stipulated that there would be no parole under these

5

penalty provisions.

6

there simply would be no reason for Congress to state that

7

there's no parole if the effective was November 1st, 1987,

8

because as of November 1st, 1987, parole was abolished.

there was a delayed effective date for the whole of 1002.

We're really making an argument about what Congress wanted
-- what Congress meant to have happen when it passed this
statute.
QUESTION:
to delay it.

Well, they're not saying they wanted

They're saying that they had previously

delayed supervisory release in the earlier statute and all
they've done is said that this statute shall take effect
at the same time as other supervised-release provisions
take — I don't see the inconsistency in it.

Surely they

could have drafted it better, but —
MS. WAX:

Well, the other reason why we think

that the way to solve whatever anomalies there are is not
to delay supervised release is that Congress clearly
passed a provision that had mandatory monitoring in it,
and we have to go a little bit into the history of this
enactment in order to understand why that's important.
Every -- the petitioner and we both agree that
up until the penultimate moment when the 1986 act was
passed, the statute provided for mandatory monitoring in
the form of special parole for all of the drug categories
that apply to petitioner's offense.

So it was crystal

clear that Congress wanted these individuals to get a
mandatory term of monitoring.
The statute also provided that on November 1st,
1987 there was going to be a word substitution.

Every

1

place that special parole appeared in the statute,

2

supervised released would now appear and so people

3

committing offenses after November 1st, 1987, would get

4

supervised release.

5

draft statute, the penultimate statute, create a gap

6

whereby there would be a period that individuals

7

committing these drug offenses would get nothing.

8
9

But it -- but in no way did that

On the eve of enactment for reasons that we will
never know, a substitution was made, a single-word

10

substitution.

11

appeared in the act, the word supervised released -- it

12

was cross out and the word supervised release replaced it.

13

The effect of that word substitution was simply to roll

14

back 1 year the seamless transition from one kind of

15

monitoring to another.

16

perverse to say that what Congress was doing when it

17

substituted those words was opening up a year gap and

sending the message that it wanted to delay the effective

date of this statute either in whole or in part.

account of what happened when Congress passed this

there was no reason to perpetuate what was soon to be an

outmoded form of monitoring.

that Congress forgot to do a few little things over here

doesn't mean that what they did in the core penalty

result in some inconsistencies.

Congress intended to delay the effective date or that this

date of the statute.

in all the places where the replacement was made, this

would be a completely internally consistent and coherent

2

rewrite the statute and put special parole back where

3

supervised release is, which by the way is very different

4

from saying that the effective date of the whole or part

5

of the statute is delayed, which has very different

6

consequences in particular that petitioner won't get any

7

monitoring.

But why not just substitute terms?

8

9
10

That would be the consequence of delaying it.
Well, we

think that the reason not to do that is that the statute
says supervised release and not special parole.
QUESTION:

11

And —

Why couldn't I say that term has no

12

meaning until the other statute takes effect, and since it

13

doesn't have any meaning I'll assume it seems -- it means

14

the same thing as parole, special parole?
MS. WAX:

Well, Your Honor, once again while

it's true that the definitional provision that gives

change from special parole to the new terminology.

can out of a statute that it's — it's a, you know,

Chinese puzzle.

We're trying to fit it together.

And a very sensible way to fit it all together

11
12

that doesn't produce any inconsistencies anyway is to, as

we've sometimes done, not deem the effective to be

immediate.

Your Honor, we think not, because of

18

what Congress did when it passed the statute.

It passed a

19

statute that in all its incarnations, in all its versions

20

provided for a mandatory term of post-confinement

21

monitoring of some form.

22

this statute that didn't provide for mandatory monitoring.

23

The statute was designed to up the penalties that had

24

existed, to plug gaps that were perceived in the previous

25

law, to compensate for the inadequacies of previous law.

There was never a version of

And it just -- it just doesn't make sense to say that

having gone to all of this trouble they really meant to

3

let whole -- all or part of this statute lie fallow for a

4

year.

5

delaying the effective date, especially since, as you

6

suggest, another way to solve the problem which is equally

7

good and avoids the problems I've just talked about is

8

just to scratch out the change and put another word in its

9

place.

10
11

It's simply perverse to solve the problem by

But, you know, both are equally intrusive.

Both

are equally activist.
And it's our view that the least -- the solution

12

that does the least violence to what Congress wrote and

13

what it did is simply to allow judges to turn to the

14

appropriate page in the United States code and read off

15

the penalty and pass sentence using that penalty.

16

really is no practical or legal obstacle to doing that.

17

This is not a case where a judge sits down and is

18

completely stymied by what he sees in front of him.

once again, judges have been doing it.

MS. WAX:

Well, petitioner's correct that the

Yes.

15

If it's — right, if it's good time.

I see.
Yeah.

So it will be at least 10 years

before he'll actually be out and be supervised.
My final — the point — one more point I want

17

to make about this question of delaying the supervised

18

release penalty, which of course would mean that

19

petitioner would get nothing.

20

the conflict in the courts below has not really been about

21

whether individuals who are — to commit their offenses

22

during this period get nothing or get supervised release.

23

Almost virtually every court that's wrestled with this

24

problem has ruled that -- or the result of every decision

25

has been that these offenders get something, either

3

courts below have come out in different ways and they've

4

said different things and some have concluded that the '86

5

act is delayed and some have concluded that they're not,

6

there's virtually unanimous agreement that it simply would

7

not comport with what Congress did when it passed this act

8

and what Congress intended to open up, to create this

9

opening for individuals committing these offenses.

10

But petitioner is
And although the

The second point about delaying supervised

11

release is that it really can't be squared with the text

12

and structure of the 841 penalty revisions.

13

actually look at section 1002 and the changes that it made

14

to section 841 to the penalties, you'll see that the terms

15

of imprisonment, the fines, and the post-confinement

together in one paragraph.
