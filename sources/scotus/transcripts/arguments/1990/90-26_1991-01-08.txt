ORAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE E. UHL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. UHL:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

In Indiana under Indiana code, Section 35-45-4-

11

1, a person cannot leave his home naked and walk down the

12

street.

13

without —

He cannot give a political speech in a park

14

QUESTION:

Without being in trouble.

15

MR. UHL:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. UHL:

That's correct.

He would get in trouble, Your Honor,

18

if he walked into a public place such as a bar or a

19

bookstore without his clothes on.

20

could not walk naked up and down the aisles in the bar,

21

nor could he sit down at a table without his clothes on,

22

nor could he stand up on the bar or on a stage at the

23

front of that public establishment without his clothes on.

24
25

QUESTION:

Once inside the bar, he

He can evidently sing in an opera

without his clothes one.

MR. UHL:

1

Well, our point, Your Honor, is that

2

the plaintiffs say that if he starts dancing when he gets

3

up on that stage or up on that bar, then he can do

4

anything — or anything that can be defined as dancing —

5

then he's privileged under the First Amendment to appear

6

naked, notwithstanding Indiana's public indecency statute.

7

QUESTION:

What about seeing an opera?

Am I

8

correct in my understanding of what Indiana law is?

9

there is an exception to the nudity law somehow for

10

That

artistic performances, is that right?
MR. UHL:

11

The Indiana Supreme Court, in order to

12

avoid an overbreadth challenge, has held that the statute

13

does not affect activity which cannot be restricted by the

14

First Amendment.

15

case was "a larger form of expression."

16
17

And the term that the court used in that

QUESTION:

MR. UHL:

19

QUESTION:

21

Which includes opera but not go-go

dancing?

18

20

So —

That's correct, Your Honor.
Is there — where does that come

from?
MR. UHL:

Your Honor, the court looked at cases

22

such as Southeastern Promotions where this Court in

23

implied that the production of Hair, for example, needed

24

to include nudity.

25

cases, presumed that the First Amendment —

And I think, drawing from that line of

QUESTION:

1

It is the good-taste clause of the

2

Constitution?

How does one draw that line between Salome

3

and the Kitty Cat Lounge?
MR. UHL:

4

I don't —

The line is drawn the same way the

5

line is drawn anytime conduct is involved, and that is

6

whether or not the conduct communicates.

7

communicates, then the conduct is speech.

8

does not communicate, then the conduct is not speech.
QUESTION:

9

MR. UHL:

10

11

If the conduct

An idea?

Communicates a particularized message

or an idea.
QUESTION:

12

13

Communicates what?

If the conduct

What about a particularized message

and an idea of sensuality?

14

MR. UHL:

That could be communicated.

However,

15

the plaintiffs in this case did not establish — did not

16

carry their burden of proving that that was the

17

particularized message that they were sending by their

18

dancing.
QUESTION:

19
20
21
22

Because they were not good enough

dancers?
MR. UHL:

No, it didn't have anything to do with

the quality of the dance, Your Honor.

It had to do with

23
24

QUESTION:

25

MR. UHL:

Well, could a dance communicate that?
Yes, a dance could communicate that.

MR. UHL:

But this one didn't?
These dances did not.
Because they were not good enough

dancers?
MR. UHL:

No, Your Honor, it wasn't the quality

6

of the dancing.

7

either instance it's speech.

11

Go-go dancing can be good or bad, but it

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Uhl, are you conceding that

if conduct does communicate, then it can't be regulated at
all under the First Amendment?
MR. UHL:

No, Your Honor, our second issue in

12

the case is that even if this dance is speech, then it can

13

be restricted under the First Amendment.

14

we've drawn on two lines of cases for that argument.

15

And basically

First, we've argued that our statute is a

16

general criminal prohibition on public nudity that applies

17

— that is no directed at speech and is content neutral in

18

the sense that it is irrelevant what message might be sent

19

by the conduct.

20

of Employment Division v. Smith which involved drug use,

21

this Court held that a general criminal prohibition such

22

as that would be valid even as applied to native Americans

23

who claimed that their use of peyote was a religious

24

practice protected by the First Amendment.

25

Under the case — under last term's case

QUESTION:

But in light of the Baysinger and

1

other decisions of your State's courts it does seem that

2

what's left is not content neutral in all respects.
MR. UHL:

3

Your Honor, I think the respondents

4

have over construed Baysinger when they say that Baysinger

5

created some kind of a speech exception.

6

QUESTION:

Well, but you said today that Indiana

7

has held that the statute doesn't apply to certain

8

performances.
MR. UHL:

9
10

Indiana's held that only if that is

required by the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

11

Well, that seems to be the position

12

that the court has taken, and in light of that, how can

13

you take the position here that the statute is content

14

neutral?

15

MR. UHL:

The Indiana Supreme Court did not

16

consider the possibility that this statute might be a

17

reasonable restriction on speech.

18

raised in the case — in the Indiana Supreme Court case.

19

So basically Baysinger is nothing more than a tautology.

20

Baysinger simply said that the public nudity statute can

21

prohibit public nudity to the extent allowed by the First

22

Amendment.

23

regulability cases, Employment Division v. Smith or the

24

other line of cases, the reasonable time, place, and

25

manner cases, that this activity can be restricted

That question was not

Our argument here is that under this Court's

1

consistent with the First Amendment.

2

does not — the Baysinger decision does not stop this

3

Court from holding that that is true under the First

4

Amendment.
QUESTION:

5

Suppose the dancers complied with the

6

statute, and —

7

protected by the First Amendment?

9

would you say that then the dancing is

MR. UHL:

8

And therefore, it

Well, our second argument assumes that

the dancing is speech.
QUESTION:

10

No, no.

If they complied with the

11

statute and still danced, they would not be dancing nude.

12

In that event, would the dancing be protected?

13

suppose you would say no.

14

MR. UHL:

I would

The protection of the dance doesn't

15

depend on whether or not the clothing is worn for the

16

purposes of our second argument.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. UHL:

How about the first argument?
Well, the clothing doesn't change the

19

nature of the dance either.

20

doesn't make the dance speech and doesn't protect it as

21

speech.

22

That's correct.

The clothing

The dancing is either speech or not speech.
QUESTION:

Well, Justice White's question puts

23

this point.

Could you prohibit this performance — you

24

don't want to call it a dance — if the women were

25

clothed?

MR. UHL:

2

QUESTION:

3

Of the first ■— I thought — the

dancing wouldn't — clothed or unclothed —

4

MR. UHL:

5

QUESTION:

6

Not on the basis of

Oh.
— it wouldn't — the message would

not change or the lack of it wouldn't change.

7

MR. UHL:

No, our position is that the dancers

8

would still have to show that if they took off their

9

clothes that there's an extra message.
QUESTION:

10

No, that's no — suppose the dancers

11

were clothed and suppose the State of Indiana or a police

12

official attempted to prohibit that performance, a clothed

13

performance, would the First Amendment protect the

14

performer?
MR. UHL:

15

No, not these performances in this

16

case.

17

it would be permissible to pass a statute prohibiting tap

18

dancing?

19
20
21
22

QUESTION:

MR. UHL:

Unless tap dancing were shown to be

speech under the First Amendment, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Well, but under your view it doesn't

convey any particular message so you could prohibit it.

23

MR. UHL:

24

QUESTION:

25

Then you're saying

That's correct, Your Honor.
Well, you might not be able to

prohibit under some other provision in the Constitution.

You just say it wouldn't be protected by the First

Amendment.

Obviously due process

QUESTION:

6

MR. UHL:

Could the State prohibit rock music?
Your Honor, this Court found in the

7

Ward case that rock music is speech under the First

8

Amendment, so no, it could not.

9

QUESTION:

But —

Well, how is it that music is

10

protected but dance is not?

11

MR. UHL:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. UHL:

Music is different —
Could you explain that?
Music is different from dance in that

14

the very nature of the medium is communicative.

16

respondents —

QUESTION:

Do you think some of the rock music

played in the Ward case conveyed a message?

MR. UHL:

QUESTION:

22

MR. UHL:

23

An artistic message.
An artistic message?
An artistic message.

Yes, Your Honor.

Whereas not all dance conveys an artistic message.

Well, I suggest not all music does

either.

MR. UHL:

1

That may be a case-by-case

2

determination and this Court hasn't addressed that except

3

in Ward to say that music in general is communicative and

4

therefore is speech under the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

5
6

Well, dance in general might be

communicative under that test, might it not?

7

MR. UHL:

We would resist that, Your Honor,

8

because dance can be so broadly defined as to include

9

perhaps what I'm doing here today.

10

QUESTION:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. UHL:

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. UHL:

Dance can be any —

Song and dance.

Well, not that kind of song and dance.

The respondents have suggested that a

15

production in which nudes simply stand nude on a stage

16

would be dance or that if someone were to simply — rhythm

17

is not important to the definition of a dance.

18

Improvisation can be dance according to the respondents.

19

Any movement can be defined as dance.

20

were to hold that all dance as it's defined there is

21

speech, then the First Amendment would be trivialized to

22

include any kind of movement or motion that expresses some

23

kind of emotion.

MR. UHL:

The statute doesn't

It doesn't ban performances.

It simply

10

requires that anytime a person in Indiana appears in

11

public that vital areas of the body be covered.

12

that reason this is the type of general criminal

13

prohibition that this Court — such as the one in

14

Employment Division v. Smith — held can be applied

15

consistent with the First Amendment, notwithstanding a

16

claim that the conduct at issue is protected — is speech

17

or religious practice under the First Amendment.

QUESTION:

Mr. Uhl, I'm interested in one of

19

your answers to Justice Kennedy.

obscenity here?

Are we dealing with

No, Your Honor.

There has never been

a contention in this case that the dancing at issue is

obscene.

QUESTION:

So the State stands by its concession

that we are not dealing with obscenity?

1

MR. UHL:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
If we were to find that an emotional

3

communication as opposed to a particularized message were

4

protectable, what would you then say to the argument on

5

the other side that they simply cannot communicate the

6

message in any other way except by nude dancing?

7

what they're saying in effect is that some kind of a

8

medium-is-the-message argument.

9

MR. UHL:

I think

If the medium is the message, Your

10

Honor, then it's our contention that the nudity is not an

11

essential part of that particular medium.

12

be communicated just as effectively, or almost as

13

effectively, with pasties and g-strings covering the vital

14

parts of the body that are at issue under the statute.

15

And it's our contention that alternative means of

16

communication are open to these plaintiffs and that the

17

mere requirement of — that the certain parts of the body

18

be covered is not essential to their communication.

19

QUESTION:

The dance can

So you're saying they cannot define

20

their activity by saying the medium and the message are

21

identical and thereby evade the possibility of otherwise

22

permissible First Amendment regulation?

23

MR. UHL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In one

24

sense their claim that nudity is an inherent part of their

25

dance is no different than someone who might be putting on

a play and decide that the use of marijuana during the

2

play is also protected because it's connected with this

3

protected play.

4

reject that argument out of hand, that that kind of

5

criminal conduct, even though it's in the context of a

6

protected production, can be criminalized by a State.

7

I think the court would immediately

QUESTION:

I suppose -- you say that even if

8

dancing nude might communicate a different message than

9

complying with the statute, these particular dancers have

10

never claimed or indicated that they were — had any such

11

message to deliver I gather.

12

MR. UHL:

That's correct.

One of the

13

respondents in this case submitted an affidavit where she

14

said that she intended to communicate and to entertain and

15

then she stopped and didn't tell us what she intended to

16

communicate or entertain.

17

Sutro, also failed to submit any other evidence of the

18

type of dancing that she wanted to perform.

19

submit a videotape, as did some of the respondents, nor

20

did she even just submit to the court a verbal or written

21

description of the dancing that she wished to perform.

QUESTION:

And that respondent, respondent

She did not

What — would the case really be

different if the dancer had a sign up at — on the stage

and some message with it and then said, I'll illustrate to

2

you how nice it is to be nude or something like that?

3

Would that be a different case?

4

MR. UHL:

No, Your Honor, that would be no

5

different than the case in Florida of the sunbathers who

6

claimed that they wanted to bathe out on the beach, and

7

show —

9

QUESTION:

But it's different in the sense that

you have a particularized message, and the dance is

10

suppose to dramatize this message that she's also got a

11

sign stating it.

12

MR. UHL:

In terms of the particularized

13

message, then it would be a different case.

14

very well —

15

QUESTION:

You could

Then you'd say that one would be

16

protected, but as long as they don't put such signs up,

17

it's unprotected.

18

MR. UHL:

It would be speech.

And whether it

19

would be protected then is the question of whether the

20

State can regulate it, and it would be our position that

21

under this statute we can still require her to wear the

22

minimal covering because — regardless of the fact that

23

it's speech.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. UHL:

And why is that?
Well, it's either because of the

application of Employment Division v. Smith, because this

2

is a general criminal statute, or it's by application of

3

the reasonable time, place, and manner test that this

4

Court has applied in other contexts.

QUESTION:

Reasonable time, place, and manner

being there's no reasonable time, place, or manner —

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. UHL:

10

— for this kind of dance.
Your Honor, reasonable place in that

the statute is limited to a public place.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. UHL:

Okay.
And the Indiana courts have very

13

carefully defined public place.

14

this is a restriction simply on the manner of appearing,

15

that is that there are certain parts of the body that need

16

to be covered, and it's our position that that is

17

sufficient narrowly tailored, just as the clothing on the

18

dancers is narrowly tailored, to accomplish the State's

19

interests in prohibiting public nudity.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. UHL:

Reasonable manner in that

How about the O'Brien test?
Well, this Court has found -- in the

22

Clark case the Court indicated that the O'Brien test is

23

really no different than the reasonable time, place, and

manner test.

25

basically it's the same test.

government interest that is forwarded by the statute in a

manner that leaves open alternative means of

precisely, but I think the Court indicated in Clark that

they're basically the same test.

Mr. Uhl, if there were a videotape of

7

these performances, could the State ban outright the sale

of the tape?
MR. UHL:

9

No, Your Honor, because the videotape

10

would not be live conduct, and the statute only goes to —

11

and our First Amendment argument only applies to live

12

conduct as opposed to depictions.

13

Yes, I'm asking you whether a statute

Why can you ban the

real thing but not the videotape of it?

MR. UHL:

This Court has always made a

21

distinction between depictions of conduct and live conduct

22

itself.

23

something that is traditionally subject to State

24

regulation and is something that more vividly presents the

25

concerns that are at interest when the State try --

The Court has always

Are you saying that this is sexually

explicit conduct and that that's a category that we can

use to sustain the law?
MR. UHL:

We're not arguing that it's a special

category that therefore is excluded from the First

However, I believe there is some support for

Not off the top of my head, Your

Honor.
There's another aspect of it that is also —

falls into that kind of category and that is the

18

commercial nature of the speech.

19

that because this is commercial-type speech that it

20

therefore falls into the category of advertising.

21

that doesn't change the fact that at least one of the

22

respondents said that the only reason that she dances nude

23

is in order to make more money. And we think that in

balancing the impact of the statute against the rights of

that's done largely for a commercial purpose.
QUESTION:

That's why Dickens wrote his books,

too.
MR. UHL:

Well, Your Honor, it's different.

6

Dickens wrote his book largely because he needed income,

not only because he needed income, and there's a

distinction there to be made.

You're sure about that?

MR. UHL:

I'm sure what Darlene Miller's intent

was, Your Honor, and that was to make money.
QUESTION:

Yes, but your supreme court

14

distinguishes between the opera singer and this dancer and

15

I suppose the opera singer wants to make money, too.

16

MR. UHL:

That's true, although again the opera

17

singer is in the position where that's not the only thing

18

that she wants to do, but that the money is an important

19

part of it.

20

that she's making money.

was their only motive?

2

MR. UHL:

No, Your Honor, only Darlene Miller

did.

4

the Chippewa Book Store had a commercial motive as well

because there is evidence in the record that the reason

she was dancing at the Chippewa Book Store was to promote

a movie that was playing at the drive-in next door.

I have no doubt that the rock musicians would

have said that the full impact of their music was lessened

by the restrictions on the volume there, and the dancers

here may very well say that the full impact of their

restriction.

Yes, Your Honor.
So if the particularized message

the line between the higher and lower form.

the Court holds that, then we still believe that this is a

reasonable regulation upon the dancing.

I gather you're saying that they

Is

that your interpretation of the case?

MR. UHL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The second element of the reasonable time,

communication of some emotional content were sufficient to

qualify for First Amendment scrutiny, would the effect of

Baysinger be that this conduct would be allowed and that

would be the end of the case?

MR. UHL:

No, Your Honor, I think Baysinger

would then very much be cut back, because if this Court

that we can still restrict this activity consistent with

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Nude dancing is sufficiently expressive to at

least trigger First Amendment analysis for two independent

reasons.

performance dance is inherently expressive of emotions and

ideas, and second, because nude dancing communicates a

that, because of the concerns as in Sable of a captive

see or the possibility of children being present.

It is our

All through the Seventh Circuit, in 5 years of

As this Court said in Hanaghan unanimously, what to one

man is trash may to others have fleeting or even enduring

values and it is not business of the State to determine

The First Amendment

California, one man's lyric is another's vulgarity.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE E. UHL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. UHL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
We believe the second issue presented in the

22

petition is properly before the Court for three reasons.

23

First, as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out, the issue

24

was clearly raised in our petition for certiorari and

25

there was no suggestion of waiver in the respondents'

briefs in opposition.
Second, the issue was fully decided by all of

2

3

the judges of the Seventh Circuit below.

4

concurring judge, after addressing the merits, suggested

5

that the issued may have been waived.

6

the majority opinion in which the court clearly applied

7

but found lacking our statute under the reasonable, time,

8

place, and manner test.

But he, too, joined

And finally, we believe the issue is fairly

10

included within the first issue that's presented, that at

11

— resolution to the First Amendment issue in this case

12

would be unsatisfactory if the Court simply stopped at a

13

determination of whether this activity is speech without

14
15
16
17

also determining whether or not it's regulable under this
statute.

So we believe the question is fairly before the

Court.
QUESTION:

May I ask you on that, Judge Posner

18

said that both the State's highest court and the law

19

enforcement officials concurred in interpreting the

20

statute, not as a blanket prohibition of public nudity.

21

Is that — do you still think it is not a blanket

22

prohibition of public nudity or do you now take the

23

position it is a blanket prohibition?

MR. UHL:

No, you — are going to have to give

Yes, Your Honor, we've made

alternative arguments here.
QUESTION:

For the purpose —

Have you ever before argued that it's

a blanket prohibition of public nudity, including operas

and the like?

13

No, Your Honor.
So, but you are making that argument

now?
MR. UHL:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we believe the

statute stands under that argument.
QUESTION:

And you believe that your opponent

14

reasonably should have anticipated that argument when he

15

filed his brief in opposition to your cert, petition?

16

MR. UHL:

Yes, Your Honor, because the Seventh

17

Circuit clearly went ahead and addressed that issue and

18

then in our second issue in the cert, petition we clearly

19

raised that issue:

— the public nudity statute — is a valid —

whether or not this statute is a valid

You don't — in your second

How should I interpret the statute as

I face this case?

As a blanket prohibition or as a

7

partial prohibition?

8

MR. UHL:

As a blanket prohibition, Your Honor.

As we suspected, the respondents have argued

10

here today that basically any conduct anywhere that

11

resembles dance is speech.

13

it's in a window in carwash, such as Justice Kennedy

14

suggested, or out in the public park.

15

Court has ever held that a State is required to come in

16

with a common law crime that was in existence many, many

17

years before the Constitution and the First Amendment were

18

adopted and justify that statute as applied to live

19

conduct.

The burden is then on the

There's been quite a bit of discussion during

reasonable determination that is reasonably related to the

goals of the statute, then the First Amendment does not

And that's a matter for the State courts and the
