ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. LINK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LINK:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
There are four issues before the Court in our

11
12

briefs.

13

will rely upon the arguments that are in the briefs.

14

If we don't get to talk about all of them, we

The first issue involves the death penalty, the

15

death sentence that was imposed.

with three counts of first-degree murder in Jacksonville

in Florida.

18

charged of two of the three counts of first-degree murder.

19

Mr. Parker was charged

The jury at his trial found him guilty as

After receiving additional mitigating evidence

20

in a penalty phase trial, they recommended life sentences

21

for both murders.

22

in which they found that mitigating circumstances

23

outweighed aggravating circumstances.

They filled out a specific verdict form

The trial judge overruled their recommendation
as to one of the murders and sentenced Mr. Parker to

He found that there were six aggravating

2

circumstances, no mitigating circumstances, despite the

3

jury finding that mitigation outweighed aggravation and

4

despite uncontroverted mitigating evidence that was in the

5

record.

The Florida supreme court —

6

QUESTION:

What did he have to say?

7

MR. LINK:

He stated that there were no

8

mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating

9

circumstances.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, that doesn't mean there

aren't -- isn't -- aren't any mitigating circumstances.
MR. LINK:

The trial court judge and the Florida

13

supreme court so found that his -- found that there were

14

no mitigating circumstances.

15

QUESTION:

The --

Well, what -- but what did the -- the

16

trial judge said there are no mitigating circumstances

17

that outweigh the aggravating?

18

MR. LINK:

Yes, sir, and he found no mitigating

19

circumstances at all in his sentencing order.

20

sentencing order tracks the statutory mitigating

21

circumstances under Florida law.

22

The trial court judge however, during argument — excuse

23

me -- during the penalty phase trial, provided the jury

24

with an instruction that there were additional mitigating

25

circumstances; that is, he told the jury that they could

2

or any other aspect of or circumstances of the offense.

3

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the,

the trial

4

judge didn't consider all the evidence?

5

trial judge expressly found that all the evidence was

6

considered.

7

MR. LINK:

The trial judge —

8

QUESTION:

I mean it,

I thought the

it would appear from the

language used by the trial judge that indeed all this

10

other mitigating evidence was, was received.

11

considered.

12

aggravating circumstances.

13

It was

It was weighed, but not found to outweigh the

MR. LINK:

I don't think we could say that

1.4

because of the fact that he went through the statutory

15

mitigating circumstances and discussed them at great

16

length and made absolutely no mention of the mitigating

17

circumstances even though he had instructed the jury on

18

the mitigating circumstances as,

19

mitigating -- statutory mitigating circumstance.

20

QUESTION:

as an eighth

Well, didn't he just instruct the

21

jury that they could find these were mitigating

22

circumstances,

23

not that they had to?

MR. LINK:

Yes,

sir,

that is correct.

But he

24

made no mention of any analysis of those mitigating

25

circumstances in his sentencing order, while he did as to

the statutory mitigators.

2

analysis such as it was, was that there were no mitigating

circumstances found by the trial court judge.

That was

That's what the Florida supreme court said.

QUESTION:

I think that's pretty

Well, under, under Florida law, he's

11

required to, to weigh the statutory mitigating

12

circumstances against aggravating as I understand it.

13

that correct?

14

.MR. LINK:

15

QUESTION:

Is he required to weigh nonstatutory

mitigating circumstances against the aggravating

17

circumstances?
MR. LINK:

Is

Yes, sir.

16

18

He

Yes, Your Honor, he is.

However, at

19

the time that this case was decided by the Florida supreme

20

court, as the Florida supreme court later said, they were

21

not requiring State court judges or juries to consider

22

nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.

let them hear about it, there's no problem.

1

in Hitchcock in 1987, the Florida supreme court has acted

2

to correct that problem.
QUESTION:

3

Well, may I interrupt you, Mr. Link?

4

You said that and, and in answer to Justice Souter's

5

question that Florida law required a weighing of

6

nonstatutory mitigating circumstances against aggravating

7

circumstances.

8

that, but at the time of this trial, it required just the

9

opposite, didn't it?

10

Now the statute has since 1985 required

It merely required that the

statutory mitigating circumstances be weighed.

11

MR. LINK:

12

not require it.

13

under Lockett —

14

I stand corrected.

The statute did

The law required it as interpreted under,

QUESTION:

Under Lockett, but the Florida

15

statute, one just reading the Florida statute and not

16

paying attention to Lockett might not have done it that

17

way.

18

MR. LINK:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

The issue

19

as to the death sentence in this case is whether the

20

standards used by the Florida supreme court to approve

21

jury overrides are subject to Eighth Amendment review.

22

The State's position is and has been that once

23

an override is affirmed by the Florida supreme court, that

24

becomes a matter of State law and that it is insulated

25

from Federal review.

That's the be all and end all.

Our

1

position is that the State cannot develop a constitutional

2

procedure to safeguard against the arbitrary application

3

of the death penalty and then refuse to use it in an

4

individual case.
QUESTION:

5
6

Even though it didn't have to develop

it in the first place?

7

MR. LINK:

Yes, sir.

In other words, just

8

because they did not have to give a jury recommendation

9

any weight at all, once the — once it is established,

10

that is, they have established a constitutional procedure

11

which this Court has approved —
QUESTION:

12

Well, you say they've established a

13

constitutional procedure, what do you mean by a

14

constitutional procedure?

15

Constitution or one that is required by the Federal

16

Constitution?

17

MR. LINK:

One that is permitted by the

I would say a constitutional

18

procedure in death penalty parlance is one that has been

19

approved by this Court.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but you don't answer my

21

question.

I asked you whether you mean required or

22

permitted by the Constitution?
MR. LINK:

23

It is — we do not say that it is

24

required.

25

But once the State establishes that procedure, they have

QUESTION:

Well, then what's your basis — what

is the constitutional basis for that statement?
MR. LINK:

That is exactly what this Court found

7

in Godfrey v. Georgia.

We feel that that is exactly the

8

principle that Godfrey stands for.

9

the State establishes a constitutional -- or a

In other words, once

10

construction of a standard for imposing the death penalty,

11

they cannot then refuse to apply it in an individual case.

12

That's what happened in Godfrey v. Georgia.

developed a constitutional construction of a statutory

14

aggravating circumstance.

15

not utilize that statutory construction, that

16

constitutional construction, in judging his case.

17

that was the error that permitted the arbitrary

18

application of the death penalty in that instance.

19

feel that that is exactly what happened here.

The State had

But in Godfrey's case they did

And

So we

The Tedder standard under Florida law is that a

21

trial judge must give a jury recommendation great weight

22

and can overrule it only if the facts suggesting a

23

sentence of death are so clear and convincing that

24

virtually no reasonable person could differ.

1

the Florida supreme court in this case find or conclude

2

that no reasonable person could have failed to impose the

3

death sentence in this case?

4

MR. LINK:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the Florida

5

supreme court did not apply their construction or standard

of review for reviewing overrides in this case.

7

standard for reviewing overrides is the reasonable basis

test which was developed in the case of Malloy, Richardson

and numerous other cases cited in the briefs.

Their

The

10

reasonable basis test for reviewing jury overrides

court of the State?
MR. LINK:

No, Your Honor, we're not.

QUESTION:

Why aren't you?

MR. LINK:

We are asking this Court to require

the Florida supreme court to apply that standard.

We're

not asking this Court to second-guess it or to say
that —
QUESTION:

Well, we, we can't tell that they

haven't applied it without, without entering into the
factual inquiry and, and concluding that they were wrong.
I mean, you're telling us that there's no basis in the
record for, for their conclusion, right?

And that

therefore they couldn't have been acting the way they're
supposed to.
MR’. LINK:

No, sir, because the, the court told

us what it did here.

They told us in the opinion that

they did not use a reasonable basis test.

They told us

what the basis of affirming the override was.

Their

entire discussion relating to the override was that the
trial court found no mitigating circumstances to balance
against the aggravating circumstances, of which four were
properly applied.

In light of these findings, the facts

suggesting a sentence of death are so clear and convincing
that virtually no reasonable person could differ.
They based their entire decision in this case on

1

the fact that the trial judge found no mitigating

2

circumstances.

3

There was no reasonable basis analysis performed in this

4

case.

5

tell us right in the body of the opinion what they based

6

their decision on and it is a basis that was virtually

7

unprecedented and it certainly is contrary to what they've

8

done in virtually every other case involving jury

9

overrides.

That's it.

They didn't go beyond that.

They -- we know that because they tell us.

QUESTION:

10

They

Mr., Mr. Link, how do you distinguish

11

the claim you're making from the claim that the capital

12

defendant in Lewis against Jeffers last term made,

13

claiming that the Arizona supreme court had not

14

consistently applied its own capital sentencing decisions.

15

And we rejected that claim.

16

of Federal law.

17

MR. LINK:

We said that's not a matter

In -- yes, sir -- thank you.

In the

18

Lewis v. Jeffers case, it involved a standard of review

19

that was constitutional on its face and the State court

20

said that it applied that standard within the body of its

21

opinion.

22

with the application of that standard is not a matter of

23

Federal law and we would agree with that decision.

24

situation here is that the court, that is, the Florida

25

supreme court, has created a standard for reviewing jury

The mere fact that this Court might disagree

They don't

say they don't apply it.

have performed a reasonable basis analysis.

examined the record.

5

for determining that the jury — that there was a -- no

6

reasonable basis for the jury override.

7

they found in the body of the opinion, then we would be in

8

the Lewis v. Jeffers category.

9

more — we are in the Godfrey v. Georgia category, where

In other words, they said we
We have

We have found no reasonable basis

If that was what

We are not.

We are

10

the court has a standard but refuses to apply it to this

11

case.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Link, isn't the, isn't the

13

portion of the standard that you claim they didn't apply,

14

the standard that requires them to make some kind of an

15

independent review of the record to determine whether they

16

believe there are mitigating circumstances?

17

MR. LINK:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

So if they had said not merely that

19

the trial court found none, but had said we have

20

independently reviewed the record and we find no basis for

21

concluding that mitigating circumstances were present, you

22

would not have an argument?

23

MR. LINK:

That is correct.

We would be -- the

24

only argument that we would have would be that there would

25

be the Jackson v. Virginia rational tryer effect argument

1

that was presented in Lewis v. Jeffers.
QUESTION:

2

Yes, sir.

Are we entitled to assume that the

3

Florida court followed its own law even though it did not

4

expressly say so?
MR. LINK:

5

I think we have to assume they did

6

not where in this case they said they did not.

7

us — they tell us the basis for their decision —
QUESTION:

8

9

did not do it.

They told

Well, they didn't tell us that they

They simply spoke of the appropriateness

10

of what the trial court did and they didn't specifically

11

say, we have gone through this independent analysis.

12

silence on their part, isn't it, rather than a confession

13

of error?

14

MR. LINK:

It's

I don't believe so, because they say

15

in light of these findings, referring to the trial court's

16

findings.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Link, you're, you're quoting from

18

page 71 of the Joint Appendix, but if you will look on

19

page 70, the Florida supreme court before saying, the

20

trial court found no mitigating circumstances; in light of

21

these findings, we think it's correct -- on page 70, the

22

first full paragraph, the court says, in addition to

23

considering all other issues raised on appeal, we have

24

conducted an independent review of the record on trial and

25

find no reason to award a new trial.

MR. LINK:

Yes, sir, that, that was --

2

QUESTION:

So apparently they did conduct an

3

independent review of the record.

4

MR. LINK:

Yes, sir.

5

QUESTION:

They have said that.

6

MR. LINK:

Yes, sir, they did do that in

7

reference to any issues to award a new trial.

That was as

8

to the guilt phase.

9

indication that they have evaluated the record to see if

They present no discussion or no

10

there is any — there are any mitigating circumstances --

11

QUESTION:

12

phase, that statement?

You think that does not go to the sentencing

MR. LINK:

13

Yes, sir.

There's nothing in the

14

opinion that says it goes to the sentencing phase.

15

simply says, accordingly, after having done this review,

16

the convictions are affirmed.

17

QUESTION:

It

May I ask you, Mr. Link, if the

18

Florida supreme court's practice changed at all in the

19

period right after 1984 and 1985 in what they did in these

20

cases?

21

MR. LINK:

Yes, Your Honor, it did.

The Florida

22

supreme court recognized that its application of the

23

Tedder standard was — I described as aberrational.

24

think they recognize it as just, as being just that.

25

During 1984 and 1985, they were affirming overrides at a

rate of 73 percent during that time.

2

the affirmant's rate has been in the vicinity of 20

percent.

4

QUESTION:

The following years

But not just on statistics in view of

5

their legal approach.

6

this — the change in time, they were not relying at all

7

on nonmitigating, nonstatutory mitigating circumstances

8

in, in reviewing overrides, whereas after that period they

9

did it rather regularly?

10

MR. LINK:

Is it not correct that prior to

I think for any — every general

11

principle one can say about the Florida supreme court one

12

can find exceptions and I, I think that there are a number

13

of cases where the Florida supreme court did rely on

14

nonstatutory mitigating circumstances prior to 1984 and

15

1985.

16

However, the court subsequently admitted that they were

17

not giving considerations necessarily to nonstatutory

18

mitigation in the case of Downs v. Dugger which is cited

19

in the brief.

20

a skewed type of analysis that was being performed by the

21

Florida supreme court.

22

did give weight to nonstatutory mitigating circumstances

23

and in other instances did not.

24
25

So during this time frame, it was certainly

It seemed that they occasionally

all of the nonstatutory mitigating evidence that was

present in this case was in other cases a sufficient basis

QUESTION:

May I ask you another question?

I'm

not sure you answered it.

Yes.

QUESTION:

How often are jury's, jury

12

It was because the

that if one looks at the Tedder standard, it in fact is

override that took place -- as I understood the issue

7

before the Court, it was whether the left open question in

8

Spaziano was before this Court — what standard should be

9

applied in individual cases?

Should it be an analysis

10

that has been discussed by this Court with regard to

11

Walton and Lewis v. Jeffers and in fact Godfrey v.

12

Georgia, or in fact is there an independent State basis

13

because Tedder is a State standard and therefore there is

14

nothing beyond a determination that the standard is

15

appropriate, the court does routinely apply --

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you a -- may I ask you a

17

couple of preliminary questions --

18

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

— on this, because I have the

20

feeling as I read through the papers that the — all the

21

reference to Tedder just confuses the issue and that what

22

the district court found in this case was Hitchcock error,

23

that there were nonstatutory mitigating circumstances that

24

the record does not indicate that the trial judge even

25

considered.

Now would you agree there are nonstatutory

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

I would say there were

6

QUESTION:

Whether it was

Well, for example, the district court

relied on the fact the defendant was intoxicated at the

time of the offense and that the Florida court has

repeatedly said that's a nonstatutory mitigating

circumstance.

Do you think that was not established by

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

I don't believe that there was

sufficient evidence to show that he was intoxicated.

There was evidence during the course of the record to

reflect that they had ingested drugs and had been drinking

or had drinks during the day.

having rejected as a matter of fact the evidence that he

was intoxicated?

23

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Based on this particular

record, that is correct.
QUESTION:

And how about the second nonstatutory

mitigating circumstance the district judge relied on,

25

namely the disparity in the sentencing?

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

1

Well, in fact the disparity in

the sentencing is a very good point, because in fact the

person -- the ah, Elaine Parker, who was his ex-wife,

QUESTION:

13

Well, without getting into the

detail, you then agree with the district judge in this

case that the petitioner's accomplices and codefendants

16

receive lesser sentences for their parts in the Sheppard

murder.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

other sentences — there were other sentences other

But if that is true and if, as he

says by citing a bunch of Florida cases, that is regarded

as a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance, how do we know

the judge gave consideration to it or didn't give

This trial judge was also the

Are you saying that it was not a

nonstatutory mitigating circumstance -- there was no such

nonstatutory mitigating circumstance or that he took it

into account and weighed it against the aggravating

circumstances?
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

10

The trial judge in this

was not a valid nonstatutory mitigating circumstance based

on the facts and Mr. Parker's participation in the Nancy

establishing whether or not he gave consideration to these

to have been established by the evidence?

13

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

supreme court and make an assessment as to whether in fact

review that which the Florida supreme court has done and

one of the most difficult things for the State to sustain

In fact,

That 30 percent figure wasn't true

during the period 1982 to 1984?

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Right.

That's absolutely

correct.

11

remember what has occurred during that period of time.

This Court had just decided Spaziano, and to suggest that

the Court was not aware of what was occurring in Spaziano

been very difficult and the Florida supreme court has not
