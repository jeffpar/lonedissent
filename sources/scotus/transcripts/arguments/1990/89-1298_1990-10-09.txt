Mr. Hurd, you may proceed whenever you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOLLIS T. HURD

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HURD:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This is an ERISA preemption case.

The Supreme

11

Court of Texas declared that the State of Texas, quote,

12

"has an interest in protecting employees' interests in

13

pension plans," and held that a terminated employee can

14

recover under the common law of Texas whenever he proves

15

that the principal reason for his termination was the

16

employer's desire to avoid contributing to or paying

17

benefits under the employee's pension fund.

18

4 decision in which the dissenters pointed out that this

19

new common law cause of action under Texas law was

20

preempted by ERISA.

It was a 5 to

Of course, the question of whether a Federal

21
22

statute preempts a State law is a question of the intent

23

of Congress.

24

93d Congress in passing ERISA is perfectly clear in every

25

respect.

Petitioner submits that the intent of the

1

In the language of ERISA where the express

2

preemption provision preempts any State law that relates

3

to an employee benefit plan, and this law clearly relates

4

to pension plans; from the structure of ERISA, because

5

Congress inserted in ERISA itself a provision which is

6

numbered 510 of ERISA which does essentially the same

7

thing as the Texas law common law cause of action, and

8

which demonstrates that Congress thought that protection

9

against purposeful interference with rights under a plan

10

was not remote, peripheral, or tangential but was central

11

to the business of regulating employee benefit plans.

12

Next, from the enforcement provisions of ERISA

13

which this Court has held are comprehensive, interrelated

14

and exclusive, and those are the means for enforcing

15

section 510 of ERISA.

16

Next, from the legislative history of ERISA,
i

17

which demonstrates clearly as this Court has previously

18

held in the Shaw case that Congress intended to preempt at

19

a minimum all State laws treating the same subjects as

20

ERISA, and the Texas law clearly treats the same subject

21

as ERISA section 510 does; and finally, from the purposes

22

of ERISA preemption.

23

ERISA is to promote and protect employees' interests in

24

pension plans.

25

QUESTION:

The purpose of every provision of

question if I may.

This is a case in which, as I

2

understand it, the Texas court said that because your

3

opponent's client was terminated allegedly in order to

4

escape a pension fund liability that that's -- that

5

preemption applies.

6

of termination is Federal.

This exclusive remedy for that kind
Is that right?

7

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

What if they had had a written

9

contract.

ERISA

Supposing a man had — an executive had a

10

20-year written contract that guaranteed him at the end of

11

20 years participation in the pension fund, maybe a car

12

when he leaves the company and two or three other things,

13

and in the 19th year they fired him in breach of the

14

written contract, and he was able to at least allege

15

and -- and prove that the reason they did it, they wanted

16

to escape their pension liability.

17

Would he have any cause of action in State court

18

for any percent — part of the salary he didn't get for

19

his 19th year and so forth?

20

MR. HURD:

In that case, Your Honor, if the

21

employer's motivation is alleged to be a purpose to

22

interfere with the attainment of benefits under a plan --

23

QUESTION:

Right.

24

MR. HURD:

— then that would stay a claim under

25

section 510 of ERISA, and that State law, whatever State

1

law was used, contract or misrepresentation and so forth,

2

that State law would be preempted as applied to that cause

3

of action.

4

QUESTION:

Even if his damages that he seeks are

5

the salary for the 19th year -- the 20th year of the

6

contract?

7

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

Would he have a remedy for those

9

damages in -- in Federal court?

10

MR. HURD:

Absolutely.

That's my next point.

11

Under section 510 of ERISA, the lower courts

12

have held that uniformly that the relief available is

13

employment-related relief.

14

order the individual reinstated to employment.

15

can also order back pay and front pay and also damages

16

equal to the value of the lost benefits.

17

That is to say, the courts can
The courts

In other words, the wrong is — is an employment

18

action, and the remedy is to reverse that employment

19

action.

QUESTION:

20

21

It's not to award benefits.
And that State rule of law, as you

interpret, relates to the plan?

22

MR. HURD:

Yes, it does, Your Honor, through the

23

employer's purpose to interfere with rights under the

24

plan.

25

Our point is that Congress set up the rights and

1

remedies for those who believe that the employer

2

purposefully interfered with our attainment of benefits

3

under a plan, and Congress' scheme is exclusive.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Hurd, under the Federal cause of

5

action that you say would exist under the circumstances

6

inquired about by Justice Stevens, would there be any

7

right to punitive damages?

8

9
10

MR. HURD:

Your Honor, the lower courts so far

have held that punitive damages are not available in
actions —

11

QUESTION:

What about attorneys' fees?

12

MR. HURD:

Under ERISA, Your Honor, attorneys'

13

fees may be granted in the discretion of the court to a

14

prevailing plaintiff.

15

QUESTION:

Counsel, what — what would happen in

16

Justice Stevens' hypothetical if there were three or four

17

independent reasons given for the termination?

18

tried -- they terminated early to avoid having to pay the

19

pension benefits.

20

infringing on — ah, exclusive sales territory that the

21

contract promised him.

22

reasons are usually alleged in these wrongful discharge

23

cases.

Two, because he was allegedly

And any number of different

If — if one of them is the ERISA reason, does
that preempt the whole cause of action?

MR. HURD:

-1

I would say, Your Honor, it preempts

2

the cause of action based on the employer's alleged

3

motivation to deprive the individual of benefits.

4

Now if the employee --

QUESTION:

6

What you say -- if — you said -- if

one of the motivations?

7

MR. HURD:

That's correct.

The — there is a

cause of action for purposeful interference with right to

benefits under a plan, and that cause of action is

10

preempted, including other nonpreempted cause of actions

11

in the complaint, doesn't.diminish the Federal character

12

of that one.
QUESTION:

May I push that just a step further?

Supposing he doesn't allege the reason; he just alleges

the written contract.

16

17

And then in defense they come in and say the real reason

18

we did it was this — they go to State law, and they get

19

ready to go to the jury, but their defense is in State

20

cause of action the real reason we did it is we didn't

21

want to pay him a pension.

He was ready, willing and able to

What do you do with that case if you're a State
judge?

1

relying on an alleged motivation to deprive the individual

2

of benefits, then that does not have any connection with a

3

reference to a plan.

4

to the plan is introduced, then his claim has a connection

5

with a reference to the plan.

QUESTION:

As soon as the element of connection

If it comes out on discovery and he

7

then says I didn't know what the reason was but now I

8

realize the real reason was they wanted to save money on

9

the pension, then his case goes out the window as soon as

10

he finds that out?
MR. HURD:

11

Is that right?
The case becomes Federal in

12

character.

13

section 510 are to be heard exclusively in the Federal

14

courts.

MR. HURD:

In your question, Your Honor, I

haven't heard any connection with a reference to a plan.

they want him to quit is so that he won't —■ he won't

qualify for benefits.

3

MR. HURD:

If that --

QUESTION:

So -- so it is — it is, indeed — it

against him in order to prevent him from becoming entitled

No, this is — is an assault, civil

action for assault, tort.

13

MR. HURD:

Not a civil action.

QUESTION:

Couldn't bring a civil action?

15

MR. HURD:

There is a section 510 case —

QUESTION:

How about a wrongful death action?

17

They — they actually blow him away in order to — a

wrongful death action would not lie, either?

The examples can get

pretty extreme, but the principle is -QUESTION:

Well, but it's testing the principle

of whether any State law, no matter how generally

23

applicable, if it happens to overlap in its -- in its

24

relief with section 510 is -- is invalid.

25

MR. HURD:

Well, our point, Your Honor, is that

1

Congress decided what remedies should be available to

2

someone who believed that the employer discharged, fined,

3

expelled, et cetera, or otherwise discriminated against

4

them.
QUESTION:

5

So what is your answer to the

6

wrongful death?

7

was extreme, but — but what is your answer to it?

I didn't get your answer.

You said it

8

MR. HURD:

My answer is that would be preempted.

9

QUESTION:

Oh.

10

QUESTION:

What — you say this — this should

11

be a Federal cause of action.

12

denies that he -- he fired him for this reason, and so the

13

issue in the Federal case would — would be

14

whether -- whether he did it to interfere with the plan;

15

is that it?

Of course, the employer

16

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose the — suppose the employer

18

wins on that, that it -- that he didn't fire him for that

19

reason.

What happens to the employee's State cause of

20

action?

It's probably — is it to be dismissed?

21

think they should dismiss the State cause of action?

really —■ the employer really didn't interfere with plan

2

benefits.

That's the reason the employer wins.

3

MR. HURD:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

So what -- but he's nevertheless may

5

have a State claim.

6

MR. HURD:

Because the discharge was wrongful

7

for other reasons such as a breach of the common law

8

contract.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, exactly.

Exactly.

10

MR. HURD:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

So how does he protect himself while

12

this Federal case is dismissed, I mean while the State

13

cause of action is being dismissed?

14

you say it can't continue to be on file.

15

MR. HURD:

Can it just -- and

The Federal court would have pendent

16

jurisdiction over those purely State law claims while

17

considering the Federal cause of action under section 510.

18
19

QUESTION:

So he should bring his State law

claims with him in the Federal court?

20

MR. HURD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

May -- may I just add one point to

22

23

the question Justice Scalia was asking?
Although it sounds farfetched, there is in fact

24

a case under ERISA section 510 where an individual was a

25

participant in a multiemployer pension plan and alleged

1

that the trustees of the plan threatened him that they

2

would break his legs unless he ceased from insisting on

3

receiving information regarding the administration of the

4

plan.

5

section 510 of ERISA, and he prevailed.

6

That was held to state a cause of action under

QUESTION:

I'm sure it did, but the issue here

7

is whether it also states a valid cause of action under

8

State law, and the case did not hold that you couldn't.

9

Isn't there a difference as to whether, in order

10

to recover under State law you must prove that the purpose

11

was to deprive you of benefits under the plan?

12

case, that that was essential to recovering under the

13

State law, wasn't it?

In this

14

MR. HURD:

Absolutely.

15

QUESTION:

That you didn't fire him for no
ft

16

reason at all but precisely in order to prevent his

17

recovering.

18

Whereas, if someone comes up to me and threatens

19

to break my legs, it really doesn't matter what, you know,

20

what their reason is, does it?

action for assault.

22

23

whatever their reason was.

basis and say that only the former are preempted and not

1

the latter?

I wish you would, because I find it

2

very — very upsetting that there's no wrongful death

3

action.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HURD:

I suppose so, Your Honor.

The

6

section 510 ERISA relates to employment-type actions, and

7

I think that in your case assault or murder can reasonably

8

regarded as -- be regarded as not an employment-type

9

action.
QUESTION:

10

Well, more than that.

You don't have

11

to prove that the reason was to deprive you of benefits

12

under the plan.

13

It doesn't matter what the reason was.

MR. HURD:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

14

catching the drift of your question.

15

That's completely correct.

I'm just now

The cause of action

16

in order for the individual to prevail doesn't require any

17

connection to a plan.

18

connected, whereas in this case the cause of action exists

19

only because the employer's conduct is connected to a

20

plan.

QUESTION:

In that sense, it's not necessarily

Well, an assault doesn't require any

QUESTION:

But if —■ but if the -- but if it's

MR. HURD:

Is

If he can recover for assault merely

because he was in fact assaulted without regard to the

Well, if it's so clear, why didn't

MR. HURD:

The truth of the matter is, Your

you?

Honor, that the case was treated as a run-of-the-mill
wrongful discharge case from the very beginning.

After

Ingersoll-Rand demonstrated to Mr. McClendon that he was
in fact vested in his pension and had been vested before
he was terminated, that aspect of the case was not pushed
by Mr. McClendon, and so Ingersoll-Rand didn't work on a
defense.
It was really the Supreme Court of Texas that
resurrected that issue and addressed and decided the
Federal question that's presented here for this Court's
decision.

Yes, Your Honor.

The United States would like to emphasize that

Congress specifically intended ERISA's broad preemption

provision, section 502, to displace State law.

Life, this Court concluded, and I quote, "The deliberate

QUESTION:

I believe you

Nothing in that opinion says anything

about preemption.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, but the fact remains that

this Court has relied on the comprehensive nature of the

8

six remedies considered as a whole.

9

Now respondent here argues that his claim for

10

benefits is — I'm sorry, his claim for interference with

11

the attainment of benefits is different than a claim for

12

benefits, but we think that there are two sides to the

13

same coin, and we don't think that there is a basis, given

14

this Court's statements in Pilot Life and Russell, for any

15

distinction between a claim arising under section

16

502(a)(1)(b), the provision involving claims for benefits,

and section 502(a)(3), the provision that allows for

enforcement of section 510.

Related to this -- ah, question, I might say,

is — is the suggestion perhaps that section 510 as — as

a wrongful discharge remedy is not central to ERISA.

MR. WRIGHT:

We think it shows two things.

We

think the existence of section 510 shows that Congress

clearly understood that a wrongful discharge remedy

relates to ERISA and — and, hence, the State law claim is

preempted under 514(a).

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. TAVORMINA

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TAVORMINA:

15

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please this Honorable Court:

16

102 years ago, the Texas supreme court came down

17

with the Eastline decision which held unequivocally,

18

without exception, any employer could terminate any

19

employee for no reason at all -- the employment-at-will

20

doctrine, or sometimes referred to as the fire-at-will

21

doctrine.

22

Over the last century, the Texas court has

23

changed and developed that law to take its harsh remedies

24

and look at those harsh remedies in light of the realities

25

of today's environment.

The Texas supreme court has

doctrine.

4

all the contracts.

They have imposed that if the parties contract

Very recently, the Texas supreme court, based on

5
6

the public policy of the State, said, if an employee is

7

fired for refusing to commit a crime, well, we can't let

8

the employment-at-will doctrine prevent a cause of action

9

because our State public policy warrants, it mandates,

10

that we can't let that wrong go without redress, and the

11

court carved out another exception to the

12

employment-at-will doctrine and said, if you can prove

13

that the reason this employee was terminated was because

14

he failed to commit a crime, he will have, or she will

15

have, a State cause of action for wrongful termination.

16

In this case, the McClendon case, the court

17

again looked at the realities of today's employment

18

setting.

19

plans are — are so much more an essential element of our

20

employment packages today than they were in 1988, and the

court said, we have a public policy.

in protecting our employees, our men and women, with

respect to their pension benefits, and therefore, because

Your Honor, he did have a cause

QUESTION:

Certainly all the preemption

8

provisions of ERISA were not necessarily put in to protect

employees as opposed to employers?

10

MR. TAVORMINA:

No, Your Honor, but the key

11

element of the preemption provisions were to ensure

12

uniformity to the employers to avoid different processing

13

and different procedures in different States, if they

14

operated across State lines.

15

the preemption provision, and this cause of action created

by the Texas supreme court does absolutely nothing to the

uniformity of the structure of ERISA plans.

That was the key element of

one.

Your Honor, you're exactly

That is not the claim here.

MR. TAVORMINA:

But under the contract example,

years -- and the contract was then terminated after 19

It may be an element of damages, but

it is not, as it is in this suit, an element of the cause

of action.

12

to establish that the reason the firing occurred was to

13

prevent the vesting, and that is quite different from

14

merely being an element of the damages.

15

It is an element of the cause of action here,

MR. TAVORMINA:

Sir, it's different, but if you

16

look at the Court's decision in English v. GE, that was

17

the Energy Reorganization Act that was involved in that

18

case.

19

That act had a similar provision.
That was the case where a woman was fired.

She

20

had reported several times to GE that radioactive waste

21

had not been cleaned up properly, and her warnings were

22

ignored, and she put a big piece of red tape around it to

23

show how absurd things were getting, to point out that

things weren't being done in the workplace for safety, and

the employer wound up firing her for that.

QUESTION:

But there — there you didn't have

the express and preemption provisions that you do with

ERISA, did you?

7

MR. TAVORMINA:

No -- well, Your Honor, you

8

had -- you didn't have an express preemption provision,

9

but you had two very similar enforcement statutes, one

10

that said you couldn't discriminate or discharge an

Well, if you look at that cause, which the Court

treatment of preemption has been quite different in ERISA

and conditions of an ERISA plan, and that's what
preemption is supposed to go to.

Preemption was made so

there could be a uniform scheme that the employers could
use and rely upon.

It wasn't so you can take away causes

of action, and there are many cases — English v. GE is
one, but there are other cases where this Court has held
that just because a State court imposes additional
liability, or further liability than a Federal action,
that is not enough to preempt.
QUESTION:

Actually, it doesn't say that.

The

statute does not require that it relate to the terms or
conditions of an ERISA plan.

The statute simply says,

"relate to any employee benefit plan."
MR. TAVORMINA:

Your Honor, I agree with that,

but I also go back to the language of the definition of
State, where it says,

"regulates directly or indirectly

the terms or conditions of a pension plan."
If you go back to the original premise, you have
the State law and you have a Federal act which was meant
to protect the interest of employees and protect them from
things like fraud and misappropriation, and then Congress
said, but we -- we have to give something to the
employers, and we're going to let them have a uniform
plan.

Now, how is that affected by a State cause of

action?

1

Petitioner's explanation, and it

2

strikes me as a good one, is that the definition of the

3

term State to include political subdivisions that purport

4

to regulate is an expansion, so that you qualify as a

5

State even though you — ah -- you are not a State in the

6

narrow sense, if you purport to regulate.

7

But if you are a State, whether you're

8

purporting to regulate the terms and conditions of a plan

or not, if you are a State properly speaking,

10

you're -- you're bound by 514(a), it seems to me --

11

MR. TAVORMINA:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well, Your Honor, I —

And the test is whether it relates to

the plan.
MR. TAVORMINA:

When you say, whether it relates

15

to the plan, you have to go back to the terms and

16

conditions of a plan, or the administration of a plan

17

versus a cause of action for an employer's motivation.

18

Well, why do you have to do that?

Why, when the statutory language doesn't relate to any

20

employee benefit plan, do you have to go back to the terms

and conditions of the plan?

Because I think if you look at

What was the motivation

Finally, I want to — I would like to just talk

19

about the issue of damages.

20

21

not preclude a State cause of action in a traditionally

State-regulated field from imposing additional damages,

whether they be punitive damages, or whether they be

addressed by the Texas supreme court, and one of the

2

justices said it was an open question, but there are

3

several cases from this Court, including an antitrust

4

case, which was California v. ARC America, where this

5

Court said that just because a State cause of action gives

6

further liability, or additional liability, to a cause of

7

action similar to the Federal cause of action, that's not

8

enough for preemption, and that case -- as well, going

9

back to the Halifax case -- this Court has said, well, is

there any conflict?

this cause of action?

Is there a conflict with ERISA with

There is no conflict.

12

It's consistent, and just

consistent and there's no conflict, we're going to let the

State's public policy —

May I interrupt you there for a

moment?

that a very large punitive damages award against employers

who are funding their own plans could jeopardize the

safety of the financial soundness of the plan and that

21

there is a Federal interest in maintaining the financial

soundness which might be inconsistent with awards of — of

I would agree with that, Your

plans that the Government was trying to encourage if he

knew that he'd be subject to a -- a jury action in State

4

court for allegedly dismissing people in order to avoid

5

the rights vesting under the plan?

6

MR. TAVORMINA:

Well, Your Honor, if we use that

7

logic, then we're basically saying that because ERISA

8

limits the damages -- because I think everyone agrees that

9

there's nothing conflicting about the cause of action.

10

There is a cause of action in ERISA, and there is now, at

11

least at present, a State cause of action in Texas.
So then we'd be saying that the reason that

ERISA is preferred is because it has, or might have, less

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOLLIS T. HURD

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HURD:

12

I think it's important to understand

13

that, throughout ERISA, Congress was making a delicate

14

balance.

15

employees' interests in plans, there are two elements.

16

One is promoting the employees' rights, but the other part

17

of it is promoting the maintenance and establishment of

18

plans themselves.

19

When you talk about promoting and preserving

Section 510 enforced, through the remedies of

20

section 502, are the enforcement mechanism and the

21

remedies that Congress decided were appropriate and struck

22

the right balance between the employee's interest in

23

recovering damages and their desire not to discourage the

24

establishment and maintenance of plans.

25

To -- to take Justice Scalia's question, it's -38

you can imagine a grocery store with 20 employees in

2

Texas.

3

years, but very little turnover of employees after that.

4

It would make sense for the employer in that case to

5

establish a pension plan with 2-year cliff vesting, so

6

that no one was vested before 2 years, everyone was fully

7

vested after 2 years.

8

Suppose there's high turnover within the first 2

But the first time a jury verdict comes down

9

from the State court in Texas with punitive damages in it,

10

the employer's going to think very seriously about whether

11

he should alter the vesting schedule and make it the

12

maximum permitted by law -- 5-year cliff vesting, so as to

13

diminish the credibility of the claims of people who might

14

sue who were let go in the first 2 years.

15

course, would work to the disadvantage of the other

16

participants in the plan.

17

This, of

Another thing the employer might do in that

18

situation is install full and immediate vesting, so that

19

everyone is vested on the day they walk in, so that once

again, there's no risk of an employee who is terminated

claiming the termination was for the purpose of

1

the employer until retirement.

2

Congress decided that the balance that they

3

struck in sections 510 and 502 of ERISA was the

4

appropriate balance, so that employees had protections

5

without going so far as to discourage the establishment

6

and maintenance of plans.

7

In this way, section 510 clearly does relate to

8

plans.

Congress understood that there's really a

9

triangular relationship at work.

You have the plan, the

10

employer, and the employee, and all three sides of that

11

triangle relate to the plan.

12

The employee versus the plan is vesting claim

13

procedures, and so forth, the employer vis-a-vis the plan

14

is the funding requirements, for example, but equally

15

important is the employer versus the employee, whenever

16

the employer acts for the purpose of interfering with the

17

rights under the plan.

18

employment relationship is where it overlaps with the

19

field of employee benefit plans.

20

In that case, that aspect of the

When the Congress occupied the field of employee

21

benefit plans, it did occupy that portion of the

22

employment relationship precisely because it does relate

23

to employee benefit plans.

24
25

Back on the subject of force or the threat of
force, let me just note that the following section of

ERISA, section 511, makes it unlawful to employ force,

2

fraud, or the threat of force in order to interfere with

3

someone's right to benefits under a plan.

QUESTION:

May — may I just ask this one

question?

Am I correct that the Federal claim could be

brought in a State court, that would be based on a

QUESTION::

12

courts have exclusive --

QUESTION:

There's something in the conference

report that's quoted that says that whether it's brought

in State or Federal court, it's still a Federal cause of
