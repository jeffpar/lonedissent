ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARHAM:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This, or the issues for this Court arise out of

11
12

a suit for a specific performance for breach of a contract

13

in a Federal court in Louisiana.

14

owned a television station in Lake Charleston, Louisiana,

15

and it was a contract to purchase on that station.

16

was a nonresident purchaser, and that nonresident

17

purchaser filed suit in Federal court under the diversity

18

jurisdiction to enforce, by specific performance, the

19

contract.

20

A Louisiana resident

There

The Louisiana Civil Code provides for the

21

concepts of breach of contract, and also for the remedies

22

for breach of contract, including specific performance or

23

damages, or specific performance and damages, or specific

24

performance with delay damages.

are economic damages.

QUESTION:

They

And Louisiana

Well, Mr. Barham, does Louisiana

8

recognize any inherent right of a trial court judge to

9

impose sanctions on parties for conduct of litigation?

10

MR. BARHAM:

The only ones, Your Honor, are the

11

ones that are in the higher tiers, like contempt, those

12

kind of inherent powers which have, as, you know,

13

generally across the country they have been put into

14

legislative form.

15

power that is recognized, and that only.

necessary — useful, in the sense of useful.

17

necessary for the court to carry out its functions.

18

But it's that high tier of inherent

QUESTION:

Not the
Only those

So, so if an attorney knowingly

19

introduced perjured testimony or falsified documents in a

20

Louisiana State court, the Louisiana State court could

21

impose monetary sanctions?

22

MR. BARHAM:

The Louisiana State court could,

23

under its, the fact that all lawyers are in an integrated

24

bar and therefore the court rules the lawyers, they could

25

take care of the lawyers under that power that's given to

MR. BARHAM:

Under the, under the contempt — I

don't believe, I don't believe Louisiana has that power.

14

I question even whether the fine for contempt could carry

15

with it, even under Federal law, I would have to say I

question even whether it could carry attorneys' fees that

17

were attendant upon the fine in Federal law.

MR. BARHAM:

No.

I say that it has inherent

powers, and those have been defined in Alyeska.

White discussed the inherent power in question about a pot

to be divided —

QUESTION:

Justice

Well, haven't we said in Alyeska and

7

Roadway effectively that a Federal court has inherent

power to impose monetary sanctions for bad faith

litigation in its court?

MR. BARHAM:

But you have also said very clearly

in Alyeska that not for that — not in diversity.

QUESTION:

18

You mean footnote, the footnote, the

famous footnote?

15

17

That's

Yes.
Well, aren't you reading something

into that footnote that might not be there?
MR. BARHAM:

Well, I read it as in an ordinary

19

diversity case where the State law does not run counter to

20

a valid Federal statute or rule of court, a State denying

21

the right to attorneys' fees, which reflects a substantial

22

policy of the State, should be followed.

23

QUESTION:

Well, why doesn't that just mean in

24

an ordinary fee shifting situation where you have to

determine whether a cause of action carries with it fee

inherent power situation of the Federal court to control

6

that footnote has anything to do with that.

7

What does that footnote have to do with any

MR. BARHAM:

I don't see that

Well, may it please Your Honor, it

8

is a footnote to an exception to the general American rule

9

against fee shifting, which is the bad faith exception,

10

which means bad faith, vexatious conduct, during

11

litigation.

12

assume Justice White, speaking for the Court, intended

13

that that would be a meaning carried down into that

14

footnote, which is very clear and plain and goes on to say

15

the same would clearly hold for a judicially created rule,

16

which is the inherent power.

17

So if it's attached to that footnote, I would

QUESTION:

Mr. Barham, in a diversity case

Would the court be denied the right to punish him because

Suppose that, suppose, Mr. Barham,

11

that there was a Federal statute which said that in

impose — to shift attorneys' fees as a sanction for bad

14

faith conduct during trial.

MR. BARHAM:

Would that statute be

That's what you were kind of

17

considering yesterday, and we got copies of this opinion.

18

When you're looking under the rules of the Enabling Act,

19

you know, that's, to me, different --

QUESTION:

21

MR. BARHAM:

It's an Erie case whether it's

under the rule or whether it's under a statute or what.

Well, it's an Erie case, diversity —

QUESTION:

1

It's a diversity case.

And I suppose

2

whatever answer you give to that question, I suppose you

3

would give the same question if there was a rule of court?

4

MR. BARHAM:

Yes, sir.

First you'd have to

5

examine is the rule within the Enabling Act, or is the

6

rule constitutional.

7

QUESTION:

That's the only thing.
Well, of course, the famous footnote

8

in Alyeska said that where a State law that does not run

9

counter to a valid Federal statute, then all this follows.

10

But I suppose if there was a statute like that, your —

11

what you're urging would be counter to a Federal statute,

12

and then the question would be whether it was valid.
MR. BARHAM:

I think that's what you would have

to, to look to, and I don't believe you would hold that

2

It has a chilling effect.
QUESTION:

What, Mr. Barham, if the court had

3

simply held your client in contempt and fined him this

4

amount of money, and said I'm going to fine you an amount

5

equivalent to the attorneys' fees?

6

MR. BARHAM:

If you pay that into the court, I

7

only can question the amount.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BARHAM:

10

QUESTION:

But what is —
I can't question your power.
And what -- even if — what if it

11

were done as a form of civil contempt, where you would

12

presumably pay the money to the other side?

13

MR. BARHAM:

If it's under contempt, I don't

14

know that what — I'm not sure that I could agree that I

15

would, I would not have to argue against that.

16

shifting is what bothers me, because there is such a very

17

strong policy consideration, not only in Louisiana but in

18

most States against fee distribution by a court.

19

determined by either the legislation or the parties

20

themselves if there is going to be fee shifting.

QUESTION:

It is

This isn't fee shifting, as I

understand what the Fifth Circuit did here, or the

the English tradition of fee shifting.

some difference?
MR. BARHAM:

3

Don't you see

Well, it's also outcome involved

4

because only the loser is going to get this fee shift.

5

Only the loser.
QUESTION:

6

Yes, but the great majority of losers

7

won't get it, only losers who behave the way your client

8

did.

9

MR. BARHAM:

Well, but it does run counter to

that outcome look under Erie.

Why, why is it that only the loser

will ever get it?

14

MR. BARHAM:

15

QUESTION:

Don't you think that a winner, in the

I don't believe you can shift —
-- could have been so — could have

16

had such outrageous conduct that the court can — which

17

causes additional expenses to the other side, even though

18

he wins, and the court can say, you know, in the course of

19

getting there you violated the rules?

20

MR. BARHAM:

That is not the concept of the

21

equity power, the equity inherent power for shifting fees.

22

The concept is that you make whole the party who is the

23

victor, so the loser always pays, the victor pockets.

24
25

QUESTION:

But as the Chief Justice suggested,

maybe we're not talking about that power.

Maybe we're

1

talking about some different power, which is the power of

2

the court to protect itself from being imposed on by the

3

parties, to protect its processes.

4

MR. BARHAM:

If you don't use one of the rule

5

powers, which are so numerous now and cover every piece of

6

conduct — in fact despite the statement by the court, if

7

you read what he enumerates is the conduct, it could have

been sanctioned at the time under Rule 11, but —

What if Rule 11 only applies to

MR. BARHAM:

Well, almost — litigation begins,

proceeds, the discovery, everything is — was signed

Your only complaint is that it was

I'd complain about the amount.
Well then you would just complain.

But you concede that substantially

all of the conduct here could be sanctionable under Rule

All right.

extensive opinion detailing the misconduct by the attorney

concurred in, if not directed, by the client.

thought you agreed that substantially all of that conduct,

And I

I have to — I have to take back —

2

I will suggest to you why I think the court

3

thought that he could not, and that is I think there has

4

been some dispute among the circuits about just how far

Rule 11 applies in terms of signings and parties, also in

terms of, for example, in this case there was a

fabrication of a fraud, as you pointed out ahead of — in

the other argument, there is a fabrication of a fraud

pointing out that I think this Court and certainly the

That was what was applied here.

Now, I think that's unequivocal in Roadway.

is the key to the holding, that there are inherent powers

governed not by rule or statute, but by the control

12

For example, the conduct that was condemned in

Now, I think to some degree, I just want to

point out a couple of other quick points here, but I think

I will be the first to concede that Federal courts have

Now there is another power, and that is a power

Is the rule you propose that if a

this was.

me that there are two parts to that.

The question is very broadly

I wouldn't say the Court was barred from

reaching the question, based on the question that is
presented, but I think it's clear Rule 11 doesn't.

And

the reason I think it's clear is because the rule itself
expressly states it's expanding and building upon, and no
way contracting.
And it seems to me at worst the two powers are
coextensive.

And if they are, the district court and the

court of appeals acted entirely properly in placing it on
the inherent power rather than Rule 11.

If the two powers

are not coextensive, then it seems to me that the inherent
power, being broader, is necessary in the sense that this
