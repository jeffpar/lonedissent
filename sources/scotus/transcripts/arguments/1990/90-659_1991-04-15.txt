ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. MISHKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a plaintiff

11

can maintain an action under section 16(b) of the

12

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after ceasing to own any

13

securities of the issuer on whose behalf the action was

14

instituted.

15

Briefly stated, the facts are as follows.

The

16

respondent, then a shareholder of Viacom International,

17

Inc., brought this action under section 16(b) against the

18

petitioners in January of 1987.

19

International was acquired in a merger transaction in

20

which the respondent and other public shareholders of

21

International received in exchange for their shares in

22

International a combination of cash and a small amount of

23

securities in the acquiring corporation, which became the

24

parent company of Viacom International, which in turn

25

became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent.

In June of 1987 Viacom

9

I mean, as far as your legal principle

MR. MISHKIN:

Justice Scalia, that is correct.

10

I point it out because in the opinion of the court of

11

appeals below there was some suggestion that there was

12

something suspicious in the timing.

nothing suspicious in the timing.

respondent argued or alleged otherwise — that this merger

suit was filed.

In fact there was
If the Court looks to

The merger was a culmination of those

I point that out simply as a matter of fact.
The analysis of this case should begin with the

20
21

statute.

The statute says that an action may be

22

instituted by the issuer or by the owner of any security,

23

of the issuer in the name and on behalf of the issuer.

24

The statute does not state that a former owner of an issue

25

or securities can sue.

Indeed neither the SEC nor the

1

respondent now seem to be saying that a former owner can

2

sue in the first instance, although that —

3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Mishkin, in this case

4

wasn't the plaintiff an owner at the time the suit was

5

initiated?

6

MR. MISHKIN:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

So all we have to resolve is whether

it's now moot or he has lost standing?
MR. MISHKIN:

What is it?

What the Court is -- must resolve

10

is whether a former shareholder, having commenced an

11

action, loses standing when he ceases to be an owner of

12

the securities of the issuer.

13

made in this case that -- by the SEC and the respondent,

14

that a former share owner may lose standing in some cases

15

but somehow not in this case, because in this case the SEC

16

takes the position and the respondent takes the position

17

that because the shareholder, originally a shareholder of

18

the issuer, has wound up a shareholder of the parent

19

corporation, that an exception should be made to the

20

statute to cover this particular set of affairs.

The further contention is

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Mishkin --

22

QUESTION:

Well, is that strictly speaking an

23

exception to the statute?

25

profit may be instituted by the owner of any security of

Now, this suit was instituted by an owner of

MR. MISHKIN:

That's correct.

And that

distinction now seems to have become, belatedly in this

5

Court, the linchpin of the SEC's position.

party relied.

19

of mootness might come into play in appropriate cases, -but

what we're dealing with is a question of statutory

construction.

somebody could get inside the courthouse door, and

2

whatever happens to him thereafter we're going to leave up

3

to the courts to decide under constitutional mootness

standards.
What the statute says is that a shareholder

should be a shareholder of the issuer.

7

And the question is did it — means to say thereafter

8

anybody can continue suit so long as they maintain, no

9

matter how indirect, an interest.

It was very plain.

For example, suppose

No, what I think I'm saying is

But he didn't do that.
He didn't do that.

What in the statute defeats his right

to continue an action that was properly instituted?
MR. MISHKIN:

11

I think it's inherently in the

12

concept of a section 16(b) and a derivative action,

13

because the courts have said in both contexts, in section

14

16(b) and in shareholder derivative actions generally, of

15

which this is a variation, that a shareholder must be a

16

shareholder of the issuer corporation, and not a

17

shareholder of some parent or indirect subsidiary.

Well, that's what's in the 16(b)

MR. MISHKIN:

term "issuer."
QUESTION:

the suit.
MR. MISHKIN:

Well, if the -- I don't think what

the Congress intended to do was to state that a

shareholder need — his standing may be tested or need be

10

tested only at the instant the suit is filed.

11

make of the standing requirement the sort of empty

formality that the SEC claims that our position is.
QUESTION:

That would

Well, Mr. Mishkin, in diversity cases

14

do we look at diversity of the parties as of the

initiation of the lawsuit, and if it disappears later do

we say there is no standing?
MR. MISHKIN:

No, Justice O'Connor, you look at

QUESTION:

Or the amount in controversy cases?

20

MR. MISHKIN:

No, those are questions that go to

when a court's jurisdiction hatches to a lawsuit and it

22

doesn't reinvestigate its jurisdiction as a case proceeds.

3

QUESTION:

Well, it's entirely, it's entirely

4

possible that a case filed under this 16(b) section could

5

later become moot, I suppose.

6

Stevens pointed out, is whether this case has mooted out.

7

MR. MISHKIN:

So our question, as Justice

Well, I think this case is mooted

8

out insofar as the statutory words are concerned.

9

is a question of what Congress intended.

And it

We are not

10

maintaining that the plaintiff has not maintained — does

11

not have -- if it were a question of whether he had

12

constitutional standing, that he would have lost

13

constitutional standing.

14

look at the statute and you determine what it is the

15

statute intended, the sort of interest that a plaintiff

16

would have.

17

What our argument is is that you

And it seems to me that the Commission and the

18

respondent are both saying look, we recognize that the

19

word "instituted" doesn't mean that you look at it only at

20

the instant the lawsuit is brought.

21

has attempted to engage in rulemaking in this area and to

22

establish distinctions among shareholders who have lost

certain instances a shareholder who has lost his shares by

virtue of a merger continues to have standing, and certain

instances doesn't continue to have standing.

If the SEC

2

believed that the word instituted was all you needed to

3

look at, then it wouldn't have had to adopt any such

4

rules.

5

And indeed, in its 1989 rule proposal where it

6

did include a requirement that a shareholder had brought

7

the action before a merger resulted in the loss of his

8

shares, the SEC only applied those proposed rules to a

9

merger situation.

It didn't apply it to a situation where

10

there was a reverse stock split.

11

situation where a shareholder was confronted with a cash

12

tender offer that would be followed by a back end merger,

13

and said if he tendered in the first stage he wouldn't

14

lose standing.

15

It didn't apply it to a

As far as I can understand the Commission's

16

position he would lose standing.

17

between a shareholder who tenders in the first step and a

18

shareholder who accepts the merger price?

19

is there between a shareholder who excepts an exchange

20

offer, which is not exempted by their proposed rule?

21

think that the Commission has clearly and implicitly

22

accepted the idea that this statute is not to be looked at

after filing his complaint and says --

MR. MISHKIN:

Well, I think that the Commission

6

actually identified a statute which, somehow, inexplicably

7

to me, they cited it in their favor which indicated the

8

statute provided that a lawsuit could be instituted

9

against a certain — Secretary of a Government agency, and

10

went on to provide that even if that, the identity of that

11

Secretary changed, the action could be maintained.

12

seems to me that Congress was recognizing that if the word

13

"instituted" meant, in that instance, that you looked at

14

the lawsuit, at the inception of it and forget about what

15

happens thereafter, they would not have adopted any

16

further terminology.

It

I think what the Congress is doing where it uses

17
18

the word "instituted," and it does so in other instances,

19

I think in section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act

20

which the Court had before it in the Daily Income Fund

21

against Fox case was another such example, although

22

litigation has not arisen under it that raises this

question.

incrementally the value of his own shares?
MR. MISHKIN:

That was the intention that the

Congress had in mind by vesting a plaintiff with standing
to bring an action.
that clear.

And the legislative history makes

There are repeated references to the fact

that a shareholder or a security owner is given standing
to maintain the action because indeed that shareholder has
a financial interest in achieving a result, even if it's
an indirect financial interest as a shareholder of the
company.
So the idea that somebody should be a stranger
to the corporation and be permitted to proceed simply
because he was originally a shareholder and thereafter
ceased to be one is foreign to this statute.
QUESTION:

But what's the incentive?

It doesn't

seem to me like there would be much incentive to a small
shareholder.

Do you get attorneys' fees?

MR. MISHKIN:

The way I think the statute has

operated or worked out over the years in practice, most
shareholders indeed have the interest of their lawyers.

I

think in this instance we have such a circumstance, where
in fact a shareholder brought a lawsuit after the court
held that the shareholder had no standing.

He went out at

the recommendation or suggestion of his lawyer and bought
some notes or some junk bonds that happened to be

QUESTION:

But how does the lawyer benefit if

the statute doesn't provide for attorneys' fees?
MR. MISHKIN:

5

Well, the courts regularly award

6

lawyers — plaintiffs' lawyers attorneys' fees in these

7

circumstances.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MISHKIN:

Under the common fund theory?
Yes.

Yes.

And clearly, as a

10

practical matter in most of these cases the principal

11

interest is that of an attorney, not of a shareholder.

12

But the statute itself when it was constructed, and it

13

was, it is a statute, let us all recognize, is a statute

14

that is devoted to certain formal requirements.

15

This Court has recognized the statute is a

16

strict liability statute, that it sometimes operates

17

harshly.

19

whether the defendant did abuse or use inside information.

20

It catches people who are not in fact insiders, never have

been, such as my clients, in a particular company, because

22

they meet a certain statutory threshold that is

23

arbitrarily fixed.

believe was a client of Lehman Brothers, and a partner, a

the Court took into account that this statute is a

inflexible statute that imposes requirements that are not

defendants or to particular plaintiffs.

15

Similar approaches have been taken by the Court

16

in every case that this Court has had, I believe,

involving section 16(b).

imposes rather strict requirements and harsh requirements,

sometimes unjust, and we're going to read the words not in

to say out of order or out of sequence is that my opponent

mentioned at least five or more times congressional

intent.

21

manifest from the face of section 16(b)

22

the intent of Congress to confer as broad standing upon a

24

For example, the Congress said that any owner of a

could sue under 16(b), which is much broader than the

2

ordinary derivative action where one has to own stock of

3

the company in question.

4

Second, the Congress provided —

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but it doesn't say any owner of

any security of a parent of the issuer, which could have

been a little broader.

Well — never mind.
So, as I said, it's palpable that

didn't confine standing to stock owners.

18

requirement under 16(b) that the security owner owned a

19

security contemporaneously at the time of the violation.

20

And that is another rule in ordinary derivative actions

21

which is not the case in 16(b).

22

Also there is no

Thirdly, Congress made it clear in 16(b) that

23

the shareholder is not bound by the business judgment of

24

the issuer not to sue, which of course is not the

25

situation in ordinary derivative actions.

So, my submission to the Court is it's as if

1
2

Congress had explicitly written in 16(b) that we want

3

shareholder standing to be as broad as possible, and

4

further that if Congress had been presented by this case

when it enacted the statute it would surely have opted for

6

standing.

7

Now, to return to the formal argument, the facts

8

in this case are quite simple.

9

the stock of the issuer at the time he commenced this

10

16(b) action, so that he satisfied the requirement of

11

16(b) that he be the owner of any security issuer at the

12

time of institution of suit.

13

First, the plaintiff owned

Secondly, in the merger by which the issuer

14

became the wholly owned subsidiary of another company,

15

that is the parent company, the plaintiff received stock

16

as a result of the merger in the parent company, so that

17

the plaintiff has a continuing financial interest to

18

maintain a 16(b) action in this case.

19

And further, since plaintiff's 16(b) action had

20

been commenced prior to the merger and was pending at the

21

time of the merger, this case presents the possible danger

22

of a restructuring intentionally designed to defeat

23

section 16(b).

MR. MALCHMAN:

QUESTION:

Well --

Congress felt it necessary not to

10

stop by just saying suit may be instituted by the issuer,

11

which it could have said.

12

would be here arguing well, the stockholder of the issuer

13

can sue by way of a derivative action.

14

In which case, I suppose you

But Congress didn't think that implication was

15

enough, and therefore it went on to say not only the

16

issuer, but the owner of any security of the issuer.

17

I would have assumed if it wanted to go one step further

18

it would have repeated that step again, or the owner of

19

any security of the parent of an issuer. ,

MR. MALCHMAN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. DOTY

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Malchman.

10

ON BEHALF OF THE SEC,

11

AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS
MR. DOTY:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

14

The Securities and Exchange Commission believes

15

that the guiding principle for determining standing under

16

section 16(b) of the Exchange Act resides in the plain

17

language of the statute and in Congress' purpose in

18

enacting section 16(b) to create an express private right

19

of action.

20

position first that the plain language of section 16(b)

21

directs the maintenance of standing here as that language

As to this statute, it is the Commission's

6

22

is unambiguous in its grant of standing to institute suit

23

to a broad class of security holders.

24

language of section 16(b) or anywhere else in any other

25

provision of the Exchange Act limits that grant of

standing or permits a gloss of a continuous ownership

requirement on the statute.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Doty, do you speak just for the

4

SEC here or do you speak for the Government more

5

generally?

6

position with respect to all statutes that, when they say

7

somebody can institute suits with a certain characteristic

8

they can continue it, whether they retain that

9

characteristic or not?

10

Is the Government willing to accept that

MR. DOTY:

Justice Scalia, I believe that in the

11

context of this statute my statement as to the breadth of

12

the grant of standing in this statutory context is one

13

which the Government shares.

14

the Government recognize that, -at some point in the

15

determination of an interest in a lawsuit, article III

16

considerations do arise, but we in the Government, in the

17

Solicitor's General office, share the view that in this

18

case plaintiff Mendell's continuing economic interest in

19

the issuer and in the lawsuit which the security in its

20

parent represents is entirely sufficient for purposes of

21

article Ills

MR. DOTY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

For example, is the Government

willing to accept that under the judicial review provision

says any person aggrieved by any final order of the

authority may institute an action for judicial review,

7

that that person, even if the person later does not meet

8

the aggrieved by any final order requirement which is

9

somewhat above the article III minimum, that person may

10

continue to maintain the suit nonetheless?
MR. DOTY:

contexts.

We would not want to purport to be representing

QUESTION:

But plain language is plain language.

16

MR. DOTY:

Plain language being plain language

here, we rest strongly on the notion, or on the clear

18

language of the statute that one who institutes the suit

19

MR. DOTY:

Well, Your Honor, let me say this.

8

This is a statute which, if the structure and the

9

procedures of the statute are carefully examined, it is

10

quite clear that Congress intended to legislate the

11

elements of a private cause of action, including the

12

procedures whereby a security holder went about getting

that lawsuit before the courts.

for the purposes of 16(b), Mr. Chief Justice, that is
correct.

The defendants in this case are arguing that

3

their right of continuous ownership, or this gloss of

4

continuous ownership, is implicit in the statute.

5

think that one does not have — one need not look to this

6

implicit gloss in the statute, that the statute's policy

7

is clear that it intended to authorize the instituting of

suits by one who was an owner of a security —
QUESTION:

9

And Congress was indifferent to what

10

the plaintiff did with the security after he instituted

11

the suit?

12

MR. DOTY:

I think certainly Congress recognized

13

that the policing power, the enforcement policy of the

14

statute overcame what Mr. Mishkin has attempted to

15

characterize as a common sense concern here.

16

Congress was comfortable with the notion that article III

17

concepts of continuing interest in the outcome of

18

litigation and the ability to vigorously advocate a

19

position on behalf of a representation undertaken would be

20

sufficient for the purposes of this statute.

of insider trading here in which the purpose was to get

these suits brought and litigated.

MR. DOTY:

It is possible that it is not moot.

It is -- there are facts which could be developed which

QUESTION:

We would have to presumably go

12

suit, and after that any interest at all that possibly

meets article III standing is going to be enough.

it's possible to write a statute that way, but it seems

15

like a very strange statute to me.

MR. DOTY:

All you need is the

But, Justice Scalia, Congress has in

potential, the possibility for abuse in the misuse of

inside information, and that to do that it has sought to

20

confer standing on security holders to bring the lawsuits.

hypothetical, the cases that could arise under this

The mootness issue does arise from time to time,
