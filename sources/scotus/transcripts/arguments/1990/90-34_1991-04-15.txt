ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PARE:

However,

The district

1

based on this Court's 1855 decision in Minturn v. Maynard.

2

Minturn stands for a per se rule that the services

3

provided by general agents are outside admiralty

4

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Pare, before you go any further,

6

do you -- what do we have before us here?

7

whether there is admiralty jurisdiction or the question

8

whether there is an admiralty lien, or both, or is the one

9

automatically subsumed within the other?
MR. PARE:

10

11

Your Honor, the primary question is

whether there is admiralty jurisdiction.

12

QUESTION:

The question

The suit —

Can I find that there is admiralty

13

jurisdiction and say that I don't know whether there's a

14

lien or not?

15

Is that possible?

MR. PARE:

It is possible to find that, Your

16

Honor.

However the evidence on this subject, as we will

17

get to later, is crystal clear that on the facts of this

18

case Exxon should be, but for the Minturn rule, entitled

19

to a lien.

20

in the legal thinking —

Since Minturn there has been a transformation

QUESTION:

21

Well, will there be cases in which

22

there is admiralty jurisdiction but no lien when the cause

23

of action is to recover for the furnishing of money or

24

supplies?

25

MR. PARE:

For the furnishing of —

QUESTION :

Of money or supplies.

2

MR. PARE:

There, in such cases there will be,

3

presuming the necessary ingredient is admiralty

4

jurisdiction, but whether there is a lien will depend

5

perhaps on, to some extent on the status of the party

6

providing the lien involved.

7

clause in the contract, such as there is in this case,

8

then clearly under the existing law that party should be

9

entitled to a lien.

10

But if there is a particular

Not all admiralty jurisdiction cases

give rise to a lien.
QUESTION:

11

No, because there are admiralty

12

collision cases, et cetera.

13

which there are suit brought for recovery of monies on

14

account of monies or supplies advanced to the shipper

15

where there will be admiralty jurisdiction but no lien?

16

MR. PARE:

But will there be cases in

Your Honor, I could certainly

17

conceive of — I would believe that in the area of

18

physical supplies of necessaries to vessels, in most cases

19

that I can conceive of right now that should probably give

20

rise to a lien.

21

QUESTION:

Of course they could recite in the

22

contract I am relying exclusively upon the solvency of the

23

owner.

24

wouldn't be an implied lien, right?

25

If they recited that in the contract there

MR. PARE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Is it a correct -- is it a correct

statement of the law to say that not every maritime

11

contract action gives right -- gives rise to a maritime

Absolutely, Your Honor.

to maritime commerce.

4

commentators and the courts, including the Second Circuit,

5

have urged that this Court reject the Minturn rule.

6

The Minturn rule excludes the services

It is for that reason that the

Respondent argues that to reject the Minturn

7

rule will open up the Federal courts to suits by all

agents of all types.

9

First, Minturn itself is a discrete rule.

We submit that this is incorrect.
As the

10

commentators, and I make particular reference to Gilmore

11

and Black at pages 22 and 29 of their treatise, have

12

indicated that in other areas of jurisdictional -- in

other jurisdictional areas the jurisdiction is fairly well

defined.

19

Bodena, which is found at 829 F.2d 293, specifically at

20

page 302, that court has offered a jurisdictional

21

rationale which seems to make sense and is consistent with

22

the commentators.

QUESTION:

MR. PARE:

Your Honor

2

QUESTION:

It seems to have been employed quite

3

extensively.

4

MR. PARE:

I think a redefined preliminary

5

contract rule, as apparently exists in Bodena, would be an

6

acceptable way to delimit admiralty jurisdiction.

7

Specifically in the Bodena case there was an agent

8

involved. That was a freight forwarding agent.

9

freight forwarding agent performed certain services.

The

10

Specifically he arranged and he prepared bills of lading.

11

Under the old preliminary contract rule such services

12

would be considered preliminary because they were

13

preliminary to the actual marine contract, i.e. the bill

14

of lading.

15

and it held that the services provided by the freight

16

forwarding agent were themselves, quote,

17

voyage," unquote, and on that basis held that those

18

services were not preliminary services.

19

The Bodena court, however, did not so hold,

QUESTION:

"essential to the

Well, that's kind of a modification,

20

is it, of that preliminary contract rule.

Now here you

21

have a contract to make some phone calls to provide fuel

in bunkers.

suppose?

1

recognized, you don't look to what is going on physically

2

on the vessel but you look at the essence of the

3

transaction in a maritime contract.

4

here was that Exxon was not only arranging under its

5

contracts, but it was advancing its credit and it was

6

paying for the fuel.

7

physical delivery never would have taken place.

8

And what was going on

Without Exxon's involvement that

Perhaps more importantly, to answer Your Honor's

9

question, the key here should be that what is being done

10

is there is a performance of a service that is essential

11

to the operation of the voyage.

12

be the key to any jurisdictional rationale.

13

QUESTION:

And that, I think, would

Well, I wanted to ask you, you want

14

the Court to overrule Minturn, but I'm curious exactly

15

what rule you would have us adopt?

little hard to understand what your proposal is.

That is not

what we are saying with respect to other agents.

2

have a traditional maritime agent, such as a freight

3

forwarder, who performs services which are essential to

the operation of the voyage, not perhaps the general

such services should be considered within admiralty

MR. PARE:

— as we have indicated in our brief.

19

To answer your, Your Honor's question

20

specifically, certainly, if I may step back and take the

21

cargo setting, if somebody performs services that lead to

22

cargo being put on board the vessel the argument would

perhaps be the same, that the cargo is the service.

24

would submit that the physical operation of the vessel is

on, and you could make a rational distinction and keep

2

both cargo, the cargo broker and the passenger or the

3

reservation people out, but yet keep people who run the

4

vessel, people who provide fuel, people who provide the

5

crew, people who provide what is necessary for

6

navigational activity in.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pare, you say some agents

8

would be kept out by your rule, the general agent would be

9

put in.

10
11

What's the difference between the general agent

and the freight forwarder and the passenger agent?
MR. PARE:

Well, Your Honor, it's almost by

12

definition that a general agent performs key services on

13

behalf of the vessel.

14

the general agent should be in because he is performing

15

services which are essential to the voyage.

16

QUESTION:

And it's almost by definition that

Well, is that actually how a general

17

agent is defined, is that he performs services that are

18

essential to the voyage?

19

of the two things?

Or is that simply your equation

20

MR. PARE:

There are several definitions of what

21

a general agent is.

22

court and the court of appeals agreed the definition

23

should really key off continuity of service.

I believe in this case the district

24

So to answer Your Honor's question, there may

25

conceivably be some situations in which a general agent

1

does not provide services that are critical to the

2

operation of the voyage, but right now I cannot conceive

3

of any such situations.

4

QUESTION;

If the general agent in a particular

5

case did not provide services that were essential to the

6

operation of the voyage, would that part of the general

7

agent's services nonetheless be subject to admiralty

8

jurisdiction?

9
10
11

MR. PARE;

It would depend on what they were,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

So the fact you have a contract of

12

general agency doesn't get you an admiralty jurisdiction

13

automatically?

14

to be provided?

15

It depends on the nature of the services

MR. PARE:

I would think so, but certainly in

16

the normal course of the way the steamship business runs,

17

as I say, I cannot conceive of a situation where a general

18

agent would be performing services which were not

19

essential to the voyage.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question, Mr Pare?

In your view was Exxon a general agent?
MR. PARE:

Well, tha.t certainly was something

23

that we opposed at the court of appeals level, but lost,

24

and we take that finding for what it is.

25

QUESTION:

So all the talk about general agents

1

doesn't really decide this case if Exxon is not a general

2

agent?
MR. PARE:

3

No, Your Honor, but the corollary or

4

the other part of what we're arguing here is really one

5

and the same, because if -- certainly Exxon is performing

6

an essential maritime service.

7

QUESTION:

And --

Well, I can understand an argument

8

that an agent that performs -- services essential to the

9

voyage be the kind of relationship that supports admiralty

10

jurisdiction.

11

about the status of general agents, and why that is

12

relevant to this particular case.

13

I'm a little puzzled about all the argument

MR. PARE:

Well, simply because the finding, the

14

final finding in this case, is that Exxon was a general

15

agent.

16

QUESTION:

Was a general agent?

17

MR. PARE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Holding of Minturn that general

agents are per se excluded from admiralty jurisdiction.

appeals found, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

Well, do you agree with that?

3

MR. PARE:

Well, if you take the proposition

4

that a general agent is one who provides continuity of

5

service, which is what the restatement on agency provides,

6

then we are a general agent and we are therefore covered

7

by the Minturn rule.

8

9
10
11
12

13

QUESTION:

You couldn't make the argument that

in Minturn there was a wide variety of services, and here
just the supply of fuel?
MR. PARE:

We made that argument in the court of

appeals and we lost.
QUESTION:

The court of appeals really thought

14

that if you supplied napkins to the ship regularly for 20

15

years you become a general agent?

16

continuity?

17

Is that it, just

It doesn't matter subject matter at all?

MR. PARE:

Well, I perhaps would be not speaking

18

fairly about the court of appeals if I were to say that

19

they would agree with that.

20

probably still be looking for some finding of an essential

21

marine supply.

22

Minturn, Peralta, Binnings-type cases there is no question

23

about the fact that a general agent provides key maritime

24

services, and not simply napkins.

a case in the general agency setting.

QUESTION:

1

Under Minturn we know that general

2

agents are excluded from admiralty jurisdiction.

3

follow a fortiori from that case that freight forwarders

4

and passenger agents are also excluded from admiralty

5

jurisdiction?

6

MR. PARE:

Does it

It does not follow a fortiori.

And

7

in fact it is only by virtue of the fact in Second

8

Circuit, that the Second Circuit has fused the general

9

agency rule with the preliminary contract rule, that they

10

have cited cases like Minturn in nongeneral agency cases.
QUESTION:

11

So your position would be that you're

12

not asking us to move admiralty jurisdiction outward all

13

the way in a sense?

14

MR. PARE:

Not at all, Your Honor.

We're only

15

asking that you overrule the per se arbitrary rule in

16

Minturn.

17

greater boundaries for admiralty jurisdiction because the

18

rule simply would be that any services that are performed

19

by a traditional maritime agent that are essential to the

20

operation of the voyage would be entitled to admiralty

21

jurisdiction..

22

And there is no danger there in setting any

QUESTION:

The thing that bothers me is I don't

23

understand, you are not arguing that even if Minturn

24

continues to state the correct rule for general agents,

25

you should nevertheless win because you're the kind of

1

agent that provided essential services and therefore

2

should support admiralty jurisdiction?
MR. PARE:

3

If it were still within our power to

4

argue that we weren't a general agent we would certainly

5

argue that in the alternative.
QUESTION:

6

7

You think you're beaten by

the findings of the lower court on that?
MR. PARE:

8

9

I see.

Yes, Your Honor.

We certainly have

not urged those arguments here.
The logical corollary to this rule would be that

10
11

any agent in the maritime area who provides essential

12

maritime services and who advances his credit and pays for

13

them is entitled to a lien.

consistent with the goal of admiralty jurisdiction, which

18

is the protection and the promotion of maritime commerce,

19

and not the lining up of contracts along a chain.

That is consistent with the

In this case Exxon, but for Minturn, should have

a lien.

That is true under the decisions in the Golden

22

Gate and it is also true by virtue of the fact that Exxon

advanced its credit under Panamanian Flag Barge.

should be no remaining issue before this Court.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Second Circuit disposed of this case its per

22

23

obligations enforceable within the admiralty jurisdiction.

As the briefs demonstrate, that rule has been widely

Perhaps even more important, the rule produces

very anomalous results.

QUESTION:

So it's the intervention of an agent,

basically.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

That's correct.

The Second

8

special agent, a general agent, or an agent under a so-

9

called managing agreement.

That is true, again, I'm

In the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits a general agent
