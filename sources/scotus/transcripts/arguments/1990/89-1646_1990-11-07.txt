ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In this case the respondents brought an action

11

against Dr. William Marshall, a U.S. Army physician,

12

alleging malpractice occurring while Dr. Marshall was

13

stationed overseas in Italy.

14

substitute the United States as defendant, because Dr.

15

Marshall was acting in the scope of his employment at the

16

time of the acts complained of, and moved to dismiss the

17

action because under an exception to the Tort Claims Act

18

for claims arising in a foreign country, recovery could

19

not be had against the United States.

20

The Government moved to

The motions were granted by the district court,

21

and on appeal, the court of appeals reversed, holding that

22

the provision requiring substitution of the United States

23

and precluding an action against the individual did not

24

apply when an exception to the Tort Claims Act barred

25

recovery against the United States.

Because of a conflict

among the circuits, the case was brought here for review.
QUESTION:

2

Well, now, Mr. Shapiro, the

3

Government did not bring here the question about the

4

Gonzalez Act, and —

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

6

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That strikes me as a little unusual.

7

It's very difficult to know how the statutory scheme fits

8

together if you don't know the meaning of the Gonzalez

9

Act.

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the meaning of the Gonzalez

11

Act is very much part of the case, Your Honor.

12

question -- we think the broad question whether this

13

action precluded — is precluded by the Tort Reform Act of

14

1980 -- 1988 fairly does embrace the Gonzalez Act issue.

15

In any event, the respondents have relied entirely on the

16

Gonzalez Act as a basis for affirming the judgment below.

17

And we agree that —

18
19

QUESTION:

So you think we do have to get into

it, and understand at least what the Gonzalez Act means?

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

21

QUESTION:

22

The

Yes, Your Honor.

Are you going to tell us what you

think it means?

MR. SHAPIRO:

MR. SHAPIRO:

Because it's a mystery to me.
I'm going to try.

We do believe that the case presents two very

1
2

closely related questions.

One is whether the Tort Reform

3

Act of 1988 in its own terms applies to require

4

substitution of the United States and precludes an action

5

against Dr. Marshall in the circumstances of this case.

6

We submit, in disagreement with the court below, that it

7

plainly does, both in the light of the language of the

8

statute, its clearly expressed purpose, and its history.

9

The second question in the case, which is the

10

question you, Justice O'Connor, referred to, is whether

11

the Gonzalez Act of 1976 precludes the application of the

12

reform act in this case.

13

not.

14

the Gonzalez Act and the broad protection afforded by the

15

Reform Act, and that in the event of any conflict the

16

provisions of the Reform Act are required to --

17
18
19

Our position is that it does

That there is no conflict between the provisions of

QUESTION:

Does the Gonzalez Act grant any

affirmative right to sue the physician?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

And

20

I think that's a critical point of disagreement between us

21

and the respondents.

22

throughout their brief a point which was not at all the

23

basis of the decision below, and that is that they are

24

pursuing a remedy under the Gonzalez Act.

25

That was evident from their complaint.

The respondents attempt to suggest

They are not.

The basis of their

assertion of Federal jurisdiction was diversity of

citizenship.

3

Italian law, under California law, and under something

4

described as general American law, which perhaps was an

5

effort to resuscitate Swift against Tyson, but was clearly

6

not a reference to the Gonzalez Act.

7

They allege malpractice by the doctor under

What the Gonzalez Act does, we submit, is to

8

protect physicians in two ways.

First and most

significantly, it protects physicians against suit by —

requiring the substitution of the United States as a

defendant.

ago that that preclusion, that protection, applied under

13

the circumstances of this case.

And indeed, the Fifth Circuit held a few years

But that doesn't apply if the tort

occurs outside the United States?

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, the Gonzalez Act

preclusion of that act applies in the circumstances of

Act just doesn't apply if the tort occurs outside the

United States?

-- that is, we do not challenge the holding of the court

2

below that the Gonzalez Act does not preclude the action

against the doctor in this case, the Gonzalez Act itself.

4

The other —

5
6

QUESTION:

But it doesn't give a cause of

action?

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct.

That is correct.

8

The other form of protection that was given to doctors and

9

related medical and dental personnel under the Gonzalez

10

Act was to authorize indemnification in situations where

11

the doctors might be held liable under some other law.

12

For example, if they were sued in a foreign country and

13

held liable under foreign law, and perhaps if they were

14

sued in other situations where the Tort Claims Act was not

15

available.

16

But the only function of the Gonzalez Act,

17

subsection (f), we submit, was to authorize

18

indemnification of doctors.

19

action against them.

It did not authorize a cause of

20

action against them.

And that is why, in our view, there

21

is —

22

QUESTION:

It did not create a cause of

But it is true, is it not, Mr.

23

Shapiro, that it would have permitted a cause of action

24

against the doctor on these very facts?

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

It would not have precluded it.

where the Tort Claims Act remedy is relevant.
To return, if I may for a minute, I would like

to return to this also, but to return for a minute to the

broader question in this case on which there is this

conflict among the circuits.

the United States and precludes the action against the

individual.

9

conceded that point in their brief.

We submit that the Reform

Indeed the respondents appear to have
They do not pursue

10

it.

They rely only on the argument that the -- whatever

11

action was available under the Gonzalez Act is preferred

12

-- is preserved.

13

In our view that concession is correct.

We

14

think there is no question under the text of the Reform

15

Act that substitution of the United States is required

16

here, and that the action against Dr. Marshall is

17

precluded.

18

To begin with the text of the Reform Act, it

19

starts in what is now subsection (b)(1) of section 2679,

20

by saying that the remedy against the United States

21

provided by 1346(b) is exclusive of any other civil action

22

23

QUESTION:

Well, the problem with that is that

24

the Federal Tort Claims Act doesn't apply to torts

overseas.

is it

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, we don't believe —

— that the Reform Act affects this?

That's, I guess, one of the concerns of the Ninth Circuit.
MR. SHAPIRO:

5

Well, the Ninth — the Ninth

6

Circuit did certainly address that question squarely, but

7

we think it didn't read the act as a whole, or — nor did

8

it focus on the legislative findings.

9

with what is now 2679(b)(1).

That is, you start

We concede that that section

10

standing alone is capable of two different readings,

11

although we contend the far more plausible reading is that

12

you have to take the Tort Claims Act remedy with its

13

exceptions and limitations.

14

is confirmed beyond any doubt first by subsection (b)(4),

which is a part of the same statute, and which says that

scope of his employment.

States shall proceed and shall be subject to the

19

limitations and exceptions applicable to those sections.

(b)(4) confirms the natural reading of (b)(1) that the

limitations and exceptions of the act itself, including

8

those in 2680.

history.

11

"Any claim against the Government that is precluded by the

12

exceptions in 2680 is also precluded against an employee,

13

or his or her estate."

14

is consistent with the legislative findings that were made

15

in the Reform Act, that were incorporated in the act in

16

section 2.

17

Court's decision in Westfall against Erwin, which had —

18

just previously been announced, seriously eroded the

19

common law immunity previously available to -- Federal

20

employees.

21

The House Committee report said, and I quote,

We also believe that that reading

Those findings start by suggesting that this

In the view of Congress, the erosion of that

22

immunity had created an immediate crisis, and I am reading

23

again from the findings "involving the prospect of

24

liability and the threat of protracted litigation."

25

Justice Stevens, to return to an earlier question of
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(800) FOR DEPO

So,

yours, Congress was concerned not only with the threat of
liability, but with the threat of protracted personal tort
litigation for the entire Federal work force.

And

Congress does not suggest in doing that that the employees
whose conduct falls within the exceptions of section 2680
are in any sense different from Federal employees whose
conduct is subject to, not only to suit under the Tort
Claims Act, but to recovery as well.

And the findings go

on to say that granting broad protection to individual
employees is necessary to the morale and well-being of the
Federal work force.
I should emphasize, if I may, that the
respondents at the end of their brief have seriously
overstated the consequences of the position that the
Government is urging here.

They suggest that the effect

is to — really is to leave the respondents without any
remedy whatever.

It is true that our position is that

respondents cannot recover either under Federal or State
law in court for the wrongs they allege.
But they do have a remedy, they did at the time,
and they still do, under the Military Claims Act, 10
U.S.C. Section 2733.

Millions of dollars are paid every

year under that statute on the basis of claims of
malpractice in situations where the recovery is not
available under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

It is also

1

true that under a program called the Civilian Health and

2

Military Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, a

3

substantial percentage of the child's care, costs of

4

medical care, are covered until the child is 21, and if

the child is severely handicapped, then for the rest of

their life.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, those were all in effect

at the time the Gonzalez Act was applied, weren't they?

Adopted?
MR. SHAPIRO:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm not quite

11

sure of the timing, but I think that they were.

13

to provide a remedy for individuals.

That was —

No, it's pretended to protect the

complete protection to the doctors, but it preserved the

21

This returns, and I think it's

remedy.

QUESTION:

Well, it's critical for your reading

2

of the savings clause about no violation of the statute.

3

That's — I understand, I understand your argument there.

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

And literally you perhaps have the

6

better of it, but one can assume that perhaps there is

7

some legislative history suggesting Congress did not

8

intend to take away, except for those created by the

9

Westfall case, what had thought to be other Tort Claim Act

10

-- other statutory remedies.

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

12

QUESTION:

There is an indication —

And let me ask you one other thing,

13

because you might want to address them both together.

14

it correct that there is an absence in the legislative

15

history of the Reform Act of any specific consideration of

16

medical malpractice claims?

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

Is

The only references, I believe, in

18

the legislative history to medical malpractice are

19

references to the Gonzalez Act as an example of situations

20

in which actions are precluded, and a reference to the

21

Powers case, which is very much like this case, in which

22

the Fifth Circuit held that an action of this type was

23

precluded by the Gonzalez Act itself.

discussion of malpractice.

concerned about all potential tort liability of all

2

Federal employees, and of course, there is no question at

3

all that a great many malpractice claims are within the

scope of the Reform Act.

5

malpractice claims are.

And it's our contention that all

With respect to the focus of the Gonzalez Act,

7

we do believe, as I think you agree, that the purpose of

8

the Gonzalez Act was to protect physicians, that the --

and related medical personnel.

That the primary means for

10

affording that protection was to preclude suit against

11

them as individuals and to require suit against the United

12

States.

itself or its history to what extent that preclusion was

total.

It is not clear from either the text of the act

And every court that faced that question of the

QUESTION:

Well, it is clear.

I mean this much

20

at least is clear, is if there's no remedy under the

Federal Tort Claims Act, then the case would be remanded

That's clear, isn't it?

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

I don't believe so.

Oh, I'm sorry.
There's a provision of the old

5

Drivers Act, which was very similar to the remand

6

provision of this act, which was interpreted by the courts

7

to apply only when it was determined that the employee was

not acting within the scope of his employment.

Yes, but this remand provision refers

to the absence of a remedy.

provisions, it was held under the Drivers Act by several

21

courts that the phrase the absence of a remedy referred to

22

the availability under 1346 of a suit against the United

23

States and not to the possibility that there might be

24

internal exceptions within the act itself.

implicit in your earlier question, the issue whether the

broad scope of the Reform Act is in any way limited by the

Gonzalez Act, we think is illuminated by the fact that the

7

Reform Act itself contains two very specific exceptions in

8

subsection (b)(2):

an action may be brought against an

10

action which, of course, is not this case, or may be

brought against an individual for a violation of the

statute of the United States.

I don't want to rehearse my earlier effort to

answer Justice O'Connor, but we do think it's clear that

15

this action against Dr. Marshall is not an action for a

16

violation of the statute of the United States.

17

complaint that was filed in the case clearly did not

18

regard it as such.

19

Now this Court has said in Andrews against

20

Glover and a number of other cases that when there is a

21

specific enumerated exception in an act, this Court should

22

be very reluctant to apply an additional exception in the

23

absence of very clear legislative intent.

24

there is no such legislative intent, either clear or

cloudy in this case.

We submit that

1

Now, the respondents try to answer that by

2

invoking another doctrine of statutory construction, the

3

doctrine involving a presumption against implied repeals.

4

We have attempted, I think, already to explain why in our

5

view there is no implied repeal in this case.

6

there still room for the Gonzalez Act itself to operate,

7

but the Gonzalez Act itself simply authorized

8

indemnification of a physician when in fact a physician

9

was held liable under the provisions of some other law.

10

So that if the other law under which a doctor might be

11

held liable prevents the suit against the doctor, that

12

simply reduces the need for indemnification.

13

in our view, in any way repeal the statute.

Not only is

It does not,

14

We do, however, go on in our brief, and I would

15

like to underscore that to the extent this Court believes

16

there is any tension or conflict between that provision of

17

the Gonzalez Act and the broad scope of the Reform Act,

18

that this case, like the case of Gordon against the New

19

York Stock Exchange and other cases, is a case where the

20

later statute must be given precedence if it's to be given

21

its full scope.

22

Congress intended to protect Federal employees not only

23

from liability but from the threat of protracted

24

litigation.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. OLENIEWSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We believe that the concessions made by the

13

Government in this case are critical to the resolution of

14

this case, and primarily those concessions deal with the

15

Gonzalez Act.

17

question was, one, whether a military doctor who is

18

working in a foreign country is immune under the Gonzalez

19

Act from suits for medical malpractice.

that situation said that the doctor was not so immune and

21

could be sued, regardless where the suit was brought.

13

this case involved a claim that arose in a foreign

country, and because it was different than all the other

exceptions contained under 2680.

16

pointed out earlier, and as the legislative history has

17

pointed out in the Gonzalez Act, Congress recognized that

18

they could not legislate and they could not impose their

laws on the sovereign of another country.

country.

it gets back now to the concessions of what the Government

has conceded.

Now, Newman v. Soballe clearly stated, and again

Newman v. Soballe said that a military

doctor is protected by the Gonzalez Act and is therefore

11

not among those Federal employees affected by the Westfall

decision or the Reform Act.

Act conveys a cause of action on a plaintiff who has been

allegedly injured by a Federal doctor?

MR. OLENIEWSKI:

I prefer to refer to it as a

17

remedy, Your Honor, but I would also agree that a cause of

18

action would be an acceptable synonym.

19

although the Government is arguing here today that the

20

Gonzalez Act does not provide a remedy, in their petition

1

Westfall legislation was enacted, the Gonzalez Act did

2

permit, under 1089(f), a doctor to be indemnified, which

3

obviously meant, according to the Ninth Circuit and the

4

Eleventh Circuit, that he could be sued in his individual

5

capacity.

6

But before the Newman decision, the Government

7

relied upon cases like Powers v. Schultz, and in those

8

cases they were making the same argument that they're

9

making now.

And the argument there was that there was

10

only a remedy if you could be sued in a foreign country.

11

That was rejected by Newman, that was rejected by Smith,

12

and the Westfall legislation doesn't in any way indicate

13

that those interpretations should be changed.

14

In the case of Powers v. Schultz, when the

15

Government won that decision, the plaintiff was dismissed

16

from court and there was no remedy for that plaintiff.

17

Under Newman and under Smith, because the doctor was

18

allowed to be sued in his individual capacity, it allowed

19

a suit to proceed against the doctor and for a potential

20

remedy against the doctor.

21

We believe that there is sufficient rationale in

22

the holding of the Smith case, and particularly as it

23

applies to adopting the holding in Newman v. Soballe, that

24

the Gonzalez Act is still a viable statute, and as a

25

viable statute, a remedy is available against the doctor

Other than the Gonzalez Act and

the VA statute and a couple of the other piecemeal

statutes providing for medical doctors' immunization,

an intentional tort under either the Drivers Act or the

QUESTION:

10

I suppose if we, if we accept the

Government's position here, a suit against the doctor for

an intentional tort would also be barred, if the Gonzalez

MR. OLENIEWSKI:

I would think, to carry their

logic, it would have to be.

MR. OLENIEWSKI:

Yeah.
Because they are picking and

18

choosing those provisions of the Gonzalez Act that they

believe have been repealed.

QUESTION:

Well, then — and if the statute

applies to bar any action except under the Reform Act,
that would mean an intentional tort action would be
barred, I would think -MR. OLENIEWSKI:

Yes.

I think there could be an

argument made that a doctor could no longer — or that
1089(e), which provides for an intentional tort to be
brought against the United States, that an argument can be
made that that is no longer in existence.

I don't think

that's the case, because I think it's clear from the
legislative history and the way that Congress cited the
Gonzalez Act that they were satisfied with the Gonzalez
Act.
QUESTION:

What is your response here to Mr.

Shapiro's argument based on 2679(d)(4) to the effect that,
in the provision there, that once there has been a scope
certification and a substitution of the United States, the
action proceeds subject to the limitations and exceptions
applicable to those actions?

His argument is that there

would be no utility in that reference to subject to
limitations and exceptions if remedy were to be -- were to
be limited to cases in which recovery is possible.
MR. OLENIEWSKI:

Justice Souter, prior to

enactment of the Reform Act, the Gonzalez Act essentially
carried those same provisions.

But because the Gonzalez

2

certain specified situations for military doctors.

our contention that Gonzalez Act is still viable, and that

that all-encompassing language of (d)(4) doesn't really

apply to Dr. Marshall.

6

QUESTION:

It's

If we don't accept your position on

7

the Gonzalez Act, does this argument defeat you under the

8

Reform Act?

9

MR. OLENIEWSKI:

No, because in this particular

10

case — again, it is an incident that occurred in a

11

foreign country, and Congress doesn't really extend to a

12

foreign country.

13
14
15

That's why we don't believe --

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that one of the

limitations and exceptions to which (d)(4) refers?
MR. OLENIEWSKI-:

Well, if you look at the

16

introductory language to 2680, the language specifically

17

says that this section and this chapter shall not apply to

18

any of the following, which includes a foreign country.

19

The Reform Act happens to be located in that chapter,

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro —
I'm sorry.

Mr. Shapiro, while you're on the

13

Gonzalez Act-type things, could you explain to me the

14

purpose of the last part of subsection (f) of the Gonzalez
Act?

If the exclusiveness of remedy recited in the

16

Gonzalez Act, which language is very much like the

17

exclusiveness recitation in the Reform Act, if that

18

exclusiveness prevents an action against the employee,

19

even where there would be no action available against the

20

United States, what is the purpose of that provision which

21

allows the head of the agency to get liability insurance,

22

if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude

23

the remedies of third persons against the United States?

24

I — you know, I read that as embodying the assumption

25

7

us ultimately not to pursue the argument that the Gonzalez

8

Act itself precludes this action.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the point is that the first

10

part of the Gonzalez Act uses language that's very similar

11

to the language you're relying on in the Reform Act.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

13

QUESTION:

That's true.

And if — if in the Gonzalez Act they

14

didn't think that that language precluded the suit against

15

the individual, why would they in the Reform Act?

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

The Gonzalez Act is simply cloudy

17

on this point, and the other two parts of subsection (f)

18

may well embrace points that are consistent with a broader

19

reading of subsection (a) of the Gonzalez Act.

20

clause, as a general catch-all clause, seems to give what

we regard as the less plausible reading of the general

provision of Gonzalez.

There are other statutes similar
