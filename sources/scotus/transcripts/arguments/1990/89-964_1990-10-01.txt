ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS M. HART

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HART:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
From the lofty world of holding companies to the

10
11

more mundane world of a 1984 Ford, I'd like this Court to

12

revisit section 2314 of title 18 and decide what Congress

13

meant when it inserted two words into that statute 50

14

years ago.

15

Those two words are "falsely made."
As petitioner sees it, the question, really the

16

bottom line question is whether the term falsely made

17

means false in execution versus false in content.

18

Government has asserted, and so far they have won that

19

assertion, that the term should mean false in content.

20

They call this the broader definition of the two words.

21

The petitioner submits that this Court should reject that

22

position, because in the final analysis the only good

23

reason the Government can give for defining falsely made

24

as false in content is that it catches more people, and we

25

don't think that should be good enough for a criminal

The

1

statute.

2

QUESTION:

(Inaudible) claim that you have to

3

give some meaning to this provision, and it hasn't any

4

meaning if it really -- if we accept your interpretation

5

of the statute it has really no meaning.

6

MR. HART:

Yes, sir, that is their first

7

argument, and if the tape could reflect that I am

8

scratching my head, because I don't know why it must have

9

an independent meaning.

Certainly courts, the lower

10

circuit courts who have considered the question have often

11

used the words forgery and falsely made interchangeably,

12

and --

13

QUESTION:

Don't we usually follow the principle

14

that each -- each word or sentence or phrase of a law is

15

supposed to be given an independent meaning so that it

16

won't be simply superfluous?

17

MR. HART:

Yes, and that is the general rule.

18

do agree with that.

But that is not a rule that covers

19

everything, because, as I think anyone who reads these

20

statutes can find that the words falsely made, forged,

21

altered, or counterfeited are sort of a term of art, that

22

are contained in dozens of Federal statutes.

23

made is never defined.

24

many years have always concluded that falsely made equals

25

forged, with the exception of one or two cases which the

And falsely

And that is why lower courts over

I

1

Government points out.

Yet the Government also agrees —

2

QUESTION:

Like this case.

3

MR. HART:

Yes, Your Honor, like this case.

The

4

Government also agrees that that is not, number one, the

5

common law definition of falsely made, and number two,

6

they also agree that if you are to give this the

7

independent meaning which they advocate, it is a much

8

broader definition than what courts have normally

9

accepted.

But even if we accept the United States'

10

position that this must have an independent meaning, the

11

term falsely made, we believe this Court can supply that

12

meaning, that is, give an independent meaning to the word

13

falsely made, yet still not necessarily include the

14

conduct for which petitioner is charged with, that is the

15

inclusion of false information in an otherwise valid

16

document.

17

Now, the second position the Government

18

advocates is that — if I can phrase this correctly -- is

19

that they agree that the common law definition of falsely

20

made would not include what Mr. Moskal did.

21

that Congress is usually presumed to know what the common

22

law meaning was, and that it is the usual presumption that

23

Congress used the common law definition when they wrote

24

the words.

25

presumed to use the arcane, or what they call the

They also say

Yet they then argue that Congress cannot be

1

antiquated definition of the word.

2

that what we posit as falsely made is arcane and

3

antiquated.

4

And then they argue

And we submit they have never shown that.

We

5

submit that the only reason they can suggest the broader

6

definition is more modern is that it encompasses more

7

conduct.

8

number one, that there is nothing in the statute to

9

indicate that Congress wanted to expand the common law

Yet the United States and petitioner both agree

10

definition of falsely made.

11

history that indicates Congress wanted to expand the

12

common law definition of falsely made.

13

subsequent conduct by the Congress which reflects on that

Now —

15

QUESTION:

There is no legislative

And there is no

Mr. Hart, may I ask whether there is

16

any other statutory provision under which your client

17

could have been charged for transporting these Virginia

18

certificates?

19

MR. HART:

Certainly, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

What might that be?

21

MR. HART:

He was also charged with section 513

22

violation, which is the possession of forged State

23

securities.

24

that.

25

could be charged under the mail fraud statute.

There were two counts in the indictment for

the operation was nearly identical to what Mr. Moskal did.

He was charged with mail fraud, criminal mail

QUESTION;

10

But if this Court

Could Mr. Moskal have been charged

under section 2314 with regard to the Pennsylvania
certificates?

11

MR. HART:

Certainly, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Just not the Virginia titles.

13

MR. HART:

Certainly, and let me --

14

QUESTION:

But he wasn't charged with

15

transporting those?

16

MR. HART:

No, Your Honor.

And that — that

17

really -- the crux of our argument, is that the Government

18

argues that Mr. Moskal has found a loophole in this law

19

and he is trying to squeeze through it.

20

with such force that it makes me even feel guilty when I

21

read that.

22

Moskal didn't determine the charges that were placed

23

against him.

24

of Pennsylvania decided to charge him only with the

25

Virginia titles.

And they say this

1

Is this whole case just a tempest in

the Pennsylvania certificates.
MR. HART:

If we decide for you the Government isn't

QUESTION:

Is that it?

Well, to Mr. Moskal it's not a

subject to prosecution.
MR. HART:

10

type of prosecution that Mr. Moskal was.
QUESTION:

13

Certainly, Your Honor, but not the

Not prosecution under a — under a

regiment such as Virginia's.

MR. HART:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Well, let me

take that back.

law.

18

Yes, but not subject to Federal

prosecution under a licensing scheme such as that of

20

Virginia.

MR. HART:

21
22

Is that correct?
I am not certain I understand the

Court's question.
QUESTION:

Why can he be charged under your

theory with the Pennsylvania titles but not the Virginia

titles?

QUESTION:

Now, in Virginia -- how would you

describe those washed certificates?

Forged?

MR. HART:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Falsely made?

15

MR. HART:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Altered?

MR. HART:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, how could you be prosecuted

under this statute?

MR. HART:

23

Our belief is we could not be

prosecuted under 2314: for those Virginia titles.
QUESTION:

No, no, not the Virginia, the

Pennsylvania titles.

MR. HART:

The Pennsylvania titles were altered.

MR. HART:

Most certainly.

merely prosecutorial error, aren't you?

9

MR. HART:

I would be happy to call it that.

10

But the point is that we argued that both in the trial

11

court and the appellate court and they disagreed with us.

12

They said it was perfectly all right to charge Mr. Moskal

13

for those Virginia titles under 2314.

you think the terms forged and falsely made may have a

Yes and no.

Can

1

you give me an example of where a document is not forged

2

but it is falsely made?

3

MR. HART:

Yes.

A document that's obtained, for

4

instance, through bribery.

5

in this case, we'll take vehicle titles.

6

is obtained by someone passing a $50 bill to the title

7

clerk to generate a title.

That is a valid vehicle title
A vehicle title

8

We recently tried a case down the street where

9

someone stole a drivers license making machine, and just

10

spewed out drivers licenses that were valid in every

11

aspect.

12

QUESTION:

Well, those are forged, are they not?

13

MR. HART:

Well, that wasn't the question, but

14

they -- they were valid in the sense that they contained

15

the person's picture, his correct name, address.

16

Everything was valid, except it wasn't issued by the State

17

where they stole the license-making equipment.

18

situation can happen —

19

QUESTION:

20

that is not forgery.

21

how that works.

22

MR. HART:

Such a

I would be very surprised to see that
And your bribery, I'm not quite sure

Well, Your Honor, it would not be

23

forged in the sense that anything was changed on the

24

title.

25

actual ownership of the vehicle.

It would be a correct title.

It may well reflect

Everything on the face

1

of the title may be correct, but the point is it wasn't

2

obtained through the State Secretary of State; it was

3

obtained through illegal means, bribery or theft or

4

something of that nature.

5

QUESTION:

I think what you are arguing is that

6

falsely made, if it does not mean the same thing as

7

forged, altered, or counterfeited, at least means that the

8

person who makes it must know that he is falsely making

9

it.

10

MR. HART:

Yes.

11

QUESTION:

So the bribery doesn't have anything

12

to do with it.

The point is that if the person who makes

13

it is not being false, if he thinks it's accurate, you

14

would not consider that falsely made.

15

MR. HART:

I would agree with that.

16

QUESTION:

Whereas if the official himself knows

17

he is writing down something that is in error, he would be

18

making it falsely.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

But how does that help you?

I'm

sorry, go ahead.
QUESTION:

And you assert that that helps your

22

case by giving some different meaning to falsely made, if

23

a different meaning is required.

24

position, that a different meaning isn't required anyway.

25

MR. HART:

And that is your other

I couldn't have said it better.

QUESTION:

1

Well, but Mr. Hart, the statute

2

itself says "knowing the same to have been falsely made"

3

as an additional requirement.

4

reading that language into one of the other provisions of

5

the statute?

MR. HART:

I am not sure that it does make it

Well, I thought you just said that

you agreed with Justice Scalia's hypothesis?

How does that help make it clear?

clear.

8

9

What is the sense of

Well, I -- I do, but I don't think

that necessarily makes it clear in Mr. Moskal's case.
QUESTION:

12

But the knowingly, knowing the same

13

to have been so and so applies to the defendant in the

14

criminal case.

15

MR. HART:

Certainly.

16

QUESTION:

Not to some State official who may or

17

may not know that this instrument is falsely made.

18

MR. HART:

Yes .

19

QUESTION:

Because the Virginia people didn't

20

know that there was anything phony about this whole deal,

21

did they?

22

MR. HART:

That's correct.

23

QUESTION:

But if they had — what if the

24

Virginia guy was in on it?

25

you would say it was falsely made.

That's correct.

Then I think you would think,

MR. HART:

1

Yes, yes.

But the question then

2

would be is Mr. Moskal guilty of the transportation of

3

those facially valid titles from Virginia to Pennsylvania.

4

QUESTION:

They were falsely made.

5

MR. HART:

No.

No, they — because there was

6

nothing wrong with the execution of the document.

document accurately reflects what its intended purpose is,

8

and that is the ownership of the vehicle, it is a valid

9

title, and the transportation of that across a State line

If the

should not be against the law.
QUESTION:

11

Even if the official preparing and

12

issuing the document has knowledge of the falsity and

13

intends thereby that people be deceived by it?

14

MR. HART:

I would say yes, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Is that your position now?

16

MR. HART:

Yes, I would say yes.

17

QUESTION:

So you have changed your position a

18

little bit, I take it.

19

MR. HART:

Yes, but I would make one

20

distinction, because the case — that question has arisen

21

before.

22

by the identity of the vehicle or the ownership of the

23

vehicle, then we believe that that piece of paper, even if

24

facially fine, is invalid as a document.

QUESTION:

3

It was only the odometer.

I don't understand why that makes a

difference.

4

MR. HART:

It makes a -- well

5

QUESTION:

Because the odometer reading is an

6

important material part of the piece of paper, isn't it?

7
8

You think that is just put in for the

MR. HART:

No, sir, but I don't believe it is

any more important than say horsepower, or color, or make.

QUESTION:
fun of it?

Well, I disagree with that, Your

Honor.

MR. HART:

QUESTION:
the former owner?

Maybe not, or what about the name of
Why is that important to a purchaser?

MR. HART:

Well, it's important for title

16

purposes, that is you would want to know the chain of

17

title.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but if the statute on titles

19

requires the odometer reading to be put in, I presume it

20

wants an accurate one, doesn't it?

MR. HART:

Yes, and there are laws that make

that an offense to -QUESTION:

Well, sure, and there are separate

what this is, as I understand it.

4

MR. HART:

And that is

Well, yes, in some respects it is,

5

but if I can pose the question would the title pass if the

6

odometer was completely false?

7

QUESTION:

And the answer to that —■

It would pass even if you had a

8

forged signature of the owner, you had a forged name --

9

you have all sorts of forgery on that title and it will

10

still pass.
MR. HART:

11

It will still pass, but it's subject

12

to challenge.

13

It would be no different than the wrong color of the car.

14

Whereas an odometer reading, it would not.

QUESTION:

You don't think if someone could come

15

in and prove that the seller lied about the odometer

16

reading he could rescind the transaction?

17
18

MR. HART:

Not under the theory that the title

did not pass.

19

QUESTION:

Are you telling me that it's

20

important to have the name of the person who owned the

21

car?

22

23

MR. HART:

I believe that the State statutes

usually require that.

QUESTION:

But is it important to the purchaser?

Well, I imagine that would vary from

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

1

Your Honor, the making of a

automobile title involves the incorporation of information

from the prior title, plus some additional information

4

supplied by the new purchaser to State authorities.

5

then return a new title incorporating the information.

process is corrupted through the addition of false

information, and the end product, the Virginia title

yes, Your Honor, but it's — it's one that has some

important limitations as well.

QUESTION:

Well, do you, before you get to the

20

limitations, do you concede that at common law the terms

21

falsely made would not include the Virginia title?

and false in content.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Now, there were fictions

developed because that line was not entirely satisfactory.

I agree that none of the fictions present in 1934 would

that it's false, as opposed to just having been given

money, mean to incorporate all of the common law

common purpose the creation of Federal criminal penalties

15

for criminal activity that extended across State lines.

Congress enacted those bills, recognizing that interstate

cases, more serious harm to the individuals.

As originally enacted that bill, the National

In that context, Your Honor, I believe that we

are cut loose in many States from the concept that the

title is needed to pass title as such.

the 1984 legislation that added this provision was

designed to deal with the problem of washing and changing

titles to deal with stolen cars primarily, although there

was indication of odometer fraud as well.

that were dealing with the problem were told that a good

21

way to title a stolen car would be to get a hold of an

automobile title, alter the identification number to match

the one of the car that had been stolen, wash that title,

and then end up with an apparently valid — validly titled

But since 1980 Congress has had the

opportunity to clear that up, and has not.

I mention that is because in examining the history of 2314

with the Government, the Tenth Circuit has agreed with the

petitioner, and what we consider a similar case, the

22

district court in Rudge have agreed with the petitioner.

worst, for the Government, it's consideration of different

the petitioner did in this case.

And finally we'd observe that the Government is

3

going to get into problems if it talks about materiality,

because what the Government didn't mention is that one of

the titles in this case was altered by a pencil mark, just

to draw a bright line between vehicle model and vehicle
