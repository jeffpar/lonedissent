ORAL ARGUMENT OF DON W. ATKINS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. ATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether the

11

confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment is violated

12

when the notice and hearing provision of the Michigan Rape

13

Shield Law is applied to exclude arguably relevant

14

evidence when no attempt is made to cure the defect until

15

the very day of trial.

16

this particular case held that not only the 10-day notice

17

provision, but also the pretrial hearing provision of the

18

Rape Shield Law, violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment

19

rights to confrontation, quote,

20

the evidence of specific instances of prior sexual conduct

21

between the complainant and the defendant."

22

The Michigan court of appeals in

"when applied to preclude

At the outset let me make clear what the statute

23

both requires and what it prohibits.

What the statute

24

requires simply is two things:

25

within 10 days after the arraignment on the information

that a notice be filed

1

requesting the court to hold a hearing to determine

2

whether particular evidence of prior sexual conduct

3

between the defendant and the victim is relevant and is to

4

be admitted.

5

important procedural aspect of this case, and that is the

6

pretrial hearing to determine whether or not the evidence

7

is both logically and legally admissible in the case when

8

tried.

9

This notice in turn triggers a very

The importance, I think, of the Rape Shield Law,

10

at least the one we're dealing with here in Michigan, is

11

that the underlying principle of that particular notice

12

provision serves two very fundamental purposes.

13

premise, of course, that the legislature of Michigan

14

decided upon was that the victim of sexual assaults

15

certainly has a right to her sexual privacy, and that in

16

doing so we want to counterbalance that interest, which I

17

believe is clearly a legitimate interest, with the

18

interest of the defendant.

19

QUESTION:

The major

And how best to do that?

Well, Mr. Atkins, in this case aren't

20

we dealing just with the notice requirement of this

21

statute?

Isn't that all we have before us here?

22

MR. ATKINS:

23

QUESTION:

Precisely correct, Your Honor.
And the statute does not itself

24

specify what the trial court will do if the notice is not

25

given in a timely fashion.

1

MR. ATKINS:

2

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And in this case the trial court

3

decided to preclude the testimony and the evidence because

4

of the failure to comply with the notice requirement.

5

MR. ATKINS:

6

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And the Michigan court of appeals

7

held that preclusion of the evidence in every case would

8

be unconstitutional.

9

MR. ATKINS:

10

In this particular -QUESTION:

11

I believe that's what they said.

So that's what we have to review,

12

whether that approach is correct and whether there might

13

be some cases were preclusion is allowable.
MR. ATKINS:

14

Yes, Your Honor.

I would not be

15

standing before the Court today except for the facts in

16

this case, in which the default occurred on the very day

17

of trial, some 7 months after the arraignment on the

18

information.

19

that there has to be, to protect the defendant's Sixth

20

Amendment rights, a sliding scale of remedies, if you

21

will.

22

which the notice had been filed on the eleventh day after

23

the arraignment on the information, or perhaps at some

24

other reasonable time before trial in the case, and I

25

don't know what that time would be, it could be as little

I would -- readily admit to the Court today

If in fact this case had turned on a situation in

1

as 2 days, it could be as little as a week, but somewhere

2

in between there the court, the trial court hearing that

3

motion must determine that automatic preclusion is not an

4

appropriate remedy.

5

QUESTION:

6

7

The statute simply doesn't say what

the remedy is, does it?
MR. ATKINS:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

8

is correct.

9

preclusion because it is indeed silent upon that.

That

The statute does not require outright
It says

10

it shall not be admissible, but it does not indicate that

11

total preclusion is the only remedy.

12

suggesting that that should be the only remedy.

13

QUESTION:

And I am not

You said there were two interests

14

that the State had, and one is the privacy rights of the

15

victim, and what's the other?

16

MR. ATKINS:

The other one is the balancing of

17

the rights of the defendant, the confrontational rights of

18

the defendant.

19

as correctly noted earlier, is that we're dealing with a

20

notice provision.

21

to provide a defendant in a criminal case with a window of

22

opportunity, if you will, a window which will permit him

23

to bring before the trier of fact, or in this case the

24

trial judge I should say, to determine outside of the

25

presence of the jury whether the evidence he wishes to

Because the only issue before the Court,

1

bring in is logically and legally relevant and admissible.

2

QUESTION:

Is there much doubt in this case but

3

that the evidence should not have been admitted had the

4

notice been given?
MR. ATKINS:

5
6

Honor?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ATKINS:

9

Should not have been admitted, Your

Or should have been admitted?
Taking it either way, Your Honor, I

think there is a legitimate argument that could be made,

10

and I think I attempted to make it earlier in my brief,

11

that what I think we were dealing with in this particular

12

case was not so much the evidence of the actual details of

13

the sexual encounters that they experienced in a previous

14

time before this event.

15

wished to get across to the court and the trier of fact

16

was that there was an intimate relationship which may have

17

included a sexual aspect to that relationship.

18

What the defendant, I think,

There was no indication of an offer of proof or

19

otherwise that the specific details of the sexual

20

encounters they had earlier, before these events occurred

21

on August 31, had any particular relevance to the defense

22

presented at trial.

23

because we had a intimate relationship at an earlier time.

24
25

The defense was one of consent

Nevertheless, whether or not that's the case, a
general sexual aspect of the relationship, or whether a

1

specific sexual act was important, I don't believe is

2

truly necessary for this Court's consideration.

3

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that if there had

4

been a hearing in the case the judge would have given

5

certain instructions and rulings as to the extent to which

6

this relationship could have been described?

7

MR. ATKINS:

I don't think there's any question

8

but that the judge could have fashioned a remedy.

9

-- clearly he could have.

There

He could have either permitted,

10

if the evidence which the defendant wished to place before

11

the trier of fact required the details of past sexual

12

encounters, or just simply the fact that there had been a

13

sexual relationship.

14

But again, what this case is not about, it's not

15

about whether or not there was a case of ineffective

16

assistance of counsel, and it's not about whether or not

17

the trial judge abused his discretion by utilizing a

18

preclusion evidence -- of the evidence, and it's not about

19

whether the actual evidence which may have been offered

20

would have been relevant and otherwise admissible.

21

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that there are

22

substantial privacy rights of the victim that could and

23

would likely have been protected in this case had some

24

advance notice, particularly the notice required by the

25

statute, been given?

MR. ATKINS:

QUESTION:

That is precisely my point.
What happens in a preliminary hearing

in a case like this?

hearing.

MR. ATKINS:

7

QUESTION:

I take it from the record that this

It was in fact.
That doesn't sound like it's got,

8

that the State has much interest in the privacy of the

9

victim, if a public preliminary hearing washes all this

10
11

linen.
MR. ATKINS:

It is true, Your Honor, and it's

12

quite regrettable, and I believe, and I'll admit to the

13

Court that I think the prosecutor at the preliminary

14

examination simply dropped the ball.

15

have been made --

18

QUESTION:

An objection should

Would the statute apply to the

preliminary hearing?
MR. ATKINS:

I believe it would have, because

19

the statute is silent as to what occurs prior to trial.

20

All that the statute permits is that 10-day window of

21

opportunity.

22

that, but nevertheless, I think the purposes of that could

23

have been prevented at the preliminary examination.

It is maybe silent as to what occurs before

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ATKINS:

On what grounds?
The examination -- well, if nothing

1

else, Your Honor, certainly on relevance grounds.

2

at the examination, the focus of the preliminary

3

examination is only to determine probable cause.

4

question of what defense may arise later at trial is not

5

properly before a preliminary examination magistrate.

6

that that magistrate needs to determine is whether or not

7

there is probable cause to believe the crime has been

8

committed, and whether or not this defendant may have

9

committed it.
QUESTION:

Because

preliminary brought out by the prosecutor?

QUESTION:

Are there provisions in Michigan for

closing the preliminary hearings?

MR. ATKINS:

There are provisions, Your Honor,

but I don't believe it would have applied in this case

anyway.

didn't object.

1

simply to protect at every possible opportunity, and it

2

should not preclude the admission or the exclusion of the

3

evidence at any subsequent hearing, whether it be at

4

pretrial hearing after the arraignment or whether it be at

5

the trial itself.

QUESTION:

7

MR. ATKINS:

10

The trial is before a 12-person jury?
This one wasn't.

But of course it

would have been otherwise, because of the —
QUESTION:
MR. ATKINS:

Was this a bench trial?
It ended up being a bench trial

11

after the oral motion made on the day of trial was denied.

12

At that point, immediately thereafter, the defendant and

13

his counsel waived the right to jury trial, and then the

14

case was heard by the very judge who in fact heard the

15

oral motion for permission to admit that evidence.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Atkins, what is the State's --

17

there's no question about the interest in the victim's

18

privacy or in the defendant's right to confrontation.

19

do you articulate the State's interest in requiring notice

20

so early on in the proceeding, 10 days from the --

10 days after the arraignment on

And I

1

legislature's interest in it.

But in this particular case

2

trials in Michigan, once the arraignment of the

3

information is had, actually enters onto a relatively fast

4

track.

5

case inquiry notice, which is part of the court record,

6

would indicate that the trial date originally was set for

7

sometime in late November, a period of only 4 weeks after

8

the arraignment on the information.

In this case I think the docket entries and the

9

There was a final conference date of November

10

14, 1984, at which point the first adjournment was had.

11

What I am trying to indicate, of course, to the Justice is

12

this, that the 10-day period after the arraignment was set

13

because essentially many cases in Michigan, even cases

14

such as this, a major felony case, could be tried within a

15

very short period of time after the arraignment.

16

QUESTION:

So that we really ought to look at it

17

not so much as a case requiring, or a statute requiring

18

notice 10 days after arraignment, but requiring notice say

19

3 or 4 weeks before the trial date?

20

equally accurate way of looking at the effect of this?

21

MR. ATKINS:

That would be an

I think it could have been done

22

either way, Your Honor, but I think the arraignment on the

23

information date was selected because, quite frankly,

24

Federal felony trials such as this could be tried,

25

certainly in Wayne County even though it's a busy

So by setting it earlier you accomplish a

It also provides another important aspect, and

12

that is for the judge in the individual case.

Rather than

13

getting to a position 1 day or the day of trial in which

14

you have what may be called hydraulic pressures upon the

15

court to go at that time with the trial, if you have a

16

pretrial hearing sufficiently in advance of trial, the

17

trial judge has the opportunity to sit back calmly, if you

18

will, or at least in a more detached, less pressurized

19

atmosphere, to consider the arguments and the evidence of

20

prosecution's evidence.

view, is that you have an opportunity again for that

2

thorough analysis beforehand of permitting a more

3

realistic, even-handed approach.
QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Atkins, I didn't think the

5

court below addressed the question of whether the notice

period is too short.

MR. ATKINS:

QUESTION:

9

MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:

10

Is that before us?
No, I don't believe it is.
No?
That particular question is not.
And why isn't the State's interest

11

sufficiently protected, even though the request comes late

12

to consider this testimony and offer it, if the trial

13

court grants an in camera hearing and considers

14

alternative sanctions but lets the evidence in?

15

isn't that a possibility and an appropriate way to address

16

the State's interests?

17

MR. ATKINS:

I mean,

It could be in other situations,

18

Your Honor.

Again, I think this particular case is

19

important, and it's important to the Court I think because

20

it came on the day of trial.

21

think it would be entirely appropriate and, in guarding

22

the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, to be able at a

23

sufficient time before trial to hold this kind of a

24

hearing.

course as in Taylor v. Illinois, the Court held that a

something you said in response to one of Justice

MR. ATKINS:

Is it correct that you agree that

Yes.
Okay.
Absolutely.

General Starr.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Over the past 15 to 20 years, 48 States and the
Congress of the United States have passed rape shield
statutes.

Michigan's law was the first.

It was the first

in a series of efforts throughout the Nation to protect
rape victims, and specifically of responding to the
problem of forcing rape victims to endure what frequently
became, in the view of the Congress of the United States
and other State legislatures, an unnecessarily humiliating
process with the systemic effect that, in the view of
Congress, rape victims were less willing to report this
chronically under-reported crime.
QUESTION:

May I ask, General Starr, in the

survey, is this the only statute that has this particular
10-day notice requirement?
MR. STARR:

That is correct.

However, it is my

1

understanding, as Mr. Atkins indicated, that the

2

arraignment date in Michigan is in fact closely tied,

3

ordinarily, to the trial date.

4

QUESTION:

But the only reason I ask you, I

5

suppose if we affirm in this case it would not necessarily

6

invalidate the rape shield statutes all over the country.
MR. STARR:

7

Well, except that the ground on

8

which this statute was invalidated did not have to do with

9

the timing of the notice.

It had to do, rather, with to

10

whom this statute applied.

11

the State courts, there was no indication at all that the

12

period for challenging or for educing the notice and to

13

file the appropriate motion and the like was unreasonable.

14

Indeed it couldn't have been here.

15

As I understand the attack in

This was a twice-continued trial.

This

16

proceeding was originally scheduled for trial in November

17

of 1984.

It was twice postponed at the defendant's

18

request.

And yet it was only on May 14, the first day of

19

trial, that counsel says in utter -- not present counsel,

20

but trial counsel says in utter violation of the rule, I

21

want to educe evidence even though I know it goes against

22

the statute.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but the trial judge would have

excluded it even if the offer had been made on the

25

eleventh day, as I understand.

MR. STARR:

1

Oh, I disagree with that, with all

2

respect, Justice Stevens.

I think the message of the

3

courts of Michigan are quite clear that preclusion as a

4

remedy is a remedy that should be carefully calibrated,

5

just as this Court taught in cases such as Taylor against

6

Illinois.

7

Judge Farmer said, the transcript can be read, if you give

8

it a hard reading, to suggest automatic preclusion.

would suggest, Justice Stevens, that the better, more

And the answer to that surely is no, that

This Court has held time and again that States

The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are

filled with notice provisions that must be complied with.

12

A notice provision is in fact simply a way of ordering the

13

procedure so that a determination can be made as to

14

whether this evidence is admissible or not.

15

In response to Justice Kennedy's point, it seems

16

to me that there is a potential here that some, much

17

perhaps, of this evidence would have been deemed relevant

18

if the appropriate proceedings had been followed.

19

However, and I think this is an important part of this

20

case, this evidence is not the critical sort of evidence,

21

the key sort of evidence that has troubled this Court in

22

cases such as Chambers against Mississippi, Rock against

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

MR. MAGIDSON:

9

No, Justice O'Connor.

No.

I don't think so.

I think

what the Michigan court of appeals was saying as in this

this case the defense of consent.

15

QUESTION:

Well, it certainly appears, if you

look at the authorities they rely on, that the Michigan

10

the trial counsel was correct in not seeking to bring the

12

The problem then with this strict application of

13

this statute which required that the time limits must be

14

strictly complied with, as well as the preclusion

15

sanctions which followed, caused two problems.

16

problems are then what is the remedy when a defense

this notice requirement, and then what are the

consequences of precluding that evidence or testimony.

since it was testimony only involving the defendant and

1

And then they in effect rejected the

2

State's claim that this evidence, quite apart from notice,

3

could be reviewed and excluded if it was not material?
MR. MAGIDSON:

4

I think the court of appeals

5

indicated that this becomes like just a normal type of

6

weighing the prejudicial effect versus probative value,

7

and that if it was in fact more prejudicial than

8

probative, then it wouldn't be admitted and that a

9

separate hearing could have been held outside the presence

10

of the jury to do that.

11

these type of cases.
QUESTION:

12

And that is normally done in

Well, they, the Michigan court of

13

appeals reversed this conviction because, as I read it, it

14

said that, that what is left is the usual evidentiary

15

issues of the materiality of the evidence to the issues in

16

the case and the balancing of its probative value with the

17

danger of unfair prejudice.

This opinion is limited, as I see

it, to the particular facts of this case where the --

11

there had been notice already and the trial court failed

12

to exercise its discretion in getting this information.

13

The failure to go into this, to permit this, it was

14

suggested by counsel that it was not that big a deal, but

15

the thing is that this was important testimony on the

16

issue, in a narrow issue of consent.

17

failure to allow inquiry into this past sexual

18

relationship undermined the integrity of the fact-finding

process.

In these cases the

There would be some

A couple of

1

very brief points I would like to make.

2

Court in reading the case will understand that what the

3

court of appeals of Michigan did in this case was really

4

say flat out that whenever you're excluding evidence which

5

involves prior sexual conduct between the defendant and

6

the complainant in a particular case, that alone -- that

7

alone violates the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.

8

The only issue that I think is properly before this Court,

9

as I have tried to emphasize earlier in this case, is that

10

the question being whether the operation of the notice and

11

prehearing provisions of the Rape Shield Law in and of

12

themselves are violative of a defendant's right to

13

confrontation.

14

is simply that.

That is the only issue.

QUESTION:

15

I believe if the

I think the issue

Mr. Atkins, Justice White asked your

16

colleague a question about whether the last part of the

17

opinion of the court of appeals in this case doesn't

18

suggest that the testimony could have been excluded on the

19

basis of its material -- lack of materiality or on the

20

balancing process, the thought being that the court of

21

appeals suggested that the trial court might have done

22

that.

QUESTION:

I mean, but I'm interested in your

2

view of whether or not the Michigan court of appeals said

3

that or held that.

4

MR. ATKINS:

No, Your Honor.

I -- again I would

5

say that I think the Michigan court of appeals said flat

6

out that the statute was unconstitutional, period, when

7

applied to prior sexual conduct between the defendant and

the victim, and those being the two --

QUESTION:

10

MR. ATKINS:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

of requiring notice?
MR. ATKINS:

In this case, you mean?
Yes, Your Honor, I do believe that.
You mean just the fact of having -Requiring notice -Well, the notice -- I think they

14

have said that both the notice and the pretrial hearing

15

provision, in camera hearing provision, were both in --

16

together -- tandem, unconstitutional when applied to this

17

situation without any further consideration.

18

QUESTION:

They didn't say the notice provision

19

was unconstitutional, only enforcing it by exclusion was

20

unconstitutional.

21

MR. ATKINS:

I'm not so sure that that is quite

22

how I see it either, Your Honor, but I do see it as a

23

situation in which the notice itself cannot, in my

24

opinion, preclude a defendant from -- or deny a defendant

25

his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.

I think the

1

issues of whether or not the evidence may have been

2

relevant, again whether they are issues of ineffective

3

assistance of counsel and failure to raise it, are all

4

collateral issues which, even in the State of Michigan, a

5

defendant can raise in subsequent proceedings after

consideration by this Court.

7

But I think again, in conclusion, Your Honor,

8

that there is nothing in the Constitution which would have

prevented the kind of remedy provided here.

I would say

in a lesser situation perhaps something else would have

been appropriate, but I think the line has to be drawn and
