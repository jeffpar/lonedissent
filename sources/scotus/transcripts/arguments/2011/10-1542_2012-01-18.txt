5

and the consolidated case.

Ms. Kruger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Under section 1229b of Title 8, an alien who

12

has not been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5

13

years, or who has not continuously resided in the United

14

States for at least 7 years following admission in any

15

status, is not eligible for cancellation of removal

16

under the first prong of the statute.

17

regardless of whether the alien can show that his

18

parents, or any other third party, for that matter, did

19

satisfy those requirements.

That is true

The Ninth Circuit, alone among the courts of

20
21

appeals, has recognized a rule of imputed eligibility

22

under section 1229b(a).

23

two reasons.

24

plain text of the statute.

25

That rule is wrong for at least

First of all, it is inconsistent with the

The touchstones of eligibility under section
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1229b(a), LPR status, admission, and residence, are all

2

terms that are defined in the INA to refer to attributes

3

that are individual to the alien seeking relief,

4

attributes that cannot be satisfied by a third party.

5

But even if the statute were thought to be

6

ambiguous with respect to this question, the Board of

7

Immigration Appeals has interpreted the statute to mean

8

that the alien seeking relief must personally and

9

actually satisfy both durational requirements.

That

10

interpretation is at the very least a reasonable reading

11

of the statute, if not the only reasonable reading of

12

the statute.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But did it make that

14

determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its

15

discretion?

16

to come to that conclusion as a matter of law.

As I read its opinion, it felt that it had

17

MS. KRUGER:

I think --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we were to find the

19

statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy

20

decisions independent of its legal conclusions?

21

MS. KRUGER:

First of all, Justice

22

Sotomayor, we don't think the statute is ambiguous; and

23

so, we don't think there's any reason to go to Chevron

24

step two in this case.

25

But if you look at the Board's decision in
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Escobar in particular, I think the Board makes clear

2

that, although it thought the statutory language was

3

clear, it also rested its decision on other

4

considerations that are uniquely within the Board's

5

expertise.

6

comports with the general policies of the statute, how

7

it comports with the rule that the Board itself has

8

recognized over time, that LPR status is something

9

that's individual to a particular alien, and that the

It discussed how the imputation rule

10

alien seeking relief has to individually, both

11

procedurally and substantively, satisfy the eligibility

12

requirements.

13

And it also noted that the imputation rule

14

would create significant holes in the statutory scheme.

15

It would mean that an individual who may not even have

16

been eligible for admission to the United States or

17

lawful admission for permanent residence would

18

nevertheless receive a significant benefit that goes

19

along with that status.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

You say that you

21

think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't

22

address issues of imputation at all, does it?

23
24
25

MS. KRUGER:

It does not address issues of

imputation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, if it doesn't

Official

1

even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is

2

that it's ambiguous.

3

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I don't think that a

4

statute, as this Court has recognized, has to address

5

every conceivable possibility in order to be

6

unambiguous.

7

in that it refers to eligibility requirements that are

8

by their nature, as defined in immigration law,

9

individual to a specific alien.

And this statute, I think, is unambiguous

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's --

10

What about -- there

11

was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile --

12

a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based

13

on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the

14

child's?

15

MS. KRUGER:

Right.

There -- the

16

Respondents relied very heavily on three court of

17

appeals cases that had interpreted the predecessor to

18

this statute, former section 212(c), to allow imputation

19

of a parent's domicile to a child.

20

on the common law rule that a child's domicile follows

21

that of his parents.

22

allowed children to rely on their parents' domicile in

23

the United States to satisfy the 7-year lawful

24

unrelinquished domicile requirement in that statute.

25

Those courts relied

And applying that rule, they

I guess a child doesn't

1

have any domicile except the parents'; right?

2

who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do

3

they?

4

MS. KRUGER:

Children

Under this Court's decision in

5

Holyfield, the common law rule is that the child's

6

domicile is determined by that of his parents,

7

regardless of where the child resides in fact.

8

Congress repealed former section 212(c) and enacted the

9

current cancellation of removal statute, it removed any

10

reference to the word "domicile," instead replacing the

11

requirement of 7 years unrelinquished domicile with two

12

durational requirements that are at issue in this case.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When

Is that change alone

14

sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear

15

indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to

16

alter the imputation rule?

17

MS. KRUGER:

I think if this Court is

18

willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress

19

would have been aware of these three court of appeals

20

decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very

21

late in the life of a provision that had existed in more

22

or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917,

23

then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware

24

that the basis for those decisions was the common law

25

definition of the term "domicile" and that Congress
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

meant what it did when it replaced "domicile" with three

2

eligibility criteria that are defined terms in the

3

immigration law and all of which refer to attributes

4

that are individual to a specific alien.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does a child who is not

6

emancipated have the capacity to independently establish

7

a residence?

8
9

MS. KRUGER:

Under the -- how the INA

defines the term "residence" is an actual principal

12

in marked contrast to the common law rule of domicile

13

that this Court explained at length in its Holyfield

14

decision and that the courts of appeals applied in

15

interpreting former section 212(c).

So, yes, a child will dwell somewhere

Can a parent ask for a

permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child?

overcome the plain threshold requirements for

15

eligibility for the exercise of discretion under 1229b.

16

But it has never been thought that particularly

The difficulty with the imputation rule that

resident status and long-time continuous residence after

I think it's also worth noting that this

statute is not the beginning and the end of discretion

in the immigration system.

statute in 1996, that immigration officials have the

discretion not to bring removal proceedings in the first

-- with his parents and remained here illegally until he

He entered the United States illegally with the

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was admitted as an LPR at the age of 19 as an adult.

2

Until that time, there were no efforts to remove him

3

from the United States, and I think that that's fairly

4

typical, but that's not because his parents' admission

5

or their lawful status in the United States was imputed

6

to Martinez Gutierrez, and there is no background

7

principle in the law that would allow for such

8

imputation of an individual formal authorization to

9

remain in the country by immigration officials to be

10
11

imputed from one to another.
Rather, the immigration system sets up a

12

system in which a lawful permanent resident parent can

13

seek to -- to petition for an immigration visa on behalf

14

of a child and facilitate that child's eventual

15

adjustment to lawful permanent resident status, but it's

16

not something happens automatically.

17

that happens through a regular, orderly process.

Can you give me an example

of an instance in which a child who is the child of two

resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he

22

can at the age of 15?

23

between that period that would make him ineligible --

24

eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter

25

of providing all the documents?

point here is that some children are given lawful

5

permanent resident status and -- and some are not.

6

I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two

7

8

who was formerly ineligible is now eligible?

9

10

But

scenario is one in which a visa number doesn't become

I think Respondents place a great deal of emphasis on

21

the amount of time it takes for visa numbers to become

22

available for both children and spouses of lawful

permanent residents, but that has been a regular and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. KRUGER:

So,

Well, that's correct.
Yes.

That's correct.

But I think

20

the critical point is that the agency has interpreted

imputation of intent, of state of mind, to be

22

permissible, in part for the same reason that the common

23

law rule about domicile formed, which is that --

imputations that exist in immigration law are all a

MS. KRUGER:

I think that that's -- all of

3

the imputations that Respondents have pointed to concern

4

state of mind type requirements.

5

formal authorizations by immigration officials.

6

Board, I think, has been very consistent, certainly in

7

the context of cancellation of removal, in not imputing

8

the legal status of being an LPR or admission from

9

parent to child.

They don't concern
The

And it's difficult to see any other

10

examples in which such imputation would be permissible,

11

in part because the background presumption of the

12

immigration law is that those are both attributes that

13

have to be individually achieved and the eligibility

14

criteria have to be independently satisfied by each

15

individual alien.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why is a parent's

fraudulent conduct imputed to a child?

There's no

intent there.

intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime.

act.

4

But, putting that aside, there's no intent

MS. KRUGER:

It's just the commission of an

Well, I think that where the

5

imputation has come in, in the Board's analysis, is with

6

respect to the state of mind and not with respect to the

7

objective conduct.

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the state of mind

of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?
MS. KRUGER:

It's -- I think where this has

11

come up is in the context of knowing that the -- that

12

the alien is not in fact admissible to the United

13

States, is generally where it's come up.

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not --

The child doesn't commit

a fraudulent act.
MS. KRUGER:

But, again, I think that the

17

principle that the Board has applied is that, because

18

the child is presumed not capable of forming a requisite

19

intent, the parent's intent is imputed to the child.

20

But I think for present purposes the

21

critical point is, even in that context, what is being

22

imputed is not a formal status conferred on an

23

individual alien by immigration officials, or admission,

24

a formal authorization to enter the country.

25

again, conferred on an individual basis by immigration
22
Alderson Reporting Company

That is,

Official

1

officials.

I think Respondents can identify no

2

circumstance, no precedent, for that type of imputation,

3

and it's one that would be inconsistent with the basic

4

structure of the immigration system.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They do say -It's a little odd that the

7

domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements,

8

and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile

9

case but not -- not in the residence case.

10

It seems

almost backward.

11

MS. KRUGER:

Well, to be --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress enacts a more

13

forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes

14

away the imputation.

15

MS. KRUGER:

Well, to be clear,

16

Justice Kennedy, Congress did not supply a definition of

17

the term "domicile."

18

opinions that Respondents are relying on followed the

19

common law rule that says that a child's domicile

20

follows that of his parents, but those courts applied

21

that rule in very different ways.

22

And so, the court of appeals

Two courts of appeals permitted children to

23

benefit from the domicile of their parents in the United

24

States even when they were not even physically present

25

in the United States for the full 7-year period; whereas
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Ninth Circuit, for its part, applied that rule only

2

where the alien child had been -- had entered the United

3

States lawfully with his parents, according to the Ninth

4

Circuit, remains lawfully in the United States

5

thereafter, and simply had become an LPR outside of the

6

full 7-year period.

7

In crafting the current cancellation of

8

removal statute, there's no reason to believe that

9

Congress was aware of these three court of appeals

10

opinions that were, again, decided very late in the life

11

of former section 212(c).

12

of those decisions, it also would have been aware that

13

by using defined terms in the INA that are defined in a

14

way that's individual to the particular alien, it was

15

eliminating any reference to the common law rule.

16

But even if it had been aware

Unlike domicile, there is no rule that says

17

that a child's LPR status follows that of his parents or

18

that a child's admission follows that of its parents.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. KRUGER:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't see how the -- you

can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases

24

25

4

5

earlier case, the parents had never been admitted.

their conclusion without it.

10

And then there's a different split in the

11

circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods,

12

you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera.

13

that seems to be what Congress resolved.

14

And

So, I think if you're talking about what was

15

the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did

16

impute for residence.

17

doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly

18

different thing.

19

think?

20

And then Congress sort of just

Is that a fair reading, or what do you

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think it is, but first

21

I'd like to clarify that the Ninth Circuit had no reason

22

to impute residence in Lepe-Guitron, in part because the

23

alien in that case had resided in fact in the United

24

States throughout the 7-year period.

25

Respondents make the argument that Lepe-Guitron was in
25
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official

1

fact imputing LPR status, as opposed to residence in

2

fact.

3

But I think that that is an incorrect

4

reading of the Ninth Circuit's decision as well, and

5

that's for the following reason:

6

appeals that Respondents rely on dealt separately with

7

the threshold requirement under former section 212(c)

8

that the alien be a lawful permanent resident.

9

those three courts permitted LPR status to be imputed

All three courts of

None of

11

requirement in the statute that LPR status be obtained

12

by the alien seeking relief, the courts were very clear

13

in requiring that the alien before them independently

14

satisfied that requirement.

15

So, where there was an explicit

In Lepe-Guitron, the Ninth Circuit

16

acknowledged that, under circuit precedent, it had held

17

that domicile requires an intent to remain permanently

18

in the United States lawfully and said that that meant

19

that the alien had to be in LPR status.

20

said that with respect to children, that intent to

21

remain in the United States lawfully need not be an LPR

22

status so long as their parents were lawfully domiciled

23

in the United States.

If the Court has no further questions, I'd

NO. 10-1542
MR. KINNAIRD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Children present special problems under the
immigration laws, and, as discussed, both the courts and

10

the agency in various contexts have resorted to

11

imputation to cure those problems.

12

statute is silent as to imputation, and ambiguity arises

13

as applied to the special circumstance of children who

14

were minors during the years in question.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And here the -- the

I don't know

16

whether -- I'm having trouble applying the concepts of

17

unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation.

18

I can tell, this is something that the statute just

doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you

characterize that correctly as ambiguous.

kind of off the table.

As far as

It's just

22

MR. KINNAIRD:

I think it's ambiguous as

ambiguity arises because the requirements for which

there is imputation, status and residency, are matters

A minor does not decide whether or when a parent

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He does not

Well, can you give any

8

example -- the Government says you can't -- of an

9

instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just

10

status; where the status that the parents have is

11

automatically given to the child or, for that matter,

12

automatically taken away from the child?

13

MR. KINNAIRD:

Section 212(c) imputed

14

status, as the Ninth Circuit found.

15

the requirement there was not just for unrelinquished

16

domicile but lawful unrelinquished domicile, and,

17

therefore, they had to reach back to the period in which

18

the parent was an LPR --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The reason was that

But there -- there, you --

20

what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the

21

place, right?

22

That's imputing intent.

23

And that's -- that's an -- that's intent.

MR. KINNAIRD:

No, they also had to impute

24

lawfulness, which meant that the parent had to be an LPR

25

for that period or at least in some lawful status.

lawfulness from the parents.

10

MR. KINNAIRD:

That's right.

He -- well, he

would not have qualified for -- for a waiver of removal.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that

11

the point you're making is the statute is ambiguous in

12

the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from

13

making this imputation if it wants to.

14

clearly doesn't want to.

15

But the BIA

So, where does that leave you?

MR. KINNAIRD:

Well, I think if it is

16

ambiguous, then the BIA actually has to exercise its

17

discretion and grapple with that ambiguity.

18

one of the fundamental problems, as Justice --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that is

Well, are you saying that

20

the BIA needs to write an opinion that says now we are

21

doing Chevron step two analysis?

22

saying, that this is a matter of labeling?

23

MR. KINNAIRD:

Is that what you're

I don't think it's a matter

24

of -- of magic words, but what it has to do is actually

25

grapple with and recognize the ambiguity, at least in
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the alternative, and then exercise its discretion to say

2

if this is a permissible construction of the Act and

3

there's another permissible construction, which of the

4

two better serves the statutory purpose.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it doesn't have

6

to grapple with everything that's not there.

7

there are a lot of things that the statutes don't

8

address.

9

MR. KINNAIRD:

Agreed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

I mean,

It seems to me that

11

they don't have to grapple with everything that's there.

12

You just have to say this doesn't address it.

13

whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you,

14

loses.

15

MR. KINNAIRD:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So,

I don't think -You're saying:

We

17

think this law should allow -- should provide for this,

18

should be extended for this.

19

well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children

20

in one category but not in another category; so, the

21

issue's there; we don't know what they meant.

22

another thing if it's something that's totally not on

23

the table.

24

required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't

say the statute was ambiguous about that.

Alderson Reporting Company

You'd say it

1
2

doesn't have anything to do with it.
MR. KINNAIRD:

Well, that's right, Your

3

Honor, but I think the ambiguity arises here because the

4

matters in question are ones not within the capacity or

5

control of the minor, and that's been the traditional

6

basis on which the BIA has looked for imputation.

7

when you take into account --

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

In your -- your

9

argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who

10

never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a

11

cancellation of removal based on the parents' status.

12

MR. KINNAIRD:

I don't think that's right.

13

The Ninth Circuit did not address that, but I think the

14

better reading of the statute, even if (a)(1) is

15

somewhat ambiguous on that point, is that you have to be

16

an LPR in order to seek cancellation.

17

these durational requirements and the look-back to

18

status, there you do imputation.

19

And the reason is twofold.

And then for

One, section

20

212(c), which it replaced, was limited to LPRs.

The

21

second is that there is a separate subsection,

22

subsection (b), of that same statute.

23

it's in the addenda provided to the courts, but it is

24

cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent

25

resident aliens.

I don't believe

And the critical distinction between
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the two, besides differences in criteria, is that that

2

one authorizes adjustment of status as well as

3

cancellation.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What would --

So, if you're not an actual

12

13

when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to

14

have been there for 6 years?
MR. KINNAIRD:

15

Is the

I think if there's a

16

significant separation of that duration, I think there

17

would be a question about whether you have the

18

significant relationship between parent and child to

19

warrant imputation.

20

section 212(c), at least in two of the cases, they

21

imputed residency where the child was not actually

22

resident.

23

But it is true that under former

Alderson Reporting Company

that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is

And then that seemed like a status, a
Were you resettled in the other country or
That's his status, and then that's

MR. KINNAIRD:

That's right.

And the

10

resettlement doesn't have any element of intent to it.

11

So, it's not true that everything turns upon intent.

12

And I would also point out that, under

13

section (a)(1), it's not simply a requirement that there

14

have been some grant of LPR status at some point and

15

passage of 5 -- of 5 years.

16

"lawfully admitted for permanent residence" includes a

17

requirement that the status has not changed.

18

requires domiciliary intent because the BIA has

19

interpreted that phrase to mean that you can change your

20

status by intent, and in fact the Department of Homeland

21

Security has defended against cancellation claims on the

22

grounds that there was abandonment during a -- during

own reasons, which I don't think they've done adequately

16

as a matter of discretion.

17

But here, this is a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't it -- why isn't

it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and

19

in their decisions that the prior word was "domicile"

20

and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that

21

the word under the new statute is "residence" and the

22

child's residence is not necessarily the residence of

23

the parent?

24
25

That seems to me a perfectly valid reason.
MR. KINNAIRD:

Well, I wouldn't say that's

Chevron step two discretion.

But I think you also have

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to look to the fact that there was not only imputation

2

of domicile; it required lawfulness.

3

imputing domicile, they were also imputing residence.

a different word.

7

MR. KINNAIRD:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

by the agency.

12

MR. KINNAIRD:

Well, the rational basis

13

comes in if -- if there's ambiguity and they're

14

determining why -- if it's a permissible construction,

15

why it should be rejected or not.

14

permissible unless there's a rational basis in serving

So far as subsection (2) of the provision

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think there could be

circumstances in which imputation is appropriate when --

3

when the child is in the custody of the grandparent.

4

But I'm focusing on parents because that's how the cases

5

have been decided up to that point.

6

The BIA itself had said, prior to the

7

enactment of this statute, in the In re Ng case that --

That -- but

11

I can add to that a little bit, that in the section

12

212 cases, in which domicile was imputed, as the

13

Government recognizes, in at least two of those cases,

14

the child was not in the United States for a portion of

15

that time; and, therefore, necessarily those courts must

16

have been imputing not only domicile but residence.

17

that is necessarily the case because -- residence is an

18

element, a subset, of domicile --

9

to residence for particular purposes.

But as this Court

10

held in Holyfield, as the Government recognizes in a

11

domicile context, a child can be a domicile of a

12

jurisdiction in which they have never set foot.

13

legal presumption is that a child is -- takes the

domicile of the parent, and -- and residence is a

1

Congress would have been aware of that.

2

when it used the term "residence," it would have been

3

aware of that as a general proposition, and it would

4

have been aware that in the particular context of

5

section 212(c), imputation rule for relief in the

6

immigration laws, that use of the term "resident"

7

carries with it imputation.

8

And

I think that makes this -- so far as we're

9

concerned, that makes the use of the term "continuous

10

residence" in subsection (b) unambiguous and requires

11

imputation.

12

There's no reason to think, the Government concedes,

13

Congress was not trying to change the imputation rule

14

when it changed the terminology from -- from "domicile"

15

to "resident."

16

Congress would have been aware of this.

In fact, it's sort of perverse to say that

17

Congress had -- achieved that purpose, because it was

18

a -- this was a liberalizing change.

19

Congress -- it's quite clear from the statutory

20

background why Congress changed the language from 7

21

years' unrelinquished lawful domicile in the old 212(c)

22

to continuous residence after admission in any status in

23

-- in subsection (b) of the new statute -- was to

24

broaden the availability of relief.

25

The reason that

Congress was confronted with a split in the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

circuits on the interpretation of the old rule, as to

2

whether or not one could achieve unrelinquished

3

domicile -- lawful unrelinquished domicile while not in

4

an LPR status, because the BIA had taken the position

5

that for -- to have lawful domicile, you have to

6

lawfully intend to stay here permanently; you can't do

7

that if you're not an LPR.

8

And, therefore, Congress, confronting the

9

split on circuits -- because some courts had rejected

10

the BIA's view, Congress said, okay, we're going to put

11

in subsection (a) of the new statute a requirement of 5

12

years' LPR status.

JUSTICE ALITO:

intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also

18

attributed?

19

MS. KRUGER:

I think this goes back to the

20

answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier.

21

former section 212(c) had an explicit lawful status

22

requirement, which is the status of being a lawful

23

permanent resident, no court of appeals allowed

24

imputation from parent to child.

25

Their argument is a little bit more
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Where

convoluted than that.

It is that because domicile,

2

lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean

3

the ability to form a lawful intent to remain

4

permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit

5

said you could only form such an intent if you are a

6

lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the

7

Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR

8

status from parent to child.

9

I think the more straightforward way to read

10

the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the

11

intent to remain permanently in the United States from

12

parent to child, based in part on the parents'

13

establishment of a domicile, and based on the common law

14

rule that the child's domicile follows that of his

15

parents.

Counsel, in response

MS. KRUGER:

Well, in -- in addition to

22

discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they

23

also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's

24

imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run

25

around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR

status.

So, theoretically, you could have an individual

2

minor alien who's not eligible, who's inadmissible for

3

adjustment of status, who would nevertheless be accorded

4

a substantial benefit of that status without regard to

5

whether or not he could have received that status in

6

fact.
