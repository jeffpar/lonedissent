ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. HURST

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. HURST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Since 1984, whenever an -- a drug has

12

multiple FDA-approved uses, there has been a statutory

13

path for generic drugs to reach the market if there are

14

specific uses not covered by a patent.

15

no dispute that Novo's patent does not claim the use of

16

repaglinide when used alone, and that is "an approved

17

method" of using the drug.

18

statutory language exactly, Novo is arguing that in this

19

case, our counterclaim to correct their blocking use

20

code is thwarted by the fact that their patent does

21

claim a different approved use --

22

Here, there is

Even though that matches the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is the first -- is the

23

first approved, the drug itself -- they're not

24

claiming that, because that patent has expired, isn't

25

it?

MR. HURST:

That patent has long expired,

2

and they also had a patent using -- for the use of the

3

drug to treat diabetes through any method, and that

4

patent has long expired.

5

that Novo has is specifically limited to the use of

6

repaglinide in combination with metformin to treat

7

diabetes.

8

the market for admittedly noninfringing uses, which

9

occupy about 70 percent of the marketplace out there.

The only patent that's left

My client, Caraco, is attempting to get on

MR. HURST:

I believe that -- that -- if the

14

15

think that would be a correct statement if I understand

16

the way you are asking the question.

17

You are asking the question in a way that

18

suggests to me, by context, you're asking whether I cite

19

any Supreme Court precedent.

20

little bit different, because the context here in the

21

counterclaim is a situation where drugs routinely have

22

multiple and different, distinct uses.

23

context --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the context here is a

hundreds, probably thousands, of opinions, and you

3

them.

You cited quite a few, but you didn't cite all of

4

MR. HURST:

That's true.

That's true.

But

5

when a judge -- when a judge says to me that, you know,

6

you're going to lose this case because you did not cite

7

an applicable precedent, I'm going to hear that to mean

8

I didn't cite a specific particular case.

9

many ways to use the word "an" after the word "not"

There are

10

where it clearly does not mean "any."

11

"The prosecutor failed to get a conviction because she

12

did not prove an element of the offense."

13

on my way to the party because I failed to make a turn."

14

"My cake fell because I did not include an ingredient."

15

So, the context speaks volumes in terms of whether or

16

not "an" means "any" in any particular context.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For instance:

"I got lost

before, and that's the second one, that -- your -- your

MR. HURST:

5

whether I have a remedy in -- for this particular

6

counterclaim.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's true, but it -- but

8

if you have alternative remedies, I am not terribly

MR. HURST:

I don't have any good remedies

14

existing law, because the FDA's position is that their

15

role with respect to patents is purely ministerial.

That has been upheld for about a decade now, including

17

multiple courts of appeals, the Federal Circuit, and the

certification, and Novo sues you for infringement.

5

Could you not defend the infringement action on the

6

ground that your use of the -- of the drug was not in --

7

8

MR. HURST:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. HURST:

I could not.
Why -- why is that?

Because there's two paths that

I went through the other route, paragraph IV.

not -- FDA does not allow you to carve out any portion

17

So, the circumstance that you just described, I would --

way for me to get on the market is to invalidate the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about the fact

that the FDA, and not the patent holders, were drafting

the use codes at the time this legislation passed?

10

MR. HURST:

Justice Ginsburg, that is

11

incorrect; your timing is incorrect.

12

2003, the FDA was authoring the use codes based on

13

information from the brand companies; but after June of

4

MR. HURST:

I think the short answer is yes;

5

the FDA has always done their very best to not get

anywhere near the patents.

7

essentially.

8

there was a notice and rule -- I mean -- I'm sorry -- a

notice-and-comment rulemaking about this, and eventually

They don't do patents,

And so, they decided -- and there was a --

10

decided to make -- to have the brands submit the use

codes.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would it suffice in the

13

description just to give a cross-reference to the

14

patent, to say the use of this drug is described in

15

patent claim number 43?

16

MR. HURST:

It -- it would not be

17

sufficient, because the way -- the whole purpose of the

18

use code is to administer section (viii).

19

FDA does is they take the use code, and they match it up

20

with the label, and then the generic gets to carve out

But you do not -- Congress did not enact a

lawsuit to fix that.

20

incentive in the world to ensure that they don't make

But the brand company has every

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

10

12
13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to pick up with Justice Kennedy's

14

question about FDA and writing use codes.

The first

15

thing I'd point out is that before 2003, although FDA

16

wrote the actual text that went in the Orange Book, it

17

was relying on information submitted on a sort of

18

free-form declaration by the -- by the brand.

19

brand was still kind of -- excuse me -- calling the

20

shots in that -- in that respect.

So, the

21

But the -- but the more important point is

22

that FDA doesn't have the resources or expertise or --

23

and to engage in the substantive patent evaluations

24

that, that would be required under a theory where you

25

would go sue the FDA if you had a problem with this.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

But more to the point --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Horwich, do we -- do

3

we know what FDA's position is in this case?

4

position you're presenting the position of the FDA?

5

MR. HORWICH:

We -- yes.

Is the

We represent the

6

United States here; and so, we -- we speak -- we speak

7

for FDA and the other agencies of the government who are

8

very concerned here about the competition law effects of

9

this.

10

I mean, that's -- that's in some ways the bigger

story here.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

that mean exactly, that you represent?

13

might be a case where we would give the agency

14

deference, except the agency's name doesn't appear on

15

the brief.

16

Well, Mr. Horwich, what does
I mean, this

So, should we give you any deference?
MR. HORWICH:

Well, the -- the names on the

17

briefs I think should not be a guide to the deference

18

question.

19

the sense -- because what we're construing here, or what

20

the Court is construing here, is the counterclaim

21

provision, which is a Federal cause of action.

22

the Adams Fruit decision of this Court would say that

23

agencies don't get deference in defining the terms of a

24

Federal cause of action.

25

But we're not really claiming deference in

And so,

And we do think that -- we do think that

2

were engaged in a dialogue in 2003.

3

wouldn't label that deference, I would -- I would

4

probably characterize it more accurately as Congress

5

building upon what FDA had done in constructing its

patent information regulation and Congress saying we

12

anything to ensure the accuracy of the code?

Well, the statute -- well, let

14

me start with the basic that the statute envisions that

15

there will be carve-outs.

16

behind section (viii).

That's the whole principle

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

And so, FDA says, well, we

19

need to know when a generic has made a valid carve-out.

20

And FDA says -- and FDA goes through this in the 2003

21

rulemaking -- if you read through the preamble, there's

22

more detail.

23

choices.

24
25

But the short of it is FDA has three

they've carved out, but that doesn't really work because

principle of getting patent issues resolved before

5

regulatory approval.

6

FDA could, as the second alternative, try to

7

evaluate patents itself.

But nowhere else in the

8

statute is FDA given any role in the substantive

9

evaluation of patents, and with good reason.

This Court

10

has said in its Markman decision that claim construction

11

of patents is a question of law.

13

ultimately this Court; it's not FDA.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. HORWICH:

JUSTICE ALITO:

The actors in our

If a patent holder -So, the third choice -If a patent holder writes a

use code that is ridiculously, totally, unreasonably

18

broad, is there anything that FDA can do about that?

19

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think the problem,

20

Justice Alito, is that from FDA's point of view, it's a

21

very slippery slope, because as soon as FDA starts

22

undertaking criticism of a use code, its effective --

23

the only basis for criticizing it is looking at the

24

patent.

25

Court shouldn't be fooled that all cases are going to be

Now, this may be a very easy case, but the

easy.

And if FDA here were to go in and said, well,

2

this doesn't look like it's the same as the claim of the

3

patent, in the next case, where it's a more difficult

4

question, where there may be some very good faith

5

dispute between the parties about the very meaning of

6

the patent, FDA is going to have to make a decision one

7

way or the other --

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. HORWICH:

10

Well, what about after --

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- and it's going to get sued.
What about after there has

11

been litigation and a court has decided that a use code

12

that was written in a particular case was totally

13

unreasonable?

14

writing of that was in violation of some provision of

15

the -- of the Food and Drug Act or FDA regulations and

16

that there would be some sanction against the company

17

that did that?

18

Does that -- does that mean that the

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think the -- I think

19

the only posture in which a court would actually look at

20

a use code and evaluate it is under the counterclaim.

21

There's -- the court would not be looking at a use code

22

under traditional paragraph IV litigation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about an APA

3

action against the FDA for relying on the use code?

4

Couldn't that be challenged as arbitrary and capricious?

5

MR. HORWICH:

Well, it seems to me that --

6

that that challenge would fail because FDA has made a

7

reasonable construction of the statute, that its role is

8

ministerial.

9

evaluation of patents because the statute doesn't

10

envision that.

11

It does not engage in substantive

So, FDA would win that suit.

On the other hand, if in -- going back to my

12

answer to Justice Kennedy, if we're talking about kind

13

of the second scenario where FDA does engage in

14

substantive patent review, yes, FDA could get sued.

15

the problem with that is that FDA is going to get sued

16

in an APA suit; the real parties in interest are going

17

to be the generic and the brand.

It's certainly possible in a

appropriate.

Is merely the use of a label that's identical

infringement or is it an infringement of the underlying

It would be inducement of

infringement to sell a product with labeling that

suggests that the product be used for a patented method

of use.

Okay.

So, tell us how a

The counterclaim is designed

precisely to get out of the quandary, because what it

says is the paragraph IV litigation here, the choice

8

between infringement and noninfringement, is a false

9

choice, because if the counterclaim prevails and the use

away because Caraco is going to want to go proceed

20

In 2003, FDA decided to turn it over to the

industry.

And it said in this rulemaking -- you've

22

heard a little bit about the rulemaking but not what FDA

23

actually said.

24

I'm quoting by the way from page 19a of the reply brief.

25

This is 68 Federal Register page 36,682.

It said to this:

then the generic industry, during this very rulemaking,

6

made all of the arguments that Mr. Hurst has made today,

7

said we should have more of a challenge, we should have

8

litigation and so forth.

17

any more rapidly.

MR. PERRY:

MR. PERRY:

MR. PERRY:

That's right.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why would anybody have

3

created this counterclaim to fix the patent number and

4

the expiration date when that can be done by way of a

5

defense to a patent claim?

6

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, it's important to

7

remember the counterclaim is only a delisting provision.

8

It was -- it is a very narrow provision.

3

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, what the FTC report

4

explained was that certain branded companies near the

5

expiration of the listed patent would come in and file a

6

second patent in the Orange Book, even though it was not

7

properly listed, it didn't fit within section 505(b) in

8

the listing requirements, solely for the purpose of

getting a second 30-month stay, essentially to box out

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not listed simply because the number

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, the usual case is

13

it's not listed because it doesn't fit.

The most famous

14

example, the Buspar case, they claimed a metabolite

15

rather than the drug substance, and that wasn't a proper

16

listing for that reason.

17

The correction language, which does come out

18

of the other bill, the alternative bill, and we do think

19

is an artifact, is the language we've used, is there to

20

give flexibility to courts.

21

an improperly listed patent, then a court has more

22

flexibility than simply delisting.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PERRY:

Yes, Your Honor, and --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, why would we

3

give a procedure to an adversary to fix the number when

4

the brand manufacturer is going to fix it as soon as

5

it's alerted to the problem?

6

MR. PERRY:

Because, Your Honor, if the

7

generic raises a counterclaim, if it's delisted, the

8

generic gets no more 180-day marketing exclusivity stay

9

at the end of the ANDA process.

If it's corrected to a

10

different patent number, the generic would still have

11

its 180-day exclusivity.

12

for the generic to bring the counterclaim for a

13

correction if that's the appropriate remedy.

So, there's every incentive

MR. PERRY:

I mean, the minute that

That could be corrected

through this counterclaim.

But, again, that's worlds

17

away from this use code challenge, which is really what

18

Caraco wants to bring, something that wasn't on

19

Congress's radar screen because FDA wrote the use codes

20

at that point.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, let's -- let's

22

assume -- because I now take from your earlier

23

conversation with Justice Breyer that you're saying the

25

that we claimed was the combination use of the drug,

2

that's wrong here is the indication that the FDA has

MR. PERRY:

6

So, that's not even wrong because you had no

That -- the indication is

correct.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me -- what this

8

means practically, I believe, is that until your patent

9

expires, no generic can come in with a use that's

10

different than yours because they're going to be boxed

11

out by this indication, this overbroad indication.

12

you actually think that that's what Congress intended?

13

I thought, with claim IV and section (viii), that what

14

Congress intended was to ensure that drugs got onto the

15

market as quickly as possible.

MR. PERRY:

Do

Your Honor, that argument was

17

made to FDA by the generic industry in the 1994

irrelevant patent.

4

this makes -- this is worse from the generic

manufacturer doesn't even have a defense in an

And the question is why we should

MR. PERRY:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In some respects,

Your Honor -So, why should we think that

10

the Congress that really cared about the result in Mylan

11

does not care about this?

12

MR. PERRY:

Mylan, in the response, gives

13

the generic a one-shot remedy, and you're out of it

I read to the Court some of the ones that FDA itself

And it's a black-and-white decision.

It's

of the reply brief, where the FDA said increased

2

litigation over use codes -- patent listings -- would

3

not assure faster generic entry because you'd spend

4

years and years, as we all have, litigating these very

5

issues.

6

So, the Congress hadn't focused on this,

7

which it never did.

There's not one word in the

8

thousands and thousands of pages of legislative history

9

about use codes.

Had it focused on this, it would never

10

have gone this way because it didn't need to.

11

it did have the broader bill, S. 812, it failed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES F. HURST

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17

MR. HURST:

18

I'd like to start by asking the Court, if I

19

can, to turn to the Joint Appendix, second volume, 484.

20

And I want to address two issues:

21

use code is disconnected from the patent itself and it

22

-- it may relate to the indication regardless of what

23

the patent says, and whether or not the information is

24

being submitted under subsection (b) and (c).

25

Thank you.

the argument that the

If you're at 484, this form went through

2

the counterclaim.

Submitted" -- that -- that is a -- this carries out the

4

regulation 314.53, entitled "Submission of patent

5

information."

6

The title, "Patent Information

Now look at right below those two boxes.

7

What does it say -- how does it say the information is

8

being submitted?

9

following is provided in accordance with section

This is a form Novo signed.

"The

10

505(b)" -- that's 355(b) and -- "(c) of the Federal

11

Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."

12

Moreover, when the FDA issued this patent

13

submission regulation in its final rule, it cited 505 as

14

its legal authority.

15

It cited -- and it specifically called out subsections

16

(b) and (c).

17
18
19
20
21

That's at 28J of the Blue Book.

So, this is a regulation that was enacted
prior to the enactment of the counterclaim.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And now --

And what do you say about

the -- the section cited by -- by your colleague?
MR. HURST:

We address -- he's citing

22

something the FDA said in 2007.

And if you actually

23

read it, we cited it -- we addressed this in our briefs.

24

It actually says our -- our legal authority for doing

25

this was explained fully in 2003.

And in 2003, the FDA

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

cites 505.

2

Can I turn you quickly to 487 now?

This

3

addresses quite specifically this notion that the

4

indication can be used even if it's disconnected from

5

the patent.

6

and Justice Breyer read this before.

7

the appendix.

8

required to, quote, "the description of the patented

9

method of use as required for publication."

10

4.2b.

Remember what the regulation says,
It's at 127a of

But the regulation says that the brand is

They're

supposed to provide that information.

11

And look what the actual instruction says.

12

It could not be more clear.

13

"The answer to this question" -- this is where the brand

14

supplies the use code -- "The answer to this question

15

will be what FDA uses to create a 'use code' for Orange

16

Book publication.

17

use patent that claims the approved indication or use"

18

-- it depends on what the patent claims -- "of a drug

19

product."

20

4.2b, bottom right side.

The use code designates a method of

And then it goes on to explain why you need

21

to do that:

"Each approved use claimed by the patent

22

should be separately identified in this section and

23

contain adequate information" -- this refers to section

24

(viii) -- "adequate information to assist 505(b)(2) and

25

ANDA applicants" -- that's us -- "in determining whether

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

a listed method of use patent claims a use for which the

2

ANDA applicant is not seeking."

3

situation we are facing.

4

That is precisely the

We have offered a construction of this

5

statute that is fully consistent with its text, its

6

structure, and its purpose.

7

reading of the statute that carries out congressional

8

intent in terms of trying to prevent situations where

9

incorrect patent information is unfairly delaying

10

And it really is the only

generic competition.

11

Up to this point right now, Novo has still

12

failed to identify any reason why anybody in Congress

13

would want the system to work as Novo posits, where the

14

brand company gets to supply an overbroad use code,

15

without judicial review, without agency review, that

16

blocks admittedly noninfringing products from the

17

marketplace.

18

addition of the correction remedy, that would not be in

19

there if this was not designed to address use codes,

20

because that's the only thing that can be corrected

21

without remedy.

22
23

And I -- and I submit that given the
