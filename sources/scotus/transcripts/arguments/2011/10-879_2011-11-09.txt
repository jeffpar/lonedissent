Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Congress enacted the Locomotive Inspection

12

Act to ensure the safety of locomotives in use on

13

railroad lines, not to regulate hazards to mechanics

14

conducting repairs of locomotives.

15

The doctrine of implied --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, what do you -- what

17

do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case,

18

regulating the lights that railroads had to have,

19

locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those

20

lights had to differ when the railroad was in use?

21

MR. FREDERICK:

That was actually I think

22

pursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor,

23

if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken.

24

behind the safety in use regulation that this Court

25

construed in Napier was to ensure that locomotives were
3
Alderson Reporting Company

And the principle

Official

1

safe for fit use on the line.

2

consistent construction both in the ICC's statement that

3

it made in 1922 and in this Court's post-Napier --

4

And that was the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure I

5

understand.

It prescribed different lights when the --

6

when the locomotive was in the yard.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

with safety in use.

Yes.
That had nothing to do

It had to do with safety in repair.

MR. FREDERICK:

Our position is that it was

11

not pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the

12

ICC promulgated that rule.

13

numerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect

14

to different aspects of the train at different points in

15

time, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to

16

address a very specific problem, which was boilers

17

exploding on the line when the train was in operation.

18

And that is the consistent way that the ICC, and

19

subsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has

20

construed the Act.

21

As the Court has said in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

reasoning in the Ray case.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Distinguish for me our

I'm sorry.
Distinguish for me the

difference in the Ray case, that had to do with
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

navigation and where we held that the agency, in

2

ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design

3

completely, whether in repair or not.

4

why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

So, how do we --

Well, of course in Ray you

6

addressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the

7

Port and Waterway Safety Act.

8

v. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in

9

terms of design in a statute that also specifically

And in the United States

10

included the word "repair and maintenance," which is

11

absent here.

12

But what the Court was getting at in Ray was

13

to ensure that States were not using their law to

14

interfere with the design of equipment.

15

was for --

16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Of course, that

That's the argument

here, which is --

18

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- once you regulate

20

what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're

21

interfering with what available components there are for

22

locomotives.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

If I could make two points

24

about that, Justice Sotomayor.

25

correct.

That's not actually

The first is anything that the Court might
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think about design does not impair our failure-to-

2

warrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design

3

of a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its

4

safe use.

5
6

But to the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you're giving up all

of your other claims?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

My second argument is

8

that the design claim here involves repair work or

9

problems uniquely; it does not include or intrude on the

10

fitness for service standard that this Court announced

11

in Napier or that has consistently been applied.

12

asbestos harms that the repair workers here faced are

13

unique to the repair process, where they are scraping

14

off the --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Well, but, counsel,

16

looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said

17

was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of

18

equipment to be used on locomotives, right?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, but on --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, this is

21

equipment that was used in locomotives.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice,

23

it also says on page 612 that the power delegated by

24

Congress is to determine fitness for service.

25

words about the -6
Alderson Reporting Company

So, the

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but that's the

2

same -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that,

3

fitness for service.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

No, it's not --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't say

6

something that's going to cause harm while it's actually

7

being used.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

But, Mr. Chief Justice, the

principle here is to ensure that the locomotives, when

10

they are outside the repair yard and are on the

11

locomotive -- on the railroad line, are -- are safe to

12

operate.

13

That standard in Napier had -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why does it

14

depend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to

15

operate, right?

16

going to be used.

To be used, whether -- whether it's
If you have a --

17

MR. FREDERICK:

Not to be broken down.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you have a boiler

19

that's going to be used, that's within the power that

20

was confirmed.

21

Justice Brandeis said.

22

It's not merely to inspect as, again,

MR. FREDERICK:

But the point here is that

23

it is not to be broken down.

And the locomotive repair

24

workers here face unique hazards in repairing

25

locomotives whose safety standards are to ensure that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

they work properly on the railroad line, not when

2

they're being taken apart and repaired.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That they --

Well, I guess your

4

argument isn't limited to being taken apart.

5

argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos

6

doesn't come out during use; right?

7
8

MR. FREDERICK:

11
12
13

That's absolutely correct.

That's why this is --

9
10

Your

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how do we know

that -MR. FREDERICK:

-- a unique hazard faced by

the repair workers.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but if there's

14

an accident or something, does the asbestos come out

15

during the use of the locomotive?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

If it did, it would be

17

covered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety

18

standard, and that would be covered by Federal law.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you would say once

20

there's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's

21

no longer in use.

I suppose that's what you'd say.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, and --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's unrealistic, but

24
25

that's what you'd say.
MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Well, it's governed by

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a different statute, which is found at 49 U.S.C. 303.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's the old

3

insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car,

4

you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being

5

used as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance

6

doesn't cover it.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, if I could finish my

8

answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice,

9

there's a specific statute on that point, and it

10

predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided

11

that when there was a crippled locomotive, the railroad

12

did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the

13

crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it

14

specifically said if a worker was injured during that

15

process, the railroad would face liability.

16

Our point here is that the Locomotive

17

Inspection Act's field should be construed narrowly

18

because in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively

19

legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a

20

conflict pre-emption regime in which if a State had a

21

rule in place, that rule would be permitted to survive

22

unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued

23

a regulation.

24

asbestos.

25

And there has never been a regulation on

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm concerned about I

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think is the same thing that the Chief Justice

2

mentioned, the particular language in Napier.

3

whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier

4

were decided again, it did come out the way it did.

5

Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a

6

long time.

7

And

And

And the argument is made in Napier that this

8

particular State regulation is aimed at preventing

9

sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe,

10

and, therefore, it's not pre-empted.

And the answer to

11

that was not sickness and disease are an object of the

12

statute, too.

13

statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment

14

of locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted.

The answer was the Federal and the State

Now, how could we come out in your favor

15
16

without overturning what seems to be that key sentence

17

in Napier?

18

That is the problem that's bothering me.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, first, I would urge

19

you not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice

20

Brandeis is obviously --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

Okay.

That's a --

22

the problem with (a) is that it's been followed and

23

followed and followed and followed, and really read for

24

all its worth, and so forth.

25

to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence?

So -- so one question is,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That's (a).

2

Okay?

What's (b)?

MR. FREDERICK:

(B) is that he was

3

addressing himself to fitness for service standards on

4

the line, the Wisconsin and Georgia statutes at issue

5

there purporting to regulate what the locomotive could

6

do while it was in operation on the line.

7

what the claims in this case entail.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's not

Not -- now, is there any

way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a

10

reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your

11

case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers'

12

way of dealing with their equipment?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

What is that?
First is if you accept our

19

The warning claims are not -- do not affect the

Secondly, the design claims here go to the

2

That is a distinct kind of design claim that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let me make sure I

2

understand you.

3

to issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer

4

use these asbestos-containing brakes because of the

5

hazards in the repair shop, do you think the Secretary

6

could not do that under the statute?

7

Is -- if the Secretary tomorrow decided

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Absolutely --

8

absolutely can do that under the Federal Rail Safety

9

Act, which, again, empowers the Secretary.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10
11

12

But the Secretary cannot do

Is that the idea?

MR. FREDERICK:

It -- it very well could

13

because it's a fitness for service standard.

14

always -- and if you look at its regulations, in parts

15

229 and part 230 of 49 C.F.R., it always issues these

16

regulations under both authorities because the FRSA

17

expanded it.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it

Okay, then I'm a little bit

19

lost.

20

under LIA, L-I-A, then isn't it in the scope of

21

regulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of

22

what's pre-empted?

23

If the Secretary can issue such a regulation

MR. FREDERICK:

It would have to do so under

24

the B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was

25

another Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

have to make a finding that to make that regulation that

2

you posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid

3

unnecessary peril to life or limb.

4

Court struck down the ICC's attempt to issue a

5

regulation on a particular type of equipment because the

6

ICC could not make that demonstration.

7

In that case, the

So, in the current world, the FRA would

8

regulate under the FRSA; it would not regulate under the

9

LIA because under this Court's jurisprudence it is a

10

harder standard to meet to implement a regulatory

11

standard.

12

That's our point.
The regulatory field here does not need to

13

be read as expansively as the other side posits, because

14

the FRA has all the authority it needs under the FRSA if

15

it chooses to promulgate those rules, and it has not

16

chosen to promulgate those rules.

17

conflict pre-emption to displace any State rule, but

18

what they are seeking to do is to take the doctrine of

19

implied field pre-emption, gain immunity from State law

20

liability, and not be subject to any Federal rules.

21

it's that proposition that is an extraordinary

22

proposition of implied field pre-emption.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

it please the Court:
I think it's helpful in this case to try to

3

separate out the field pre-emption issues from the

4

conflict pre-emption issues.

5

the only issue properly presented in this case is

6

whether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field

7

pre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not

8

because they arise from injuries that occurred when the

9

locomotive was not in use.

10

In the Government's view,

Now, Respondent would have the Court expand

11

the field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any

12

claim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment,

13

regardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive

14

was in use at the time injury occurred.

15

But it doesn't make sense to --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you think that one of

17

the purposes of the legislation, which everybody

18

understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be

19

able to construct their engines without having to worry

20

about a variety of different State requirements?

21

Railroading is a national transportation industry, and

22

whoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this

23

way, it's going to be okay.

24

MS. HARRINGTON:

Absolutely.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you're saying it won't

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be okay because, although every State may have -- every

2

State's requirements may be pre-empted when the -- when

3

the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have

4

different requirements with respect to what the design

5

has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's

6

being repaired.

7

purpose of the Act.

8
9

I think that truly frustrates the

MS. HARRINGTON:
what you're saying.

I completely agree with

And -- and I'm sorry if you

10

missed -- if we didn't state our position clearly in our

11

brief.

12

requirements that go to the design, construction, or

13

materials on a locomotive that will be used, if those

14

requirements are directed at the repair shop, then they

15

would be conflict pre-empted.

16

Our view is that those kinds of requirements --

But they wouldn't fall within the field

17

that's governed by LIA because the LIA's substantive

18

standard of care only applies to locomotives that are in

19

use.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not -- I'm not

21

concerned about conflict pre-emption.

22

about State requirements that conflict with the Federal.

23

I'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict

24

with each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to

25

all 50 States instead of looking to the Secretary here,
18
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not concerned

1

which says your engine is safe if you do this.

2

you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume

3

that.

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

No, I'm sorry.

And

And let me

5

clarify.

I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.

6

our view, what the conflict is, is not a conflict with a

7

Federal rule saying you have to use this piece of

8

equipment and you can't use that piece of equipment.

9

The conflict is with one of the purposes of the LIA,

10

which is that the Federal Government be the only

11

regulator of equipment that will be used on a

12

locomotive.

13

In

And so, what that means is if -- if the

14

Federal Government hasn't spoken as to whether piece of

15

equipment A can be used on a locomotive, that means that

16

it can be, that the manufacturers know that it's okay.

17

And if you have a State rule that would have the effect

18

of dictating the equipment that can be used on a

19

locomotive, that would conflict with the single

20

regulator objective of the LIA.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:
How do you do it?

So, what's the difference

22

then?

How do you -- how do you --

23

what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's

24

going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in

2

runs on the railroad?

3
4

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think it depends on

what the warning claim is.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, give me an example.

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, under the -- under

7

the Respondents' -- under the Respondents' view of the

8

field that's pre-empted, a State could not regulate the

9

disposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive

10

during their repair process, even though --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does that have anything to

12

do with this case, the removal, never further -- no

13

further use of a bit of a locomotive?

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

No.

But also --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Okay.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Also, in Respondents' view

16
17

Let's get to

this case.

18

a State could not regulate workplace hazards, such as by

19

requiring that workers wear goggles or masks.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I didn't know anybody

21

denied that, that the State could regulate the repair

22

shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed

23

require what equipment workers have to have.

24

we're only talking about those rules of State law that

25

would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of
20
Alderson Reporting Company

I thought

Official

1

design in his locomotive.

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes, but when you're --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's what I'm having

4

trouble thinking of one that would only affect repair

5

shops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of

6

equipment that you could stick on the front of it, and

7

it is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and

8

before it goes back on the line, you take it off and put

9

it in a locker.

And -- but, you know, the more I

10

thought along those lines, I thought I'm getting into

11

outer space.

12

This isn't reality.
MS. HARRINGTON:

No.

So -I think you could --

13

I'm sorry.

14

State says when a locomotive comes into a repair shop,

15

the railroad or the repair shop has to attach a certain

16

kind of clamp on the wheels, a certain kind of brake,

17

that makes sure that the locomotive won't move while

18

it's in the repair shop.

19

the locomotive, you take them off, and the locomotive

20

goes back --

21
22
23

I think you could imagine a world where a

And when you're done repairing

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, does that

have more than theoretical value in this case?
MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think in this case

24

the claims that we say would not be conflict pre-empted

25

or within the field are claims -- are the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

failure-to-warn claims.

2

actually issues the warning that would be required I

3

think is a question that could be worked out as the case

4

proceeds.

5

Now, how a manufacturer

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the manufacturer is

6

really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is

7

this failure-to-warn claim?

8

MS. HARRINGTON:

9

Well, again, I think it

depends how the warning is issued.

You could require

10

that the manufacturer tell the purchaser of the products

11

to pass the warning along, to post warnings in a repair

12

shop.

You know, there --

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How -- they can't

control whether they do or don't.
MS. HARRINGTON:

15

They could require it

16

contractually through the sale of the products.

17

those sorts of detailed issues would be things that

18

would be worked out on remand in this case.

19

I think

Again, in our view, the only question

20

squarely presented in this case is the field pre-emption

21

question.

22

And -JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, on that question, Ms.

23

Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your

24

regulatory authority and whether you think you have the

25

capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

workers on railway equipment.

2

under the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes

3

because we're afraid that these brakes injure the -- the

4

guys in the roundhouse.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

So, can you issue a rule

No.

The LIA -- the

6

standard of care under the LIA only goes to whether a

7

locomotive is safe for use, and that is also the limit

8

of the FRA's regulatory authority.

9

United States v. B&O, addressed that issue.

This Court, in the
The ICC at

10

the time had issued a regulation requiring a certain

11

kind of reverse gear instead of a different kind of

12

reverse gear.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what -- what

14

self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that "safe

15

for use" does not include safe for use when it's being

16

repaired.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

Because the statute says

18

safe for use on -- safe for use on the line.

19

for use on lines of interstate commerce.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's safe

But this does seem a very

21

limiting construction.

Napier seems to have a broader

22

construction, and if I read some of your history right,

23

you've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory

24

authority in the past.

25

MS. SMITH:

So, why this narrow view?
I'm not aware that we've taken a
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

broader view of our regulatory authority under the LIA.

2

In Napier, again, what's important to remember is that

3

the State statutes at issue applied only to locomotives

4

that were in use.

5

-- any broad statements that were made in Napier and

6

read them as applying outside that context.

7

And so, I think it's hard to take any

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but if you're

talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on

9

railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can

Well, then -- well,

This is

5

something you can fix in either place.

It's covered

6

while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under

8

shop?

9

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, if it's -- if the

10

fact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to

11

use, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it

12

while it's in use.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, then it's not

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

Mr. Hacker.

MR. HACKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

The LIA as construed by this Court in

7

Napier, in particular in the passage quoted by Justice

8

Breyer, delegates to the DOT the exclusive authority to

9

determine the design and the materials of locomotive

10

equipment.

Petitioners, however, argue that States in

11

fact may dictate locomotive design and materials so long

12

as they do so for some purpose other than safety of use

13

on the line.

14

But, again, in the passage Justice Breyer

15

pointed out, Napier holds that LIA pre-emption is not

16

about the purpose of locomotive equipment regulation and

17

is not about the geographic location of the locomotive

18

on or off the line when the regulation is enforced.

19

Justice Sotomayor pointed out in the earlier argument

20

this morning, regulatory power is broader than purpose.

21

As Napier says, under the LIA, pre-emption is about the

22

locomotive equipment itself, what Napier referred to as

23

the physical elements of the locomotive.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

As

Well, Mr. Hacker, could you

explain to me -- I wasn't sure reading your brief
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether you agree or disagree with the Government's

2

point that the agency cannot, under the LIA, issue the

3

kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no

4

asbestos-containing brakes because of the danger that

5

those brakes pose to the repairmen.

6

MR. HACKER:

I -- frankly, I would have

7

thought it possible.

I would have to defer to the -- to

8

the DOT's view.

9

within DOT's power under the LIA to say a locomotive is

It seems to me it would have been

10

not safe to operate if it can't be safely repaired.

11

Because there's no point in having a locomotive ready to

12

go on the line if it -- as soon as it comes off the line

13

with a problem it's going to injure those who work with

14

it.

15

the proposition we have now --

16

But we don't need to assert that position to defend

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is that?

If they

17

are right as to the scope of their authority -- and

18

maybe they're not right, but if they are right about the

19

scope of their authority, why doesn't it follow that

20

these claims would not be field pre-empted; might be

21

conflict pre-empted but would not be field pre-empted

22

because we're no longer in the field?

23

MR. HACKER:

Because the field is not --

24

it's not about the repair shop versus not the repair

25

shop.

The field is the physical elements of the

It's design for use.

MR. HACKER:

But the statute -- the reason

20

the statute gives power to the DOT is to ensure that

21

locomotives are safe for use on the line.

22

to accomplish that objective, the power they have is

plenary over the design itself.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, I know it's use on

obvious extension of the line.

We don't disagree with that.
Why would their law be

pre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad

knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since

23

it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has

24

to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker

25

how they can overcome them.

under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does

2

It was a way of saying you can't use that design

3

lawfully unless you have the following type of warning.

4

If you -- you can't assume away the design aspect of it

because it still turns on -- it's a State conditioning

7

The LIA and the FRSA and SCAA and OSHA all

together solved this problem by -- and FELA, solved this

problem by saying it is the repair shop's responsibility

10

to ensure the safety of workers.

11

absolutely clear -- Ms. Harrington was incorrect when

12

she said:

have the power to impose workplace conditions to protect

14

employee safety in the repair shop.

We don't believe that repair shop -- States

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

We are not, to be

They do.

But -- no, no, no.

That

16

argument would prevent States doing what they can do

17

lawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because

18

with any given repair, with many of them, you could say,

well, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the

8

9

But what they can't do is tell manufacturers

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What would apply to the

10

repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use,

11

I suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the

12

manufacturer that although the engine he has

13

manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the

14

Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer:

15

Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have

16

to give you warning.

that that's what the statute means as applied, at least

a law like that that's directed at a particular type of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me ask this question:

Is it your position that the -- that the engine is as

3

much in use when it's in the shop as when it's running

4

5

Is that your position?

MR. HACKER:

We don't have a problem with

6

that position.

7

because we don't believe you have to establish that it's

8

in use in the repair shop to establish that the

9

pre-emption described by Justice Brandeis in Napier

10

controls, because the pre-emption he was describing

11

was -- the regulatory authority was over the equipment

12

itself which is the same exact equipment.

13

a locomotive designed a particular way doesn't change

14

when it enters the repair shop; so, it's designed to be

15

fit for service.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A railroad --

Well, the reason it seems

17

to me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50

18

different State regulations for the kind of gloves and

19

things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's

20

running the train on the track.

21

seems to me it would help you to say that the shop was

22

the same, but you seem to say the shop was different.

The implication would be,

I don't think that makes any sense at all.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID C. FREDERICK
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

Manufacturers clearly have

3

the best information about the dangerous aspects of

4

their products, and they issue warnings and instructions

5

in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that

6

persons working on their equipment are going to know the

7

special hazards.

8

those manufacturers from liability where they have the

9

best information to ensure that repair workers are not

10
11

It doesn't make sense to inoculate

going to be exposed to risks.
With respect to the point about being on the

12

line, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection

13

Act was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also safe

14

to operate on the railroad line.

15

regulations -- and this is well established -- yard

16

limits are drawn outside the bowl where switching

17

operations and repair operations occur, so that

18

everybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies

19

and where it doesn't.

20

Under the

And the reason why the LIA has had this kind

21

of history with respect to repair work goes to the

22

history of -- behind this Court's recognition of the

23

commerce power.

24

settled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate

25

activities, which are peculiar to repair yards.

Up until the New Deal era, it was well

44
Alderson Reporting Company

And so,

Official

1

this Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid

2

1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an

3

FELA claim because his work was not in interstate

4

commerce; it was only in intrastate commerce.

5

is why the ICC throughout this entire period never

6

devoted regulations to repair yards, because this

7

Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal

8

regulatory activity for that.

9

And that

So, if you look at this case from an

10

historical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear

11

that the full parameters of the way the Court would

12

explain Napier would be the same, because its approach

13

to field pre-emption is so different after the New Deal

14

era than it was before the New Deal era.

15

also why when this Court looks at regulatory

16

implications of common law claims, it has had no problem

17

allowing State law to have design defect claims with

18

respect to planes, cars, motorboats, and trucks, even

19

though the implications of a State law claim might find

20

liability for the insufficiency of the design imposing

21

an unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to

22

that risk with respect to that interstate modality.

23

And that is

There's no reason why you have to have a

24

broad and expansive view of the field here because

25

Congress subsequently has enacted in this very area to

2

deems that authority appropriate.

3

Government says --

4

And as the Federal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it knows -- it

5

knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85

6

years, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive

7

effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's

8

free to do that, too.

9

MR. FREDERICK:

It did so, though, Your

10

Honor in 49 U.S.C. 20106, where it said that unless and

11

until the Federal Government issues a regulation in a

12

particular field, the States are allowed to have their

13

rule be in effect.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was -- that was

15

the Safety Act, and they didn't amend the Locomotive

16

Act.

put that clause in it.

18

The Locomotive Act is what it was, and they didn't

MR. FREDERICK:

But that's why, Justice

19

Ginsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define

20

the scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an

21

historical context that we just don't live in anymore.

22

And there's no reason to give manufacturers a complete

23

pass from liability when they have the best information

24

to advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how

25

to work on their equipment in a safe way without
