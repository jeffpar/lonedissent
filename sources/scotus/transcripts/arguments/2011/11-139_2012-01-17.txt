ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The disputed question in this case concerns

12

the meaning of the phrase "omits from gross income an

13

amount properly includible therein" in 26

14

U.S.C. 6501(e)(1)(A).

15

is whether an omission from gross income occurs when a

16

taxpayer overstates his basis in sold property and

17

thereby understates the gain that results from the sale.

18

More specifically, the question

In December 2010, after notice-and-comment

19

rulemaking, the Treasury Department issued published

20

regulations that interpreted section 6501(e)(1)(A) to

21

apply in overstatement of basis cases.

22

regulations reflect a reasonable interpretation of

23

ambiguous statutory language, and they are accordingly

24

entitled to deference under Chevron.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Those

Well, but only if

Official

1

your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right?

2

If we think that Colony definitively resolved the

3

question before you, the regulation can't overturn that.

4

MR. STEWART:

If the Court in Colony had

5

interpreted the statutory language to be unambiguous, or

6

if the Court in Colony had issued an authoritative

7

interpretation that Congress had then built upon, that

8

would be correct.

9

the language was, in its words, "not unambiguous."

But the Court in Colony stated that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Yes, but once -- once we

11

resolve an ambiguity in a statute, that's the law, and

12

the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes

13

the law just because, going in, the language was

14

ambiguous.

15

MR. STEWART:

I think -- I don't think that

16

the Court in Colony purported to give a definitive

17

definition of the phrase "omits from gross income an

18

amount properly includible therein" wherever it appears

19

in the United States Code.

20

paragraph of its opinion in Colony said the sole

21

question before us is whether the taxpayer is subject to

22

the extended assessment period under the 19 -- under the

23

Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

24
25

And the Court in the first

And as the D.C. Circuit, for instance,
pointed out in Intermountain, what we are interpreting
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

now is the 1954 code.

2

code, it includes the phrase "omits from gross income an

3

amount properly includible therein," but it also

4

includes adjacent provisions that bear upon the meaning

5

of that phrase.

6

It's true that, like the 1939

I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if they use

7

the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed --

8

it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere,

9

I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came

10

in with the baggage it -- it carried from the Colony

11

case; right?

12

MR. STEWART:

I think it's important to

13

remember that the 1954 code was enacted in 1954, and the

14

Colony decision came in 1958.

15

point that if Congress had enacted the same language

16

after this Court's decision in Colony, then the adjacent

17

statutory provisions that we're relying on would be

18

pretty indirect means of an -- of expressing an intent

19

to change the law.

And so, I would take your

But what Congress was reacting to in 1954

20
21

was not this Court's Colony decision; it was reacting to

22

a circuit conflict and trying to resolve that conflict.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but our job is not to

24

plumb Congress's psyche and decide what they had in

25

mind.

It's to interpret the statute.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

And if, as you

Official

1

acknowledge, it's a pretty obscure way to change the law

2

from what we said it was, the law that's written there,

3

that's a very obscure way to change it.

4

think that the law stays the way it was.

5

MR. STEWART:

I'm inclined to

Well, let me point to the

6

statutory provisions that I have in mind, to explain a

7

little bit more fully why we think that the context in

8

which the new provision or the 1954 provision appears

9

bears on the -- the proper interpretation of the

10

disputed phrase.

11
12

It's at page 1a of the red brief, the
appendix to the Respondents' brief.

13

And the -- the general rule stated in

14

subsection (A) is:

15

income an amount properly includible therein which is in

16

excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income

17

stated in the return," the assessment period is 6 years

18

rather than 3 years.

"If the taxpayer omits from gross

20

purposes of the Internal Revenue Code generally, the

MR. STEWART:

Well, if you look at

subparagraph (i), Roman (i) -- or Roman (i) after the

7

general rule, it says:

25

oblique way to reflect an intent to change what the

2

the Court's decision in Colony, and it was reacting to a

3

circuit conflict.

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, this language would

7

have one meaning if the very same language were adopted

8

after our decision in -- in Colony and a different

9

meaning if it were adopted, as it was, before our

10

decision in Colony.

11

MR. STEWART:

Well, in our -- I think --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a very strange

13

approach to a -- to the meaning of a statute, it seems

14

to me.
MR. STEWART:

15

It may be strange, but I think

16

in a sense it's the Respondents who are striving for

17

strangeness, in the following way --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -- but you're

19

saying -- and I'm just trying to supplement

20

Justice Scalia's question so -- so you can continue to

21

answer it.

22

You're saying that the split is somehow more

23

obscure or more imprecise in its formulation than what

24

Colony did.

25

about Colony, they would have done it differently, but

You're saying that, oh, if Congress knew

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it was a split, this was close enough for government

2

work.

That seems to be your argument.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. STEWART:

And I --

No, I -- I guess there are two

5

things I'm saying.

6

order to construe the statute, we need to not put

7

ourselves in -- attempt to put ourselves in the minds of

8

Congress, but at least be aware of the state of the

9

world at the time that Congress acted.

10

The first thing I'm saying is, in

And in 1954, when Congress acted, there was

11

the circuit split.

12

endorse the Colony rule going forward and apply it to

13

trades -- to non-trade and -business taxpayers as well

14

as trades and businesses, the most natural thing would

15

have been to change the word "amount" in the main rule

16

to "item," to make clear that the main rule would apply

17

only when an item of gross receipts had been left off

18

the return altogether.

19

And if Congress had wanted to

It also would have been natural, if Congress

20

had wanted that rule to apply going forward, to change

21

the term "gross income" in the main rule to say "gross

22

receipts" because gross income --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I still don't understand

24

why the world was different after Colony addressed the

25

split than before Colony addressed the split.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

The issue

Official

1

is still the same.

2

MR. STEWART:

I guess the way I would

3

respond to your question, Justice Kennedy, is to say if

4

you look at the statute in its current form, both the

5

text of the main rule and the adjacent provisions that

6

contextually bear on its meaning, then I think ours is

7

by far the better interpretation.

8

what Respondents --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, really,

Well, by far?

law, and it said that that language meant a certain

16

thing.

is enough to change the meaning of the statute.

18

and I'm dubious about that.

19

It's -- it's the

And the issue is whether this is -- this change

MR. STEWART:

And --

I guess my main point is we

20

think our reading of the text is better, and what

21

Respondents have going for them is the argument that,

22

whether or not this is the way you would otherwise

23

construe the statute, once Colony has said what the

24

statute meant, the Court is bound by it.

25

And our point is that methodology doesn't

really work with this provision, because the Court in

2

Colony --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, don't you have

4

two arguments?

5

other is that even the statute remained the -- even if

6

the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a

7

decision that found ambiguity in the statute.

8

9

and reinterpret it, if you will.

10

One is that the statute changed, but the

MR. STEWART:

So, you

We do have the power under

11

Brand X, but we -- we don't think that the Court needs

12

to reach that question.

13

said that the --

14

And when the Court in Colony

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if the Court thinks it

15

has to reach that question because it agrees more with

16

Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute

17

stays the same, then you have independent Brand X

18

arguments, don't you?

19

MR. STEWART:

Yes, we do.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, about that

21

argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that

22

Justice Harlan used the term "ambiguous," right?

23

MR. STEWART:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Yes.

But he was writing

him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite.

4

And you can see him saying, well, that's a good

5

argument, but....

6

7

And, of course, I didn't know

He's not the sort of person who would

I don't think you necessarily can take the

8

use of the word "unambiguous" in his opinion to mean

9

what it does today.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he did say that

11

something was unambiguous, and that was the little (i)

12

that was added.

13

position on the '54 code; isn't that so?

And he also said he wasn't taking any

14

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. STEWART:

He did.

And the Court said that both

17

at the end of its opinion and it also said at the

18

beginning the only question before us is whether the

19

extended assessment period applies under the '39 code.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there -- is there

21

a case where we applied Chevron deference to a

22

pre-Chevron opinion?

23

Court looked at that, but the Court said it was

24

ambiguous; and so, we apply Chevron.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Even without Chevron -- I

MR. STEWART:

Let me give two -- let me --

23

amount of gross income, as though it meant item of gross

2

receipts.

That was the practical effect of the Court's

decision.

4

provisions of the current code make clear that that's

5

not a --

6

No, I didn't think that was

the basis.

I thought the basis is that there are two

kinds of things:

That's how I read it.

But I have a different question.

You can

18

pursue this one if you want.

19

bothering me about this case -- and I can't quite figure

20

out the answer to this -- is it seems to me when they

21

filed that tax return in April of 2000, it was a

22

terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of

23

creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage

24

of them.

But, Mr. Stewart, prior to

9

this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said,

10

ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not

11

controlling any -- any -- any longer?

12

MR. STEWART:

Yes, I think probably the best

13

indication of our -- the position in the intervening

14

years -- and we agree that there's a surprising dearth

15

of law -- was the Fifth Circuit litigation in Phinney,

16

P-H-I-N-N-E-Y, which was decided in 1968.

17

involved a situation in which the taxpayer accurately

18

reported the amount of gross receipts, approximately

19

$375,000, but misstated the nature of the receipts as

20

proceeds of a stock sale rather than of an installment

21

sale.

22

nature of the receipt made a difference was that it

23

potentially affected the taxpayer's entitlement to take

case, had the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or

5

rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an

6

outdated decision?

7

and I'm reading Colony and I'm thinking the language of

8

the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony

9

control?

10

Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer,

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- I think one reason

11

you might think that is that if you were -- you -- the

12

opinion was not oblivious to the fact that the 1954 code

13

had been enacted in the meantime, and the Court went out

14

of its way to say:

15

code, and we are not pronouncing on the meaning of the

16

1954 code, other than to note that our -- our conclusion

17

in this case is consistent with the unambiguous language

18

of new 6501(e)(1)(A).

19

in Intermountain, that is best read as a reference to

20

subparagraph (i), which says that for a trade or

21

business taxpayer, "gross income" will mean gross

22

receipts without an offset for the cost of acquiring

23

goods and services.

Boudin had written for the First Circuit in a case

4

called CC&F W. Operations in 2001 that it was at least

5

doubtful whether the main holding of Colony carried over

uncertainty.

16

just a kind of case-specific application of the more

19

disregarded.

It wasn't until 2000 that the IRS issued a

would trigger the general rule as an omission from gross

25

income, and because of the way that gross income is

That is, Congress defined the conduct that

24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

defined, an overstatement of basis can lead to an

2

understatement of gain, which in turn is taken into

3

account in computing gross income.

4

ultimately affect taxable income, but it doesn't affect

5

gross income.

6

the statute to encompass that.

7

A deduction may

And so, there would be no way of reading

Now, as to why Congress would have done

8

this, I think a clue is furnished by subparagraph Roman

9

(ii), which is at the bottom of page 1a, and it says:

10

"In determining the amount omitted from gross income,

11

there shall not be taken into account any amount which

12

is omitted from gross income stated in the return if

13

such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a

14

statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate

15

to apprise the Secretary of the nature and amount of

16

such item."

17

And so, that provides a safe harbor that

18

says even if you fall within the general rule, even if

19

you understated your gross income by more than

20

25 percent, if, at some point in the return, you gave

21

the IRS adequate information to notice that the

22

misstatement had taken place, you will be off the hook

23

for the 6-year assessment period.

24
25

And I think that is highly relevant in
responding to the policy concern that Justice Harlan
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

identified in Colony.

2

reason we think that Congress intended to restrict the

3

statute to situations where an item is left off the

4

return altogether is that those would be the most

5

difficult for the IRS to catch; the IRS would be placed

6

at a special disadvantage.

7

That is, Justice Harlan said the

Here in subparagraph (ii), Congress has

8

accomplished the same intent but through a different

9

mechanism.

That is, it's made the general rule sweep

10

more broadly but given taxpayers an out where the

11

disclosures are adequate.

12

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just on that point -- and

14

we'll find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to

I don't want to speculate too much on what he will say,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, our position is the

7

one that the Court reached in Colony, which is that an

8

overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross

9

income.

What the Court held in Colony was that an

10

omission -- an omission from gross income is where you

11

leave out a specific taxable item or receipt.

12

We think the court of appeals got it right

13

when it concluded that the statute of limitations on the

14

statute -- on the tax assessments at issue expired in

15

2003 and rejected the IRS's extraordinary efforts to

16

avoid that result by discombobulating this Court's

17

decision in Colony and by seeking to retroactively

18

reopen and extend the statute of limitations.

19

What the Government relies on principally is

20

the addition of subparagraph (i) in the code, and that

21

was added in 1954, before the Court's decision in 1958.

22

And I'd like to make a few points about subparagraph (i)

23

because I think it's the crux of the Government's

24

position.

25

The first is just the anomaly of their
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument, that by adding this subparagraph -- and it's

2

on page 1a of the addendum to the red brief -- which

3

explicates the definition of "gross income" in one

4

specific context, the sale -- the cost of goods or

5

services by a trade or business, Congress meant to

6

change the general rule -- and that's what it called it,

7

the "general rule" -- in subsection (A).

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:
added that paragraph?

Well, why do you think they

18

I think what maybe is most important is that

21

this Court in Colony looked at the 1954 amendments at

22

the suggestion of the government and concluded that its

23

decision was consistent with the 1954 amendments.

24

That's in the last line of the decision.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Were most of the --

28
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's got to mean --

2

that's got to refer to (i).

Harlan said two things.

4

therefore, I'm going to look at the legislative history

5

to find out what the predecessor section means.

6

It can't refer to the --

He said it's ambiguous;

And then he says:

I'm not going to

7

speculate on what this new thing means, but I do want to

8

point out that the result we reach in Colony is in

9

harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501, et

10

cetera.

The only unambiguous language that he could be

11

referring to is in (i) because he has just -- he had

12

said the earlier language was ambiguous.

13

MR. GARRE:

Well, I don't -- I don't think

14

so, Your Honor.

First of all, you're right, he referred

15

to the whole 6501(e)(1)(A), which includes both

16

subsections.

17

subparagraph (i).

18

subparagraph (ii), along the lines of what my friend

19

just spelled out, because much of the Colony decision

20

was based on addressing the situation where the -- where

21

the IRS is at a special disadvantage because something's

22

been left out entirely.

23

the heart of subparagraph (ii).

It's not clear that he was identifying
He could have well been referring to

And that really kind of gets to

24

But the anomaly of the Government's

25

construction here today is that Colony would come out
29
Alderson Reporting Company

differently, because Colony doesn't involve a taxpayer

involved in the sale of goods or service; it involved a

taxpayer in the sale of real property.

this Court in Colony said --

Your Honor, the sale of real

11

property, whether in parcels or otherwise, has always

12

been treated differently than the sale of -- costs of

13

goods or services, which really is a term of art.

14

if you go back at Colony, you can see that the Court

15

referred to basis, referred to property, and that's

16

precisely the way that the parties did in their brief.

17

18

question presented as overstatement of basis in the sale

19

of property.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I was going to ask in

services or were they all real estate sales?

7

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, the Uptegrove case

did, the Third Circuit case.

But they involved -- the

9

fact is they involved both the sale of property and the

10

sale of goods and services.

And at that time, no one

11

was drawing this bright-line distinction.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but the Congress

13

drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's

14

question, when it talks just about goods and services.

15

that taxpayers typically put more information which is

16

17

And the same was

And so, to the extent that there's a

The problem for the Government is all of the

18

amendments in 1954 were pro-taxpayer amendments as

19

relevant here; and yet, the Government's conclusion is

20

that by adding this subsection addressing the specific

21

situation, it meant to take away the general rule in a

22

way that hurt taxpayers.

23

this Court said in Colony because the Court --

24

Well, why would they be

5

rule, the general rule, is as you say it is?

6

MR. GARRE:

That's

Your Honor, everyone agrees it's

14

Kagan.

The -- the Federal Circuit in the Salman Ranch

15

case cited legislative history that suggested it was

16

trying to achieve just that result.

17

broader point I would make is it's not at all uncommon

18

for Congress to act to provide an answer to a specific

19

situation that had come up by explicating it.

20

one doesn't conclude that, in doing that, it's intended

21

to overstate -- override the entire general rule that's

22

stated, particularly where it doesn't touch the language

Because what I was thinking,

Mr. Garre -- and tell me what you think the consequence

of this would be -- is that if I were a tax lawyer and

7

would have said:

Well, I can't tell you 100 percent.

I

You know, it's the

same language, and there's Colony out there, and -- and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it also said before

that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the

7

speculative debate between the parties as to whether

Congress manifested an intention to clarify or --

clarify or change the 1939 code.

So, not taking a

10

position on whether the new section changes the code.

11

And the part that is in harmony -- I can't see how that

12

could be read to mean anything other than the (i), which

13

is unambiguous and certainly in harmony with the result

in Colony.
MR. GARRE:

15

Justice Ginsburg, the government

16

in Colony argued that the 1954 amendments compelled its

17

interpretation, which was the one that the Court

18

rejected.

19

considered that argument in reaching the opposite

conclusion.

21

fair to describe that language as dictum.

3

degree of ambiguity is Brand X referring to?

6

MR. GARRE:

And so, there was at

So, what

Well, I would -- I would think

that Brand X refers back to Chevron and looks to the

9

to is whether or not -- it's really a step one or step

Brand -- what Brand X is looking

10

two case.

And on step one, Chevron looks to whether

11

Congress has addressed the specific question presented.

12

And if you look at the Court's decision in Colony, what

13

Justice Harlan said was Congress was addressing itself

14

to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually

15

omitted some income receipt or accrual in his

16

computation of gross income, and not --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that was the specific

18

situation, but then the question was, how clearly did

19

Congress speak to that specific situation?

20

to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the

21

statute is -- that the statutory text is ambiguous, goes

22

to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that

23

legislative history actually speaks to the exact

24

question before the Court, only by implication.

25

And in order

So, if you look at the whole of -- of the

extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of

ambiguity.

MR. GARRE:

Well, I would disagree with

that, respectfully, Your Honor.

I think the -- the

6

holding of the Court -- and, again, it's entitled to

7

stare decisis effect even if this Court might approach

8

it differently today under different modes of statutory

9

construction or otherwise.

The holding of the Court was

10

that Congress addressed the specific situation of

11

whether an overstatement of basis was an omission from

12

gross income, and the Court said no.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, in the end, there has

14

to be a resolution.

But the question is, what does it

15

look like before you get to that resolution?

Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you

know, going to this Senate report, going to that House

report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree with you on that.

6

The -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, actually.

There

7

are many different kinds of ambiguity, and the question

8

is, is this of the kind where the agency later would

9

come and use its expertise?

And you're saying here it

10

was up to the Congress and looking at what they had in

11

mind.

12

All right.

Maybe that's the base -- best

13

ground, but suppose it turns out a majority think you're

14

not right on that.

15

Assuming you're wrong on that, which I'm not sure you

16

are, but assuming you're wrong, now we get to this

17

regulation.

18

at some level it seems rather unfair, but that instinct

19

is not enough.

Okay?

Now, here's my question:

Here is my problem:

One -- I have no doubt

The question is what -- what's the law?

(A) You can say the word "open" doesn't

23

regulation.

One is something to do with

language, which I think you can think of, which seems to

cut very much against you if read naturally, but you can

strain it to read it in your favor.

5

to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although

6

they left it out of their brief and they put in

7

ellipses, I can see why they left it out because when

8

you read it it's again ambiguous.

9

problem.
Then you could say:

10

And the other has

We run into the same

Well, they're not

11

supposed to do these things retroactively, either on

12

common law administrative law grounds or something like

13

that; they shouldn't do it; it's unfair.

14

And they'll say:

But, you see, it wasn't

15

that unfair; a child of 2 would have known this was a

16

loophole.

17

And the IRS never said anything, except for one district

director in a different district that really encouraged

19

or underwrote this kind of thing.

That's how they would have characterized it.

MR. GARRE:

look at the language of the regulation and see whether

4

or not --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. GARRE:

"Open," that's the term.

-- by its terms, it applies

7

retroactively.

This Court has made clear, it made clear

8

in the Bowen case, that it's not retroactively unless

9

there's a clear -- not retroactive unless there's a

10

clear statement of retroactivity.

11

whatever else is true, that what the effective date

12

provision says and the preamble says, it's just unclear

13

about whether it's retroactive or not.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And our position is,

I never thought that a

15

revision of a statute of limitation was retroactive

16

legislation, just as I've never thought that a provision

17

altering rules of evidence for a crime, even for crimes

18

that were committed before that alteration, is

19

retroactive legislation.

MR. GARRE:

Well, I --

You know, the crucial date

is the date -- at least it's not -- well, you can extend

I think it's retroactive in the

worst way, for this reason:

6

7

against retroactivity technically applies.

9

MR. GARRE:

Well, again, I mean, I think if

you look at Landgraf and the cases talking about what is

10

retroactive, this regulation here if it is applied

11

retroactivity -- retroactively has the consequence this

12

Court points to as the worst kind of retroactivity,

13

which is extinguishing a valid defense in litigation and

14

imposing new consequences for past actions.

15

Aircraft recognizes that, as do the many courts of

the government gets there is to say that, well, even

though we've passed the regulation long after the

statute of limitations expired, because this case is

4

pending, we can apply the new interpretation in

5

determining whether the period closed long before we

passed this regulation.

7

At a minimum, that's -- that's a highly

8

strained, if not convoluted, way to get around

9

retroactivity.

10

The way that the regulation's effective date

11

and the preamble speaks about whether this is

retroactive or not is really kind of nonsensical.

think, at a minimum, the taxpayer ought to get the

benefit of that, and this Court should say that if the

15

government really wants to do -- take the extraordinary

16

step that it's taken here to retroactively reopen a

statute of limitations, it ought to do so in clear terms

18

and not the convoluted way it's done here.

We also think that the -- the IRS just

lacked the authority to -- to legislate, to -- to pass a

new interpretation on a statute retroactively.

provisions.

20

after" obviously modifies that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. STEWART:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

I'd like to make three quick points.

15

First, Mr. Garre refers to the amended

16

heading of section -- subsection 6501(e), which now

17

states "Substantial omission of items," but I think the

18

heading simply points up the fact that some provisions

19

within subsection (e) refer to amounts and some to

20

items.

21

gift taxes, refers to omission of items.

22

Subsection (e)(2), which deals with estate and

And the legislative history makes clear that

23

Congress chose that term precisely to make clear that

24

the understatement -- or the overstatement or

25

understatement of an item that was reported will not

give rise to the extended period.

2

The second thing is that, at bottom,

3

4

gross income" should be construed to mean item of gross

5

receipts.

6

argument as to why that would be a sound reading.

construe the 1954 code.

12

And it stated that the relevant -- the most

13

relevant language was not unambiguous.

14

recognition of ambiguity is relevant in part because it

15

sets up our Brand X argument, but it's also relevant

16

because saying that a particular snippet of language is

17

ambiguous is to recognize that its meaning may vary

18

depending on context.

19

And I think the

And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stewart, I know

20

you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you

21

get it out, but you mentioned Brand X.

22

applied Brand X to one of our decisions?

23

said an agency by regulation can alter and change one --

24

a Supreme Court decision?

25

MR. STEWART:

No.

Have we ever
Have we ever

I mean, Brand X was the

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

first case that announced the Brand X principle, and the

2

Court has not applied it since.

3

Justice Stevens --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Well, but that was

applying it to a court of appeals decision.
MR. STEWART:

That was applying it to a

court of appeals decision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

We've never

said an agency can change what we've said the law means.
MR. STEWART:

No.

Justice Stevens wrote a

11

separate opinion in Brand X, suggesting that it might

12

not apply to decisions of this Court, but the Court as a

13

whole did not pronounce on that.

14

And then the third point I would want to

15

make is that Mr. Garre referred to cases and one IRS

16

General Counsel opinion that were issued during the

17

period between 1958 and 2000 that applied Colony to the

18

current statute, but they did so in a very specific way.

19

That is, they relied on the aspects of Colony that

20

talked about Congress's purpose to reserve the extended

21

assessment period for cases in which the IRS was at a

22

special disadvantage due to inadequate disclosure.

23

those cases applied that language in elucidating current

24

subparagraph (ii), which provides a safe harbor in cases

25

of adequate disclosure.
55
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

Respondents' position goes much further,

2

though.

3

the proposition that even if its disclosures were

4

inadequate, the extended period still can't be applied

5

to it.

6
7

Respondent is attempting to rely on Colony for

And none of the decisions on which
Respondents rely establish that proposition.

8

Thank you.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Thank you, counsel,

counsel.

11

The case is submitted.

13

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
