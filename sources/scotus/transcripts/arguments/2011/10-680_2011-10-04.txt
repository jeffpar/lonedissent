ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

This case raises two issues:

The first is

11

whether the right against self-incrimination requires

12

that a prisoner always be Mirandized before being

13

interviewed in isolation about conduct that occurred

14

outside the prison.

15

whether this Court in Mathis clearly established such a

16

per se rule.

17

questions is no.

18

The second is an AEDPA question,

For three reasons, the answer to both

First, for nearly 50 years this Court has

19

declined to adopt any new per se rule that always

20

requires a Miranda warning, instead considering all the

21

circumstances.

custody itself is a circumstance?

1

MR. BURSCH:

It would be much more

2

difficult, but the test would be whether a reasonable

3

person in the prisoner's position felt that they were

4

free to go back to their cell in accord with reasonable,

5

ordinary prison procedures.

6

that's consistent with J.D.B.

8

years.

9

And that would be the test

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

and, I submit, with every

All right.

So, what

10

makes this case different?

He's taken from a -- except

11

being told that he could leave.

12

from his cell, removed from the prison, his normal

13

setting, taken by armed guards to another building and,

14

with guards at the door, sat down and told talk to us

15

about this incident, why would he think he was free to

16

leave?

If he had been taken

There is one fact I'm taking out of it.

Well, there --

Which is that he was

There are a number of

21

circumstances that kind of culminate in what I consider

22

to be the two most important.

circumstances:

24

It was a conference room, not an interrogation room with

25

a bright light.

Some of the background

He was in a room that was not locked.

He was not shackled.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

He was not

Official

1

threatened.

2

The two big ones are, one, that when he started to

3

become belligerent, the guards told him that if you

4

don't want to cooperate, then you'll have to go back to

5

your cell; you'll have to leave.

6

opposite of Miranda custody, where --

7

He was not physically harmed in any way.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's the exact

There -- as I see the

8

record, he claims twice he said, I don't want to talk to

9

you.

And when he asked to leave at the end, it took

10

20 minutes, and they continued the questioning.

11

that counter the rest of what you're saying?

12

MR. BURSCH:

Doesn't

They are two factors that go

13

into the mix, and I'll discuss each one in turn.

14

he says, I don't want to talk anymore, then he went on

15

and kept talking.

16

did he keep talking?

17

fair reading of it anyway, that he was trying to explain

18

to the officers this timeline that he kept talking

19

about.

20

When

And you have to consider, well, why
Well, the record shows, I think a

seconds, it could have been an hour, depending on

25

procedures, demonstrates why a per se rule doesn't make

And the fact that it

sense.

We should look at all the circumstances.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is a per se rule

3

necessarily what is being argued here?

4

he had no choice but to go with the police, right?

5

MR. BURSCH:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

For one thing,

That's correct.
So, it's different from

7

some cases where the prisoner initiates the

8

conversation.

9

MR. BURSCH:

That is a little bit different,

10

but the key facts here are, one, at the beginning, the

11

questioning officers say, you're free to stop this and

12

go back to your cell.

13

belligerent, and they say, if you don't want to

14

cooperate, you have to leave; you have to go back to

15

your cell.

16

custody.

Then in the middle, he gets

Which is, I submit, the opposite of Miranda

17

And then when he finally invokes his right

18

to go back to his cell, it's immediately honored with,

19

of course, the 20-minute delay due to prison procedures.

20

And so, from beginning to end, a reasonable person in

21

his position could have believed they were free to

22

return.

23

And that's all that Miranda requires.
In fact, we have a trial court finding on

24

that, on three of them:

One, that he was told he was

25

free to go; second, that he understood he was free to
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

go; and, third, that he was free to go.

2

I --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's all

And it doesn't make any

4

difference that they -- they took him from his cell, he

5

was under compulsion to leave with them and interrogated

6

during the hours when prisoners are ordinarily sleeping?

7

MR. BURSCH:

Again, I would submit those are

8

all circumstances that should go into this

9

all-the-circumstances consideration.

You know, there

10

were also other things that militated in favor of the

11

trial court findings, such as the explicit instruction

12

that he was free to leave; that he would have to go back

13

if he didn't cooperate; that they did honor his request

14

to leave, once made.

15

the court should look at.

16

So, these are all the things that

And you can imagine a number of other

17

situations, maybe with facts different than these, where

18

a per se rule would be wholly inappropriate.

19

what if they had invited him to come down and he had the

20

choice at the beginning?

21

outside the door and took him immediately as soon as he

22

said, I'm ready to go back?

23

this isn't the place for a per se rule; that we should

24

just follow the same Miranda test that has been applied

25

for 50 years, and that's all the circumstances.

You know,

What if someone was stationed

It just demonstrates that

8
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, when you say that,

2

I took sometimes your brief and the U.S. Government's

3

brief to be saying something more, which is that it's

4

not all the circumstances; it's all the circumstances

5

minus circumstances that are attendant upon normal

6

prison living.

7
8

So, are you still arguing that, or are you
really arguing an all-the-circumstances test?

9

MR. BURSCH:

We're not taking quite that

10

strong a position.

11

And the analogy that I would draw is just like in the

12

J.D.B. case last term, that you would consider not only

13

the age of the suspect, but also the school environment.

14

So, I'm not saying the prison environment is taken out

15

of the equation; just that it's not dispositive in and

16

of itself, just like this Court held in Shatzer.

17

We're arguing all the circumstances.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, a court can still

18

think -- when it's doing an all-the-circumstances

19

inquiry, it can still factor in something like, you

20

know, it just -- it was going to take him an hour to get

21

back to his cell.

22

can consider along with everything else.

23
24
25

That's still something that the court

MR. BURSCH:

Is that right?

Not only can, but should.

Absolutely.
And, you know, one of the benefits of having
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a per se -- I'm sorry -- of having an

2

all-the-circumstances rule, rather than a per se rule,

3

is that it encourages truthful, voluntary confessions.

4

And this Court has repeatedly recognized that such

5

confessions are an unmitigated social good.

6

something that we want.

7

that there are a variety of non-prison contexts where it

8

would certainly be easier to have a per se rule.

9

could have done that in J.D.B.

10

That's

And you can imagine, again,

You

You know, it's so coercive to take an

11

8-year-old child to the principal's office with an

12

officer and question him, that per se there's always

13

going to be some child version of the Miranda rule.

14

we don't do that.

15

physically unable to leave.

account.

But

Or if you had someone in the hospital

We don't have a hospital

There shouldn't be one in prisons,

We should just take all the circumstances into

20

And I think really the lesson of Shatzer is

21

that we start, Justice Kagan, right where you did, that

22

just simply being in prison, being interrogated -- I'm

23

sorry -- being in jail alone is not enough.

going to become one factor that we consider in this

larger test.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BURSCH:

I don't think that's the case

2

because, under Shatzer, there's nothing Miranda

3

custodial about simply being in his cell.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

from his cell, as it appears to here because he was

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

case weaker, not stronger, that statement.
MR. BURSCH:

12

13

someone, if you don't cooperate, we are going to keep

14

you here as long as it takes.

15

just the opposite.

16

beginning -- if you tell us that you want to leave,

we'll honor that request -- and consistent with what

actually happened at the end.

back, and they honored that request.

21

And here they were saying

And the message they sent was

And I think one of the other factors that

22

you put in the mix here is that we were dealing with

23

outside officers, not inside prison officers.

24

outside officers did not have the ability to impact his

25

day-to-day prison life the way someone inside the prison
12
Alderson Reporting Company

These

Official

would.

2

Now, one other point I want to make about in

3

and out of prison is this artificial line that the Sixth

4

Circuit drew to cabin its per se rule.

5

if the conduct takes place outside the prison, per se

6

you get Miranda; if the conduct that they're questioning

7

talking about was inside the prison walls, we're not

8

going to do that.

9

make that policy decision because, otherwise, prison

10

They said that

administration becomes very difficult.

11

But under this Court's precedent and under

12

the Fifth Amendment itself, there is nothing that would

13

suggest that there should be a distinction in the

14

Miranda analysis as to the locus of the conduct that is

15

being questioned about.

16

And it's possible to have a very serious

17

in-prison crime, a murder of another inmate, and a very

18

nominal outside crime, petty theft, and, yet, the Sixth

19

Circuit would give pure Miranda protection to that petty

20

theft questioning and no protection at all to the person

21

who murdered someone inside the prison walls.

22

just demonstrates where the Sixth Circuit rule starts to

23

fall apart.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

his question, which way does it cut?

17

Thank you.
Ms. Anders.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. ANDERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Sixth Circuit has imposed a per se rule

18

that whenever a prison inmate is isolated for

19

questioning about conduct that occurred outside the

20

prison, that inmate is in custody for Miranda purposes,

21

regardless of the circumstances of the interrogation.

22

But in the prison context, as in any other, the

23

traditional Miranda custody tests should apply, and the

24

question should be whether, in light of all of the

25

circumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect's
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position would have felt free to terminate the interview

2

and leave.

3

That is so for three reasons:

The first is

4

that the Court reaffirmed, in Maryland v. Shatzer, that

5

restraints on a suspect's freedom of movement are a

6

necessary but not sufficient condition for Miranda

7

custody.

8

freedom of movement is restrained may nonetheless feel

9

that he is free to terminate the questioning.

10

In other words, a reasonable suspect whose

Second, there are, in fact, many situations

11

in which a reasonable inmate isolated for questioning

12

would feel free to terminate the interrogation despite

13

being subject to background prison restrictions.

14

And, third, the Sixth Circuit's per se rule

15

here requires Miranda warnings to be given in situations

16

in which the concerns about custodial interrogation that

17

drove Miranda are simply not present.

18

impairs the important truth-seeking function of

19

investigations by requiring the suppression of voluntary

20

confessions made in noncustodial situations.

The difference is that the

freedom of movement.

22

situation, the ultimate question is whether the

23

reasonable inmate would feel free to terminate the

24

questioning, and one situation you look to in

25

determining that are the physical restraints on that

But when you look at the prison

person.

And when you look at the restraints, you have

2

to take into account the fact that the prisoner has a

3

baseline, which is that he has some restrictions on his

4

movement.

5

That's what the Court said in Shatzer.
And so, when you look at the totality of the

6

circumstances, you consider the restraints and the

7

prisoner's baseline, but you also consider everything

8

else that happens during the questioning.

9

could be many situations in which the questioning will

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I ask you a different

15

sort of question, Ms. Anders?

16

Sixth Circuit did here, if you look back at the initial

17

State court opinion, do you read the State court -- do

18

you think the State court is fairly read, could the

19

Sixth Circuit have fairly read it, as establishing its

20

own per se rule, which was the per se rule we rejected

21

in Mathis?

22

required some kind of nexus between the prison custody

23

and the interrogation?

24
25

Putting aside what the

In other words, that the State supreme court

MS. ANDERS:

I think it's -- I think it's --

the State court opinions are somewhat unclear.
20
Alderson Reporting Company

There

Official

1

are some statements that could be taken to be

2

inconsistent with Mathis, but immediately after those

3

statements, the State court said, well, it's not enough

4

alone for custody that someone is incarcerated on a

5

conviction that's unrelated to their questioning, and we

6

look to the fact that the inmate was told that he was

7

free to leave, and he actually felt free to leave.

8
9

So, I think the best reading of the State
courts' opinions is that they did go through the

10

totality of the circumstances, and they did conclude

11

that Respondent reasonably felt that he was free to

12

leave in this interview.

13

But, more importantly, I think the Sixth

14

Circuit went much further than that and imposed a per se

15

rule that says no matter what the questioners do, no

16

matter what a prisoner is told, no matter how free he

17

feels to leave, that person always has to be Mirandized.

18

And that extends Miranda way beyond its initial

19

concerns.

20

Voluntary confessions, this Court has

21

recognized, are an unmitigated good.

22

someone confesses voluntarily in a noncustodial

23

situation, the Sixth Circuit's rule, applied to prisons,

24

would say that that person 's confession has to be

25

suppressed, even though it was given in a situation that
21
Alderson Reporting Company

So, any time

Official

1
2

doesn't implicate Miranda's concerns at all.
And I think the Sixth Circuit's rule really

3

arose from two assumptions.

One was that isolation

4

alone is sufficient to create custody in all

5

circumstances.

6

know that an inmate can be told that he can leave, he

7

can be given an initial choice before he comes along for

8

questioning, he can be interrogated in isolation purely

9

because he's waiting to be treated in an infirmary.

And that can't be the case, because we

10

There are any number of situations, I think, where an

11

inmate could be isolated for questioning, but he would

12

still feel free to leave.

13

And going to Justice Sotomayor's question

14

about whether someone in prison necessarily feels

15

coerced, I think that the Court in Shatzer established

16

that background restrictions incident to being

17

incarcerated are not in themselves sufficient to create

18

Miranda custody.

19

such a huge coercive impact that nobody would feel free

20

to terminate questioning.

21

So, in other words, they don't create

So, I think accepting the proposition that

22

someone in prison is always coerced would lead to a per

23

se rule that says no matter how non-accusatorial, no

24

matter how noncoercive that situation is, that person

25

would always be in custody.

So --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you're going back

3

to confusing coercion issues with custody issues, and I

asked.

custody?

9

Someone's picked off the street and

Wouldn't we assume that that person is in

MS. ANDERS:

I think in either situation,

10

you have to look to the totality of the circumstances.

11

And so, we know that restraints alone -- the restraints

12

of prison aren't enough alone.

13

consider the restraints -- when you consider the fact

14

that a prisoner is told he has to go into a room, you

15

would look not only to that fact, but you'd also look to

16

everything that happens in the questioning.

17

And so, when you

But then when you go back to consider the

18

fact that the prisoner was told that he has to come to

19

the room, you would -- you would look to whether it's a

20

normal prison policy that prisoners always have to be

21

escorted places.

22

determine whether --

23

And so, that would help the court

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but he didn't

24

choose to go to that room.

He was placed in that room.

25

What makes him think that if -- if his jailers are
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

walking him somewhere, that he's free to leave?

2

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think two points:

One

3

is that -- the fact that he is asked to -- the fact that

4

he is told he has to go to this room is not the only

5

circumstance of the interrogation.

6

happens in the questioning can lead a reasonable

7

prisoner to believe that he's free to go, even though

8

he's been told he has to go to the questioning.

9

So, certainly, what

So, if he is told he can leave, if it

10

becomes clear from experience, if there's a prison

11

policy saying that inmates can always leave, if he sees

12

that he can summon the guards -- all of those

13

circumstances have to be taken into account in addition

14

to the fact that he was told initially that he has to go

15

with the guard.

16

And the second thing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If he were out and the

17

police officer said, come along with us, he could say

18

no.

19

But here he didn't -- he didn't have that choice.
MS. ANDERS:

That's right.

He didn't have

20

that initial choice.

But once he got into the

21

questioning, I think this case is a good example of what

22

can happen where the inmate here was told that he could

23

end the questioning.

24

Miranda custody is whether the reasonable person would

25

feel free to terminate the interrogation.

And so, the ultimate question for

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And so, in considering all of the

2

circumstances, one circumstance would be that the inmate

3

was told he has to come to the questioning, but another

4

circumstance would be that he was then told once he got

5

there that he could end the questioning.

6
7

And so, there are -- there are other factors
like that that --

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it -- is the time

relevant, that this was done -- they took him away at
7:00 in the evening and kept him for 7 hours?

11

MS. ANDERS:

I think that would be a

12

relevant factor here, too, as would the fact that the

13

door was partially open, that the -- the questioning was

14

not threatening, there were only two officers.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they -- that didn't

16

do him any good, because he couldn't get back to his

17

cell without being escorted there.

18

MS. ANDERS:

That's correct.

That -- that

19

is a -- that's a background restraint of incarceration,

20

and in looking at whether that particular restraint made

21

the inmate feel that he couldn't terminate the

22

questioning, you would look both to the fact that --

23

that, as he himself said, it's common sense that inmates

24

have to be escorted to and from places in the prison.

25

And also -25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I wonder

2

why you just agreed that the 7 hours would be a

3

pertinent circumstance.

4

be a pertinent circumstance on overall voluntariness,

5

perhaps, but once you're told you can leave whenever you

6

want, I don't see why it matters at all how long he's

7

kept there.

MS. ANDERS:

It strikes me that that would

It is a circumstance within the

13

totality of the circumstances here, but it -- it's --

14

any kind of effect that it had on making the inmate feel

15

that he couldn't terminate the question was entirely

16

offset by the fact that he was told that he could leave

multiple times.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. JACOBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I want to address the issue of whether
someone is free to leave.

Recently, there have been
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

several cases, and Cervantes is one, and I can't

2

remember whether it was Alvardo -- Alvarado or J.D.B.,

3

where the courts have said that in a prison setting the

4

statement that you're free to leave has less

5

significance than if you're in a -- in the free world.

6

So, I would suggest that when you look at

7

this, that that particular issue, or that particular

8

statement, should not be given the same weight in prison

9

as out.

And one of the reasons I suggest is because if

10

a prisoner is told he's free to leave and he's in

11

custody and we know he's in custody because he's in

12

prison, he really under these facts does not have the

13

capability of getting up and leaving.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it certainly -- it

certainly doesn't mean he can leave the prison, right?

16

In this case, the prisoner had to rely on

the sheriff's deputies that were interrogating in order

6

to effectuate his freedom.

7

that he said he wanted to -- that -- I think he said

8

that he didn't want to answer any questions, or he

9

wanted to leave, and we don't hear any more about it --

about that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What sense does that make?

Why is one more in custody depending on the subject that
the police want to question the person about?

11

MS. JACOBS:

And in certain circumstances, I

12

agree with you, that in fact, this Court should hold

13

that when the correction officers are investigating a

14

crime within the prison, then -- and they remove the

15

prisoner and they isolate him, take him out of the

16

general population, that this Court should then hold

17

Miranda is applicable.

18

But when it's voluntary --

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, whenever they --

19

whenever a prisoner is isolated and questioned about a

20

crime, no matter where it occurs, a Miranda warning has

21

to be given?

22

MS. JACOBS:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MS. JACOBS:

25

Yes.
About a possible crime?

Yes.

I mean -- there doesn't

seem to me to be possible crimes.

Alderson Reporting Company

They always turn out

to be crimes.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is that consistent

3

with the totality of the circumstances test that we've

4

always insisted upon in Miranda cases?

5

MS. JACOBS:

Well, Miranda -- not all the --

6

there are bright-line rules attached to Miranda, so that

7

Miranda itself is a bright-line rule.

8

bright-line rule I don't think is outside the purview of

9

Miranda -- of Miranda law.

So, to state a

And it's easier for the

10

officers to apply; it's easier for the courts to apply;

11

and there would be more consistency.

12

But, Justice Alito, I want to make sure that

13

you understand that I think if it's on-the-scene

14

questioning about a crime occurring on prison, that I

15

don't think you have to give Miranda rights; that if

16

it's voluntary, if the officer -- if the defendant comes

17

up to an officer and starts chatting away and starts

18

mentioning a crime, that's voluntary.

19

consistent with Miranda.

I don't think you really have

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if a prisoner is stabbed

22

in the yard and there are 50 prisoners in the yard at

10

MS. JACOBS:

If they are removed from the

11

general population, if they're taken by a corrections

12

officer to a cell where they're going to be

13

interrogated -- they are isolated; it's incommunicado;

14

they're being interrogated by officers; they know

1

that -- the inference that he was isolated, that he's in

He's not in a prison library -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that there was

5

no discussion of the "in custody" point in Mathis.

was assumed that they were in custody, and the issue was

whether he could be questioned about a crime other than

I read Mathis as to say that he

10

was in custody for the -- for the question of the crime.

12

it's a police-dominated atmosphere and that they're

questioning about a crime that occurred outside the

2

MS. JACOBS:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- and I think you

4

repeated the phrase from -- from Miranda that what the

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This Court, this Court,

12

because this Court now seems to assume that it must be

13

in custody and not -- not otherwise deprived of action,

14

that being in custody is essential.

15

MS. JACOBS:

I -- I read that as still being

16

the law, that there are the two clauses; one is you're

17

under arrest, and the other is your freedom of movement

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do you think

2

that your argument or the decision of the court below

3

was implicit in or an extension of Mathis?

4

you don't -- you're not free of Miranda just because

5

it's a different crime.

6

before the Sixth Circuit in this case?

7

MS. JACOBS:

Mathis says

How does that answer the issue

I think that when -- when the

8

Sixth Circuit is analyzing the State court decision,

9

they're looking at the State court decision, and that

10

decision says if there's no nexus between what you're

11

being questioned about and what you're in custody for,

12

then you don't have to give Miranda.

13
14

So, I think the Sixth Circuit found that to
be contrary to the language in Mathis.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought what

16

we've been arguing about is not the nexus issue, but

17

instead whether, in light of the circumstances or under

18

an absolute rule, there's custody.

19

MS. JACOBS:

I think we're arguing about two

20

things.

I think the Court is going to have to decide

21

two things, and one is whether the Sixth Circuit's

22

decision about whether the State court's decision was

23

24

decision.

25

going to be this per se rule about whether if you're --

I think that's one

And the other decision is whether there's

38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

whether you're in custody or not and under what

2

circumstances there might be a per se rule.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what is the

4

clearly established law set forth in our cases that

5

answers that latter question?

6

MS. JACOBS:

Whether -- if there's a per se

7

rule?

There is not a clearly established law.

There

8

could be -- under a rational extension issue, but it's a

9

little more attenuated.

But I don't think that I --

10

that there -- that the Respondent would lose on that

11

issue.

12

decision is not wrong; the State court's decision was

13

contrary to the clearly established law of Mathis.

He would still win because the Sixth Circuit's

That's the general principle.

Custody is when the

referring to the whole umbrella of -- of people that

18

would come into the prison, including people that would

19

be in the prison and want to talk to -- to prisoners.

officers but correction officials.

proposition that saying someone is free to leave is a

substitute for Miranda warnings, that my client was very
