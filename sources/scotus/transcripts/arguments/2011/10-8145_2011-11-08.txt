CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established

11

the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must

12

hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense

13

before trial.

14

of that principle.

This case presents a flagrant violation

15

The Orleans Parish district attorney's

16

office produced almost no relevant evidence to the

17

defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was

18

convicted of first-degree murder based solely on the

19

testimony of a single eyewitness.

20

defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on

21

multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the

22

perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know

23

them if he saw them.

24
25

Unbeknownst to the

The suppression of those statements alone
justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

office in this case also engaged in the wholesale

2

suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses,

3

statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness

4

identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast

5

doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the

6

shootings.

7

If all of that information had been

8

disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely

9

would have viewed this case in a completely different

10

light.

The trial court therefore erred by rejecting

11

Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be

12

reversed.

13

In our view, in order to conclude that

14

Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court

15

need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed

16

statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner.

17

Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld

18

from the defense before trial, and argues only that the

19

failure to disclose those statements was not

20

prejudicial.

21

Those statements, however, could not have

22

more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident

23

identification of Petitioner at trial --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, he saw a picture.

Boatner saw a picture in a newspaper, and that turned on
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the light for him, right?

2

suggestion.

3

It wasn't any police

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct.

The basis

4

for Boatner's identification was that he saw a

5

photograph in the New Orleans newspaper of Petitioner.

6

It was in connection with an article describing the

7

shootings and suggesting that Petitioner was one of the

8

suspects in the case.

9

prior identification out of court.

And that was what led to his

10

But just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg,

11

we're not arguing today that the identification was

12

somehow constitutionally problematic.

13

arguing that the identification was of questionable

14

validity in light of the fact that Boatner had only a

15

limited opportunity to see the perpetrators and in light

16

of the circumstances that led to his identification.

17

At most, we're

Now, even if his identification were more

18

clearly reliable, our argument today would be the same.

19

In a case such as this one, in which the sole basis for

20

linking the defendant to the crime is the testimony of a

21

single eyewitness, and there is evidence that the single

22

eyewitness said on multiple occasions that he couldn't

23

identify anyone, we believe that, absent extraordinary

24

circumstances, that will be sufficient to --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, aren't you
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exaggerating a little bit about the value of the

2

impeachment evidence regarding Boatner?

3

understanding is that he made his first statement to the

4

effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene

5

when he had been at the scene where five people that he

6

knew very well had been killed.

7

Now, my

He was lying on the floor with a big gash on

8

his head.

He was questioned at the scene, and at that

9

time -- and this was in the evening -- he said:

I can't

10

identify anybody.

But then, later that very day, wasn't

11

it, that very evening, after midnight, he was questioned

12

at the police station; am I correct?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that's correct.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And at that point he gave a

15

description.

He did make an -- he did provide a

16

description of the person that he said was the one who

17

first came through the door.

18

don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were

19

statements to the effect that he couldn't identify

20

anybody.

So, you know, that -- I

21

But in light of the fact that he did provide

22

a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the

23

very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you

24

exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times --

25

identify -MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Alito, it is true

3

that Boatner provided identifying details in the later

4

statement that night.

5

they were relatively limited identifying details, simply

6

the fact that the first man through the door had a

7

low-cut haircut and gold teeth.

8

our brief, those were characteristics shared by numerous

9

other suspects in the case.

10

I would respectfully submit that

And as we indicate in

But I think more broadly, with regard to

11

both sets of statements at issue here, the State's

12

explanations for those statements are at best plausible.

13

And we really think that in a case such as this one, in

14

which the evidence on its face is so clearly of high

15

exculpatory or impeaching values, it takes something

16

more than that.

17

argue here simply that, even taking into account these

18

statements, a rational juror could still reach the same

19

result and return a verdict of guilty here, because this

20

Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that the standard

21

for Brady claims is not a Jackson v. Virginia type

22

sufficiency of the evidence standard.

It is not sufficient for Respondent to

23

So, again, where you have statements that on

24

their face are not simply statements calling a witness's

25

credibility into question, but statements that really
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

directly contradict the confident in-court

2

identification, it would take an exceedingly persuasive

3

explanation for those statements to defeat a showing of

4

materiality.

5

Now, with regard -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The standard is a

6

reasonable probability that the result would have been

7

different, reasonable probability?

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that's correct.

And

this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that that's

10

not a more likely than not standard.

11

essentially the same standard that this Court has

12

articulated for prejudice for ineffective assistance of

13

counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, and by

14

now it's a quite clearly established standard.

15

again, it requires something less than a showing of more

16

likely than not and perhaps something slightly more than

17

the showing required for harmless error under Chapman v.

18

California.

19

That is

And,

But I do want to touch upon the State's

20

explanations for these statements and explain very

21

briefly why we think that those explanations are frankly

22

not even plausible.

23

to which Justice Alito referred, the statement that was

24

made at the scene approximately half an hour after

25

initial -- officers initially responded to the scene,

With regard to the first statement

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the State's argument is that Boatner was somehow too

2

traumatized to make an identification at the time.

3

But not only did Boatner not so testify at

4

the postconviction hearing -- in fact he testified that

5

he couldn't recall the statement at all -- but the very

6

officer who took the statement himself testified at

7

trial in this case that at the time of the statement

8

Boatner was, quote, "coherent and articulated very well

9

the events that transpired."

10
11

And that is at pages 137

to 138 of the joint appendix.
JUSTICE ALITO:

That may be true, but if you

12

were a juror and Boatner testified and he was

13

cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based

14

on his failure to make an identification right at the

15

scene, and he said, well, that was because five of my

16

friends had just been killed and I was lying on the

17

floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had

18

a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later

19

when I collected myself and they asked me the same

20

question at the police station, I provided a description

21

and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody -- do you

22

think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he

23

couldn't identify him at the scene so he must have been

24

lying when he identified -- when he provided a

25

description later at the police station?

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Alito, I think that

2

it's possible that a juror could credit that explanation

3

in any retrial, though I --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't there also an

5

intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he

6

couldn't identify?

7

the night, the same night.

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that was after what he said on

That is -Five days later he said:

10

I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him.

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct, Justice

12

Ginsburg.

But even if we didn't have the March 6th

13

statement or statements, I would frankly be happy to

14

take my chances with the jury, even with regard solely

15

to the March 1st statement, in light of that testimony

16

of Officer Ronquillo that Boatner was in fact coherent,

17

articulated very well the events that transpired, just

18

like any witness, and so on and so forth.

19

So, again -- -

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Counselor --

-- we don't think that it's

22

our burden to show that no juror could credit the

23

State's explanation.

24

that explanation doesn't hold water.

25

It's simply that we think that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, your argument

10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most

2

heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment

3

materials of the only witness to this crime and the only

4

piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime.

5

But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend

6

90 percent of their brief arguing against the other

7

things.

8

But I just want to clarify those other things.

Number one, was the testimony mixed
testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask
across their face or over their entire head?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the best take on

13

what the evidence showed that was presented on that

14

issue?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

15

There was some degree of

16

variation in what the witnesses said.

17

we're talking, again, about statements that were

18

withheld.

19

briefly, if I may.

20

21

the perpetrators, including the first man through the

22

door, were wearing masks.

25

Now, in the main,

And I want to lay out those statements very

declaration that she made at the scene in the immediate

2

aftermath of having been shot multiple times -- Russell

3

said she saw people barge into the kitchen; one had a

4

black cloth across the face, first one through the door.

5

So, it is at least theoretically possible --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask you

7

something?

Who determines that issue of whether that's

8

a dying declaration?

9

whether the withholding of the Brady materials was

12

whether it was a dying declaration?

13

on something like this?

14

Do we give deference to the lower

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Do they have to decide
What's the standard

The lower court did not make

15

such a determination in this case on this or any of the

16

other evidentiary issues that Respondent now advances,

17

at least in part because it does not appear that

18

Respondent advanced any of those arguments below.

19

think more broadly, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of the

20

role of this Court or any other court considering a

21

Brady claim, this Court hasn't quite spoken to the

22

specific issue of whether a Brady court is supposed to

23

itself make an evidentiary determination where there's a

24

question about admissibility, but the closest that this

25

Court came was in Wood v. Bartholomew, in which this
12
Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official

1

Court indicated that with regard to Brady material, it

2

either has to itself be admissible or be reasonably

3

likely to lead to admissible evidence.

4

reasoning in Wood v. Bartholomew was somewhat spare on

5

that score.

6

opinion.

And the Court's

That was a summary reversal in a per curiam

7

But I do think that it would be appropriate

8

for a Brady court to make that determination itself or,

9

at a minimum, make a determination as to whether it

10

appears that it's reasonably likely that the evidence

11

would be admissible.

12

Here, we really don't think that it's a

13

close question, particularly with regard to the

14

statement of Shelita Russell, because the context of the

15

handwritten notes makes clear that the statement was

16

taken at the scene of the crime.

17

taken to the hospital approximately a half an hour after

18

the shootings occurred.

19

believed that she was dying.

20

dying declarations -- and I have no reason to believe

21

that the law is any different in Louisiana from the

22

Federal system or the 49 other States -- that would

23

comfortably satisfy that requirement.

24
25

Shelita Russell was

She told two witnesses that she
And so, under the law on

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, Mr. Mims was the

neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

in total, right, and two left the scene?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

There's some doubt as to

3

whether or not there were three or four assailants.

And

4

Mims himself, in all candor, was a little bit

5

inconsistent on that point.

6

both in the handwritten notes and in his testimony at

7

the postconviction hearing, that all of the assailants,

8

however many there were, were wearing masks and that --

9

that he saw them as they were getting into the car.

But he consistently said,

10

didn't say anything further other than that the masks

11

were ski-type masks.

He

12

But the State's argument with regard to the

13

materiality of Mims's statement is that it is possible

14

that the men would not have been wearing masks when they

15

entered the house to allegedly commit the armed robbery;

16

and, therefore, the fact that Boatner saw the first man

17

unmasked can be reconciled with his statement.

18

again, we would be happy to take our chances with the

19

jury and make the argument that that would be an

20

exceedingly unconventional way to go about committing an

21

armed robbery.

22

And,

And, again, with regard to the Russell and

23

Mims statements, I think it's important to remember that

24

we view those statements as going directly to and

25

contradicting Boatner's in-court identification.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

so, in some sense, we view those statements as being of

2

a piece with Boatner's own prior statements in which he

3

indicated that he could not identify anyone and that he

4

did not --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the defense have any

6

theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he

7

could identify this individual?

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

First of all, Justice Alito,

9

it would, of course, not be the defense's burden in any

10

subsequent retrial to come up with a theory of its own.

11

The defense could simply argue, as it did at the first

12

trial, that the prosecution simply didn't bear its

13

burden on reasonable doubt.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

But -But, yes -- but the -- the

15

impact of your impeachment evidence would be related

16

certainly to if a juror would ask, well, why would he

17

lie about this?

18

the defense have any theory about what his motive would

19

be about whether he could identify somebody, whether

20

this first person had a mask or not?

21

And I -- I'm just asking, would -- did

MR. SHANMUGAM:

As this Court will be aware

22

from its recent consideration of eyewitness evidence, it

23

doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that an

24

eyewitness identification is mistaken that the

25

eyewitness was somehow lying about it.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

It may very well

Official

1

have been that Boatner made a mistaken identification in

2

good faith out of a desire to identify the person who

3

killed several of his friends.

4

And, indeed, as the amicus brief of the

5

Innocence Project explains in this case, there is a

6

phenomenon known as "mug shot exposure effect," where an

7

individual who sees a mug shot in some other context is

8

more likely to identify that same person when confronted

9

with a subsequent line-up.

Of course, where, as here,

10

the individual is exposed to the mug shot for the first

11

time in seeing a newspaper article that depicts the

12

individual in question and suggests that that individual

13

is a suspect in the crime, it would not at all be

14

unusual for the individual, when confronted with that

15

photograph again in a line-up a few weeks later, to pick

16

that individual.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the first time he -- he

18

said that the person wasn't masked and provided a

19

description was long before he saw any mug shots.

20

was the evening of the event.

21

questioned at the police station.

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It

It was when he was

Well, on the evening of the

23

event, he provided those limited details about the gold

24

teeth and the low-cut haircut.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, but by doing that he's
16

Alderson Reporting Company

saying this person wasn't wearing a mask.

2

critical point.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's the

Well, that may suggest that

4

the person was not wearing a mask.

5

possible that the person somehow had part of his face

6

covered.

7

Of course, it's

But I think it's important to realize,

8

Justice Alito, that even with regard to that statement,

9

while it is true that Boatner provided those limiting

10

details, he also made statements suggesting that he was

11

not confident of his ability to actually make an

12

identification.

13

at page 296 of the joint appendix, he says:

14

scared to look at anybody.

15

description.

And in that statement, which is found
I was too

I wish I could give y'all a

16

So, in some sense, we think that the focus

17

on the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut in this case

18

is a bit of an aside, because the question here is not

19

whether he saw enough to support the subsequent

20

identification; the question is whether his suppressed

21

statements in which he repeatedly said, I can't make an

22

identification, contradict his in-court confident

23

identification of Petitioner.

24
25

And we think that in order to decide this
case, all that the Court essentially need say in an
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opinion is that in a case such as this one, in which all

2

you have is the identification of a single eyewitness,

3

where you have statements in which that eyewitness said

4

I can't make an identification, and those statements

5

have concededly been suppressed, the Brady materiality

6

threshold is satisfied.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Am I right -In looking at the

The only even remotely relevant thing that was

which was a five-page document prepared by the officers

2

who initially responded to the scene, with a one-page

3

narrative of what took place.

4

the Court's reference, is in volume 10 of the initial

5

record that was received from the district court at

6

pages R1907 to 1911.

7

And that document, for

Now, with regard to these specific

8

statements, both the narrative statements and the

9

handwritten notes, the narrative statements were

10

contained in a relatively voluminous document -- I

11

believe it was an 83-page document -- that was a

12

narrative prepared by Officer Ronquillo that set out

13

everything that took place over the course of the

14

investigation.

15

And none of that was disclosed.

Respondent makes the argument that the trial

16

court reviewed that document in camera, but we think

17

that it is somewhat unclear what, if anything, the trial

18

court actually reviewed in camera.

19

that that document was not handed over to the defense.

20

There's no dispute

With regard to the handwritten notes, there

21

actually are a relatively small number of relevant

22

handwritten notes in this case, but all of them were

23

contained in the police files, and none of them, none of

24

the ones at issue on which we're relying, was handed

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No.

This Court has made

12

clear that a request is unnecessary to trigger the Brady

13

obligation, and this Court has made clear in cases

14

dating back to Brady itself that the good faith or bad

15

faith of the prosecutor is irrelevant.

16

the prosecutor has a duty under Brady to hand over not

17

only materials in the prosecutor's own possession but

My understanding is that

or perhaps semipermanent implants, and that in hip-hop

2

culture in the 1990s, this was relatively common.

3

whatever the provenance of this practice, it is

4

undisputed on this record that multiple other suspects

5

had those characteristics.

6

But

Justice Sotomayor, there was one thing you

8

remaining categories of evidence.

9

them out, and then I'd be happy to answer any questions

I just want to set

10

that the Court has about them.

And if there are no

11

further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.

12

As we explain in our brief, there are three

13

other categories of evidence at issue here.

14

the statement of Phillip Young, Petitioner's

15

co-defendant, suggesting that Petitioner was not

16

involved in the shootings.

17

statements that would have called into question the

18

prosecution's theory that Petitioner was one of the

19

shooters, a theory that was essential to establishing

20

the intent required for first-degree murder under

21

Louisiana law.

22

other States in that it doesn't require premeditation,

23

but that it -- but it does require a specific intent to

24

kill or inflict great bodily harm.

There were also the

Louisiana is somewhat different from

1

State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction

2

between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a

3

9-millimeter automatic pistol.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we don't think that

5

that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous

6

sources in our brief that draw precisely that

7

distinction.

8
9

But I think that what's noteworthy with
regard to the statements at issue is that both Boatner,

10

who identified the weapon that the perpetrator whom he

11

believed to be Petitioner was carrying, and the State's

12

ballistics expert, Kenneth Leary, who identified the

13

weapon that was responsible for the firing of the

14

casings at issue, conspicuously failed to say that the

15

weapon at issue was a 9- millimeter handgun.

16

trial their testimonies suddenly converged, and Boatner,

17

who had previously said only that the perpetrator was

18

carrying a handgun, said that the perpetrator was

19

carrying a 9-millimeter handgun; and Leary, who said

20

that the casings at issue had come from a machine pistol

21

of the Intratec or MAC-11 type, suddenly said that they

22

came from a 9-millimeter handgun instead.

23

But at

And so, at a minimum, if the defense had

24

possessed those statements, it could have sown doubt on

25

whether the firearm was in fact one and the same and,
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

therefore, sown doubt on a critical element of the

2

offense at issue.

3

And finally, the only other category --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'd just like to go back

5

to that because I'm not sure I understand the argument.

6

Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the

7

casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter?

8

that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was

9

used.

And I know

And the issue was whether anybody would call a

10

MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol,

11

correct?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that's right with

13

regard to Leary's testimony.

14

a little bit odd with regard to Boatner's testimony was

15

the sudden degree of specificity.

16

it was a handgun or a chrome automatic in his prior

17

statements, he said at trial that it was a 9-millimeter

18

handgun, which he had not previously said in the

19

statements that were withheld.

20

I think the thing that was

Having said only that

And, finally, the last category of evidence

21

consists of the notes of the interview in which Eric

22

Rogers relayed Robert Trackling's confession to

23

involvement in the shootings.

reflects that Mr. Boatner scrutinized those 72 faces.

At one point, line-up 11 was shown to him on March 22nd,

it's contained most specifically on page 191 of the

changed his mind, but he was presented with a line-up,

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

So, again --

It is your understanding

that the -- that all of Boatner's -- all the notes about

Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Alito, it is

It's clear that the court reviewed

20

something, but it is entirely unclear from that

21

transcript what the court reviewed.

22

even if the court had made an in camera determination,

23

it would no way -- in no way affect our claim after the

fact here.

My second point:

Justice Scalia, that there was more evidence here

linking Petitioner to the crime and relies on the

testimony of Eddie Young, the brother of Phillip Young,

5

the individual who was found at the scene.

6

substance of that testimony was that Phillip Young knew

But the sole

11

to the evidence in this case.

leaving aside this question of what the trial court may
