CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 10-209, Lafler v. Cooper.

5

Mr. Bursch.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There are three points that I would like to

10
11

press this morning regarding deficient plea advice.

12

First, this Court has consistently limited the effective

13

assistance right to ensuring the reliability of the

14

proceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and

15

sentenced.

16

standard.

17
18

Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice

Second, when asserting an ineffective
assistance claim, the defendant --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I -- can I stop you on

20

the first?

You say mere outcome is not enough,

21

reliability of the proceedings.

22

Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective

23

assistance, does attach to suppression hearings,

24

obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings

25

more reliable?

How does that fit with

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BURSCH:

Justice Kagan, even in

2

Kimmelman, the Court remanded back to the lower courts

3

to determine whether there was prejudice, and the

4

obvious implication was that if there was no prejudice

5

on the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself,

6

there would be no Sixth Amendment violation.

7

The second point that I wanted to press this

8

morning was that when asserting an ineffective

9

assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a

10

substantive or procedural right, and this Court has

11

already held that a defendant has no right to a plea

12

bargain.

13

Third, every possible remedy for deficient

14

plea advice creates intractable problems

15

demonstrating the right --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, isn't there a

17

right to make a critical decision on whether to accept

18

or reject a plea bargain, once offered?

19

right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a

20

right to make that kind of critical decision?

21

MR. BURSCH:

There's no

Justice Sotomayor, the -- the

22

not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's

23

constitutional rights.

24

that the Sixth Amendment contemplates.

25

situation is really more like Fretwell.

It's invoking the right to trial

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And so this
It's not a

Official

1

decision that you have, for example, whether to have a

2

jury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this

3

attorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in

4

each of those cases you have an underlying substantive

5

or procedural constitutional right; and you have no

6

right to a plea.

7

an illusory one, because you have no right to choose the

8

other side of the fork.

9

And so this fork in the road is really

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose this were a death

10

-- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure --

11

failure to communicate.

12

other question based on your opening remarks.

13

think about adjudication as having a constitutional

14

violation, injury, and remedy.

15

there was a violation in the abstract here but no

16

injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just

17

no remedy?

And that leaves me just one

Are you saying that

18

MR. BURSCH:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

that, including the death penalty, I --

21

MR. BURSCH:

We can

I'm saying -So if you could do all of

Yes, I'm saying that there's no

22

violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment

23

violation, you have to demonstrate unreliability of the

24

adjudicatory process.

25

reasonable remedy, and I'll talk about that in a minute.

I'm also saying that there's no

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

With respect to the death penalty in

2

particular, I would refer this Court right back to the

3

Fretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his

4

counsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection

5

that would have changed the sentence to avoid the death

6

penalty in that case.

7

before habeas process, and this Court held that the

8

defendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective

9

assistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because

Collins obviously was overruled

10

he had no constitutional right in it.

And so, really

11

the remedy -- I'm sorry.

12

doesn't enter the analysis once you've established that

13

there has been no violation.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The severity of the sentence

When you say no violation,

15

you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance

16

of counsel?

17

ineffective assistance.

18

I thought that was conceded, that there was

MR. BURSCH:

That's correct, Justice

19

Ginsburg.

20

that there was ineffective assistance.

21

is a two-part test, and even after you get past the

22

deficiency prong, there's still the question of whether

23

this casts some doubt on the reliability of the

24

proceedings.

25

We have conceded for purposes of argument

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Strickland

Well, I thought that the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

1

second part of the test asked about harm.

And here the

2

person is sitting in prison for three times as long as

3

he would have been sitting in prison had he had

4

effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining

5

stage.

6

of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?

So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements

7

MR. BURSCH:

Well, that's actually the best

8

argument that the Respondent has in this case.

9

reason --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. BURSCH:

And the

Sounds like a good argument.

Well, the reason why it's wrong

13

is because this Court has been very careful to define

14

what that harm is.

15

in Cronic and Strickland.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Specifically, the word was "outcome"

17

different outcome here.

18

three times as long.

19

If you -And outcome -- there is a

He's sitting in prison for

That's a different outcome.

MR. BURSCH:

Yes, but the Court went on to

20

define "outcome" to mean reliability of the adjudicatory

21

process.

22

whether absent the deficiency, the defendant -- I'm

23

sorry.

24

had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.

25

have here is a situation where everyone acknowledges --

In fact, specifically, the language was

cases.

4

jail for 1 day longer because his counsel was

5

ineffective?

6

there.

7

The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt

And if he is, we would find prejudice

So, why isn't the same thing true here?
MR. BURSCH:

Well, I don't believe it's quite

8

that simple.

If there was some legal error, you know,

9

an error to which he had a constitutional right, then

10

certainly what you said is exactly true.

11

talking about more or less days because of, for example,

12

a judge thinking that the -- the difference between

13

crack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other

14

things that are really up to the discretion of the trial

15

court judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are

16

not Sixth Amendment violations.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if you're

Well, I guess I don't

18

understand that answer, because that answer seems to

19

suggest that the -- that the assistance being provided

20

was not ineffective.

21

notes, you've conceded that the assistance is

22

ineffective.

23

much longer sentence.

24

the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough,

25

this is 10 years or something.

But here, as Justice Ginsburg

That assistance has led to a much, much,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

should be the end of the game, no?

2

MR. BURSCH:

Well, let's try another

sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was

4

deficient performance.

5

court judge and everyone knows that he has a certain

6

predilection that if you like the local sports team,

7

he's going to give you a break.

8

in and he does not press the argument that this

9

convicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets

Say that there's a local trial

If the attorney comes

10

a higher sentence, that's still not a Sixth Amendment

11

violation.

12

Really, once you shift to sentencing, the

13

question is, were you legally entitled to the result?

14

And simply because he failed to appeal to the right

15

discretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't

16

really make a difference.

17

obviously, about the guilt phase, and it's much easier

18

here because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic

19

and Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that

20

outcome difference, the harm difference, has to be

21

reliability of the process itself.

22

Here we're talking,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a process --

You acknowledge, though,

23

that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're --

24

well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged.

25

you:

Let me ask

Have you provided ineffective assistance of

1

counsel if you are a lousy bargainer?

2

good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game

3

of bargaining.

4

down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job.

5

that ineffective assistance of counsel?

6

You're just no

And so, you do a bad job in bargaining

MR. BURSCH:

Is

Under the Court's first prong of

7

Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the

8

standards of professional practice were, and depending

9

how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be

10

deficient.

11

any effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then

12

it would not be a Sixth Amendment violation.

13

But the important thing is if it didn't have

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't even agree

14

with the first part.

15

is -- is a bargaining game.

16

I don't think our legal process

MR. BURSCH:

Shouldn't be.

Well, we could agree with that.

17

Bargaining is not what this is about, and that's why

18

this Court has held in Weatherford and other cases that

19

there is no right to the plea bargain itself.

20

that's really the second --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

You can -- you can agree

22

with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are

23

disposed of by way of bargaining?

24

MR. BURSCH:

25

Because in the 95 percent of

cases that are disposed of that way, this Court has
10

already held in Padilla and Hill that there is a

2

constitutional right to have effective counsel when

3

you're accepting that plea.

4

you're accepting a plea, you're being convicted.

5

is the conviction.

6

establishes different tests when you're waiving a right,

7

for example the right to go to trial, versus invoking a

8

right, going to trial.

And the difference is when

And this Court frequently

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How can you talk about

10

the reliability of a process or its fairness when you

11

have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the

12

law?

into a trial thinking his client can't be convicted

14

because the shots fired hit below the waist?

How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going

15

MR. BURSCH:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

Because -So, how can that kind of

trial ever be fair?

hearing, if there's attorney error there, deficiency --

25

And this Court has drawn a bright-line rule
You know, if you look at the preliminary

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
a step.

Well, but you skipped over

I think we do assume that the deficient advice
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

led to the -- the determination to plead not guilty.

2

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

Again -- but that fork

3

in the road is not one to which he has a substantive

4

procedural right.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that's the

6

question -- that's the question we're confronting.

7

I think --

8

MR. BURSCH:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

So,

Well, I --- your answer was a

little too facile on that point.

11

MR. BURSCH:

I think --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We have to assume there's

13

ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client

14

the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client

15

can make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not

16

guilty.

17

MR. BURSCH:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19
20

Right.
We have to assume that in

this case, correct?
MR. BURSCH:

Correct, we are assuming that.

21

But what I would submit respectfully is that the plea

22

stage isn't any different than a preliminary hearing or

23

a line-up or a suppression hearing, where if there was

24

some deficient attorney conduct, this Court would still

25

then look to see whether it had an adverse impact on the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adjudication of guilt.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the defective

3

advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he

4

would not have entered if he had been properly advised.

5

Can he get relief?

6

MR. BURSCH:

Absolutely.

Under Hill and

7

Padilla, this Court has said when you give up your right

8

to trial, that's a very different situation and that

9

there is a remedy for that.

And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

So, explain why defective

11

advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective

12

advice causing defendant to turn down a plea --

13

MR. BURSCH:

It's just --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. BURSCH:

-- does not?

It's just like the difference

16

between deciding to proceed with counsel, in which case

17

there's -- there's no barrier to entry, or deciding to

18

proceed without counsel, giving up the constitutional

19

right.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, the difference -- that's

21

not the difference at all.

22

difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself

23

of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury

24

before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a

25

reasonable doubt.

It seems to me the

When you plead guilty, you give up
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that.

2

When you don't plead guilty, you get what is

3

the best thing in our legal system.

4

better than that.

5

MR. BURSCH:

You can't do any

Justice Scalia, you said it much

6

more artfully, but that's exactly the point I was trying

7

to make with Justice Ginsburg, that when you invoke your

8

constitutional right, your right to have an attorney, to

9

go to a trial, to have a jury, we don't set up barriers

10
11

to entry.

It's only when you give up those rights.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I take it, then, Mr. Bursch,

12

you would have the same answer if the State had never

13

provided counsel at all.

14

negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and

15

the individual defendant, and the -- and the State

16

refused to provide the individual defendant with

17

counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided,

18

oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's

19

all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?

20

MR. BURSCH:

So long as -- if the plea

That would be our position,

21

because that's consistent with this Court's holding in

22

Coleman and Wade and Kimmelman, that --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

position in a capital case?

25

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

And that would also be your

Under Fretwell, this Court

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

held definitively that so long as the reliability of the

2

adjudicatory process and sentence were intact, that the

3

deficient advice didn't affect it, that the severity of

4

the punishment was not legally relevant.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, your position is you're

6

entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you

7

plead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective

8

assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?

9
10

MR. BURSCH:

I would say it slightly

different --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. BURSCH:

All right.

-- that you are entitled to

13

effective counsel at every critical stage; however, it

14

is not a Sixth Amendment violation unless it casts doubt

15

on the reliability of the adjudication of guilt.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

question:

damnum absque injuria?

Damage without injury.

No, because under the Strickland

22

and Cronic cases, there is no damage, there's no Sixth

23

Amendment violation, unless you can prove the prejudice.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, all of this is

theoretically interesting, and it may be that capital
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cases are sui generis here.

2

your argument was that there just is no way to

3

unscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no --

4

and that was your third point, and I understood it.

5

MR. BURSCH:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I thought the heart of

Correct.
There is no remedy that can

7

put the parties back into the position where they would

8

have been had the error regarding the legal issue not

9

occurred.
MR. BURSCH:

10

That's exactly right.

And let's

11

talk about the two remedies that are most frequently

12

bandied about in the circuit courts.

13

order a new trial.

14

order a second trial after you've already had a first

15

error-free trial.

The first is to

And to us, it makes no sense to

16

In addition, you think about these habeas

17

cases; if you're issuing a habeas writ and vacating a

18

sentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here,

19

essentially you're releasing the defendant, because

20

witnesses will die, they'll move away, memories will be

21

sparse.

And so, that's the natural effect of that.

22

And in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even

23

advocate for a second trial; he asks for specific

24

performance.

25

infringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is

The problem with that is there you're

16
Alderson Reporting Company

sacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be.

2

circumstances have changed once a trial has taken place.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, "sacred" is a

4

little strong, don't you think?

I mean, it is a -- to

5

some extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows

6

already he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he

7

has to go back.

8

tell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer

9

if he wants, but then go through the normal process,

But why is it so terribly difficult to

stuff?

12

that.

I don't see what's terribly difficult about

13

MR. BURSCH:

We contend it violates the

14

separation of powers.

15

point because circumstances have changed in two

16

respects.

17

So, here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not

18

only did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it

19

while she was screaming and running away from him.

20

That's a changed circumstance.

21

same plea.

22

that he was picked for another criminal violation after

23

the plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he

would have taken the plea back when he knew that.

25

But you bring up an important

The first is that you learn more information.

He might not give the

trial itself, because the prosecutor has now gone

on the stand, something he tried to avoid with the plea

offer.

at what it is the Court's being asked to set aside.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. JAY:

Death.

Right.

So, in this case, you look

at the death sentence.

6

he got bad advice about the plea --

7

Let's say death.

How was that death sentence

9

moved on vacation and never told him about the plea

11

offer.

That's my hypothetical.
MR. JAY:

I think that's actually an easier

12

hypothetical than the bad advice because you could show

13

that if the lawyer then gets -- stands up and does a

bang-up job at trial, right -- the defendant is

convicted of capital murder.

I'm happy to do the capital case,

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll change my hypothetical

13

and say all that happened was that this perfect trial,

14

because of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison

15

for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which

16

would have given him 2 years.

17

48 years more, and I consider that that's at least

18

harmful to him.

of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal

clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it

21

that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate

assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, because we've said that

many times; isn't that right?
MR. BURSCH:

Well, the Court -- let me be

13

precise, Justice Kagan, because there are two things

14

that the Court can be talking about.

15

there's the -- the interaction between the State and the

16

defendant, and that's where the Court has customarily

17

used language like "critical stage," a confrontation

18

between the defendant and the prosecution.

There's the --

19

That's not what we have here.

20

private advice between the lawyer and the client, and

21

we're not contesting that he has a right to have that

22

advice be effective.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is about

What we have recognized,

24

right, is that plea bargaining is a critical phase

25

because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal

we've said.

that Mr. Cooper in this case had a right to receive

effective advice about whether to enter this plea.

critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment

what has -- what happens during that critical phase,

where if one outcome results, there is no Sixth

Amendment right, but if another outcome results there

is?

Wipe it out of your mind; you

get -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an

11

early point in -- in the investigation of the case?

12

MS. NEWMAN:

Yes, because what happens in

13

ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the State

14

has to bear the burden of the unconstitutionality.

15

so, that is a price that this Court has said the State

16

will bear when there is -- when there's a constitutional

17

violation, because there is no perfect --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

How can the judge -- the

19

judge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows

20

what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for

21

one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the

22

sentencing range is 81 to 135.

23

considering anything that happened at trial, the judge

24

knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man

25

had been charged with -- only with a felon in

31

possession.

2

MS. NEWMAN:

Yes, that's accurate.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, it -- it seems most

4

unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea

5

bargain for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.

6

MS. NEWMAN:

No, I would disagree with that.

7

This -- in this Court -- and I can represent to the

8

Court, in my practice before this Court, which I have

9

10

plea bargain was an ordinary plea bargain.

11

anything extraordinary.

It was -- it was a run-of-the-mill case --

13

This was not

It was very run of the mill.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That may be, but is it not

14

true that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon

15

in possession?

16

MS. NEWMAN:

I did not -- typically, you only

17

score out the guidelines for the most serious offense.

18

So, the guidelines may have been high for the felon in

19

possession offense, but, however, the judge -- in

20

fashioning the remedy, you're not going to -- this Court

21

would not take discretion away from the judge.

at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel

14

within the AEDPA meaning.

15

2

What do I do?

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If Justice Breyer permits

4

me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might

5

agree with him or a way of viewing this, as I read the

6

lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't

7

ineffectiveness because he was just trying to get a

8

better deal.

9

And I think that, translating what he said,

10

the very reasonable view by the court was the prosecutor

11

may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really

12

wanted to kill this woman, he would have hit her head or

13

her chest, but he aimed low.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why?

Why?

I mean,

5

why wouldn't the remedy be, as -- judging what you said

freedom to accept that or to reject it.

MS. NEWMAN:

the argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, if you're the

client is found guilty, then you can go back and say,

manner.

And so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the unanimity on

the remedy?

Here, the court said that the writ shall be

granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer

12

So, that doesn't bind the

14

MS. NEWMAN:

Correct.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it removes the

16

possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have

17

withdrawn that initial offer.

18

MS. NEWMAN:

Correct.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, the prosecutor -- the

20

remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform?

21

the prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does?

22

MS. NEWMAN:

Well, the remedies vary.

That

When I

23

said "unanimity," I didn't mean every -- every court in

24

every circuit does -- handles this exactly the same way.

25

Unanimity in the sense that every Federal circuit and
42

1

almost every State that has addressed this issue, and

2

they've addressed this issue for over 30 years, has

3

found that there is an -- there is a cognizable Sixth

4

Amendment violation that can be remedied on appeal.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And perhaps the lack of

6

unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate.

I

7

mean, people have been trying to suggest different

8

remedies.

9

question is to recognize that these cases present very

But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy

10

different factual circumstances, that there are a lot of

11

variation in them, and to give a substantial amount of

12

discretion to the lower courts to work out what the best

13

remedy is, consistent with that factual variation.

14

MS. NEWMAN:

Absolutely.

And it's the same

15

thing the courts have been doing, again, since

16

Strickland and Hill were decided.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Like what?

What factual

18

variation do you think justifies a categorically

19

different remedy?

remedies are good and some are bad.

Correct.

the remedy that the State -- I'm not sure I understand

MS. NEWMAN:

Well, in Mr. Cooper's case, I

20

think the -- the remedy in the Sixth Circuit is the only

21

appropriate remedy that -- that puts every -- that is

22

narrowly tailored to the Sixth Amendment violation, and

23

that's what this Court has said.

24
25

I mean, this Court has given direction to
the courts, to the lower courts, that you just narrowly

tailor the remedy to fit the situation, because there's

2

so many factual discrepancies --

out what Justice Scalia suggested.

there ineffective assistance, but also it would have

bargain.

the plea bargain open.

They then do it.

it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay?

Because I think,

2

yes, Justice Breyer's first statement, you have to prove

sense in -- in giving him a remedy that he --

10

back to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the

11

Chief Justice's question, on what basis can the judge

12

reject the plea?

13

put aside any information he learned during the trial.

14

And that's really the nub of this case.

15

grounds that you're proposing the judge can use to

2

So, how is a judge supposed to say -- I

mean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would

true or not?

10

provided the incompetent advice, told the judge in a

11

postconviction hearing that Mr. Cooper wanted to take a

plea.

13

question in this case.

14

I mean, there -- there is no -- it is beyond

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think the length and

15

the complexity of the trial has any bearing on this?

16

This was a relatively short and simple trial.

17

say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which

18

the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to

19

cost -- and it's going to cost a million dollars, and if

20

they try that case, there are going to be other cases

21

that they won't be able to try.

22

the case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy

23

is to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was

predicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MS. NEWMAN:

Of course, it is.

I'm saying it's unfair to say

16

that the trial erases the unfairness when there was no

17

possibility but for a conviction at the end of the road.

18

So, this was a certain guilty plea or this was a long

19

guilty plea under the math of a trial.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you can never say

21

that there's no possibility of acquittal.

decide not to convict no matter what the evidence.

MS. NEWMAN:

Juries can

There was no defense.

It's not up to us ex ante to decide this guy is

definitely going to lose; so, let's not waste our time.

3

Juries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not --

4

it's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide

5

for whatever reason we are not going to convict this

6

guy.

7

Right?
MS. NEWMAN:

That's true, but in this case,

8

Mr. McClain told Mr. Cooper he would be convicted.

He said:

Is it the case that, in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

most of the cases in which motions of this kind are

2

brought to trial, judges -- if there is a defense of

3

mistaken identity or of "I didn't do it," that judges

4

often find the defendant has not proven that they would

5

have taken the plea?

6

MS. NEWMAN:

Sorry.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I didn't hear the rest.
In most cases in which a

8

trial is had, where the defendant is pleading

9

misidentification or "I just didn't do this act," in

10

those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or

11

don't find that the defendant has met their burden of

12

proving that he or she would have taken the plea?

13

MS. NEWMAN:

I don't know that the cases bear

14

out that if you have a valid defense, it would be

15

harder.

16

hypothetical, that if you have a valid defense, it would

17

be a lot harder to be in this position of showing that

18

you would have taken the plea.

But I -- I would agree with that -- if that's a

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did you -- I mean --

MS. NEWMAN -- went to trial for an acquittal.

5

He went to trial because he believed legally his client

6

would be convicted of a lesser offense that would put

7

him in a better position than if he had accepted the

8

plea.

9

That was the only reason.

2

legally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the

3

person below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can

see a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend

5

to kill her.

6

Maybe that is not such a bad strategy.

7

Even if it's not

He shot her, you know, below the waist.

MS. NEWMAN:

Except the defense counsel on

this record specifically said that he -- that he was not

running a strategy and hoping for that, that he told the

client legally that's the only thing that could happen

11

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. BURSCH:

Thank you.

I'd like to start at

19

the one point where I think all of us, including counsel

20

on both sides, agree, and that's that a second trial

21

after an error-free first trial doesn't make sense.

22

that right there says a lot about Mr. Cooper's case,

23

because a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial.

24

And it's exceedingly strange that they're now saying

25

that I don't want a new trial.

And

That demonstrates that

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what they are claiming is not a Strickland violation.

2

I would like to address, Justice Breyer,

3

your suggestion that maybe you could have specific

4

performance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the

5

trial result could simply be re-imposed.

6

question is:

7

can tick off at least five.

8

And the

Well, what's the problem with that?

And I

First, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it

9

takes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the

10

plea, which he or she undeniably would have had the

11

right.

12

Second, as Justice Alito said, it ignores

13

that there's information that could be learned in the

14

interim.

Mr. Cooper shot three or four other people.
Third, it ignores the fact that an

15
16

error-free trial has taken place.

17

taken the risk of putting that 8-year-old sexual abuse

18

victim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away.

19

The prosecutor has

Fourth, as I already mentioned, we've got

20

the separation of powers issue and prosecutorial

21

discretion.

22

Fifth, we're going to have intractable

23

problems.

B.

25

trial.

Say the offer was plead to A, we'll dismiss

He rejects it based on deficient advice.

He is convicted on A and acquitted on B.
59
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

now we're going to try to enforce the plea on A?

2

mean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem.

3

there's intractable problems.

4

I
So,

The second point I want to make is about the

5

death situation.

And that's one we take very seriously.

6

And, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty

7

situation, there could be a due process right or some

8

other constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of

9

requiring something to be put on the record.

But what's

10

clear is that, under this Court's existing precedent,

11

that is not a Strickland violation because the amount of

12

the sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has

13

nothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory

14

proceeding and the sentence.

15

Finally, the last point that I want to make

16

is something else on which we can all agree.

17

is guilty of shooting Kali Mundy.

18

the sentence that the people prescribed for the crime

19

that committed.

20

holding him to that sentence.

21

it's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to

22

have a fair trial.

23

really the beginning and the end of this inquiry.

24
25

Mr. Cooper

He also got exactly

4

sentence inquire:

Is that good practice?

9

MR. BURSCH:

It could be good practice, but

10

it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even

11

if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the

12

problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer

13

gave to the client in private.

14

solve the core problem.

15

they're trying to claim that it was unfair to have a

16

fair trial.

17

And so, that doesn't

The core problem is that

When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter

MR. BURSCH:

respect to that?
