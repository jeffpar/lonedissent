ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Since this Court's decision in Katz v.

12

United States, the Court has recognized a basic

13

dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment.

14

seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own

15

home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle

16

when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment

17

protection.

18

his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not.

19

What a person

But what he reveals to the world, such as

In Knotts v. United States, this Court

20

applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper

21

surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public

22

roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of

23

privacy.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Knotts, though,

seems to me much more like traditional surveillance.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

You're following the car, and the beeper just helps you

2

follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance.

3

That was 30 years ago.

4

different, and you get a lot more information from the

5

GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.

6

The technology is very

MR. DREEBEN:

The technology is different,

7

Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that

8

shows that this was not simply amplified visual

9

surveillance is that the officers actually feared

10

detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to

11

Wisconsin.

12

the police broke off visual surveillance.

13

track of the car for a full hour.

14

to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a

15

helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio

16

transmitter in the can of chloroform.

17

The driver began to do certain U-turns and,
They lost

They only were able

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a good

18

example of the change in technology.

That's a lot of

19

work to follow the car.

20

beeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the

21

helicopter.

22

they -- they push a button whenever they want to find

23

out where the car is.

24

and find out everywhere it's been in the past month.

25

That -- that seems to me dramatically different.

They've got to listen to the

Here they just sit back in the station, and

MR. DREEBEN:

But it doesn't expose

2

anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed

3

to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that

4

was the crucial principle that the Court applied --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under that

6

rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the

7

man's overcoat or sport coat?

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Probably not, Justice Kennedy;

and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United

10

States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically

11

distinguished the possibility of following a car on a

12

public roadways from determining the location of an

13

object in a place where a person has a reasonable

14

expectation of privacy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

device.

17

and public buildings.

18

Oh, no.

This is a special

It measures only streets and public elevators

MR. DREEBEN:

In that event, Justice

19

Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the

20

installation of such a device would implicate either a

21

search or a seizure.

22

movements of somebody do not implicate a seizure.

23

But if it did not, the public

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- and on that latter

24

point, you might just be aware that I have serious

25

reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about

the way in which this beeper was installed.

2

get to that at -- at your convenience.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you can

Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to

get to it now.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. DREEBEN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Happy to, Your Honor.
I have to give a little

8

prologue to my question.

When -- when wiretapping first

9

came before this Court, we held that it was not a

10

violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth

11

Amendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in

12

their persons, houses, papers, and effects against

13

unreasonable searches and seizures.

14

just picked up conversations.

15

houses, papers, and effects.

And wiretapping

That's not persons,

16

Later on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you

17

mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is,

18

is there an invasion of privacy?

19

obtaining information that a person had a reasonable

20

expectation to be kept private?

21

I don't think that was the original meaning of the

22

Fourth Amendment.

23

for so long, we're not going to overrule that.

24
25

Does -- are you

I think that was wrong.

But, nonetheless, it's been around

However, it is one thing to add that privacy
concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

existed, and it is quite something else to use that

2

concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it

3

originally meant.

4

device is installed against the will of the owner of the

5

car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and

6

thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his

7

effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an

8

unreasonable search and seizure.

9

car against his will, and it is a search because what it

And it seems to me that when that

It is attached to the

10

obtains is the location of that car from there forward.

11

Now, why -- why isn't that correct?

12

it's a trespass?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Do you deny that

It may be a technical

14

trespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the

15

United States v. Karo, when a can of ether was

16

transferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio

17

transmitter --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but the owner of the

19

can at the time it was installed consented, and that is

20

not this case.

21

property to which this device was affixed.

22

was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously.

23

There is no consent by the owner of the

MR. DREEBEN:

In fact, it

But there was no consent to

24

the owner of the can once he acquired it to have it

25

contain a foreign item installed by the government.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

doesn't make it a trespass.

4
5

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean --

Well, this Court thought that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may be a sneaky thing to

do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass.

8
9

That

it --

6
7

Well, that's too bad.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, this Court thought that

it was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made

10

no difference because the purpose of the Fourth

11

Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful

12

interferences with possessory interests, not to cover

13

all technical trespasses.

14
15

And the case that I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, we've narrowed the

Fourth Amendment?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think the Court --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, the -- the privacy

18

rationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some

19

respects.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

It changes it, Justice Scalia.

21

And I think the case that most clearly illustrates the

22

distinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment

23

protection is Oliver v. United States, the case that

24

reaffirmed the open fields doctrine.

25

there was absolutely no doubt that the police committed

In that case,

2

fences, they ignored big "no trespassing" signs; and

3

this Court held that the interests that are protected by

4

trespass law are distinct from the interests protected

5

by the Fourth Amendment.

6

They entered, they crossed

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Undoubtedly, but the

7

rationale of that case was that it was not an

8

unreasonable --

9
10
11
12

MR. DREEBEN:

No, the rationale was that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- it was not an

unreasonable search.
MR. DREEBEN:

-- there was no search,

13

Justice Scalia.

14

open fields are not among the things that are protected

15

by the Fourth Amendment.

16

specifically focused on the distinction between trespass

17

law and Fourth Amendment law.

18

The rationale of that case was that

And the Court was very

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You think there

19

would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on

20

all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month?

21

You think you're entitled to do that under your theory?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

The Justices of this Court?

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

Under our theory and under
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this Court's cases, the Justices of this Court when

2

driving on public roadways have no greater expectation

3

of --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, your answer is

5

yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device

6

on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no

7

problem under the Constitution?

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, equally, Mr. Chief

Justice, if the FBI wanted to, it could put a team of

10

surveillance agents around the clock on any individual

11

and follow that individual's movements as they went

12

around on the public streets, and they would thereby

13

gather --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that seems to get --

15

to me to get to what's really involved here.

16

of whether there's a technical trespass or not is

17

potentially a ground for deciding this particular case,

18

but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's

19

presented by this case and will be presented by other

20

cases involving new technology is that in the

21

pre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy -- I

22

would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was

23

not the result of legal protections or constitutional

24

protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty

25

of traveling around and gathering up information.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

The issue

Official

1

But with computers, it's now so simple to

2

amass an enormous amount of information about people

3

that consists of things that could have been observed on

4

the streets, information that was made available to the

5

public.

6

that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much

7

doubt that in the near future, it will be possible -- I

8

think it's possible now in many instances -- for law

9

enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on

10

If -- if this case is decided on the ground

public streets without committing a technical trespass.

11

So, how do we deal with this?

Do we just

12

say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the

13

information that people expose to the public is -- is

14

fair game?

15

when that is -- when that is obtained because there

16

isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, but isn't

17

there a real change in -- in this regard?

18

There's no -- there's no search or seizure

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think, Justice Alito,

19

that there's a particularly dramatic change in this case

20

from what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases.

21

It is possible to envision broader advances

22

in technology that would allow more public information

23

to be amassed and put into computer systems.

24

think that the remedy for that -- if this Court agrees

25

with the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them
11
Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official

1

to this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as

2

when the Court held that amassing pen register data, all

3

of the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the

4

lengths of the times of the calls.

5

confronted in that case with Justice Stewart's view in

6

dissent, that --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Court was

There was a third party

8

involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case.

9

And, here, it's the police.

Essentially, I think you

10

answered the question that the government's position

11

would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we

12

leave our homes.

13

Is -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your

14

argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not

15

used inside the house, is okay.

16

So, the only thing secure is the home.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, we're talking here about

17

monitoring somebody's movements in public.

18

talking about monitoring their conversations, their

19

telephone calls, the interior of their cars, their

20

private letters or packages.

21

Fourth Amendment protection that this Court has

22

recognized.

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're not

So, there are enclaves of

What -- what is the

24

question that I think people are driving at, at least as

25

I understand them and certainly share the concern, is
12

that if you win this case, then there is nothing to

2

prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24

fallible; computers aren't.

8

That

But with the machines, you can.

10

So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like

interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe

13

overly.

14

I understand they have an

But it still sounds like it.
And so, what protection is there, if any,

15

once we accept your view of the case, from this slight

16

futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done

17

more so in their briefs?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, first of all,

19

this is exactly the argument that was presented to the

20

Court in Knotts.

21

technology in that case seemed extraordinarily advanced,

22

and there was a potential for it to be used.

Respondent --

If you go back to 1983, the beeper

So,

So, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept
your point there.

And what do you say is the limit?

MR. DREEBEN:

I first want to address the

suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between

10

a month and a trip and have a workable standard for

11

police officers to use.

12

of investigative techniques which in the aggregate

produce an enormous amount of information.

there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in

how they are --

JUSTICE BREYER:

And under a principle

Well, there is the same

20

kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court

that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I

think it's used for example in the bribing the judge

want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are

by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant?

When you're talking about the

5

movements of a car on a public roadway, which even

6

monitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no

In this case, there would not

9

monitoring the car.

And the warrant authorized things beyond just
It authorized entering the car in

10

order to install it, which wasn't necessary here.

It

11

also authorized monitoring the car in a location where

12

there was a reasonable expectation of privacy.

13

case is only about monitoring a car on public streets.

14

But I think it's very important to keep in

This

15

mind that the -- the principal use of this kind of

16

surveillance is when the police have not yet acquired

17

probable cause but have a situation that does call for

18

monitoring.

19

And I'd like to give an example.
If the police get an anonymous phone call

20

that a bomb threat is going to be carried out at a

21

mosque by people who work at a small company, the bomb

22

threat on an anonymous call will not provide even

23

reasonable suspicion under this Court's decision in

24

Florida v. J.L.

25

But you can hardly expect the FBI to ignore

MR. DREEBEN:

10

That's really

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

11

think that that goes considerably farther than our

12

position in this case, because our position is not that

permit monitoring within a private residence.

15

off limits absent a warrant or exigent circumstances

in this case, Justice Scalia, is this:

A tail -- if

12

they can -- if they want a tail, if they want to commit

13

I'm not addressing it purely as

a trespass.

Our view is the -- the use of a GPS as a

5

search in and of itself should be -- is -- should be

6

viewed as unreasonable.

that, we suggested in our brief some -- some

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that sounds like a

legislative line.

15

following somebody for 12 hours, let's say, and

monitoring their movements on a GPS for 12 hours?

43

MR. LECKAR:

Because -- because what you

3

have here is society does not expect that the police,

the human element, would be taken out of -- would be

5

taken out of the surveillance factor.

11

using social networking sites, and they will have on

12

average 500 friends, and they will have allowed their

13

friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365

14

days a year, through the use of their cell phones.

15

-- what would the expectation of privacy be then?

16

MR. LECKAR:

17

there are two ways of looking at it.

18

observed in Quon, cell phones are becoming so

19

ubiquitous, there may be privacy interests.

Well, the use of a cell phone,

good way to decide the case.

that the police had sneaked up to their car and put an
