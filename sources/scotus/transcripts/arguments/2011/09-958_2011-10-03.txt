ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARIN S. SCHWARTZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are many reasons why this Court should

13

not recognize a private cause of action to enforce

14

30(A), and I'd like to focus on three.

15

separation of powers.

16

Federal law, and it has not provided for -- for private

17

enforcement of 30(A).

18

administrative enforcement.

19

First is

Congress controls who can enforce

Instead, it has provided for

Second is the Spending Clause context in

20

which the case arises.

The very legitimacy of Spending

21

Clause legislation depends on the States' voluntary and

22

knowing acceptance of its obligations.

23

if Congress wants to provide for private party

24

litigation, it must do so clear and unambiguously, and

25

it has not done so in this case.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

For this reason,

Official

1

And third is the language of 30(A) itself,

2

which is broad and undefined and which includes

3

competing policy interests.

4

administrative enforcement, with all the expertise and

5

judgment and discretion and administrative know-how that

6

can be brought to bear.

7

These are suited to

These three principles all focus -- all

8

point to one conclusion -- that section 30(A) is not

9

enforceable.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Schwartz, the

11

government doesn't have the injunctive power -- as far

12

as California's rates are concerned, California puts

13

them into effect.

14

happening, even if the government thinks that they are

15

in violation of the Medicaid Act; is that right?

16

The government can't stop that from

MS. SCHWARTZ:

No, Your Honor, it -- it is

17

not.

I mean, in the sense that it can't go out

18

immediately and get an injunction, Your Honor is

19

correct.

20

a State --

However, the government has the power to deny

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but that's a very

22

drastic remedy, and it's going to hurt the people that

23

Medicaid was meant to benefit.

24

any injunctive power, or is its only -- only remedy a

25

fund cutoff?

Does the government have

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Well, its only remedy

2

provided by statute is to terminate funds.

is not a drastic remedy; it -- and it is the remedy

9

However, it

How often does it happen?
How -- how often has in

the Medicaid context -MS. SCHWARTZ:

Very rarely, and the reason

11

for that is because the way that most State plan

12

amendments operate is that these issues are resolved on

13

a consensual basis, generally within the 90 days

14

provided by regulation.

15

proves the rule.

16

This case is the exception that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it

17

the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the

18

administrative process, that you put your regulations,

19

your new rate schedules, into effect even before you

20

submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect

21

while HHS was considering them, and continued them in

22

effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by

23

injunction, even after HHS disapproved them?

24
25

MS. SCHWARTZ:

There is no end run here

because HHS's own regulations provide that our time for
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

submitting a State -- State plan amendment is within the

2

90 days that the amendment will take effect, and HHS

3

will confirm that -- this is the position of the Federal

4

Government that the State may implement its rate

5

reductions while the State plan amendment is pending.

6

It does so at the risk that, if a State plan amendment

7

is disapproved, that it may have to pay additional

8

funds.

9

We are entirely consistent with the administrative

But we did not do an end run around anything.

process.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could a State in its own

12

courts provide for procedures whereby adversely affected

13

parties could test the regulation?

14
15

MS. SCHWARTZ:

I don't believe so.

And

that's because in --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me you have to

17

say that.

18

Gonzaga, you wouldn't say that a State can entertain a

19

monetary cause of action.

20

with your position.

21

Otherwise the next question would be under

So, I think that's consistent

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Well, and I think what's very

22

important to focus on here is that this is not just any

23

Federal statute that's being enforced, but it is a

24

Spending Clause provision that is vague and ambiguous in

25

its terms.

It cries -- it has all these policy elements
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

to it, and it cries out for administrative review.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, when you say -- that

3

brings me to a slightly different point.

4

introduce the fact or the consideration of what's

5

administratively workable.

6

officials says quite to the contrary.

7

that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures

8

that are supervised by 50 people.

9

million each; and they say, we don't have time for this.

You -- you

The brief by the former HHS
It -- it says

That works out to 800

10

And it's much more efficient and it's much more

11

consistent with the application of -- proper application

12

of Federal law to allow this action to be brought in the

13

-- in the courts.

14

MS. SCHWARTZ:

I have two answers, Your

15

Honor.

One is that I don't think it is more efficient

16

to have 700 district court judges interpreting a statute

17

that does not have any objective standard but that is

18

susceptible to many different interpretations.

19
20
21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Schwartz, the

agency -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, that's "the

22

sky is falling" -- 700 judges.

It would be just each

23

district if it were in every district.

24

and certainly to the extent we are involving a State,

25

there would be only one State involved.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

And it -- it --

So -- so, there

Official

1

is just the State of California, and there are only four

2

districts there, and the suit could only be brought in

3

one.

4

think that the "sky is falling" argument really works.

So, I -- I think that's an -- you know, I don't

5

MS. SCHWARTZ:

But California is now subject

6

to standards that don't apply anywhere else in the

7

country, and I believe the Court acknowledged exactly

8

this problem just last term in Astra v. Santa Clara when

9

it declined to allow private parties to use a contract

10

provision to do an end run around Gonzaga,

11

Sandoval versus -- Sandoval v. Alexander; I think I have

12

that reversed -- and the other cases that, based on

13

separation of powers of principles, based on Spending

14

Clause principles, limit the -- the circumstances in

15

which private parties can sue.

16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you asking us to adopt a

rule that is good for this one case only?

18

MS. SCHWARTZ:

A --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

You gave -- or is there --

20

could you state the rule in broader terms or more

21

neutral terms?

22

And you gave three reasons why we should

23

reverse.

One, Congress hasn't created a cause of action

24

here.

25

action, never creates a cause of action in any case in

Well, Congress has never created causes of

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Ex parte Young line or cases like that.

2

The Supremacy Clause, because this is a

3

Spending Clause -- this was an act under the Spending

4

Clause.

5

Clause legislation can never pre-empt State legislation,

6

I take it.

7

But you're not asking us to hold that Spending

And then the language of 30(A), where you --

8

are you arguing that 30 -- that the Medicaid Act

9

affirmatively precludes any action like this?

I don't

10

understand that -- is -- is any of those arguments

11

sufficient by itself, or do you have to take them all

12

together, and you're asking for a rule that only applies

13

here?

14

MS. SCHWARTZ:

No, all of the -- all of

15

those arguments are sufficient, as is the fact that, as

16

we briefed, the Supremacy Cause itself doesn't supply a

17

cause of action.

18

points.

But let me focus on those three

19

These are points -- the rule that we are

20

seeking is that a Federal statute is not enforceable

21

unless Congress intends for it to be enforceable and

22

that that principle has special force with respect to

23

Spending Clause provisions where Congress has to clearly

24

and unambiguously provide for that enforcement, because

25

the State has to be on fair notice, due to the nature of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Spending Clause, of the obligations to which it is

2

agreeing.

3

even greater force with respect to 30(A) because of the

4

type of standards that it incorporates.

That is Pennhurst.

5

And that is applied with

If it's not suitable for -- if the

6

determination applying Gonzaga is that you're -- if

7

you're finding under 1983 the administrative nature and

8

flexible nature of those standards is not appropriate

9

for private enforcement, that shouldn't matter what

10

vehicle you are using to bring the case.

11

And I want to just -- to put this into real

12

clear context.

13

pending, California has submitted 68 State plan

14

amendments outside of the rate context.

15

them were approved.

MS. SCHWARTZ:

I don't know the answer to

2

that question.

These are non-rate -- rate-related

3

amendments, State plan amendments.

But the point is the

4

administrative process is working.

We obtained -- and

5

it resolves, in the usual case, in a consensual

6

resolution that is consistent with the cooperative

7

nature of the joint venture between --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Government.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's where I'm a

12

little bit confused.

you from implementing the rate changes until you got

14

approval from HHS in its administrative process that it

15

was going to approve the amendment, correct?

16

The injunction here only stopped

MS. SCHWARTZ:

No, I don't believe the

17

injunctions were that limited.

18

State plan approval, we then would have to go back to

19

the courts and argue over what the impact is of -- of

20

the State plan.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, if we obtained

That's a separate

22

question about whether the courts are required to give

deference to an HHS finding.

But the injunction here

12
Alderson Reporting Company

It just

Official

1

MS. SCHWARTZ:

No, the injunctions were not

2

so conditional.

3

is the injunctions have disrupted the administrative

4

process as it is intended to work by drawing out the

5

process, by politicizing the process, by prejudicing our

6

ability to get State plan approval because now there's

7

the concern about what about retroactive relief if we

8

approve your State plan --

9

And the -- and the point I want to make

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the courts, I take

10

it, have the prerogative, perhaps even the obligation,

11

under the primary jurisdiction rationale to simply

12

withhold adjudication until the agency acts.

13

MS. SCHWARTZ:

And we requested that in some

14

of these cases, and the courts ignored that argument.

15

And so, the upshot is that we are now --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's an abuse of

17

discretion, not an absence of power.

18

absence of power.

19

MS. SCHWARTZ:

You're arguing an

Well, there is no cause of

That's correct, Your Honor.

21

that there is no cause of action here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, can I go back to the

23

question that Justice Alito asked you about why there's

24

no cause of action?

25

Supremacy Clause differently from every other

You are asking us to treat the

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

constitutional provision.

2

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Why should we?
Well, for several reasons,

3

Your Honor.

4

the Court is doing here, is enforcing a Federal statute.

5

You look through the Supremacy Clause to the

6

obligations that --

7
8

First, when -- what you're doing here, what

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Supremacy Clause is part

of the Constitution.

9

MS. SCHWARTZ:

10

It is.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the Petitioners here --

11

excuse me.

12

that the Supremacy Clause as part of the Constitution

13

had been violated and sought, not damages, but only a

14

prospective injunction.

15

court shouldn't do what the court has done many, many,

16

many times before, tens and tens and tens of times

17

before, and say, yes, that's our prerogative and we'll

18

proceed to the merits?

19

The -- the plaintiffs here essentially said

And the question is, why the

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Two points, Your Honor.

20

First, they did seek damages, and they obtained damages

21

in Independent Living.

22

that are imposed, the study requirement, the data

23

requirement, all these obligations are imposed by 30(A).

24

You look through the Supremacy Clause to the statute to

25

see the obligations.

And second is the obligations

And so, the question is, does
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress get to control who enforces those obligations

2

or not?

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In a -- in a cause of -- in

4

a suit that's brought under a statute directly, a person

5

could be claiming damages.

6

A person is only claiming injunctive relief.

7

should -- there should be a difference between those two

8

in terms of when the cause of action is available.

9

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Here that is not the case.
And that

First, just one point:

In

10

Independent Living, they did claim damages, and they

11

obtained damages.

12

Your Honor, this Court has -- has the obligation and the

13

right with respect to constitutional provisions to

14

determine how they will be enforced, subject potentially

15

to congressional action, but there is far more latitude

16

for the Court.

17

this Court is explained in Davis v. Passman, deference

18

to congressional intent is appropriate.

19

But setting that issue aside, no,

With respect to statutes, of course, as

JUSTICE ALITO:

And here --

Well, suppose the plaintiffs

20

here were facing an imminent State enforcement action.

21

Would your argument be different?

22

MS. SCHWARTZ:

Well, if -- if the plaintiffs

23

fell within -- yes.

And if the plaintiffs fell within

24

the bill in equity to restrain enforcement proceedings

25

that was at issue in Ex parte Young and that Justice
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Kennedy has discussed in terms of the immunity to

2

invalid regulation, then the result would be different.

3

But there are several reasons why --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But how does that square

5

with the argument that you made that -- relying on

6

separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the

7

language of 30(A)?

All of those are still in play --

8

MS. SCHWARTZ:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

MS. SCHWARTZ:

For a couple --- in that situation.
Well, for a couple of

11

different reasons.

12

what you're asserting in such a case, is not a cause of

13

action.

14

powers concerns to the same degree as a stand-alone

15

cause of action to compel the State to comply with an

16

obligation owed to another entity.

17

First of all, a defense, which is

21

is a right to property or a right in the person.

22

there were other kinds of primary rights, but --

23

You have to have an invasion of what in old

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what that means
And

But what about the

24

providers who say, but under -- under the State law, if

25

we charge more than the hospitals -- if we charge more
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than the State ceiling, we are subject to sanctions, so

2

this does fit into the category of anticipatory

3

defenses?

4

MS. SCHWARTZ:

No, it does not, because we

5

have not threatened to enforce that statute.

6

not arguing that statute is -- is pre-empted.

7

the -- the statute that they are --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They are
They --

But wouldn't they be --

Someone charges more on the

10

theory that the rates are impermissible under the

11

Supremacy Clause.

12

sanction under State law.

13

MS. SCHWARTZ:

That person would be subject to

And that would be a different

14

case, and it would be a closer case, although even in

15

that context, because of the Spending Clause context in

16

which the case arises, I don't believe that they would

17

be able to challenge that as -- under the Supremacy

18

Clause.

19

But that is not this case.

That case at

20

least presents the fact -- and the reason why it's a

21

closer case is because in that case there is regulation

22

and we are potentially infringing on their property.

23

However, what's the law that they are trying to assert

defensively there?

the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that

have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I think that the great

6

majority of those cases are ones in which the plaintiff

7

in the suit in equity is bringing an action anticipating

8

an action at law.

We've had

They --- from this case.

I think that they -- though

15

that they do not reflect a general assumption that there

16

is a cause of action directly under the Supremacy

17

Clause, because as this Court said, the Supremacy Clause

is not itself a source of rights --

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think there is -- I think

I would also point out that this Court's

decision in Maine v. Thiboutot, which first recognized a

1983 cause of action, pointed to prior cases enforcing

Social Security programs, on the assumption that 1983

unwarranted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
I'd like to focus on two points that came

21

out of the questioning in the first part of the oral

22

argument today.

23

First of all, I would like to focus on the

24

question -- the comment, at least, and the question that

25

flows from it, from Justice Alito, which is that there
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has never been a recognition of a cause of action in any

2

Ex parte Young case.

3

and I didn't hear response to the other side that

4

suggests anything to the contrary.

And that's a hundred percent true,

5

And the reason for that is, obviously, what

6

this Court said in the Verizon case and what it said in

7

Shaw is that you look to the Supremacy Clause as the

8

basis for arising-under jurisdiction, and then if you

9

have jurisdiction, then you look to the traditional

10

equitable standards to determine whether they've been

11

satisfied in a particular case.

12

And under this Court's decision in Ex parte

13

Young, what the Court said was "an injunction which

14

restrains the state officer from taking any steps

15

towards the enforcement of an unconstitutional

16

enactment, to the injury of the complainant" is the

17

basis for relief.

18

that we have in this case, and thus --

19

And that's exactly the circumstance

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why isn't -- why

20

doesn't your position constitute a complete end run

21

around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence?

22

We've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out whether

23

there's an implied right of action under a particular

24

statute if there has always been one under the Supremacy

25

Clause?
30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, there is a

2

very fundamental difference between an implied right of

3

action or an action under section 1983 and -- and a very

4

simple and straightforward Ex parte Young remedy that's

5

otherwise available.

6

action, the district courts, the Federal courts, State

7

courts for that matter in enforcing them, have authority

8

to grant damages, they have much broader injunctive

9

relief, and under section 1983, there's --

10

Under 1983, at private rights of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How can they have

11

much broader -- broader -- first of all, all of those

12

cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly

13

a lot of them did include -- included claims for

14

injunctive relief.

15

authority under your equitable action under the

16

Constitution would be at least as broad as it would be

17

under the statute.

18

And I would have thought the court's

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Ex parte Young has been

19

pretty consistently evaluated as saying simply you

20

cannot do what the Constitution immediately prohibits

21

you from doing.

22

Young remedy has been a negative --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything

5

where the State law is pre-empted by the Federal law.

6

That doesn't sound very narrow to me.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, but -- but if you go

8

back and look at the cases in which 1983 relief has been

9

involved, a case like Blessing -- in Blessing, the

10

complaint there sought essentially to take over the

11

entire State law function of providing support for

12

children.

requested.

14

1983 carried with it a private right of action, that

15

would have been available relief; there would have been

16

a claim for damages in that circumstance; and there

17

would have been access to attorneys' fees.

And that was the injunctive relief that was

What if the law that

22

Congress is -- Congress passes sets forth certain

23

Federal standards -- it's a cooperative Federal-State

24

law like this one -- and it says:

25

private right of action for any individual to enforce
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And there's no

Official

1

this.

2

That's limited to the Federal Government.
MR. PHILLIPS:

In that -- in that situation,

there's obviously no authority to bring a private right

4

of action under the statute.

6

the Supremacy Clause --

7
8

11

That still doesn't answer

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, Congress can

say -MR. PHILLIPS:

between Federal and State law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

the same statute that confers the allegedly pre-emptive

13

Federal standards that we do not want individuals

14

bringing actions in court to enforce this.

15

leave that up to HHS.

Congress said that, individuals can nonetheless bring a

17

suit under the Supremacy Clause, the theory of which is

25

which there is a square and, in this case, you know, I

2

law, and the question is -- and that that conflict

3

imposes not only injury in fact to an individual but

4

also imposes irreparable harm.

if Congress loud and clear says, we want HHS to be the

7

sole enforcer of this law, you're saying--

view, right, that if Congress speaks to cut off a claim,

Is the default rule that

there is a Supremacy Clause action or that Congress must

14

expressly allow it?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

And the reason why the

16

default rule would almost certainly be that in fact you

17

can bring the Ex parte Young cause of action is because

the effect -- the Spending Clause has been subject to

notion that they contracted against this background of

Why?

I'm -- I'm not certain of

5

this.

I find this a difficult case.

It seems to me the

6

Government is prepared to concede that if an individual

7

has a Federal right that he'd like to enforce and

8

someone is trying to block it by asserting a State law

9

that he thinks is pre-empted, he can go ahead.

If it

looks as if the State is going to take something from

11

him that a Federal law guarantees and he has a defense

12

that he'd like to make to that under Federal law, the

13

State law that seems to allow it is pre-empted, he can

make it.

21

important in the context of this case to recognize.

22

We're talking about the issuance of a preliminary

23

injunction that was designed to hold everything until

24

matters could be avoided.

25

about a situation where the State, solely for budgetary

JUSTICE BREYER:

If I want your view, I want

6

these three possibilities.

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I want your view on

Right.

I --

One is the possibility the

judges just do it in all the different places, try to

10

figure out what's sufficient.

11

possibility that we try primary jurisdiction, and that's

12

the -- then the curlicue on that is what do you do

13

pending?

15
16

The second is the

And, you know, that's your injunction.
MR. PHILLIPS:

And that's what I just want

to be clear on.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, yes.

And the third

17

possibility is you say:

I'm just sorry that the -- this

18

is just too vague, the "sufficient" et cetera.

19

to be centralized.

20

all these different judges and different kinds of rates

21

and different kinds of provisions.

22

instance where you cannot bring your claim that

23

something violates the Supremacy Clause because you

24

don't have a Federal right to a thing, and they're not

All right.

Do you see those three

possibilities?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

Right.
And what I wanted you to do

is to address them.
MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- the third possibility,

8

it seems to me, Justice Breyer, is not much different

9

from a lot of the other cases that this Court has

10

already decided --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.
-- like Crosby and like

13

Engine Manufacturers, where there's the vague standard

14

out there, and the -- and it doesn't -- and they're not

15

asserting a right to be -- not to have an enforcement

16

action brought against them.

17

routinely held in that circumstance that there is in

18

fact a Supremacy Clause action available.

19

think the third option is really an option.

20

ultimately goes to the merits of the pre-emption claim.

21

And this Court has

So, I don't
And it also

If it turns out that all of this is just too

22

squishy to evaluate, then it would seem to me that on

23

the merits, then you would say there's not a clear

24

enough statement of Federal law to justify saying

25

there's a conflict that would -- and, therefore, you
39
Alderson Reporting Company

1

would lose on the merits.

2

from going into court and trying to make the kind of

3

showing that we made here.

4
5

But that wouldn't prevent you

JUSTICE BREYER:

You think primary

jurisdiction is the way to do it.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

You see, I see a practical

8

problem, and I'm -- the practical problem is millions of

9

rates all judged by the term "sufficient," and instead

10

of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we

11

do have a lot of judges.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

But, Justice Breyer, the

13

agency always has the ultimate authority here to step in

14

and take action.

15

it reasonable to think that Congress meant to place this

16

in an agency, in circumstances where the agency isn't

17

going to receive notice of the implementation of the

18

change before it gets implemented, where the State is

19

permitted to take no -- to make no response to a request

20

for information and allow the unlawful rates to go into

21

effect for years on end?

And I think the real question is, is

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

fighting Justice Breyer so much?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, it sounds like

you are, and that's why I am having some difficulty.

3

There are two points, following up on his

4

and then my second question.

5

General's suggestion that this isn't a cause of action

6

under the Supremacy Clause, but that it is a cause of

7

action under some implied equitable --

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Engage the Solicitor

Doctrine.
-- doctrine, okay?

10

Which may square.

And I'm now coming back to Justice

11

Breyer's question.

12

say about what the State did or didn't do here, but if

13

it's a primary jurisdiction question, what's wrong with

14

just saying that the court's power is limited under

15

equity to issuing an injunction that gives the matter

16

over to the administrative agency that puts in the

17

status quo -- assuming there's some sort of violation of

18

Federal law or seeming violation of Federal law -- a

19

preventive injunction that just stops the State from

20

acting until the administrative process concludes?

I agree with all you were trying to

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Sotomayor --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

What's wrong with that?

There's nothing wrong with

24

that.

Candidly, we -- we would be perfectly comfortable

25

with that, but I don't understand the other side to be
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complaining about the scope of the injunctive relief.

2

It is not that they are saying --

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no.

They're saying

you can't have any.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so --

But -- but Justice

7

Breyer's question, I think, was slightly different,

8

which is, what's the limit on --

9
10
11
12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the court's power?
And how do you -MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, we did have an

13

alternative argument that the injunction should --

14

should stay into effect at least until HHS acts, and the

15

-- the district court granted a broader preliminary

16

injunction and didn't consider the alternative argument

17

that was -- that was there.

18

But, again, it seems to me that, you know,

19

the court ought to recognize that you're in the context

20

of preliminary injunctive relief in this situation, and

21

-- and there will be plenty of time to kind of work

22

through the nature of the injunctive relief if in fact

23

the court's allowed to go forward and take up the Ex

24

parte Young issue under the circumstance.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you engage the

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question that -- the approach the Solicitor General has

2

been making, which is don't find a cause of action under

3

the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an

4

implied cause of action?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm not perfectly comfortable

6

with that rationale.

I think the answer is it's sort of

7

a combination of the Supremacy Clause and the -- and

8

broad equitable relief, rather than -- I mean, clearly

9

one or the other.

They seem to go pretty much

10

hand-in-glove in the ex parte line of cases.

11

don't have any particular problem with that.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, I

Well, I might, if you

13

continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy

14

Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a

15

-- a voice in enforcement in cutting it off clearly, if

16

Congress were to write a law that says no one can

17

enforce this, either in damages or in injunctive relief.

18

Your earlier answer seemed to suggest Congress didn't

19

have the power under the Supremacy Clause to do that.

20
21

MR. PHILLIPS:
were --

22
23
24
25

Well, I -- suppose there

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If this were in

equity -MR. PHILLIPS:

It will depend on the -- on

the circumstances of the case, but I do think there is
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some gap between the full extent of Congress's power in

2

this area and -- and the protections of the Supremacy

3

Clause, if for no other reason -- and because the

4

executive branch also has the authority and, certainly

5

acting within its own exclusive authority, could --

6

could pre-empt State law or could create a situation

7

where State law would be pre-empted.

8

Congress would have the authority to -- to take away the

9

Ex parte Young remedy under -- under those particular

10
11

And I don't think

circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What is your response to the

12

argument that the equitable power exercised in Ex parte

13

Young and similar cases is limited to certain specific

14

situations such as where there is an imminent threat of

15

the State enforcement action, and a few others where

16

there's a trespass, where there's a clearly defined

17

Federal right?

18

situation in which the plaintiff simply has Article III

19

standing and wants to obtain an injunction that a

20

particular State law is pre-empted by Federal law.

21

I mean, it doesn't encompass every

MR. PHILLIPS:

The -- I mean, to be sure,

22

the Court in Ex parte Young was dealing with a specific

23

situation of trying to prevent enforcement.

24

the Supreme Court -- this Court in all of its decisions

25

post-Ex parte Young has never said that that's the only
44
Alderson Reporting Company

But the --

Official

1

circumstance and has certainly never said that in

2

exercising the judicial power under Article III that

3

extends to all cases in equity, that it means only the

4

equity that existed in -- in the 18th century at that

5

point in time.

6

So, it seems to me the right answer at this

7

stage is for this Court to look at the situation and

8

say:

9

be appropriate?

Is this a context in which equitable relief would
And if you just use the preliminary

10

injunction standards, it clearly would be appropriate

11

under -- under these particular circumstances, where we

12

have a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable

13

harm, and the balance of harms favor the -- favor the

14

plaintiff.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, what is the best

17

authority in our cases, other than Ex parte Young, or in

18

a treatise or in recognized statements of the difference

19

in law and equity for the proposition that in this area

20

we can make a distinction between law and equity after

21

centuries in which we've tried to say that that

22

distinction ought to be blurred?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Well -I mean, do you want us --

would you want us to write an opinion and say, oh,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

there's a difference in damages at equity?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, all -- all we --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What do I -- other than Ex

4

parte Young, what do I cite for that?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, any of the cases in

6

which the Court has recognized that obviously in order

7

to get -- in order to get injunctive relief, you have to

8

demonstrate that there's -- that there's no adequate

9

remedy at law.

10

So, I mean, the distinction has always

been there, even after the merging of law and equity --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

That -- that's not --- in the early part of the

last century.

No, but I'm -- but I'm not

5

no State entity.

Gonzaga was a private institution.

MR. PHILLIPS:

I understand the Eleventh Amendment dynamic, which --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- as Justice Scalia

11

points out, was the whole driving force of -- of Ex

12

13

us to say that there has to be a law/equity distinction?

14

You say, well, that's because there is no adequate

15

remedy at law.

16

because there's no cause of action -- so, that doesn't

17

work.

18

Is there -- is there any other basis for

But that's circular; that assumes

No, but I -- I mean, all of

19

the cases that come out of the Ex parte Young line of

authority seem to base -- you know, they all tee off,

21

obviously, the problem that exists in this context,

22

which is -- which is the one that Justice Scalia

identified.

what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my

office and I look at the statute books and they are just

3

filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I had all

4

the State statute books, it would be 15 offices or 20 or

6

statutes, he can run right into court.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because Congress --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- Congress says in

3

a statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't

4

control.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but that doesn't --

6

that controls to the extent of trying to enforce

7

directly the Federal statute; it doesn't control with

8

respect to trying to enforce the Supremacy Clause.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The Supremacy Clause says

10

that judges in every State shall be bound thereby, but

11

if you want to amend it so that judges in every State

12

and all administrators should be bound thereby, then you

13

have a Supremacy Clause action against every Federal

14

agency.

15

That doesn't make sense.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no, but what the

16

Supremacy Clause says is that Federal law will be

17

supreme in all circumstances, notwithstanding State

18

law --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

that.

21

It doesn't say that.

22

Number one, it doesn't say

There's no -- it doesn't say "all circumstances."

MR. PHILLIPS:

The Supremacy Clause -- well,

23

I don't know of any exceptions in the Supremacy Clause

24

where State law gets to remain supreme to Federal law.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm -- well, no.

1

Scalia's question was related to a Federal agency.

2

Federal agency does something that's inconsistent with

3

the statute, arguably, and you say there's a Supremacy

4

Clause violation?

5

The

That's novel.

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, not -- not that -- not

6

what the agency has done violates the Supremacy Clause;

7

it's the State acting pursuant to what the agency has

8

approved, that if you still thought it violated Federal

9

law, would be a basis for seeking a Supremacy Clause

10

action.

11

-- the obvious solution to the immediate problem is to

12

seek review of the decision by HHS and to -- and to

13

follow it under those circumstances.

14

But, no, Justice Scalia is right.

The obvious

The -- the second point that I wanted to

15

focus a little bit about, because it does seem to me --

16

again, it goes to what are -- what should be the

17

background principles that operate here.

18

of Justices specifically raised the question of, you

19

know, would this case be different if we were seeking to

20

balance-bill -- that is, to bill the extent to which we

21

were allowed to bill prior to the time that the State of

22

California reduced by 10 percent, if we brought that

23

lawsuit, would that be perfectly permissible?

24
25

And a couple

And I understand California, I think, has
suggested that it would be, and I heard Mr. Kneedler
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suggest that, well, there might be some additional

2

issues there.

3

that shows you just how unrealistic the -- the

4

distinction is in this particular case, because we're

5

talking about individuals -- you know, the question is

6

not, you know, how are you going to implement this down

7

the road?

8

who is suffering a lack of access to vital medical care

9

in a way that is irreparable?

But the reality is, is it seems to me

The question is, what do you do with someone

And is it realistic to

10

think that Congress meant under those circumstances to

11

deprive the individual plaintiff of any kind of rights?

12

And the answer is no.

And that's -- that's

13

as far as the Court needs to go.

14

figure out exactly how far Congress could deal with the

15

Supremacy Clause.

16

skepticism on that score.

17

here, did Congress intend to deprive these plaintiffs of

18

their rights under Ex parte Young, the answer is no --

19

It doesn't need to

I realize that there is some
But on the core question

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The answer is yes,

20

they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under

21

the statute.

22

the proposition that this statute, when Congress was

23

specifically focused on the question of how to enforce

24

this provision, they did not provide a right of action.

25

And under our implied right of action jurisprudence,

I understand that you're not challenging

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that means there isn't one.
So, why when they're confronted with the

3

precise question did they say no, we don't want these

4

people to sue, but you say, well, they knew under the

5

Constitution they were going to be able to anyway?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because -- because there is a

7

difference between providing a private right of action

8

and all the bells and whistles that go with that, as

9

opposed to recognizing that Ex parte Young is the

10

background principle that has been in place for well

11

over a century and that says that when the -- when the

12

standards for equitable relief are satisfied, the courts

13

have the power, and they can prevent the violation of

14

the Supremacy Clause.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said you would be

16

satisfied with a limitation that the Court can issue an

17

injunction pending the administrative procedure without

18

going on to then the substance of the question, was

19

there compliance with 30(A) by California?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I

21

would have been perfectly comfortable with that.

22

mean, that was one of the alternative grounds for relief

23

that we sought.

24

down that particular path.

25

I

The district judge didn't happen to go

important element is to maintain the status quo ante

statute can be made, either by the agency or by the

4

courts.

5

allowed to do is simply to -- to permit this to drift

6

without any remedy and without any ability to get access

7

to medical care that's clearly inconsistent with what

8

Congress intended and where a remedy is available under

9

the Ex parte Young formulation.

this idea that there's a default rule that a Supremacy

7

and I'd like to identify two reasons.

8

First, the Suter fix.

That is

The -- Congress

acted, when this Court in Suter said that there was no

10

cause of action.

12

But we want to preserve the holding in Suter.

13

And it said just because something is

Well, it -- that suggests that other things

14

are unenforceable, that Congress is not legislating

15

against a backdrop of an assumption that there's an

16

injunctive relief claim, or it wouldn't have required

17

the Suter fix.

18

assumes -- that recognizes that with respect to Spending

19

Clause actions, the sole means -- the Spending Clause

20

statutes, the means, the vehicle for enforcing is 1983.

In Maine v. Thiboutot, another case that
