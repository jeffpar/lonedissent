CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Dutch Petroleum.

Mr. Hoffman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The principal issue before this Court is the

12

narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held

13

liable for violating fundamental human rights norms

14

under the Alien Tort Statute.

15

even if these corporations had jointly operated torture

16

centers with the military dictatorship in Nigeria to

17

detain, torture, and kill all opponents of Shell's

18

operations in Ogoni, the victims would have no claim.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under Respondents' view,

But, counsel, for me, the

20

case turns in large part on this:

Page 17 of the red

21

brief says, "International law does not recognize

22

corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here";

23

and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron

24

saying "No other nation in the world permits its court

25

to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation

2

has no connection."

3

And in reading through the briefs, I was

4

trying to find the best authority you have to refute

5

that proposition, or are you going to say that that

6

proposition is irrelevant?

7
8

MR. HOFFMAN:

couple of questions within that.

9
10

Well, there -- there are a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's -- it involves

your whole argument, of course.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

It does.

Yes.

And -- and let me start by

14

saying that the international human rights norms that

15

are at the basis of this case for the plaintiffs --

16

crimes against humanity, torture, prolonged arbitrary

17

detention, and extrajudicial executions -- all of those

18

human rights norms are defined by actions.

19

defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a

20

corporation or another kind of entity.

They're not

21

And so, I think that the -- the Respondents

22

are wrong when they say that international law does not

23

extend to -- to those kinds of acts.

24

does.

25

They do -- it

And the United States agrees with that position.
What they have tried to -- to conflate is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

the question about whether international law -- the

2

international law norms apply to a corporation or a

3

person with whether there's a -- an international

4

consensus with respect to how those norms should be

5

enforced, particularly within domestic civil

6

jurisdiction as opposed to criminal jurisdiction.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in -- in the area of

8

international criminal law, which is just analogous, I

9

recognize, there is a distinction made between

10
11

individuals and corporations.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, there's a distinction

12

made within the jurisdiction of certain modern

13

international criminal tribunals.

14

their position too far in this, because what they've

15

said is that the fact that corporations can't be found

16

liable criminally under the International Criminal

17

Court, for example, means that the norms, the underlying

18

norms -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war

19

crimes when it comes to the International Criminal

20

Court -- don't apply to corporations.

21

And Respondents take

And that's clear -- that clearly is wrong because

22

the United Kingdom and Netherlands, for example, the two

23

home countries of -- of these corporations has passed

24

domestic implementing legislation that imposes criminal

25

penalties for violations of those very norms.

Alderson Reporting Company

So,

Official

6
1

there's no question that it can be done.

2

What the most important -- I think one of

3

the most important principles in this case is that

4

international law, from the time of the Founders to

5

today, uses domestic tribunals, domestic courts, and

6

domestic legislation, as the primary engines to enforce

7

international law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

Mr. Hoffman -You began by --

by -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hoffman, I -- I

12

thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another

13

nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil

14

liability on corporations for violations of customary

15

international law, where the conduct occurred abroad,

16

the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not

17

a U.S. resident?

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the -- there are two

19

parts to -- to my answer to that.

20

Tort Statute is a -- is a unique way of enforcing the

21

law of nations, in terms of the way that the Founders

22

married tort law and violations of the law of nations.

23

One is that the Alien

In the international human rights amicus

24

brief, the amicus brief of international human rights

25

organizations, at pages 18 to 22, there's a whole series

Alderson Reporting Company

1

of cases where the domestic courts and domestic

2

legislation of various states around the world have

3

addressed those kinds of issues.

4

exact analogue to the Alien Tort Statute, but there's no

5

question that domestic legislation and domestic courts

6

have taken on these kinds of issues.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so, there isn't an

Well, there's no particular

8

connection between the events here and the United

9

States.

So, I think the question is whether there's any

10

other country in the world where these plaintiffs could

11

have brought these claims against the Respondents.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, let me address the -- I

13

think this comes under the general rubric of

14

extraterritoriality.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

to that question or not?

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

Is there a yes or no answer

I believe that they -- that

the answer to that would be "yes."

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Where?
I think that they could be

21

brought in Holland or the United Kingdom for events in

22

Nigeria.

23

those --

I think that the cases that are discussed as

MR. HOFFMAN:

I don't know if this precise

2

case could be brought.

I know that the -- we have a

3

principle of transitory torts, and so, one -- and I

4

believe other countries have that principle as well.

5

So, in terms of the underlying tort action, we have

6

plaintiffs who are U.S. residents and were U.S.

7

residents when they filed this case.

8

tortfeasor within the United States that they believe

9

was responsible for these torts.

They found a

And from Mostyn v.

10

Fabrigas and before, Mostyn v. Fabrigas being the 1774

11

case by Lord Mansfield talking about transitory torts,

12

the courts clearly have the jurisdiction to adjudicate

13

those kinds of tort claims.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -- if there is no

15

other country where this suit could have been brought,

16

regardless of what American domestic law provides, isn't

17

it a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself

18

contravenes international law?

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, that -- that issue has

20

been raised in a number of the briefs.

I would say two

21

things:

22

question about whether corporations can be categorically

23

excluded from Alien Tort Statute coverage, which is

24

really the issue that -- that was decided by the court

25

below and which was the question presented here.

One is that that doesn't really go to the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Extraterritoriality has to do with a different kind of

2

issue.

3

argued that that's an issue that ought to be briefed on

4

its own.

5

I would argue that -- I mean, we've obviously

But there is no international law principle

6

that I am aware of, and I think it would need to be

7

proved, that says that the United States Congress was

8

disempowered at its founding from providing these kinds

9

of tort remedies.

And it was clear from the founding

10

that the Founders at least believed that this statute

11

would be extraterritorial.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it was

13

motivated, I gather, by assaults on ambassadors here

14

within the United States.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it was motivated by the

16

Marbois incident and a similar incident to -- with

17

regard to a Dutch ambassador in New York at the time of

18

the Constitutional Convention.

19

looked to the Bradford incident -- the incident about

20

which Attorney General Bradford expressed his opinion in

21

1795, which was an opinion that this Court found very

22

important in terms of interpreting the Alien Tort

23

Statute, the Bradford opinion had to do with an assault

24

on the British colony in Sierra Leone.

25

not only extraterritorial in the sense of piracy, and I

But if -- if the Court

intended to deal with piracy and maritime-related

violations of the law of nations.

4

It -- the Bradford opinion there said, even

5

though U.S. criminal jurisdiction was limited, the civil

6

jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute provided that

7

the corporation that -- whose property was attacked

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Have all the judges who have

10

interpreted that opinion interpreted it the way you just

11

did?

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

The Bradford opinion?
Yes.
I'm not sure in which sense.

15

I mean, the -- yes, the -- I think that the Bradford

16

opinion has been used --

17
18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what did -- how did

Judge Kavanaugh interpret that on the D.C. Circuit?

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think -- I don't

20

recall specifically.

I know that there has been some

21

controversy about whether that was an attack in the high

22

seas.

23

I would suggest to the Court, if the Court went back to

24

the original documents that the -- that were sent to

25

Attorney General Bradford which -- from the British

I know there's some scholarship about that.

What

government, I think the Court would find that -- that

2

this attack actually took place in the territory of

3

Sierra Leone.
And so, one of the reasons that we've

4
5

suggested that -- that -- that the extraterritoriality

6

issue deserves full treatment if the Court is troubled

7

by it, in a case where there is full briefing, because

8

in this case it was raised by the -- by -- by the

9

Respondents' amici largely, although the Respondents

10

have raised it, and there -- the historians that have

11

expressed opinions on corporate liability and others

12

that would be interested in this question have not been

13

able to put the other side before the Court.
And I think there's a very -- there are

very -JUSTICE ALITO:

7

international tension.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the Alien -- if I could

start with the second part first.

The Alien Tort

10

Statute certainly was passed to do that but also as an

11

expression of the Nation's commitment to international

12

law, I think primarily as a -- as a statement of this

13

country's commitment to international law as a new

14

member of the community of nations.

15

look at the incidents like the Marbois incident --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you really that think the

17

first Congress wanted victims of the French Revolution

18

to be able to sue in -- in the court -- to sue French

19

defendants in the courts of the United States?

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think that what -- I think

21

the question would have been, is there a law of nations

22

violation?

23

the -- Marbois was -- was attacked by Longchamps outside

24

the United States, but Longchamps came to take refuge in

3

I think the United States -- I think the

4

same principle -- the United States would have wanted to

5

do something for the French government in response to

6

that because it would have been giving refuge to someone

7

who had violated the law of nations.

defendants or are corporate defendants also liable?

18

And I thought that -- that Sosa

So, I thought what we were talking

MR. HOFFMAN:

A lot of the

19

extraterritoriality issues would apply to the cases that

20

this Court endorsed in Sosa.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I agree that we can

22

assume that Filartiga is a binding and important

23

precedent, it’s the Second Circuit.

24

the only place they could sue was in the United States.

But in that case,

He was walking down the streets

3

In this case, the corporations have

4

residences and presence in many other countries where

5

they have much more -- many more contacts than here.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

And those issues, generally

7

speaking, are resolved by other doctrines, rather than

8

an exclusion of corporations categorically from the

9

statute.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I was -- the only thing I was

14

going to add to that is that a doctrine like forum non

issues about whether this is the most appropriate forum.

17

And those doctrines apply whether it's an Alien Tort

18

Statute case or it's a -- a common law tort case.

19

These plaintiffs could bring this case in

What the Alien Tort Statute does is

provide a Federal forum when these torts are in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in its

19

categorical ruling that a corporation may never be held

20

liable under the Alien Tort Statute regardless of the

21

nature of the norm, the locus of the wrong, or the

22

involvement of the state.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

explain to me the -- the difference between respondeat

25

superior liability and corporate liability?

Alderson Reporting Company

In -- in

2

respondeat superior liability is -- is permissible, and

3

the only issue is whether corporate liability is.

4

there a difference between the two doctrines?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think the difference

is really a matter of degree.

7

superior liability, a corporation is normally

responsible, liable for the acts of its agents.

category of cases, assuming that the ATS would allow a

common law cause of action for conduct in another

13

country, that maybe there should be more limited

14

respondeat superior principles because the action would

15

occur in circumstances were the corporation sought to be

16

held liable may not have much -- much control over it.

17

Where the corporation itself is liable --

18

and this would be true in criminal law and presumably in

19

-- in tort law -- would usually require some action by

20

those responsible for running the corporation or high

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.
When you say in your brief

3

that we should look at this as a remedial question, as a

4

question of enforcement, do you say that because you're

5

thinking of this as a vicarious liability case?

6

other words, there's an individual person who clearly

7

has violated a norm of international law, and then the

8

question of whether to hold the corporation liable is an

9

enforcement question.

In

Or would you say that it's also

10

an enforcement question when we're talking about direct

11

corporate liability?

I -- I think it's both.

13

Particularly the latter, but I think the former as well.

14

As Mr. Hoffman said, international law norms proscribe

15

certain conduct, but the enforcement of that is left to

16

each nation.

18

difficult to understand why we -- we would not hold

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

That's --

But I think, Mr. Kneedler -This is more specific than

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

It deals with a

10

much more narrow category of case.

11

that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be

12

interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if

13

indeed this statute provided for it.

14
15

MR. KNEEDLER:

And I do not think

Well, the court in Amerada

Hess did hold that, that -- and it made an important --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.
It made a point that is

18

important to this case as well.

It said that while the

19

Alien Tort Statute identifies who the plaintiff must

20

be -- the plaintiff must be an alien -- it does not

21

identify who the defendant may be, and that if there are

22

limitations on who the defendant may be from other

23

sources of law, and foreign sovereign immunity would be

24

one of them, then the suit could not go forward against

25

the foreign sovereign.

But, Mr. Kneedler, in Sosa,

3

of whether you were a state actor or not a state actor

4

might be relevant to the question of whether there was a

5

substantive norm that applied to you.

And I guess the question here is why that

same analysis doesn't apply to the question of whether

there is corporate liability?

a substantive norm that applied to corporations?

In other words, is there

In -- in fashioning Federal common law to

decide whether there should be a common law cause of

directs the Court to domestic tort law, and the question

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Ms. Sullivan, I think

that that's mostly because all of these are written to

prohibit certain acts, and they don't talk about the

actors.

19

as if somebody came and said, you know, this -- this

20

21

And you -- well, there's no case about Norwegians, and

22

it doesn't specifically say "Norwegians."

24

everybody from committing a certain kind of act.

MS. SULLIVAN:

But, of

But, Justice Kagan,

you correctly identified as a substantive question, not

violations.

6

of the financing of terrorism, which speaks about legal

7

entities, or the convention on bribery of public

8

officials, which speaks about legal persons.

9

And international law holds

Look to the convention on the suppression

But the human rights offenses here do not

To the contrary.

And, Justice Breyer, in precise answer to

your question about the convention on genocide, if you

5

And when Congress -- in the one time it implemented the

6

conventions that are the source of the human rights

7

offenses that are alleged here, Congress, in the Torture

8

Victim Protection Act, said that the suit may be brought

the term "persons," which could embrace corporations.

liability is a substantive norm that is established by

And, Justice Kennedy, over and over and over

10

again, as not just the Respondents' brief at page 17 but

16

Now, the international community has many

reasons for this.

established the ICC, the signatories actually discussed

whether to have criminal liability for corporations; and

as the Scheffer amicus brief in support of Petitioners

7

In answer to your question about -- earlier

about respondeat superior, Justice Kagan, the only way a

corporation can do anything is through the acts of human

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3
4
5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me just make a few

quick -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For all the reasons

6

Justice Kagan mentioned, that the TVPA is not a limiting

7

source and can be viewed as a supplemental source, but

8

there does appear to be a little bit of incongruity,

9

that aliens can sue corporations for acts against other

10

aliens, but American citizens under the TVPA might not

11

be able to sue corporations.

12

How do we deal with that incongruity?

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, there are a number of --

14

of differences between the TVPA and -- and the Alien

15

Tort Statute apart from that.

16

Alien Tort Statute applies to a much broader range of

17

international human rights violations.

18

to legislate in those areas for the reasons that it

19

decided to do that.

20

I mean, for example, the

Congress decided

The one thing that's clear, as Justice Kagan

21

said, is that the Torture Victim Protection Act was

22

designed to establish or to make even stronger the

23

Filartiga precedent and shield it from analyses that

24

challenged its bases, and was -- was not intended to

25

restrict the Alien Tort Statute in any way.

Alderson Reporting Company

And obviously, the next case will discuss in

2

greater detail whether the TVPA applies to corporations

3

or not.

4
5

If -- I don't know.
If I could just make a couple of additional

points.

6

If -- if it was true that international law

7

barred corporate liability, then our friends the United

8

Kingdom and the Netherlands have violated international

9

law by passing legislation that imposes criminal

10

liability on corporations for violating genocide, crimes

11

against humanity, and war crimes.

12

And I think that brief makes it pretty clear

13

that whatever they're saying, if -- if the Alien Tort

14

Statute is a domestic enforcement of international law,

15

then their views don't apply.

16

And -- and this is a tort statute.

That's

17

what -- there was a meaning to torts.

18

for example, was a tort not only under English common

19

law; it was -- it was a tort in violation of the law of

20

6

that can be done to violate the norm.
