ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON

MR. STEVENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. STEVENSON:

16

You haven't changed your

mind in the interim, have you?

13

15

Thank you,

haven't.

No, Justice Scalia, I

I do want to emphasize -- yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you start -- I

17

know that Enmund and Tison has to do with death

18

eligibility with respect to adults, but it does draw a

19

line between death eligibility with respect to

20

intentionality or not, or recklessness.

21

Assuming for the sake of argument that some

22

of us might be interested in whether a line should be

23

created for juveniles who intended or didn't intend

24

death, with respect to their eligibility for life

25

without parole, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, how
3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

would we write that?

2

the Enmund and Tison jurisprudence?

3

something different with respect to juveniles?

4

Would -- would we just import all

MR. STEVENSON:

Or would we say

Well, I -- I think you --

5

you could do that.

6

these statements that they're trying to exempt and

7

shield juveniles who did not kill, quote, "or did not

8

intend to kill."

9

organizing the Court's thinking on this issue.

10

In fact, in Graham, the Court makes

And that language could be a basis for

And, obviously, in this case where there

11

wasn't a requirement of the specific intent to kill that

12

was required in the Alabama case, that -- that might

13

dictate a certain different outcome.

14

challenge with that is that juvenile status, juvenile

15

intent, is a much more complicated issue, and that for

16

many of the same reasons that are problematic with how

17

kids function at the first stage of these trials, it

18

would be hard --

I think the

That has to do with your

20

general rule, which -- which we shouldn't impose it at

MR. STEVENSON:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

I think --- assuming we

bifurcate --

4

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, I hear --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- then -- then we still

6

have the question of when do we permit a mandatory

7

imposition of --

8
9

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I think there's no

question, Justice Sotomayor, there would be more

10

justification for those crimes where there is an intent

11

to kill, because this Court in its jurisprudence had

12

recognized that kind of hierarchy which you've outlined

13

and is exhibited in Enmund and then in the Court's other

14

cases.

15

Now, it's true that in -- in Arkansas under

16

this provision, an adult would still be subject to the

17

death penalty, because they used this "recklessness"

18

language so that even the focus on "intent to kill" that

19

we addressed in Enmund might not categorically protect

20

these other juveniles, which I think the Court can

21

rightly acknowledge have diminished culpability.

22

It's also worth noting that in many of these

23

States where there are children being sentenced to life

24

without parole, there is no confusion about this.

25

are being convicted of homicide offenses for which there

2

those provisions would likely be addressed by the Enmund

analysis.

No dispute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Those jurisdictions,

Well, in fact, Jackson

was convicted with a non-intent, just a felony --

6

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, it would -- you're

7

absolutely right that it's felony murder, but it's a

8

little different.

12

14

And here Kuntrell Jackson was subject to life without

15

parole.

16

And the Arkansas court has interpreted that to

The State argues that there was support for

17

that and even some kind of intent, because there was a

18

dispute about the words -- just quickly, you know, these

19

three --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. STEVENSON:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It doesn't matter.

Yes.
The jury didn't have

23

to -- all the jury found was that he didn't meet his

24

affirmative burden of proving.

25

MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official

1

exactly right.

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
they didn't make a finding --

4

MR. STEVENSON:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

And he didn't counsel --

That's exactly right.
-- as to what words were

used and what the intent was.

7

MR. STEVENSON:

That -- that's exactly

8

right.

And the dissenters at the Arkansas Supreme Court

9

relied on that in making the determination that they did

10

not conclude that intent had been established here in a

11

way that would support the judgment that -- that we

12

seek.

13

But that goes back to one of the earlier

14

questions that was posed about what happens at the guilt

15

phase.

16

Alabama and in most jurisdictions, you would not be

17

permitted to tell the jury what the sentencing outcome

18

would be.

19

isn't a lesser included.

20

the -- to the prosecution in -- in some of these crimes.

21

And there are a range of offenses for which that would

22

not help a jury kind of deal with the -- the kind of --

23

the choice that --

24
25

Is it -- Justice Kennedy, it is true that in

And in many of these cases, there -- there
That's going to be up to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that really -- is that

true under the law of Arkansas?

In most jurisdictions,

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I would think if -- if someone's charged with the

2

highest degree of homicide, the defense can request an

3

instruction on -- you don't have to have a separate

4

charge on a lesser included offense; the defense can

5

request an instruction on lesser included offenses if it

6

would be supported by the evidence.

7

MR. STEVENSON:

It -- it would really

8

depend, Justice Alito, on the facts.

For example, one

9

of our provisions in Alabama makes the -- the crime sort

10

of a -- a homicide, a capital crime, if the victim is

11

under the age of 14.

12

diminished culpability, some other kind of homicide

13

charge unless there's something else going on that would

14

support that.

15

has to be evidence in support of that lesser included

16

instruction before the court is constitutionally

17

obligated to provide it.

18

not a given that that would happen.

19

You're not entitled to some

Our laws and this Court's law say there

And so, for that reason, it's

And I think the challenge with the mandatory

20

scheme that we've been talking about in both of these

21

cases is that it does put the sentencer in a very

22

difficult situation, where there is no ability to

23

consider the age; there is no ability to consider the

24

factual diminished culpability that might exist in one

25

case or the other; no ability in either of these cases
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to consider the fact that an older codefendant got a

2

lesser sentence.

3

here that -- that goes beyond just the particulars of

4

this crime and this particular offender's culpability.

5

That there is something else going on

JUSTICE BREYER:

Before we leave it,

6

could -- what was the instruction the jury was given?

7

Was it you find him guilty if he was deliberately

8

indifferent, if he was recklessly -- what are the words

9

they used?

10
11

MR. STEVENSON:
to life.

12
13

It's a reckless indifference

JUSTICE BREYER:

If he was recklessly

indifferent to life.

14

MR. STEVENSON:

And if he gave aid or

15

assistance to someone in that capacity, and the

16

question, Justice Breyer, turned on -- on this statement

17

made that the -- the codefendant who testified against

18

Kuntrell Jackson --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

Yes.

-- initially told the police

21

he -- that he came in and said, "we ain't playin'," and

22

then he testified that he said, "I thought you all were

23

playing."

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
indifference means that.

I'm not sure reckless

Meaning, if he knew they were
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

carrying guns, doesn't that make him liable for the

2

reckless indifference --

3

MR. STEVENSON:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Well --- whether he thought

they would use them or not?

6

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, and that's what the

7

State argued here, is that the fact that he had

8

knowledge of this gun and that they went in there made

9

him guilty of reckless indifference even though it

10

didn't create the kind of intent to kill that -- that we

11

typically require for these kinds of showings.

12

That's again why there was a significance

13

around this language, that if you come in and you say

14

something declaratory that suggests that it's directed

15

at the victim, it might help kind of support that intent

16

finding if you don't --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Reckless -- reckless

18

indifference to life suffices for the death penalty for

19

an adult.

20
21
22

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

What -- what the Court

does -JUSTICE BREYER:

But -- so, you'd -- if

23

that's right, then we'd -- you would have to argue on,

if we took this tack --

MR. STEVENSON:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- which I don't know that

you could --

3

MR. STEVENSON:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's --- but that you cannot

5

sentence a juvenile to life without parole for murder

6

unless he, e.g., specifically intends the death or

7

something equivalent, but something stronger than

8

reckless indifference to life.

9

MR. STEVENSON:

That -- that's correct,

10

Justice Breyer.

11

knows its own precedents, but as you'll recall, Tison

12

followed Enmund, and in Tison v. Arizona is when the

13

Court allowed there to be this kind of room around this

14

intent standard in the way that you've just described.

15
16

And, again, I think that this Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, you would draw the line

at -- at a specific intent to kill?

17

MR. STEVENSON:

Again, my -- I would -- I

18

would categorically prohibit no matter what the intent

19

is.

20

What I think this case highlights, what's meant by "I

21

thought you all were playing" versus "we ain't playin'"

22

isn't a very good indicator of whether someone should be

23

subject to life without parole.

I think particularly for children at this age.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:
clearer?

What if it was a lot

What if they had said, okay, before we go in,

let's understand what's going on here; Shields has

2

got -- has got the sawed-off shotgun, and if we need to

3

use it, we'll use it; we'll do whatever it takes to --

4

to bring this off?

5

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I think the evidence --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

There might not be a

7

specific intent --

8

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- to kill there.

10

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

I think the evidence

11

that would support a finding of aggravated murder would

12

obviously be stronger, but even there -- and this is

13

what the Court points out in -- in Roper, the -- that

14

the decisionmaking of children, that the thinking of

15

children is categorically different.

16

thinking three steps ahead; they're not thinking about

17

consequences; they're not actually experienced enough

18

with the world to understand how they deal with their

19

frustrations in the same way that an adult is.

20

their judgments about what they intend to do, their

21

declarations, mean something very, very different.

22

And one of the factors that we haven't

They're not

And so,

23

talked about, but I just want to emphasize, is it's not

And because --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- I'm sorry; go ahead.

11

MR. STEVENSON:

And just because of that, I

12

think it does reinforce why even their judgments, their

13

so-called intentional judgments, reflect a very

14

different kind of understanding of their character,

15

their potential for rehabilitation, than it would with

16

an adult.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One of the arguments that

18

the State makes is that when you look at all these

19

numbers, the number that is most different between this

20

pair of cases and Graham is the denominator.

21

wondering whether you would address that.

22

denominator we should be using here and how it compares

23

to the denominators that we've used in past cases.

24
25

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

And I'm

What kind of

I think, first of all,

it is true that homicide offenses are -- are less common
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than non-homicidic offenses.

In Graham, this Court

2

looked at a range of non-homicide crimes, and that was a

3

huge number, 300,000.

4

talking about a multitude of offenses and here we are

5

talking about a single offense.

That's largely because we were

6

I think the fact that there have been 7,000

7

children arrested for -- for homicide and non-negligent

8

murder -- manslaughter over this 40-year time period and

9

only 79 children have been sentenced to life without

10

parole is a significant fact that reinforces our claim

11

that this is a very rare sentence.

12

And the fact that it's over 40 years, that's also true

13

for the 79.

14
15

That is 1 percent.

We got to that -JUSTICE ALITO:

It's arrests to start out

with; it's not -- it's not convictions.

16

MR. STEVENSON:

That's right.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it's not for the type of

18

offense for which one could be sentenced to life

19

imprisonment without parole.

20

homicide offenses.

21

MR. STEVENSON:

It's a broader category of

Well, you're absolutely

22

right, Justice Alito, on the first point, that these are

23

arrest data.

24

because, again, in this cohort, conviction data simply

25

is very difficult to get.

Of course, that's what we used in Graham,

But it's not true that only
14

Alderson Reporting Company

1

children arrested for aggravated murder are subject to

2

life without parole.

3

that create the largest population of these kids, all

4

kinds of homicide can subject you to life without

5

parole.

6

As I've mentioned, in the States

So, it is true -JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it true that in the

7

States that permit life without parole for a minor

8

homicide -- a minor murder, a person -- a minor

9

convicted of -- of murder, that that is permitted for

10

every non-negligent homicide?

11

MR. STEVENSON:

In some States, yes.

12

That is, to the extent that you are -- you get convicted

13

of murder, some of these States -- South Dakota and

14

Pennsylvania come to mind -- whether it's first degree

15

or second degree, you're subject to life imprisonment

16

without parole and it is a mandatory sentence.

appropriately, do we?
MR. STEVENSON:

6

Well, we can't get beyond

7

what the data tell us.

But I want to suggest it's no

8

less precise than what this Court had to deal with in

9

Graham.

In Graham, we talked about 380,000 non-homicide

10

offenders.

Half of that class were people convicted of

11

drug crimes, which no one has suggested would subject

12

you to life without parole.

13

14

15

when we made that comparison.

Another 60,000 were

And kids get into fights all the

But we used the aggregate of all of those numbers

So, I'd actually argue that we're dealing

16
17

here with a category definition that is much more

18

precise than what we dealt with in Graham.
And, Justice Kagan, to return to your

19
20

question we do have some precedents that help us with

21

this.

22

make an assessment about the propriety of the death

23

penalty for the crime of rape.

24

noted was that 9 out of 10 of the juries that made decisions

25

about life versus death chose life.

opponents want to defend that one.

14

Well, leave it up to the legislature.

15

Twelve years old?

Well, hum.

Now, maybe, your

Thirteen years old,

But suppose that -- that there's something

16

to be said for not leaving it up to the legislature, at

17

least for the numbers that were in that range.

18

would you defend the cutoff at -- for no life without

19

parole at, say, 14, older than 14, rather than older

20

than 15, rather than older than 13?

21

But how

What kind of argument is there that isn't

totally random for picking that number as the age below

24

most horrendous murder?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

I think two nonrandom

2

arguments can be made for two ages.

3

young age of 14.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. STEVENSON:

I'll start with the

Okay.
When you consider the fact

6

that 13 jurisdictions have thought about this and have

7

all but one set the age above 14, I think we can then

8

rely on that to make a determination that if there's a

9

minimum age, it's above 14.

10

I think we can also, consistent with this

11

Court's precedents, look at the frequency of the

12

sentence for this population.

13

sentenced a child to -- to life without parole for a

14

crime at 14.

15

States, there are no children 14 and younger serving

16

life without parole.

17

Court in a very nonrandom way to defend that judgment.

18

Most States have never

They've just never done it.

Thirty-two

And so, I think that allows this

But I also think a nonrandom argument can be

19

made to draw the line at 18; that is, offenders under

20

the age of 18.

21

in Roper.

22

What we've relied on about juvenile status is applicable

23

to that pool.

24

not quite as compelling.

25

That's exactly what this Court has done

It's what this Court has done in Graham.

I concede that these other indicia are

without parole.

with each of them.

Well -Or -- but there's a problem

So, that's where I'm trying--

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, but I guess just on

22

that point, Justice Breyer, I think you're right that

23

the indicia are more complicated, but I want to just

24

stress that they're less meaningful here, because with

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mandatory sentences, they don't tell you the same thing

2

they do in these other contexts.
But I also think it's true that we have

3
4

recognized that up until the age of 18, you are a

5

juvenile.

6

has recognized in these other cases.

7

it's defensible there.

8

developed than a child of 14 or a child of 10, it's also

9

true that you're not an adult.

10

Your status is coherent with what the Court
And so, I do think

While it's true that you're more

And we make that

distinction in lots of ways.
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Is there any other

12

distinction that you have been able to think of, growing

13

out of the literature or growing out of the law, where

14

the cutoff for some roughly comparable series of things

15

is between 14 and 15 or between 14 and 16, or something

16

like that?
MR. STEVENSON:

17

Well, yes, this Court in

18

Thompson made a distinction between offenders that were

19

under the age of 15, 15 and younger, then older

20

offenders.

21

country was you could not subject younger offenders to

22

the death penalty in ways that you could older

23

offenders.

24

and we've appended also lots of statutes, I mean, that

25

also make those kinds of distinctions.

And for 20 some years, the law in this

And so, there's clearly precedent for that,

20
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, we do

Official

1

draw these lines frequently in a range of areas, not

2

just dealing with the constitutional questions that

3

we're dealing with here.
But just kind of to complete my analysis,

4
5

Justice Kagan, about these comparisons, the other point

6

that I'll -- I'll reference is that, in Thompson, this

7

Court was also struggling over this question about

8

frequency and rarity.

9

actually look at the number of juveniles that were

And what the Court did there is

10

sentenced to death under the age of 16 that were on

11

death row and compared them to the number of people on

12

death row at the time, and they noted that it was

13

.36 percent of the population of people on death row.
If you did the same thing here, the

14
15

Sentencing Project reports that there are over 41,000

16

people in the United States serving sentences of life

17

imprisonment without parole.

18

number of 79 to that, that's actually, again, a lower

19

proportion of people serving life without parole than

20

the Court found to be constitutionally significant in

21

Thompson.

And if you compare our

22

So, I think Thompson and Coker all reinforce

23

what we're saying here, that this is an exceedingly rare

24

sentence where the majority of States have never chose

25

to impose it.

And that would provide a basis for this

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court to conclude that it is cruel and unusual.

JUSTICE ALITO:

In Coker --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stevenson, you're

There's no question that

What children intend, because

a very different question.
I don't mean to concede that it's an

3

irrelevant question.

I think the Court absolutely can

and should conclude that there is diminished culpability

5

in the Jackson case, and that's evident based on the

6

facts of the crime.

7

in the Jackson case that made this observation about the

consequences of crime.

14

will, these deficits in judgment, are not

crime-specific.

actually have any better judgment, any more character,

any more maturity, any more impulse control than the

Mr. Holt.

25

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT G. HOLT

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1
2
3
4

MR. HOLT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The decision below falls squarely within the

5

framework of Roper and Graham, and there are three

6

reasons to affirm this judgment:

7

worst of all crimes.

8
9
10
11

First, murder is the

Society has drawn that line.

Second, legislatures have the power to
authorize sentences that are commensurate with crimes
like murder.
Third, Jackson has not demonstrated any

12

consensus in this case against the practice, and, in

13

fact, there is a supermajority of States and of

14

governments that authorize this sentence.

15

The landscape of this case is -- is

16

different than Graham, because in Graham no one was --

17

no one was killed.

18

killed, because he acted with a reckless disregard for

19

human life as well, but it's an important thing in our

20

law that the law punishes the -- the result, the harm

21

that is inflicted.

Terrance Graham was lucky no one was

22

And if I could, go to the Arkansas statute.

23

Jackson was charged with the highest crime you could be

24

charged with in Arkansas -- it was capital felony

25

murder -- in that the legislature has set out several

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

enumerated, several violent felonies that if you commit

2

this particular crime -- and aggravated robbery is one

3

of them -- if you commit that crime and in the course

4

and furtherance of that, you or an accomplice act with

5

extreme indifference to the value of human life during

6

the commission of it or in the flight from it, then you

7

are guilty of capital felony murder.
So, in this case the jury was called

8
9

upon -- because there were other accomplices with

10

Kuntrell Jackson, they were called on to determine

11

whether or not Kuntrell Jackson acted as an accomplice,

12

whether he aided and assisted and whether or not he or

13

an accomplice acted with extreme indifference to the

14

value of human life.
In that process, Kuntrell Jackson asserted

15
16

the affirmative defense that essentially is available

17

for capital murder.

18

was not the triggerman, and I did not -- I did not

19

commit the homicide offense, and I did not aid or

20

procure counsel.

21

words of the affirmative defense are listed in our brief

22

at page 4.

23

He said that, I did not have -- I

All of those are listed -- the exact

And -- but he asserted that defense.
The Arkansas Supreme Court noted in its

24

opinion that in his challenge to the sufficiency of the

25

evidence, that there was sufficient evidence to convict

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

him of capital murder and that the jury was well within

2

its right to believe that he said that he -- that when

3

he walked in and took -- took the lead in this robbery

4

that he said, "We ain't playin'," and after that, the

5

clerk responded that she was going to call the police -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Counsel, I -- I know

7

that this seems like block building, but I think of law

8

as sort of logical.

9

you counsel the felony where someone dies, under

10

Arkansas law, you're guilty of felony murder, correct?
MR. HOLT:

11
12
13

If you're involved in a felony and

Of capital felony murder, yes,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

So, whether or

14

not that he intended to counsel the crime, he was guilty

15

of felony murder, unless he could prove the affirmative

16

defense, right?

17

MR. HOLT:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, obviously, he didn't

19

prove the affirmative defense, but that doesn't mean

20

that the jury actually found that he used one set of

21

words or another.

22

believe he had proven by his burden of proof that he had

23

not counseled, correct?

24
25

It just means that they didn't

MR. HOLT:

That's correct.

The Arkansas

Supreme Court said they could -- they could accept that

as -- they pointed to that as -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

jury.

MR. HOLT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As a possibility for the

As a possibility, yes.
But not that it was an

actual finding by the jury.

7

MR. HOLT:

No.

No, Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. HOLT:

All right.

It was not an actual finding

10

because an actual -- in regard to sentences in terms of

11

years, we don't require that individualized

12

responsibility that we do, for instance, in a death

13

penalty case.

So --

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Well -- so, in Arkansas, if

15

a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old is in a getaway car and

16

knowingly accepts the money that someone gets from a

17

robbery and intends to drive off with it, and that other

18

person shoots the teller and kills him, then that

19

individual who is 14 years old is guilty of felony

20

murder, capital felony murder?

21

MR. HOLT:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

Your Honor -He aided.

Is that right or

not?

24

MR. HOLT:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

If that's right,

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do -- do you think that such a person is less culpable,

2

knowing only that, than a person who actually takes out

3

a gun and shoots the teller?

4

MR. HOLT:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. HOLT:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Morally speaking.

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

Yes.
Now, if the answer to that

8

question is "yes," what is the argument for not being

9

able to tell that to the jury or judge who's going to

10

impose the sentence?

11

allowing a judge or a jury at least to think about that

12

question, before they have -- before imposing mandatory

13

life without parole?

14
15
16

MR. HOLT:

What is the argument for not

Well, Your Honor, that -- that --

telling a jury about that doesn't go to their guilt.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I know.

I mean, my

17

obvious point is that -- that the Arkansas system, once

18

we have he was the getaway driver or assisted the

19

getaway driver, they must sentence him at that age, or

20

despite that age, to life without parole.

21

And so, the other side is saying, well, at

22

the very least -- he has three other positions -- but at

23

the very least, the Constitution -- maybe it's the Due

24

Process Clause -- requires the sentencer to take that

25

into account, the fact that he was just the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assistant/getaway driver and may not have thought about

2

the murder in reality and may not have expected it in

3

reality.

4

sentencing?

Why not have to take that into account in
That's the argument.
I want to hear directly your answer to that,

5
6

which is taking the fourth or possibly the weakest of

7

his positions or the least radical.

8

to that one?
MR. HOLT:

9

What is your answer

Your Honor, it's -- a legislative

10

judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline

11

for -- for all murderers, whether they're juvenile

12

murderers, whether they're getaway drivers.

13

you -- when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets

14

you liability for being a capital murderer, then that's

15

the -- that is the minimum sentence.

And when

What he's gotten, on account of his youth,

16
17

is he's gotten -- this -- this Court decided in Roper in

18

that he could not -- he could not get the death penalty.

19

All of those individualized characteristics that would

20

get him the lesser penalty, he doesn't even have to put

21

on.

22

And that -- those are all those factors in terms of what

23

he -- what he might -- that might mitigate.

24
25

It's swept off the table because he is not exposed.

So, he would actually sort of be
double-dipping to come back again and say, oh, and by

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the way, I'm a youth, and so I should get even -- I

2

should get not the lesser punishment; I should get the

3

lesser, lesser punishment.
So, there's a certain symmetry that this

4
5

case has with -- with the Graham case, in that the

6

Graham case was very specific about the way it defined

7

itself.

8

majority opinion in Graham contained the word

9

non-homicide 47 times.

One commentator has made the note that the

Graham essentially said what it wasn't.

10

It

11

wasn't a homicide.

12

draws between homicide and every other crime.

13

crimes are -- the criminal statutes are scalar.

14

a certain amount of culpability that's built into each

15

one of those, whether it be capital murder or

16

first-degree murder or second-degree murder.

17

does go on what you know, the -- the knowledge that you

18

have.

19

immaturity is taken into consideration in capital murder

20

in that you can't get the worst -- if you've been shown

21

to do these acts, you can't get the worst punishment.

22

It was that other line that society

There's

MR. HOLT:

15

the specific -- there are specific crimes that a

prosecutor would move a case into an adult court.

different factors that include the severity of the

consideration the maturity of the -- of the youth,

23

that as a justification for your scheme, why couldn't

Alderson Reporting Company

In other words,

Official

1

all of the -- all of the discretion is up front before

MR. HOLT:

3

Well, there is discretion up

4

front, and that is the only -- that is the only instance

5

when a defendant can actually challenge a transfer,

6

where a prosecutor decides to put it.

7

also -- so, there is -- there's discretion at the front

end.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

But there are

I guess my point is, if

10

the concern is that -- that we have too indefinite

11

standards, too few specifics to guide the judge in

12

determining whether there should be a life sentence, the

13

same criticism could apply to the determination to send

14

him -- put him in the adult system at the outset.
MR. HOLT:

15

Well, Your Honor, the -- it is --

16

admittedly, it is at the discretion of the prosecutor on

17

those ages to move it into the -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

I assume discretion is

19

guided by certain standards, or it's no discretion at

20

all.

21

So, there are standards.
MR. HOLT:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

22

prosecutor -- that -- that decision to move it in there

23

is challengeable.

24

moves -- the juvenile moves it to transfer it to -- back

25

to juvenile.

It is reviewable by a court.

That is appealed.

He

That was done in this

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case, and then the Arkansas -- the Arkansas Court of

2

Appeals reviewed that decision and said that the

3

court -- the court's decision was not erroneous.

4

that -- that is the discretion that one would exercise

5

on the front end.

So,

Again, on the latter end, this Court has

6
7

said in Harmelin that the individualized sentencing is

8

not required, and, in fact, the -- all of the -- all of

9

the -- the mitigating circumstances that would -- that

10

have been considered because it's -- he's -- the death

11

penalty has been taken off the table.

12

that's a big deal, especially in a case like this one

13

where Kuntrell Jackson -- we believe the evidence showed

14

that he also acted with reckless indifference to the

15

value of human life, based -- based on the evidence in

16

this case.

17

he would be a Tison offender himself.

That's a big --

That he would be -- by way of analogy, that

But irrespective of that, the legislature in

18
19

Arkansas -- it's -- the legislative judgment has been

20

that the minimum sentence that a person can receive for

21

committing a capital murder in Arkansas is life without

22

parole.

23

I would like to clarify one point that I

24

think -- earlier that was made.

The two other

25

individuals in this particular case were -- one was a

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cousin who testified against Mr. Jackson, and he was 15.

2

He had turned 15 the day before this robbery.

3

second, the second individual, the triggerman, was -- he

4

was also 14, and he received a -- a sentence of life

5

without parole as well.

And the

It's our position that -- as is Alabama's,

6
7

that the main -- the principal justification in this

8

case lies with the -- the retributive principle that

9

society needs to convey the message that people like

10

Laurie -- that Laurie Troup's life, the victim in this

11

case, was more important than the money in that cash

12

register.

13

-- the punishment for this -- it's qualitative -- death

14

-- the death penalty is qualitatively different.

The harm here was irrevocable.

And this kind

But the punishment for -- for this crime

15
16

reinforces the sanctity of human life, and it expresses

17

the State's moral outrage that something like this could

18

happen.

19

what this message conveys, and it conveys it more as a

20

life-without-parole sentence than it does life-without.

21

We think that the respect due life is -- is

They have to let him make

And so, the argument here is basically,

10

well, the same is true when a 14-year-old, because of

11

the lack of maturity, faces life without parole.

12

that seems to me the hard issue in this case.

13

as -- just as the death penalty is unique for anyone

14

and, therefore, requires mitigating elements, isn't the

15

life without parole special enough for an adolescent

16

that you have to let him at least make any mitigating

17

arguments he wants?

And

Just

18

Now, Arkansas hasn't really expressed a view

19

in its legislation on that question, or maybe it has and

20

just rejected it.

Yes, Your Honor.

Did you say that Arkansas

has no life with parole?
MR. HOLT:

Your Honor, the only provision --

and this does go to show that Arkansas has thought about

13

this in ways, has taken deliberate steps.

15

that -- that a -- for instance, a 14-year-old in this

16

particular case, if -- if they had deemed that they

would go in extended juvenile jurisdiction, could

18

MR. HOLT:

No, Your Honor.
As I -- as I was saying, the -- there's a
certain constitutional symmetry to this case and to

Graham's case because -- because Graham committed a -- a

non-homicide offense and he was a youth, and so he had

twice-diminished punishment.

5

had -- he was -- he had twice-diminished culpability.

6

In this particular case, Jackson does not have

7

twice-diminished culpability.

But he only received one

He has -- he is a youth.

8

Even if he were to -- even if we were to say

9

that, well, he didn't pull the trigger, or we can't show

10

that he didn't -- that he acted -- didn't act with

was twice-diminished, he is still criminally

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. STEVENSON:

Just -- just a few points.

12

Justice Kennedy, I just want to kind of

13

remark, there is some literature out there about

14

commutation in Arkansas.

15

common up until 1980, and this case that my colleague

16

referenced was prior to that date.

17

been very uncommon.

18

since 2007 with the -- with the current governor, and

19

that was for a non-homicide offense.

20

And it was actually quite

But since then, it's

There's only been one commutation

I -- I also want to say, just kind of

21

consistent with my earlier argument, that this Court did

22

strike down mandatory death sentences in

23

Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana for

24

many of the reasons that the Court has highlighted here

25

that made that sentence unconstitutional and

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inappropriate.

And we think that in the same way, the

2

Court could certainly do that here.
But my final point is really to just say we

3
4

are not suggesting that States should not be able to

5

impose very harsh punishments and very severe sentences

6

on even children who commit these kinds of violent

7

crimes.

The State of Arkansas and the State of

8
9

That's not our position.

Alabama have parole boards in place.

They can even

10

impose sentences that give them the authority to

11

maintain control of the lives of these children for the

12

rest of their natural lives.
What we are arguing is that they cannot do

13
14

so with no hope of release, that that would be

15

incompatible with child status.

16

Roper.

17

be argued that every person is more than the worst thing

18

they've ever done.

19

decisionmaker might consider that in constructing what

20

kind of sentences to impose and what kind of regime to

21

create, and that's totally up to the legislatures.

And that's the rule of

That's the logic of Roper and Graham.

It could

And a policymaker and a

22

But what this Court has said is that

23

children are uniquely more than their worst act.

24

are quintessentially children in a way that the

25

Constitution requires that we respect their child

41
Alderson Reporting Company

They

Official

1
2

status.
And our argument is simple.

Our argument is

3

that it would be unusual to recognize that in virtually

4

every area of the law, but when a crime is committed, to

5

simply abandon it, to simply ignore it.

6

Graham teach us that we can't do that consistently with

7

our Eighth Amendment prohibitions.

8
9

Roper and

And so, for that reason, it is unusual, and
it's our judgment that it would be cruel to declare

10

these children fit only to die in prison given what we

11

now know about their status, about their development,

12

and about their potential.

13

And for those reasons, we would ask this

14

Court to reverse the lower court judgments and grant

15

relief in this case, Jackson v. Arkansas.

16

Stevenson, Mr. Holt.
