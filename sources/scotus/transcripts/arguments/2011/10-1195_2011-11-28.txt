ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NELSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Federal question jurisdiction statute,

12

28 U.S.C. section 1331, broadly grants Federal courts

13

jurisdiction over all actions arising under Federal law

14

unless Congress has provided otherwise.

15

jurisdiction encompasses rights of action that are

16

created and governed by substantive Federal law.

17

That grant of

The Telephone Consumer Protection Act sets

18

for forth such a right of action.

19

substantive standards, and it grants a private right of

20

action to recover for their violation.

21

that action to be filed in a State court if State court

22

allows such actions, but it says nothing one way or

23

another about whether the action may also be filed in

24

Federal court.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It provides detailed

The TCPA permits

Mr. Nelson, do you think
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there is a clear statement rule that applies when

2

Congress attempts to divest a Federal court of

3

jurisdiction over claims of this kind?

4

MR. NELSON:

Well, sometimes the Court

5

has -- has talked about clear statement rules in terms

6

like "Congress must make unmistakably plain."

7

sure it rises to that level, but what the Court has said

8

is that jurisdiction granted by statute exists unless

9

Congress has affirmatively displaced it and that the

I'm not

10

Court is unwilling to -- to defeat jurisdiction by mere

11

implication.

12

So, I think it -- it may be something a

13

little less than -- than what this Court has sometimes

14

referred to as a clear statement rule, but it is a

15

requirement that Congress act --

16
17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have anything more

than implication here?
MR. NELSON:

No.

There -- there's not even

19

implication here, Justice Scalia.

20

really nothing at all.

21

There's -- there's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you'd have --

22

the same private right of action that could be brought

23

in State court without subsection 5 at all, right?

24
25

MR. NELSON:
likely, Your Honor.

I -- I think that's very

I mean, under -- under Tafflin, and
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going back to the -- to over a century ago in Claflin,

2

there's a presumption that concurrent jurisdiction over

3

a transitory cause of action created by Federal law

4

exists in State courts.

5

Tafflin, that -- that presumption has sometimes, as in

6

the antitrust cases, been found to have been displaced

7

by implication from Federal policy.

8
9
10

But as the Court pointed out in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

you assert that you could bring this -- bring a Federal
cause of action in Federal court.

11

MR. NELSON:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

What is the basis --

Pardon me?
You think that you

can bring the Federal cause of action in Federal court.

14

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is -- what is

16

the basis for -- putting aside jurisdiction, what is the

17

basis for the Federal cause of action?

18
19

MR. NELSON:

Oh, you mean the existence of

the cause of action at all?

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

Yes.

I mean -- the -- you know, what

22

this Court has -- has, I think, said in its

23

interpretation of statutes is that where a statute

24

creates a right of recovery from A to B in a court under

25

circumstances Y, that is a right of action.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

And the --

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But we -- we said

2

that 40 years ago.

3

Congress must be fairly express in creating a private

4

cause of action.

5

against that context, that our cases require fairly

6

direct evidence, express evidence, that Congress meant

7

to give a private right of action, in that context the

8

existence of an express State cause of action or Federal

9

cause of action that can only be brought in State court,

10

the implication that there isn't one that can be brought

11

on its own in Federal court is fairly strong.

12

More recently, we've said that

And my -- my concern is if you put it

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think that's not

13

correct.

14

confusing the concept of whether there's a right of

15

action, which is a substantive right of recovery that

16

can be pursued in a court, and the question of

17

jurisdiction, which is in what court may that be

18

brought.

19

I think, Your Honor, that that is actually

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that -- I

20

understand that -- that proposition.

21

distinction is correct and that there is no

22

free-standing Federal cause of action, what good does

23

having Federal jurisdiction give you?

24

MR. NELSON:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Assuming that

Well --

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Because I take it

Official

1

that at that point everybody can immediately --

2

defendants can remove -- never mind.

3

Cross that off.

What benefit do you have if as soon as you

4

file your action, everybody says congratulations, you

5

have Federal jurisdiction, and you're kicked out of

6

court because you have no cause of action?

7

MR. NELSON:

Well, what I'm saying, Your

8

Honor, is that -- is that it is not in fact the case

9

that there's no right of action.

10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I'm

assuming that we don't see a cause --

12

MR. NELSON:

If there were no right of

13

action that -- that is available somehow in Federal

14

court, then, of course, it does no good to be in Federal

15

court.

16

rights of action.

17

right of action can be brought are not part of the right

18

of action.

19
20

But that's not how the Court has -- has treated
Limitations on the court in which a

They're matters of jurisdiction.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Can Congress create a cause

of action that does not arise under Federal law?

21

MR. NELSON:

No, I don't really think it

22

can.

Congress doesn't have the power to enact State

23

law.

So, if Congress creates a cause of action and --

24

and establishes Federal law that governs it, that is

25

necessarily a cause of action that arises under Federal
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there's no dispute that

3

there is a cause of action here that was created by

4

Congress; isn't that right?

5

MR. NELSON:

Yes, that -- that's correct.

I

6

mean, you know, this is not an implied right of action.

7

It's an express right of action.

8

227(b)(3) that if this right is violated, you can

9

recover X amount, $500 per violation or up to three

10

times that much in the case of a willful violation.

11

the question is simply whether by saying that it may be

12

filed in State court, the court has -- that Congress has

13

displaced the jurisdiction that would otherwise be

14

available --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Congress said in

All right.

And

So, the basic

16

reason seemed to me that it might mean "may," and I'm

17

following up on the Chief Justice here, who withdrew

18

this interesting part of his question.

19

Congress seemed to want to have ordinary people be able

20

to go into small claims court in a State and bring an

21

action for $500 because they were pestered by these

22

salesmen on the phone in violation of the Act.

23

The -- the

Now, if you're right, they could go into

24

Federal court.

But so could the defense.

25

case they bring in small claims court, I guess, could be

And so, any

removed, couldn't it?

2

about that?

3

And how is that -- am I right

MR. NELSON:

It's theoretically possible

4

that it could be removed --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. NELSON:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well --

-- Justice Breyer, yes.
Well, why wouldn't they --

8

I mean, you know, if they're really pests -- I'm not

9

saying they're all pests; some might be.

But if they're

10

pests and they want to drag it out, what they do is they

11

just remove it from small claims court.

12

lawyer:

13

what was Congress's objective, seemingly to provide a

14

simple, clear, easy thing for the average American to do

15

when he's pestered, suddenly becomes a major legal

16

problem since the defense lawyer is instructed remove

17

every case to Federal court.

18

that's bothering me.

19

response is.

20

They tell their

Remove everything, remove everything.

And so,

Now, that's something

So, I'd like to know what your

MR. NELSON:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

Well,

21

there are several -- several parts to the answer.

22

first is that -- that the strategy itself is

23

self-defeating.

24

by an individual in a small claims court, to pay a

25

lawyer, to pay the filing fee to remove it --

The

If you have a $500 claim being brought

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, it's not

2

self-defeating, because we keep it up, and the word will

3

get around.

4

MR. NELSON:

Well, when you're --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in case, by the way,

6

anyone doubts it, before he even files it -- one of the

7

things that we'll instruct our salesmen to say is:

8

you sue us, we're going to remove it to -- you know,

9

there are many ways of it getting around.

10

MR. NELSON:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. NELSON:

13

Well, Justice Breyer -Okay, what's the second?

To begin with -- now I want to

-- I want to -- I want to stay on this one because --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. NELSON:

16

If

Okay.

-- before I go on to the next

one.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. NELSON:

All right.

The -- the reason that that

19

strategy doesn't really work with respect to individual

20

plaintiffs filing in small claims court is they're not

21

necessarily -- in fact, they're most likely not going to

22

be repeat players.

23

find out about it, absent -- absent the -- the

24

telemarketer telling them in the phone call that you

25

have a right of action, which seems even more unlikely.

So, they don't have any real way to

10

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure I'm

2

understanding your answer, because I have one of the

3

same problems as Justice Breyer.

4

this statute, from what I can infer what the

5

congressional intent was, is for an individual person to

6

be able to go into small claims court.

7

defendant will usually be the telephone company that

8

wants to remove it to Federal court and, as

9

Justice Breyer said, instruct the attorneys always go to

Of -- the design of

And the

10

Federal court; the word will get out.

11

saying, oh, don't worry about that; that won't happen?

12

That will happen.

13

happen.

14

And you're

That's exactly what's going to

MR. NELSON:

Justice Kennedy, I think that

15

word getting out is very unlikely to happen if you're

16

talking about the individual, uncounseled --

17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Whether the word gets out

or not, they will all go to Federal court.

19

MR. NELSON:

But -- and I'd also --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we have any

21

information on the -- I mean, there are small claims

22

courts in State court.

23

removing $500 claims and paying much more than the $500

24

that's at stake?

25

MR. NELSON:

Is there any practice of

No.

No, Justice Ginsburg, and

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that was the -- the second part of the answer --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is there any reason to

3

think before you brought this suit that people thought

4

they could remove it to Federal court?

5

MR. NELSON:

Well, in fact, in the Seventh

6

Circuit, defendants have been aware for the past 6

7

years, I believe, that they can remove these claims to

8

Federal court.

9

large class actions.

10

And the ones that have been removed are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this -- in this case,

11

could -- could this case have been brought in a small

12

claims court?

13

Where does it come from?

MR. NELSON:

It comes from Florida, Your

14

Honor.

15

court for two reasons.

16

alleges 12 calls and more, and at -- at the $1,500,

17

trebled -- the 500 trebled, that would far exceed the

18

$5,000 jurisdictional limit of a Florida small claims

19

court.

20
21
22

It could not have been brought in small claims
The complaint on its face

The action also seeks injunctive relief,
which is not available.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Aside from the

23

individual ones, what's actually worrying me, which I've

24

tried to bring out, is I'm pretty certain Congress in

25

this statute was trying to protect the average person
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who can't afford a lawyer who is pestered with these

2

calls.

That's their object.

3
4

And I can think that if you can bring this
suit in Federal court, so can the defendants.

5

MR. NELSON:

And --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, therefore, I think,

7

gee, I'm not so sure about this.

They don't gain much

8

advantage, the plaintiffs, by being able to go into

9

Federal court, and there could be some advantage on the

10

defense side to making things more complex, raising

11

legal fees.

12

Okay?
So, that's where I am at this moment.

Now,

13

I'm asking you this because I would like your best

14

answer to disabuse me of this notion which cuts against

15

your case.

16

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think -- I think the

17

further thing that cuts against it, Justice Breyer, is

18

you've received three amicus briefs on the other side

19

from people who participate in the industry, and what

20

they all say repeatedly is that there are tremendous

21

benefits to both plaintiffs and defendants to being in

22

small claims court in the truly small claims.

23

The defendant -- you know, if the defendant

24

removes, it's the defendant that's going to be racking

25

up the legal fees, not the pro se small claims
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

plaintiff.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But why is that?

3

Wouldn't the -- I think you're fighting Justice Breyer's

4

hypothetical.

5

got a, you know, small claim type case because you got

6

the -- one of these calls, and the first thing you get

7

is the notice of removal and this.

8

to say forget about it; I'm not going to hire a lawyer.

9

Right?

10

Wouldn't the -- I can imagine if you've

I mean, you're going

I mean, the idea is they would drop it right

away.

11

MR. NELSON:

Well, I mean, the -- the

12

experience is, I think -- and there's an interesting

13

article in a -- in a publication called the Consumer

14

Finance Law Quarterly Report from the spring of 2002

15

called "Defending TCPA Actions in San Diego Small Claims

16

Court."

17

And there are some repeat players on the

18

plaintiffs' side in small claims court, and the advice

19

that the author gives is, whatever you do, don't try to

20

escalate with those people; don't even remove it up to

21

the -- to the State court of general jurisdiction,

22

because you're just going to find yourself in a morass;

23

it's going to cost you the defendant much more money to

24

move this claim out of small claims court.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could the -- could these

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

claims be brought in State court as class actions?

2

MR. NELSON:

3

Ginsburg, on the State.

4

recall, in the State of New York you probably couldn't

5

bring this action as a class action because of --

6
7
8
9

Well, that depends, Justice
As the Court probably may

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you could remove it

to the Federal courts, and then you could.
MR. NELSON:

Right.

In Federal court, I

think that although there's -- there's actually some

10

disagreement among the courts of appeals on this point

11

between the Second and Third Circuits over whether State

12

procedural law would apply in Federal court, we think

13

the best answer is Federal procedural law applies when

14

the claim is brought in Federal court.

15

States, there has been a recent decision in New Jersey

16

where a New Jersey court said that a class action was

17

not superior for --

18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. NELSON:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. NELSON:

24
25

But it's up to -- it's up

to the State.

20

23

Then in some

It's up to the State -Congress --

-- if it's brought in State

court, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress said you bring

it according to your law and your rules of procedure.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So, the State could make it -- Congress may have been

2

interested in the small claims court, but it certainly

3

didn't limit the States to bringing -- to putting these

4

claims in small claims court.

5

MR. NELSON:

No.

And -- and in fact, number

6

one, it probably couldn't.

Number two, the -- you know,

7

the statute creates rights to recovery and a right to

8

injunctive relief.

9

claim for relief that the private right of action gives

That's actually the first listed

10

you.

That is -- you know, injunctive relief claims are

11

virtually by definition beyond the scope of -- of

12

jurisdiction of small claims courts.

13

right of action that in some instances would be

14

appropriate for small claims court.

So, it created a

15

And I think the incentives are that -- that

16

those that are really truly small claims court matters,

17

they'll be brought there, they'll stay there.

18

that are not, cases where it's worth litigating in

19

Federal court or worth litigating in a State court of

20

general jurisdiction and claims that may be possibly

21

suitable for class action status will be brought in

22

other types of courts, such --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Those

Mr. Nelson, it's an odd

24

provision, this little clause, "if otherwise permitted

25

by the laws or a court of a State."
16
Alderson Reporting Company

What -- what is

Official

1

your account of that provision and what it's doing here?

2

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think -- I think what

3

it does is, principally, it displaces what would

4

otherwise be the rule of Testa v. Katt, that --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And why did Congress want to

6

do that?

I mean, you would think -- and this goes back

7

to Justice Breyer's point -- you know, most of these

8

claims, they're small claims, they typically are better

9

situated in a State's small claims court, and yet here

10

Congress says, well, the State doesn't have to entertain

11

these, in which case they could only be brought in

12

Federal court.

13

MR. NELSON:

Well, it's not clear that it

14

means, you know, how much freedom it gives them not to

15

entertain them.

16

an issue that the -- that the State supreme courts are

17

divided on, although it's a theoretical division at this

18

point because no State has actually precluded these

19

claims at this stage.

20

It may -- and again, you know, that's

But, you know, I think that, especially read

21

against the backdrop of the general principle that,

22

while States can't discriminate against Federal rights

23

of action, they're also not required to create courts

24

that have jurisdiction over them, that what this statute

25

was intended to do was -- was recognize the flexibility
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the courts would have to define which courts and

2

under which procedures it would entertain these actions.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the State thought

4

that its courts were just being overwhelmed by these

5

cases, even the small claims courts, there were so many

6

of them, would they be permitted to bar them completely?

7

MR. NELSON:

That's a possible reading of

8

the statute, Justice Alito.

9

Supreme Court has held.

That's what the Texas

In fact, the Texas Supreme

10

Court has held that the State has to affirmatively

11

authorize them.

12

that what it means by "if otherwise permitted" is if

13

there's a court of general jurisdiction that hears cases

14

like this and we haven't affirmatively excluded them.

15

And then some State supreme courts such as Illinois have

16

said we don't even have the power to exclude them.

17

I -- you know, that is one of the readings of the

18

statute.

19

Other State supreme courts have said

But

But -- but what's clear is that the "if

20

otherwise permitted" does mean -- mean something.

21

It provides a statutory standard for when the action may

22

be brought in a State court, which is a matter of --

23

it's certainly not superfluous.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But is it just when

the action can be brought in State court or when the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

action can be brought at all?

2

action -- and that's what I understood your basis for

3

the Federal cause of action to be -- if it's permitted

4

by the law or rules of -- of a court of that State.

5

MR. NELSON:

It says you may bring an

Well, I think what it says is

6

"may," may bring an action in the courts of that State

7

if otherwise permitted.

8

what the -- what reason Congress would have to put "if

9

otherwise permitted by State laws or rules of court,"

And I think if you think about

10

it's very unlikely that it would use that phrase to

11

denote --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. NELSON:

Well, there's a -- there's a

split in the circuits over that question at this point.

But my answer is yes, because it's -- it's a Federal

cause of action governed by substantive Federal law, as

the -- as the Second Circuit's opinion in Gottlieb held.

13

The implication of that is if there's any basis for

the Federal courts of that jurisdiction?

MR. GARRE:

We don't, and we haven't

contested that the action here arises under

But what you've got is the question of the

10

right of action here, in the same way the Court has

11

dealt with the interaction between section 1983 and

12

other private rights of action, for example, the City of

13

Ranchos Palos Verdes v. Abrams case.

context, the Court hasn't said, oh, if it's covered by

15

1983, of course you've got to bring it under -- you can

bring it under 1983 unless Congress has unmistakably

17

cleared that you can't.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And in that

But if you say, if you don't

19

contest the background principle, then the question is

20

whether Congress has clearly enough divested the Federal

21

courts of jurisdiction over this case essentially by

22

giving jurisdiction to the State courts.

23

a number of cases going the other way that suggest that

24

you don't divest one court of jurisdiction by giving

25

jurisdiction explicitly to another court.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

And we've had

And the

Official

question here is why is this any different, and has

2

Congress by granting jurisdiction to one court spoken

3

with the kind of clarity needed to divest the Federal

4

courts of their pre-existing jurisdiction?

MR. GARRE:

with the constitutional presumption of concurrent State

court jurisdiction.

8

is whether the -- whether the Constitution has been

9

displaced, this Court has required Congress to speak

And, of course, where the question

with unmistakable clarity.

11

where this Court is confronted with the question of

12

whether there's any similar presumption going the other

13

way.

14

presumption.

15

And for that reason we think the section 1983 paradigm

16

is more important.

17

This case is the first case

There's no constitutional foundation for that
It's just the interplay between statutes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But nobody has ever said

18

that Federal question jurisdiction as granted by 1331 is

19

some kind of junior sister when it comes to

20

jurisdiction, is some kind of weaker jurisdictional

21

default provision.

22

Federal question jurisdiction by 1331, that's the

23

background rule.

24

in the same way that the background rule is that the

25

State courts have jurisdiction.

I mean, once Congress has granted

5

the background rule provided by the Constitution.

6

our position is that usually when the Court talks about

Congress displacing, disrupting the traditional balance

8

of powers protected by the Constitution, it does require

Congress to speak with unmistakable clarity.

It doesn't apply that kind of presumption

provisions that allow the State attorneys general to go

into Federal court, and the FCC has its own enforcement

authority.

10

claim of the -- the violation, the wrongful conduct is

11

the same whether the Attorney General is suing, whether

12

the FCC is enforcing.

13

MR. GARRE:

I think the basic elements of

14

the cause of action are going to be the same, but State

15

law can limit the availability of that cause of action,

16

the ability to bring it in a court.

17

On your side, it's hard, and it's

an unusual statute, but the -- certainly -- and I agree

19

with you that the language of the statute suggesting a

20

kind of reverse pre-emption, something like that, and

21

certainly Senator Hollings' comment, and certainly the

22

fact that they specifically provide for an attorney

23

general to bring an action in State court suggests that

Well, ultimately, all of the

Federal circuits that have grappled with this problem

have concluded that recognizing diversity jurisdiction

isn't fundamentally incompatible with saying there's no

And

For two reasons, Justice Breyer.
What?

The first is amount in

8

controversy.

Diversity has an amount in controversy

9

requirement of $75,000, which makes it more likely,

10

where a plaintiff has that, it would be in a situation

11

where it would incur the costs of an attorney and other

12

expenses to go into Federal court.

13

no amount in controversy after --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Federal question has

That's true.

So, there's a

"flooding the courts" problem.
MR. GARRE:

Exactly, and the amount in

controversy checks that.
The second reason is that, to the extent

19

that Congress created this unique Federal right and

20

intended it to behave like State laws, as Judge

21

Calabresi described it on the Second Circuit, then it's

22

more natural to think of diversity jurisdiction allowing

23

the Federal courts to entertain what is in effect a

24

State cause of action than it would be for Federal

25

question jurisdiction where you have the anomalous
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

situation of someone going into Federal court and saying

2

I'm not bound by the State law limitations, for example,

3

the limitation on the class action, because I can bring

4

this Federal private right of action under Federal

5

question for $500 wherever it is.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

jurisdiction?

8

controversy.

9

I mean --

How about supplemental

private right of action to go into Federal court in the

18

unique way that you express it here.

10

first, it makes sense that they would authorize Federal

11

jurisdiction for the State attorney generals' actions

12

because they authorized the FCC to intervene there.

also makes sense that they said "exclusive" there

14

because there they were dealing with the constitutional

15

presumption that State courts have concurrent

16

jurisdiction unless Congress affirmatively says they

17

don't.

Congress was making clear:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

States, you have authority

I think, Mr. Garre, what

6

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Alito were suggesting, is

7

that this is a momentous thing for Congress to do to, to

8

deprive the Federal courts of jurisdiction over a cause

9

of action that has been created by Congress and a cause

10

of action that has Federal law as the rule of decision.

11

The usual presumption is that, of course, Federal courts

12

have jurisdiction over those matters under section 1331.

13

And this is one peculiar way of divesting

14

those Federal courts of jurisdiction.

15

Congress knew how to write an exclusive jurisdiction

16

statute.

17

Congress the benefit of the doubt and sort of say, well,

Congress must have had something else in mind, even

clause which modifies the "may."

18

any other case, I think, Your Honor, the Court would

read the "if otherwise permitted" clause as modifying

the "may" and, therefore, the entire right of action.

JUSTICE BREYER:

parallel, because there you've got a venerable, general

2

provision, section 1983, which is actually older than

3

1331, and the question comes along from time to time

4

whether a later-enacted Federal right can be enforced

5

through 1983.

6

although we generally presume that you can go through

7

1983, if there's a later-enacted specific enforcement

8

mechanism, we give the facts of that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the Court, in that context, says

And how specific does it

cases to end up in small claims court?

I think, if you look at the City

15

of Rancho Palos Verdes case, which I would encourage you

specific as my friend is claiming.

I think you look at all signposts of

19

congressional intent.

Here you've got the language

20

which is unmistakably distinctive.

21

State-court-focused.

where Congress, when it wants concurrent jurisdiction or

Federal jurisdiction, it says so.

expressions of intent displace it here.

Can we go back to your

jurisdiction with constitutional presumption, you have

2

an earlier-enacted Federal statute, 1331, and the

3

later-enacted statute, the TCPA private right of action

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but the difference is

6

that the 1983 cases don't deal with what this deals

7

with, which is displacement of the jurisdiction of

Federal courts.

And we are jealous of our jurisdiction,

you have to be clear when you take cases out of the

ultimately there is no Federal question jurisdiction;

4

that although it arises under 1331, the specific

5

provision here was never intended to be enforced through

6

1331 and, instead, was only authorizing State courts.

7

Our position is that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you're saying that a

8

State could, if it chose, say we're only going to award

9

actual damages, not the $500 statutory --

10

MR. GARRE:

No, I don't think the State

11

could actually alter what Congress said.

It can -- it

12

can alter, as Congress said, the ability to bring a

13

right of action.

14

Now, I do think this Court could affirm --

It could

choose not to enforce that Federal right of action.
MR. GARRE:

And in that case, a private

bring this action on behalf, or go to the FCC and bring

an enforcement action.

public ways to enforce that.

There are public rights --

19

position -- we agree with our friends -- that this is an

20

odd statutory provision.

21

effect to its language, which both sides agree is odd

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I guess that's the

2

question, Mr. Garre.

3

all nine Justices agree it's odd, I mean, I think we can

4

say this statute is odd.

5

we go from there?

And where -- you know, what's the

6

default position?

If it's odd and we can't figure it

7

out, the default position seems to be Federal courts

8

have jurisdiction over Federal questions.

9

If both sides agree it's odd, and

MR. GARRE:

And the question is, where do

But I think that that

10

deprives -- yes, it's odd, but it's odd in a way that

11

one must presume that Congress actually meant what --

12

what it was doing in several different ways here.

13

think it gets to a point where you just can't presume

14

that Congress didn't mean the impact of its words here.

15

So, we would urge this Court to give effect to them.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

I

MR. NELSON:

I want to start where Justice

23

Kagan left off, which is the presumption of the

24

existence of Federal jurisdiction unless Congress

25

affirmatively displaces it.
55
Alderson Reporting Company

1

My friend suggested that that may not apply

2

or may not apply as strongly when we're talking about

3

Federal statutory jurisdiction and specifically 1331.

4

But this Court's decision in Colorado River, cited in

5

our reply brief, says exactly the opposite:

6

subsequent more specific Federal statute does not

7

displace the general grant of Federal jurisdiction under

8

1331, absent -- absent some clearer indication than the

9

mere existence of an optional State court jurisdiction

10
11

that a

over the claim.
As to the oddness of the statute, a point on

12

which we all seem to now agree, the point I would make

13

there is I think that Respondent's position makes this

14

statute even odder, because it suggests that somehow

15

"may" means it may only be brought in Federal court, yet

16

it doesn't mean it may only be brought in Federal court

17

if there's diversity or 1367.

18

But as Judge Easterbrook said in Brill, if

19

"may" really means "may" only, then it wipes out

20

diversity and 1367 as well.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are you arguing only

22

about "arising under" jurisdiction or are you arguing

23

also about a Federal cause of action that can be brought

24

in Federal court?

25

out what we're being asked to decide in this odd case.

In other words, I am trying to figure

1

I understand the idea -- and I'm sorry to take up your

2

time -- I understand the idea that this is a Federal

3

question because it's created by a Federal law.

4

Can you go -- get into Federal court, and

5

then we'll have another case about whether you can bring

6

a cause of action there?

7

MR. NELSON:

Well, I certainly hope not,

8

Your Honor.

I mean, I think if you look at what the

9

question presented is and what the judgment below is,

10

it's a question of subject matter jurisdiction, a

11

12(b)(1) dismissal, and a question presented as to the

12

existence of 1331.

13

get people into Federal court so that they can be told

14

that they have no right of action.

15

that point is that the -- the reference to State courts

16

in the provision is not a limitation on the right to

17

recovery.

18

But, you know, our point is not to

And the answer to

19

action that refer to a particular court.

20

the Federal court in -- in every case but this one.

21

as in RICO, as in the Carmack Amendment that was the

22

subject of the 1912 case of Galveston, Harrisburg, and

23

San Antonio Railway cited in our briefs, where the

24

Carmack Amendment said that persons damaged might make

complaint in any circuit or district court of the United

States.

And the Communications Act provisions that we

2

cite on page 10 of our reply say people have certain

3

rights to recover, and they may bring them in Federal

4

court.

5

But those references to the courts have

6

never been considered to be a limit on the right of

7

action.

8

obtain a recovery creates a right of action, and it's

9

transitory; it can be brought in any court of competent

11

court that has jurisdiction over it does not mean that

12

the -- that the cause of action somehow does not exist

13

outside of that court.

14

And the reference in the statute to a

The cause of action exists, and the question

15

is, is whether there's a jurisdictional basis.

And

16

that's practically at this point, I think, been

17

conceded, that this statute arises under Federal law.

18

And there's really no indication whatsoever that merely

19

by saying "may" be brought in State court, that Congress

20

intended to displace Federal jurisdiction or to create a

21

right of action that, uniquely among Federal rights of

22

action, is only available in the State court.

23

Now, it's true, "may" -- or "if otherwise

24

permitted," as my friend said, modifies "may," but it

25

doesn't just modify "may" in isolation.
58

It's "may"

what?

May if otherwise permitted bring an action in

State court.

3

the conditions on which the action may be brought in

State court.

5

import State court rules into whether the action is

6

available in a Federal court.

So, the "if otherwise permitted" modifies

Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that that's the only

section that creates a private right of action.

MR. NELSON:

That's right.

right of action is created, but the private right of

action is not contingent on that "if."

to bring it in State court.
