ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In its previous decision in this case, the

12

Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a

13

license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable

14

part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable

15

public obligations.

16

obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress

17

has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to

18

enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.

19

One of those enforceable

Respondents in this case have for years

20

benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use

21

of public spectrum.

22

Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their

23

licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting

24

indecent material when children are most likely to be in

25

the audience.

They argue, however, that neither

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, General Verrilli, it

2

seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only

3

go so far.

4

something, now they have to do whatever we say, you

5

wouldn't accept that.

6

condition appropriate when many other conditions would

7

not be appropriate?

8

you would say all conditions are appropriate.

9

I frankly think you wouldn't.

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I mean, if the idea is just we gave them

So, the question is why is this

I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, if
But I --

This condition is

11

appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a

12

defining feature of the broadcast medium from its

13

inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has

14

continued to be a defining feature of this medium

15

throughout its history.

16

friends on the other side are making here is that that

17

norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been

18

recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been

19

applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be

20

overturned now because circumstances have changed.

21

And I would point out first, if I may,

22

And the argument that my

something that --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's one of their

24

arguments.

I mean, another one is that you haven't

25

defined it precisely enough, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Yes, that's true.
That's a separate -- really

a separate argument.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's certainly true,

5

Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness,

6

if I -- if I may just continue on this line.

7

The -- their argument is that circumstances

8

have fundamentally changed.

I want to point out at the

9

outset something I think is significant, which is that

10

their argument would sweep away indecency restriction

11

with respect to radio as well as television, and they

12

would sweep that away in the arguments they are making

13

today without making any showing that circumstances have

14

changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or

15

accessibility of radio.

16

And I think if one looks at the FCC orders

17

that this Court cited in its prior decision in this

18

case, one will see that a lot of the most vile and lewd

19

material really is in radio.

20

that marker down at the beginning here because I do

21

think it is quite important.

22

about radio.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, I just want to put

No showing has been made

I didn't quite understand

24

that.

Today there's a -- there's either a potential or

25

a fact of violent and objectionable broadcasting in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6

radio?

I didn't quite -- just to understand your point.

2
3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Pacifica itself,

Justice Kennedy, was a case about a radio broadcast.

4
5

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, I understand that.

Yes.

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And the Respondents are

7

arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled

8

because the circumstances that justified its rule no

9

longer obtain.

I want to put a marker in at the outset

10

here with respect to radio, because I do think it's

11

quite important, that they haven't made any argument

12

that those circumstances are any different with respect

13

to radio.

14

isn't even any argument that there's blocking technology

15

available.

16

vile material that the record demonstrates has been

17

transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses

18

on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are

19

making here.

20

It's just as ubiquitous as it was.

There

And I want to make sure, given the kind of

Now, with respect to television, I do think

21

they're making an argument that -- that television

22

broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way

23

that it was before.

24

but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument

25

than one would normally get in support of a -- the

They're not making an argument --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis.

2

They're not -- they're not arguing that

3

broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was.

4

If anything, it's probably more pervasive now.

5

not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no

6

longer exist.

7

other media that present harms as well and that with

8

respect -- and that because those other media also

9

present harms, the circumstances require a change in the

10

They're

What they're arguing is that there are

rule with respect to broadcasters.

11

Now, that -- you can I think look at that in

12

one of two ways.

You could say either that's an

13

argument that it's futile to continue to impose this

14

restriction on broadcasters.

15

Fox says at page 33 of its brief.

And I think that's what

16

Two points in response to that.

17

significant, if not complete, answer was in this Court's

18

prior decision in this case in which it said that the

19

maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly

20

important in the context of these changes, a broadcast

21

safe haven.

22

futility in that nature is foreign to our First

23

Amendment jurisprudence.

24
25

I think a

And also I do think that the idea of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Verrilli, I took

it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

the major objection is that one cannot tell what's

2

indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor,

3

that's saying "Private Ryan" is okay, "Schindler's List"

4

is okay, but "NYPD Blue" is not.

5

that is the major objection, that we have a government

6

agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity

7

is okay and when it isn't.

8

time because "New York" -- the "NYPD" was 7 seconds and

9

another broadcast, "Catch-22," was 40 seconds.

10

So, it's -- it's the appearance of

And I do think that

You can't do it in terms of

11

arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in

12

concrete situations.

13

That I think is the major flaw.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Let me turn to that,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

15

first one is that as we read this Court's recent

16

decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on

17

the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is

18

vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered

19

by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here.

20

In other words, was there fair notice with respect to

21

these specific broadcasts?

22

The -- two points about that:

The

And I will get to that, but I -- but let me

23

first go directly to Your Honor's more significant

24

question.

25

at the case that way is that the lens is focused too

And I think the -- the problem with looking

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

narrowly in that there, actually, if you -- one

2

broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of

3

decisions that the commission is making about indecency

4

and then broadens it out even further and looks at the

5

wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number

6

of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even

7

raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is

8

a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction.

9

quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to

It's even

10

broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as

11

indecent or not indecent.

12

And, yes, we would concede that there is not

13

perfect clarity in this rule.

It's a context-based

14

rule.

15

Pacifica that a context-based rule may well be what the

16

Constitution requires here, and that's going to result

17

in some -- something less than absolute precision.

18

the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from

19

my friend's perspective, would be worse.

20

could have a list that said never say the following,

21

however many words; never show broadcasting between the

22

hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of

23

6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.

As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in

But

The commission

24

That would be clearer, but it would -- but,

25

in a way, the commission here, I think by following the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested

2

was required, is being -- I mean, "punished" is too

3

strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's

4

trying to make reasonable accommodations for First

5

Amendment values.

6

And so, I think when one looks at it both in

7

terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused

8

here and the fact that the -- the alternative of perfect

9

clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of

10

First Amendment values, then I do think that the

11

commission's position is quite -- quite reasonable and

12

defensible.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you -- could you

14

digress for one minute to help me understand the

15

procedural posture of this case.

16

time, we were dealing with an issue called "fleeting

17

expletives," and that was Fox.

18

involved just that.

19

or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now

20

at issue.

21

commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground

22

that sets aside the 2001 order.

23

When it was here last

And the Fox case

They didn't really, or we didn't,

And then, without it going back to the

Now, can we here just decide the fleeting

24

expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has

25

to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

and has to do with part 2(2) or something.

2

has -- and how you interpret the words "material dwells

3

on or repeats."

4

get at.

5

I mean, it

Now, that I -- that I understand how to

The ABC case raises -- doesn't raise

6

fleeting expletives.

7

the question of the validity of -- under vagueness

8

grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been

9

applied.

10
11

case.

It wasn't fleeting.

And it raises

But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that

It sent it back to the commission.
So, has there been a commission decision

12

recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being

13

made here about the validity of the 2001 industry

14

guidance as applied?

Has there been such a thing?

15

Alternatively, has there been an appeals

16

court holding on the -- or analysis of the ABC case?

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I do -- I agree with you,

18

Justice Breyer, (a) that this is a complex procedural

19

posture; (b) that the Court would have some discretion

20

in how it approached and resolved the case.

21

With respect to the ABC case, as I read the

22

commission's orders, which are in the appendix to the

23

petition, it applied the 2001 industry guidance to reach

24

the conclusion that the ABC broadcast was indecent.

25

then that was -- that -- then ABC appealed that to the

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

12
1

Second Circuit --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Right.
-- as I understand it,

4

and that the Second Circuit then found that the -- that

5

the commission had violated the Constitution in reaching

6

that result.

7
8

JUSTICE BREYER:

But they didn't -- they

didn't in that case --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE BREYER:

case back.

12

-- and they sent the ABC

I see your -GENERAL VERRILLI:

They did on -- when it

13

came back, Your Honor, they then -- they disposed of the

14

Fox case with a lengthy opinion --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

17

Yes.
-- and then essentially

applied that analysis to the ABC case.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

20
21

I see.
So, I think in

fairness -JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

When this ABC

22

case was argued in front of the commission -- I have

23

here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are

24

filled with very good arguments.

25

made to the commission in the context of the ABC case?

Were those arguments

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought

2

when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox

3

coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all.

4

This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided

5

before.

6

attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives.

7

This is the case of ABC, period.

And it is an

And, therefore, I want to know, at least

8

satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone

9

through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments

10

have all been made in front of the commission and

11

they've been rejected.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, Justice Breyer, I'm

13

not sure that I can vouch for the proposition that the

14

arguments have all been made in front of the

15

commission --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

but has the essence of these arguments.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I'm not saying every one,

In fairness, I do think

19

that -- that if one reads the commission's disposition

20

of the -- the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance

21

reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent

22

under the 2001 guidance.

23

assessed and then, as it has -- as it can do, then

24

invoked the Hobbs Act, went to the court of appeals to

25

challenge it.

ABC paid the fine that it was

And so, I do think -- I do actually think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

that the issues have been considered by the agency and

2

are before the Court.

3

And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I

4

think more directly to the vagueness point, that there

5

really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the

6

fleeting expletives in the -- in the Fox case because

7

the Court said the last time the case was here that

8

there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because

9

there was no forfeiture or any other sanction.

10

ABC is in a different position because they

11

were sanctioned.

12

to the question of whether the commission's indecency

13

standards can constitutionally be applied here and

14

whether they're too vague.

15

I would like to spend a minute on that question of

16

whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC

17

broadcast.

18

And so, there is an issue with respect

But I do think, and I do --

Now, the commission's standards in the 2001

19

guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test.

20

First is a subject matter question:

21

description or depiction of sexual or excretory

22

activities or organs?

23

whether the depiction or description is patently

24

offensive under community standards for broadcast

25

informed by three factors:

Is there a

And then there's a question of

whether the expression is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

explicit, whether the broadcast dwells on it, and

2

whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating.

3

Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to

4

this broadcast that the nudity in the "NYPD Blue"

5

episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria

6

because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would

7

be considered sexual organs for purposes of application

8

of this -- of this standard.

9

The commission said -- and this is at page

10

137a of the appendix to the petition -- that it's

11

impossible to believe that they didn't think that the

12

naked display of buttocks would bring them within --

13

that weren't -- didn't have fair notice that the naked

14

display of buttocks would bring them within this rule.

15

I'm not sure anything more needs to be said about that.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the broader point,

17

General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if

18

you're right that there are many non-vague applications

19

of this commission policy, that there is some amount of

20

uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of

21

uncertainty --

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't --

-- because it turns out that

24

nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as

25

to some body parts, and sometimes it's not allowed; and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

the commission hadn't really said anything about it for

2

50 years; and the length of time doesn't seem to be

3

what's indicative of anything; the kind of body part

4

doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what's indicative

5

of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know.

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

With respect, Justice

7

Kagan, I really disagree with that characterization of

8

the situation.

9

Moving to the second part of the analysis

10

here, I think it's important to take a half a step back.

11

The fact of the matter is -- and I think everybody, all

12

of us, understand this in our experience -- that nudity

13

on broadcast television is an exceedingly, exceedingly,

14

rare thing at any time of the day and certainly between

15

6:00 a.m. and 10 p.m.

16

of us from our experience know that.

17

It is exceedingly rare, and all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the --

Well, I'm not so sure

18

because the examples were given of -- I guess excerpts

19

from "Private Ryan" and from "Schindler's List" have

20

been on television.

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, that's true, Justice

22

Ginsburg.

But, again, I think that's another issue

23

about where the lens is focused.

24

thousands and thousands and thousands of broadcasts, and

25

the Respondents have identified four in which -- over

There have been

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

25 years, in which any nudity has been present.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They have their own

guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they?

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's certainty true,

5

Justice Scalia.

And I do think, in Reno, this Court

6

described the Carlin monologue at issue in Pacifica in

7

the following way:

8

identifiable as indecent because it was a dramatic

9

departure from the customary norms for the broadcast

It said that monologue was readily

10

medium.

11

one just looks at the video here and sees it, I don’t -- I

12

think it's hard to disagree with the proposition that

13

that's a dramatic departure from what's the norm for

14

broadcast television.

15
16
17

I think the kind of nudity -- and I think if

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If they did an excerpt

from "Hair," could they televise that?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think it would raise

18

serious questions.

19

very serious questions, and I think --

20

I think nudity is going to raise

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the -- in the opera,

21

in "The Makropulos Case," there's a scene where a woman

22

is seen nude entering a bathtub.

23

shown, that scene from the opera.

24
25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And suppose that were

Well, I don't -- I think,

Justice Ginsburg, that in a context-based approach,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

there's not going to be perfect clarity.

We recognize

2

that.

3

and that's the question before the Court, whether Fox --

4

excuse me -- whether ABC was on fair notice of whether

5

this broadcast would bring them within the rule.

But I do think with respect to this broadcast --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what you're saying

7

is, is that there is a public value in having a

8

particular segment of the media with different standards

9

than other segments.

And forget radio.

Let's just talk

10

about television.

11

says how much -- how many cable stations there are, and

12

you, what do you call it, surf the -- you go through all

13

the channels.

14

which are broadcast and which are not.

15

But -- you know, in the briefs, it

And it's not apparent to many people

But you're saying that there's still a

16

value, an importance, in having a higher standard or

17

different standard for broadcast media on the

18

television.

19

options, and -- and when it's not apparent to many

20

viewers which of the two they're watching?

21

it's an important symbol for our society that we aspire

22

to a culture that's not vulgar in -- in a very small

23

segment?

24
25

Why is that, when there are so many other

GENERAL VERRILLI:
that, Justice Kennedy:

Just because

Two points in response to

2

providing an answer, that yes, it does make a difference

to preserve a safe haven where, if parents want to put

4

their kids down in front of the television set at

5

8:00 p.m., they know that there's a segment of what's

6

available that -- where they're not going to have to

7

worry about whether the kids are going to get bombarded

8

with curse words or nudity.

9

And then the reason --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -But this goes -But then there's -- and

12

then there's -- and then there's the chip that's

13

available.

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.
And, of course, you ask

16

your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off

17

the chip.

They're the only ones that know how to do it.

18

(Laughter. )

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, and that -- that

20

does point out the problem with the -- with the V-chip.

21

Of course, the V-chip is not new.

22

more than a decade, and the -- the broadcasters have

23

tried to encourage uptake.

24

encourage uptake.

25

It's been around for

The government has tried to

It hasn't taken.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But is your point is -- is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

that the chip technology works better if you have this

2

differentiation between broadcast and cable media?

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, a different point.

I

4

think the -- I want to get to what I think is the

5

fundamental point here, that whatever may be the case

6

with respect to the ability of a viewer to differentiate

7

whether something is a broadcast channel or a cable

8

channel, the reality is that broadcasters are in a

9

different position by virtue of the fact that they have

10

a license from the government that comes with this

11

enforceable public obligation that allows the government

12

to create this safe haven, and that puts them in a

13

different position.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

circular.

16

asking --

That's what we're here to argue about.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Well, in a way, that's
I'm

Right.
-- is there a functional,

a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two?

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Is there -- well, I'm

21

sorry, Justice Kennedy.

The V-chip works with both

22

broadcast and -- and cable transmissions, to the extent

23

it works.

24

and I would suggest in particular that the Court look at

25

the brief from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which

The -- what the briefs have pointed out --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

does a very thorough job in explaining the many ways in

2

which the V-chip has proven to be a deficient

3

technology.

4

incompleteness of the codes, the labels that -- that the

5

programmers put in to begin with, which have to be there

6

in order for the V-chip to decide what gets through and

7

what doesn't.

8
9

A lot of it goes to the inaccuracy and

And I would point out in this very case, for
example, with respect to the -- for example, the 2003

10

Billboard Music Award broadcast with the Paris Hilton-

11

Nicole Richie back and forth, one would never have known

12

from the code affixed for the V-chip purpose that that

13

broadcast was going to have those kinds of words in

14

them.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

What will happen when --

16

when we get to the point where -- when there are only a

17

handful of people in the entire country who are still

18

receiving television programs via the airwaves?

19
20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

not there now, as we've said in our brief, but --

21
22
23

Well, I do think we're

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We're almost there, right --

10 percent?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

And I do -- but that I

24

think -- that really makes what I think is one of the

25

most fundamental points here, is that the broadcasters

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

want to have it both ways, right?

2

licenses they have are worth billions and billions of

3

dollars.

4

and -- and they're sitting on an enormously valuable

5

resource which they got for free, and then they have a

6

statutory benefit of must-carry, which gets them on

7

cable systems automatically, and a further statutory

8

benefit of preferred channel placement on -- on those --

9

They -- the spectrum

Spectrum is staggeringly, staggeringly scarce,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sign -- sign me up as

10

supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a

11

symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of

12

dress for the people that attend this Court and the

13

people that attend other Federal courts.

14

symbolic matter.

15

It's a

And if this is – if these are public airwaves,

the government is entitled to insist upon a certain

17

modicum of decency.

18

to juveniles, to tell you the truth.

19

I'm not sure it even has to relate

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And -- and we certainly

20

agree, Justice Scalia, with the point that was made in

21

the Court's previous decision in this case, that -- for

22

example, the words that are in the Fox broadcasts --

23

teachers don't use those words with students.

24

hear those words in churches or synagogues.

that the standard can still be symbolic, as

13

Justice Scalia said.

14

the very children we're talking about, when they go on

15

the street, when they -- their big brother says

16

something to them, it is -- the words that were -- the

17

expletives are in common parlance today.

18

is -- I think that children -- that children are not

19

going to be shocked by them the way they might have been

20

a generation ago.

21

We want the King's English when --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I mean, it

Justice Ginsburg, I think

22

something this Court said in its prior decision is -- is

23

right on the mark with respect to this issue, which is

24

it's a question of whether it's portrayed as

25

appropriate.

And when it is -- it's one thing when your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

13-year-old brother is saying it to you or some bully in

2

the schoolyard is saying it to you.

3

It's another when it's presented to you in

4

this medium as an appropriate means of communication.

5

That's true with respect to words, and it's also true

6

with respect to nudity.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

11

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS FOX TELEVISION

12

STATIONS, INC., ET AL.

13
14
15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I'd like to respond initially to some of

16

General Verrilli's general observations.

17

he talks about indecency as somehow serving as the core

18

of the overall understanding of the regulatory deal that

19

was made here.

20

notion when there was no effort whatsoever to enforce

21

the -- the standard of indecency between 1927 and 1975.

22

First of all,

And it's difficult for me to accept that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's because

23

broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these

24

sorts of words or these sorts of images.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, maybe, maybe not.

Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official

25
1

don't know.

All we know is that for a period of

2

50 years, nothing happened.

So, the idea --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no, we know.

Yes, that's right.
I mean, we can -- it

6

was not the case from 1927 till whenever you -- what,

7

1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on

8

broadcast television or the various words we're dealing

9

with here commonly appeared.

So, it seems a bit much to

10

say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period.

11

There were no cases to be brought.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

The only point I'm trying to

13

make, Chief Justice, is that if you're talking about

14

this as sort of the core understanding between the

15

parties, it simply played a fairly minor role in the

16

process through the bulk of the regulatory period we're

17

talking about.

18

this is a statute that prohibits obscenity, profanity,

19

and indecency.

20

writing about profanity as somehow being offended by

21

what went on in this omnibus order, the commission has

22

completely abandoned that under these circumstances.

23

And, indeed, if you put it in context,

And while the FCC spent a lot of time

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But how about this,

24

Mr. Phillips:

Look, you've been given a privilege, and

25

that gives the government at least somewhat more leeway

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

to impose obligations on you.

2

everything, but at least has a bit more leeway.

3

here we've had something that's very historically

4

grounded.

5

the broadcast is -- the broadcaster is treated

6

differently.

7

Not -- can't impose
And

We've had this for decades and decades that

It seems to work, and it -- it seems to be a

8

good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the

9

old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist

10

anymore.

11

So, why not just keep it as it is?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, first of all, Justice

13

Kagan, it was important to catch the answer to your

14

question when you asked it of General Verrilli, which

15

was you're not saying that we lose all of our First

16

Amendment rights.

17

Amendment rights.

18

So, clearly we retain our First

And, under those circumstances, it seems to

19

me you've got this two ways:

First of all, the idea

20

that it, quote, "worked" -- it worked perfectly fine

21

from all the way up until 2001, even I would say until

22

2004, when the commission wildly changed its approach.

23

And it's only become dysfunctional since 2004 and, as we

24

sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands

25

of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so

2

that the whole system has come to a screeching halt

3

because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these

4

issues.

5

So, to say that the system is working well,

6

it seems to me, at least from the broadcasters'

7

perspective, is to say -- is to suggest that's just not

8

true.

9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

overrule a decision of this Court, Pacifica.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

Well, you want us to

Yes, Justice Alito.
Now, as to radio, what --

what has changed?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm not here -To justify that?

Well,

16

could we hold that the policy is -- is invalid as to --

17

on First Amendment grounds as to TV but not as to radio?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Absolutely, Your Honor,

19

because there are fundamentally different media, and

20

there are different protections and the circumstances

21

are different, and the Court has recognized that media

22

have to be evaluated individually.

23

happened over the 30 years with respect to the broadcast

24

side of television is a very fundamental change.

25

is now equally pervasive.

But what has

Cable is now equally

Alderson Reporting Company

Cable

Official

28
1

accessible to TV, satellite equally accessible to TV.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that -- but that

3

-- that cuts both ways.

People who want to watch

4

broadcasts where these words or expose their children to

5

broadcasts where these words are used, where there is

6

nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for

7

that.

8

asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not

9

going to -- they're not going to hear the "S" word, the

All we're asking for, what the Government is

10

"F" word.

11

proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts

12

against you.

13

They're not going to see nudity.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So, the

Well, it seems to me there

14

are two answers to that:

15

one medium operates in a certain way in the exercise of

16

its First Amendment rights can be used as an -- as an

17

explanation for taking away or for -- for restricting

18

the First Amendment rights of another medium is flatly

19

inconsistent with what this Court has said across the

20

board in the First Amendment context.

21

off one speaker against another and give one favored

22

status and give another unfavored status.

23

First of all, the notion that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't balance

Well, that's your

24

argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective

25

to have a safe harbor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, you can get a safe

2

harbor, and, indeed, there are a number of safe harbors

3

that are out there.

4

cable networks that are aimed exclusively at children.

5

And, you know, there are five, six, eight stations that,

6

I guarantee you, you will see -- where you'll see none

7

of that language.

8
9

First of all, there are a ton of

And, second of all, it's always available to
the United States Government to decide to hold this --

10

to create its own license for the United States to be a

11

broadcaster and to ensure that the broadcasts of the

12

United States public network exclude anything they want

13

to exclude because that's government speech and is in no

14

way restricted by what the First Amendment would

15

provide.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we rule in your

17

favor on the First Amendment grounds, what will people

18

who watch Fox be seeing between 6:00 a.m. and

19

10:00 p.m.?

20

parading around in the nude and a stream of expletives?

21

Are they going to be seeing a lot of people

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not under the guidelines that

22

the -- that Fox has used consistently from 10:00 p.m.

23

until 6:00 a.m. and candidly that all of the other

24

networks follow.

25

The truth is the advertisers and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

audiences that have to be responded to by the networks

2

insist on some measure of restraint, not a measure

3

of restraint --

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, what will you put on

that you are not able to put on now?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, some of the

7

things that we could at least wonder about is "Saving

8

Private Ryan," "Catch-22," perhaps the beginning of the

9

Olympics.

There's a whole slew of questions.

I mean,

10

the -- and if you go beyond that and you think about

11

what speech has been chilled, the Tillman memorial

12

service is not broadcast because of fear of what's going

13

to be said there.

14

local news events --

15

Football games, basketball games,

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, suppose we

16

take that particular line.

17

Fox didn't argue -- Fox was worried about the fleeting

18

expletive policy in Golden Globe.

19

Globe, when it was before the commission, they raised

20

all these vagueness challenges to the whole 2001 policy.

21

You didn't argue -- I mean,

I doubt in Golden

So, why -- here you've taken a much broader

22

stance now, though you didn't before.

I mean, do you

23

want to say anything about what I think is the basic

24

issue that Fox raises?

25

Pacifica.

We don't have to overrule

What Fox was penalized for was two women on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

television who basically used a fleeting expletive which

2

seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and we're worried

5

about small stations that cannot censor people because

6

they don't know what they're going to say.

7

That was what we wrote, I think in -- in my opinion,

8

anyway.

We were worried about that.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10
11

All right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Are you abandoning that

argument?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, no, no, of course not.

13

But you have to realize, Justice Breyer, that what -- I

14

mean, the Second Circuit, because it didn't have

15

available to it sort of what to do precisely with

16

Pacifica, tended to focus on the question of vagueness.

17

Vagueness was certainly an argument that we made there,

18

but --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's an ABC argument

20

primarily, but you made that argument in the Second

21

Circuit.

22

comment more, but -- is, do we have to reach that

23

argument?

What I'm fishing with -- you don't have to

Except it's --

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No --- very, very broad --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

It's absolutely clear to

2

me that if this Court wants to say no more than we

3

decided the outer limits of the First Amendment in

4

Pacifica --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.
-- and it goes to the verbal

7

shock treatment that Justice Powell described in a

8

separate opinion, and this doesn't come anywhere near

9

that, and, therefore, this is beyond what the First

10

Amendment provides, the Court could clearly hold that

11

way and rule --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's not really

13

clear.

14

should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of

15

the "F" word, the "S" word, any -- any shots of any

16

nudity in any movie, buttocks included.

17

you all of the notice that you need.

18

propose that?

19

I mean, if you want us to be really clear, you

That would give

Why don't you

Boy, that's certain as can be.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, our basic argument

20

would then -- I mean, obviously what you'd be taking

21

away is the vagueness argument, but that would just

22

bring you back then, Justice Scalia, to the core

23

Pacifica argument and the question of how far can the --

24

how is it permissible to allow the FCC to regulate the

25

broadcast networks on standards that are fundamentally

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

different than cable, the Internet, and every other

2

medium that exists?

3

happy if they want to try to adopt those kinds of

4

standards and subject them to the strict scrutiny

5

requirements that this Court applies to every other

6

medium, because the truth is those requirements will not

7

withstand scrutiny under those particular standards.

8
9

I -- you know, I'd be perfectly

JUSTICE ALITO:
living on borrowed time.

Well, broadcast TV is -- is

It's not going to be long

10

before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track

11

tapes.

12
13

MR. PHILLIPS:

I hope that -- I'm sure my

client is not thrilled to hear you say that.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, no, I'm sure.

I'm sure your clients will

17

continue to make billions of dollars on their programs

18

which are -- which are transmitted by cable and by

19

satellite and by Internet.

20

that they're making money from people who are using

21

rabbit ears, that's -- that's disappearing.

22

disagree with that?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the -- to the extent

Do you

No, I -- it would be -- you

24

know, obviously not, because that's why we're not

25

uniquely accessible or uniquely pervasive.

10

Well, because -- well, we

JUSTICE ALITO:

The FCC is the

Well, you're asking us to

intervene by overruling a prior precedent.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'd be -- well, I think

11

once the issue is before the Court, it ought to decide

12

the First Amendment question that's presented here, and

13

the First Amendment question says what can the FCC do

14

under these circumstances?

15

It seems to me there are probably four

16

different ways you can go about it, all of which says

17

what the FCC did here is wrong.

You can say Pacifica is

18

an exceedingly narrow decision.

It goes to the outer

19

limits of what the First Amendment allows the FCC to do.

What they've done here is unconstitutional --

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that they will use it,

7

perhaps.

But that doesn't mean that we wouldn't

9

we have our own standards.

13

incentive for these vulgar comments.

16

set it up that way.

20

But, remember, the first -- the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, I mean, isn't it

inevitable that this will happen?
MR. PHILLIPS:

It is inevitable that --

21

well, I think it's inevitable regardless that people are

22

going to continue to use language that they would

23

naturally use.

24

cable and any other forum in which you have humans

25

speaking that this kind of language will expand.

So, yes, I do think you can expect on

be the case that in some context, particularly live

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, in some -- I

think it probably depends on which -- which channels you

5

-- you look at, and even in the basic channels, but the

6

-- there's the cartoon that's significantly more adult

7

that's on the cable channels than the cartoons that you

8

might see on the -- on the Fox Television.

9

So, yes, I think there's probably a certain

10

edgierness to it, but that said, it's still clear

11

that -- that as long as you have advertising revenue

12

that drives a significant amount of the decisionmaking

13

here, you're going to have the kind of self-restraint

14

that frankly ought to cause the Court to say we should

15

no -- we no longer need to treat the broadcast medium as

16

the weak sister of -- of the media.

17

And, therefore, they ought to have the same

engage in the same restrained approach to these kinds of

issues that newspapers do.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ABC, INC., ET AL.
MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When the issue is the content-based

16

regulation of speech, it is the government, not the

17

speaker, that must steer, quote, "far wide of the

18

prohibited zone."

19

nowhere in evidence in the FCC's current enforcement

20

regime, which not only intrudes into the prohibited zone

21

but also enforces the indecency ban in a starkly

22

inconsistent manner.

That foundational principle is

23

A regime in which government officials

24

decide years after the fact that 7 seconds of rear

25

nudity in this particular episode of "NYPD Blue" is

indecent, but 40 seconds of nudity including full

2

frontal nudity in "Catch-22" is not; that expletives in

4

even more of those expletives in a fictional movie about

Because you wanted to make

more money from it, I understand that.

And maybe people

8

would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the

9

inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at

10

this show is not like "Private Ryan."

It's about sexual

11

awakening.

12

The viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of

13

the boy who's seeing her, and the whole thing was

14

titillating.

15

They are showing a part of a nude woman.

Now, they might be wrong.

There are two

sides to that argument.

arguing is -- if I were to say, is that a reasonable

view?

them in its decision in the ABC case.

20

First of all, the -- the -- both First

We, of course, didn't ask the -- suggest

21

to the commission that it should no longer apply

23

scrutiny didn't apply, as we didn't in the Second

Circuit, because only this Court can reconsider the

25

application of that standard.

we're making here.
That argument is not necessary to resolving

clearly this was a shot out of the blue.

With respect to

The commission cannot identify -- I

10

challenge the commission to identify a single decision

11

of the commission issued before this was broadcast in

you pointed out yourself, to look at what the commission

has been addressing.

They're right now -- I mean, you know, I've

5

cited the ones that are the subject of commission

decisions.

to hypothesize about all the other instances, but let's

just look at what's at stake here because the issue,

9

Justice Breyer, is not just notice to ABC in this case.

I haven't cited the -- I haven't attempted

10

The question is whether the standards -- the

11

commission's standards as it's currently applying them

12

are so vague and capacious that they not only permit

13

arbitrary action, but they are engaging in arbitrary

14

action.

15

Right now, as -- as Mr. Phillips suggested,

16

the commission has pending before it, which it has not

17

denied for years, complaints about the opening episode

18

of the last Olympics, which included a -- a statue very

much like some of the statues that are here in this

approaches it could take to reduce the astonishing

vagueness of the current --

10

the alternatives to the present system that don't jump

obscenity alone?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't know the pages.

15

just -- I can't remember the pages.

16

what I think -- four different things that could

17

ameliorate the vagueness of the current regime.

Let me

Let me just outline

18

First of all, the FCC could revert back to

19

it's, quote, "emphatically narrow enforcement regime,"

20

which acknowledged, one, that it had to defer to

21

reasonable judgments of the broadcasters, and not

22

exercise the -- an editorial eye looking at camera

23

angles, whether something was or wasn't necessary to the

24

message.

25

Number two -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I'm going to

Official

51
1

let you get all four out.

But on that, the reasonable

2

deference to the broadcasters, your policy was not to

3

allow people in the situation of Paris Hilton and Nicole

4

Richie to use those words.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, if they deferred

7

to your reasonable judgment, your friend's reasonable

8

judgment, they would sanction those.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not owning Nicole Richie,

10

and I think the best answer to the Nicole Richie point

11

is that there is a scienter requirement in the statute

12

that, you know, would preclude the application to a

13

good-faith effort.

14
15

But let me just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. WAXMAN:

17

there are three parts to number one.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. WAXMAN:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23
24
25

Go on to

number two.

16

21

Okay.

I'll just go back.

Well, no --

I'm not -- I'm not being -Your time's -- I

think you are.
Your time is about to expire.

If you want

to get your four points out, you'd better move.
MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

The first one is to

revert back to the prior enforcement regime that existed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

before 2004, which deferred to reasonable judgments, was

2

restricted to material that is not momentary exposure

3

but is dwelled upon, and that, as Pacifica explained,

4

was egregious material akin to depictions of erotic

5

activity.

6

The second thing they could do is make this

7

three-factor test -- or however many factors it is -- a

8

test, not just a nonexclusive list of an infinite number

9

of factors that could or couldn't be balanced in any way

10

the commission wants to.

11

Even if it wants to leave it as factors --

12

and this is number three -- it could at least identify

13

what they are and apply them consistency -- consistently

14

through adjudication that explains why one over-balances

15

the other, which it certainly did not do in this case.

16

And it also could clean up the actual form

17

of the words that it uses, referring, for example, to

18

sexually explicit or excretory activity.

the idea that there's a significant First Amendment

13

problem that encompasses a wide variety of broadcast

14

expression I just don't think comports with the facts.

15

So,

Second, I do think if one looks at the

16

corpus of decisions that the commission has made about

17

what's indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with

18

respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority

19

of them, that it's clear which side of the line

20

something fell on.

21

There are going to be some hard cases.

22

have identified what is, in the great scheme of things,

23

a trivial number of hard cases.

24
25

Yes, there isn't perfect clarity.
But they really

I don't think one can say that this is a
situation like Reno in which there's effectively no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

standard at all.

2

Pacifica situation eight ways to Sunday, and I think

3

we've identified them in our brief and those are valid.

4

In Reno, this Court distinguished the

I do think there's a significant problem

5

with thinking about Pacifica as the outer bound of the

6

commission's authority under the First Amendment.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Of course --

Even though the Justices

8

involved said this is a narrow decision, both Justice

9

Stevens and Justice Powell.

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, and, Justice

11

Ginsburg, that's true, and the principles the commission

12

continues to apply are narrow principles.

13

not -- this is not something that covers a vast array of

14

speech on broadcast.

15

and I do think if you're talking about Pacifica as the

16

outer bound, the consequences are the shock jocks are

17

fine; the Super Bowl half-time episode with Janet

18

Jackson is fine.

19

It's a tiny fraction.

This is

And so --

You can have as many of these 7-second

20

episodes of "NYPD Blue" as you want.

21

In fact, anything that's -- anything that isn't at

22

that extreme level is fine.

23
24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's all fine.

And on the other side,

you'd better be careful about calling certain people,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

certain artists to be interviewed because, even though

2

it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to

3

say something they shouldn't say.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But I -- a couple answers

5

there.

One is the delaying bleeping technology, Justice

6

Ginsburg, and the other one is that there is a scienter

7

requirement under the commission's enforcement authority

8

here.

9

unlikely you would have the requisite scienter that

And so, in that situation, it seems highly

10

could lead to a forfeiture.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Maybe the third is you

shouldn't interview these people.

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Let me spend, if I could,

14

a minute on the "NYPD Blue" broadcast.

15

hinges a lot on the notion, Justice Breyer, that this is

16

a non-sexualized episode.

17

make up one's own mind looking at the video.

18

commission decided that that was -- it was essentially

19

voyeurism.

20
21
22

The -- ABC

I mean, I guess one could
The

The -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Finish your

sentence, please.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you.

The little

23

boy walks into the room at the very end of that -- of

24

that segment of nudity, and I do think that fully

25

vindicates the commission's judgment with respect to the

nature of that broadcast.

Thank you.
