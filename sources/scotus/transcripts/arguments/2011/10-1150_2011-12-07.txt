ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

We're here today to urge the Court to

12

reinstate the district court's decision, which

13

faithfully applied this Court's precedents under section

14

101 of the Patent Act.

15

patent is its broad pre-emption of a physical

16

phenomenon, which prevents others like Mayo Clinic from

17

offering a better metabolite test with more accurate

18

numbers.

19

The problem with the Prometheus

And this is a huge practical problem for

20

patients.

21

Too much of this can be fatal; too little can leave a

22

chronic lingering disease in the patient.

23

These thiopurine drugs are strong medicine.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I didn't

24

think that this patent covered the actual machine.

25

is free to develop a new machine.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, it -- what it can't do

2

is use any number from 400 up until infinity, and it

3

believes that's the wrong number.

4

-- a different standard for a legion of autoimmune

5

diseases, and there are dozens and dozens of them.

6

That's a broad field to pre-empt the natural phenomenon.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

is much narrower than that.

9

ranges actually.

And it can't have a

Well, it -- it actually

It's within a range, two

And so, it has already changed one

10

range, and that's not the subject of the district

11

court's finding that the lower number it's proposing is

12

infringing.

13

So, it's not as broad as you are stating.

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, you -- you see, Your

15

Honor, we believe the correct number is 450 to 700.

16

that's necessary to cure various autoimmune diseases.

17

And Prometheus took the position that its patent

18

pre-empts everything above 400, all the way up to

19

infinity, it said, for all autoimmune diseases, dozens

20

and dozens of them.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it took that

22

position, but the district court narrowed it to 15

23

percent, to 15 --

24
25

MR. SHAPIRO:
didn't, Your Honor.

And

Well, you know, actually it

You'll see in that opinion, there

Alderson Reporting Company

are two rulings.

2

lowers the number; but it said 400 and above all the way

3

to infinity.

4

One is the 15 percent ruling, which

There's no upper limit on this.
So, as a practical matter, there's no room

5

for anybody else to offer a metabolite test.

6

this means for patients is one opinion in the United

7

States.

If you have one of these life-threatening

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And what

It can offer the test.

-- you get one opinion.

It can offer the test.

It just can't recommend the dosage to the doctor.

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, it can't have a test

15

that has a different therapeutic range, because that's a

16

pre-emption.

17
18

They take the position -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They measure something --

a different issue.

24
25

Tests do two things:

Yes.
-- and therapeutic range

The tests can happen.

The doctor

What the doctor does with that number is

MR. SHAPIRO:

And -- and what -- what

Prometheus submitted and the court agreed is if you are

Alderson Reporting Company

6
1

notified, if you are aware of their range when you're

2

drawing blood, that's an infringement right then and

3

there, if -- if you're aware or warned by their number.

4

So, any doctor in the United States that

5

draws blood and is aware of this range of theirs is

6

pre-empting.

7

been able to offer this competing test now for 7 years.

8
9

And the practical result is we haven't

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When -- when the

Respondent addresses this, will they take issue with the

10

way you describe what has been pre-empted, or as you

11

read their -- we'll ask them -- but as you read their

12

brief, is this crystal-clear?

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, you'll see,

14

Justice Kennedy, in the district court, they argued for

15

any number above 400.

16

what it says.

17

18

position.

That's -- it's 400 and above, is

And they said there's no upper limit on

The district court found that.

That was their

19

It was accepted.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In thinking about what's

20

pre-empted, I looked at the Diehr case involving the

21

rubber molding --

22

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- and the constant

24

monitoring.

And if you could take an analogy from that,

25

let's -- let's suppose that there was a system of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

measurements that you take every half-hour which

2

constantly monitor how a drug is being retained in the

3

tissues, and that there is a protocol for the admission

4

of some two or three different drugs to get the balance

5

right.

In other words, it's much more complicated.

6

Is there some point at which that is

7

patentable, even though this pre-empts a -- a whole

8

range of different choices?

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

10

Well, it may be patentable.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's hard for you to

11

answer -- you know, there's a million hypotheticals.

12

But I'm just trying to --

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

The key is the specificity.
-- see what the process is

here.

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

If it leaves room for others

17

to have their own tests with different numbers and

18

different procedures so that it isn't just one test for

19

the whole country, then yes, if it's specific enough.

20

The specificity is the key.

21

What -- what the Court said in Bilski, of

22

course, is that you can't pre-empt a whole field, a

23

broad field with -- with your -- your patent, which this

24

one does.

25

covered --

And if you look at the diseases that are

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

with that.

3

is?

I -- I'm not comfortable

4

I mean, it depends on how -- how broad it

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

If you -- if you

5

pre-empt all the numbers up to infinity and all

6

autoimmune diseases, that's a vast field.

7

bigger than the field in Flook.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about up to 700?

MR. SHAPIRO:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, no.

I -- I think --

No.

550?
I -- I think -830?

No.
I mean, how are we supposed

to apply that kind of a rule?

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think doctors have to

18

have freedom to make their own judgments about these

19

natural phenomena.

20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:
830?

MR. SHAPIRO:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Above -- above 830 or below

Which?

22

24

Is

that okay?

10

16

It's much

Well, I -- no.

I think --

It just seems to me not

a -- not a patent rule that we could possibly apply.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, it's the rule I believe

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

adopted in Bilski and in Flook, that you can't wipe out

2

a whole field so no one else can have a competing test.

3

The result for the public is that these numbers would be

4

frozen for 20 years, and a very serious person couldn't

5

get a second opinion from Mayo Clinic, which uses

6

different numbers.

7

That's why we think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't -- doesn't any --

8

any medical patent rely on natural processes?

9

even if you invent a new drug, what that new drug does

10

is -- is natural.

11

physiognomy --

It affects the -- the human

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Oh, yes.

MR. SHAPIRO:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, yes.
Is it -- is it therefore

precluded from patentability?

18
19

-- in a certain natural

way.

15

17

I mean,

MR. SHAPIRO:

No, it's not.

And, in fact,

this drug was patented.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

What's different here?

The difference is the

22

specificity.

If you invent a drug which has a

23

particular chemical formula, others can invent other

24

drugs.

There's room for competing drugs in the medical

25

world.

And you'll -- many, many patented drugs --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought your answer to

But you're giving a

I mean, that's how I would
But that's obviously not --

No, I --- the right way to do it.

I think that's -- that's

one -- one part of it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's another one of

17

your arguments, but one of your arguments says you can't

18

patent nature.

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

You can't patent nature.
Right.

That's correct.
And that relates to the

question that I asked.

24

MR. SHAPIRO:

But --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And tell me why you can't

Alderson Reporting Company

11

patent nature, then?

2

MR. SHAPIRO:

Because -- because of the law

of nature doctrine that has existed for 150 years in

4

this Court.

Pieces of nature can't be monopolized.

formulas.

Congress has never disagreed with that.

Pardon me?
Nature always has a

reaction to the drug.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

So, all doctors --

15

that's part of the storehouse of information.

16

doctors can look at that reaction.

17

400 is the wrong number.

Now, it's very important for patients to

24

be -- with life-threatening conditions, to be able to

25

get that information.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But then, how

2

do you -- that's -- I see that.

3

reasons why I think the law of nature doctrine exists,

4

because they are not relevant to my question.

5
6

My question is I think it's hornbook law
that the law of nature cannot be patented.

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I will spare you the

Yes.
It is also hornbook law

that the application of a law of nature can be patented.

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Right.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, in this

12

case, what I think the claim is, is that we are applying

13

a law of nature.

14

Administer a drug, determine the level.

15

uses the word "wherein," which I'll ask them what that

16

means.

17

administer the drug, determine the level, are the

18

application of the law of nature that they found.
Now, there's something odd about that in
your view --

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

And then it

But -- but -- so, they say those two words,

19
20

Now, we read the words of applying it:

Yes.
-- at least.

And I want to

know what.
MR. SHAPIRO:

For us, the real oddity is

that this numerical calibration that they've given

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

extends up to infinity, and it precludes every other

2

blood test.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Suppose it

4

didn't.

5

someone takes aspirin, I discover they have to take

6

aspirin for a headache, and, you know, I see an amazing

7

thing:

8

notice the color, it shows the aspirin, you need a

9

little more; unless it's a different color, you need a

10

Suppose I discover that if I take aspirin,

If you look at a person's little finger, and you

little less.

Now, I've discovered a law of nature --

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and I may have spent

13

millions on that.

And I can't patent that law of

14

nature, but I say I didn't; I said apply it.

15

look at his little finger.

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Sure.

MR. SHAPIRO:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

23
24
25

Okay?

Is that a good

patent or isn't it?

19

22

I said

No, it's -- it's not.
Why not?

It's not a good patent

because -JUSTICE BREYER:

If you can tell me why not,

I'll have an understanding of where you're coming from.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, because you've -- you've

2

observation of the man's little finger.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

problem.

5

to add.

Ah.

Now, we're into the

And that is the problem of how much you have

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you look at the Court's

8

cases, they seem to say Flook, one thing, and Diehr,

9

another thing.

10

And so, what is your view about how much has

11

to be added to make it an application of a law of

12

nature?

And how would you put that in words?

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

There are several things that

14

it can't be.

15

said in Flook, a conventional step isn't sufficient,

16

because that's just adding a law of nature to prior art,

17

and prior art plus prior art equals nothing that is

18

patentable under the Flook decision.

19
20
21

After Bilski, which reaffirmed what was

And also, the step that you add has to
narrow your pre-emption -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Does that

22

render it nonpatentable because it's not novel?

23

the reason why it -- it renders it nonpatentable?

24

MR. SHAPIRO:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that

Well -That's not what we're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

talking about here; we're not talking about novelty, are

2

we?

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

No, we're really not.

What

4

the Court -- what the Court said in Bilski is that a

5

conventional step plus a law of nature isn't sufficient,

6

and what the Court explained in Flook is that the law of

7

nature is part of the common domain; it's part of prior

8

art.

9

nothing under section 101.

So, if you're adding prior art to prior art, it's

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shapiro, on that

11

question and the question Justice Scalia just raised,

12

the Government, you know, has taken the position that

13

you're under the wrong section.

14

patentability, but you've used the example of the

15

finger; you said it's obvious.

16

the sections that the Government says would have been

17

the appropriate ones on the novelty or anticipation of

18

prior art and obviousness?

MR. SHAPIRO:

It's not a question of

20

question for the medical community.

24

it's a law of nature.

2

medical researchers need to have access to --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's hard to resist the

4

temptation to peek into the obvious component or the

5

nonobvious component and then go back and apply it to

6

101.

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

ourselves to talk just about 101 in this.

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.
You want us to discipline

Well, no, I think -- we have

11

two arguments on this point.

12

and Bilski peeked, and -- and they looked at the

13

conventional nature of the additional step, and

14

that's --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The first is both Flook

But once you say

16

"conventional nature," you're saying it's not novel.

17

If -- if the step is not conventional, it's okay.

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

Why?

Well -Because it's novel.

This -- this is the Court's

21

101 analysis in both Flook and in Bilski.

So, we rely

22

on the latest decision, Bilski, which took exactly that

23

peek.

pre-emption of the natural phenomenon, if it's just an

But the other part of our answer is you don't
If the step doesn't narrow the

incidental step that you need to use to observe the

2

natural phenomenon, which this blood test is, you can't

see the natural phenomenon.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

You are getting warmer,

but --

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the -- the words, look,

8

"a simple conventional step."

9

it's true in this case or not, discovering natural laws

Hmmm.

You see, whether

is often a very expensive process.

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there's lots of

Oh, sure.
But they can't, okay?

So,

16

now you're going to say, well, what do they have to add

17

to that?

18

have to just not look at the law of nature, don't look

19

at it when you decide whether it's novel, that not only

20

runs into conflict with prior cases, but it doesn't make

21

much sense because really the novel thing is often the

22

law of nature.

And now we run into problems, because if you

6

reasons.

7
8

And it can't be that you take the law

It's -- it's pretty clear in the

But, look, what do you want to say the rest
of it has to add up to?

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

In our view, the rest of it

10

has to add up to some step that limits the natural

11

phenomenon, so that you have a concrete, specific --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're going on a

13

limitation thing.

14

the 15 fancy hypotheticals I'll also spare you.

So, you're going to say reject all

Well, in the Diehr -- in the

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the Diehr case -Which unfortunately we have

to deal with.
MR. SHAPIRO:

In the Diehr case, the natural

But that is an issue under sections 102 and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shapiro just told us,

6

when I asked him that question based on your -- your

7

brief, that people need to know up front that it's --

8

this is not a patentable subject matter; very important

9

that it be 101 and not 102 and 103.

So, how do you

10

answer his rejection of the adequacy of prior --

11

anticipating prior art or obviousness?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think the answer,

13

Justice Ginsburg, is that from the perspective of the

14

United States and the PTO, it's exactly the opposite;

15

that importing these -- taking -- as Justice Kennedy

16

suggested, taking up the temptation to import a look

17

into novelty and nonobviousness into the 101 inquiry is

18

going to be very destabilizing; that 101, as Bilski

19

said, is a threshold eligibility test, and the question

20

is whether there is a process.

21

Here there is a process.

It's the

22

administration of a drug that changes the body

23

chemistry, and there's then a test to determine the

extent of the change, and then there's an inference at

long to see if this is something they can -- can do?

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

As a practical matter, at

6

the PTO, Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't make any

7

difference, because the PTO examiner gets a patent

8

application and answers every question, 101, 102, 103,

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Not -- not if one moves

16

the novelty and the obviousness inquiries from 102 and

25

Alderson Reporting Company

And I do think it's important to think about

2

it in terms of the points Mr. Shapiro is making.

3

this patent had involved -- instead of standard old

4

blood tests, had involved a breakthrough new test that

5

allowed one to measure metabolite levels in a way that

6

could never have been done before, of course the person

7

who invented that could get this patent, even though it

8

would have the excluding effect that Mr. Shapiro has

9

identified.

10

If

Similarly, if the drug is a breakthrough

11

drug and a patentable drug, any use of the drug during

12

its patented period, including a use in a test like

13

this, would be an infringement under 271.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about the --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask you about your -Justice Scalia.

What about the discovery of

18

a new physical change in the body caused by an old drug?

19

You -- you find that it affects another part of the

20

human system.

21

Is it -- is that discovery patentable?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think that's a

22

harder question, but there are, for example -- and I

23

think the Court was looking at some of this in the

24

Caraco case on Monday -- these follow-on patents with

25

respect to pharmaceutical products, where you patent it

2

when you discover a different use.

3

there's an entire regulatory system set up to deal with

4

that.

5

that can be patentable, yes.

And, in fact,

So, I do think there are circumstances in which

6

13

a human pollutant that's present in the atmosphere, in

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The existence of a

17

pollutant in the air and its effect probably is a

18

natural phenomenon, but the difference here is that

19

there's a conversion of the natural body chemistry.

20

metabolites wouldn't be in the body but for the

administration of these drugs.

400, and about 230 plus or minus 230.

23

5

6

violated it because 450 is greater than 400.

It didn't look
But

And it also said it

7

At the court of appeals, we argued that the

8

right way to read the district court's opinion was that

9

you had to actually do that comparison, that the ranges,

10

the 15 percents, mattered and that the doctor, in order

11

to infringe, would have to look at the result and say is

12

this or isn't this greater than 400, and compare it to

13

400, or 230.

14

The court of appeals accepted that reading

15

of it, and that reading wasn't disputed by Mayo and, on

16

page 3a of the court of appeals' opinion, the court of

17

appeals says has to be compared to a predetermined

18

number.

19

I think you could go either way on this.

I

20

think, frankly, the Court could go back to the district

court and look at that, perhaps.

22

that is that there was no objection at the court of

23

appeals.

problem with the broad ranges here, in other words if

there is a problem with the fact that we're saying over

problem.

5

the Court certainly can't presume we're wrong in that.

6

So, let's suppose that we're right.

So, we just know off the bat

So, in your example, if you used, you know,

22

machines, implements, et cetera, to do it, at least we'd

know that much.

24

raising is more in the second stage, which is, okay, it

25

isn't just a mere principle.

I think the problem that Your Honor is

I get that.

Alderson Reporting Company

But are we as

Official

43
1

a practical matter pre-empting an abstract idea in such

2

a way that we are going to too greatly suppress

3

follow-on invention.

4

Your Honor, is the Morse case, of course.

5

And the classic example of that,

In Morse, there were two different claims

6

that were being discussed, actually eight different

7

claims being discussed.

8

with the actual invention of how you can make a

9

telegraph work.

10
11

But one of the claims had to do

And Morse described a working telegraph

system, and he got a patent for that.
And the second one that he tried to claim

12

was the use of electricity to write at a distance.

13

the reason he didn't get that one is that it was

14

expressed at such a level -- high level of abstraction,

15

that it would pre-empt many, many things that he had

16

never invented and never thought of.

17

Court's words were wonderful in that case:

18

now know, the Court said, somebody may come up with

19

wonderful inventions in the future.

20

we have the fax machine, e-mail, et cetera.

21

And

In fact, the
For aught we

And, of course, now

That's the right way to think about it,

22

which is, is the -- for the second step, which is, is

23

what's being claimed at such a high level of generality

24

that it's going to inhibit future innovation.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why couldn't someone come

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

up with the idea that at a level which is in the range

2

that's within your patent, if at a certain level for a

3

certain -- a person of a certain age, you administer a

4

new drug, you have a new result?

5

6

MR. BRESS:

Why isn't that like

Your Honor, in that case, they

7

could get an improvement patent on it, first of all, no

8

question about it, that they could apply for an

9

improvement patent.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MR. BRESS:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

But the --

They're building on it.
-- Petitioner is saying

that if you think about that, it's an infringement.

14

MR. BRESS:

Well, there's a -- let me

15

explain why I think there's not a problem with that,

16

Your Honor.

17

vulcanizing rubber, which Firestone patented many, many

18

years ago, that involved you heat India rubber to a high

19

temperature, you add sulfur and mineral salts, and that

20

way you cure rubber into a usable way of using it.

21

If you looked at the process for

Now, many years later in Diehr, this Court

22

looked at a -- an improved process, if you will, for

23

making rubber which -- which involved continuous

24

measurement and the use of the Arrhenius equation to

25

know when the rubber was cured.

Now, there's no doubt

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

that if somebody came out with a second one 10 years

2

after Firestone had gotten the patent on -- on

3

vulcanization, they would have had to pay patent

4

royalties for 10 years before their second one would

5

have been free of patent royalties, right, because they

6

would have had to respect the patent that Firestone got.

7

So, the simple fact, in other words, that

8

there may be further improvements to what you've done

9

isn't where the Court has ever drawn the line.

And I do

10

think that in conceptualizing where to draw these

11

lines -- because at the edges they're indeterminate,

12

they're elusive, and you're going to be somewhat

13

arbitrary.

14

you've got to look to is what you've done before.

15

This is judge-made law.

I think that what

And if we take this case in the spectrum of

16

what this Court has looked at, where you've got Morse on

17

one side, on that same side you've got Benson, which was

18

simply a formula for converting binary coded decimals to

19

pure binary, which the Court said you could use for an

20

infinite number of uses.

21

It was way too broad.

If you look at Bilski, a general way of -- a

22

general -- the concept of hedging.

23

limited, admittedly, and this Court discussed it and

24

said, well, they've tried to limit it with the

25

conventional step of having the inputs determined by

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, Bilski was

Official

46

random analysis techniques.

2

for a second, because the Court said that was not

3

significant extra solution activity.

4

to either render the process a physical one in the world

5

or to narrow its scope.

6

random analysis techniques are themselves just an

7

abstract idea.

8

another one, and it's no wonder the Court found that it

9

didn't narrow it to a patentable scope.

10

I'd like to focus on that

It wasn't enough

Well, why is that?

Because

So, you were adding one abstract idea to

Now, on the other side of the line, we've

11

cases Tilghman.

12

was a patent on the fact that if you use water at a high

13

heat and high pressure, you can separate out from fat

14

bodies the fatty acids, on the one hand, and the

15

glycerin, on the other.

And this Court approved a -- a

16

patent process on that.

Now, that's of course a natural

17

law, Justice Alito, no question about it, in terms of is

18

it a law of nature that makes you do that?

19

Now, if you look at Tilghman, Tilghman

Yes.

But the Court was comforted in that case by

20

the fact that the patent wasn't trying to generally

21

patent -- monopolize the idea that water at high

22

pressure and temperature is going to in general break

23

bonds of chemicals.

24

monopolize the whole idea of how you can separate fat

25

acids and glycerin from fat bodies.

And it wasn't trying to either

Alderson Reporting Company

There are other

Official

47
1

ways, including the use of sulfuric acid.

2

Let's place this case in the continuum.

3

Now, we're not trying to patent the general broad idea

4

that you can use metabolite readings after you've

5

administered a drug to determine what the likely -- what

6

the best level of the next administration might be.

7

That would be kind of like the Morse patent, and that's

not what we're doing.

All right, Your Honor, first of

8

all, the -- most of the claims here have three steps.

9

So, you've got an administering step which clearly

10

carries its own benefits with it.

11

novel, but it's certainly a process step and in and of

12

itself could be a process.

14

and the next step gives the doctor valuable information

15

in order to decide what to do next.

16

It's not -- it's not

We couple that with

Now, why didn't we say, if it's over 400,

17

you must decrease?

Because that doesn't correspond with

18

how doctors practice medicine, Your Honor.

example, you've got a patient for whom you've got a

20

particularly sharp outbreak of Crohn's disease.

well be willing to go above the normal 400 level if your

modern days, because I think it's helpful now to move

13

this forward, the Court has never suggested that there's

14

an extra statutory limitation that prevents patents on

developing useful information, even if they have a

They were used together before we did them,
but why were they used?

They were used by people who

10

were trying to come up with what we came up with.

11

weren't doing it for fun.

12

They were determining in order to try to find a new

13

treatment method, a new way of calibrating the right

14

dose for each individual patient based on their

15

metabolism, and help seriously ill patients.

16

They

They were administering.

And the idea that we are not novel because

17

people took some of the same steps along the way to

18

invention that we actually succeeded in is wrong.

19

in fact, this Court said so in American Wood-Paper,

20

where it said that incomplete and unsuccessful attempts

21

to invent will not render not novel the successful

22

inventor.

23

And,

And, in Bell, the Court said the difference

24

between those who -- those who did not get the patents

25

and Bell was only the difference between failure and

There's another

13

at the very edges of the spectrums that we're claiming,

the answer is obvious.

can seek to try to invalidate our patents on that basis

as well.

In fact, it's killing patients.

Similarly, suppose

The answer is not novel.

This -- these aren't 101 problems.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

Well, it seems to me

19

that's your -- the problem with your whole approach is

20

that every time you're pressed on 101, your answer is to

21

fall back to 102 or 103 or the utility part of 101.

22

I'm just wondering why it's beneficial to essentially

23

eliminate 101 and say, oh, we'll catch everything later

24

on.

25

MR. BRESS:

And

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

appreciate the question.

2

I -- I think that the answer is that when

3

the problem is lack of novelty, when the problem is

4

obviousness, the right place to go are the sections that

5

actually have very clear rules on how to apply those,

6

and that the problem with taking a short cut in that

7

instance is, essentially, the court would just imbue its

8

own notions or preconceived notions of what should be

9

patentable and pour it into it as opposed to following

10

those rules.

11

And, of course, if you're going to follow

12

these rules, you might as well follow them under that

13

section.

14

This Court has said 101's very broad, but it does have

15

limitations.

Now, it doesn't completely leave 101 bereft.

And if you look at a case like Morse --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. BRESS:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but just to --

-- I think it helps explain it.
Sorry to interrupt.

19

Your friend's point is that if you don't do this -- if

20

you don't give 101 some more content, then the doctor is

21

going to have to start worrying right from the get-go

22

and then see, well, is there an exception that I might

23

be able to rely on, as opposed to being able to say

24

right away this -- I don't have to worry about this

25

patent; I can treat the patient in this way.

MR. BRESS:

Well, Your Honor, again, if --

2

if it's very clear that we're not novel.

3

if -- if the Government is correct here that facially we

4

lack novelty, it's no harder to proceed under 102 to

5

achieve that goal than it is under 101.

6

to proceed under 101, then we'll talk about principles

7

that 101 is for.

For example,

If you're going

So, 101 -- I think the primary -- the two
things it's for -- it has to be a process in the

10

physical world, a hands-on process, and it can't be so

11

broad that it pre-empts all follow-on innovation.

12

are the two things -- you know, this Court speaks sums

13

about the statutory language, and it has to do some

14

work.

Those

your answer about why this is novel?

MR. BRESS:

Right.

Your Honor, before

Prometheus -- actually, the inventors in this case in

right dosage of these powerful but potentially toxic

drugs.
