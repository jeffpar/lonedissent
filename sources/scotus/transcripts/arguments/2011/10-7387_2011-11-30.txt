CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

States.

Mr. Hawkins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON D. HAWKINS

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HAWKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case concerns whether, in passing the

12

Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Congress granted to the

13

Federal district court the authority to order a Federal

14

sentence to run consecutively to a -- a sentence which

15

has yet to be imposed and may never come to fruition.

16

The text of 3584, its structure, and its history all

17

point to the conclusion that the court lacks this power.

18

We believe the question should start and end

19

with the statute's text.

When a defendant receives

20

multiple terms of imprisonment, they must bear one of

21

three relationships to each other.

22

imposed before the other, the other is imposed before

23

the one, or they are imposed at the same time.

24

In --

We believe that the third sentence only

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Some fairly respected

18

jurists below, Judge Easterbrook and Judge Fletcher, two

19

different circuits, have read it as taking care of all

20

those situations that the other two sentences don't

21

cover.

22

Why is that an irrational reading?
MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, I -- I think it

23

has to be read -- the third sentence has to be read in

24

its place within the statute, and I think that the third

25

sentence refers exclusively to circumstances where the

Alderson Reporting Company

defendant was already serving another term of

2

imprisonment at the time of the Federal sentencing.

3

I think we know this because of the parallel structure

of 3584(a).

You would say that at the

That is correct, Your Honor.

23

At the time of the Federal sentencing, Mr. -- Mr. Setser

24

was not subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.

Why would the -- why would

sentencing judge?

25

reasoning was that the -- the undischarged term of

2

for which probation had previously been granted and

3

there had been a violation of the probation, that that

had nothing to do with his subsequent Federal drug

5

charges, and, therefore, the Federal drug charges should

6

run consecutively to that but should be concurrent to

7

any sentence imposed by the State court on the State

8

drug charges.

9

What -- you know, what's wrong with that

10

reasoning, and what additional insight relevant to that

11

reasoning would be obtained by waiting until after the

12

sentence was imposed?

13

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, at the time

14

that the Federal judge passed this sentence, he had no

15

idea what was going to happen in either case.

16

importantly, with regard to the term of probation, the

17

Federal judge had no idea whether that term was going to

18

be revoked, whether it would be modified, or whether he

19

would receive any sentence of -- of imprisonment at all.

20

But more

And in making the judgment on whether those

21

terms should run concurrently or consecutively, Your

Honor, 3584(b) directs the court to look at the factors

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, the -- the Bureau

several of those factors match up with the factors in

So, you've got some guy deciding whether the

goals of the criminal justice system require this person

14

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

15

what the -- the law requires is that the Bureau of

16

Prisons has to look at these factors under 3621(b), and

17

those program statements are trying to define what those

18

exact factors are.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, doesn't it

20

seem strange to you that a Federal bureaucrat sitting --

21

a regional director -- and I guess there are about a

22

half dozen of them -- sits somewhere and decides whether

23

a defendant -- say there's a 10-year Federal sentence, a

24

10-year State sentence, and that person says, well, I

25

think he ought to serve another 10 years, or I think

Alderson Reporting Company

11

he's done.

2

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, to -- to be

3

clear, I mean, Mr. Setser is going to have to serve a

4

151 -- a 151-month term of imprisonment no matter what.

5

But the bureaucrat that -- that you're talking about,

6

the bureaucrat will be -- only be making that

7

determination after having the complete information

8

which the Federal judge --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know, but --

10

but it's a big deal to be sentenced to, in my

11

hypothetical, another 10 years in prison.

12

how much information the bureaucrat has.

13

MR. HAWKINS:

I don't care

Well, Your Honor, but still

14

that -- that person has the -- has the information

15

before it, and it's also subject to judicial review

16

under 2241.

17

where the petitioner can -- or the prisoner can ask for

18

this --

19

I would point out that there is a process

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it's judicial

20

review of what?

21

the desire of the State court or not.

22

as to whether they abused their discretion.

23

Not of the -- not of whether that was

MR. HAWKINS:

Judicial review

Yes, Your Honor.

And I

24

believe that's -- that's the same discretion that the

25

court has when its deciding a sentence on direct appeal.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you're going to make

2

a bureaucrat equal to a judge in making the most

3

important decision that a defendant faces:

4

time he should spend in jail.

5

than a judge, decides whether he's going to tack on a

6

year and a half, 5, or 10, or whether he's going to let

7

the defendant serve it concurrently?

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, again, it -- it's

not the who for us, but the when.

MR. HAWKINS:

22

passed to take the decision away from the bureaucrat,

23

that the courts could not order a Federal sentence to

24

run concurrently with an undischarged State term of

imprisonment.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let's answer

3

Justice Scalia's point.

4

parole board used to make this decision, and they wanted

6

to put it back in the hands of judges?

7

MR. HAWKINS:

Wasn't the SRA passed in part

Well, that's part of the

8

reason, Your Honor, but in passage of 3621, it also

9

highlighted the fact that it was not seeking to take

10

away the bureaucratic authority that the Bureau of

11

Prisons have for designation.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And back to the -I don't know why it

13

takes away from them on that score.

14

whatever facility they want within the constraints

15

imposed by a judge in terms of the length of the

16

sentence.

17

MR. HAWKINS:

They can choose

Well, I mean -- I guess, yes,

18

Your Honor, that is part of it, but that only comes into

19

play when the first sentence does not apply and when the

20

court does not have the requisite information.

21

estimation, it is better for the latter sentencing

22

entity, that with the most sentencing information, to be

23

able to make this -- this ultimate determination in --

24

in looking at the Federal court's views, versus allowing

25

a Federal judge who's prognosticating about what the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT,

8

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Federal district courts do decide how long a

12

defendant should be in prison for his Federal crime, but

13

for many years, both before and after the Sentencing

14

Reform Act, the Attorney General through the Bureau of

15

Prisons has decided where the sentence will be served

16

and when it shall commence.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not clear on what the

18

-- what the Government's view of, whatever you want to

19

call it, inherent judicial sentencing power is.

20

you -- before section 3584 was passed, there -- there

21

was the power on the part of the Federal courts to

22

decide whether sentences should run concurrently or

23

sequentially, right?

24

MR. JAY:

25

Honor.

You --

Not with a State sentence, Your

Before section 3584(a) was passed, a Federal

be quite --

because I did go back and look at the '79 Senate report

Alderson Reporting Company

17

on S.1, which was the whole reform from beginning to

2

end, and my reading of that section suggests to me that

3

they thought past practice was exactly what they wrote

4

in this statute.

5

I read it.

6

But I thought they were thinking that the Federal judge

7

does have the power to sentence concurrently or

8

consecutively with a term that a Federal court or a

9

State court has imposed in the past, but -- but you

All right.

Now -- at least that's how

Maybe I didn't read it carefully enough.

10

can't do this monkey business that they're -- I agree

11

with you on that.

12

There was nothing about trying to make

13

something concurrent or consecutive with a -- a State

14

term that hasn't yet been imposed.

15

you can't do it; it just gets into a -- at least not

16

with a consecutive.

17

MR. JAY:

You couldn't do it;

Well, let me see if I can answer

18

both Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer.

There are cases

19

that we cite at page 16 of our reply brief.

20

cases, Justice Breyer, you may want to look at the

21

Senate report on the -- on what actually became section

22

23

says that it changes the law.

He could recommend it.

that's the way it's being done.

20

MR. JAY:

That is the way it's being done,

21

Justice Kennedy.

Indeed, every time the bureau

22

designates a Federal prison or a State prison, it's

23

after the person comes into Federal custody, except in

cases where the person voluntarily surrenders.

MR. JAY:

I think if they

Mr. Chief Justice, Federal

17

inmates, since the passage of the first Federal crime in

18

1790, have served their time in State prisons.

19

were no Federal penitentiaries for more than 100 years.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

There

It seems to me that the

24

question of how long someone should spend in prison,

25

which is what's involved in determining whether --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

deciding whether a sentence is going to be served

2

consecutively or concurrently, is very different from

3

determining where the sentence is going to be -- where a

4

sentence is going to be served.

5

Isn't this a very strange reading of -- of

6

3621, to say that that grants the BOP the authority to

7

make this concurrent/consecutive determination?

8
9

MR. JAY:
Alito.

I don't think so at all, Justice

Let me give two reasons why.

The first is that

10

before section 3584 was enacted, this -- the predecessor

11

of this statute, which was section 4082, was the reason

12

that Federal courts recognized that they didn't have the

13

power to prescribe concurrent treatment of a Federal

14

sentence with a previously existing State sentence.

15

That's one point.

16

The second point is, as Mr. Hawkins

17

mentioned, the quantum of Federal punishment, a

18

punishment for the Federal offense, that's up to the

19

Federal district judge to prescribe; but where -- where

20

that time will be served and whether the time has to

21

commence before, after, or during the defendant's

22

service of another sentence, that's a where and when

23

question.

24

up to the Attorney General.

25

And where and when questions have always been

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I -- can I take you back

3

to 3584?

So, 3584 talks about these two situations,

4

simultaneously imposed terms and undischarged terms, and

5

let's assume that all three sentences talk about only

6

those two situations.

7

that, in talking about those two situations, Congress

8

rejected judicial authority when it came to a third

9

situation.

The premise of your argument is

MR. JAY:

Well, I will -- I will assume with

19

you, Justice Kagan, although you know that I disagree,

20

that the -- that this is conscious.

21

First, there was no inherent authority beforehand.

22

Congress couldn't have been carrying forward existing

practice, because, as I've said, there was no inherent

24

authority for district courts to make this decision

before.

three possible relationships.

Either the Federal term

10

Now, our problem is that the State judge may

conduct's different.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN A. YOUNG

16

ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE,

17

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

18

MR. YOUNG:

19

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

As this Court stated nearly a century ago in

21

Ex parte United States, under our constitutional system

22

the right to impose the punishment provided by law is

23

judicial.

24
25

Congress does not transfer such core
authority from one branch to another without clearly and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

expressly saying so.

2

provision of the Sentencing Reform Act even remotely

3

approaches the clarity that Congress would use if it

4

intended to restrict judicial sentencing in cases like

5

Setser's.

6

Neither section 3584 nor any other

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Government says that

7

the Federal courts never had that power anyway, so that

8

nothing is being restricted.

9

that you've cited as demonstrating the existence of that

And they contest the cases

10

power in the situation involved here to -- to determine

11

whether a future -- a sentence to be imposed in the

12

future by State courts will be concurrent or consecutive

13

with the Federal one.

14

MR. YOUNG:

Against -- that is wrong,

15

because against a number of cases that we cite -- and I

16

would commend them to the Court -- in which Federal

17

judges previous to the Sentencing Reform Act

18

anticipatorily sentenced, the Government and Mr. Setser

19

have provided zero cases before the Sentencing Reform --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nobody found that out in

21

1980 -- in 1980 or '79.

22

report on that, they don't refer to any of those cases.

23

They write it as if it was just as Justice Scalia and

24

the -- and the Government said.

25

If you look through the Senate

And, honestly, my question really is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

same one -- maybe I didn't put it clearly, but I think

2

you understood it -- that the reason that they want the

3

Federal judge to be able to shape his sentence in light

4

of other sentences that either the Federal courts or the

5

State courts have given in the past is because you can

6

do it so that a single behavior gets a single sentence

7

and a different behavior is going to be sentenced

8

consecutively, presumptively.

9

But you just can't do that where the State

10

court hasn't yet acted, because -- at least you can't do

11

it in the consecutive case, because the State court

12

judge sees what you did, and he may decide:

13

want it to be consecutive.

14

sentence to be served concurrently with the Federal

15

court sentence.

16

I don't

So, here I am; I write in my

Now, you can have every agency you want in

17

the Federal Government, but there's no way to get around

18

that.

19

different, and you can't muck around with your Federal

20

sentence in a way that will make it consecutive to a

21

State court sentence that says it's going to run

22

concurrent.

23

You can't force that State judge to do something

So, there's a practical problem, and that's

24

why it's left out.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your Honor, I think -Can you tell me what the

answer to that is?

I think the answer is that it

5

turns much more on the order of imprisonment than the

6

order of sentencing, because the Federal court in Mr.

7

Setser's case, for instance, is imposing no obligation

8

whatsoever on the State.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't deny that there are

10

many instances where you could get it to work,

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

He can do that.

And that's all he did do.
Oh, I know.

That's all that matters -I don't deny there can be

7

some.

I say there is a concern that if he were to say

8

in a different case, I want the gun thing which is going

9

to State court to be consecutive, that he can't control

10

that.

Because the State court judge could say I want my

11

gun sentence, State, to run concurrently with Federal.

12

MR. YOUNG:

What the State judge could not

13

do is to say I want this State sentence, which is going

14

to be served first, to run concurrent to the

15

later-served Federal sentence.

require the Federal sovereign to let someone go.

the premise that it's a grant, which I think is not the

10

best way to read it, but if it's a grant of authority,

11

still the correct answer is it says nothing at all about

12

For several reasons, one of

12

And so, there's nothing for it yet to be

A second answer is that all Federal

13

sentences are served under the jailer of the same

14

sovereign, the Federal; whereas in the anticipatory

15

context, we have two different systems.

16

first sentencing federal judge is the only judge that

17

can compel the jailer of the Federal sovereign to either

18

credit or not to credit; whereas in the Federal/Federal

19

system, under the statute, the second judge is

20

explicitly given the power to alter the default rule.

21

So, in all Federal cases, either a default rule or a

22

judge will determine whether or not a credit should be

23

given to the defendant.

the -- the argument that the judge who anticipates a

second sentence may be wrong?

will be.

Now, there is a statutory provision that

does describe exactly how the Bureau of Prisons should

interact with the courts in the context of a sentence

10

that needs to be changed, and that's section 3582(c).

11

And in that statute, the -- the judge will remain the

12

decider because the Bureau of Prisons goes as a

13

petitioner and says to the court there are compelling

14

and extraordinary reasons to modify this sentence.

15

And then the court, always in the position

16

of the decider and using the section 3553(a) factors,

17

will decide whether or not the Bureau of Prisons'

petition should be granted.

And, in fact, the sentencing factors that

preliminary requirement.

"The Bureau may designate any

that the Bureau of Prisons has to make a sentence

8

most in need of that judicial mercy would be precluded

MR. YOUNG:

And to say that

necessarily means that it is the judge.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, let me ask you this

5

then:

Is it -- is it -- if we want the judge to be able

6

to say this particular prisoner will serve his Federal

7

sentence after the State gun sentence is served or,

8

alternatively, with the State gun sentence, the 3621

9

says that -- that the judge can, if that sentence, State

10

sentence, has not yet been imposed, we don't know what

11

it is -- we don't know if it will be imposed.

12

know what they're going to say.

13

they're going to sentence him to -- count his time, time

14

served in the Federal jail.

15

they're going to say in Federal prison.

20

21

22

behavior I would like punished by 2 years more.

23

A statement "concerning the purposes for

Prisons follows it.

And if they don't follow it, they

25

2

discretion.

Now, will that solve the problem.
MR. YOUNG:

It doesn't, Your Honor, because

3

what that factor allows the Bureau of Prisons to do is

4

to decide, based upon the judgment here, is this someone

5

who needs to be in the super-max or is it someone that

6

can be in a much more minimum security type prison?

7

None of this has anything to do with the

8

determination of how long someone should spend in

9

prison, 10 years, 20 years.

The Government says it's

10

all the same; you'll serve your Federal prison term.

11

doesn't seem that from the perspective of an identically

12

situated person who will spend 20 years rather than 10

13

years of his life in prison.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

Am -- am I correct, Mr.

15

Young, that if -- if the Federal sentencing judge is

16

erroneous in his prediction of what the State court

17

later sentencing will do, that his order, based upon

18

that erroneous prediction, can be altered upon appeal by

19

the Bureau of Prisons?

20

MR. YOUNG:

That's correct.

And the only

21

situation in which a prisoner would be harmed is if the

23

then the Bureau of Prisons comes in later, 20 years

that helps you.

11

You said it's either the jailer or the

Yes.
Whoever the second

10

judge is can figure out exactly how long he thinks the

11

sentence should run and give a sentence accordingly.

12

MR. YOUNG:

That cannot be the case if it's

a State court and the State court does not know, with

respect to a later-served Federal sentence, whether or

15

not the time will be credited.

MR. YOUNG:

In the case in which the -- the

that the State relinquishes its custody.

They've sentenced him

If the State judge knows, however, that the
Federal court has sentenced someone to 5 years and it

will be consecutive because it's served last to whatever

position, and only in that situation, is in a position

13

to say, okay, if I give you 2 years, you will spend 7,

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. YOUNG:

Precisely.

The only way to

really respect the second sentencing State judge is to

provide clarity, rather than to force that State judge

11

of the State -- that's why the Federal bookends, I

5

MR. YOUNG:

Everything is silent.

I think

6

it was not.

As to the question about whether courts

7

could impose concurrent consecutive sentences, what the

8

report says, footnotes 310, 314, 318, pages 126, 127,

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

There was simply a

Well, in order for you to

7

prevail, I think we -- is it correct, we would have to

8

determine that there was this authority inherent in the

9

judiciary prior to the enactment of this statute?

10

MR. YOUNG:

I don't think that that is

11

necessarily true.

12

there can be no question that concurrent and consecutive

13

sentencing is inherently and quintessentially judicial.

14

This court in Oregon v. Ice only two terms ago regarded

15

it that way.

16

I think it makes it much easier.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

Yes, with respect to Federal

17

sentences, certainly that's true.

But with respect to

18

Federal and State sentences, it may be, as you

19

suggested, that this just didn't come up very often

20

until the enactment probably of the Federal drug laws

21

and -- and a few other statutes that created offenses

22

where you have -- where the same conduct would

13

MR. YOUNG:

In that case, if the choice is

14

between the judge and the jailer, I think the choice is

15

clear.

16

something as quintessentially judicial as deciding how

17

long someone would spend in prison must be decided by

18

the executive branch, questionable whether it could, but

19

unless it explicitly said this is how we want it to

20

happen, there can be no doubt that imposing extra

21

punishment or withdrawing punishment is so judicial in

22

nature that, even if Congress didn't think about it and

23

explicitly address the problem, the tie certainly has to

24

go to the judge.

25

If Congress did not specifically say that

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it isn't a tie.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's

52
1

-- I mean, there's one thing on each side.

2

is the fact that the sentencing judge, Federal, is

3

trying to figure out his own sentence, and he does --

either he does want or he doesn't want that particular

5

individual to serve additional time, should a State

6

court judge later decide on some related or unrelated

7

matter.

8
9

On your side

All right?
And if that were all that was at issue, and

the choice is between his saying -- just doing it,

10

writing it in the sentence, or he's writing down his

11

reasons what he'd like to have happen and letting the

12

Bureau implement that as best they can under the section

13

we are talking about.

14

says let the judge do it; don't give the implementation.

That's on the one side.

And that

15

On the other side is to let the judge do it

16

risks complex interference with the second to sentence,

who is the State court judge.

18

It may be you're right that there's some way

19

of working it out, but it sounds complicated to me,

20

particularly in -- in the consecutive case.

So, we have federalism principles on one

hand, versus the judge, versus the bureaucracy on the

other.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the dual

minimum.

21

sentence the person to 10 years, then your explanation

22

falls apart.

23

Right?

If the State court judge has to

MR. YOUNG:

If State law has a particular

24

requirement as Federal law in some cases -- 924(c)

25

does -- then that's the way dual sovereignty works as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

well.

But there is never a situation in which a State

2

judge is worse off by having the knowledge of what the

3

Federal court will sentence -- has sentenced and how

4

that sentence will be imposed.

5

Again, if there's a problem with it, the

6

Bureau of Prisons has a way to solve it, and it's

7

through section 3582(c).

8

determination, 20 years later perhaps, seeking the

9

advice of a judge.

It's not through a unilateral

Maybe the advice of the judge is

10

provided at the time of sentencing.

11

that, there's no reason why it couldn't be an order that

12

can be enforced rather than a piece of advice that is

13

given at the time of sentencing.

14

And if it can do

Judges decide how much punishment someone

15

should receive.

16

how long someone should spend in the Federal Bureau of

17

Prisons.

18

sentences within the strictures of State law to account

19

for what they know is coming if Federal courts are able

20

to provide that advice.

21

In Federal court, Federal judges decide

State courts can't do it, but they can adjust

And if they cannot decide that issue and

22

advise the State court judge of what will happen, then

23

there are situations that will occur when the Bureau of

24

Prisons administers these sentences, and there's no

25

question about that either.

But the point is there is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

never a situation in which a judge, able and willing --

2

able to follow the section 3553(a) factors and willing

3

to impose that sentence, is doing something that will be

4

worse for the defendant or worse for the States than if

5

he does not do it.

6

You contrast the -- the two situations that

7

two equally situated people would be in.

On the one

8

hand, sentencing in open court by an Article III judge

9

subject to the section 3553(a) factors with direct

10

review in the courts for reasonableness.

11

hand, sentencing by administrator without any of those

12

salutary procedural protections, without direct review

13

in the courts, and based on factors that determine to

14

which prison someone should go, not how long they must

15

stay there for purposes of punishment.

16

On the other

And for that reason alone, if for none

17

other, the Court should affirm the judgment because it

18

allows district judges, subject to their wise exercise

19

and sound exercise of discretion, to make these

20

sentences to clarify things upfront for everyone:

21

defendant, the State courts, and the Bureau of Prisons.

22

the

Twenty years, this country has had half of

23

the circuits following this practice, and there's not

24

one case cited on the other side showing that any

25

mal-administration of justice has resulted, any lack of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

clarity, any problems with respect to how these

2

sentences are enforced.

3

And that's because it does the opposite.

4

Allowing judges who are able, in cases like Setser's, no

5

revocation, no Federal credit should be given to it.

the Bureau of Prisons.

10
11

He

He knows everything he needs to know to
He made it.

It's effectuated by

The Government has not said once

that it cannot enforce that sentence.
And to the extent that Setser wishes to

12

challenge how the Bureau of Prisons credits the State

13

order, the mechanism to do that is to exhaust his

14

administration -- administrative remedies in the BOP and

15

then seek judicial review to determine whether that

16

calculation was done rationally and fairly.

17

This appeal is not the place for that.

18

appeal is to determine whether district courts never

19

have such authority.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JASON D. HAWKINS

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

25

MR. HAWKINS:

Thank you.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

Justice Breyer, if I could go back to your

2

hypothetical, I think that the way that the Federal

3

judge can get this accomplished is simply by waiting.

4

After -- after the -- the conviction, Your

5

Honor, they can send a State prisoner back down to State

6

court, allow for that State sentence to be imposed, and

7

then he can come back into Federal custody.

8

situation, that is when the court has the authority to

9

issue this binding order.

10

And in that

That is the -- because it has

all of the information.

11

And -- and I would also --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's preferable, to

13

clog the judicial system with untold number of Federal

14

convictions that have not been reduced to judgment?

15

That's preferable to giving judges or recognizing their

16

power to state their views up front?

17

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, the judge can

18

state the views -- her views up front in a

19

recommendation.

20

the facts.

21

It cannot do so if it doesn't know all

It cannot bind -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

22

facts would affect the sentence here?

The judge here

23

very clearly believed that some of the State charges

24

overlapped and some didn't.

25

consecutive to one set of State charges and concurrent

And so, it ran some

to the other.

2
3

What are the facts with respect to the
defendant that the Federal court needed to know?

4

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, I think in looking

5

at 3584, it may well seem reasonable for the Federal

6

court to have done this, but the -- the fact is, is that

7

Congress drew a bright line, and he has to be subject to

8

this undischarged term of imprisonment.
