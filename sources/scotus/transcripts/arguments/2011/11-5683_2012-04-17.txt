ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. EBERHARDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

11

The judges of the Seventh Circuit are

12

unanimous in their belief that this case raises a good

13

question.

14

would Congress want district courts to continue to

15

impose sentences that were universally viewed as unfair

16

and racially discriminatory?

17

And, of course, that good question is:

Why

My colleague sitting on the other side of

18

the podium, I submit to the Court, does not answer that

19

question.

20

question can be found in the text of the Fair Sentencing

21

Act.

22

answer, the text gives us the required fair implication.

23
24
25

Petitioners feel that the answer to that

And while we admit that there is no express

The text in section 8, the text in section
10 -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Is a fair

Official

1

implication enough?

2

essentially, of an earlier provision, section 109.

3

our cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear

4

implication, unquestionable implication.

5
6

You're talking here about a repeal,
And

Do you think this is really clear and
unquestionable?

7

MR. EBERHARDT:

No, it is not, but the

8

standard from this Court, Justice Scalia, is fair

9

implication, and it has been ever since Great -- the

10

Great Northern case.

11

sorry -- as a necessary implication in Great Northern,

12

moved to plain and clear implication in Hertz and

13

Woodman, and then Marrero, which is relied on heavily by

14

amicus.

15

It -- the standards began -- I'm

Of course, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Talking about

That is correct.
So, we're pretty far

removed from the language of the statute, I guess.

21

MR. EBERHARDT:

But, again, ever since 1908,

22

that's a standard that this Court has not accepted.

23

this is based on the provision, the well-settled

24

provision, that an earlier Congress cannot bind a later

25

Congress.

And

standard?

They would have known section 109 required an

9

So, why shouldn't we hold them to that

MR. EBERHARDT:

The answer is no, I don't

believe that Congress felt that that was the standard.

10

Again relying on this Court's jurisprudence that said

11

you give us text and if we are able to find that the

12

fair implication and the intent of Congress through that

13

fair implication is that this new statute applies,

14

because an earlier Congress cannot bind the newer

15

Congress -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on your statement

that the -­

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did it -­

20

bind a later Congress, do you mean we're not supposed to

25

We're not supposed to look at the

Oh, absolutely, the Court

And we acknowledge -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, then -- so, then the

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

fact that 109 is on the books is relevant.

2

it's not a question of one Congress binding the other.

3

It's a question of what the second Congress did.

4

MR. EBERHARDT:

And -- and

Yes, 109 is relevant, but

5

it's the standard to be employed in determining whether

6

or not there's a fair implication of what the later

7

Congress meant.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
"fair implication" -­

I mean, there are a lot of earlier cases

that make it clear when you're repealing a prior statute

if it isn't express, it has to be at least a clear

implication.

simply "fair implication."

And I'm -- I'm astounded to think that in

Well, that's a different

And we can talk about that.

But how did

Did it -- did it find an overruling

MR. EBERHARDT:

Marrero primarily was based

18

on the fact that there was a specific provision for

19

nonretroactivity.

held that 109 would also be relevant to the decision.

In an alternate holding, the Court

21

Marrero, though, was a habeas -­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

So, it did not find 109

overcome by fair implication, right?

24

MR. EBERHARDT:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Correct.
So, it's entirely dictum,

And dictum in a footnote.

MR. EBERHARDT:

alternative holding, because the primary holding in -­

way.

I thought it was the other

The holding was that 109 governed.

6

MR. EBERHARDT:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No?

I'm sorry.
I thought you said the

8

holding was that section 109 governed, that it had not

9

been repealed.

10

MR. EBERHARDT:

109 was the alternative

11

holding, saying that 109 would also preclude the

12

retroactivity provision.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

And, therefore,

14

whatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of

15

109 was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not

16

repealed.

17

was not the test applied and determinative in the case.

18

So, it's dictum.

So, even if fair implication was the test, it

And dictum in a footnote.

19

MR. EBERHARDT:

I don't agree, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

All right.
But that's true of all of

22

the cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or

23

three that use "fair implication."

24

those cases found that there was no fair implication, so

25

that 109 governed.

1

Isn't -- isn't that so?

2

That was true in Marrero.

3

It was true in

Northern Securities.

4

MR. EBERHARDT:

In Marrero, the primary

5

holding was based on the fact that there was a specific

6

provision for nonretroactivity.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in none of the cases

8

that used the fair implication language did the Court

9

say:

And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.

10

MR. EBERHARDT:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, you're relying on a

12

standard that this Court did -- must have considered

13

appropriate because it deviated from the words of the

14

statute.

15

it always came out the same way.

It said it a few times.

16

MR. EBERHARDT:

But in application,

Well, in application, when

17

the Court applied this in Marcello, when they were

18

weighing the language of the Administrative Procedure

19

Act as opposed to the language of the Immigration and

20

Nationality Act, I think the Court made clear, as it

21

went through the statute there, that there was a fair

22

implication.

23

implication, it necessarily means that there is some

24

kind of an ambiguity.

25

And then once you get to the point of fair

And then the Court followed up saying that
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we then did look to the legislative history, and the

2

legislative history backs up the implication that we did

3

find.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was not true of

5

the 109 cases.

6

standard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old

7

statute is not enforced.

8

You don't have a 109 case that said the

Directly?

Do you think that if -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think that if we

I don't believe

so.

13

stick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed,

14

looking for an express provision, do you agree that

15

there isn't any here?

16

MR. EBERHARDT:

We agree there is no express

17

provision, but obviously, we also contend that going

18

back to the proposition that an earlier Congress cannot

19

bind a later, that that standard has been rejected even

20

though argued by my colleague to my left.

21

longer the standard ever since -­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is no

Well, I'm not sure he's

23

arguing that.

I think he acknowledges, as our opinions

24

say, that it can be done by implication, but it has to

25

be clear and unmistakable implication.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

I think that's

Official

1

the position he's taking.

2
3

Anyway, you want to tell me why this is
clear and unmistakable?

4

MR. EBERHARDT:

When you look at the

5

language of section 8, when Congress has mandated the

6

Sentencing Commission to use their emergency authority

7

to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions

8

and applicable law, it makes clear that Congress meant

9

this needs to take effect as soon as possible.

Congress

10

even said "as soon as practicable and no later than

11

90 days."

12

This would be meaningless, actually, with

13

regard to the individuals who were in this pipeline to

14

be sentenced, because there would be so few individuals

15

who would be arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced

16

within that 90-day period that Congress could only -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there might be a few,

18

but there -- but assume that you're drafting this

19

legislation and you want it to apply only to defendants

20

who commit an offense after the enactment of the Fair

21

Sentencing Act, but you also want to do everything that

22

you reasonably can to make sure that when the very first

23

one of those defendants comes up for sentencing, there

24

will be new sentencing guidelines in effect that are

25

geared to the new lower mandatory minimums rather than

Would you not provide that the -- would you

not require the Sentencing Commission to act as quickly

as possible to get the new sentencing guidelines out?

No.

12

subjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing

13

guidelines?

14

MR. EBERHARDT:

No.

I think it's clear that

15

the average time from charging to sentencing is going to

16

be at least 11 months.

17

to trial, it's going to be much more than that.

18

there really need be no rush on the part of Congress to

condense this down into 90 days.

MR. EBERHARDT:

Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice.

Congress -- Congress knows that because these are the

individuals who drafted the Sentencing Reform Act.

We have to know that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, right.

But I

mean -- and we assume Congress knows the law.

9

know that we can readily assume they know details such

10

as that and evaluate their -- what would your position

11

be if the Congress said do this as soon as practical

12

but, in any event, no later than 8 months from now?

13

Would we then think there's a fair implication that

14

Congress meant it to apply retroactively or not?

15

MR. EBERHARDT:

I don't

On just the point of the

16

immediacy placed on by Congress, I think that would take

17

away from the fair implication that Congress meant that

18

it -- the law should go -- or the law should be

19

effective on the date of the President's signature.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why do you pick the date

21

that the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it -­

22

if what -- if the guidelines, the 90-day period that the

23

Commission came out with its new guidelines on

is when the Sentencing Act.

So, on your theory, why

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

isn't the right date the date that the Sentencing

2

Guidelines went into effect?

3

MR. EBERHARDT:

The correct date is the

4

August 3rd date, Your Honor, because of the intent of

5

Congress made known through the implication of the

6

language taken in the legal context of the Sentencing

7

Reform Act.

8

I believe they made it perfectly clear that they meant

9

to correct this error as soon as possible.

When Congress meant to correct their error,

This has

10

been an error that had been discussed for 25 years and

not only the section 109 cases, but I think, as my

colleague mentioned in Marcello v. Bonds, that there are

16

no magical passwords that Congress has to use to explain

17

itself.

18

And let me give an example because I think

19

that it will help to put in focus why I think the Fair

20

Sentencing Act does contain the requisite implication.

comparable to what you've just said.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think it is because

22

there's a piece of the -- that -- that section that I'd

23

like to draw the Court's attention to, because I think

24

that it critically explains what the Sentencing

25

Commission was supposed to do.

Section 8 is all over

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the briefs, but I have it in the Government's gray brief

2

at page 10a.

3

This is the section that directs the

4

Sentencing Commission to promulgate new guidelines and

5

to exercise its emergency authority -- and I'm going to

6

quote here -- "to make such conforming amendments to the

7

Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission deems

8

necessary to achieve consistency with other guidelines

9

provisions and" -- here's the critical phrase -­

10

"applicable law."

11

That phrase, "applicable law," can only mean

12

sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, which are

13

the provisions that increased the thresholds of

14

quantities necessary to trigger the mandatory minimum

15

sentences.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine.

But it -­

17

they apply that applicable law to those, as you say,

18

admittedly few people who have been prosecuted,

19

convicted, and are now being sentenced under that

20

applicable law.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

But -­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There may not be many of

23

them, but it does not -- it does not deprive that

24

language of all meaning.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I want

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, almost any

law that repeals a prior penalty is doing so because the

in some way, because why do you eliminate a penalty

13

unless you think it is necessary to do so and that it's

injust or unjust in some way?

15

So, what makes this repeal particularly

16

different so that the exception doesn't swallow the

rule, because you can argue in almost any situation that

the repeal is of something that's unjust?

Fairness is on both sides -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Estrada, what's so

22

difficult for a legal doctrine to say that when Congress

23

has made a finding that a law has a discriminatory

24

impact -- because I always thought that when

25

discrimination was at issue, that we should do as speedy
31
Alderson Reporting Company

a remedy as we could, because it is one of the most

2

fundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been

3

repeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws

4

should be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way.

5

Once Congress has said this law's not being

6

enforced in a race-neutral way, we want to fix it, why

7

shouldn't our presumption be that the fix is immediate

8

rather than delayed?

9

MR. ESTRADA:

Because I think it would be

10

wrong to assume that the passage of the Act reflects

11

Congress's concession of intentional discrimination.

12

think it does recognize that there were members of

13

Congress that had concerns about the disparate impact of

14

the law.

15

I

Mr. Estrada, I've been a

16

22

racial implications than this one.

23

MR. ESTRADA:

Justice Sotomayor, that is

24

absolutely right.

But it is very significant that for

25

20 years we had this argument.

The Sentencing

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Commission, as the Government points out, went to

2

Congress again and again and again to say we don't agree

3

with this, this makes no sense.

Congress could not bring itself to change it because

5

there was no agreement on the part of the lawmakers that

6

the public policy was that easy.

7

And for 20 years,

And the fact is you have a whole assortment

8

of bills that were considered by Congress in the last

9

10

history is significant, they're all very instructive.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Estrada, I mean, that's

21

true, that it took Congress a long time to decide to do

this.

23

do this, what did it decide to do; and whether it would

24

make sense, once having decided to do this, to have the

25

guidelines be the new guidelines, but the mandatory

I think the question is, once having decided to

Alderson Reporting Company

And what everybody understood was that if

3

that were the case, if the new guidelines and the

4

old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together,

5

it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way

6

people were sentenced.

7

And so, the question is, once having decided

8

to do this, can't we assume that Congress decided to do

9

it?

10
11

MR. ESTRADA:

No.

Let me give three answers

to that.

points here is that a premise of the law is to treat

16

other we would expect to get comparable punishment if

17

19

undermines that even though that is exactly what section

20

109 says.

21

And people who committed the same

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you have to draw a

line someplace, and that's inevitable, that -- that some

23

people are going to fall on one side.

24

about the guidelines and the statute working together,

1

they wanted to do away with this distinction and

2

Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do

3

it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do

4

it to the statute?

5

MR. ESTRADA:

There are two points about the

6

guidelines that I think we have to keep in mind, Justice

7

Ginsburg.

8

especially in the world after Booker, which is the world

9

that confronted Congress in 2010.

The first one is that they are guidelines,

They are guides that

10

must be considered by the judge to inform judicial

11

discretion.

12

is nothing inherent in saying that we must have new ones

13

that also implies a new obligation of statutory law to

14

people whose offense conduct occurred earlier.

15

So, in the nature of the guidelines, there

The second aspect of it is that it has been

16

part of the nature of a guidelines system for two

17

decades that it has been consistent with the decision by

18

Congress in some areas to constrain the exercise of

19

discretion with mandatory minimums.

20

recognized that in multiple occasions, in Kimbrough, in

21

Neal, in DePierre, any number of cases.

22

guidelines themselves in section 5G1 recognize that the

23

mandatory minimum may trump a lower guideline.

24
25

And this Court has

2

et cetera, and you also have a recognition by the

3

Commission itself that they have to integrate this

4

reality of sentencing law into their own guidelines,

5

there is very little basis for an inference that

6

Congress in providing new guidelines would have

7

contemplated that the effective date of the law would

8

change -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Congress did say:

consistency.

Otherwise, the

Justice Ginsburg, I am

prepared to admit for purposes of this case, and I think

it's probably the right answer, that Congress intended

that the guidelines had to line up with the penalties of

So, those people would

5

not have been bound to a mandatory minimum.

6

district courts were not bound to the guidelines anyway,

7

even if there had been no amendment to the guideline,

8

the judges would have known they weren't bound to the

mandatory minimum and probably not bound to guidelines

And since

That's correct on both counts.
So, it would have

That's correct on both counts,

15

but that's -- but that I -- you know, it sort of assumes

16

that the guidelines are systemically irrelevant in all

analysis -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, only in cases like

this, where we know they have to change because Congress

21

has directed they be changed.

22

MR. ESTRADA:

But, look -- I mean, one of

23

the interesting aspects about these cases is that one of

24

the Petitioners, for example, got the benefit of being

25

sentenced at the time that the post-FSA guidelines, the

2

him of 110 to 137.

4

minimum of 10, which is on -- on the lower end of that

5

guideline.

6

That's -- that's Mr. Hill.

These

He was sentenced to a mandatory

The only reason that case is in the U.S.

7

Supreme Court is because, even after the new statute,

8

the judge was of a mind that he wanted to use a

9

one-to-one ratio.

And that's why there's a controversy

10

here.

But the -- that highlights, you know, the point

11

that I'm trying to make and that the Court made in

12

Kimbrough, which is that the mandatory minimums tend to

13

enforce a species of uniformity in a world in which the

14

guidelines are advisory, and they do help uphold, you

15

know, the principle that people that committed

16

comparable offenses will have some rough comparability.

17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that begs the

question -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the problem with this -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- I started with, with

21

you, which is if we know that this new Congress has

22

already determined that those -- that mandatory minimum

23

is discriminatory in the way that it had been

24

constructed, what would be the purpose of delaying

25

implementation?
39

MR. ESTRADA:

If Congress had made that

2

finding, Justice Sotomayor, I would fully expect them,

3

as a citizen, to cut the sentences of everybody who is

4

already serving the sentence irrespective of finality.

5

And the fact that Congress did not do that, which is a

6

proposition on which everybody agrees, I think is

7

powerful evidence that the assumption that this

8

necessarily reflects a conclusion that the previous

9

system was indisputably discriminatory as opposed to

10

arguably discriminatory -­

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would find that

12

extraordinary, that they say it's racist, but we're

13

going to leave in effect all of the sentences that have

14

previously been -- been imposed.

15

unlikely.

16

That seems to me very

Mr. Estrada, I would like you to explain the

17

effect of 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which -- which does seem

18

to -- to be sure, it's not in the new legislation, but

19

it's the background against which the new legislation

20

was adopted, and it seems to require that -- that the

21

court use the guidelines in effect at the time of

22

sentencing.

23

MR. ESTRADA:

Right.

This is a fight about

24

competing background rules.

Section 109 is one of them

25

and it says the old law shall be applied to people who
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

committed their offenses while the old law was in force.

2

It is a directly applicable statute to the situation at

3

hand.

This purported competing background rule is

5

a rule that simply says a judge shall consider the

6

guidelines then extant.

that he gets.

It implies nothing about the duty to

MR. ESTRADA:

41

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree applicable law

2

doesn't help us, because -- all the time, there are two

3

different sets of guidelines that apply depending upon

4

when you committed the crime.

5

right.

That's very common.

All

So, I agree with you that far.

6

But now I'm worried about -- the last

7

question Justice Scalia asked does, I think, focus this

8

question, because we have not only 109; we have also

9

the -- the one we're talking about now, and that says,

10

normally, you will apply the guidelines in effect even

11

to people who committed the crime before the new

12

statute.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

Okay.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And now, do we have any

15

analogies?

16

I can't find out how many people we're talking about.

17

I'd like to know at least are there many other occasions

18

when Congress amended mandatory minimums so there's some

19

precedent?

20

Has this ever happened before?

Is there --

Any?
MR. ESTRADA:

Justice Breyer, this is a

21

staple of what has happened in the lower courts in a

22

routine application of section 109.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. ESTRADA:

25

Yes.

My best example -- and please

do not think I'm pandering -- is a case called
42
Alderson Reporting Company

U.S. v. Smith from the Second Circuit, which -- which

2

was authored by then-Judge Sotomayor.

3

comparable case in which Congress had dropped the

4

severity of a penalty.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. ESTRADA:

7

Yes.

It had to be -- you know, the

penalty that deals with supervised release.

8
9

And it was a

And Congress had gone from a world in which
a violation of supervised release had to be subject to a

10

mandatory sentence, to a world in which the statute had

11

been changed, to say that it was up in the discretion of

12

the judge.

13

had violated his supervised release.

14

which was actually a lot more plausible than this one,

15

was that before he violated, the law had changed, and he

16

was now in effect now coming to the court for a new

17

sentencing.

18

By the time the offender came to court, he
And his argument,

Which is exactly analogous to this.
The Second Circuit had no trouble in saying

19

that a routine application of section 109 killed that

20

claim because the offense was considered completed at

21

the time it was committed; and, therefore, this was a -­

22

a claim that simply was not tenable in light of the

23

language of section 109.

24

case where somebody could have said the law that now

25

applies is the one that applies to my new sentencing

And that, too, is a -- is a

43
Alderson Reporting Company

1

under the new applicable guidelines.

2

Now, I will say another two logical points

3

about, you know, the competing rule that the Government

4

is urging.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Estrada, before you do,

6

if I can understand your argument as it relates to

7

Justice Scalia's questions -- I just want to make sure I

8

understand it.

There's a person who has 4.99 grams of

9

crack cocaine.

And you do not dispute, do you, that

10

that person would be subject to the new guidelines,

11

which are based on the 18-to-1 ratio rather than the

12

100-to-1 ratio?

13

MR. ESTRADA:

I do not.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

And -­
So, you do not

15

dispute that.

16

which the person who has 4.99 grams of cocaine is

17

getting the 18-to-1 ratio, and a person who has 5 grams

18

is getting the 100-to-1 ratio that's embedded in the

19

mandatory minimums.

20

So -- so, then we're living in a world in

MR. ESTRADA:

That is absolutely right, and

21

that was the -- the paradox, if you want to call it

22

that -- that the government brought you in Kimbrough.

23

And the Court accepted that that was the case.

24

yes, this leads to cliffs.

25

straight line in between all of the possible penalties.

It said,

It leads to a lack of a

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We accept all of that.

It is an artifact of the fact

2

that Congress at certain points, but not on a continuous

3

line, has chosen to constrain sentencing discretion with

4

the rough tool of a quantity threshold.

5

It is all set out in the Kimbrough case.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, when Judge Easterbrook

7

talked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted

8

the position that you adopted.

9

there is no earthly reason for this.

10

But he just said, look,
It's just that we

can't find a clear enough statement in the statute.

11

I guess the question I would ask you is:

12

Can you do better than Judge Easterbrook?

13

an earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to

14

create this weird halfway system in which, if you have

15

4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you

16

have 5 grams, another rule applies?

17

MR. ESTRADA:

Can you find

I don't think that that's what

18

he found inexplicable.

19

whole notion of changing it up to a point was more what

20

he's saying.

21

I think the -- you know, the

I can think that Congress has at least the

22

rational reason that the Court ascribed to the system in

23

its post-Booker way at the top of page 108, I think, in

24

the Kimbrough case, where it is that now that we have a

25

system in which so much depends on the discretion of the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

individual sentencer, it is actually salutary to have a

2

few points of confluence that work as an enforced,

3

although rough, uniformity in the sentences of

4

comparably situated offenders.

5

If I go back -­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the Government is

7

arguing and the Petitioner is arguing for a uniform

8

rule, the rule that the time of sentencing controls.

9

MR. ESTRADA:

10
11

Right.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that uniformity doesn't

quite answer it, unless I misunderstood -­

12

MR. ESTRADA:

No, I think that they are

13

competing visions of fairness and of uniformity in this

14

case, Justice Kennedy.

15

the Government to the one they had in the McNeill case

16

last year, because the identical argument was made to

17

them in the -- on the other side, that it was somewhat

18

irrational to apply the better sentence to the person 1

19

day later versus the person 1 day earlier.

20

I am trying to hold, you know,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But Justice Kagan's

21

question concerning what interest is served by your

22

position has particular force when we're talking about

23

the sentencing judge.

24

in the judicial system, one of the hardest things is

25

sentencing.

The hardest thing -- as we know

And you're saying that a sentencing judge
46
Alderson Reporting Company

who knows the law has been changed, who knows the law

3

that it's fair for this -- for this person to be

sentenced to the longer term.

That's a very difficult -­

Now, I would -­
MR. ESTRADA:

If I could take the -- I'm

sorry, Justice Kennedy.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. ESTRADA:

Go ahead.

If I could take, you know, the

13

other side of that argument.

One of the reasons why I

14

think, you know, the Court should accept that Congress

15

contemplated new guidelines but not necessarily take up,

16

you know, the Government's view that this is actually

17

called for by the very end of that section, applicable

18

law, is that the Government looks at this as a world in

19

which Congress has now intervened and in effect

20

compelled a -- a more linear function of sentencing so

21

that, henceforth, I guess the Commission has to conform

22

to the -- to the 18-to-1 ratio, and it would no longer

23

be open to the Commission, for example, to do what it

24

did in 2007, which is we changed our mind; there is a

25

mandatory minimum that constrains us, but in light of
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the most recent scholarship, we think the ratio should

2

be 16 to 1.

3

And -- and one of the reasons why I am

4

reluctant to urge you to accept, you know, the

5

Government's construction, which I can see how they

6

would be helped by in future cases, is that I think it's

7

very implausible for Congress to have considered this,

8

as they say, the centerpiece of the statute and have -­

9

have it be the last depending clause of section 8.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait, wait.

This is -­

just tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe

I'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked.

MR. ESTRADA:

The simple point I was trying

24

to make, Justice Breyer, is that the whole thing that

25

the guideline system now has to conform with applicable
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law, which, you know, the Government reads as the new

2

ratio and could extend to other things, could

potentially disable the Commission from adopting its own

ameliorating amendments that depart from the regime

6

are mandatory minima that are troublesome and give rise

7

to cliffs, there are also occasions in which the

Commission is able to do things that are not consistent

based.

The LSD guideline that was at issue in Neal and the

crack guideline that was not at issue but was discussed

in connection with the statutory interpretation in -- in

5

6

overstate the point.

My point is there is reason to

7

believe that Congress intended the new guidelines to be

8

available for new offenses.

9

emergency authority so that that would be possible makes

The fact that Congress gave

10

perfect sense because in the absence of emergency

11

authority, the new guidelines would not -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You have to -­

13

what you're arguing is not that the guidelines would be

14

available for new offenses.

15

they would be available for everybody except the

16

cliffhangers.

What you're arguing is that

That -- that's what you're arguing.

17

MR. ESTRADA:

Except for?

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Everyone but the

19

cliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out,

20

those people who were subject to the old guideline at a

21

higher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a

22

lower rate.

23

lower amount because they're not bound by the mandatory

24

minimum.

25

And so, they're going to get sentenced to a

MR. ESTRADA:

But there are -- there are two
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

alternative worlds after the FSA, Justice Sotomayor.

In

2

the first one, guidelines don't change for 15 months.

3

People who committed the crime after the FSA come to the

4

court for sentencing 10 months later and they get the

5

new mandatory minimum, but it doesn't matter because the

6

old guidelines are higher.

7

judge would intervene and use Booker discretion, but not

8

necessarily so.

It is possible that the

9

And the alternative world which Congress did

10

give us is you change the guidelines as soon as you can;

11

if you come to the bar of the court with a pre-FSA

12

offense, it doesn't matter, because the new guidelines,

13

like every guidelines book since the beginning, say that

14

if a mandatory minimum applies, that controls over the

15

then-current guidelines, which is one of the fundamental

16

reasons why the alternative view of the world and the

17

alternative rule of construction the Government proffers

18

makes no sense.

19

As a pure statutory construction matter and

20

for those members of the Court who give weight to

21

legislative history, I will point out that the emergency

22

authority section that the Government thinks is

23

dispositive on this point was in every version of this

24

bill -- Senate 1711, Senate 1383, you know, the House

25

versions that they cite -- even when those statutes, as
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Scalia pointed -- I'm sorry -- as Justice Alito

2

pointed out earlier, provided an effective date for the

3

new statute of 6 months hence.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is -­

Well, along those lines,

5

could I -- could I ask you this question, which is

6

intended to explore the -- the issue whether the

7

argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency

8

with applicable law doesn't assume the answer that is -­

9

that one attempts to get from it?

10

Suppose the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said

11

expressly this applies only -- the new mandatory

12

minimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also

13

contained a provision that says the Sentencing

14

Commission has to bring the guidelines into consistency

15

with applicable law.

16

have to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply

17

only to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair

18

Sentencing Act would trump this previous provision in

19

the Sentencing Reform Act.

20

I assume there what they would

MR. ESTRADA:

Wouldn't that be correct?
Correct.

And I think that

21

that would be true here as well.

And the reason why I

22

was highlighting the earlier bills is because each and

23

every one of them had the same, almost word for word,

24

"conform with applicable law" emergency authority.

25

of them uniformly said the new mandatory minimums will
54
Alderson Reporting Company

All

Official

1
2

not apply for another 6 months after the enactment.
As a logical proposition, if Congress

3

thought that the identical language made sense to bring

4

the guidelines into conformity with a law that would not

5

take into -- that would not kick in for another 6

6

months, having it kick in sooner does not have any more

7

logical import in saying that, therefore, you know, the

8

guidelines now mean that previous offenses get a

9

different sentence.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But could I understand what

11

you're saying, Mr. Estrada?

12

right, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing

13

Commission has in fact promulgated should not be being

14

applied right now to those who committed crimes before

15

the enactment date.

16

on the ground, is it?

17

Because if Justice Alito is

And that's not what's happening now

MR. ESTRADA:

Justice Kagan, it is not

18

happening in that manner because the guidelines, every

19

book of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is

20

the first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these

21

are the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory

22

minimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and

23

that becomes the mandatory sentence.

24
25

And so, there has never been any reason to
have two sets of guidelines to account for cliffs or
55

1

mandatory minimums, because every guidelines book has

2

had a built-in solution to that problem, which is we

3

understand that there are cliffs, we understand that

4

there is a world of mandatory minimums; we can't fix

5

those, this is our guideline sentence.

6

some reason -- because it occurred, you know, before or

7

whatever -- there is a mandatory minimum that applies,

8

the guidelines say the mandatory minimum becomes the

9

guideline sentence.

10

If somehow, for

So, in that sense, a Congress that knew the

11

law would understand that saying you have to have new

12

guidelines had no logical force in saying that,

13

therefore, the effective date of mandatory minimums or

14

any other factor that bore on the application of

15

mandatory minimums would be changed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. EBERHARDT:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Obviously, this Court recognizes the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

difficulty of those district court judges sitting and

2

asking themselves:

3

opposed to another defendant?

4

colleague, Mr. Estrada, I still have to ask the Court to

5

consider the question that the Court has been asking:

6

What possible reason could Congress have to want a

7

district court judge to have to sit back, 5 years after

8

the date of enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, and

9

impose mandatory minimums that everyone agrees at this

10

What do I do with this defendant as
And after listening to my

point are racially discriminatory?

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, you could say

12

that about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section

13

109.

14

we have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty

15

should be lesser, even though we've decided, when we do

16

that, you continue to apply the bad old penalty to

17

people who committed a crime before the amendment.

18

Isn't that what 109 says?

19

I mean, that's what section 109 says:

MR. EBERHARDT:

Even though

It can be, but, as Justice

20

Sotomayor recognizes, there has never been a situation

21

such as this basically in the history of criminal law

22

and criminal law sentencing in our country.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'd imagine you'd find

24

disagreement with that.

You know -- you know -- you

25

know if -- as a matter of fact, in the year that these
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

took effect, think of the sentences that were not

2

governed by mandatory for crack, not governed by the

3

mandatory minimum.

4

call it a low sentence, disproportionately low?

5
6

MR. EBERHARDT:

Congress ultimately felt

that they did, yes, because what they -­

7
8

Did the guidelines provide, let's

JUSTICE BREYER:

And did they change those

non-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?

9

MR. EBERHARDT:

The guidelines changed in

10

different respects with regard to different amounts.

The new -­

JUSTICE BREYER:
up.

All right.

I'll look it

I'll look it up.
MR. EBERHARDT:

I suggest the Court -- we

15

admit that 109 has to be considered in the case, but I

16

think to find what was really meant by Congress, after

17

the Court looks to section 109, the Court does have to

18

look to the 3553 sentence -- or 3553 section, that makes

19

it very plainly clear, ever since the Sentencing Reform

20

Act, that the date of sentencing clearly is the

21

important date, as opposed to the date of the commission

22

of the crime.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All those arguments

24

have nothing to do with the provision about the

25

Sentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of that, right?

2

Your argument is what rational reason could

3

Congress have had to -- given the urgency of the

4

problem, the seriousness, why wouldn't they have wanted

5

the provisions to apply as you urged they should?

6

MR. EBERHARDT:

But it goes hand-in-hand

7

with the mandate from the Sentencing Commission to put

8

the new guidelines in place as soon as practical, as

9

well as provisions of section 10.

10

Thank you very much.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Thank you,

Mr. Eberhardt.

13

Mr. Estrada, at the invitation of the Court,

14

you have briefed and argued this case as an amicus

15

curiae in support of the judgment below.

16

discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is

17

grateful.

You've ably

18

The case is submitted.

20

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
