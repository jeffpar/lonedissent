ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. BARTELS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear case

MR. BARTELS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Arizona, almost all State and Federal

10
11

claims for relief from a criminal conviction are

12

raisable in the Arizona Court of Appeals on direct

13

appeal.

14

However, a claim that trial counsel was

15

ineffective must be presented first to a trial court in

16

what Arizona labels a postconviction relief proceeding.

17

Petitioner agrees entirely with Arizona's

18

requirement that ineffective assistance of trial counsel

19

claims go initially to a trial court, and he does not

20

object to the label "postconviction relief" as such.

21

The issue in the case has to do with

22

Arizona's insistence that Petitioner had no right to

23

counsel with respect to the postconviction first-tier

24

review, portion of first-tier review, even though he did

25

have a right to counsel in the appeal portion of direct
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

review.

2

And our position is that that distinction

3

between what are two portions of the first opportunity

4

for review of a conviction, broken up sensibly but by

5

the dictate of the State into two parts, that that

6

distinction cannot stand, especially in a case in which

7

the first postconviction proceeding started and ended

8

before anything of substance --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
MR. BARTELS:

10
11

But if you --

-- happened in the direct

appeal.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If your main position is

13

right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings?

14

I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the

15

claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by

16

a trial judge first, not an appellate judge.

17

2255 proceedings, if you're urging ineffective

18

assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right

19

to counsel.

20

appointed only if the court determines that the

21

interests of justice so require.

22

you're urging would have ramifications in the Federal

23

system as well, wouldn't it?

And yet in

In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be

24

MR. BARTELS:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, the proposition

That's correct, Your Honor.
And so, 2255 would no

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

longer be the interests of justice so require because if

2

it's your first opportunity to raise the point, the

3

court must appoint counsel for you.

4

MR. BARTELS:

That's your view?

In a situation -- the Federal

5

system is a little more complicated than Arizona, though

6

not much, because of Massaro.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. BARTELS:

9

Because of the what?

Our position would be, in the

Federal system, if -- if a Federal defendant wished to

10

file a 2255, that he would be entitled to appointed

11

counsel but, as far as this case is concerned, only with

12

respect to any claim of ineffective assistance of trial

13

counsel.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you want us to hold that

15

there is a right to counsel whenever a petitioner

16

asserts a claim that could not have been asserted at an

17

earlier point in the proceedings?

18

MR. BARTELS:

Yes, Your Honor, with the

19

caveat:

If the State allows that kind of proceeding.

20

One of the things I have a hard time keeping track of in

21

this context is, unlike the right to counsel at trial,

22

the Sixth Amendment right, where I think they have to

23

give him a trial, we're dealing in a context where this

24

Court made clear well over 100 years ago that there

25

doesn't have to be any review at all.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

The State --

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's a very far-reaching

2

proposition that extends well beyond claims of

3

ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it?

4

MR. BARTELS:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
If many years after someone

6

is convicted an allegation is made that the prosecution

7

failed to turn over exculpatory evidence and that the

8

information supporting the claim has just recently come

9

to light and could not have been previously discovered,

10

there would be a right to counsel there.

11

MR. BARTELS:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. BARTELS:

If the State -That would be the case?
If the State provided that

14

proceeding, that -- and the State would not have to.

15

The State could have statutes of limitation or rules

16

against successive petitions that could be extremely

17

strict if they're concerned about that.

18
19
20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would it be

successive if it could not have been raised earlier?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, as I understand

21

the situation, we've got newly discovered evidence of

22

perhaps a Brady violation.

23

State provides a proceeding for review of that, and it

24

is the first opportunity for review, I think the

25

implication of Douglas and Halbert is there would be a

In that situation, if the

but the Federal government does?

5

straight to Federal habeas?

11

They can't -- they can't

Right?

MR. BARTELS:

Well, but the Federal system

12

itself has a statute of limitation, though I believe

13

that the statute would probably begin to run, in Justice

14

Alito's hypothetical, with the discovery of a Brady

15

violation.

16

statute of limitation to accommodate that claim.

17

the States would be free to do that, too, if they

18

wished.

19

And so, the Federal courts have set up the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

If -- if you are

20

permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not

21

have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel

22

limited to that point, or can the counsel representing

23

the client bring up other things?

24
25

MR. BARTELS:

No, Your Honor.

The right to

counsel would apply only to the first-tier review issue.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

And so, for example, if counsel finds other issues and

2

wants to pursue them, the State could say:

3

going to pay you for those.

We're not

counsel could also bring up a Brady claim, newly

MR. BARTELS:

The holding in this case will

be so limited, but I would agree that Douglas and

Halbert would imply that Brady would -- at least many

Brady claims would be such that the 2255 or the State

related to other claims that petitioner wants to raise

postconviction proceeding not only that counsel was

23

ineffective at trial but also that all of these other

24

claims are meritorious.

25

Counsel

Are you saying that the counsel that -- to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making

2

only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and

3

cannot go on and represent the petitioner on these other

4

claims?

5

MR. BARTELS:

I'm saying, Your Honor, that

6

the State does not have any duty to pay the lawyer in

7

those circumstances.

8
9

Now, the kind of situation you're talking
about I think is most likely to come up where -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

It's not a question of

11

pay.

I've got a duty to represent my client zealously.

13

want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of

14

counsel but these other matters.
MR. BARTELS:

15

So, I

Your Honor, I think the

16

appointment could be limited to the first-tier review

17

issues.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

I don't

21

didn't raise a Batson claim.

the Batson claim once he establishes ineffectiveness --

23

MR. BARTELS:

The claim is,

Surely, he gets to pursue

Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact,

in that example, pursuing the ineffective assistance

25

claim requires pursuing the Batson claim.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so, the

2

lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel

3

not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness

4

argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to

5

which he was ineffective.

6

MR. BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, in the

7

situation in which the ineffectiveness of counsel is

8

based on the failure to make a Batson claim, the failure

9

to make an objection at trial, I would agree with you,

10

absolutely.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How does this work now,

3

counsel?

How are you proposing this work?

Right now,

4

in the Federal system, a pro se litigant comes in and

5

says, I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

6

Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an

7

affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the

8

claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a

9

hearing.

Under your theory, every State would be

10

obligated to appoint counsel ab initio to check out

11

whether there is the potential for an IAC claim?

12

MR. BARTELS:

Well, I think the States could

13

run this in different ways.

14

does it makes sense to me, which is that the -- there is

15

a form, Form 24(b).

16

doesn't require stating any substantive grounds.

17

really just says, I would like to challenge my

18

conviction through postconviction relief, in the very

19

same way that notices of appeal.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, what you are

21

essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint

22

an attorney on the first leg?

MR. BARTELS:

Every State is obligated to

24

treat these, what are really parts of the appeal, the

25

initial appeal, in the same way they do the rest of
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the appeal.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, there is a huge

3

reliance interest that has developed since Finley and

4

its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint

5

postconviction counsel.

6

MR. BARTELS:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Your Honor -What are we going to do

about that reliance interest and the burdens on States?

9

MR. BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess

10

I would say two things about that.

11

fair number of States that do appoint counsel routinely

12

upon request.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. BARTELS:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

One, there are a

Well, I know --

Arizona is one.
I know for a fact that

16

most do in capital cases.

17

the same figure for non-capital cases.

MR. BARTELS:

But I don't know if that's

I don't know the percentage,

Your Honor, but I know there are several States.

I don't understand.

And -Could

21

you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor

22

asked?

have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the

11

first lawyer that they gave him on collateral review was

12

ineffective?

MR. BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, that is not

the issue in this case.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. BARTELS:

What is the issue?

The issue in this case is

17

whether the ineffectiveness of the first postconviction

18

counsel --

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. BARTELS:

21
22

Yes.

-- constitutes cause to

excuse -JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, why --

23

that's what I thought, actually.

And I don't understand

24

what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing

25

something, about whether they're all going to have to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appoint lawyers or not in these different States.

2

seems to me that has nothing to do with this case.

3

It

This case comes out of a State that does

4

appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your

5

client, should have from your point of view at least one

6

full, effective chance to say:

7

appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible.

8

And -- or whether the State can block that from being

9

heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and

Every lawyer I have been

10

the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even

11

raise.

That's the issue; is that it?
MR. BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, we're

13

actually, once we take it past two, I -- I'm not on

14

board with the hypothetical.

No, no, no.

But I'm not --

I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim.

I'm saying

maybe that's right.

18

claim, probably.

19

in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102

20

proceedings and every one of them was absolutely

21

ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it

22

and say, oh, I see, he's claiming he's never had one

23

full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was

24

ineffective because the other 19 were just as bad.

Sorry.

No, Your Honor.
Okay.

That's not my argument.
Now let's start at ground

Everyone else --

(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO:

Why isn't that where your

11

argument leads, to the proposition that you can never

12

procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective

13

assistance of counsel claim?

14

MR. BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, on a

15

theoretical level, I don't think this Court's decisions

16

in Douglas and Ross and Halbert give us a clear answer

17

about whether there's a right to effective assistance of

18

second postconviction counsel.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we want to know what

20

rule you're advocating in this case.

21

MR. BARTELS:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -We want to know why you're

23

not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito

24

indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous

25

counsel were ineffective.

You say, oh, no, you're not
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arguing that.

What is the rule that you are arguing

2

for?

3

not have an endless right of counsel?

4

MR. BARTELS:

What limiting principle do you have so that we do

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

5

theory that you get counsel for first-tier review limits

6

it to that first tier, because when you go after the

7

effectiveness of this -- of the first postconviction

8

counsel, that is necessarily going to involve review of

9

the effectiveness of trial counsel -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

But -- I understand that.

11

But what is it that prevents the Petitioner from saying

12

that the first counsel in the collateral proceeding was

13

ineffective and that so was the second?

14

MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I don't think

15

there's a right to a counsel and therefore not a right

16

to effective counsel in the second --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you can -- you can have

18

a -- you don't have to give him a counsel.

19

State did give him a counsel on first collateral review;

20

that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise

21

the claim my trial counsel was no good.

22

Now we go to the next round.

Look, the

The State

23

says:

I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we're not

24

giving you a lawyer anymore.

25

now has to know he has to make the argument himself.

Okay.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

That may count.

He

And, therefore, he goes and makes the argument himself,

2

and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all

3

wrong.

He's not blocked.

4

MR. BARTELS:

That's correct.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, what --

6

there isn't an issue in this case about giving people

7

counsel, on that view.

8

do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have

9

an argument later that you did it ineffectively.

There is an issue about if you

That's

10

a different matter; that's a question of whether you're

11

blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim.

12
13

All right, forget it.

Yes, okay.
But there can't be a

this argument with the -- with the judgment that you've

21

offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings

22

there must be --

true in Arizona.

In Arizona, the

And the other thing that would have to be

done -- and this is done in some States -- is that you

15

have to raise it in direct appeal, but most -- as this

17

assistance claims can't be dealt with on direct appeal

because of a lack of evidence.

assistance of appellate counsel certainly can't be dealt

the obligation to provide counsel to contest the

15

constitutionality of the representation that was

16

provided on appeal?

17

MR. BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

18

reason is that -- in terms of this first-tier,

19

second-tier analysis from Douglas and Halbert, you're

20

not going to be able to look at the effectiveness of

appellate counsel without looking at the issue of

would be because Douglas and Halbert have done that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT E. CATTANI

Thank you.
Mr. Cattani.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

Thank you, counsel.

MR. CATTANI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

I would like to focus on three points.

10

First, Petitioner is advocating a significant change to

11

this Court's jurisprudence that does implicate the

12

State's reliance interest on Finley and Giarratano.

13

It's not a modest change --

Mr. Cattani, could I ask
Because your State is one

I'm just wondering -- in your brief, you talk a

And I'm just wondering where those costs come from

MR. CATTANI:

And I know some other

I think they come primarily

24

from the logical extension of the rule that would

25

require a second postconviction proceeding to litigate
26
Alderson Reporting Company

1

claims of ineffective assistance of first postconviction

2

counsel.

3

under Finley and Giarratano because there's no --

4

there's no constitutional right to counsel.

5

under the theory and -- I don't think there's really

6

been advanced a principled basis for limiting the rule

7

that's been advanced.

Right now, those claims are routinely rejected

8

Under --

And, certainly, under --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if we just said there

9

is -- you know, we can only draw a line in this context,

10

and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where

11

it sticks.

12

What are the additional costs to you?
MR. CATTANI:

Well, the additional costs

13

would -- would be implicated with a second

14

postconviction proceeding.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Well, that -- it's only

16

a cost if that second counsel, however it's secured, can

17

actually make a credible or sustainable claim that

18

appellate counsel, the first-tier counsel, was

19

ineffective.

20

MR. CATTANI:

Well, I think it's the nature

21

of ineffective assistance claims.

They are easy to

22

raise and difficult to litigate.

23

difficult to raise -- to assert ineffective assistance.

24

It's -- it's very obvious in the context of capital

25

cases where -- where an assertion is my attorney was

them routinely on papers, and most of them are denied.

some evidence that she wanted to raise an issue that the

victim's diary would have contained some exculpatory

11

information.

12

would have had to have been developed in a

20

What conceivable strategic

MR. CATTANI:

Well, if she thought that

there would be a claim but, after looking at it further,

22

decided that the claims were not colorable, is, I think,

23

what happened in this instance.

Is it routine, or

issue that can only be raised on collateral review to

2

think that it makes sense to raise that right away so

3

that the appeal -- and then the appeal is delayed until

4

that's resolved?

5

MR. CATTANI:

It is what happened in Arizona

6

frequently, prior to the Spreitz decision.

And,

7

historically, counsel was allowed -- counsel were

8

allowed to raise claims of ineffective assistance and

9

stay the appeal.

And that was the practice previously.

10

So, it's not necessarily unusual that an attorney

11

reviewing the record might decide that there's some

12

issue that could be raised in postconviction.

13

All right.

14

not -- we'll say this is my argument.

he was adequate at trial.

does.

Is that right?

MR. CATTANI:

Well, I -- I think it's better

viewed through the lens of procedural due process.

available to a defendant to raise a claim of ineffective

Just follow the questions.

20

The question is, if he tries to make the claim he does,

21

want to say that my first lawyer was no good at trial,

22

and my second lawyer, who by coincidence was the same in

23

the collateral proceeding, was no good either, then the

24

State comes in and says:

say this, that every defendant has to have one fair shot

25

at claiming -- they can make the claim that his trial

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, why not

Official

1

2

give him a lawyer at collateral review, but if it does,

3

then that lawyer, he can say, couldn't make that claim

4

because he was inadequate.

5

make that argument in habeas.

6

But somebody might.

7

And the State doesn't have to

So, you say, fine, they can
I bet they never win it.

He can make it.

So, what would happen would be that the

8

habeas judge in Federal habeas would read the piece of

9

paper.

10

He'd say, what's the ground for thinking this?

And then he'd make his normal kinds of judgments.

11

Now, what is -- is there anything wrong with

12

that view?

13

seems to me it would relieve the concerns of the States

14

about worrying about having to appoint a lot of lawyers,

15

and it gives him a fair shot to make his argument.

MR. CATTANI:

That's correct, but if you

don't, then the problem is you shift over to Federal

18

court, and on Federal habeas you're then -- you're then

19

in the position of litigating claims that are untethered

20

to any State court decision.

21

whether it's blocked by current precedent, certainly

22

under Edwards v. Carpenter to allege ineffective

23

assistance as cause to overcome a procedural default,

24

there's a requirement that you litigate that claim in

25

State court.

And when we talk about

35
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

The question is whether

2

there's cause external to the petitioner to overcome the

3

procedural default.

4

would the petitioner representing himself or herself,

5

not have to show that, I would have raised a claim of

6

ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and I would

7

have won on that, were it not for the fact that the

8

State appointed counsel for me and led me astray and

9

prevented me from raising this meritorious argument --

10
11

So, if you went down that road,

isn't that where that would have to go?
MR. CATTANI:

Well, I think it would, but

12

it's even more problematic here in that the procedure is

13

that the attorney files a notice, gives notice to the

14

defendant that she's been unable to find any colorable

15

claims and gives the defendant an opportunity to file

16

his own pleading.

17

to think that if we just grant a second postconviction

18

proceeding that the defendant is going to be in any

19

better position than he's in, in this type of situation

20

where he's advised that the attorney says, as is

21

routinely the case, I'm unable to find colorable claims,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Cattani, if you handled

this through the regular appeals process, the person

16

would receive the benefit of counsel.

Rather than shuttle this over to the postconviction

18

review process?

19

MR. CATTANI:

Is that correct?

Well, the person -- here he

20

receives the benefit of counsel because it's appointed

21

22

your question is, would he be entitled to the effective

23

assistance of the attorney developing that record --

He receives the benefit of counsel.

MR. CATTANI:

5

6

defendant to be entitled to relief on a claim that could

7

be raised on direct appeal.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -Well, Massaro, indeed, said

that there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue

and putting it in a different kind of process.

suppose the State does this, and some States do it:

12

MR. CATTANI:

Well, I think more important

2

than the -- than the label that's been put on it is the

nature of the -- of the argument that's being advanced,

and it's a collateral attack, whether it -- whether a

What

So, now you're creating a

You're saying anything which somebody

10

determines is appropriately raised as a collateral

11

attack, even if there's been no first review of that

12

question, there's no entitlement to counsel?

13

MR. CATTANI:

Well, I think that's the

14

logical extension of what this Court announced in Finley

15

v. -- Finley and Giarratano, that we've drawn this

16

distinction between --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't think, as

18

Justice Kennedy said, that we ever really considered

19

that question in Finley and Giarratano because we were

20

assuming there that all the things had been through the

21

appeals process.

22

MR. CATTANI:

But I guess I'm not certain

23

that the timing would make a difference of when -- of

24

whether you had a direct appeal first or whether the

25

collateral proceeding occurs first.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

In either case, the

Official

1

collateral proceeding is a non-record-based attack on

2

the conviction, as opposed to the direct review, which

3

is a record-based review of the conviction.

4

timing I don't think is as important as the nature of

5

what's happening; it's a non-record based attack on the

6

conviction.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, the

Well, Justice Kagan's

8

question indicates that there are States, as you know,

9

where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary

10

hearing on IAC.

And as I understand your answer, is if

11

that happens, the proceedings that precede the

12

resolution of the issue on direct appeal, being probably

13

conducted by the same counsel who is taking the direct

14

appeal, can be conducted and he can be -- and the

15

counsel, he or she, can be inadequate in the conduct of

16

those further inquiries.

17

MR. CATTANI:

That seems to me very strange.
Well, I don't think we're

18

suggesting that would be the desired outcome.

19

simply that drawing the distinction between

there's no constitutional right to effective assistance

24

supplementary proceedings.

25

MR. CATTANI:

That's very strange.
Well, I guess the suggestion

is that it's a collateral -- that's a collateral

2

proceeding.

3

go back and address ineffective assistance, that that

would essentially be a collateral proceeding.

If they -- if you stay the proceeding and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You mean -- it makes no

sense to me.

That happens quite frequently on direct

7

appeal where a variety of issues are raised, and the

8

court -- the circuit courts or the appellate courts send

9

it back to trial counsel to develop the record further.

10

Your position is every time there's a sending back, that

11

stops the need for effective counsel?

If they've sent something back

It's --

it's relevant is that if you were to say that there

I would have asked you, what is the difference between

2

this case and that case?

3

relevant to this case, because the difference is really

4

just one of just labels.

5

MR. CATTANI:

So, that's the reason it's

Well, and that's why I think

6

it's more important to -- to assess the inquiry that's

7

being done, whether it's a collateral inquiry, as

8

opposed to whether we're labeling it part of the -- the

9

direct appeal or not.

And if it is a collateral

10

inquiry, then it makes more sense, I think, to -- to

11

couch it in terms of this is collateral review.

12

certainly, I think --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But,

There seems to be a

14

rational line between collateral attack and attack in

about that.

I don't see anything irrational

the Federal Government provide counsel in a first

13

We live in a world that is

Although this Court has drawn the

discretion of the trial court or the public defender.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Forty-seven do and the

Federal Government does?
MR. WALL:

That's right.

So, there are 18

14

States that provide it as of right; 29 States and D.C.

15

provide it in the discretion of the trial court or the

16

public defender, and then the Federal Government,

17

obviously, in the discretion of the district courts.

18

And so, what Petitioner is doing, by

19

constitutionalizing that area, is shifting resources to

20

a subset of ineffectiveness claims.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's pretty --

22

it's small comfort to the lawyer -- the client who

23

doesn't get one that everybody else does.

24
25

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, I understand,

but I think this is an area where States are permitted

Alderson Reporting Company

to draw different lines.

2

-- take the Federal system, for example.

3

rule would say a Federal prisoner can walk in under

4

2255, and by making an allegation of ineffectiveness of

5

either trial or appellate counsel, he's entitled to

6

appointed counsel without even, I take it, a showing of

7

colorableness.

8
9

And what Petitioner is saying

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Petitioner's

Well, not if you adopt the

-- the one-proceeding rule that I think counsel for the

10

Petitioner was suggesting.

11

of those few States where you could only raise this

12

issue on collateral, and, therefore, you are entitled to

13

effective assistance of counsel on that collateral.

14

Then he would stop there, for statistical and for --

15

reasons, probability reasons, rather.

16

MR. WALL:

He suggested Arizona is one

I think that's exactly where he

17

would stop.

18

his rule doesn't require him to go further, because by

19

saying the first tier is not a stage of a case, as this

20

Court has always meant it, but it applies claim by

21

claim, and lawyers are going to represent you only on

22

some claims, and you're -- pro se you'll file others, he

23

ends up with two problems.

24
25

I think it's very difficult to explain why

One, he has to concede, as he does in his
reply brief and as he did in response to Justice Alito,
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that he's going to say the same thing with regard to a

2

lot of other claims that are typically raised in habeas;

3

and, second, he can't find a limiting principle.

4

Because when you come in on your second or your third or

5

your fourth postconviction proceeding, and you say all

6

my previous counsel has been ineffective, that's also

7

the first time that you've been able to say it, and

8

you'll be making the same claim:

9

one constitutionally competent lawyer argue that my

I'm entitled to have

trial counsel was ineffective.

JUSTICE BREYER:

his client can in fact assert that that single

19

individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those

20

proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the

21

termination of the appeal, ended first.

In this case, it was the

In this case, the proceeding was filed

So, for this case, this

22

MR. WALL:

Here's -- here's the primary

23

problem with that, Justice Breyer:

24

Coleman, and before that in Murray v. Carrier and in

25

Wainwright v. Torna, that if you don't have a Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

This Court said in

2

Congress go beyond what they're constitutionally

3

required to do when they give you a lawyer, that

4

lawyer's performance does not thereby give rise to a due

5

process claim.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but it didn't face the

7

issue of what about a claim that you have a

8

constitutional right to bring up at least once?

9

this is the first time he was able to bring it up.

And
So

10

in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem.

It's

11

as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was

12

sleeping until you got to collateral proceedings.

13

State could have such a rule.

14

would, but they could.

15

your first chance ever to attack that trial process, and

16

so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation,

17

actually rather beside the point?

because he was staring at the ceiling and had been

drinking too much.

9

could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time

Just as he could raise that point in

10

that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of

11

trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera.

12

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer, I think this case

13

presents a much narrower question, which is, when he

14

comes in, in his second postconviction proceeding, and

15

says although I didn't raise it last time around, I have

16

cause to excuse that default because my lawyer was

17

ineffective, this Court's been clear in three different

18

cases that that's only cause if he had a constitutional

19

right to counsel in the proceeding that he's pointed to

20

and that he complains about.

21

So, the question --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you haven't told me

22

is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel

23

in the first postconviction proceeding?

24

entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the

fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged

direct appeal.

3

likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal

because they would have a record from below; they would

have competent counsel below who would make the best

6

arguments possible.

7

discretionary appeals because they had something to work

8

with.

9

Discretionary appeal, we said the

They could then pursue their

But if your first chance as to present

10

ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a

11

postconviction proceeding, you have no record to work

12

with.

13

MR. WALL:

That's right.

Justice Sotomayor,

14

I think this is a very different case from Douglas and

15

Halbert, which were grounded in a fairly fundamental

16

equal protection concern, that indigent defendants would

17

be denied a first look, maybe an only look, at their

18

convictions and sentences.

19

Here, we're facing something very different.

20

States like Arizona are giving direct appeals;

21

defendants are getting looks at their convictions and

22

sentences, as Petitioner did.

23

MR. WALL:

They're even providing lawyers in

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- only look at the

4

effective assistance claims.

5

Mr. Wall, if a State did the following:

6

we're going to take out all Fourth Amendment exclusion

7

claims, and we're going to put that in a postconviction

8

review system, and, you know what, there you're not

9

entitled to an effective lawyer -- would that be all

10

So, what would you say,
If it said

right?

11

MR. WALL:

Justice Kagan, I think there are

12

any number of claims that if a State tried to pull them

13

out of direct appeal and locate them in collateral

14

review, we might be able to say it's end-running its

15

obligation under Douglas, because those are the types of

16

claims based on a trial record that ought to be -- and

17

always have belonged to direct appeal.

18

does a State act arbitrarily when it takes an

19

ineffectiveness claim, which is the only type of claim

20

that a State has tried to relocate into collateral

21

review --

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The question is,

Well, I'm sure the State

23

would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example.

24

The State would say there's a good reason for it:

25

Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored; they
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind

2

of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a

3

different proceeding.

4

So, I think that the State would have many

5

good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there

6

you don't get a lawyer.

7

MR. WALL:

Justice Kagan, I just -- I think

8

that the Court's case law would -- I mean, I think it

9

would be a difficult question, the Court having said

10

that under Stone, at least in the Federal system, the

11

Fourth Amendment -- Fourth Amendment claims can't be

12

raised on habeas.

13

State to come in and say they have to be raised in

14

habeas.

15

I think it would be difficult for a

Here, the Court said in Massaro these claims

16

are best suited to resolution in habeas, and they're

17

claims that are traditionally brought in habeas.

18

least for that type of claim, which is the -- I mean,

19

the State's not trying to hide the ball here.

20

State has done is take a claim that this Court has said

21

belongs at habeas and say we're putting it in habeas,

22

not as in the Federal system where, although people can

23

raise it as a practical matter, they're all decided on

24

collateral review, or virtually all of them.

25

we're just going to save people the trouble of briefing

and raising it, and we'll locate it to collateral

2

review, not for an invidious or arbitrary reason, but

3

for all the reasons that this Court gave in Massaro.

4

So, at least for that type of claim, I think

5

it's permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, leaving

6

for another day whether it could do it with other types

7

of claims that I do think probably belong to a direct

8

appeal.

statutes a right to effective assistance of counsel.

counsel, that counsel's performance thereby gives rise

to a due process claim.
