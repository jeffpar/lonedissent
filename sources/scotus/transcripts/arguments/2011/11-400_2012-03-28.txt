ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The constitutionality of the Act's massive

12

expansion of Medicaid depends on the answer to two

13

related questions.

14

And, second, does that coercion matter?

15

First, is the expansion coercive?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, can I ask you

16

a -- just a matter of clarification?

17

making the same argument if, instead of the Federal

18

Government picking up 90 percent of the cost, the

19

Federal Government picked up 100 percent of the cost?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Would you be

Justice Kagan, if everything

21

else in the statute remained the same, I would be making

22

the exact same argument.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The exact same argument.

24

So -- so, that really reduces to the question of why is

25

a big gift from the Federal Government a matter of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

coercion?

2

here saying we're giving you a boatload of money.

3

are no -- there's no matching funds requirement, there

4

are no extraneous conditions attached to it, it's just a

5

boatload of Federal money for you to take and spend on

6

poor people's healthcare.

7

me, I have to tell you.
MR. CLEMENT:

8
9

In other words, the Federal Government is
There

It doesn't sound coercive to

Well, Justice Kagan, let me --

I mean, I eventually want to make the point where, even

10

if you had a standalone program that just gave

11

100 percent, just 100 percent boatload, nothing but boatload --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14

Yes, I mean, if you -Why, there would still be a

problem.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

Yes, you do make that argument

16

in your brief, just a standalone program, a boatload of

17

money, no extraneous conditions, no matching funds, is

18

coercive?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

It is.

But before I make that

20

point, can I simply say that you built into your

21

question the idea that there are no -- no conditions.

22

And, of course, when you first asked, it was what about

23

the same program with 100 percent matching on the newly

24

eligible mandatory individuals, which is how the statute

25

refers to them.

And that would have a very big

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

condition.

And the very big condition is that the

2

States, in order to get that new money, they would have

3

to agree not only to the new conditions, but the

4

government here is -- the Congress is leveraging their

5

entire prior participation --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

hypothetical, Mr. Clement.

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let me give you a

Now, suppose I'm an

10

employer, and I see somebody I really like, and I want

11

to hire that person.

13

says, well, I -- you know, I've never been offered

14

anywhere approaching $10 million a year.

15

going to say yes to that.

16
17

Of course, I'm

coercive, right?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I guess I'd want to know

where the money came from --

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

And the person

Now, we would both be agreed that that's not

18
19

And I say I'm going to give you

from --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm offering you $10 million a year to come

Wow.

Wow.

work for me, and you're saying that this is anything but
5
Alderson Reporting Company

a great choice?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

If I told you,

3

actually, it came from my own bank account.

4

what's really going on here, in part --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MR. CLEMENT:

7

But, Mr. Clement --

-- and that's why it's not

simply a matter of saying --

8
9

Ah.

And that's

JUSTICE KAGAN:
possibly be?

Mr. Clement, can that

When a taxpayer pays taxes to the Federal

10

Government, the person is acting as a citizen of the

11

United States.

12

a person is acting as a citizen of New York.

13

York could no more tell the Federal Government what to

14

do with the Federal Government's money than the Federal

15

Government can tell New York what to do with the monies

16

that New York is collecting.

17

When a taxpayer pays taxes to New York,

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

And New

And if New York and

18

the United States figured out a way to tax individuals

19

at greater than 100 percent of their income, then maybe

20

you could just say it's two separate sovereigns, two

separate taxes.

22

world, that to the extent the Federal Government

23

continues to increase taxes, that decreases the ability

24

of the States to tax their own citizenry, and it's a

25

real tradeoff.

But, we all know that in the real

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is that a limit on the

Federal Government's power to tax?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

What's that?

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you suggesting that

5

at a certain point, the States would have a claim

6

against the Federal Government raising their taxes

7

because somehow, the States will feel coerced to lower

8

their tax rate?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm

10

not.

11

case that you can say, well, it's free money, so we

12

don't even have to ask whether the program's coercive.

13

What I'm suggesting is that it's not simply the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, counsel, what

14

percentage does it become coercive?

15

at the figures I've seen from amici, there are some

16

States for whom the percentage of Medicaid funding to

17

their budget is close to 40 percent, but there are

18

others that are less than 10 percent.

19

Meaning, as I look

And you say, across the board this is

20

coercive because no State, even at 10 percent, can give

21

it up.

22

the Federal Government can give?

23

you're saying to me is, for a bankrupt State, there's no

24

gift the Federal Government could give them ever,

25

because it can only give them money without

What -- what's the percentage of big gift that
And -- because what

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- no matter how poorly

4

the State is run, no matter how much the Federal

5

Government doesn't want to subsidize abortions or

6

doesn't want to subsidize some other State obligation,

7

the Federal Government can't give them 100 percent of

8

their needs.
MR. CLEMENT:

9

And -- and Justice Sotomayor,

10

I'm really saying the opposite, which is not that every

11

gift is coercive, no matter what the amount, no matter

12

how small.

13

is there has to be some limit.

14

limit on coercion.

15

I'm saying essentially the opposite, which
There has to be some

And the reason is quite simple, because this

16

Court's entire spending power jurisprudence is premised

17

on the notion that spending power is different, and that

18

Congress can do things pursuant to the spending power

19

that it can't do pursuant to its other enumerated powers

20

precisely because the programs are voluntary.

21

you relax that assumption that the programs are

22

voluntary, and you're saying they're coercion, then you

23

can't have the spending power jurisprudence that’s different.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if

So, what makes them

coercive; that the State doesn't want to face its voters

1

and say, instead of taking 10, 20, 30, 40 percent of the

2

government's offer of our budget and paying for it

3

ourselves and giving up money for some other function?

4

That's what makes it coercive --

5

MR. CLEMENT:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

-- that the State is

unwilling to say that?

8
9

Well, it's --

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, maybe -- maybe I can

talk about what makes it coercive by talking about the

10

actual statute at issue here and focusing on what I

11

think are the three hallmarks of this statute that make

12

it uniquely coercive.

13

One of them is the fact that this statute is

14

tied to the decidedly nonvoluntary individual mandate.

15

And that makes this unique, but it makes it significant,

16

I think.

17
18
19

I'll continue.
question.

I thought you had a

I'm sorry.
The second factor, of course, is the fact

20

that Congress here made a distinct and conscious

21

decision to tie the State's willingness to accept these

22

new funds, not just to the new funds, but to their

23

entire participation in the statute, even though the

24

coverage for these newly eligible individuals is

25

segregated from the rest of the program.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

And this is

Official

1

section 2001(a)(3).

2

the blue brief.

3

It's at page 23A of the appendix to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that true of every

4

Medicaid increase, that each time -- I mean, and this

5

started quite many years ago, and Congress has added

6

more people and given more benefits -- and every time,

7

the condition is, if you want the Medicaid program, this

8

is the program.

9

Take it or leave it.

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Ginsburg, this is

10

distinct in two different directions.

11

of the prior expansions of the program, but not all,

12

Congress has made covering newly eligible individuals

13

totally voluntary.

14

newly eligible individuals, they'll get additional

15

money; but if they don't, they don't risk any of their

16

existing participation programs.

One is, in some

20

It

There were other expansions that have taken

21

place, such as the 1984 expansions, where they didn't

22

give States that option.

23

dimension in which this is distinct, which is here,

24

Congress has created a separate part of the program for

25

the newly eligible mandatory individuals.

But here's the second

10
Alderson Reporting Company

That's what

1

they called them.

2

And those individuals are treated separately

3

from the rest of the program going forward forever.

4

They are going to be reimbursed at a different rate from

5

everybody who was covered under the preexisting program.

6

Now, in light of that separation by Congress

7

itself of the newly eligible individuals from the rest

8

of the program, it's very hard to understand Congress's

9

decision to say, look, if you don't want to cover these

10

newly eligible individuals, you don't just not get the

11

new money, you don't get any of the money under the --

Exactly.
And the cite I have is

42 U.S.C. Section 1396(c).

7

So are we talking about the same thing?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

I -- if that's the -- if that

is the provision that gives the Secretary --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14
15
16

Yes.

Okay.

-- among other things -And here's what it says at

the end.
MR. CLEMENT:

-- the authority to cut off

participation in the program, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It says, "The Secretary

17

shall notify the State agency" -- this is if they don't

18

comply -- "that further payments will not be made to the

19

State, or in his discretion, that payments will be

20

limited to categories under or parts of the State plan

21

not affected by such failure, which it repeats until the

22

Secretary is satisfied that he shall limit payments to

23

categories under or parts of the State plan not affected

24

by such failure."

25

So reading that in your favor, I read that
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to say it's up to the Secretary whether, should a State

2

refuse to fund the new people, the Secretary will cut

3

off funding for the new people, as it's obvious the

4

State doesn't want it, and whether the Secretary can go

5

further.

6

case where the Secretary ever did go further, but I also

7

would think that the Secretary could not go further

8

where going further would be an unreasonable thing to

9

do -- since government action is governed by the

I also should think -- I could not find one

10

Administrative Procedure Act, since it's governed by the

11

general principle, it must always be reasonable.

12

So I want to know where this idea came from

13

that should State X say I don't want the new money, that

14

the Secretary would or could cut off the old money?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

And Justice Breyer, here's

16

where it comes from, which is from the very beginning of

17

this litigation, we've pointed out that what's coercive

18

is not the absolute guarantee that the Secretary could

19

cut off every penny, but the fact that she could.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, let me

21

relieve you of that concern, and tell me how I --

22

whether I have -- that a basic principle of

23

administrative law -- indeed, all law -- is that the

24

government must act reasonably.

25

And should a Secretary

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

justified by being causally related to the State's

2

refusal to take the new money, you would march into

3

court with your clients and say, Judge, the Secretary

4

here is acting unreasonably.

5

implicit in this statute, as there is explicit in the

6

ADA, that any such cutoff decision must be reasonable.

And I believe there is

7

Now, does that relieve you of your fear?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

Justice --

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

(Laughter.)

13

MR. CLEMENT:

15
16
17

I didn't think it would,

but I --

12

14

It doesn't for this reason,

Well, but here's the reason.

Here's the reason -- Justice Breyer, it doesn't.
One is -- I mean, I don't know the opinion
to cite for that proposition.
Second is, I've been -- we've been making in

18

this litigation since the very beginning this basic

19

point, the government has had opportunities at every

20

level of this system, and I suppose they'll have an

21

opportunity today to say:

22

don't want to take the new conditions, all you will lose

23

is the new money.

24
25

Fear not, States.

If you

And when we --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I said -- I said

because it could be, you know, given the complexity of
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Act, that there is some money that would be saved in

2

the program if the States take the new money, and if

3

they don't take the new money, there is money that is

4

being spent that wouldn't otherwise be spent.

5

could be some pile like that.

6

There

It might be that the Secretary could show it

7

was reasonable to take that money away from the States,

8

too --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Clement --

10

-- but my point is, you

11

have to show reasonableness before you can act.

you agree that the government has to act reasonably?

mean -JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Executive has to act

20

reasonably, that's certain, in implementing a statute;

21

but if the statute says, in so many words, that the

22

Secretary can strike the whole -- funding for the whole

23

program, that's the law, unreasonable or not, isn't it?

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but I have a

number -- all right.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

And if I could just add one

4

thing just to the discussion, is the point that, you

5

know, this is not all hypothetical.

6

was a record in the district court, and there is an

7

Exhibit 33 to our motion for summary judgment.

not -- it's not in the joint appendix.

10

I mean, in -- there

We can lodge it

But it's a letter that's in the record in

11

this litigation, and it's a letter from the Secretary to

12

Arizona, when Arizona floated the idea that it would

13

like to withdraw from the CHIP program, which is a

14

relatively small part of the whole program.

15

And what Arizona was told by the Secretary

16

is that if you withdraw from the CHIP program, you risk

17

losing $7.8 billion, the entirety of your Medicaid

18

participation.

So, this is not something that we've

sure that the Court's federalism jurisprudence should

14

force States to depend on how a lower court reads Holly

15

to accomplish.

And, States, you can take the new plan, you can leave

3

them.

4

20 percent more, depending on what Congress chooses.

We're going to give out 20 percent less, maybe

5

Can Congress do that?

Does it have to

6

continue the old system because that is what the States

7

are relying upon, and it's coercive now to give them a

8

new system?

limited the right of government not to spend money in

5

the ways that it thinks appropriate?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

7

before -- I mean, I'll try to answer that question, too.

8

But the first part of the question was, you know, what

9

if the Congress just tried to scrap this and start over

10
11

again with a new program?
Here's why this is fundamentally different

12

and why it's fundamentally more coercive, because

13

Congress is not saying we want to scrap this program.

14

They don't have a single complaint, really, with the way

15

that States are providing services to the visually

16

impaired and the disabled under pre-existing Medicaid.

17

And that's why it's particularly questionable why

18

they're saying that if you don't take our new money,

19

subject to the new conditions, we're going to take all

20

of the money you've previously gotten that you've been

21

dependent on for 45 years, and you're using right now to

serve the visually impaired and the disabled --

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right,

Justice Ginsburg.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we're also told that

4

there are other States that like this expansion, and

5

they are very glad to have it.

6

The relief that you're seeking is to say the

7

whole expansion is no good, never mind that there are

8

States that say we don't feel coerced, we think this is

9

good.

10

You are -- you're saying that because you

11

represent a sizeable number of States, you can destroy

12

this whole program, even though there may be as many

13

States that want it, that don't feel coerced, that

14

say -- think this is a good thing?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, that's

16

right, but that shouldn't be a terrible concern, because

17

if Congress wants to do what it did in 1972 and pass a

18

statute that makes the expansion voluntary, every State

19

that thinks that this is a great deal can sign up.

20

What's telling here, though, is 26 States

21

who think that this is a bad deal for them actually are

22

also saying that they have no choice but to take this

23

because they can't afford to have their entire

24

participation in this 45-year-old program wiped out, and

25

they have to go back to square one and figure out how

they're going to deal with the visually impaired in

Is that possible?

Is

There's a correlation,

Justice Scalia.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

Yes.

Let -- let me ask you

14

another thing, Mr. -- Mr. Clement.

Most colleges and

15

universities are heavily dependent on the government to

16

fund their research programs and other things, and

17

that's been going on for a long time.

18

passes, and a government official comes around and

19

say -- says to these colleges, if you want money for

20

your physics labs and all the other things you get it

21

for, then you have to create an athletic program for

22

girls.

23

there's no way in the world I can give up all the funds

24

to run all these labs that we have.

25

so I'm being coerced to accept this program that I don't

And then Title IX

And the recipient says I am being coerced,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

I can't give it up,

Official

1

want.

2

Why doesn't your theory -- if your theory is

3

any good, why doesn't it work anytime something --

4

someone receives something that's too good to give up?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

6

there's two reasons that might be different.

One is,

7

this whole line of coercion only applies -- is only

8

relevant, really, when Congress tries to do something

9

through the spending power it couldn't do directly.

10

So if Congress tried to impose Title IX

11

directly, I guess the question for this Court would be

12

whether or not Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment

13

allowed Congress to do that.

14

that it did, and I imagine some of your colleagues might

15

take issue with that, but that's -- that's the nature of

16

the question.

17

I imagine you might think

So, one way around that would be, if

18

Congress can do it directly, you don't even have to ask

19

whether there's something special about the spending

20

power.

21

FAIR case about funding to -- to colleges.

22

That's how this Court resolved, for example, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where on your -- I'm

23

trying to understand your coercion theory.

24

there are cases of ours that have said there's a line

25

between pressure and coercion, but we have never had, in
23
Alderson Reporting Company

I know that

Official

1

the history of this country or the Court, any Federal

2

program struck down because it was so good that it

3

becomes coercive to be in it.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, if --

5

I'm going -- to say the second thing about my answer to

6

your prior question, which is just that I also think

7

that, you know, it may be that spending on certain

8

private universities is something, again, that Congress

9

can do, and it doesn't matter whether it's coercion.

10

But when they're trying to get the States to expand

11

their Medicaid programs, that's something --

12
13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's take -- let's take

public colleges.
MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

Then there -- then

15

there may be some limits on that.

16

I'm not sure, even in that context, there might not be

17

some things Congress can do.

18

I mean -- but again,

It's a separate question.

But once we take the premise, which I don't

19

think there's a disagreement here, that Congress could

20

not simply, as a matter of direct legislation under the

21

commerce power or something, say, States, you must

22

expand your Medicaid programs.

23

given, then I think we have to ask the question of

24

whether or not it's coercive.

25

If we take that as a

Now, you -- in -- in your second question,
24
Alderson Reporting Company

you asked, well, you know, I mean, where's the case that

says that we've crossed that line?

case, I would respectfully say --

All those prior extensions, to

10

governed by precisely the same statute that you're

11

complaining of here, which has been in the law since

12

'65.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, I don't think

14

that our position here would necessarily extend to say

15

the 1984 amendments, and let me tell you why.

16

I'm -- I'm not saying that absolutely that's guaranteed

17

that's not coercive, but here's reasons why they're

18

different.

19

The one major difference is the size of the

20

program.

21

is really breathtaking.

22

Federal spending to the States was a shade over

23

$21 billion.

24

before the expansion under this statute.

25

You know,

I mean, the expansion of Medicaid since 1984
Medicaid, circa 1984, the

Right now, it's $250 billion, and that's

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if you are right,

25

1

Mr. Clement, doesn't that mean that Medicaid is

2

unconstitutional now?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Not necessarily,

4

Justice Kagan.

5

with a one trick pony.

6

factors -- we point you to three factors that make this

7

statute uniquely coercive.

8

size of this program.

9

And, again, it's because we're not here
And this -- one of the

One of them is the sheer

And, you know, if you want a -- if you want

10

a gauge on the size of this program, the best place to

11

look is the government's own number.

12

of their brief.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

15

number.

16
17

So, when does a program

That's -- that is --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought $1 trillion -I'll tell you this number,

20

which I did look up, that the amount, approximately, if

21

you look into it -- as a percentage of GDP, it's big,

22

but it was before this somewhere about 2-point-something

23

percent, fairly low, of GDP.

24

little bit over 3 percent of GDP.

25

the comparable numbers, which I did look at, with the

It'll go up to something a

26
Alderson Reporting Company

And now go look at

Official

1

expansion that we're talking about before.

2

The expansion from 0 to 18 or even from 0 to

3

6.

And while you can argue those numbers, it's pretty

4

hard to argue that they aren't roughly comparable as a

5

percentage of the prior program or as a percentage of

6

GDP.

7

If I'm right on those numbers or even

8

roughly right -- I don't guarantee them -- then would

9

you have to say, well, indeed, Medicaid has been

10

unconstitutional since 1964.

11

And if not, why not?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

The answer is no, and that's

13

because we're here saying there are three things that

14

make this statute unique.

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:
third?

What are your second and

I'm on pins and needles to hear your second --

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. CLEMENT:

19

Well, one is the sheer size.

Yes, exactly.
Two is the

20

fact that this statute uniquely is tied to an individual

21

mandate which is decidedly nonvoluntary.

22

the fact that they've leveraged the prior participation

23

in the program, notwithstanding that they've broken this

24

out as a separately segregated fund going forward, which

25

is not to prove -27
Alderson Reporting Company

And three is

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, on the third -- on the

2

third, suppose you have the current program and Congress

3

wakes up tomorrow and says we think that there's too

4

much fraud and abuse in the program, and we're going to

5

put some new conditions on how the States use this money

6

so we can prevent fraud and abuse, and we're going to

7

tie it to everything that's been there initially.

8

Unconstitutional?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I think that is

10

constitutional because I think that's something that

11

Congress could do directly.

12

that to the spending program.

13

is -- is a statute -- you know, it may -- it's in the

14

criminal code.

15

that's -- that's a provision that I don't think its

16

constitutionality's called into question.

17

It wouldn't have to limit
And I think 18 U.S.C. 666

It may be tied to spending, but I think

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't get the

18

idea.

19

restrictions in Medicaid, and Congress can legislate

20

coverage expansions in Medicaid.

21

I mean, Congress can legislate fraud and abuse

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, I think

22

there's a difference, but if I'm wrong about that and

23

the consequence is that Congress has to break Medicaid

24

down into remotely manageable pieces as opposed to

25

$3.3 trillion over 10 years before the expansion, I
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't think that would be the end of the world.

2

really would ask you to focus on specifically what's

3

going on here, which is they take these newly eligible

4

people -- and that's a massive change in the way the

5

program works.

6

But I

These are people who are healthy, childless

7

adults who are not covered in many States.

They say,

8

okay, we're going to make you cover those.

We're going

9

to have a separate program for how you get reimbursed

10

for that.

You get reimbursed differently from all the

11

previously eligible individuals.

in the program for the visually impaired and the

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I guess my greatest

20

fear, Mr. Clement, with your argument is the following:

21

The bigger the problem, the more resources it needs.

22

We're going to tie the hands of the Federal Government

23

in choosing how to structure a cooperative relationship

24

with the States.

25

Government, the bigger the problem, the less your powers

We're going to say to the Federal

2

structure the program the way you want.

3

Federal Government.

4

program ourself to protect all our interests.

It's our money,

We're going to have to run the

5

I don't see where to draw that line.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, if you -The uninsured are a

8

problem for States only because they, too, politically,

9

just like the Federal Government, can't let the poor

10

die.

11

it's because they feel accountable to their citizenry.

12

And so, if they want to do it their way, they have to

13

spend the money to do it their way, if they don't want

14

to do it the Federal way.

15

And so, to the extent they don't want to do that,

So, I -- I just don't understand the logic

16

of saying, States, you can't -- you don't -- you're not

17

entitled to our money, but once you start taking it, the

18

more you take, the more power you have.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, a

20

couple of points.

One is, I actually think that sort of

21

misdescribes what happened with Medicaid.

22

States were, as you suggest, providing for the poor and

23

the visually impaired and the disabled even before

24

Medicaid came along.

25

the Federal Government said, look, we'd like to help you

I mean,

Then all of a sudden, States --

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with that, and we're going to give you money

2

voluntarily.

3

with more conditions.

4

to totally expand the program, and they say that you

5

have to give up even your prior program, where we --

6

first came in and offered you cooperation, we're now

7

going to say you have to give that up if you don't take

8

our new conditions.

9

And then over time, they give more money
And now they decide they're going

Secondarily, I do think that our principle

10

is not that when you get past a certain level, it

11

automatically becomes coercive per se.

12

when you get a program and you're basically telling

13

States that, look, we're going to take away

14

$3.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that at that

15

point, it's okay to insist that Congress be a little

16

more careful that it not be so aggressively coercive as

17

it was in this statute.

18

But I do think

And I would simply say that -- we're not

19

here to tell you that this is going to be an area where

20

it's going to be very easy to draw the line.

21

telling you that it's exceptionally important to draw

22

that line, and this is a case where it ought to be easy

23

to establish a beachhead, say that coercion matters, say

24

there's three factors of this particular statute that

25

make it as obviously coercive as any piece of
31
Alderson Reporting Company

We're just

Official

1

legislation that you've ever seen, and then you will

2

have effectively instructed Congress that there are

3

limits, and you will have laid down some administrable

4

rules.

20

money, of course you can't turn it down, or is it the

21

amount that's going to be taken away if you don't take

22

what they're offering?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

It's both, Your Honor.

Is it

And I

24

think that that's -- I mean, there really is -- there

25

really is, you know, three strings in this bow.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official

1

one is the sheer amount of money here makes it very,

2

very difficult to refuse, because it's not money that,

3

you know, that's come from some -- you know, China or

4

from -- you know, the – the – the export tariffs like in

5

the old day.

6

that's part of it.

It's coming from the taxpayers.

So,

7

The fact that they're being asked to give up

8

their continuing participation in a program that they've

9

been participating in for 45 years as a condition to

10

accept the new program, we think that's the second thing

11

that's critical --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why isn't that

13

a consequence of how willing they have been since the

14

New Deal to take the Federal Government's money?

15

seems to me that they have compromised their status as

16

independent sovereigns because they are so dependent on

17

what the Federal Government has done, they should not be

18

surprised that the Federal Government, having attached

19

the -- they tied the strings, they shouldn't be

20

surprised if the Federal Government isn't going to start

21

pulling them.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

And it

With all due respect,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think we can say that, you

24

know, the States have gotten pretty dependent, so let's

25

call this whole federalism thing off.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

And I just think

Official

1

it's too important, because, again, the consequence --

2

if you think about it -- if -- the consequence of saying

3

that we're not going to police the coercion line here

4

shouldn't be that well, you know, it's just too hard, so

5

we'll give the Federal Congress unlimited spending

6

power.

7

The consequence ought to be, if you really

8

can't police this line, then you should go back and

9

reconsider your cases that say that Congress can spend

10

money on things that it can't do directly.

11

Now, we're not asking you to go that far.

nature of things that I do think the amount of the

I mean, but it's in the

So,

10

it's not just free money that they are turning down if

11

they want to; it really is --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, if we go back

13

to that era of matching what a State pays to what a

14

State gets, Florida loses.

15

less than what they get back in Federal subsidies of all

16

kinds.

17

Florida can't ask for more than it gives, because it's

18

really giving less than it receives.

MR. CLEMENT:

MR. CLEMENT:

But it's not -- it's not what
37

Alderson Reporting Company

1

my argument depends on, and that's the critical thing.

2

It's one aspect of what makes this statute uniquely

3

coercive.

4

And I really think if you ask the question,

5

what explains the idea that if you don't take this new

6

money, you're going to lose all your money under what

7

you have been doing for 45 years to help out the

8

visually impaired and the disabled?

9

wants the States to stop doing that.

Nobody in Congress
They're just doing

10

it, and it's purely coercive, to condition the money.

11

It's leverage, pure and simple.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the inevitable

13

consequence of your position was that the Federal

14

Government could just do this on its own, the Federal

15

Government could have Medicaid, Medicare, and these

16

insurance regulations -- assuming that's true -- then

17

how are the interests of federalism concerned?

18

the interests of federalism concerned if, in Florida or

Texas or some of the other objecting States, there are

20

huge Federal bureaucracies doing what this bill allows

the State bureaucracies to do?

I'd just

like your answer.
MR. CLEMENT:

I have, and I would like to

elaborate, but the one-word answer is "accountability."
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

If the Federal Government decides to spend

2

money through Federal instrumentalities, and the citizen

3

is hacked off about it, they can bring a Federal

4

complaint to a Federal official working in a Federal

5

agency.

6

And what makes this so pernicious is that

7

the Federal Government knows that the citizenry is not

8

going to take lightly the idea that there are huge, new

9

Federal bureaucracies popping up across the country.

10

And so, they get the benefit of administering this

11

program through State officials, but then it makes it

12

very confusing for the citizen who doesn't like this.

13

Do they complain to the State official because it's

14

being administered by a State official in a State

15

building?

Or do they --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. CLEMENT:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Clement --- or do they --- that is very confusing,

19

because the idea behind cooperative Federal/State

20

programs was exactly a federalism idea.

21

the States the ability to administer those programs.

22

was to give the States a great deal of flexibility in

23

running those programs.

Justice Kagan.

Cooperative federalism is a beautiful

5

thing.

Mandatory federalism has very little to

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

Cooperative federalism --- the kind of

accountability --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- does not mean that there

11

are no Federal mandates and no Federal restrictions

12

involved in a program that uses 90 percent here,

13

100 percent Federal money.

14

built into the program subject to certain rules that the

15

Federal Government has about how it wishes its money to

16

be used.

17

It means there's flexibility

It's like giving a gift certificate.

If I

18

give you a gift certificate for one store, you can't use

19

it for other stores.

20

kinds of different things.

21

But still, you can use it for all

MR. CLEMENT:

But -- I absolutely agree that

22

if it's cooperative federalism and the States have

23

choices, then that is perfectly okay.

24

that's why voluntariness in coercion is so important.

25

Because if you force a State to participate in a Federal
40
Alderson Reporting Company

But when --

Official

1

program, then -- I mean, as long as it's voluntary, then

2

a State official shouldn't complain if a citizen

3

complains to the State about the way the State's

4

administering a Federal program that it volunteered to

5

participate in.

6

then it's not fair to tell the citizen to complain to

7

the State official, they had no choice.

8
9

But at the point it becomes coercive,

But who do they complain to at the Federal
level?

There's nobody there, which would be -- I'm not

10

saying it's the best solution to have Federal

11

instrumentalities in every State, but it actually is

12

better than what you get when you have mandatory

federalism, and you lose the accountability that is

14

central to the federalism provisions in the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion

24

provisions will provide millions of Americans with the

25

opportunity to have access to essential health care that
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

they cannot now afford.

It is an exercise of the

2

Spending Clause power that complies with all of the

3

limits set forth in this Court's decision in Dole, and

the States do not contend otherwise.

asking this Court to do something unprecedented, which

is to declare this an impermissibly coercive exercise

of power.

13

through the Spending Clause?

14

we were -- give -- give us a hypothetical.

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

What -- what do you think

Yes.

First, if I could

16

just try to be a little more precise about it,

17

Justice Scalia, I think the -- what the Court said in

18

Steward Machine and in Dole is that it's possible that

19

you might envision a situation in which there's

20

coercion.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

23
24
25

Okay.
And the courts didn't say

much more, but I can think of something.
One example I could think of that might
serve as a limit would be a Coyle-type situation, in
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

which the condition attached was a -- worked a

2

fundamental transformation in the structure of State

3

government in a situation in which the State didn't have

4

a choice but to accept it.

5
6

But -- and so --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But anything else, so long

as you --

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- you have to have --

you're talking about situations where they have to
locate their statehouse in some other city --

Well, but I think --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Or a unicameral

legislature, or something like that.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

But short of that, they can make the State do anything

15

at all?

a germaneness issue, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's not

4

what we --

But there's no

coercion question at all?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, but I think -- I think -- I think

I think that the germaneness inquiry

10

in Dole really gets at coercion in some circumstances,

11

and that's why I think they are related.

12

have that here.

But we don't

13

And if I could, I would like to address --

And I -- I would like to, if I could, take up

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I know

8

it's -- I know it's different here.

I'm just trying to

9

understand if you accept the fact or regard it as true

10

that there is a coercion limit, or that once the Federal

11

Government -- once you're taking Federal Government

12

money, the Federal Government money -- can take it back,

13

and that doesn't affect the voluntariness of your

14

choice?

Because it does seem like a serious problem.

16

We're assuming, under the Spending Clause the Federal

Government cannot do this.

18

cannot do this.

Under the Constitution it

don't agree to this you lose all your money, whether

22

that's really saying the -- the limitation in the

Constitution is -- is largely meaningless.

24
25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, but I -- but I

don't think that this is a case that presents that

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I know.

I'm

3

just -- I know this -- I don't know if I'll grant it to

4

you or not, but let's assume it's not this case.

5
6

Do you recognize any limitation on that
concern?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think the Court

8

has said, in Steward Machine and Dole, that this is

9

something that needs to be considered in an appropriate

10

case, and we acknowledge that.

dependent on the circumstances that it's very hard to

say in the abstract with respect to a particular program

14

to take that completely off your shoulders.

15

going to impose a special Federal education tax which

16

will raise exactly the same amount of money as all of

the States now spend on education, and then we are going

to give you a grant that is equal to what you spent on

3

all, as a practical matter, there's a pretty serious

4

political constraint on that situation ever arising,

have an easy time of raising the kinds of tax revenues

that need to be -- needed to raised to work that kind of

fundamental transformation, and that's real.

to a situation like that one, Justice Scalia, the -- the

States have their education system, and they can decide

that the Federal Government has offered to the States

States were given the choice to stay in the entire

children under 6 years of age, under 133 percent of

poverty, same thing.

But starting in

11

same thing.

12

The States have one view

In fact, every major expansion,

And so, I just think the history of the

program, and particularly when you read that in context

14

of 42 U.S.C. 1304, which reserves the right of the

15

Federal Government to amend the program going forward,

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

If we could go to the

14

situation we have here, Mr. Chief Justice, this -- with

15

respect to the Medicaid expansion, the States' argument

is, as they've said it in their briefs, they

articulated a little bit different this morning -- this

not what you stand to gain, but what you stand to lose.

that argument in this context is fully 60 percent of

But I do think with respect to the -- the

7

first of their three arguments for coercion, the sheer

8

size argument, that it's very difficult to see how that

9

is going to work, because if the question is about what

10

you stand to lose rather than what you stand to gain,

11

then it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether the

12

Medicaid expansion is substantial or whether it's

13

modest, or whether there's any expansion at all.

14

States, for example -- the Federal Government, for

15

example, could decide that under the -- under the

16

current system, too much money has ended up flowing to

17

nursing home care and that money would be better serving

18

the general welfare if it were directed at infants and

19

children.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just before you leave that,

13

I'd appreciate it if you would expand a little bit on

14

the answer to Justice Kagan's question for the reason,

15

when I read the cutoff statute, which as I said has been

16

there since 1965 unchanged, it does refer to the

17

Secretary's discretion to keep the funding, insofar as

18

the funding has no relationship to the failure to comply

19

with the condition.

20

And as I read that, that gives the Secretary

21

the authority to cut off all the money that the States'

22

refusal to accept the condition means they shouldn't

23

have.

24

and cut off unrelated money.

25

says maybe they could do that.

misconception, and I'd like to be able to take a minute

4

and walk through and explain why that is.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General Verrilli, before you

6

do that, I'm sorry, but in response to the

7

Chief Justice's question, I mean, "the money or your

8

life" has consequence because we're worried that that

9

person is actually going to shoot.

So, I think that

10

this question about are -- what do we think the

11

Secretary is going to do is an important one.

12

And as I understand it, I mean, when the

13

Secretary withdraws funds, what the Secretary is doing

14

is withdrawing funds from poor people's health care, and

15

that the Secretary is reluctant and loath to take money

16

away from poor people's health care and that that's why

17

these things are always worked out.

18

Secretary really doesn't want to use this power, and so

19

the Secretary sits down with the State and figures out a

20

way for the Secretary not to use the power.

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's another way of

2

trying to say what I was trying to say to Justice Scalia

3

earlier, is that the States and the Federal Government

4

share a common objective here, which is to get health

5

care to the needy.

6

instances, they work together to make that happen.

7

And, in the vast majority of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but the

8

question is not -- obviously, the States are interested

9

in the same objective, and they have a disagreement, or

10

they have budget realities that they have to deal with.

11

And States say, well, we're going to cut by 10 percent

12

what we reimburse this for or that for, and the Federal

13

Government says, well, you can't.

14

And no one is suggesting that people want to

15

cut health care, but they have different views about how

16

to implement policy in this area.

17

And the concern is that the Secretary has

18

the total and complete say because the Secretary has the

19

authority under this provision to say you lose

20

everything.

21

that will happen, but so long as the Federal Government

22

has that power, it seems to be a significant intrusion

23

on the sovereign interests of the State.

What I'm -- what I'm

7

that that -- and that's not --

If I could go back to the

sheer size idea, there are, I think, another couple of

19

points that are important in thinking about whether

20

that's a principle courts could ever apply.

21

Once you get into that business -- in

22

addition to the problem I identified earlier, that it

23

basically means that Congress has frozen in place now,

24

based on the size of the program, you've got this

25

additional issue of having to make a judgment about in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose one test could

5

be -- I just don't see that it would be very workable --

6

is whether or not it's so big that accountability is

lost, that it is not clear to the citizen that the State

GENERAL VERRILLI:

You know, here, the

coercion test, as it's been discussed, I think, for

10

example, in Justice O'Connor's dissent in Dole and in

11

some of the other literature, does address federalism

12

concerns in the sense of the Federal Government using

13

Federal funding in one area to try to get States to act

14

in an area where the Federal Government may not have

15

Article I authority.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.
But, as Your Honor

18

suggested earlier, this is a situation in which, while

19

it is certainly true that the Federal Government

20

couldn't require the States, as the Chief Justice

indicated, to carry out this program, the Federal

22

Government could, as Your Honor suggested, expand

side would like it to, in that I think their argument is

15

that it would subject us to such a high degree of

16

political accountability at the State level to withdraw

17

ourselves from the program, that it's an unpalatable

18

choice for us, and that's where the coercive effect

19

comes from.

And that's why I think coercion -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I disagree, Justice Scalia.

That's just an

2

assumption, and if it proves to be wrong, then Congress

3

has time to recalibrate.

4

I just want to go back to the -- the other part of Your

5

Honor's point -- that with respect to the relationship

6

between Medicaid and the -- and the Act and particularly

7

the minimum coverage provision, my friend Mr. Clement

8

has suggested that you can infer coercion because, with

9

respect to the population to which the provision

And beyond that, I do think --

10

applies, if there's no Medicaid, there's no other way

11

for them to satisfy the requirement.

12
13
14

I want to work through that for a minute, if
I may, because it's just incorrect.
First of all, with respect to anybody at

15

100 percent of the poverty line or above, there is an

16

alternative in the statute.

17

credits and with subsidies to insurance companies.

18

with respect to that, the part of the population at

19

100 percent of poverty to 133 percent of poverty, the --

20

the statute actually has an alternative for them.

21

It's the exchanges with tax
So,

For people below 100 percent of poverty, it

is true that there is no insurance alternative.

It's -- it's a result of choices that States

frozen in, per our earlier discussion, to a large extent.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, no, to a much more

18

modest extent was my point, Justice Kennedy.

For

19

example, optional services where a huge amount of money

20

is spent -- more than $100 billion annually -- the

21

largest component of that is nursing home services.

22

That remains optional.

remains in place, States have the flexibility to reduce

that -- those numbers.

It's -- right now, once the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

States have considerable flexibility now and

2

going forward with respect to the way that money is

3

spent.

4

this expansion should be considered coercive, it’s got

5

to be evaluated against the backdrop of the fact that

6

the States are generally -- are generally taking

7

advantage of the opportunities of this statute to

8

greatly expand the amount of money that the Federal

Government spends and the amount of money that they

And I do think in terms of evaluating whether

I think it's very --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, they have to do

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- on the administrative

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Obviously, the

Federal Government isn't bound to that.

And what if,

9

after the 90 percent, they say, well, now -- from now

10

on, for the States -- we're going to pay 70 percent?

11

What happens then?

Where does that extra money come from?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

12

Well, I think -- then --

13

then the States would have a choice at that -- at that

14

point whether they were going to stay in the program or

15

not.

16

But that isn't what we have here, and -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's no -- they

discretion.

I'm also not saying it

So -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the Secretary

14

has the discretion.

15

We're talking about fiscal realities and whether or not

16

the Federal Government is going to say we need to lower

17

our contribution to Medicaid and leave it up to the

18

States because we want the people to be mad at the

GENERAL VERRILLI:

22

Mr. Chief Justice, whether this Medicaid expansion

23

occurred or not.

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but you've

been emphasizing that the Federal Government is going to

77
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pay 90 percent of this, 90 percent of this.

2

not something you can take to the bank, because the next

3

day or the next fiscal year, they can decide we're going

4

to pay a lot less, and you, States, are still on the

5

hook, because you don't -- you say it's not an easy

choice.

7

You're not going to be able to bail out of Medicaid.

8

You just have to pay more because we're going to pay

less.

We can say -- ask whether it's coercion.

Well, like I said, I -- I

agree that it would be a difficult choice in some

think it would depend on what the circumstances were on

16

would ever answer the question of whether it was

17

to --

-- go back to that

23

think he said it's coercion if no one can be politically

accountable.

I'm not sure how that could be practically

78

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's the

-- in their capacity as

20

citizens of the State.

And I think that's why I get --

21

try to get back to the point, that's why I think this is

22

wrong to think about this as coercion, because this is a

23

program that works effectively for the citizens of the

24

State, and States' governments -- and State governments

25

think that, and that's why it has expanded the way it

79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has expanded, because it's providing an essential

2

service for millions of needy citizens in these States.

3

It's providing access to health care that they would not

4

otherwise have.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

You mentioned the --

6

the Dole case.

7

raise your drinking age to 21 or what?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

9

Or lose a percentage of

your highway funds.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

Now, what was the threat in that case,

Do you remember the

percentage?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Seven percent, yes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

It's a pretty

14

small amount.

That's really apples and oranges when

15

you're talking about lose all of your Medicaid funds or

16

lose -- I thought it was 5, but 7 -- 7 percent of your

17

highway funds.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

18

It's -- I think -- I

19

agree with Your Honor that it -- that it's different,

20

21

matter.

which the -- if the States -- is it -- I'm not saying it

I'd like to take half a step back here.

81
Alderson Reporting Company

That this

Official

1

provision, the Medicaid expansion that we're talking

2

about this afternoon and the provisions we talked about

3

yesterday, we've been talking about them in terms of

4

their effect as measures that solve problems, problems

5

in the economic marketplace, that have resulted in

6

millions of people not having health care because they

7

can't afford insurance.

8
9

There is an important connection, a profound
connection, between that problem and liberty.

And I do

10

think it's important that we not lose sight of that.

11

That in this population of Medicaid eligible people who

12

will receive health care that they cannot now afford

13

under this Medicaid expansion, there will be millions of

14

people with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart

15

disease, and as a result of the health care that they

16

will get, they will be unshackled from the disabilities

17

that those diseases put on them and have the opportunity

18

to enjoy the blessings of liberty.

19

And the same thing will be true for -- for a

20

husband whose wife is diagnosed with breast cancer and

21

who won't face the prospect of being forced into

22

bankruptcy to try to get care for his wife and face the

23

risk of having to raise his children alone.

24

multiply example after example after example.

25

And I could

In a very fundamental way, this Medicaid

82
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expansion, as well as the provisions we discussed

2

yesterday, secure of the blessings of liberty.

3

think that that is important as the Court is considering

4

these issues that that be kept in mind.

5

Congress struggled with the issue of how to deal with

6

this profound problem of 40 million people without

7

health care for many years, and it made a judgment, and

8

its judgment is one that is, I think, in conformity with

9

what lots of experts’ thought, was the best complex of

10
11

And I

The -- the

options to handle this problem.
Maybe they were right; maybe they weren't.

12

But this is something about which the people of the

13

United States can deliberate and they can vote, and if

14

they think it needs to be changed, they can change it.

15

And I would suggest to the Court, with profound respect

16

for the Court's obligation to ensure that the Federal

17

Government remains a government of enumerated powers,

18

that this is not a case in any of its aspects that calls

19

that into question.

20

that democratically accountable branches of this

21

government made by their best lights.

22

That this was a judgment of policy

And I would urge this Court to respect that

23

judgment and ask that the Affordable Care Act, in its

24

entirety, be upheld.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT:

4
5

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
Just a few points in rebuttal.

6

First of all

7

we've talked a lot about the sort of hallmark of

8

coercion, your money or your life, with somebody with a

9

gun.

I would respectfully suggest that it is equally

10

coercive and certainly not uncoercive if I say your

11

money or your life -- and by the way, I have discretion

12

as to whether or not I will shoot the gun.

13

think that eliminates the coercion.

I don't

I also don't think this is a discretion that

14
15

the Secretary would ever be able to exercise.

And the

16

reason is we disagree on the details, but the Solicitor

17

General and I agree that, over the years, Congress has

18

had different approaches to expanding Medicare.

19

Sometimes, as in 1972, it makes the

20

expansion voluntary.

That's also, by the way, what

21

happened with the stimulus funds, which were voluntary

22

funds.

23

is why 17 States could say no.

You didn't lose all your Medicaid funds, which

24

Sometimes, they take the voluntary approach.

25

Sometimes, as in 1984, they take the mandatory approach.

84
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If the Secretary exercised the discretion to say, you

2

know what, it really isn't reasonable for you to have to

3

give up your funding for the visually impaired and the

4

disabled, just to cover these newly eligible people, so

5

we will make it voluntary; we'll make that

6

discretionary -- that would essentially be creating --

7

converting a 1984 amendment approach to a 1972 amendment

8

approach, and I just don't think that is the kind of

9

discretion that the Secretary has, with all due respect.

10

Now, moving on to the next point,

11

Justice Alito, your hypothetical, I think, aptly

12

captures the effect on this, based on the fact that

13

these tax dollars are being taken from the State's tax

14

base, and it's not like Steward Machine, where the

15

Federal Government would say, and oh, by the way, if you

16

don't take the option we're giving you, we're going to

17

have a Federal substitute that will go in, and we'll

18

take care of the unemployed in your State.

19

Here, if you don't take this offer that

20

we're giving you, your tax dollars will fund the other

21

49 States, and you'll get nothing.

22

But, of course, this situation is much more

23

coercive, even than your hypothetical, because it is

24

tied directly to the mandate.

25

the participation in the pre-existing program.

It's also tied to

85
Alderson Reporting Company

So, it's

Official

1

as if there was yet another program for post-secondary

2

education; they gave them exactly your option --

3

option -- and then they also said, oh, and by the way,

4

you not only not get these funds, but you lose the

5

post-secondary funds as well.
It's really hard to understand tying the

6
7

pre-existing participation in the program as anything

8

other than coercive.
The Solicitor General makes a lot of the

9
10

fact that there are optional benefits under this

11

program.

12

expansion, there will be a lot less opportunity for the

13

States to exercise those options, because one of the

14

things that the expansion does -- precisely because the

15

expansion is designed to convert Medicaid into a program

16

that satisfies the requirement of the minimum essential

17

coverage of the individual mandate, things that used to

18

be voluntary will no longer be voluntary.

Well, guess what?

After the Medicaid

The perfect example is prescription

19
20

coverage.

That's a big part of the benefits that some

21

States, but not all, provide voluntarily now.

22

no longer be voluntary after the expansion because the

23

Federal Government has deemed prescription drugs to be

24

part of the minimal essential health coverage that

25

everybody in this country must have under the mandate.

86
Alderson Reporting Company

It will

Official

1

So, that option that the State has is being removed by

2

the expansion itself.

3

The Chief Justice made the point --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, may I ask

5

one question about your bottom line in this case?

It

6

sounds to me like everything you said would be to the

7

effect of, if Congress continued to do things on a

8

voluntary basis, so with adding these new eligibles,

9

and say, States, you can have it or not, you can

10

preserve the program as it existed before, you can opt

11

into this.
But you're not asking the Court as relief to

12
13

say, well, that's how we -- that's how we cure the

14

constitutional infirmity; we say this has to be on a

15

voluntary basis.

16

whole Medicaid -- the addition, that the whole expansion

17

has to be nullified and, moreover, the entire Health

18

Care Act.

19

that if we accept your position, everything falls.

Instead, you are arguing that this

Instead of having the easy repair, you say

MR. CLEMENT:

20

Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we

21

can start with the common ground that there's a need for

22

a repair because there is a coercion doctrine and this

23

statute is coercion, then we're into the question of

24

remedy.

25

you describe in the remedy, but we would be certainly

And we do think -- we do take the position that

87
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

happy if we got something here, and we got a recognition

2

that the coercion doctrine exists; this is coercive; and

3

we get the remedy that you suggest in the alternative.

4

Let me just finish by saying that I

5

certainly appreciate what the Solicitor General says,

6

that when you support a policy, you think that the

7

policy spreads the blessings of liberty.

8

respectfully suggest that it's a very funny conception

9

of liberty that forces somebody to purchase an insurance

10
11

But I would

policy whether they want it or not.
And it's a very strange conception of

12

federalism that says that we can simply give the States

13

an offer that they can't refuse, and through the

14

spending power, which is premised on the notion that

15

Congress can do more -- because it's voluntary, we can

16

force the States to do whatever we tell them to.

17

is a direct threat to our federalism.
