ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. YOUNG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. YOUNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before addressing SEIU's motion to dismiss

12

for mootness, it is important to remember the underlying

13

facts of this case.

14

more than 36,000 nonmembers, or nearly 40 percent of

15

those employees represented by SEIU employed by the

16

State of California, were compelled to contribute to

17

SEIU's $12 million Political Fight-Back Fund without

18

being provided the opportunity to challenge the amount

19

of the fee and to object to its exaction, required by

20

the First Amendment.

21

For 10 months in 2005 and 2006,

Adding insult to that injury, the Ninth

22

Circuit said that nonmembers could never say no to

23

contributing to SEIU's political expenditures for ballot

24

propositions, at least Proposition 76.

25

right to refuse to bankroll that element of SEIU's
3
Alderson Reporting Company

They have no

political speech.

2

distorting the political process on a massive scale.

4

This defies this Court's decisions,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Young, could I ask you

to speak to the mootness question first?

5

MR. YOUNG:

I was just addressing that.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

As -- as I understand your

7

brief, you're essentially saying that it's impossible to

8

moot a claim for nominal damages.

9

correct reading of your position?

10

MR. YOUNG:

Is -- is that a

I'm not sure I would go that

11

far, Justice Kagan.

12

wishy-washiness, as it were, of the language used by

13

SEIU when it distributed this pasted-on dollar to the

14

class -- or dollars, more accurately -- was inadequate

15

because it failed to represent the importance of the

16

judgment that the nonmember class had won.

17
18

I think in this case, the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, that's a different

point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate?

19

MR. YOUNG:

That would be correct.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and when you say

21

"inadequate," I read you to be saying sort of not

22

apologetic enough.

23

look, you had a claim against us, we think you're right;

24

it was a valid claim; here is your judgment in

25

satisfaction of that claim.

And -- in other words, not saying,

That it didn't forthrightly

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say that.

But do you think if it had forthrightly said

2

that, we would be living in a different Article III

3

universe?

4

MR. YOUNG:

Not in this case, Justice Kagan.

5

Turning to the adequacy of the notice, of

6

the financial disclosure, that did not comply with the

7

district court's judgment, either.

8

question were the distribution of nominal damages, then

9

perhaps we would be living in that different Article III

If -- if the only

10

universe.

But this case is about the judgment of the

11

district court that the SEIU was attempting to comply

12

with.

13

elements.

They failed to do so in virtually all of its

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And how is that?

How did

15

they fail to comply, other than, you know, the question

16

of whether they were forthright enough about the fact

17

that they were satisfying a claim?

18

MR. YOUNG:

The -- the district court had

19

ordered -- described the type of notice that it

20

anticipated.

21

that SEIU's subsequent 2006 financial disclosure was

22

inadequate to cure the problem that was caused by the

23

seizure of fees starting in September 2005.

24

on 73a of the -- the Petition Appendix B.

25

The district court specifically determined

And that's

The union in this case merely sent the same
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

financial disclosure in the notice that it sent, to try

2

to moot the case, that it had sent in June of 2006.

3

Well, the district court had already said this is

4

inadequate.

5

That seems to me to -- to end the inquiry.
Obviously, the district court did not

6

contemplate that the notice that was sent in June 2006

7

satisfied the obligations of its judgment; else it

8

hardly could have ordered a -- a useless act in ordering

9

a new type of notice go out.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the reason

11

that's important in terms of the content of the notice,

12

the inadequacy, is what?

13

MR. YOUNG:

The reason that is important,

14

Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, excuse me -- is that the

15

SEIU is asserting that the case has become moot because

16

it has now complied with the district court's judgment.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. YOUNG:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your --

It has -I thought your

20

argument was that the -- a different type of notice

21

would have resulted in more members electing to opt out,

22

to demand the refund of their assessments?

23

MR. YOUNG:

And that's certainly one of the

24

possible consequences.

25

that's speculative to some extent.

Obviously, I -- we would --

6
Alderson Reporting Company

But since the

Official

1

purpose of the notice is to provide the information

2

necessary to -- to object, one of the purposes, then we

3

certainly anticipate that there would be more objectors

4

were there to be an -- an adequate notice that complies

5

with the district court's judgment.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the special assessment

7

requires a different kind of notice and possibly a

8

different kind of opt-in or opt-out regime, would the

9

case be moot?
MR. YOUNG:

10
11

If the notice -- I'm sorry.

didn't understand.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we're not dealing here

13

with the kind of notice -- with the typical Hudson

14

notice given at the beginning of the year, when the

15

annual dues are collected.

16

assessment.

17

constitutionally required in that context, would this

18

case be moot?

19

I

We're dealing with a special

Now, if a different kind of notice is

MR. YOUNG:

No, it would not.

Obviously, we

20

have -- we -- we still have the nominal damages question

21

and the adequacy of the payment --

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

My question is whether

23

the -- the different requirements, which presumably were

24

not met here in the context of the special assessment,

25

if there are different requirements in that context,
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would that be enough to preserve this case as a live

2

controversy?

3

MR. YOUNG:

So long as the union failed to

4

provide them, and at least in this case, the district

5

court's judgment, we believe, provides a -- an adequate

6

respect for Hudson's underlying requirements,

7

Justice Alito.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. YOUNG:

Yes, Justice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Mr. -- Mr. Young --

-- as I understand, the

11

union recognizes that a consequence of mootness would be

12

that the Ninth Circuit judgment is vacated.

13

union would also recognize that that means the district

14

court judgment stays in place, so if the Ninth Circuit

15

judgment is worked out and you're left with the district

16

court judgment as the law of the case, then I think it

17

is moot, isn't it?

18

MR. YOUNG:

Now, if the

No, Justice Ginsburg, and this

19

is why:

The union would remain free to return to its

20

old ways, the -- the very type of reason that this Court

21

declined to find mootness in W.T. Grant.

22

made much -- much of a showing -- or much of a show,

23

more accurately, of the fact that it has changed its

24

internal policy.

25

that can hardly be sufficient for this Court to find

The union has

But

and meaningful policy change on 6 days' notice.

The union made this wonderful

But it wasn't -- this --

this case is about a completed episode.

5

special assessment that is long over.

6

MR. YOUNG:

It's about a

That is true, Justice Ginsburg.

7

But it is also about the declaratory relief that was

8

ordered by -- that was entered by the district court.

9

It is about the -- which was virtually injunctive relief

10
11

in this case.
It is also about the effect of that judgment

12

for future activities and -- and how that will affect

13

the way SEIU operates.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. YOUNG:

is -- I'm talking about something that's tantamount to

5

actually phrased as an injunction.

6

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It was an

But isn't that important,

8

Mr. Young, because usually where we've talked about

9

capable of repetition or where we've talked about the

10

same thing could happen again, it's where an injunction

11

has been before us rather than a suit for damages as to

12

a past act?

13

MR. YOUNG:

Yes, Justice Kagan, I think that

14

has been generally the case.

15

could find very few cases where it wasn't clear to me

16

that this Court was addressing injunctive relief.

17

Hudson itself, it seems to me, did not specifically

18

discuss the entry of injunctive relief in the lower

19

court, and Hudson itself addressed a mootness issue.

20

I -- in my research, I

I mean, if we -- if we talk about these

21

cases in their -- in their strictest sense, the union's

22

notices are all annual.

23

24

moot when those notices expire, this Court would never

address these issues because it would -- I can't imagine

So, by the theory that it

2

little as a year.

But the -- this Court in Hudson, in -- I

believe it was footnote 12, said that this Court reviews

5

the policy, the procedure, the acts as they were

6

defended in the district court.

7

and procedure and acts here were defended in the

8

district court.

9

not become moot, because it is capable of repetition and

10

would be evading review simply by the mere limits of how

11

long these policies and procedures are in effect.

12
13

And the union's policy

And, therefore, cases like this should

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you make that argument

in your opposition?

14

MR. YOUNG:

It's -- it seems to me,

15

Justice Kennedy, it is implicit in our argument,

16

although clearly our main point in that argument is that

17

this is a -- a paradigm case of voluntary cessation of

18

allegedly unlawful activity.

19

this case, until the Petitioners' merits brief was

20

filed, SEIU was vigorously defending its practice.

21

remains free to impose that practice.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Until cert was granted in

It

That's another --

23

something quite different than the capable of returning

to litigate it.

And nobody suggested that it would

MR. YOUNG:
Ginsburg.

That's -- that's true, Justice

Pardon me.
This argument -- this argument was not

9

raised until we were before this Court, the union's

10

argument that the case had somehow become moot, and

11

until it issued a notice --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they said that it

13

had become moot because they gave you all the relief you

14

requested; so, there was nothing left to the case.

15

MR. YOUNG:

Well, "all the relief," Justice

16

Ginsburg, implies that they had complied with the

17

district court's judgment.

18

that they have not, and we believe that's clear because

19

of the very fact that the district court rejected the

20

2006 financial disclosure as adequate.

21
22
23
24
25

As to the notice, we believe

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And --

Maybe it's a good

point for you to move to the merits.
MR. YOUNG:

Yes, thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask you a

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question about the merits?

2
3

MR. YOUNG:

Yes, certainly, Justice

Sotomayor.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you attacking the

5

normal system of basing assessments moving forward,

6

based on past accounting and chargeability and

7

non-chargeability?

8

special assessment?

9

Or are you just attacking the

MR. YOUNG:

I -- I appreciate the question,

10

Justice Sotomayor.

No, we are not attacking the normal

11

Hudson procedures.

On --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So,

13

articulate for me what's -- borrowing a phrase from one

14

of my colleagues yesterday, how do we write this

15

opinion?

16

Let's presume for the sake of argument that the union

17

had cost overruns.

18

costs went up, not for lobbying; but generally there was

19

a 10 percent increase in their expenses across the board

20

because various contracts that they were involved in

21

required it.

22

circumstance?

23

When is a second Hudson notice required?

Labor salaries went up; printing

Would you require a second notice in that

MR. YOUNG:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

We

24

would -- we believe -- pardon me -- that a new Hudson

25

notice is required whenever there is a material
13

1

alteration in the obligations that are imposed upon

2

nonmembers.

3
4

The values that this -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Articulate that again.

A material change --

5

MR. YOUNG:

A material increase or --

6

increase in general terms, in the obligation imposed

7

upon the nonmembers.

8

anybody would dispute the 25 percent --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In this case, I don't think

10

MR. YOUNG:

Certainly -Without -- but

without regard to the reason for the assessment?
MR. YOUNG:

20

I think as a matter of principle

21

I would have to say yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

nonmember --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Well, I'm not sure

24

that -- this may just simply be repeating Justice

25

Sotomayor's question, but if they say we have to raise
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the assessment 10 percent because, as she said, you

2

know, we estimated the printing costs for the union

3

newsletter, whatever, was going to be this and it turns

4

out they raised it, it's going to be that; so, we know

5

we're going to have to get additional money, for things

6

that are indisputably chargeable, why do you need

7

special procedures in that case?

8
9
10

MR. YOUNG:

Well, it wouldn't be so much a

special procedure as a new opportunity to object and
challenge the amount of the fee, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

Certainly, one of the elements -- and we

12

recognize, of course, that the primary reason

13

individuals object is political expenditures, but this

14

Court said very clearly in Abood that people can object

15

for any reason, for no reason, for a good reason, for a

16

bad reason; nobody can inquire as to why someone

17

objects.

18

And certainly when a material alteration --

19

there has been a material increase in the obligation

20

imposed upon nonmembers, they may choose to make an

21

economic decision that heretofore they chose not to

22

make.

23

non-objectors.

24

minimize the financial obligation that they are paying

25

to the union at that time.

They may choose to minimize -- particularly the
They may choose that they want to

And -15

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's peculiar because in

2

the circumstance where the extra assessment is all going

3

to go to chargeable activities, in fact that means

4

economically speaking the following year the objector

5

will be better off, not worse off, because there is a

6

higher percentage of the total fee that's being paid to

7

chargeable activities.

8

So, this special assessment that Justice

9

Sotomayor and the Chief Justice were talking about is

10

one that will benefit the objector, if he keeps quiet

11

and says nothing.

12

frame of mind that would say I need the notice because

13

now I might object, whereas I wouldn't have before.

14

So, it's a little hard to imagine the

MR. YOUNG:

Well, Justice Breyer, the reason

15

for the notice is these people may not trust the union.

16

They -- they may choose to challenge the amount of the

17

fee.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I see that point.

19

I ask you -- oh, are you -- you want to pursue that

20

further, or are we --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

Can

Go ahead.

All right.

Let me give you

this example.

24

MR. YOUNG:

Sure.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And now I -- but I think I

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see what your answer is.

Imagine it's year two.

2

year one, expenditures broke down so that it was

3

70 percent chargeable, 30 percent not chargeable.

4

that?

5

MR. YOUNG:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

In

Got

Yes, sir.
And normally, under Hudson,

7

that means in year two the deal is the objectors pay

8

70 percent, right?

9

MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

In the middle of year two,

11

surprisingly, something comes up.

12

A surprise to the union, and they want to have a special

13

assessment.

14

going through this procedure all over again?

15
16
17
18

Something comes up.

And you're saying they just can't without

MR. YOUNG:
Justice Breyer.

That would be correct,

The -- I'm now talking about --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And take the money that

they collected?

19

MR. YOUNG:

I'm sorry.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can they take the money

21

that they collected under the first notice, and, instead

22

of doing the special assessment, in the middle of it,

23

this campaign gets announced by the governor, and can

24

they then divert the chargeable amount that they had

25

predicted and spend it on the non-chargeable amount?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Or

Official

1

are you -- or does that require a second Hudson notice?

2

Without a special assessment.

3
4

MR. YOUNG:

I understand, Justice Sotomayor.

And no, under that case, I don't believe it would.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, this is a

6

peculiar rule that you have asked us to adopt.

The rule

7

is that where there is a special assessment and it will

8

make all the objectors better off, they have to have a

9

special notice that they can object.

But where the rule

10

is that we're going to take money we already collected

11

from them and spend it for a totally political purpose,

12

we don't give them a special notice and they don't have

13

to object.

14

Now, that seems totally backwards, but I

15

understand why you get there, and my suspicion is --

16

which you can confirm, is that's the only administrable

17

system you can think of.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you concede that it's

19

going to make them better off?

20

assume that that's your principal objection.

21

know whether this new assessment is indeed going to be

22

divided the way the original one was or not.

24

MR. YOUNG:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They don't

That's --- whether -- whether it's

all going to be used for -- for assessable activities or

2

not.

3

no --

And they have no -- you're telling me they have

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

But in my

hypothetical --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

At the very least, they

7

have to make a -- an interest-free loan to the -- to the

8

union until such time as they can challenge it.

9
10

MR. YOUNG:
Justice Scalia.

11

Well, that's exactly correct,

And I understand --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but the hypothetical,

12

if I could continue with it, is -- is perhaps

13

unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and 14 most honest

14

people in the United States, and they've all absolutely

15

guaranteed, and everybody agrees, that this goes to

16

chargeable activity.

question, which you see where I was -- you're with me on

18

this, right?

And where I was going with my

MR. YOUNG:

You anticipate my next point,

Justice Scalia.

17

due respect to our litigation opponents in this case,

18

these are people that nonmembers don't trust.

19

people with whom nonmembers do not wish to affiliate.

And these are people that the nonmembers do not wish to

support, and --

22

These -- these aren't bishops, and with

Sotomayor, understanding the --

Is there an answer to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's true of

19

the first example I gave you.

20

the middle of the year and the union needs to divert

21

already-assessed funds to challenge a election, they can

22

do it.

23

If something happens in

the chance to challenge that, but it would be within the

We -- we, and I believe this Court in

2

Hudson, presume that any reasonable -- reasonably

3

competent union management would -- would have

4

relatively stable expenditures over the years.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't -- isn't the premise

6

of Hudson that you give the notice before, before -- you

7

receive the notice before you have to cough up the

8

money?

9

MR. YOUNG:

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

And what's now proposed is,

11

well, for -- if there's an additional assessment, you

12

cough up the money first, and then later you straighten

13

it out.

And I -- do you get -- do you get the interest?

14

MR. YOUNG:

That seems to me to be the

15

problem, Justice Scalia.

The people who got the June --

16

June 2005 notice were left in the dark -- indeed, the

17

union may have been in the dark -- as to this special

18

assessment.

19

impose the special assessment, the union was required by

20

Hudson's principles to shed some light.

21

perhaps it is less predictive, less accurate, to say we

22

intend to spend the money this way.

23

an assessment which is purely intended for politics, and

24

that's what the union said, to create a Political

I thought your Hudson notice told you this was

description of it?

MR. YOUNG:

I think -- I think that would be

14

a fair description, Justice Breyer.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do they -- do they

17

carry over from one year to the next, or do you have to

18

refile your objection to the union expenditures every

19

year?

20

MR. YOUNG:

Most unions, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

require an annual objection.

Now, of course, there

22

would be nothing -- we find nothing wrong with an annual

23

challenge requirement if you choose to challenge that

24

year's figures, because obviously it's a specific event.

8

forget about special assessments.

I think in one of the

9

briefs, I know in one of the briefs, someone says

10

elections happen every 4 years.

11

of union activities, in an election year they're going

12

to divert more of whatever accessible moneys they have

13

to their lobbying efforts, and the following year

14

they'll go back to normal for 3 years.
You're not challenging that normal variation

15
16

So, in the normal cycle

in the -- in the distribution of the moneys, correct?

17

MR. YOUNG:

Correct, Justice Sotomayor.

And

18

that, too, may vary from union to union, from State to

19

State even.

20

Virginia has called for --

21

As some of the Justices I'm sure know,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, I guess my problem

22

is I don't see how that, given your argument, is any

23

less alone than this special assessment where the

24

labor -- where the objecting members at the end of the

25

year will get notice of what has happened that year,

will have an opportunity to place their Lehnert

Justice Breyer said, have a benefit because they're

the Lehnert challenges are upheld or pay more if -- if

they're not.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Collins, as I understand

Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about

19

the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute

20

about whether it was clear enough, about that it was

21

satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about

22

whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr.

23

Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the

24

district court's order.

25

Now, as long as that's true, don't we have a

question about whether your notice complied with the

3

order, and if it's the case that a court has to answer

4

that question, doesn't that depend on the questions

5

presented here, the substantive questions?

6

Somebody has to answer that

MR. COLLINS:

No, it doesn't, Justice Kagan.

7

And the Court's explained in a number of cases,

8

beginning I think with Walling v. Reuter and also,

9

obviously, Munsingwear and U.S. Bancorp, a case can be

10

in a posture where this Court, in disposing of it, needs

11

to grant certain relief or clarification of the status

12

of prior orders; and yet, the case is moot on the merits

13

such that the Court cannot appropriately reach the

14

merits.
That's what we have here.

15

If there is a

16

dispute -- and I'll explain in a moment why there really

17

isn't.

18

whether an individual failed to get their refund because

19

the notice was inadequate, that dispute is not affected

20

by and requires no decision of this Court.

The district court specifically held, at

assessments --

incremental cost is to the union of giving such notice?

12

because --

I

wasn't looking to monopolize you.
MR. COLLINS:

15

I understand, but I believe --

16

I believe the word "special assessment" is being used

17

here with a meaning that doesn't correspond to what this

union did.

19

there's been only one other case in any Federal court

20

that I'm aware of, and only in a district court, there's

21

been no other appellate court, dealing with any kind of

22

assessment, a temporary dues increase, and how it

23

affects Hudson rights.

24
25

I can say this much:

There's never --

world.

There are -- there are no challenges that have
33
Alderson Reporting Company

-- that have been made previously to any kinds of

2

assessments or increases.

3

But unions use assessments in two -- in many

4

different ways.

happened here, and I think it will show why there's no

6

serious question here about a need for a notice.

7

And let me contrast one way with what

Some unions have a dues structure which

covers only certain kinds of activities.

And they

contemplate a new kind of activity that they would not

10

normally pay for out of dues or fees.

That kind of an assessment can raise

22

potential issues, I would acknowledge, under Hudson.

23

It's worlds away from what we have here because all that

happened in this case was that the union increased, from

25

1 percent to 1.25 percent of salary, the regular

membership dues and the fees based on those dues that

2

were deducted by employers and paid into the union's

JUSTICE ALITO:

If I understand the

16

hypothetical, there could be a problem there if the

17

assumption is then that the union really is beginning a

18

kind of spending that's really foreign to the way it's

19

spent money in the past.
What needs to be explained here, though,

20
21

Justice Alito, I don't think one would guess from

22

anything that has been said today that we're talking

23

about a period of time when the union's chargeable

24

spending increased and its non-chargeable spending

25

decreased.

We're talking about a period of time when

objecting nonmembers did not even pay their pro rata

2

share of the concededly chargeable expenditures, meaning

3

they did not pay one penny for any political activities.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, as I said, my

5

hypothetical may be very different from what happened

6

here, and maybe it's an unrealistic hypothetical; and

7

you can answer that.

8

should there not be Hudson notice?

9

But if -- if it were to occur,

MR. COLLINS:

Well, the problem -- it would

10

be a closer question, but I think not, because, again,

11

I think in your hypothetical, one might

In this case, however -- and this is crucial
to this case -- the notice in 2005 told every nonmember

10

that, of our $38 million budget, we spent 43.6 percent

11

of it last year on non-chargeable activities.

12

you do not object, we will spend whatever amount out of

13

our roughly $40 million budget in the coming year on

14

various activities as we perceive the need, including

15

specifically ballot initiatives, which were specifically

16

mentioned in the notice as one of the things the union

17

spent its money on.

And if

18

Now --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

point, though -- this was a very special ballot

21

initiative.

22

this was not sort of the normal run in the course --

23

every 2 years, every election cycle, we spend something.

24

That's why it's a special assessment.

25

MR. COLLINS:

I thought your

That's what the literature suggests, that

Well, I don't -- I wouldn't

2

it's usually used, to mean a very short-term assessment

3

apart from general union functions for a new kind of

4

function.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, it's not

short-term; it's just until November 7th or whatever.
MR. COLLINS:

But it's nothing new under the

8

sun, Mr. Chief Justice.

And we can see that -- for

9

example, the record reflects the audit for 2005 shows us

10

that, in addition to the money that was attributed to

11

the dues increase and spent in opposing these ballot

12

propositions, additional money, approximately

13

$2 million, was spent on those same purposes from the

14

pre-increase dues.

15

So, ballot -- opposing ballot initiatives is

16

nothing new for this union.

at the beginning of, say, September -- say it goes

back to year one, and we see what the percentages were.

And we go and get approval or opt-outs on that basis.

Now, what I thought coming in here is that

2

the problem was going to be, if you have to have a new

3

notice in the middle of the year for special political

4

assessments, you're going to discover that half the time

5

you don't know if they're special political assessments.

6

It's an impossible line to draw.

7

It's really tough.

You're making the argument that however you

8

draw the line, we're on the right side of it, not the

9

wrong side.

Isn't that what -- basically what you're

10

saying?

11

really -- et cetera.

12

It's not a special assessment.

It wasn't

Okay.

Now -- but there's a new argument that's

13

come along that I hadn't focused on, that we can avoid

14

the administrative problem by saying all special

15

assessments require a new notice, whether they're for

16

political purposes or not.

17

was trying to get -- I was very interested in your

18

answer.

19

of saying which is which, how does that affect the

20

union?

21

How often is it that you draw up your budget for year

22

two in September, you put it into effect, and then

23

during the year, you discover you need more money from

24

people for any reason, and, therefore, you change what

25

you thought they were going to contribute?

assessments take many different forms from -- and I

13

think there are crucial distinctions -- from funding

14

what would -- a kind of charge that would not otherwise

15

be funded out of dues for some short period of time, to

16

the opposite extreme, what we have here and what I don't

17

think would be called an assessment frankly by anything

18

I've read, a temporary dues increase which became

19

permanent and which simply increased the total flow of

20

dues and fees into the general treasury and which went

21

for the usual -- the kinds of activities the union had

always funded.

And in that regard, there's one --

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. COLLINS:

All right?

The burden.

The burden consists of two

3

things, Justice Sotomayor.

The -- if a union has to

4

give a new Hudson notice in a situation like this,

5

whereas I've been trying to explain the spending that

6

went on is really not different from what one would have

7

reasonably anticipated given the notice, then we have

8

litigation and disputes about the need for new notices

9

whenever any number of things happen, because one thing

10

that happened here that is undisputed but hasn't been

11

discussed is that collective bargaining costs were up

12

six-fold in 2005 over 2004, and they were up six-fold in

13

2006 over 2005.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One reason -- I

15

mean, we're dealing with the situation where the union

16

is compelling nonunion members to give them money for

17

political activities.

18

as I read it, because you can't figure out what that is,

19

you wait until the end of the year.

20

it's a compromise for administrative convenience.

21

Normally, you wouldn't allow it at all, as -- at least

22

under the law as I read it, you would not allow people

23

to take money -- you would not allow the union to take

24

money from people who don't want to spend it on

25

political activities so the union can spend it on

We allow, as I understand Hudson,

2

of the year because it's impossible as you go on to sort

3

these things out.

4

side was when you have a special assessment, an

5

additional charge, there you don't have the

6

administrative problem.

7

So, you can't take that until you tell them, do you want

8

to object or are you happy -- are you fine with having

9

this spent on political purposes?

10

But we allow that in the course

I thought the argument on the other

MR. COLLINS:

You can tell it's .25 percent.

The reason, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

that it isn't that straight forward is quite simply that

12

all of these questions about it's a special assessment,

13

we can figure out what it is, we can treat it

14

separately, flounder when one realizes that the

15

so-called special assessment is simply a dues increase,

16

because if I were to try to imagine -- let's try to

17

imagine the notice that could have been given.

18

giving a new notice in the fall of 2005 to explain to

19

all nonmembers how things look now compared to what

20

they -- how they may have looked when the Hudson notice

21

was given, I would say the following, completely

22

consistent with all the facts of record in this case as

23

revealed in the audits.

24

we need more income.

25

anticipate $3.7 million in fight-back expenses this

I would say:

If I was

We've determined

Part of this is because we

year.

Another part is we expect more than $3-1/2

2

million of additional bargaining costs this year, and we

3

expect a lot of other changes in our costs.

4

On the Petitioners' theory -- and this is

5

why Schermerhorn is the complete answer to their

6

theory -- there's a constitutional violation if the

7

union says we're going to view this increase as paying

8

for our additional political costs, and it's going to

9

free up our bargaining -- our general treasury for the

10

bargaining.

11

going to treat this increase as covering those new

12

bargaining costs we told you about, that's going to free

13

up our general treasury for the political costs --

14

That's a violation.

But if you say we're

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But on the -- I'm

15

reading from the district court opinion.

16

this assessment would be used -- and they're quoting

17

from union material -- "for a broad range of political

18

expenses, including television, radio advertising,

19

direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and

20

get out the vote activities in our work sites and in

21

communities across California."

22

quote, "The fund will not be used for regular costs of

23

the union such as office rent, staff salaries or routine

24

equipment replacement."

25

MR. COLLINS:

It said that

And it further said,

But two points,
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Chief Justice:

First, as the court of appeals

2

pointed out, there were other statements that said the

3

money would be used for both purposes.

4

But, as Schermerhorn points out,

5

Schermerhorn says even if you specifically say this part

6

of our dues income is going to be earmarked for this

7

purpose, it's artificial when you're dealing with a

8

general union treasury, not a separate segregated fund,

9

to give that separate legal status.

And that -- because

10

that is why -- my point to you, Mr. Chief Justice, is

11

nothing in the world would have changed here.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. COLLINS:

15

3

a nonmember who doesn't want those ballot initiatives to

4

be defeated, saying that we're going to give you your

5

money back -- we're going to use your money to achieve a

6

political end that you oppose, but don't worry because

7

we're going to give it back to you next year after we've

8

achieved our political end -- how does that solve the

9

problem?

If you look at this from the perspective of

MR. COLLINS:

10

But what's the

That's not the situation here,

11

Justice Alito.

The nonmembers were told in June 2005 in

12

the Hudson notice that if you don't object, we may spend

13

millions of dollars on political activities, including

14

ballot initiatives.

15

that, they merely need to object.

16

and this is what gets lost in the messaging about the

17

dues increase.

18

in the period that followed is that, compared to the

19

numbers in the 2004 Hudson notice, the union spent less

20

on non-chargeable matters and more on chargeable

21

matters.

22

Court is that the union, for whatever PR purposes,

12

MR. COLLINS:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

Let me ask you this --

15

In collective bargaining negotiations, do the unions

16

consider the -- as one factor the importance of ensuring

17

that the governmental employer has fiscal stability?

18
19
20

MR. COLLINS:

That's generally considered,

yes, by unions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, isn't that

21

ultimately a political judgment, so that even collective

22

bargaining involves a core political judgment?

23

MR. COLLINS:

And that's exactly what the

24

Court said in Abood.

And the reason that exclusivity

25

and agency fees are permitted in -- in serving an
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

important government purpose is that the government has

2

concluded that its interest lies in having an exclusive

3

spokesperson who -- with whom it can negotiate so that

4

it won't have an array of different employment relations

5

or different --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you -- you concede, in

7

ordinary collective bargaining, there are critical and

8

important political -- significant political judgments

9

that are being made by the union in the course of

10
11

collective bargaining with chargeable expenses?
MR. COLLINS:

Absolutely.

And Abood

12

explicitly says that, and Abood then says that,

13

nevertheless, the government -- we're talking about a

14

regulatory scheme to promote the government's interest

15

in orderly labor relations.

16

make arrangements and agreements on terms of employment.

17

It has a vital interest in having an exclusive

18

representational arrangement where that can be

19

accomplished.

20

it's not challenged by Petitioners -- that justifies the

21

degree of impingement that's inherent in the fact that,

elements in it.

Mr. Young, I hope this

9

What if the union here had simply said all

It can indeed use its -- the anticipated

MR. YOUNG:

It would be free to do so,

Justice Scalia.

MR. YOUNG:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they don't lose it;

6

they're going to do it the following September.

The

7

attractive part of your argument from the beginning was

8

that this is somehow a forced loan.

9

the attractiveness of that.

And I understand

But it goes back to what

10

Justice Breyer said from the beginning, which is, given,

11

as has been recognized, that money is fungible and that

12

you can't really often predict what's going to happen in

13

the future, it's been developed a system that cyclically

14

gets money to the people back.

15

MR. YOUNG:

And money is fungible to a

16

degree, Justice Sotomayor -- Sotomayor -- excuse me.

17

And I respect that argument, but let's remember the

18

facts as we have them here.

19

it was a segregated fund.

20

21

In the facts of this case,

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but the -- the problem

3

if you win in this case, and then there is this other

4

way of getting to the same -- the same result, is that

5

the other way of getting to the same result, while

6

permissible, is far less transparent.

7

understand it, and it -- it encourages a kind of slyness

8

that seems highly undesirable.

9

And people won't

And the virtue of the present system is that

10

it does require some forced loans, that's true, but it

11

does wash out in the wash, and it ends up being fair to

better system that doesn't provide more administrative

problems than the existing one.

20

And for ordinary union dues, that's why when Justice

21

Sotomayor asked me at the beginning of the argument
