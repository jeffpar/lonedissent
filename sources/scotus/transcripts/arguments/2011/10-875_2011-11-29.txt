ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. FREEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MS. FREEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Bankruptcy estates incur taxes when they

12

generate income.

13

effect of the farm sale statute, section 1222(a)(2)(A),

14

alters that fundamental principle in corporate chapter

15

11 cases and in all bankruptcy cases, as it requires

16

this Court to construe the administrative section in the

17

priority section of the Bankruptcy Code that do apply in

18

all of those cases.

19

The Government's attempt to limit the

In a chapter 12 case, the bankruptcy estate

20

consists of more than just the assets that existed as of

21

the date of filing.

22

income that is earned thereafter, wages -- Mrs. Hall's

23

wages as a convenience store clerk are part of the

24

bankruptcy estate -- the proceeds from selling crops --

25

They also consist of all of the

incurred after the filing?

2

MS. FREEMAN:

From the period -- from the

3

petition filing date until the confirmation of the plan,

4

yes, it does.

5

of the estate --

6
7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Debts -- debts that were

incurred after that date?

8
9

Those debts are incurred in the operation

MS. FREEMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

So that, for

example, in operating an estate, you would incur a light

10

bill as well as incurring taxes.

11

expenses are incurred by the bankruptcy estate and are

12

payable from the income and from the estate assets

13

during that period from the petition filing date until

14

the confirmation of the plan.

County taxes, for

Property -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, in this -- in this --

24

we're dealing with a capital gains tax on the sale of

25

the farm.

Suppose a State had a similar tax; it also

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

taxed the gain on the sale.

2

MS. FREEMAN:

Correct, Your Honor, and it

3

did in this particular case.

So, there would be State

4

taxes on the capital gains, and those would also be

5

administrative expense priorities, except for the farm

6

sale provision here, which demotes that priority if the

7

debtor is able to earn a discharge.

8

those farm sale taxes are demoted in priority and may be

9

discharged under a plan of reorganization.

And if so, then

They would

19

Your Honor, is shown by the Knudsen case.

20

basically, there would be a tax return that includes all

21

of the income, the wages, the crop sale proceeds and so

forth.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, how do you deal

with section 346?

6

MS. FREEMAN:

Section 346, Your Honor,

7

basically makes the State taxes consistent with the

8

Federal taxes.

9

When you have --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I read 346(b) to say

10

that, unless the estate is a separate tax entity under

11

the code, that the debtor, not the estate, pays State

12

and local taxes.

13

you're saying, but the language of 346(b) --

This is totally contrary to what

14

MS. FREEMAN:

Your Honor --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- basically answers the

16

question against you with respect to State and local

17

taxes.

18

MS. FREEMAN:

Justice Sotomayor, I do not

19

think it does, in the sense -- in this sense:

20

bankruptcy -- section 346(b) made the State and local

21

taxes consistent with Federal taxes, and when you have a

22

bankruptcy estate that consists only of assets on the

23

petition filing date, then you have a separate taxable

24

entity with a separate tax I.D. number that is set up.

25

But under the Federal bankruptcy -- under the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

7
1

tax code, under section 1399, whenever the bankruptcy

2

estate had income during the course of the estate,

3

during the administration period, as well as the assets

4

on the petition filing date, then it's a single taxable

5

entity.

6

And so, that single taxpayer would pay it.
Section 346 doesn't say what assets are used

7

to pay the tax.

That's a matter of bankruptcy law.

8

debtor, the individual taxpayer, is going to file the

9

tax return under State and local and Federal law, but

The

10

he's going to use the estate assets because that's all

11

there is.

12
13

He doesn't have any other assets.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, the debtor is going

to pay.

14

MS. FREEMAN:

The debtor pays --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, when this says

16

whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that

17

no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case

18

concerning a debtor under this title --

19

MS. FREEMAN:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

Right.
-- chapter 12 doesn't

create a separate taxable estate.

22

MS. FREEMAN:

Correct.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that the income,

24

et cetera, shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor

25

under State or local law.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

MS. FREEMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

It's going to be on the debtor's tax return.

3

debtor's the one who will have the deductions, and the

4

deductions would include administrative expenses of the

5

bankruptcy estate.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

me to understand, given the last line.

8

shall be liable for any tax imposed on such corporation

9

or partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners

10

"The estate

or members."

11

By the logic of that last sentence, it seems

12

to me that the preceding section is not looking to the

13

estate, but to the debtor, to pay the taxes.

14

MS. FREEMAN:

The debtor pays the taxes, but

15

with estate assets because those are the only assets

16

that exist.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why -- why would the

last sentence be necessary?
MS. FREEMAN:

The last sentence, I believe,

20

Your Honor, deals with a partnership, and in a

21

partnership case, just as outside the bankruptcy, the

22

partnership files the tax return and the partners

23

individually are the ones who pay the taxes.

if Joe Smith has loaned his farm some money during that

Well, but I mean,

MS. FREEMAN:

This case, Your Honor, because

of this appeal, has lasted from 2005 through today.

16

during that period of time and all of the operating

17

expenses during that period of time are administrative

expenses and are payable in the ordinary course.

There's an administrative expense claim if in fact they

So,

And all of the taxes

priority, and this is consistent with the Court's

3

Nicholas case, 1966, which preceded the Bankruptcy Code

4

and which the Bankruptcy Code really incorporated and

5

continued with.

6

So, you do have that highest

In the Nicholas case, the Court said that

7

all taxes incurred by a debtor-in-possession and

8

incurred during the administration period have

9

administrative expense priority, and they are payable by

10

the debtor-in-possession as an officer of the court, as

11

-- as the administrator of the estate under 28 U.S.C.

12

section 960, which is still in effect today, and which

13

requires that the person in control of the bankruptcy

14

estate, whether it's a trustee or a

15

debtor-in-possession, pay those taxes, but not pay them

16

with his own money.

17

As the Court said in the Nicholas case, you

18

pay them with the assets of the estate.

19

trustee is not responsible; the individual

20

debtor-in-possession is not responsible.

21

responsibility of the debtor-in-possession really is a

matter of the discharge provisions, whether he's going

23

to be separately discharged or if he has responsible

stronger arguments is, it may make sense.

wanted it, they didn't do it right technically.

didn't amend the right provision of the code, and

So,

that you want.
I'll tell you the best I could do -- and I

12

see a problem with it -- is you say that -- you go to

13

1226(b)(1), and it says that any unpaid claim of the

14

kind specified in 507(a)(2); and 507(a)(2) talks about

15

administrative expenses and refers you to 503; and 503

16

includes taxes and administrative expenses; and then you

17

say it's -- at 1220 whatever it is, what did I just say?

18

MS. FREEMAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MS. FREEMAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

1226?

Uh-huh.
It's like an Abbott and

Costello movie.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

1226.

The -- the -- you get to

1226(b)(1), and it says that that's -- shall be paid any

Alderson Reporting Company

unpaid payments of that kind, including administrative

2

expenses.

3

refers to that, and then the amendment applies to that.

4

But, now, what I did was I sloughed over by

And -- and so, then you have 1222(a), which

5

talking too quickly -- it talked about "claim" -- of a

6

"claim," it says, any unpaid claim of the kind specified

7

in 507(a)(2).

8

about claims and expenses; and then in (2) there, it

9

refers to administrative expenses.

And when you look to 507(a)(2), it talks

11

word "expenses."

Now, I don't know what I'm doing

13

when I start tinkering with this Bankruptcy Code.

14

we were to read the word "claims" there to include

17

expenses?

10

(1)(b), and -- and also administrative expenses in (2).

11

Can I do that?

12

MS. FREEMAN:

You can, Your Honor, because

13

"claim" is defined in section 101 of the code as right

14

to payment.

15

claim that arose prepetition, which necessarily means

16

"claim" is broader and not just one that arose

18

"Creditor" is defined as someone who has a

There are numerous provisions of the

19

Bankruptcy Code that refer to administrative expenses as

20

claims, including 1226.

21

those are interpreted consistently.

22

And so, the Court can see that

This Court, in the Hartford Underwriters

23

case, referred to administrative claims, calling them

24

claims as well as administrative.

25

Government's argument here is that administrative

And really what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

expenses are outside of bankruptcy altogether, that

2

they're not part of what get paid in a bankruptcy case.

3

And that's simply untrue.

4

If the Court looks at the provisions with

5

respect to requirements of a plan, including 1222(a),

6

which apart from the exception, it says that

7

administrative expenses are required to be paid.

8

Section 1228 says that a plan discharges all debts

9

including debts provided for -- allowed under section

10

503.

Debt is a liability on a claim.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

first question, what actually happens?

13

isn't the first year of chapter 12 and 13.

14

MS. FREEMAN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that doesn't answer my
I mean, this

Right.
And there must be instances

16

where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are

17

pretty big --

18

MS. FREEMAN:

And --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and there isn't enough

20

money to go around, and they're going to have to be paid

21

out of future income along with the prepetition debts.

22

And it can be done, but there is a question of

23

priorities, and the Government is saying there is no

24

priority -- I think they're saying that -- for a

25

postpetition debt.

And -- and you're saying, oh, but of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18

4

course there is.
So, what actually happens?

perhaps thousands and thousands of cases, haven't there?
MS. FREEMAN:

And administrative expenses do

5

get paid in the ordinary course.

6

aren't paid --

7

10
11

There have been

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if the taxes

Get paid, if necessary, by

assigning priorities?
MS. FREEMAN:

Yes.

They have administrative

priority, and they do get paid.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And so, to look to a

12

hornbook on bankruptcy law which just tells me what

13

you've just said, I would look where?

14

MS. FREEMAN:

We -- we've cited a number of

15

hornbooks that have exactly that provision.

16

particularly interesting with respect to the

17

Government's position here is that, at the Government's

18

urging, section 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, that

19

provided for prepetition priority, eighth priority, for

20

prepetition taxes within a short period before the

21

Bankruptcy Code, was amended; so that all of those

22

eighth priority taxes during the year of the filing, the

23

straddle year -- here the Halls filed their bankruptcy

24

case in August; so, during the entire period from

25

January 1 through August when they filed -- are treated

Alderson Reporting Company

What's

as administrative expenses.

2

administrative expenses mean nothing, and they don't get

3

any payment as administrative expenses.

4

And yet, now they say

Why urge the change?

Why make all of those

5

year-of-filing taxes into administrative expenses and

6

then say administrative expenses have no meaning?

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm going to ask the

8

Government this, but are you aware of any circuit split

9

or any cases below that have accepted the Government's

10

arguments that chapter 12 involves prepetition debts

11

only and that don't pay administrative expenses

12

that no separate taxable entity shall result from the

4

How can you incur a tax when you are not a

MS. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, because you are a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15

MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

16

The postpetition income tax liability at

17

issue in this case is not subject to section

18

1222(a)(2)(A) and thus cannot be treated as a

19

dischargeable nonpriority debt for two reasons.

20

consistent with the structure of chapter 12, a chapter

21

12 plan is limited to prepetition debts and does not

22

cover postpetition debts, including administrative

23

expenses.

24

are paid separately through section 1226(b)(1), which

25

contains no farm sale exception.

First,

Rather, postpetition administrative expenses

Because section

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

1222(a)(2)(A) strips priority only from a subset of

2

claims covered by a chapter 12 plan and does not alter

3

which debts fall within that plan, it cannot apply to

4

the postpetition tax liability at issue.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, what -- what farm

6

sales would be included?

7

benefit that Senator Grassley obviously wanted them to

8

have?

9

MR. SHAH:

What farm sales would get this

Your Honor, it would be

10

prepetition sales.

11

incurred from a prepetition sale, those would be

12

priority expenses covered under a chapter 12 plan under

13

section 1222(a)(2), because they fall under -- they're

14

an -- they're a priority claim under section 507(a).

15

That is, any capital gains tax

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does that -- does

16

that make sense, though, in terms of if you're talking

17

about farmers and fishermen and you're talking about the

18

treatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm

19

or typically the boat, and they either want to try --

20

they want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they

21

go into bankruptcy, and the big issue is how that

22

asset's going to be treated.

23

not in the bankruptcy at all; it's outside of it.

24

seems to me to be at least counterintuitive.

25

MR. SHAH:

And your position is it's
That

Well, Your Honor, two points:

Alderson Reporting Company

One, as a practical matter, chapter 12 is a

2

reorganization provision.

3

designed to allow farmers to get out of the business of

4

farming.

5

will try to reorganize some of their farm sale assets,

6

sell some of their livestock, change their farming

7

operation, to see if they can save it outside of

8

bankruptcy first.

9

This is not a provision just

So, often what will happen is that farmers

10

the Knudsen case.

11

go Petitioners' way.

12

the postpetition tax liability of the type at issue in

13

this case; it also had a significant prepetition tax

14

liability component in that case based upon just what I

15

was explaining, the farmer trying to -- trying to change

16

their farming operation to save the farm without having

17

to go into bankruptcy.

18

Knudsen is the only circuit case to
In Knudsen, it not only involved

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But also, I gather,

19

it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers

20

that might want to sell part of the farm.

21

they have dairy and corn operations or something, and

22

they sell one to try to preserve the other.

23

-- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be

24

considered in the bankruptcy context.

And that's

And yet, your

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, it certainly

happens within the bankruptcy, and I'm not disputing

4

your point that that may -- that may arise in a

5

bankruptcy case just like it arises in this case.

6

it will be dealt through the bankruptcy.

7

sale will happen, and it will be approved by the

8

bankruptcy court.

9

10

And

That is, the

The question is, how do you treat the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a big

11

deal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work,

12

whether they -- I mean, what the amount was here was big

13

for the farmer, and the idea of, well, we're going to

14

pretend that's not at issue here seems to me to be --

15

again, not -- not to make a lot of sense.

16

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, we're not asking, to

17

be clear, to pretend that that's not there.

How the tax

18

liability would be dealt with under the Government's

19

view is at the time the debtor moves to sell the farm

20

asset during the bankruptcy case -- like in this case,

21

that sale of the farm asset generated $960,000.

22

was the sale price.

23

this case is $29,000.

24

that $960,000 sale price $29,000 to pay the capital

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But there's every reason to

3

think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about

4

here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be

5

approved at all because there were very high capital

6

gains taxes that would result from a sale and that that

7

was the problem that everybody was focused on, was

8

making sure that farmers could take advantage of section

9

12.

So, it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more

10

than a little bit odd.

11

statute to apply not in that context but only as to

12

people who have somehow managed to sell their property,

13

14

MR. SHAH:

It's a lot odd to read the

Sure.

So, Your Honor, when you

15

say that everybody was focused on this problem, we have

16

the evidence of exactly one person as to what one

17

legislator thought that this bill would do.

18

Senator Grassley.

19

statements do indicate an intent on his part to reach

20

postpetition taxes.

21

framework does not permit that result.

22

That's

Now, admittedly, Senator Grassley's

But the pre-existing statutory

What section 1222(a)(2)(A) does is it allows

23

the debtor to strip priority from a certain subset of

24

governmental claims, such as prepetition taxes, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33

certain claims that are already entitled to priority

under a chapter 12 plan, such as prepetition taxes.

3

both sides agree that that's how section 1220(a)(2)(A)

4

works.

And

There's no dispute about that.

5

The dispute is about whether this

6

postpetition tax liability comes within the chapter 12

7

plan in the first place.

8

pre-existing code provisions, part of the 1978 Act, part

9

of the 1980 Act, and the 1986 Act.

That dispute turns on

Whatever deference

10

Senator Grassley is owed as to the operation of section

11

1220(a)(2)(A) itself, he's owed no deference whatsoever

12

as to the proper interpretation of those pre-existing

13

code provisions.

14

It's our position that those pre-existing

15

code provisions, section 503(b), section 346, and

16

section 1398, 1399, all lead to the result that

17

postpetition tax liabilities are not an administrative

18

expense within the meaning of the code.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about employment tax?

Now, as a matter

of discretion, the IRS has chosen not to treat them

That is, they don't try to seek those as
I think there would be an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

argument -- and we set this -- set forth the argument in

2

a footnote of our brief.

3

would be is that they could be deemed an administrative

4

expense not because they're incurred by the estate, but

5

under the other part of the definition of an

6

administrative expense under 503(b)(1)(A).

7

11

What the potential argument

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just following up on

that -MR. SHAH:

Sure.

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- I'm looking for what I'd

call past practice, where there must be a lot --

12

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that would shed some

14

light on this.

So, I see -- your point that we cannot

15

call these taxes administrative expenses is because when

16

that's defined in 503 for the entire code --

17

MR. SHAH:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Yes.
-- it talks about

administrative expenses incurred by the estate.

20

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so, you're saying here

22

are three people who incurred their own taxes.

23

section -- section 12; one is section 13; and one is

24

individuals in section 11.

25

MR. SHAH:

Is that right?

Ah --

Alderson Reporting Company

One is

35
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

At least that's my --

2

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes.

Okay.

So, we have

4

three categories of people that -- where the taxes,

5

literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes.

6

the bite would come up if it turned out, when they were

7

getting around to settle these things, that there isn't

8

enough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's --

9

no, to pay fully domestic support obligations, wages,

10
11

Now,

and also Federal taxes.
Isn't that -- that's where it's going to

12

show up, because the question will be, do you have to

13

shave the Federal taxes because they're coming in to be

14

paid as an administrative expense priority which is

15

only there as number 2, I think, in light of number 1.

16

Or do you not shave them at all?

17

personally, there isn't any reduction in the amount of

18

the Federal Government -- if they're allowed because

19

it's one of the estate's expenses basically, using the

20

estate very, very loosely, then they would have to take

21

a reduction, too.

Am I right?

If they're liable

Are you following it?

22

MR. SHAH:

I think so.

Let me try to say

23

what I think what you're saying.

24

13, if it is in fact a priority claim, whether it's a

25

priority claim or an administrative expense, those have

Under chapter 12 and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

to be paid in full.

2

court to shave those --

3

There isn't an ability for the

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

The administrative

4

expenses don't have to be paid in full if there isn't

5

enough money for them too in unsecured claims for

6

domestic support obligations, because administrative

7

expenses is the second priority; it isn't the first.

8
9

MR. SHAH:

Okay.

So, Your Honor, there is a

misunderstanding I think in what you are saying.

That

10

is, in a chapter 12 plan, the priorities matter more in

11

terms of the relative priority between category 1, 2, 3,

12

4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

13

14

Could you turn back

finish your thought on what you're doing with wages?

Are they given priority or aren't they?

7

saying they're not -- if we accept your reading of this,

8

employee wage taxes are not administrative expenses.

The "incurred by the estate" language, as

Because this was a part of your argument that

I have to say sort of tripped me up --

2

MR. SHAH:

Okay.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- because you define

"incurred by the estate" by reference to those

5

provisions, but those provisions were enacted 2 years

and 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to

7

define.

8

MR. SHAH:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, it must have been a very

prescient Congress.
MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor it was a

12

prescient Congress, because in the legislative history

13

that we cite, they say -- and it's not true that all of

14

the -- separate taxable entity rules weren't implemented

15

until afterwards.

16

admittedly only with State and local taxes, they set up

rules, the same separate taxable entity rules that

this separate tax entity or at least in some people's

7

heads, but that idea had never been converted into any

8

statutory language.

9

should take this phrase "incurred by the estate" and

And you're suggesting that we

10

read it as if they were referring to something real that

11

was in a statute.

12

MR. SHAH:

It's not simply taking out of

13

their head, Your Honor; the section 346 rules which are

14

parallel and apply to State and local taxes, those

15

didn't come out of nowhere.

16

rulings as to when there is a separate taxable entity in

17

a bankruptcy case.

18

Those came out of prior IRS

There were pre-existing -- before the 1978

19

Act, in particular, there was a 1972 IRS revenue ruling

20

which set forth the rules about when there is a separate

21

taxable entity, whether the Act should -- whether the

22

tax should be taxed to the estate or to the debtor.

23

Section 346 in the 1978 Act codified those rules for

24

State and local income taxes.

25

In the intervening 2 years between 1978 and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

1980 when Congress consummated the step and extended

2

those to Federal taxes, the IRS was still applying its

3

pre-existing practice based on its revenue ruling.

4

there wasn't a gap where there was no guidance as to

5

whether -- how to determine whether these were incurred

6

by the estate or not.

7

So,

Courts may -- courts readily would have

8

looked, I presume, to the 1972 Treasury ruling and the

9

parallel 346 rulings in that gap time until the

10

legislative guidance came along and then codified that

11

result with respect to Federal taxes.

12

Now, I think to --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

Can I ask another

question --

15

MR. SHAH:

Sure.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- while we are on this?

17

Because the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we're looking

18

to this separate taxable entity, but if I understand

19

correctly, in the corporate context, the IRS actually

20

does not look to that.

21

22

It looks to just the question of

So, if that's the case, aren't you, in that

23

very large bankruptcy context, losing your textual

24

anchor entirely?

25

MR. SHAH:

No, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

There are two

Official

41

ways that a bankruptcy estate can incur a tax.

2

if it's a separate taxable entity, then it -- then it's

3

responsible for the taxes.

4

the estate, and it has to file the return and pay it.

5

One is

All the taxes are taxed to

The other way is if it has the duty to file

6

the return.

That's a different provision of the

7

Internal Revenue Code, section 6012(b)(3).

8

also appears in the Government's -- in the appendix to

9

the Government's brief.

6012(b)(3)

What 6012(b)(3) on page 14a

10

says is that, in a bankruptcy case, the trustee of a

11

corporate bankruptcy estate shall make the return for

12

income in a corporation.

13

What this Court held in Holywell, which both

14

sides cite and both sides agree, is that when a

15

corporate trustee has a duty to file a return under

16

6012(b)(3), it also has a duty to pay the tax.

17

it incurs -- it's liable for or incurs the tax.

18

That is,

So, there are two ways to incur the tax:

19

One is separate taxable entity; the other way is if the

20

code imposes an obligation on the bankruptcy estate

21

to -- to file and pay the tax return.

22

way to interpret it, and that's why all the chapter 7

23

24

inapt.

are, in fact, incurred by the estate.

That's the other

What's remarkable is that Petitioners do not

expense.

yet, there is not -- if this was such a big problem that

6

Congress was trying to get at it through this way, you

would have expected at least a single case in which a

treated it as an administrative expense or not, as long

as they all have to be paid anyway, you say?

15

MR. SHAH:

Sure.

So, the difference is, in

differently.

I know.

Let's imagine

They mean to treat them

6

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

They mean to treat the

postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government

9

not as an administrative expense.

But this is an

instance where the business will continue, and,

therefore, you have said in order to continue, you have

to pay all your tax liability and all your

administrative expenses.

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

that that same interpretation --

All of the taxes on

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in chapter --

chapter 13 cases are the ones that you -- that are

10

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, it is true that --

11

from the statistics that I have seen, on average we're

12

talking about 4 months in a chapter 13 case.

13

in -- in a chapter 12 case, according to the professors'

14

amicus brief, median time is about 8 months.

On average

15

What's clear from the legislative history,

16

the reason why Congress set up the chapter 13 rules as

17

to make the tax incurred by the debtor rather than by

18

the estate is because Congress expressly said in the

19

legislative history, which is cited in our brief, that

20

they expected the confirmation time to be relatively

21

quickly in a chapter 13 case.

22

We know that they made the same assumption

23

in the chapter 12 case because, one, they enacted the

24

same separate taxable entity rules; and, two, they put

25

in actual deadlines in the code for chapter 13:

Alderson Reporting Company

90 days

Official

50

to propose a plan, 45 days to confirm it.

2

4 months is what Congress had extended.

So, roughly

Now, in practice, it's been the case that

4

bankruptcy courts have extended that time beyond the

5

statutory deadlines.

6

months longer than what Congress had expected.

7

wasn't the intent that Congress had enacted this with,

8

and if Congress wants to change that, it can go back and

9

rewrite the rules to -- to make that change.

10

So, perhaps they are open a couple

15

20

effects.

21

expenses, whether they're included in the plan or not,

22

are still going to be paid up front.

23

Petitioners' reading that administrative expenses are

24

really part of the plan under 1222(a)(2), rather than

25

1226(b)(1), you now have a conflict between 1226(b)(1),

And the reason is this:

6

It said those will be paid "before

Now, if you also said that they come under

7

1222(a)(2), which is the only way that Petitioners could

win -- if they also came under 1222(a)(2), 1222(a)(2)

9

says that their -- they must be provided for full

14

15

So, deferred

That's very different than having them

So that -- that is one significant piece of

16

textual evidence that Congress thought that these should

17

be paid outside of the plan.

18

The other piece of textual evidence is

19

section 1227(a), which appears on page 10a as well, and

20

what it says is that the confirmed plan shall be binding

21

on each creditor.

22

category to the government.

That's the only potentially relevant

23

But section 101 defines "creditor" -- and

24

this is on page 1a of our appendix -- as "entity that

25

has a claim against a debtor that arose at the time of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

or before the order for relief concerning the debtor."

2

That is a holder of a prepetition claim.

3

If a confirmed chapter 12 plan is only

4

binding on the holder of a prepetition claim, it makes

5

no sense to include postpetition claims within a

6

chapter 12 plan.

7

to have a confirmed -- to have a plan included that and

8

not have that plan binding on the government.

9

I don't even know what it would mean

And so, I think if you take those two pieces

10

of textual evidence together, I think that strongly

11

supports the interpretation of 1222(a)(2) that when it

12

says a claim of the type specified in section 507, it

13

means "claim" and doesn't mean "claim and administrative

14

expense."

15

Now, admittedly, Congress has not been

16

perfectly clear in using that term.

It uses --

17

sometimes it uses the term "claim" to mean claim and

18

administrative expense.

19

mean claim.

20

distinction between claim and administrative expense in

light of section 1226(b)(1), which specifically already

addresses administrative expenses.

conclusion is that it includes a subset, a liability

"claim" in 507(a)(2) and 1226(b)(1) didn't exist, I

it to mean "claim and administrative expense."

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. FREEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MS. FREEMAN:

That's $29,000 in sale proceeds are property of

That's how bankruptcy cases work.

16

Because you have 1222(a)(2)(A), that $29,000

17

didn't need to be used to pay the taxes, and instead was

18

set aside to be treated under the plan of

19

reorganization, where that tax claim could be demoted in

20

priority to a prepetition claim and discharged.

21

But the ordinary course is that the sale

22

proceeds are used to pay the taxes, the administrative

23

expenses.

24

Government's argument here completely undercuts that.

25

That's how bankruptcy works.
