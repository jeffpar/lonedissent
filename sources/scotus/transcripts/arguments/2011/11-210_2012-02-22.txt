ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Military honors play a vital role in

12

inculcating and sustaining the core values of our

13

nation's armed forces.

14

criteria in awarding honors, and Congress has a long

15

tradition of legislating to protect the integrity of the

16

honors system.

17

The military applies exacting

The Stolen Valor Act continues that

18

tradition by prohibiting knowingly false statements that

19

one has been awarded a military honor.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, may I pose a

up a sign that says I won a Purple Heart -- for killing

3

babies.

4

During the Vietnam War, a protester holds

Knowing statement.

He didn't win the Purple

5

Heart.

As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and

6

is a combat veteran who opposes the war or whether he's

7

a citizen protesting the war.

8
9

Is that person -- if he's not a veteran
having received a medal, is he liable under this Act?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

I think, Your Honor, it

11

would depend on whether that was -- that expression was

12

reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of

13

fact or as an exercise in political theater.

14

the latter, it's not within the scope of the statute -­

If it's

you're advocating, I understand.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is what

Well, Your Honor -­
That there are no

circumstances in which this speech has value.

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, what -- what I

2

would say with respect to that, Your Honor, is that this

3

Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts,

4

that the calculated factual falsehood has no First

5

Amendment value for its own sake.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's not -­
Well, I'm -- I'm not sure

8

that that's quite correct.

It has said it often but

9

always in context where it is well understood that

10

speech can injure.

12

Sotomayor is indicating.

13

falsity.

14

Defamation, Gertz -- page 12 of your

You think there's no value to

But I -- I simply can't find that in our

15

cases, and I -- I think it's a sweeping proposition to

16

say that there's no value to falsity.

17

in which we contrast what is false and what is true.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Falsity is a way

I want to be -­
And -­
I want to respond with

21

precision, Justice Kennedy, that the -- I think what

22

this Court -- and Gertz is a good example -- has done is

23

to draw a line, and that line -- and I think it is Gertz

24

itself that contains this Court's statement that false

25

statements of fact have no First Amendment value.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official

1

doesn't automatically mean that a false statement of

2

fact lacks First Amendment protection.

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's in the context

of a defamation case.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
And you want to take the

7

Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation

8

is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that

9

the government can inveigh against what's false.

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The -- no, I'm trying to

11

say something much narrower than that, Justice Kennedy,

12

that, with respect to factually false statements, the

13

government has the authority, if it can meet the

14

"breathing space" principles that this Court's cases

15

have articulated, along with the recognition that

16

factually false statements have no intrinsic First

17

Amendment value.

18

they are substantial constraints that are satisfied in

19

this case because the Stolen Valor Act regulates a very

20

narrowly drawn and specific category of calculated

21

factual falsehood, a verifiably false claim that an

22

individual has won a military honor, and that's

23

information that is within you, and only punishes speech

24

about yourself.

25

the knowledge of the individual speaker.

Those are substantial constraints, but

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose,

2

General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and

3

Congress had said we don't like people saying that they

4

were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never

5

served for a single day in any armed force.

6

have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to

7

the false claim that one has served in the armed forces.

8
9

So, they

I don't see in your argument that there's
something special about the decorations.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

Well, I do think the

11

decorations matter, Justice Ginsburg.

12

that that kind of a statute would be a harder case and,

13

under the Court's "breathing space" principles, closer

14

to the line because the category is much broader, much

15

harder to define, and it would depend on the interest.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We -- we think

Why is it much harder to

17

define?

I don't -- why does the broadness have anything

18

to do with the breathing space?

19

argument here is that there is harm; it's not just

20

falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just

21

as libel is.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I do -- if I could get

20

back to Your Honor's point about the nature of the harm,

21

it is true that in Gertz you had the particularized

22

harm, but this Court -- the common characteristic that

23

allowed this Court to move from defamation to

24

false-light privacy, to intentional infliction of

25

emotional distress in the Falwell case, then to baseless
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawsuits, the sham exception in Noerr-Pennington, the

2

sham exception under the National Labor Relations Act,

3

the common characteristic was not an analogy to the

4

particularized harm that existed in defamation contexts.

5

The common characteristic that this Court's opinions

6

identify is the calculated factual falsehood.

7
8
9

It is true that the harm here is different.
It's a -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They were -- they were in

10

a context, though, of recognized torts, intentional

11

infliction for emotional distress.

12

me that you can argue that this is something like a -- a

13

trademark, a medal in which this -- the government and

14

the armed forces have a particular interest, and we

15

could carve out a narrow exception for that.

16

we'd have to do that.

Here it does seem to

I think

17

But just to say that the cases you mentioned

18

say that there's no value to false speech, I just simply

19

cannot agree that they stand for that broad proposition.

20

They do in the particular context of a recognized tort

21

like intentional infliction of emotional distress.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That -- that is true.

23

And this -- this is a case in which the -- one of the

24

harms that justifies this statute is the

25

misappropriation of the government-conferred honor and
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

esteem, and that is a real harm and a significant harm.

2

And there is also the particularized harm of the erosion

3

of the -- of the value of the military honors confirmed

4

-- conferred by our government; and those are

5

particularized harms that are real.

6

speech that this statute regulates are a genuine threat

7

to those harms in a way that, looking backwards, looking

13

spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases

14

that you cited in your brief defining the various

15

statutes that basically impose penalties for

16

impersonation of some sort or another.

17

every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either

18

an economic interest that was harmed by the

19

impersonation, either by the face of the -- by the very

20

face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a

21

dilution of a trademark by taking on someone else's

22

valuable property rights.

23

And virtually in

And so, I went back reading our cases, and

24

Justice Story many, many years ago said, look,

25

falsehoods have no value as such, but the "breathing

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think three

12

points.

13

response to Your Honor's question.

14

reality here is that, as I read this Court's cases, this

15

Court has never held or even suggested in any context

17

category of calculated factual falsehood, that it has to

way.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And that's why I want to

3

get to -- that's why -- but I think it's relevant, Your

4

Honor, to the point about Justice Story in the following

5

way:

6

U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 962, the impersonating a Federal

officer statute; 1001 being the false statement statute;

perjury statutes.

But not a -- as -- as I

saying is there is an additional category of

to the Stolen Valor Act, the -- Congress -- Congress is

And, of course, one of the reasons Congress

7

acted in 1923 to do that was out of concern that the

It is.

That's the

category that the statute regulates.

What's the principal reason

be covered.

question in that case of whether there was a material

risk of deterring expression that's truthful because

what -- who knows whether your grandfather was telling

the truth when he -- when he said he won the medal.

I think a

statute seeking to regulate that, Justice Ginsburg,

under the Court's "breathing space" analysis you

would -- you'd have to look long and hard and have

significant concerns about that kind of a -- a statement

controversy that -- that you'd want to exercise care,

19

and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political

20

candidates?

21

Would they come out the other end as constitutional?

22

How would your analysis apply to those?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think that those kinds

23

of statutes are going to have a lot harder time getting

24

through the Court's "breathing space" analysis because

25

the context in which they arise is one that would create

10

So, any demonstrable statement that a

candidate, political candidate, makes about himself.

Yes.

I think under the

claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was

2

someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal

3

to get money.

4

What I'm trying to get to is what harm are

5

we protecting here?

I thought that the core of the

6

First Amendment was to protect even against offensive

7

speech.

8

emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough.

9

If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear,

We have a legion of cases that said your

10

and that's what I think the court below said, is you

11

can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of

12

the medal that he or she received because someone's

13

claiming fraudulently that they got one.

think less of the medal.

15

that we're offended by the thought that someone's

claiming an honor they didn't receive.

We're reacting to the fact

we're suggesting is false statements -- false statements

deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to

so because it thought that the value of the awards that

I think if you

1

MR. LIBBY:

non-expressive purposes of wearing the medals.

6

MR. LIBBY:

If -- if there's -- if Congress

7

does not have a non-speech purpose for prohibiting the

wearing of the medals, then if it's strictly an

9

expressive purpose, then, yes, there would be a

10

significant First Amendment problem.

I can think of.

14

Well, don't you think

There's no non-expressive purpose that

16

with is strictly a content-based regulation on speech.

17

What I can say is in this case what we're dealing

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you -- you acknowledge

18

that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the

19

regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain

20

kinds of harms.

21

argument is determining which harms you think count and

22

which harms don't count.

23

And the problem I have with your

Would you go as far as was suggested earlier

5

MR. LIBBY:

So,

I believe -- what we believe the

6

right way of looking at this is you -- you determine

7

whether or not there is imminent harm or a significant

8

risk of imminent harm to an individual or to a

9

government function that would result from the speech.

10
11
12

When you say "imminent," you

mean -- what do you mean by that?
MR. LIBBY:

I guess I'm suggesting the

13

Brandenburg standard, which is -- if -­

14

15

standard, then most of the prosecutions for making false

16

statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not

17

going to survive, are they?

18

MR. LIBBY:

Well, but the issue is what

19

about the law.

And the issue with 1001 and those false

20

statement statutes is it's the substantial risk of

21

imminent harm to the government that could result from

22

the falsehood.

23

So -- well, certainly, it may not result in

harm is there.

I suppose I read the

13

Government's argument, it's that it's entitled to, at

14

most, limited protection.

15

start from the presumption that it's not fully protected

16

speech; whereas, of course, what we should be starting

17

with is the presumption that it is fully protected

speech unless this Court has previously said it's in one

of these historical categories of unprotected speech.

So, the Government seems to

So, I go back to Justice Alito's question

6

because you really haven't answered his question.

7

You've dealt with the government process cases, although

8

I -- we could argue about whether that's protecting a

9

process or protecting a government right to truthful

10

information.

That's a different issue.
But the question is how do you deal with the

intentional infliction of emotional distress?

what kind of injury.

definition.

Well, in the situation with

intentional infliction of emotional distress, you are

dealing with an instantaneous harm, a mental distress

there's imminent harm as a result of -- that results in

MR. LIBBY:

5

into the same category of -- of mental distress that we

look at in intentional infliction of emotional distress.

7

Certainly, people are entitled to be upset

by these false claims.

these false claims.

But the fact that there is a

10

certain level of upset doesn't mean that you were -­

you're harmed in the sense of the intentional infliction

of emotional stress tort.

13

with here is simply a non-instantaneous harm.

14

And so, what we're dealing

Now, what the Government has suggested is

15

that there's no harm that really results from a single

16

claim, that Mr. Alvarez's falsehood did not cause harm

17

to any individual.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It seems to me what you're

19

-- what you're arguing is that we should determine that

20

there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the

21

prohibition of a false statement and there are certain

22

harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what

23

judgment Congress made about the significance of those

harms.

Is that -- is that accurate?

Why not?

Because, after

all, we're willing to protect the Olympics Committee

9

when a false person saying he's the Olympics Committee

10

might deprive the Olympics Committee of a penny, while

11

here they're saying that to win this great medal, say,

12

the congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award in

13

the military the nation can give, you're deserving of

14

the most possible, grandest possible respect, and we

don't -- we don't even want you to have to think about

16

somebody having taken that name falsely; and so, we will

17

just criminalize it to discourage such activity that

18

undermines the very thought and purpose of giving the

to perform an overt act that asserts authority that the

make it not pure speech, to limit -- to wall off the
