ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If the individual mandate is

13

unconstitutional, then the rest of the Act cannot stand.

14

As Congress found and the Federal Government concedes,

15

the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions of

16

the Act cannot stand without the individual mandate.

17

Congress found that the individual mandate was essential

18

to their operation.

19

And not only can guaranteed issue and

20

community rating not stand, not operate in the manner

21

that Congress intended, they would actually counteract

22

Congress's basic goal of providing patient protection

23

but also affordable care.

24
25

You can -- if you do not have the individual
mandate to force people into the market, then community

rating and guaranteed issue will cause the cost of

2

premiums to skyrocket.

3

magnitude of that, but we can't debate that the

4

direction will be upward.

5

We can debate the order of

We also can't debate --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, that may well

6

be true.

7

that issue, and the figures vary from up 10 percent to

8

up 30.

9

findings.

10

The economists are going back and forth on

We're not in the habit of doing the legislative

What we do know is that for those States

11

that found prices increasing, that they found various

12

solutions to that.

13

may not say that it's unconstitutional -- Massachusetts

14

passed the mandatory coverage provision.

15

adjusted some of the other provisions.

16

In one instance -- and we might or

But others

Why shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in

17

fact the economists prove -- some of the economists

18

prove right that prices will spiral?

19

leaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should

20

be fixing this, not us?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

What's wrong with

Well, a couple of questions --

22

a couple of responses, Justice Sotomayor.

23

I think that it's very relevant here that Congress had

24

before it as examples some of the States that had tried

25

to impose guaranteed issue and community rating, and did
5
Alderson Reporting Company

First of all,

Official

1

not impose an individual mandate.

2

that model.

3

that it's not impossible to have guaranteed issue and

4

community rating without an individual mandate.

5

it's a model that Congress looked at and specifically

6

rejected.

7

And Congress rejected

So, your question is quite right in saying

But

And then, of course, there's Congress's own

8

finding, and their finding, of course -- this is finding

9

(i), which is 43a of the Government's brief, in the

10

appendix.

11

individual mandate is essential to the operation of

12

guaranteed issue and community rating.

13

Congress specifically found that having the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's all it said it

14

was essential to.

I mean, I'm looking at it.

The

15

exchanges.

16

gathering facilities that tell insurers what the various

17

policies actually mean.

18

cost saver in many of the States who have tried it.

19

why should we be striking down a cost saver --

The State exchanges are information-

And that has proven to be a

20

MR. CLEMENT:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So,

Well --- when, if what your

22

argument is -- was that Congress was concerned about

23

costs rising?

24

MR. CLEMENT:

Well --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why should we assume

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they wouldn't have passed an information --

2

MR. CLEMENT:

I think a couple of things.

3

One, you get -- I mean, I would think you'd sort of have

4

to take the bitter with the sweet.

5

if we're going to look at Congress's goal of providing

6

patient protection but also affordable care, we can't --

7

I don't think it works to just take the things that save

8

money and cut out the things that are going to make

9

premiums more expensive.

And if Congress --

But at a minimum --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

line, is why don't we let Congress fix it?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

I think on the bottom

Well, let me answer the bottom

13

line question, which is, no matter what you do in this

14

case, at some point there's going to be -- if you strike

15

down the mandate, there's going to be something for

16

Congress to do.

17

want to give Congress?

18

task of fixing the statute after something has been

19

taken out, especially a provision at the heart, or do

20

you want to give Congress the task of fixing health

21

care?

22

situation --

23

The question is really what task do you
Do you want to give Congress the

And I think it would be better in this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We're not taking -- if

24

we strike down one provision, we're not taking that

25

power away from Congress.

Congress could look at it
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

without the mandatory coverage provision and say this

2

model doesn't work; let's start from the beginning.

3

it could choose to fix what it has.

4

-- one portion doesn't force Congress into any path.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Or

We're not declaring

And, of course, that's right,

6

Justice Sotomayor, and no matter what you do here,

7

Congress will have the options available.

8

if you strike down only the individual mandate, Congress

9

could say the next day, well, that's the last thing we

So, if you --

10

ever wanted to do so we are going to strike down the

11

rest of the statute immediately and then try to fix the

12

problem.

So, whatever you do, Congress is going to have

13

options.

The question is --

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's such a thing as

legislative inertia, isn't there?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that's exactly --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean --

-- what I was going to say,

19

Justice Scalia, which is I think the question for this

20

Court is -- we all recognize there's legislative

21

inertia.

22

result in light of that reality?

23
24
25

And then the question is what's the best

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You are not suggesting

that we should take on more power to the Court?
MR. CLEMENT:

No, I -8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because Congress would

2

choose to take one path rather than another.

3

sort of taking onto the Court more power than one, I

4

think, would want.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

And I agree.

That's

We're simply

6

asking this Court to take on, straight on, the idea of

7

the basic remedial inquiry into severability which looks

8

to the intent of the Congress --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I wanted to ask you

10

about that.

11

look to the intent of the Congress?

12

know, sometimes Congress says that these provisions will

13

-- all the provisions of this Act will be severable, and

14

we ignore that when the Act really won't work, when the

15

remaining provisions just won't work.

16

square that reality with the proposition that what we're

17

looking for here is what would this Congress have

18

wanted?

19

Why do we look to the -- are you sure we

MR. CLEMENT:

I thought that, you

Now, how can you

Well, two responses,

20

Justice Scalia:

We can look at this Court's cases on

21

severability, and they all formulate the test a little

22

bit differently.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

Yes, they sure do.

But every one of them talks

about congressional intent.

But here's the -- there's

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the other answer --

2
3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's true, but is it

right?
MR. CLEMENT:

It is right.

And here's how I

5

would answer your question, which is, when Congress

6

includes a severability clause, it's addressing the

7

issue in the abstract.

8

provisions you strike down, we absolutely, positively

9

want what's left.

10

It doesn't say, no matter which

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

The consequence

11

of your proposition, would Congress have enacted it

12

without this provision, okay, that's the consequence.

13

That would mean that if we struck down nothing in this

14

legislation but the -- what is it called -- the "Corn

15

Husker kickback," okay, we find that to violate the

16

constitutional proscription of venality, okay?

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When we strike that down,

19

it's clear that Congress would not have passed it

20

without that.

21

last necessary vote in the Senate.

22

us that the whole statute would fall because the

23

Cornhusker kickback is bad.

24
25

It was -- it was the means of getting the

MR. CLEMENT:

And you're telling

That can't be right.

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

it can be, which is to say that the basic proposition,
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it's congressional intent that governs.

2

everybody on this Court has a slightly different way of

3

divining legislative intent.

4

one common ground among every member of this Court, as I

5

understand it, is you start with the text.

6

can agree with that.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now,

And I would suggest the

Everybody

So, Mr. Clement, let's start

8

with the text.

And you suggest, and I think that there

9

is -- this is right, that there is a textual basis for

10

saying that the guarantee-issue and the community-rating

11

provisions are tied to the mandate.

12

pointed to where that was in the findings.

13

And you -- you

Is there a textual basis for anything else?

14

Because I've been unable to find one.

It seems to me

15

that if you look at the text, the sharp dividing line is

16

between guarantee issue, community ratings, on the one

17

hand; everything else, on the other.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, I'd be

19

delighted to take you through my view of the text and

20

why there are other things that have to fall.

21

The first place I'd ask you to look is

22

Finding (J), which is on the same page, 43a.

23

read that, that's a finding that the individual mandate

24

is essential to the operation of the exchanges.

25

And as I

But there are other links between guaranteed
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issue and community rating and the exchanges.

2

there, I think, it's just the way that the exchanges are

3

supposed to work, and the text makes this clear, is

4

they're supposed to provide a market where people can

5

compare community-rated insurance.

6

the exchanges function.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

That's what makes

Although the exchanges

8

function perfectly well in Utah, where there is no

9

mandate.

They function differently, but they function.

10

And the question is always, does Congress want half a

11

loaf?

12

something like the exchanges, it seems to me a perfect

13

example where half a loaf is better than no loaf.

14

exchanges will do something.

15

that Congress envisioned.

16

Is half a loaf better than no loaf?

MR. CLEMENT:

And on

The

They won't do everything

Well, Justice Kagan, I think

17

there are situations where half a loaf is actually

18

worse, and I want to address that.

19

broadly -- but before I do that, if I can stick with

20

just the exchanges.

21

But before I -- more

I do think the question that this Court is

22

supposed to ask is not just whether they can limp along

23

and they can operate independently, but whether they

24

operate in the manner that Congress intended.

25

that's where I think the exchanges really fall down,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

because the vision of the exchanges was that if you got

2

out of this current situation where health insurance is

3

basically individualized priced based on individualized

4

underwriting and you provide community rating, then it's

5

going to be very easy for people to see, okay, well,

6

this is a silver policy, and this is a bronze policy,

7

and this is a gold policy.

8

can just pick which insurer provides what I think is

9

going to be the best service based on those comparable

10

And we can -- you know, I

provisions.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, you just said

12

something which you say a lot in your brief.

13

the question is the manner in which it would have

14

operated.

15

our cases.

16

Booker, where we decided not to sever provisions,

17

notwithstanding that the sentencing guidelines clearly

18

operate in a different manner now than they did when

19

Congress passed them.

20

than mandatory.

21

You say

And I think that that's not consistent with
And I guess the best example would be

They operate as advisory rather

MR. CLEMENT:

But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I

22

actually think Booker supports our point as well,

23

because there are two aspects of the remedial holding of

24

Booker.

25

actually very much supports our point is where the

And the first part of it, which I think

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

majority rejects the approach of the dissent, which

2

actually would have required nothing in the statute to

3

have been struck, not a single word.

4

But, nonetheless, this Court said, boy, if

5

you do that, then all of the sentencing is basically

6

going to be done by a combination of the juries and the

7

prosecutors, and the judges are going to be cut out.

8

And the Court said the one thing we know is that's not

9

the manner in which Congress thought that this should

10

operate.

11

Now, later they make a different judgment

12

about the -- which particular provisions to cut out.

13

But I do think Booker is consistent with this way of

14

looking at it.

15

the opinion that we rely on, because there the Court

16

only reached that part of the opinion after they had

17

already found that the must-hire provision operated

18

functionally independent from the legislative veto.

19

So --

20

It's certainly consistent with Brock,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, there are so

21

many things in this Act that are unquestionably okay.

I

22

think you would concede that reauthorizing -- what is it

23

-- the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, changes to

24

the Black Lung benefits.

25

I mean, it's a question of whether we say everything you

Why make Congress redo those?

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

did is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes,

2

there are many things in here that have nothing to do,

3

frankly, with the affordable health care, and there are

4

some that we think it's better to let Congress to decide

5

whether it wants them in or out.

6

So, why should we say it's a choice between

7

a wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting,

8

or a salvage job?

9

would be salvage rather than throwing out everything.

And the more conservative approach

MR. CLEMENT:

10

Well, Justice Ginsburg, two

11

kinds of responses to that:

One, I do think there are

12

some provisions that I would identify as being at the

13

periphery of this statute, and I'll admit that the case

14

for severing those is perhaps the strongest.
But I do think it's fundamentally different,

15
16

because if we were in here arguing that some provision

17

on the periphery of the statute, like the Biosimilars

18

Act or some of the provisions that you've mentioned, was

19

unconstitutional, I think you'd strike it down and you

20

wouldn't even think hard about severability.

21

What makes this different is that the

22

provisions that have constitutional difficulties or are

23

tied at the hip to those provisions that have the

24

constitutional difficulty are the very heart of this

25

Act.

And then if you look at how they are textually
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interconnected with the exchanges, which are then

2

connected to the tax credits, which are also connected

3

to the employer mandates, which is also connected to

4

some of the revenue offsets, which is also connected to

5

Medicaid, if you follow that through what you end up

6

with at the end of that process is just sort of a hollow

7

shell.

8

argument for not -- I mean, we can't possibly think that

9

Congress would have passed that hollow shell without the

10
11

And at that point, I think there is a strong

heart of the Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it would

12

have -- it would have passed parts of the hollow shell.

13

I mean, a lot of this is reauthorization of

14

appropriations that have been reauthorized for the

15

previous 5 or 10 years, and it was just more convenient

16

for Congress to throw it in, in the middle of the

17

2700 pages than to do it separately.

18

really suggest -- I mean, they cite the Black Lung

19

Benefits Act, and those have nothing to do with any of

20

the things we're talking about.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, can you

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you

22

know, they tried to make them germane.

23

to tell you that, you know -- some of their -- surely,

24

there are provisions that are just looking for the next

25

legislative vehicle that's going to make it across the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

But I'm not here

Official

1

finish line, and somebody's going to attach it to

2

anything that's moving.

I mean, I'll admit that.

3

But the question is -- when everything else

4

from the center of the Act is interconnected and has to

5

go, if you follow me that far, then the question is

6

would you keep this hollowed-out shell?

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Well, but it's not -But I'm still not sure,

what is the test -- and this was a colloquy you had with

10

Justice Scalia with the Cornhusker hypothetical.

I need

11

to know what standard you're asking me to apply.

Is it

12

whether as a rational matter the separate parts could

13

still function, or does it focus on the intent of the

14

Congress?

Now, we know that Congress

that's intrusive, so we ask whether or not an objective

2

-- as an objective rational matter, one could function

3

without -- I still don't know what the test is that

4

we're supposed to apply.

And this is the same question

5

as Justice Scalia asked.

Could you give me some help on

6

that?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

Justice Kennedy, the

8

reality is I think this Court's opinions have at various

9

times applied both strains of the analysis.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

And which one -- and what

11

test do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify

12

our jurisprudence?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm -- I'm a big believer in

14

objective tests, Justice Kennedy.

15

happy with you to apply a more textually based objective

16

approach.

17

more inclined to take more of a peek at legislative

18

history, and I think if you look at the legislative

19

history of this, it would only fortify the conclusion

20

that you would reach from a very objective textual

21

inquiry.

22

objective textual inquiry --

25

I'd be perfectly

I don't

understand -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that objective test is

Alderson Reporting Company

what?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

It is whether the statute can

3

operate in the manner that Congress -- that Congress

4

intended.

5

And -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No statute can do that,

6

because once we chop off a piece of it, by definition,

7

it's not the statute Congress passed.

8

something more than that.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

So, it has to be

Justice Sotomayor, every one

10

of your cases, if you have a formulation for

11

severability, if you interpret it woodenly, it becomes

tautological.

14

he says:

15

doesn't operate exactly in the manner because it doesn't

16

have all the pieces, but you still make an inquiry as to

17

whether -- I mean, when Congress links two provisions

18

together and one really won't work without the other --

19

And Justice Blackmun addressed this in

Of course, it's not just -- you know, it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, what is wrong with

20

the presumption that our law says, which is we presume

21

MR. CLEMENT:

I think in fairness, though,

20

Justice Sotomayor, to get to the point you're wanting to

21

get to, you'd have to ratchet up that presumption a

22

couple of ticks on the scale, but -- and because the one

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, one thing that's wrong

2

with that, which is still at a smaller level, is that's

3

inconsistent with virtually every statement in every one

4

of your severability opinions, which all talk about

5

congressional intent.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

with our practice, right, Mr. Clement?

8

to go back decades and decades and decades, and I'm not

9

sure even then you could find a piece of legislation

Well, it's not inconsistent
I mean, you have

that we refused to sever for this reason.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think that's right,

12

Justice Kagan.

I mean, I think there are more recent

13

examples.

14

and maybe is a segue to get to my broader point, is a

15

case that involves a State statute, not a Federal

16

statute, but I don't think anything turns on that, is

17

Randall v. Sorrell, where this Court struck down various

18

provisions of the Vermont campaign finance law.

19

there were other contribution provisions that were not

20

touched by the theory that the Court used to strike down

21

the contribution limits.

22

the opinion said, you know, there's no way to think that

23

the Vermont legislator would have wanted these handful

24

of provisions there on the contribution side.

25

strike down the whole thing.

A great example I think, which sort of proves

But

But this Court at the end of

1

And if I could make the broader point, I

2

mean, I think the reason it makes sense in a democracy

3

with separation of powers to in some cases sever the

4

whole thing is because sometimes a half a loaf is worse.

5

And a great example, if I dare say so, is Buckley.

6

Buckley this Court looked at a statute that tried to, in

7

a coherent way, strike down limits on contributions and

8

closely related expenditures.

9

In

This Court struck down the ban on

10

expenditures, left the contribution ban in place, and

11

for four decades Congress has tried to fix what's left

12

of the statute, largely unsuccessfully; whereas it would

13

have I think worked much better from a democratic and

14

separation of powers standpoint if the Court would have

15

said:

16

expenditures under the Constitution.

17

provision is joined at the hip.

3

all kinds of stuff in there.

4

word of that, I promise.

I mean, as you pointed out, there's biosimilarity,

doctors to serve underserved areas, there's the CLASS

know if you differ very much.

So, what do you propose that we do other

17

than spend a year reading all this and have you argue

18

all of it?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

What I would propose

20

is the following, Justice Breyer, is you follow the

21

argument this far and then you ask yourself whether what

22

you have left is a hollowed-out shell or whether you

23

have --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would say the Breast

Feeding Act, the -- getting doctors to serve underserved

areas, the biosimilar thing and drug regulation, the

2

CLASS Act -- those have nothing to do with the stuff

3

that we've been talking about yesterday and the day

4

before, okay?

5

So, if you tell me at that level, I'd say,

6

sure, they have nothing to do with it; they could stand

on their own.

nothing to do with it.

So, that's -- you know what you have there?

12

A total off-the-cuff impression.

13

asking you what should I do?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

So, that's why I'm

What you should do is let me

15

say the following, which is follow me this far, which is

16

the mandatory, individual mandate is tied, as the

17

Government suggests, to guaranteed issue and community

18

rating, but the individual mandate, guaranteed issue,

19

and community rating together are the heart of this Act.

20

They -- they're what make the exchanges work.

21

The exchanges in turn are critical to the

22

tax credits, because the amount of the tax credit is key

23

to the amount of the policy price on the exchange.

24

exchanges are also key to the employer mandate, because

25

the employer mandate becomes imposed on an employer if
24
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

one of the employees gets insurance on the exchanges.

2

But it doesn't stop there.

Look at the

3

Medicare provision for DSH hospitals, okay?

4

hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of the

5

needy.

6

that you had in your other hand.

7

without the mandate, community rating, and guaranteed

8

issue.

This isn't in Title I.

JUSTICE ALITO:

These are

It's in the other part
But it doesn't work

Well, can I ask you this,

Mr. Clement?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Sure.
If -- what would your

13

fallback position be if we don't accept the proposition

14

that if the mandate is declared unconstitutional, the

15

rest of the Act, every single provision, has to fall?

16

Other proposed -- other dispositions have been proposed.

17

There's the Solicitor General's disposition, the

18

recommended disposition to strike down the

19

guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions.

20

of the -- one amicus says strike down all of Title I;

21

another says strike down all of Title I and Title II.

22

What -- what would you suggest?

23

MR. CLEMENT:

One

Well, I -- I think what I

24

would suggest, Justice Alito -- I don't want to be

25

unresponsive -- is that you sort of follow the argument
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

through and figure out what in the core of the Act

2

falls.

3

left is a hollowed-out shell, you could just leave that

4

standing.

And then I guess my fallback would be if what's

5

If you want a sort of practical answer, I

6

mean, I do think you could just -- you know, you could

7

use Justice Breyer's off-the-cuff as a starting point

8

and basically say, you know, Title I and a handful of

9

related provisions that are very closely related to that

10

are really the heart of the Act.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

doesn't --

point.

we've struck the heart of this Act; let's just give

22

Congress a clean slate.

23

other big volume get re-enacted, they can do it in a

24

couple of days.

because it's very --

If it's not,

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, but -- I mean, you can

3

laugh at me if you want, but the point is I rather

4

suspect that it won't be easy.

5

that if you actually dug into that, there'd be something

6

that was quite controversial in there and couldn't be

7

passed quickly --

Because I rather suspect

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. CLEMENT:

10

But the reality --

-- and that's our whole point.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The reality of the

11

passage -- I mean, this was a piece of legislation

12

which, there was -- had to be a concerted effort to

13

gather enough votes so that it could be passed.

14

suspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions

15

that Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the

16

price of a vote:

17

provision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages.

18

in the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it.

19

That's why all -- many of these provisions,

And I

Put in the Indian health care

I think, were put in, not because they were

21

unobjectionable.

22

have done is they wouldn't have been able to put

23

together, cobble together the votes to get it through.

24
25

So, presumably, what Congress would

MR. CLEMENT:
Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, maybe that's right,

And I don't want to, I mean, spend
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all my time on -- fighting over the periphery, because I

2

do think there are some provisions that I think you

3

would make, as an exercise of your own judgment, the

4

judgment that once you've gotten rid of the core

5

provisions of this Act, that you would then decide to

6

let the periphery fall with it.

7

But if you want to keep the periphery,

8

that's fine.

What I think is important, though, as to

9

the core provisions of the Act, which aren't just the

10

mandate, community rating, and guaranteed issue, but

11

include the exchanges, the tax credit, Medicare, and

12

Medicaid -- as to all of that, I think you do want to

13

strike it all down to avoid a redux of Buckley.

If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21
22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There should be no occasion for the Court in

23

this case to consider issues of severability, because,

24

as we argue, the -- the minimum coverage provision is

25

fully consistent with Article I of the Constitution.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

1

But if the Court were to conclude otherwise, it should

2

reject Petitioners' sweeping proposition that the entire

3

Act must fall if this one provision is held

4

unconstitutional.

5

As an initial matter, we believe the Court

6

should not even consider that question.

7

majority of the provisions of this Act do not even apply

8

to the Petitioners, but instead apply to millions of

9

citizens and businesses who are not before the Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

The vast

How does your

11

proposal actually work?

Your idea is that, well, they

12

can take care of it themselves later.

13

contemplate them bringing litigation and saying -- I

14

guess the insurers would be the most obvious ones --

15

without -- without the mandate, the whole thing falls

16

apart, and we're going to bear a greater cost, and so

17

the rest of the law should be struck down.

I mean, do you

18

And that's a whole other line of litigation?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- I think the

20

continuing validity of any particular provision would

21

arise in litigation that would otherwise arise under

22

that provision by parties who are actually --

action is it?

of action.

But what cause of

I've never heard of a severability cause

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, in the first place, I

5

issues, one of the things this Act does is change

6

Medicare reimbursement rates.

review procedure for that.

Mr. Kneedler, there are

some provisions which nobody would have standing to

challenge.

15

Federal money, it doesn't hurt anybody except the

16

taxpayer, but the taxpayer doesn't have standing.

17

-- that just continues.

18

-- it is so closely allied to what's been struck down

19

that it ought to go as well.

to continue because there's nobody in the world that can

21

challenge it.

If the provision is simply an expenditure of

That

Even though it is -- it should

But, nonetheless, that has

22

Can that possibly be the law?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that proves our

24

point, Justice Scalia.

This Court has repeatedly said

25

that just because there's -- no one may have standing to
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

challenge -- and particularly like tax credits or taxes

2

which are challenged only after going through the

3

Anti-Injunction Act, just because no one has standing

4

doesn't mean someone must.

5

But beyond that --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But those are provisions

7

that have been legitimately enacted.

The whole issue

8

here is whether these related provisions have been

9

legitimately enacted or whether they are so closely

10

allied to one that has been held to be unconstitutional

11

that they also have not been legitimately enacted.

12

You can't compare that to -- to cases

13

dealing with a statute that nobody denies is -- is

14

constitutional.
MR. KNEEDLER:

15

This case is directly

16

parallel to the Printz case, in our view.

17

the Court struck down several provisions of the Brady

18

Act but went on to say it had no business addressing the

19

severability of other provisions that did not apply to

20

the people before the Court.

What he's thinking of is

purpose X, which will pay for half of purpose X.

second half is unconstitutional.

Purpose X can't

Does the government just sit there

collecting half the money forever because nobody can

ever challenge it?

won't consider that because maybe somebody else could

11

bring that case and then there is no one else?

Severability --

15

Mr. Kneedler, it's not a

16

choice between someone else bringing the case and a law

17

staying in place.

18

as Justice Sotomayor started this discussion, is who is

19

the proper party to take out what isn't infected by the

20

Court's holding?

21

may be no standing, one institution clearly does have

22

standing, and that's Congress.

And what we're really talking about,

With all these provisions where there

2

Court say we're going to wreck the whole thing, or

3

should the Court leave it to Congress?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

leave it to Congress for two reasons.

6

I'm making now about justiciability, or whether the

the minimum coverage provision.

When you say "judicial

down other provisions of the Act.

14

might be quite the opposite.

judicial power, if one Act was -- one provision was

stricken and the others remained, to impose a risk on

insurance companies that Congress had never intended.

It is in Congress's findings

that the -- that the minimum coverage provision --

without it, the Court -- the Congress said, in Finding

provisions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well --

May I ask you about the

3

argument that's made in the economists' amicus brief?

4

They say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs

5

of roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry and

6

that these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350

7

billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and

8

350 billion from the Medicaid expansion.

9

Now, if the 350 billion -- maybe you'll

10

disagree with the numbers, that they're fundamentally

11

wrong.

12

the 350 million from the individual mandate were to be

13

lost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which

14

would now be in the -- in the hole for $350 billion over

15

10 years?

16

But assuming that they're in the ballpark, if

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't -- I mean, first of

17

all, for the Court to go beyond text and legislative

18

history to try to figure out how the finances of a bill

19

operated, it's like being the budget committee.

20

but we think the economists had added up the figures

21

wrong.

22

and the insurance companies are involved in that,

23

they're going to be reimbursed for the --

24
25

But --

If there's Medicaid expansion, the insurance --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
isn't Medicaid expansion?

But what if there

We've talked about the
42

individual mandate, but does the Government have a

2

position on what should happen if the Medicaid expansion

3

is struck down?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

We don't -- we don't think

5

that that would have any effect.

6

addressed in the next argument.

7

would have any effect on the -- on the rest of the -- on

8

the rest of the Act.

9

And that could be
But we don't think that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, it -- the

10

Government's position is that if Medicaid expansion is

11

struck down, the rest of the Act can operate --

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- without it.

It's -- in the past,

15

Congress has expanded Medicaid coverage without there

16

being -- it's done it many times without there being a

minimum coverage provision.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I still don't

understand where you are with the answer to

Justice Alito's question.

Assume that there is a -- a substantial

22

probability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals

7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate

24

is stricken.

Assume there is a significant possibility

that kind of risk?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Can we

Well, we don't think it's in

5

the Court's place to look at the -- at the budgetary

6

implications, and we also --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But isn't that -- isn't

8

that the point, then, why we should just assume that it

9

is not severable?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we -- if we lack the

12

competence to even assess whether there is a risk, then

13

isn't this an awesome exercise of judicial power?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I don't --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

To say we're doing

16

something and we're not telling you what the

17

consequences might be?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I don't think so, because

19

when you -- when you're talking about monetary

20

consequences, you're looking through the Act, you're

21

looking behind the Act, rather than -- the Court's

22

function is to look at the text and structure of the Act

23

and what the substantive provisions of the Act

24

themselves mean.

25

And if I could go past --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Kneedler, could I --

44
Alderson Reporting Company

can you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this

2

one in which we are asked to strike down what the other

3

side says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in --

4

as you request, leave in effect the rest of it?

5

ever -- most of our severability cases, you know,

6

involve one little aspect of the Act, and the question

7

is whether the rest.

8

down what was the main purpose of the Act and left the

9

rest in effect?

When have we ever really struck

Do you have a case for that?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Have we

provisions were central to the Act, but the -- but the

Court said Congress would have preferred a statute

guidelines remained.

17

In Booker, the mandatory sentencing

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the reason -- the

reason the majority said that was that they didn't think

that what was essential to the Act was what had been

stricken down, and that is the -- the ability of the

would be.

And you're saying you've never found an instance
46
Alderson Reporting Company

where they're all struck out when they have nothing to

2

do with each other.

3

My question is -- because I hear Mr. Clement

4

saying something not too different from what you say.

5

He talks about things at the periphery.

6

or accept an argument on severability because it's a lot

7

of work for us.

think that it's possible for you and Mr. Clement -- I'm

9

exploring this -- to get together and agree on --

That's beside the point.

We can't reject

10

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But do you

-- I mean, on a list of

12

things that are, in both your opinions, peripheral?

For

All of that was

24

based on the assumption that the mandate was

25

constitutional.

And if -- that certainly doesn't stop
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

us from reaching our own determination on that.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but what I'm saying is

3

it's a question of legislative intent, and we have a

4

very fundamental indication of legislative intent that

5

it -- that Congress did not mean the whole Act to fall

6

if -- without the minimum coverage provision, because we

7

have many provisions that are operating now without

8

that.

9

But there's a further indication about why

10

the line should be drawn where I've suggested, which is

11

the package of these particular provisions.

12

other provisions of the Act would continue to advance

13

Congress's goal, as the test that was articulated in

14

Booker, but it's been said in Regan and other cases.

15

You look to whether the other provisions can continue to

16

advance the purposes of the Act.

All of the

17

Here they unquestionably can.

18

health -- the broad public health purposes of the Act

19

that are unrelated to the minimum coverage provision but

20

also the other provisions designed to enhance affordable

21

-- access to affordable care:

22

responsibility provision, the credit for small

23

businesses, which is already in effect, by the way, and

24

affecting many small businesses.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The public

The employer

That --

But many people might

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not -- many of the people in Congress might not have

2

voted for those provisions if the central part of this

3

statute was not adopted.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

But that --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, you know, you're --

6

to say that we're effectuating the intent of Congress is

7

just unrealistic.

8

who knows, who knows which of them were really desired

9

by Congress on their own and which ones weren't?

10

Once you've cut the guts out of it,

MR. KNEEDLER:

The question for the Court

11

is, Congress having passed the law by whatever majority

12

there might be in one house or the other, Congress

13

having passed the law, what at that point is -- is the

14

legislative intent embodied in the law Congress has

15

actually passed?

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's right.

17

But the problem is, straight from the title, we have two

18

complementary purposes, patient protection and

19

affordable care.

20

say this promotes affordable care; therefore, it's

21

consistent with Congress's intent.

22

a balanced intent.

23

and say this promotes patient protection without asking

24

if it's affordable.

25

And you can't look at something and

Because Congress had

You can't look at another provision

So, it seems to me if you ask what is going
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to promote Congress's purpose, that's just an inquiry

2

that you can't carry out.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I -- with respect, I

4

disagree, because I think it's evident that Congress's

5

purpose was to expand access to affordable care.

6

it in discrete ways.

7

employers that don't -- that don't offer suitable care.

8

It did it by offering tax credits to small employers.

9

It did it by offering tax credits to purchasers.

It did

It did it by the penalty on

10

those are a variety of ways that continue to further

Congress's goal.

12

which is unrelated to -- to the private insurance market

13

altogether.

14

And most of all, Medicaid, which is --

And in adopting those other provisions

15

governing employers and whatnot, Congress built on its

16

prior experience of using the tax code, which it has --

17

for a long period of time, Congress has subsidized the

18

provision of health care --

provision requiring employers to purchase insurance or

pay a tax penalty.

No, I -- I think it's -- any

cost assumptions -- there's no indication that Congress

10

made any cost assumptions, but -- but there's no reason

11

to think that the individual -- that the individual

12

market, which is where the minimum coverage provision is

13

directed, would affect that.

14

I would like to say -- I have pointed out

15

why the other things would advance Congress's goal.

point here is that the package of three things would be

contrary -- would run contrary to Congress's goal if you

took out the minimum coverage provision.

will make matters worse.

-- there will be less -- fewer people covered in the

25

If you take out minimum coverage but

Well, if that is true, what

Alderson Reporting Company

1

is the difference between guaranteed-issue and

2

community-rating provisions, on the one hand, and other

3

provisions that increase costs substantially for

4

insurance companies?

5

6

plans, which the economists' amicus brief said will cost

7

$217 billion over 10 years?

8
9

insurance companies.

participants in the market for Medicaid and -- and other

12

things.

25

financial balance sheet, which doesn't appear anywhere

together.

5

6

and it's not just the text of the Act, but the

7

background of the Act, the experience in the States, the

8

testimony of the National Association of Insurance

9

Commissioners.

10

That's the -- that's the problem Congress

11

was addressing.

There was a -- there was -- a shifting

12

of present actuarial risks in that market that Congress

13

wanted to correct.

14

provision out and left the other two provisions in,

15

there would be laid on top of the existing shifting of

16

present actuarial risks an additional one because the

17

uninsured would know that they would have guaranteed

18

access to insurance whenever they became sick.

make the -- it would make the adverse selection in that

market problem even worse.

It would

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III,

Alderson Reporting Company

What

AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the outset, I would just like to say I

5

think that the Government's position in this case that

6

the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions

7

ought to be struck down is an example of the best

8

driving out the good, because, even without the minimum

9

coverage provision, those two provisions, guaranteed

10

issue and community rating, will still open insurance

11

markets to millions of people that were excluded under

12

the prior system and for millions of people will lower

13

prices, which were raised high under the old system

14

because of their poor health.

15

So, even though the system is not going to

16

work precisely as Congress wanted, it would certainly

17

serve central goals that Congress had of expanding

18

coverage for people who were unable to get coverage or

19

unable to get it at affordable prices.

20

So, when the government --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One of the points that

22

Mr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable

23

because the -- he spoke of the adverse selection

24

problem, that there would be so fewer people in there,

25

the insurance companies are going to have to raise the
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

premiums.
So, it's nice that Congress made it possible

3

for more people to be covered, but the reality is they

4

won't because they won't be able to afford the premium.

5
6
7

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me

say two things about that.
First of all, when we talk about premiums

8

becoming less affordable, it's very important to keep in

9

mind different groups of people, because it is not

10

something that applies accurately to everybody.

11

For people who were not able to get

12

insurance before, obviously, their insurance beforehand

13

was -- the price was essentially infinite.

14

not able to get it at any price.

15

to get it at a price that they can afford.

16

They were

They will now be able

For people who are unhealthy and were able

17

to get insurance, but perhaps not for the things that

18

they were most concerned about, or only at very high

19

rates, their rates will be lower under the system, even

20

without the minimum coverage provision.

21
22
23
24
25

Also, you have a large number of people who,
under the Act -JUSTICE SCALIA:
say -- I didn't follow that.
MR. FARR:

Excuse me.
Why?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would their rates be

lower?

3

MR. FARR:

Their rates are going to be lower

4

than they were under the prior system because they are

5

going into a pool of people, rather than -- some of whom

6

are healthy, rather than having their rates set

7

according to their individual health characteristics.

8

That's why their rates were so high.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the problem, Mr. Farr,

10

isn't it, that they're going to a pool of people that

11

will gradually get older and unhealthier.

12

way the thing works.

13

companies have to cover all of the sick people and all

14

of the old people, the -- the rates climb.

15

more young people and healthy people say why should we

16

participate; we can just get it later when we get sick.

17

So, they leave the market.

More people leave the market.

The rates go up further.
And the whole system

Well, that's -And this is not --

24

do I know?

It's just what -- what's reflected in

25

Congress's findings, that it's -- it looks at some
59
Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official

1

States and says this system crashed and burned.

2

looked at another State with the minimum coverage

3

provision and said this one seems to work; so, we'll

4

package the minimum coverage provision with the

5

nondiscrimination provisions.

6

MR. FARR:

It

Well, in a moment, I'd like to

7

talk about the finding, but if I could just postpone

8

that for a second and talk about adverse selection

9

itself.
I think one of the misconceptions here,

10
11

Justice Kagan, is that Congress, having seen the

12

experience of the States in the '90s with community

13

rating and guaranteed issue, simply imposed the minimum

14

coverage provision as a possible way of dealing with

15

that, and if you don't have the minimum coverage

16

provision, then, essentially, adverse selection runs

17

rampant.

18

But that's not what happened.
Congress included at least half a dozen

19

other provisions to deal with adverse selection caused

20

by bringing in people who are less healthy into the Act.

21

There are -- to begin with, the Act

22

authorizes annual enrollment periods so people can't

23

just show up at the hospital.

24

sign up at the right time, they at least have to wait to

25

the -- to the time next year.

If they don't show up and

That's authorized by the

60

Act.

2

There -- with respect to the subsidies,

3

there are three different things that make this

4

important.

5

generous.

6

poverty line, the subsidy will cover 80 percent, on

7

average, of the premium, which makes it attractive to

8

them to join.

9

First of all, the subsidies are very
For people below 200 percent of the Federal

The structure of the subsidies, because

10

their income -- they create a floor for -- based on the

11

income of the person getting the insurance, and then the

12

government covers everything over that.

13

important in adverse selection because if you do have a

14

change in the mix of people and average premiums start

15

to rise, the government picks up the increase in the

16

premium.

17

insured contributes remains constant at a percentage of

18

his or her income.

And this is

The amount that the person who is getting

19

And the third thing --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is nothing about

21

Federal support that is unsustainable, right?

22

infinite.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. FARR:

25

That is

Well, I mean, that's a fair

point, Justice Scalia, although one of the things that
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

happens, if you take the mandate out, while it is true

2

that the subsidies that the government provides to any

3

individual will increase, and they will be less

4

efficient -- I'm not disputing that point -- actually,

5

the overall amount of the subsidies that the government

6

will provide will decline, as the Government notes

7

itself in its brief, because there will be fewer people

8

getting them.

9

even though they're getting subsidies.

Some people will opt out of the system

But I'd just like to go back for one more

10
11

second to the point about how the subsidies are part of

12

what Congress was using, because the other thing is that

13

for people below 250 percent of the Federal poverty

14

line, Congress also picks up and subsidizes the

15

out-of-pocket costs, raising the actuarial value.

16

So, you have all of that, and then you have

17

Congress also, unlike the States, establishing -- or I

18

should be precisely accurate -- unlike almost all the

19

States, establishing an age differential of up to three

20

to one.

21

selling a 25-year-old a policy for $4,000 can charge a

22

60-year-old $12,000 for exactly the same coverage.

23

So, an insurance company, for example, that is

The States typically in the '90s, when they

24

were instituting these programs, they either had pure

25

community rating, where everybody is charged the same
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

premium -- everybody regardless of their age is charged

2

the same premium.

3

to 1.

4

subsidies, but their age band was two to one.

Some States had a variance of 1.5

Massachusetts, for example, which did have good

5

So, when Congress is enacting this Act, it's

6

not simply looking at the States and thinking:

7

that didn't go very well.

8

coverage provision?

9
10

Well,

Why don't we put in a minimum

That will solve the problem.

Congress did a lot of different things to
try to combat the adverse selection.

11

Now, if I could turn to the finding, because

12

I think this is the crux of the Government's position,

13

and then the plaintiffs pick up on that and then move --

14

move from that to the rest of the Act.

15

me, quite honestly, it's an important part because that

16

is textual.

17

what we're trying to figure out, the finding seems to

18

stand out as something that the Court can rely on and

19

say here's something Congress has actually told us.

20

And it seems to

You know, in this whole sort of quest for

But I think the real problem with the

21

finding is the -- the context in which Congress made it.

22

It's quite clear.

23

finding is on page 42 -- 43a, excuse me, of the

24

Solicitor General's severability brief, in the appendix.

25

If the Court wants to look, the

But the finding is made specifically in the
63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

context of interstate commerce.

That is why the

2

findings are in the Act at all.

Congress wanted to

3

indicate to the Court, knowing that the minimum coverage

4

provision was going to be challenged, wanted to indicate

5

to the Court the basis on which it believed it had the

6

power under the Commerce Clause to enact this law.

7

Why does that make a difference with respect

8

to Finding (I), which is the one that the Government is

9

relying on, and in particular the last sentence, which

10

says this requirement "is essential to creating

11

effective health insurance markets" in which guaranteed

12

issue and pre-existing illnesses can be covered.

13

And the reason is because the word

14

"essential" in the Commerce Clause context doesn't have

15

the colloquial meaning.

16

"essential" effectively means useful.

17

says -- in Lopez, when the Court says section 922(q) is

18

not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme of

19

economic activity, it goes on to say:

20

regulatory scheme would be undercut if we didn't have

21

this provision.

22

In the Commerce Clause context,
So that when one

In which the

Well, if that's all Congress means, I agree

with that.

It doesn't mean, as the Court has said on

numerous occasions, absolutely necessary.

3

conducive to, useful, advancing the objectives,

4

advancing the aims.

5

that's what Congress did.

6
7

And it's easy to see, I think, that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. FARR:

9

"essential"?

11

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.
-- that definition of

Is there any dictionary

14

MR. FARR:

Well -- but I think my point,

15

Justice Scalia, is that they're not using it in the true

16

dictionary sense.

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do we know that?

When

people speak, I assume they're speaking English.

19

MR. FARR:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. FARR:

Well --

I think that there are several

22

reasons that I would suggest that we would know that

23

from.

24

Congress says at the very beginning -- the head of it is

25

Congress makes the following findings.

The first is, as I say, the findings themselves.

65
Alderson Reporting Company

And they're

Official

1

talking about the interstate -- you know, (B) is headed

2

"Effects on the national economy and interstate

3

commerce."

4

talking about.

5

Court's Commerce Clause statement.

6

So, we know the context that Congress is
It is more or less quoting from the

But if one looks at the very preceding

7

finding, which is Finding (H), which is on 42 over onto

8

43, Congress at that point also uses the word

9

"essential."

In the second sentence, it says this

10

requirement -- and again, we're talking about the

11

minimum coverage provision -- "is an essential part of

12

this larger regulation of economic activity," which is,

13

by the way, an exact quote from Lopez, in which "the

14

absence of the requirement would undercut Federal

15

regulation," also an exact quote from Lopez.

16

But what it's referring to is essential --

17

an essential part of ERISA, the National Health Service

18

Act, and the Affordable Care Act.

19

even the plaintiffs haven't argued, that those acts

20

would all fall in their entirety if you took out the

21

minimum coverage provision.

22

It can't possibly be,

And as a second example of the same usage by

23

Congress, the statute that was before the Court in

24

Raich, section 801 of Title 21, the Court said that the

25

regulation of intrastate drug activity, drug traffic,
66
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was essential to the regulation of interstate drug

2

activity.

3

Congress was saying one is so indispensable to the

4

other, the way the United States uses the term here, so

5

indispensable that if we can't regulate the intrastate

6

traffic, we don't want to regulate the interstate

7

traffic, either.

8

traffic would fall.

9

Again, it is simply not conceivable that

The whole law criminalizing drug

So, I think once you look at the finding for

10

what I believe it says, which is we believe this is a

11

useful part of our regulatory scheme, which the Congress

12

would think in its own approach would be sufficient --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. FARR:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel --

Yes, Justice.
The problem I have is

16

that you're ignoring the congressional findings and all

17

of the evidence Congress had before it that community

18

ratings and guaranteed issuance would be a death

19

spiral -- I think that was the word that was used --

20

without minimum coverage.

21

materials that are part of the legislative record here.

22

Those are all of the

So, even if it might not be because of the

23

structure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence.

24

should we be looking at that as opposed to what Congress

25

had before it and use "essential" in its plain meaning:
67
Alderson Reporting Company

Why

Official

arguing, community ratings and guaranteed issue.

3

can't have those two without minimum coverage.

4

MR. FARR:

You

Well, I think that's a fair

5

question.

6

before Congress only led to the idea that if -- that you

7

would have death spirals seems to me to be contradicted

8

a little bit at least by the CBO report in November of

9

2009, which is about 4 months before the Act passed,

10

But the idea that -- that all the information

where the CBO talks about adverse selection.

11

Now, I want to be clear.

This is at a time

12

when the minimum coverage provision was in the statute.

13

So, I'm not suggesting that this is a discussion without

14

that in it.

15

talks about adverse selection and -- and points out the

16

different provisions in the Act, the ones I have

17

mentioned plus one other, actually, where in the first 3

18

years of the operation of the exchanges, those insurance

19

companies that get sort of a worse selection of -- of

20

consumers will be given essentially credits from

21

insurance companies that get better selection.

22

But, nonetheless, the CBO goes through and

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

Now, I -- I

12

agree that there's a risk and the significance of it

13

people can debate.

14

that question -- and I didn't mean to be whimsical about

15

it.

16

on the other side, which is the fact that if you follow

17

the Government's suggestion, if the Court follows the

18

Government's suggestion, what is going to be lost is

19

something we know is a central part of the Act.

20

indeed, if one sort of looks at the legislative history

21

more broadly, I think much of it is directed toward the

22

idea that guaranteed issue and community rating were the

23

crown jewel of the Act.

24
25

But what I think is -- is lost in

I think what is lost in it a little bit is what's

I mean,

The minimum coverage provision wasn't
something that everybody was bragging about.
69
Alderson Reporting Company

It was

1

something that was meant to be part of this package.

2

agree with that.

3

But the -- but the point of it was to have

4

guaranteed issue and minimum coverage.

5

me -- guaranteed issue and community rating.

6

-- under the Government's proposal, those would

7

disappear.

8
9

I

I mean -- excuse
And that's

We would go back to the old system.
And under what I think is the proper

severability analysis, the -- the real question the

10

Court is asking, should be asking, is, would Congress

11

rather go back to the old system than to take perhaps

12

the risk that you're talking about, Justice Kennedy?

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

referring to the Government's second position.

15

first, of course, is that we shouldn't address this

16

issue at all.

17

MR. FARR:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you're
Their

That's correct.
I asked Mr. Kneedler

19

about what procedure or process would be anticipated for

20

people who are affected by the change in -- in the law

21

and the change in the economic consequences.

Do you

22

have a view on how that could be played out?

It does

23

seem to me that if we accept your position, something --

24

there have to -- there has to be a broad range of

25

consequences, whether it's additional legislation,
70
Alderson Reporting Company

additional litigation.

2
3

Any thoughts on how that's going to play
out?

4

MR. FARR:

Well, if the Court adopts the

5

position that I'm advocating, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

6

what would happen is that the Court would say that the

7

minimum coverage provision, by hypothesis of course, is

8

unconstitutional, and the fact of that being

9

unconstitutional does not mean the invalidation of any

10

other provision.

11

So, under the position I'm advocating, there

12

would no longer be challenges to the remaining part of

13

the Act.

14

The -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if the challenge

15

is what we're questioning today, whether -- if you're an

16

insurance company and you don't believe that you can

17

give the coverage in the way Congress mandated it

18

without the individual mandate, what -- what type of

19

action do you bring in court?
MR. FARR:

20

You -- if the Court follows the

21

course that I'm advocating, you do not bring an action

22

in court.

24

struck down by the Court:

25

4

that States have adjusted their systems as they've gone

5

along, as they've seen things work or not work.

6

You know, as I was talking earlier about the

7

-- the different ratio for ages in insurance.

8

States have tended to change that because they found

9

that having too narrow a band worked against the

10

effectiveness of their programs.

11

in Massachusetts, they didn't enact mandates.

12

The

But they -- except for

So, to answer -- I think to answer your

13

question directly, Mr. Chief Justice, the position I'm

14

advocating would simply have those -- those pleas go to

15

Congress, not in court.

16

Now, if one -- just to discuss the issue

17

more generally, if that's helpful, I think that if there

18

were situations where the Court deferred -- let's say

19

for discretionary reasons, they just said -- the Court

20

said we're not going to take up the question of

21

severability and therefore not resolve it in these other

22

situations, it certainly seems to me that in enforcement

23

actions, for example, if the time comes in 2014 and

24

somebody applies to an insurance company for a

25

policy and the insurance company says, well, we're not
72
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to issue a policy, we don't think your risks are

2

ones that we're willing to cover -- it seems to me that

3

they could sue the insurance company and the insurance

4

company could raise as a defense that this provision,

5

the guaranteed-issue provision of the statute, is not

6

enforceable because it was inseverable from the decision

7

-- from the provision that the Court held

8

unconstitutional in 2012.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

system comes tumbling down, or else enacting a Federal

Do you really think that that is somehow

2

showing deference to Congress and respecting the

3

democratic process?

4
5

It seems to me it's a gross distortion of
it.

6

MR. FARR:

Well, Your Honor, the difficulty

7

is that it seems to me the other possibility is for the

8

Court to make choices particularly based on what it

9

expects the difficulties of Congress altering the

10

legislation after a Court ruling would be.

11

aware of any severability decision that has ever looked

12

anything like that.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not

No, I -- that wouldn't be

14

my approach.

My approach would say, if you take the

15

heart out of the statute, the statute's gone.

16

enables Congress to do what it wants in the usual

17

fashion.

18

saying:

19

is bad.

And it doesn't inject us into the process of
This is good, this is bad, this is good, this

20

MR. FARR:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

That

Well -It seems to me it reduces

our options the most and increases Congress's the most.
MR. FARR:

And I guess to some extent I have

24

to quarrel with the premise, Justice Scalia, because at

25

least the position that I'm advocating today, under
74
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which the Court would only take out the minimum coverage

2

provision, I don't think would fit the description that

3

you have given of taking out the heart of the statute.

4

Now, I do think once you take out guaranteed

5

issue and community rating, you're getting closer to the

6

heart of the statute.

7

difficulties I think with the Government's position is

8

that I think it's harder to cabin that, to draw that

9

bright line around it.

10

And one of the -- one of the

It's harder than the Government

thinks it is.

11

I mean, to begin with, even the Government

12

seems to acknowledge, I think, that the exchanges are

13

going to be relatively pale relatives of the exchanges

14

as they're intended to be, where you're going to have

15

standardized products, everybody can come and make

16

comparisons based on products that look more or less the

17

same.

18

But the other thing that's going to happen

19

is with the subsidy program.

The way that the subsidy

20

program is set up, the subsidy is calculated according

21

to essentially a benchmark plan.

22

if the Court wants to look at the provisions, they're --

23

they begin at page 64a of the private plaintiffs' brief.

24

Again, in the appendix.

The particular provision I'm

25

talking about's at 68a.

But there's a -- there's a

And this -- if one --

75
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question -- you -- you're looking essentially to

2

calculate the premium by looking at a -- at a

3

standardized silver plan.

4

First question, obviously, is:

Is there

5

going to be any such plan if you don't have guaranteed

6

issue and community rating, if the plans can basically

7

be individualized?

8

the provision on 68a, the -- the provision that's used

9

for calculating the subsidy, what -- what is anticipated

But the second problem is that, in

10

in the provision under the Act, as it is now, is that

11

you do have the floor of the income.

12

would take this benchmark plan, and the government would

13

pay the difference.

14

You would -- you

And as we talked about earlier, the

15

benchmark plan can change for age, and -- and the

16

provision says it can be adjusted only for age.

17

in fact you even have such a thing as a benchmark plan

18

anymore, if the rates of people in poor health go up

19

because of individual insurance underwriting, the

20

government subsidy is not going to pay for that.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, if

Mr. Farr, I understood that

22

the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia was

23

essentially that the minimum coverage provision was not

24

the heart of the Act.

25

provision was a tool to make the nondiscrimination

Instead, the minimum coverage

76
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provisions -- community rating, guaranteed issue --

2

work.

3

So, if you assume that, that all the minimum

4

coverage is, is a tool to make those provisions work,

5

then I guess I would refocus Justice Scalia's question

6

and say, if we know that something is just a tool to

7

make other provisions work, shouldn't that be the case

8

in which those other provisions are severed along with

9

the tool?
MR. FARR:

10

No, I don't think so, because

11

there are -- there are many other tools to make the same

12

things work.

13

That's I think the point.
And if one -- and the case that comes to

14

mind is New York v. The United States, where the Court

15

struck down the "take title" provision but left other --

16

two other incentives essentially in place.

17

Even without the minimum coverage provision,

18

there will be a lot of other incentives still to bring

19

younger people into the market and to keep them in the

20

market.

21

correct -- and that's all that Congress is saying, that

22

this would be useful -- it doesn't mean that it's

23

impossible to have --

24
25

And if -- if my reading of the finding is

JUSTICE BREYER:

But would you -- I'd just

like to hear before you leave your argument, if you want
77
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to, against what Justice Scalia just said.

Let's

2

assume, contrary to what you want, that the Government's

3

position is accepted by the majority of this Court.

4

so, we now are rid, quote, of the true "heart" of the

5

bill.

6

here like the Indian Act, the black lung disease, the

7

wellness program, that restaurants have to have a

8

calorie count of major menus, et cetera.

And

Now, still there are a lot of other provisions

9

Now, some of them cost money, and some of

10

them don't.

11

your argument that just because the heart of the bill is

12

gone, that has nothing to do with the validity of these

13

other provisions, both those that cost money or at least

14

those that cost no money?

15

argument in that respect, that destroying the heart of

16

the bill does not blow up the entire bill; it blows up

17

the heart of a bill?

18

have to say about that.

19

And there are loads of them.

MR. FARR:

Now, what is

Do you want to make an

And I'd just like to hear what you

Well, Justice Breyer, I think

20

what I would say is, if one goes back to the -- what I

21

think is the proper severability standard and say, would

22

Congress rather have not -- no bill as opposed to the

23

bill with whatever is severed from it, it seems to me

24

when you're talking about provisions that don't have

25

anything to do with the minimum coverage provision,
78
Alderson Reporting Company

1

there's no reason to answer that question as any other

2

way than yes, Congress would want these provisions.

Well -You know -- you only have

14

two choices, Congress.

15

you can have -- you can have parts of the bill or no

16

bill at all.

17

You can have the whole bill or

Why that false choice?
MR. FARR:

I think the reason is because

18

severability is by necessity a blunt tool.

19

doesn't have -- even if it had the inclination, doesn't

20

essentially have the authority to retool the statute --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Oh, I know.

22

-- I would say stay out of politics.

23

Congress, not us.

24

MR. FARR:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Court

So, you

That's for

Right.
But the -- the question

79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have

2

you ever found a severability case where the Court ever

3

said:

4

therefore, we strike down these other provisions that

5

have nothing to do with it, which could stand on their

6

feet independently and can be funded separately or don't

7

require money at all.

8

MR. FARR:

9

Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and,

I think the accurate answer would

be I am not aware of a modern case that says that.

I

10

think there probably are cases in the '20s and '30s that

11

would be more like that.

12

If I could just take one second to address

13

the economists' brief because Justice Alito raised it

14

earlier.

15

aside the whole balancing thing, if one looks at the

16

economists' brief, I think it's very important to note

17

that when they're talking about one side of the balance

18

-- may I finish?

I just want to make one simple point.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FARR:

Certainly.

When they're talking about the

21

balance, they're not just talking about the minimum

22

coverage provision.

23

the minimum coverage provision and the subsidy programs.

24

And then, so when you're doing the mathematical

25

balancing, the subsidy programs are extremely large.

They very carefully word it to say

80

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Farr.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, could you

10

respond to amici's point?

He says that Congress didn't

11

go into this Act to impose minimum coverage.

12

into the Act to have a different purpose, i.e., to get

13

people coverage when they needed it, to increase

14

coverage for people, that this is only a tool.

15

other States -- going back to my original point, that

16

there are other tools besides minimum coverage that

17

Congress can achieve the same goals.

18

just a tool, why should we strike the whole Act --

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

They went

But

So, if we strike

Mr. Chief --- when Congress has

other tools available?
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'll make

23

four points in rebuttal, but I'll start with Justice

24

Sotomayor's question, which is to simply say this isn't

25

just a tool; it's the principal tool.
81
Alderson Reporting Company

Congress

Official

1

identified it as an essential tool.

2

tool to make it work.

3

4

characterization; that's Congress's characterization in

5

Sub-finding (I) on page 43a of the Government's brief.

6

It's not just a

It's a tool to pay for it, to
And, again, that's not my

Now, that brings me to my first point in

7

rebuttal, which is Mr. Kneedler says, quite correctly --

8

tells this Court don't look at the budgetary

9

implications.

Well, the problem with that, though, is

10

once it's common ground that the individual mandate is

11

in the statute at least in part to make community rating

12

and guaranteed issue affordable, that really is all you

13

have to identify.

14

that it's there to pay for it.

That establishes the essential link

You don't have to figure out exactly how

15
16

much that is and which box -- I mean, it clearly is a

17

substantial part of it, because what they were trying to

18

do was take healthy individuals and put them into the

19

risk pool -- and this is quoting their finding -- which

20

is in order -- they put people into the market, which

21

will lower premiums.

22

So, that's what their intent was.

So, you don't have to get to the final

23

number.

24

that's reason alone to sever it.

25

You know that's what was going on here, and

Now, the Government -- Mr. Kneedler also
82
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says there's an easy dividing line between what they

2

want to keep and what they want to dish out.

3

problem with that is that, you know, you read their

4

brief and you might think, oh, there's a

5

guaranteed-issue and a community-rating provision

6

subtitle in the bill.

7

The

There's not.

To figure out what they're talking about you

8

have to go to page 6 of their brief, of their opening

9

severability brief, where they tell you what's in and

10

what's out.

11

actually between 300g(a)(1) and 300g(a)(2), because on

12

community rating, they don't -- they say that (a)(1)

13

goes, but then they say (a)(2) has to stay because

14

that's the way that you'll have some sort of -- kind of

15

Potemkin community rating for the exchanges.

16

actually look at those provisions, (a)(2) makes all

17

these references to (a)(1).

18

And the easy dividing line they suggest is

But if you

It just doesn't work.

Now, in getting back to the -- an inquiry

19

that I think this Court actually can approach is, to

20

look at what Congress was trying to do, you need look no

21

further than the title of this statute: Patient

22

Protection and Affordable Care.

23

that community rating and guaranteed issue were the

24

crown jewels of this Act.

25

provide patient protection.

I agree with Mr. Farr

They were what was trying to
And what made it

83
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

affordable?

2

guaranteed issue, community rating, and the individual

3

mandate, there is nothing left to the heart of the Act.

4

The individual mandate.

If you strike down

And that takes me to my last point, which is

5

simply this Court in Buckley created a halfway house,

6

and it took Congress 40 years to try to deal with the

7

situation, when contrary to any time of their intent,

8

they had to try to figure out what are we going to do

9

when we're stuck with this ban on contributions, but we

10

can't get at expenditures because the Court told us we

11

couldn't.

12

house.

13

And for 40 years, they worked in that halfway

Why make them do that in health care?

The

14

choice is to give Congress the task of fixing this

15

statute, the residuum of this statute after some of it

16

is struck down, or giving them the task of simply fixing

17

the problem on a clean slate.

18

close choice.

19

unconstitutional, the rest of the Act should fall.

22

If the individual mandate is
