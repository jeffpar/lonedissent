ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether it is

12

fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act

13

that Congress revoked the district court jurisdiction to

14

declare acts of Congress unconstitutional in actions

15

brought by Federal employees.

16

several reasons.

17

The answer is no, for

First, the Civil Service Reform Act doesn't

18

say that it precludes section 1331 jurisdiction.

19

Congress could have said so.

20

And there's no inference of preclusion of the

21

Petitioners' claims that's fairly discernible from the

22

scheme itself.

23

constitutionality of statutes are just not the type of

24

claims that are reviewed through the CSRA scheme.

25

Congress didn't say so.

And that's because challenges to

Because of this, the Merit Systems

Protection Board dismisses challenge -- challenges to

2

constitutionality of a statute routinely as outside of

3

its authority.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MR. SCHWARTZ:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Schwartz -Yes.
-- suppose an employee is

7

fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims,

8

constitutional and statutory.

9

happens then?

What would you think

Does he bring the constitutional claims

10

in one court but the statutory claims in another

11

court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission?

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

No, Your Honor.

I believe

13

that, because of normal rules against splitting of

14

claims, the employee would have to make a decision.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that seems just as

16

bad.

In other words, that then, you -- it's not

17

inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the

18

employee to choose between her constitutional claims and

19

her statutory claims.

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is correct.
Why would we do that?
Because of the importance of

23

making the constitutional claims available in -- in a --

24

for judicial review.

25

options that the employee would have to weigh.

That is -- that's just one of the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would you make

2

that concession?

3

for an employee to choose?

4

constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps

5

that employee could take advantage of the review scheme

6

that's outlined by the Government.

7

where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the

8

employee would have the option of bringing the claim in

9

one of the district courts.

10

Why wouldn't it be possible in that --

MR. SCHWARTZ:

If the employee had both

But in the situation

That -- that certainly is a

11

possibility, Your Honor.

12

that the employee could bring his constitutional claim

13

in the district court and still pursue his statutory

14

claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board.

15

However, I'd like to point out that, while this is an

16

interesting hypothetical, we don't have to look at

17

hypotheticals in this situation because we have in the

18

Third Circuit since 1986 and in the District of Columbia

19

Circuit since 1995 -- those two circuits permit Federal

20

employees to bring their constitutional claims in the

21

circuit court.

22

And -- and it is a possibility

We were unable to find a single instance in

23

which there has been one of these mixed claims of a -- a

24

constitutional claim and a statutory claim brought in

25

those circuits.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In -- in those cases, did

2

the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional

3

claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit?

5

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We -- we were unable to -- to

find any example of -- of that happening.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well, that's -- that's

7

the problem here.

8

constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose

9

would work.

10

I mean, yes, if all you have is a

You go to the district court.

But where --

where you have both, it's a problem.

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I -- and I -- I agree that

12

that is a more difficult situation.

13

situation presented by the facts of this case at least.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's not the

You suggested that it's a

15

situation that doesn't often arise, and I guess that

16

puzzles me.

17

Why wouldn't it often arise?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

I don't know why it doesn't

18

often arise.

It -- it might be that -- that people

19

prefer to leave their claims in the Merit Systems

20

Protection Board.

And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -Counsel, do you --- what would happen if --

24

if the employee is fired because of his or her religion

25

and he goes to MSPB?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this is a First

Amendment claim.

4

adequate cause, and -- and then they find something else

in the statute?

aspect of the claim?

7

MSPB has to say, well, this is not

It can't look at the constitutional

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Your Honor, if -- if an

8

employee is fired because of his religion, there's --

9

there's a -- a separate procedure for discrimination

10

claims such as could be brought under Title VII -- and,

11

in fact, those claims do go directly to the district

court.

I'll -- I'll retract

my "no" then.

11
12

Okay.

Or -- I'm -- I

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Honor.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not any constitutional

19

have a right to go to the district court.

on?

2

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

I am drawing a

3

distinction between a challenge to the constitutionality

4

of a statute, as the Petitioners are doing here, and

5

that is beyond the -- the authority of the Merit

6

Systems --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you talking about a

8

facial challenge to the statute as -- and am I

9

understanding you right?

A facial challenge goes to the

10

district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge

11

goes to the commission?

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

And -- and that --

13

that's the procedure.

14

cases are bread-and-butter cases at the Merit Systems

15

Protection Board now.

16

because I wrote a letter to the editor that my boss

17

didn't like, he's not challenging the constitutional --

18

The as-applied challenge -- those

If somebody says I was fired

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I -- I was leading up

19

to the fact, why should there be a difference?

20

MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it

21

have it for facial?

22

is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong

23

about that?

24
25

If the

I mean, the expertise question

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I would -- with due

respect, I -- I disagree with you, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

10
1

expertise required to decide the present Petitioners'

2

claim and the letter to the editor claim is totally

3

different.

4

concern the facts of the workplace, what was my boss's

5

motivation, what were his actual reasons for firing me.

6

In the letter to the editor claim, the facts

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, and whether that

7

reason was justifiable.

And isn't it the case that

8

whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you

9

would have an as-applied challenge, right?

10

MR. SCHWARTZ:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
So, why do you need a

12

facial challenge in addition?

13

try to do as-applied first and facial second.

14

isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems

15

Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying

16

that this action was wrong and not allowed under the

17

statute?

18

was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the

19

problem?

20

I thought that we always
So, why

And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Justice Scalia, I -- I agree

21

that in the as-applied challenge where somebody says my

22

rights were violated, that case now goes and should go

23

to the Merit Systems Protection Board.

case, there's no challenge to the application of a

25

statute.

In the present

There's no challenge to any decision that was

decision made by Congress --

The challenge is to the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, that is the

rule --

5

MR. SCHWARTZ:

-- in enacting the Civil --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the rule that

7

you would apply across the board so long -- only in the

8

case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the

9

district court?

If it's an as-applied -- this law was

10

unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before

11

the MSPB?

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

any different than the administrative system and review

can't, but the reviewing court can.

language of both cases.

Both cases said even if the

13

agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there's

14

still review within the Federal Circuit -- within the --

15

within the circuit courts, and that's okay.

16

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why isn't that okay

here?

19

20

won't have a record.

21

wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to

develop it.

23

I think that was Justice Scalia's question to
I know that you say, well, the Federal Circuit
But the Government says if it

So, what's wrong with that procedure?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

The first thing that's

24

wrong -- that's wrong with that procedure as it would be

25

applied to this case is that it's -- it's a vast

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

departure from the Civil Service Reform Act scheme as it

2

was created by Congress; and -- and -- because that

3

scheme involves the Merit Systems Protection Board

4

acting as a trial court; and -- and giving the first

5

level of review and in effect substituting for the --

6

for a district court.

7

And then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't one of the

8

challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was

9

constructively discharged?

Isn't that an issue that the

10

board is better suited to determine in the first

11

instance, whether there was at all a constructive

12

discharge?

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, in fact, it's -- it's

14

just the reverse of that, where that one Petitioner

15

would be taking the position that he was not

16

constructively discharged.

17

discharged, the Merit Systems Protection Board arguably

18

would have jurisdiction.

19

under the Government's theory, he would be among the

20

class of Federal employees -- constitutes about a third

21

of Federal employees -- who have no appellate rights to

22

the Merit Systems Protection Board.

23

If he was constructively

If he voluntarily resigned,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your position

24

was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we

25

have no authority to adjudicate constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

questions, period.

2

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, I thought that the

4

court was saying this claim is dismissed because we

5

don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of

6

question.

7

well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction

8

over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said

9

it didn't have authority to render the decision?

And then your next -- the Federal Circuit --

10

MR. SCHWARTZ:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12
13

Yes.
I thought that that's

what your position was.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is what our position is,

14

and -- and it leaves open the question of just what the

15

Federal Circuit is going to do after the Merit Systems

16

Protection Board has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's not your

18

position, as I understood it, in your response to my

19

earlier question.

20

to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented

21

to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the

22

Federal Circuit.

23

You said that the -- it is all right

MR. SCHWARTZ:

My position is that if the

24

MSPB has jurisdiction to find a statute -- that since

25

the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to find a statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

unconstitutional, any claim in which the employee is

2

asking for them to find a statute unconstitutional is

3

one that is outside of the CSRA scheme.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay, but -- but

5

within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim

6

that this statute is, while not facially

7

unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me --

8

Where does that go?

9
10

MR. SCHWARTZ:

apologize for my confusion about --

11
12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I would defer to you,

Your Honor.

15

(Laughter.)

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

I think it's

probably mine.

13
14

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

Where does -- where

does -- where does that claim go?

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

My confusion is about the use

19

of the term "as applied."

20

terms such as "facial" or "as applied" where the

21

dividing line can be somewhat blurry, I propose drawing

22

the dividing line between a case where the employee is

23

saying this statute is unconstitutional; I'm saying

24

Congress made a mistake --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I -- rather than using

Well, why wouldn't the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent

2

with your argument.

3

the MSPB itself could decide the claim.

The dividing line should be where

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
If the MSPB can decide the

6

claim, then it goes to the MSPB.

7

decide the claim, I think is what you're saying, then

8

it has to go to the district court.

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If the MSPB can't

Yes.
And you're saying that the

11

MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide,

12

cases where he says, you know, my -- my supervisor fired

13

me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the

14

scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which

15

is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional

16

full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's

17

authority.

18

Is that right?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, that's absolutely

19

correct.

And -- and the cases that would not be within

20

the MSPB's authority would include cases where the

21

employee says the statute is unconstitutional and would

22

also include the million or so Federal employees who, as

23

the Government says, have no appellate rights to the

24

MSPB, all -- all of those persons, career -- those

25

persons would include summer interns, FBI employees.

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, what type --

summer interns and FBI employees?

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

The --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I assume that's for

5

very different reasons -- one because they are summer

6

interns, and, you know, if they are impermissibly

7

treated, it's kind of -- they're summer interns.

8

There's no reason to get --

9

(Laughter.)

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't -- I

11

don't mean that facetiously.

12

saying is that there's some level of de minimis

13

personnel actions when you're talking about the vast

14

Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give,

15

you know, the whole panoply of rights.

16

I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they

17

deal with.

18

I mean, what they're

And FBI agents,

So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want

19

us to focus on the millions of employees who would now

20

be going to district court or do you want us to focus on

21

the small number that have facial constitutional

22

challenges?

23

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, actually, Your Honor,

24

it's the Government that is taking the position that the

25

summer interns, the FBI agents, all the government

attorneys, Federal Government chaplains, who have no

2

right to appeal to the MSPB -- all of those persons, the

3

to the district court.

5

Can bring their constitutional claims

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And why is that wrong?

It

6

seems to me that's what the -- what the Administrative

7

Procedure Act says, that if there is no other effective

8

means of judicial review, you get judicial review under

9

the APA.

10

MR. SCHWARTZ:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -These people have no

effective right because they can't go to the MSPB and

13

can't go to the Federal Circuit.

14

15

problem.

16

So, they have -- they
That's not a

The problem is the people who do have rights

17

to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, who

18

have constitutional claims based on -- on the

19

unconstitutionality of a statute?

20
21

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I -- I disagree with

that, Justice Scalia.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Why?
Because the -- the summer

24

intern, the FBI agent, the nonpreference employee, the

25

excepted service employees, unless they -- they have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

claim that they can take to the Merit Systems Protection

2

Board, they're precluded from going to any other court.

3

They're precluded under the Administrative Procedures

Act.

5

Court's Fausto decision, a Federal employee who could

6

not bring a case -- his appeal to the Merit Systems

7

Protection Board tried to bring a Back Pay Act claim in

8

the Court of Claims and this court said, no, that is

9

precluded.

That's this Court's Fausto decision.

10

And in this

And what the Government is doing is saying

11

you got a right in Fausto, but for constitutional

12

claims, Mr. Fausto had it right.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that's -- that's

14

entirely logical.

Fausto in effect said that the

15

statutory structure simply provides no cause of action

16

for these people, okay?

17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
They're not entitled to

19

anything.

20

the -- in the civil service laws that say these people

21

are not entitled to constitutional protections.

22

You're going further.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That is absolutely correct.

And -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, in your original briefs,

5

Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear

a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit.

back and said that's not the case.

Circuit could hear the claim as a matter -- you know, on

14

the -- at the -- at the first level?

15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I agree that a system can be

16

proposed to get these claims to the Federal Circuit.

17

However, it's not the system of the -- that Congress

18

created in the Civil Service Reform Act.

19

significance of the contortions that have to be gone

demonstrates that it's not fairly discernible from the

that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has

There's nothing to review because the MSPB said

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's how it would work in

5

the real world.

I mean, what is -- what is the Federal

Circuit supposed to do?

dismissal, and now we'll move on to the merits.

that's not the way that appellate courts normally

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

and may it please the Court:

2

I'd like to begin if I could by addressing the

3

question asked by Justice Kagan, which is why shouldn't

4

the scope of the MSPB's authority be the test for

5

determining whether a claim can be filed in district

6

court?

7

And I think using that as the test would

8

lead to unclear and easily manipulated jurisdictional

9

rules.

Among other things, it often won't be clear up

10

front whether the MSPB can resolve an employee's claim

11

or not.

12

challenge a statute's constitutionality might be

13

resolved, for instance, by interpreting the statute to

14

avoid the constitutional question, which is something

15

that the MSPB could do.

16

A claim that appears at first blush to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We could just ask the

17

MSPB, Mr. Feigin.

18

and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to

19

adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a

20

world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that

21

you can go to the district court.

22

If you bring the claim to the MSPB,

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I don't think that's

23

consistent with the CSRA, Your Honor, because the way

24

the CSRA works is that you go to the MSPB first, and

25

then you go to the Federal Circuit.

Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official

everyone agrees that the Federal -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but the CSRA is

presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something.
MR. FEIGIN:

I don't think it's presuming

that any more than 42 U.S.C. 405(g) was presuming that

6

in Illinois Council or the Mine Act was presuming that

7

in Thunder Basin Coal.

8

to have constitutional claims presented to an agency in

9

the first instance, even if the agency can't resolve

10

those claims, because it allows the agency to figure

11

out -- for example, in the case that this Court was

12

discussing with Mr. Schwartz about circumstances where

13

there might be nonconstitutional claims and

14

constitutional claims, the agency might be able to moot

15

out the case on nonconstitutional grounds.

22

MR. FEIGIN:

There is no such

That was true in Illinois

13

We prefer Thunder Basin, Your

Honor.

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MR. FEIGIN:

Yes, I imagine so.

Your Honor, I think, as we

21

suggest in our brief, McNary actually presented a very

22

specialized circumstance in several respects.

23

all, there was a special statutory provision in that

24

case that limited judicial review of -- in that case, to

25

the record that had already been developed, and that's

Alderson Reporting Company

First of

Official

32
1

not true here.

2

Second, the Court was very concerned in

3

McNary that if the plaintiffs weren't allowed to bring

4

their claims in district court, they wouldn't be able to

5

receive any meaningful judicial review at all.

6

Now, here, the plaintiffs in this case can

7

get meaningful judicial review from the Federal Circuit,

8

which everyone agrees has the authority to resolve a

9

constitutional challenge to a statute.

10

Now, if I could, I'd like to address I think

11

some confusion, as the Chief Justice was noting, over

12

the meaning of the term "jurisdiction" and exactly what

13

would happen if the Petitioners had brought this case in

14

the first instance to the MSPB.

15

Now, before getting into this, I'd like to

16

acknowledge that when Petitioner Elgin did bring this

17

case to the MSPB, the government argued that the MSPB

18

had no jurisdiction.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Please finish with your

answer.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

And let me now address what

14

should have happened when the case went to the MSPB.

15

The MSPB would have had jurisdiction over the case in

16

the sense that the challenge to the adverse action is

17

properly before the MSPB.

18

under 5 U.S.C. 7513(d) and 5 U.S.C. 7701(a), which grant

19

the MSPB jurisdiction over adverse actions under the

20

CSRA.

21

I think that's very clear

Now, the MSPB would not be able to

adjudicate the constitutionality, would not be able to

have this volume of evidence about what's happening in

13

the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional

14

issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

the only thing that we think the MSPB lacks authority to

find facts with regard to this claim?

When did the government back away from that

separate out two things.

position that the MSPB has no authority to declare a

20

Federal statute unconstitutional.

21

was taking the position that in cases where an employee

22

had been removed pursuant to a statutory bar, that the

23

MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of -- of a

24

case like that.

25

First, it is still our

because the MSPB lacked authority to decide the

2

constitutionality of a statute, although we believe

3

that, too, but because the government was arguing

4

erroneously that an employee who is removed based on a

5

statutory bar that should have prevented his hiring in

6

the first place wasn't an employee within the meaning of

in the court of appeals and in this Court, and,

Now the government no longer takes that
We've been consistent on that

10

therefore, we believe that the MSPB did properly have

11

jurisdiction over the action in this case.

12

Now, when it goes up to the MSPB, the MS --

13

and after -- the MSPB would then deny relief on the

14

merits because it would lack the authority to declare a

15

Federal statute unconstitutional.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't want to delay you;

17

so, don't pause too long.

18

where did this rule -- is there a statute or something

19

that says an agency can't say that this action would be

20

unconstitutional?

21

But I've just been curious --

Where does that idea come from?

MR. FEIGIN:

So, there is not a statute,

22

Your Honor.

This Court has said in several cases that

23

administrative agencies generally lack the authority to

24

declare a statute unconstitutional.

25

Thunder Basin that that isn't a constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

It's clear from

Official

39
1

limitation on the authority of Federal agencies.

2

is to say, if Congress wanted to give an agency the

3

authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of a

4

statute, it could.

5

Commission in Thunder Basin believed it did have the

6

authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of

7

statutes, although the Court didn't reach whether the

8

Mine Commission was correct about that.

9

That

And the Court noted that the Mine

And in this case, the MSPB believes,

10

consistent with this Court's repeated statements, that

11

it lacks authority to adjudicate the constitutionality

12

of statutes.

13

Now, if the Court decides that the best way

14

to reconcile this scheme would simply be to say that the

15

MSPB does have the authority to adjudicate the

16

constitutionality of statutes, I think that would make

17

much more sense than the position the Petitioners are

18

urging.

19

illustrates why the position the Petitioners are urging

20

will lead to confusion of jurisdictional rules and

21

manipulation of jurisdictional rules.

22

And here's an example, I think, that

So, if you imagine two employees who were

23

fired by an employing agency for leaking information to

24

the press, confidential information to the press, they

25

both challenge their removals, but they raise slightly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40

different arguments.

2

think the employment statute should be construed to

3

allow me to be fired for this reason because I think the

4

employment statute should be construed with First

5

Amendment principles in mind and shouldn't reach this

6

case.

7

The first one says, well, I don't

The second one says I concede that the

8

employment statutes allow my firing for this reason, but

9

I think those -- I think that statute is

10

unconstitutional as applied.

11

Now, those are really the same claim and --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Feigin, they might

13

well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the

14

one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant

15

distinction.

16

Well, maybe one answer is that the MSPB can decide both.

17

But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other,

18

it seems -- I mean, that's -- it seems like a sensible

19

dividing line.

20

Now, you might be right in what you said.

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, even if the

21

MSPB lacks the authority to strike down a Federal

22

statute, I still think it might be able to adjudicate

23

the claim of the employee, the second employee, who

24

brings it as an as-applied challenge because the Court

25

would -- I'm sorry; not the Court -- the MSPB could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

decide that case on the same constitutional avoidance

2

grounds that are -- that are urged by the first

3

employee.

4

That is, they really are the same case.

5

Before striking down a statute as constitutional, this

6

Court all the time, it instructs lower courts, and this

7

would be true of agencies, too, should interpret the

8

statute to avoid any significant constitutional

9

question.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

But they're not at all the

11

same claim.

12

means something; and insofar as it's applied to a

13

particular situation, it's unconstitutional.

14

one says it doesn't mean that.

15

They're related, but one says the statute

MR. FEIGIN:

The other

Well, Your Honor, I think they

16

are the same in the respect that, as I was just saying

17

to Justice Kagan, if the MSPB --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

When we -- just let me rephrase

19

that.

20

interpretation based on the principle of constitutional

21

avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the

22

statute?

23

If -- if this Court adopts a certain

MR. FEIGIN:

No, Your Honor, but there may

24

be ambiguity in a statute that the Court interprets to

25

avoid a significant constitutional question.

Alderson Reporting Company

So, maybe

Official

42
1

I can give another example that might flesh this out a

2

little bit.

3

There's a statute, 5 U.S.C. 7311, that bars

4

from Federal employment people who have participated in

5

strikes.

6

raises a factual or statutory challenge to that claim.

7

constitutional grounds.

12

And he also challenges the statute on

And the most common case brought to the

13

MSPB, in our experience, that raises a constitutional

14

claim also raises the sort of factual and statutory

15

claims I was just suggesting.

16

resolve that first question -- those first set of

17

questions in such a way as to avoid the constitutional

18

question by saying that the statute doesn't reach the

19

conduct that the particular employee engaged in.

20

Now, the MSPB might

And if we imagine instead that the employee

21

had only brought the constitutional claim, which would

22

be kind of a strange way to litigate because he'd be

23

giving up arguments on which he might win, I still think

24

that the MSPB could decide, look, before we send this

25

off to the Federal Circuit and decide that the only way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

we can grant you relief is to say that a Federal statute

2

is unconstitutional, which is something we don't think

3

we can do, we should at least take a look at the statute

4

to see whether these somewhat ambiguous terms,

5

"participate" and "strike," actually do apply to your

6

conduct.

8

And by failing to give the MSPB the first
crack at doing that, what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any such

possibility in this case?

Ginsburg.

The statute does not, as we explain in our brief, draw

any distinction between the types of arguments that

Although, that's weird in

another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, because, can we

the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional?

But the point

10

is, Justice Breyer, even if our rule does have a couple

of hiccups with it, we do think it is much superior to

greatly preferred the latter because that preserves

3

the -- the basic idea of the CSRA, which was to

4

consolidate and streamline judicial review.

5

As this Court recognized in Fausto, Congress

6

specifically did not want challenges to adverse actions

7

to go through district court into the court of appeals

8

and get a duplicative and wasteful two-layer judicial

9

review.

10

Instead -JUSTICE ALITO:

If anybody who drafted or

11

voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about

12

a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a

13

facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute,

14

do you think they would have said, well, the way we

15

think that this should be handled is this scheme that

16

you have proposed?

17

MR. FEIGIN:

I think they would have

18

preferred it to a scheme where, first of all, the claims

19

go to district court, which is precisely what the CSRA

20

was trying to eliminate; and, second of all, to a scheme

21

where it becomes confusing and dependent on precisely

22

how a plaintiff frames his argument which court winds up

23

entertaining the claim.

24

Now --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you know of any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

other -- any other case where an appellate court has

2

authority to decide a question that the court of first

instance lacked authority to decide?

4

5

I mean, you say

I couldn't think of another case where a

6

court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first

view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of

8

9

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, first of all,

10

we cite several examples of courts of appeals deciding

constitutional questions in the first instance, at pages

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feigin, could I go back

to the Chief Justice's question about what actually

22

the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive

23

factual record showing how much has changed in the

24

military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women

25

play in the military.

Presumably in this case, what

And that it's almost impossible

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

to litigate this kind of claim without having such a

2

record.

3

Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations.

4

So, how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record

5

that is needed to litigate this claim?

6

That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that

MR. FEIGIN:

You would develop it in the

7

MSPB, either in the first instance on the initial

8

appeal, or the MSPB could let it go to the Federal

9

Circuit without having developed an administrative

10

record.

11

the judges to address the merits in this case, believed

12

that a factual record was necessary, it could remand to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, the idea

6

of -- the special masters floating around freely every

7

time you get one of these cases -- I mean, what --

to have a more or less permanent special master who gets

all these things.

special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of

claims.

13

that's expert in the interrelation between the different

provisions in the statute.

submitted, the conclusions one would draw from that

15

evidence will be fairly obvious.

16

stipulate to the facts that would set forth review.

But once the evidence is

For example, in

So, in this case, for example, I don't think

23

government is going to be willing to stipulate to that.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the

I suspect that if this were

litigated in district court, the government would move

Alderson Reporting Company

to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't

2

matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the --

3

the things that are done in the military, the

4

Registration Act is still constitutional.

5

take that position?

6

MR. FEIGIN:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Wouldn't you

Your Honor, I don't -Would you say that if -- if

8

it can be proven that they've -- that women are now --

9

that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may

10

be unconstitutional?

11

Anyway, assuming that you might take that

12

position, then -- and you might win on that -- then what

13

would be the point of having all of this discovery that

14

you're talking about?

15

MR. FEIGIN:

Well --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

All of this -- all of this

17

development of the factual record?

18

does it make to develop a big factual record before you

19

know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any

20

difference?

21

MR. FEIGIN:

What -- what sense

Well, Your Honor, the way to

22

deal with that would be to just have a very quick stop

23

in the MSPB which assures itself, yes, this is a

24

constitutional challenge to a statute.

25

recognized in Weinberger v. Salfi, for example, it is

Alderson Reporting Company

As the Court

54

useful to have -- at least exhaust the claim with the

agency for that purpose.

3

Yes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there any rule of the

board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an

5

offer of proof?

6

MR. FEIGIN:

7

in fact, it would be --

8
9

There is not, Your Honor, and,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wouldn't that be the

proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a

10

constitutional claim?

11

then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more

12

evidence or not.

13

Make your offer of proof, and

MR. FEIGIN:

That's where I was going with

14

this, Your Honor.

In fact, the MSPB has a special

15

rule -- I believe it's 5 C.S.R. 1201.61; it's cited in

16

our brief -- where even if the MSPB decided not to

17

accept evidence for some reason, a description of the

18

evidence would go in the record and, therefore, be

19

available for the Federal Circuit.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if -- I guess

21

that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its

22

constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it?

23

MR. FEIGIN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

in analogous cases decided constitutional claims that

weren't raised in front of an agency when the agency

couldn't decide them.

6

would make sense to exhaust, for the reasons I was

7

explaining earlier and to Justice Ginsburg, which is

that it may be that the MSPB finds that the statute

9

doesn't really cover the situation.

In the Government's view, it

Now, I acknowledge

10

that's not going to happen in this case; it is clear

11

that section 3328 required these people's removals.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

You're -- you're

13

actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions

14

that the agency has no authority to decide?

15

MR. FEIGIN:

16

Court has recognized --

Yes, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the

Curiouser and curiouser.

If you don't bring before

20

the agency a question that the agency says it has no

21

authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability?

22

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

23

what should happen in this -- in a case like this is

24

that the employee appeals to the MSPB and says nothing

25

at all.

The employee should appeal to the MSPB and at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

least say what his constitutional claim is.

2

benefit of that, as the Court has recognized in, for

3

example, Weinberger v. Salfi, is that the agency can

4

assure itself, yes, it's a constitutional claim that is

5

beyond my authority to resolve, and there's no other way

6

for me to resolve it.

7

And the

Another benefit of presenting these claims

8

to the agency is the MSPB hasn't been crystal clear

9

about exactly where its authority begins and ends; and

10

neither the Federal Circuit nor this Court has addressed

11

that question at all.

12

first instance to determine whether it has the authority

13

to grant the plaintiff the relief he is seeking has a

14

great benefit of clarifying what the scope of the MSPB's

15

authority is.

16

and the Federal Circuit to be deciding what the scope of

17

the MSPB's authority is than it is to file a claim in

18

the District of Massachusetts and have that district

19

court and then the First Circuit debating about what the

20

proper scope of the MSPB's authority is.

21

And allowing the agency in the

It makes a lot more sense for the MSPB

I think the CSRA expresses a clear

22

preference that appeals of adverse actions like this go

23

through the MSPB and to the Federal Circuit, so that

24

they can decide those kinds of questions.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Again --

Where did -- where did

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

Salfi go?

The agency couldn't decide the constitutional

2

question.

So, what's the next stop?

3

appeals or the district court?

4

MR. FEIGIN:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. FEIGIN:

Was it a court of

In Salfi, Your Honor?
Yes.

That would have been in

7

district court.

However, under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), which

8

was at issue in Salfi and Illinois Council, the district

9

court is performing essentially appellate-style review

10

of the agency's findings.

11

course is that any additional factfindings that would be

12

necessary would be made on remand and not taken by the

13

district court.

14
15

That is, any -- the preferred

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not on the constitutional

question.

16

MR. FEIGIN:

I think it would still be the

17

preferred course that the agency would do any further

18

factfinding that would be necessary in the first

19

instance.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why?

The district court

21

is -- that's what it's equipped to do.

22

does all the time.

23

That's what it

And --

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, under 405(g), rather than

24

1331, the preferred form of factfinding is in the agency

25

and remands to the agency for further factfinding,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

rather than development of the facts in the district

2

court in the first instance.

3

In any event, the Court has recognized that

4

in Thunder Basin, for example, where review in the first

5

instance was in the court of appeals, that the court of

6

appeals had adequate authority to give meaningful

7

judicial review to a constitutional claim that an

8

agency, in that case the Mine Commission, by hypothesis

9

could not decide.

10

Thank you.

Thank you,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Thank you.

We're not here

17

for an exercise in which side can best rewrite the Civil

18

Service Reform Act so that the Petitioners' claims can

19

fit in it.

20

the background rule that Federal courts have Federal

21

question jurisdiction, under the common law and under

22

section 1331, to rule on claims challenging the

23

constitutionality of an act of Congress.

24
25

What we're here for is to determine whether

Now, the fall-back position is that that
jurisdiction remains.

What this Court is -- is tasked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

to do is to see whether it's fairly discernible from the

2

Civil Service Reform Act as it was written by Congress,

3

not as it's twisted or amended or bent to fit these

4

claims in it, but whether the Civil Service Reform Act

5

as written by Congress revokes that background Federal

6

court jurisdiction.

7

And I suggest that the gyrations that have

8

been discussed about, well, we could do this, we could

9

go up, we could go down, we could do these odd

10

procedures, show that it is not fairly discernible that

11

Congress intended to somehow try to shoehorn these

12

claims within the CSRA framework.

13

not because the Government's system is better, not

14

because the system that I'm proposing works better or is

15

faster, but because there is no fairly discernible

16

evidence from the Civil Service Reform Act, as written

17

by Congress, that Congress intended to revoke this very

18

fundamental jurisdiction of the district courts.

19

And for that reason,

This is a Marbury case, not a Bivens case.

20

This is fundamental jurisdiction, the power of the

21

Federal court to say that Congress, not some Federal

22

agency, but that Congress acted in violation of the

23

Constitution.

24

act carefully before deciding that Congress took that

25

fundamental jurisdiction away from the district courts,

And I suggest that it -- the Court should

Alderson Reporting Company

and that is not fairly discernible that Congress did

2

that through the wording of the Civil Service Reform

3

Act.
