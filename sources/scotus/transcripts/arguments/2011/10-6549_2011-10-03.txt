ORAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. CAIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Recognizing that certain offenders convicted

11

before enactment or an implementation of SORNA would be

12

unable to comply with SORNA's initial registration

13

requirement, Congress included section 16913(d)

14

delegating to the Attorney General the authority to

15

determine whether and how to apply SORNA's registration

16

requirements to those offenders.

17

Mr. Reynolds is one of those offenders

18

because he was convicted, sentenced, and released from

19

prison a year before SORNA was enacted.

20

exercise of the Attorney General's authority under

21

subsection (d), Mr. Reynolds had no obligation to

22

register under SORNA, could not initially register under

23

SORNA, and, therefore, was not subject to SORNA's

24

criminal penalties.

25

needed to bring offenders like Mr. Reynolds into the new

But for a valid

Action by the Attorney General was

system.

2

And because both implementing SORNA and

3

determining whether and how SORNA would be applied to

4

pre-enactment offenders would require time and

5

consideration, Congress left the Wetterling Act

6

registration law in place for 3 years to ensure that all

7

offenders would be covered under the old law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

the Lychner Act, criminal penalties were added.

under the Wetterling Act for acts committed prior to

13

1996?

14

The -- are you admitting that there were no

Is that what you're saying?
MS. CAIN:

Your Honor, the Wetterling Act,

15

as it was enacted in 1994, was a registration

16

requirement without criminal penalties.

17

Lychner Act was enacted amending Wetterling and added

18

the criminal penalty, the Federal criminal penalty of

19

1-year punishment for failure to register.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In 1996, the

And that included all

21

individuals who had -- who had been convicted of -- of

22

sex abuse acts before 1996?

23

MS. CAIN:

24

Our reading better accords with the text of

25

I don't know.

SORNA and congressional intent, but the Government
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reading is simply not reasonable.

If SORNA were to

2

apply to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation

3

offenders on day one, and the Attorney General could

4

then modify in the future, which would in fact -- in

5

effect repeal SORNA as to some offenders, then you could

6

have a situation where someone was convicted of an

7

offense and then have to be covered under SORNA, and

8

then later the AG could decide that that group was

9

not required to register.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

Attorney General doesn't have that power.

12

position is that whether this behavior, not registering,

13

is criminal or not is left up to the Attorney General,

14

is left up to the executive.

15

where Congress says, well, we don't know whether this

16

should be a criminal offense; so, we're going to leave

17

it to the Attorney General?

18

Well, maybe -- maybe the
But your

Do we have other examples

It's quite different to say the Attorney

19

General will implement it in the technical details, but

20

to say that whether it's a criminal offense or not is up

21

to the Attorney General -- is there any other instance

22

where that's so?

23

MS. CAIN:

Your Honor, I'm not aware of any,

24

but we don't -- this is not what the Attorney General is

25

doing.

This is -- SORNA is a civil registration

whether someone has to register.

3

4

to travel and then fail to register.

5

not actually deciding whether someone would be guilty of

6

a crime or convicted of a crime or exposed to a crime.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In order for a

So, it's really

I -- maybe I just don't

8

grasp the core of the case then.

I thought this was a

9

criminal conviction and that you were arguing that it's

10

a criminal conviction because the conduct that's

11

prohibited by the statute was conduct that covered this

12

class of people by order of the Attorney General under

13

the interim regs.

14

I mean, is that wrong?

MS. CAIN:

Your Honor, actually what we are

15

seeking is the ability to contest the Attorney General's

16

rule.

We're saying -­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm asking, isn't this is

18

criminal conviction that resulted from the fact that

19

your client was within the class of persons covered by

20

the statute?

21

anyway.

22

Attorney General acted, but then you say it's a criminal

23

-- it's a civil provision?

24
25

The Government says they're covered

You say they're covered only because the

failure to register and then travel -- I mean, travel

and then fail to register after you are obligated under

2

SORNA to register is a crime, yes.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -- you know, my

4

problem is that's very strange.

I find it very strange

5

to leave it up to the Attorney General whether something

6

will be a crime or not.

7

Attorney General says so, and it won't be a crime if he

8

doesn't.

9

General, for Pete's sake; he's the prosecutor.

It will be a crime if the

You

10

know, it will be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it is,

11

and it won't be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it

12

isn't.

13

and I -- I think it's sailing close to the edge of

14

unconstitutionality; whereas, what the other side claims

15

is simply it's a crime to begin with, but the Attorney

16

General can make it not a crime.

17

like prosecutorial discretion.

judgment, if it shouldn't be a crime, you know -- I have

19

trouble with that, too.

That -- that's sort of

very strange.

claim?

MS. CAIN:

Or are you contesting

Well, Your Honor, our -- our case

does not involve the time period after August of 2008.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, it's -- so, this

17

whole case is about what happens between February '07

18

and August '08, and that's the limit of it.

19

MS. CAIN:

Right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because there was no rule

21

at all before February '07, and there was a rule August

MS. CAIN:

what the standing issue is about.

No, but the -- SORNA would not

apply to Mr. Reynolds before then.

2

You might have some other

case, but this case is about a challenge to a rule as

there had to be the rule for you to make the challenge.

I'm sorry.

So,

I missed the last

part.

Is that -- that's as I understand it.

You are challenging the

Attorney General's first rule as invalid, the
February '07 rule.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You say it's invalid

14

challenge -- your challenge doesn't reach before that,

15

because there was no rule before that so that you can -­

16

the earliest point is when the rule was adopted, you're

17

saying, the rule was invalid.

18

brackets are from when there was an allegedly invalid

19

rule, which was in February '07, until when there's a

20

valid rule, which is in August of '08.

mean, that -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, that's not -­

24

no.

Your argument, as I understand it, is there was no

25

notice and comment when he issued the interim rule.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. CAIN:

Right.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If there had been

3

notice and comment, you would have jumped in with

4

comments that would have convinced the Attorney General

5

not to apply the rule to your client.

6

MS. CAIN:

That's right.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MS. CAIN:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

That's right.
And your argument is

10

further that without the rule, SORNA doesn't exist,

11

right?

12

MS. CAIN:

For our client.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MS. CAIN:

He is -­

Right.

He is unable to comply with the

15

initial registration provision under (b) because he was

16

released from prison a year before SORNA was enacted.

17

So, he could not meet either one of the descriptions of

18

initial registration.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

That doesn't mean -- that

20

doesn't mean SORNA doesn't apply; it means 2250 doesn't

21

apply.

22

MS. CAIN:

That's right.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MS. CAIN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that right?

Well -­
I mean, it might be a

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

metaphysical, but it may be that Congress intended the

2

statute to apply to people like your client, but the

3

question is when the initial registration has to take

4

place.

5

General acts, we don't know.

6

doesn't criminalize a failure until he can know when

7

he's supposed to register.

And I took you as saying until the Attorney

8
9

MS. CAIN:

So, 2250 doesn't -­

Register under SORNA.

That's

right.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. CAIN:

That's right.

Okay.

The problem is here that the

12

prosecution -- the Attorney General's office is

13

substituting a State registration for the initial

14

registration under SORNA, and that's just not what the

15

text says.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Cain, why do you think
I

17

Congress would have written the statute in this way?

18

mean, in your brief, you say it was all very complicated

19

and Congress was worried about certain problems, the way

20

different registrations overlapped on each other.

21

exactly what was so complicated?

22

just have applied the statute to people in

23

Mr. Reynolds's situation itself?

24
25

MS. CAIN:

But

Why couldn't Congress

Well, even the Government agrees,

in their brief, that there are complications.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I was going to ask the

2

Government the same question.

3

complications -­

4

MS. CAIN:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6
7

What are the

Well -­
-- that Congress was so

worried about?
MS. CAIN:

Some sex offenders, you know,

8

from the various States -- there were State laws that

9

were varied amongst each other.

There was the Federal

10

Wetterling Act that had its own different periods of

11

registration and different requirements.

12

And I think that one of the permutations -­

13

some of them are that some sex offenders never had to

14

register in some States; some had been convicted before

15

and had served out their time and no longer had to

16

register; and some were released from prison, you know,

17

before the enactment or implementation of -- of SORNA.

18

And an example of a permutation that

19

was going to take some thought and some consideration is

20

the one that sort of is an example in a different

21

context, in the Federal Register and in the Government's

22

brief, which is that certain people who had served their

23

time and were completely out of the system, if they got

24

re-arrested for a misdemeanor, the Attorney General

25

decided that those individuals did not have to register
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for a State to be deemed substantially implemented with

2

respect to SORNA.

3

of decision, a complication that the Attorney General

4

was particularly well-suited to deciding and making that

5

determination.

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Arrested for a

misdemeanor to do what?

8
9

And so, that's an example of a type

MS. CAIN:

Any arrest for a misdemeanor that

would bring a previous offender back in the system -- if

10

that person was just convicted of a misdemeanor, they

11

would not -- the State would not have to re-register

12

them in order to be deemed substantially compliant with

13

SORNA and get the Byrne grant money.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought Justice

15

Kagan's question was, what would have stopped Congress

16

from just saying you have to register on the day of

17

passage?

18

that, correct?

19

There was nothing to stop Congress from doing

MS. CAIN:

They could have done that, but

20

they were concerned about how you get the older

21

conviction, the older pre-enactment people into the new

22

system.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

why they didn't do that.

25

correct?

That's your reason for

They didn't make it automatic,

That's your argument?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. CAIN:

Right.

They wanted to have a new

2

registration, a new system that would start from a

3

certain point that would bring in new requirements.

4

the problem is how to get the people with the older

5

convictions and the older registrations into the system.

6

And that would be done with initial registration.

But

Well, why is -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why is it easier for the

11

Attorney General to do that by regulation than for

12

Congress simply to do it by the statute itself?

13

did they expect to happen in the regulatory process that

14

would solve these problems for them?

15

MS. CAIN:

What

Well, I think that it's more

16

flexible to have a regulation and takes perhaps less

17

time than legislation to think of all the different

18

permutations.

21

changes.

22

They don't know every State's laws and

And so, it was more

Well, take this case.

23

What would compliance entail other than simply telling

24

the Missouri authority -- I mean, he had to register,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

14

If I could start by answering your question,

15

Your Honor, about the Wetterling Act, it was not

16

retroactive.

17

It defined a sex offender, unlike SORNA, as somebody who

18

is convicted of a sex offense, and in guidelines issued

19

after Wetterling and after several subsequent amendments

20

to the Wetterling Act, the Attorney General interpreted

21

it as only requiring States to register offenders that

22

are convicted not only post-enactment but

23

post-implementation by the States.

4

5

convicted" to "was convicted" in order to include

6

pre-enactment offenders.

7

And so, 61 Federal Register cite 15,112 is
And so,

Justice Kagan, to get to your question about

8

why is it all so complicated, our answer is that it

9

really is not.

There's no reason why it couldn't have

10

applied on day one to all pre-enactment and

11

pre-implementation offenders.

12

you look about all pre-enactment and pre-implementation,

13

this is an incredibly large class.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen in -- in

this situation:

Someone is convicted of a sex offense

5

before SORNA is enacted; then shortly after the statute

is enacted, the person moves to a new State, does not

7

register; then after that, the Attorney General,

8

exercising the authority that you say he has under -­

9

exercising -- excuse me, exercising the authority under

10

subsection (d), determines that SORNA shouldn't apply to

11

people who were convicted of offenses before its

enactment?

offense?

Would that person have committed a criminal

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I think at the -- at the

15

time he acted, yes.

could decide whether or not he was going to apply his

regulation prospectively or retrospectively.

On Petitioner's view, the Attorney General

therefore, was willing to leave that to the Attorney

General, then I don't understand why it would have made

Congress did know that it wanted to include as a general

13

14

pre-enactment but pre-implementation offenders as -­

15

offenders as well.

16

when you look to the provisions that actually speak to

17

what a sex offender was required to do under the Act -­

18

same way.

When you look at all six of those provisions

23

on their face, they apply to all sex offenders so

defined without any qualification.

lack of any qualification within those provisions, by

Sure.

If I could break

15

it up into a few classes.

16

pretty much -- actually, we are talking about everybody

17

on day one.

18

pre-implementation offenders, they're still going to be

19

in prison on the day that SORNA was enacted.

So, people -- and then

the second group I was going to talk about are offenders

It's the very same State registry system that

pre-existed SORNA.

8

9

SORNA-compliant registry.

They're already initially registered.

There is no creation of any SORNA

To the contrary, it defines a

sex offender registry in 16911, subsection (9).

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, your -- your

4

argument is that "requirements" in the heading for 42

5

U.S.C. 16913, Registration requirements for sex

6

offenders, means something different than "requirements"

7

in subsection (d), which the Attorney General can issue

8

rules about, because you're saying, although there is

9

the requirement that they register and comply with (c)

10

and all those other things, when it says that the

11

Attorney General can issue regulations specifying the

12

applicability of the requirements of this subchapter,

13

that only meant the administration, you know,

14

provisions, not the general requirement that you

15

register and keep current and all that.

2

And let me give a couple of examples.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you are

3

talking about sort of in the weeds, the little details,

4

not the underlying requirement of registration, right?

5

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

No, I think it -- I think

6

arguably it could be both.

7

something that Congress thought the Attorney General was

8

necessarily going to have to exercise.

9

the Attorney General has not done so.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Again, I don't think this is

And, in fact,

But does that mean, Ms.

11

Sherry, that -- that the Attorney General could, if he

12

wanted to, for whatever reason, could exempt all

13

pre-enactment offenders from SORNA?

14

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I think as a theoretical

15

matter, on its face, the delegation of authority in (d)

16

is -- is quite broad and plenary.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think as -­

And would allow that.

So,

18

when you say it gave the Attorney General the ability to

19

confirm or modify the requirement in section (a), you

20

mean he could, if he wanted to, exempt all pre-enactment

21

offenders.

22

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

And, again, I say in

23

theory because I think, like all delegations of

24

authority, the Attorney General is certainly limited to

25

acting in furtherance of the purpose of Congress, and

this to pre-enactment offenders as well and can specify

how to do that.

right, especially because of subsection (b), because on

24

the day that SORNA was enacted, every single person in

25

prison at that time was by definition a pre-enactment

The one thing I would say on

Alderson Reporting Company

offender.

2

(b), it quite easily applies to quite a number of

3

pre-enactment offenders.

4

And so, on its face when you read subsection

And the other point I would make along those

5

lines is the fact that subsection (d) just doesn't talk

6

about pre-enactment; it talks about pre-implementation

7

offenders.

8

SORNA's enactment but before a State had implemented,

9

again, quite easily fit not only within subsection (b)

10

So, offenders that were convicted after

but within all the other subsections as well.

11

And with respect to the interrelationship

12

between them, I think subsection (a) really identifies

13

the jurisdictions in which an offender needs to

14

register.

15

jurisdictions and where an offender both needs to

16

register and to keep the information current.

17

And so, the first sentence sets out three

Subsection (b) really serves a limited

18

purpose.

It's an intake process.

It's getting an

19

offender into the system.

20

who are already in the very same system, there's nothing

21

to be done under (b); (b) simply doesn't apply to them.

22

(B) is applied to people who are not already in that

23

system, and for those that can comply with the timing,

24

it gets them in before they're released to the

25

community.

For offenders like Reynolds

37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

But the inability to comply with subsection

2

(b) for the small set of offenders that cannot comply

3

with the timing requirements, it doesn't immunize them

4

from complying with all of the other registration

5

requirements.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, you're

7

reading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the

8

person who was convicted last year and has 4 more years

9

to do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he

10

changes his name, if he stops being a student while in

11

prison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after.

12

would say if that's your reading of those two sections,

13

it's -- it's going to confuse everybody who is in

14

prison, as it did confuse me.

15

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

16
17

I

That is not my reading of

the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Then I take it

18

your reading is he does not have to fulfill (c) until

19

after he has to have initially registered.

20

we're back to the question of why you treat somebody who

21

committed the crime long ago with less clarity, with

22

less time to initially register, with more confusion

23

from one jurisdiction than another, than you would treat

24

a person who was convicted last year, is still in jail,

25

and has 4 more years to register.
38

That's why I read (d)

as trying to sort that kind of thing out.

2

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Two points on that:

Number one, for offenders like Reynolds that are already

4

registered, there's nothing more to be done as far as

5

registration goes.

6

information current and to keep it updated.

7

All they need to do is to keep the

talking about 2250, Congress provided other protections

9

for offenders that were unable to comply with the timing

10

requirements.

11

impossibility affirmative defense in 2250(b).

12

other thing that Congress did is it required that any

13

failure to register, in order to be subject to criminal

14

sanctions, that it be a knowing failure to register.

15

other words, that the offender know he has a

16

registration requirement and know that he is not

17

complying with that requirement.

18

Number one, it -- it provided an

So, the idea that there are some

And so -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why -- why isn't

5

part of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that

6

the one person who doesn't have to register for 4 years

7

is in prison already; so, presumably, he doesn't present

8

the same type of threat that led to the enactment of

9

these registration laws in the first place?

10

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

That's absolutely right.

11

I mean, the release from -- the reason the release from

12

prison is the -- is the trigger is because the concern

13

and the reason we have registration is for periods of

14

time where these offenders are released into the

15

community.

16

And that's why the timing requirement in (b)

17

is there.

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

No, it's actually -- it's

22

not unique with respect to the statute.

It's quite

23

common for status offenses, and let me try to give one

example.

violence conviction in 1990, for example, and had had a

firearm in his house, in his possession, for the last

8

20 years, when the statute was passed in 1996 he was in

9

violation of the statute.

Of course, he couldn't be

10

criminally prosecuted unless he was given some

11

reasonable period of time to get rid of the firearm.

12

But there's nothing unique with respect to that.

13

And, again, the criminal provision here,

2250, provides additional protections.

delegation of authority to the Attorney General.

25

Congress had wanted the Attorney General to decide

It certainly is somewhat unusual

46
Alderson Reporting Company

If

1

whether or not the registration requirements at the very

2

core of this statute had any operative effect going

3

forward, presumably it would have told the Attorney

4

General that he needed to do something.

5

That's something that Congress did in many

6

other provisions of SORNA where Congress said the

direct the Attorney General to take a certain action.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the question -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're starting from a

5

proposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress

6

necessarily and under all circumstances thought that it

7

had to include pre-SORNA convictions.

8

know -- yes, it wanted a uniform system, but it had

9

State systems in place; it had an imperfect Wetterling

10

Act in place.

11

to punish non-registrants.

12

But I don't

It had lots of other mechanisms in place

So, you're starting from the proposition

13

that, by necessity, they wanted to include preconviction

14

felonies.

15

legislative history, and I know many of my colleagues

16

don't believe in it or pay attention to it, there were

17

two bills passed on SORNA, one a House bill that made it

18

very clear, explicitly clear, that it applied to

19

pre-SORNA conviction felons; and the Senate bill which

20

under the label Retroactivity had the terms that (d) now

21

has.

22

But I guess for those of us who believe in

Doesn't that suggest to us that Congress

23

itself was unsure of whether it wanted to include the

24

pre-SORNA convictions or not?

25

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I don't think so, and for

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

two reasons.

2

don't think the Senate bill, just like I don't think

3

subsection (d) means that Congress meant to apply the

4

registration requirements to all pre-enactment offenders

5

in the registration provisions and then take away that

6

application in the specify the applicability provision.

7

First, to address the bills themselves, I

In the Senate bill that you're talking

8

about, it defined a sex offender as anybody who has been

9

convicted of a sex offense.

And as this Court said in

10

Carr, that's the language that Congress quite often uses

11

when it intends to include pre-enactment conduct.

12

So, I think the verb choice, both in the

13

Senate bill, in the House bill, and in the bill that was

14

actually enacted, indicates that it did intend to

15

include pre-enactment offenders.

16

The other point I'd want to make is, again,

17

another point that was made in Carr, which is that the

18

registration requirements stand at the very center of

19

Congress's efforts to find and to register the 100,000

20

missing sex offenders that had fallen off the registry

21

rolls under the previous regime.

22

So, I think it is quite clear with respect

23

to SORNA that Congress did want to include pre-enactment

24

offenders.

25

offenders; it wanted to make sure that they got back on

It wanted to not only find those missing sex

49
Alderson Reporting Company

1

the registry rolls.

2

thousand offenders that were already on the registry

3

rolls when SORNA was enacted, they wanted to make sure

4

that they stayed on the registry rolls, that they kept

5

the information current, they continued to update their

6

information going forward.

7

And as far as the hundreds of

And, again, with respect to pre-enactment

8

offenders that were in prison at the time that SORNA was

9

enacted, it wanted to make sure to get them on the

10

registry rolls before they left prison, before they

11

entered the community.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I guess my problem is

13

that you make an assumption, you continue to make an

14

assumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -­

15

that the Attorney General was incapable of acting

16

quickly.

17

I mean, if the Attorney General had, within

18

a few months, done what he ultimately did a year later

19

or whatever time period after, had come out and said it

20

applies; this is what you do; briefly, you register

21

wherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move

22

or change your name -- then Congress would have

23

accomplished the goal it wanted.

24
25

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

If the -- if Congress had

wanted the Attorney General to act and to act quickly,
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1

presumably Congress would have told the Attorney General

2

that he had to do something.

3

Congress did in many other provisions of SORNA.

4

Congress wasn't shy about -­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Again, that's something

Well, why did -- the

6

Attorney General did try to act very swiftly, and if the

7

Attorney General thought that SORNA applied from day

8

one, why did the Attorney General try to rush through

9

regulation that said nothing more than SORNA applies?

10

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Because when the Attorney

11

General issued the interim rule, what he said was that

12

reading it on the face, I do think it applies to

13

everybody, but I recognize the defendants are making an

14

alternative argument.

15

important that it apply to everybody, and that it apply

16

to everyone quickly, because we're talking about

17

protecting our communities; we're talking about

18

protecting the public and protecting our children from

19

sex offenders.

20

-- is not only not good for protecting the public, but

21

it's not good for sex offenders; it's not good for

22

jurisdictions that are trying to work towards

23

substantial implementation of SORNA.

24
25

And I think it's incredibly

And having this uncertainty out there is

And so, I think you could look at it one of
two ways.

If the idea is, well, Congress left it to the
51
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Attorney General, but the Attorney General could have

2

acted very quickly, I think that suggests that there

3

probably wasn't that much for the Attorney General to do

4

in the first place, and there's little reason that

5

Congress would not have made that decision on its own.

6

To the extent you think there was a whole

7

bunch of things for the Attorney General to do, which,

8

again, we disagree with, presumably that's something

9

that would take some time.

And during the interim,

10

period those 100,000 sex offenders would remain missing;

11

additional sex offenders would be added to that number;

12

and the community and the public would continue to be at

13

risk going forward.

14

If there -­
