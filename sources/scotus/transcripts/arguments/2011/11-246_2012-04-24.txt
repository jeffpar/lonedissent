ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 11-247

9
10

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The suit in this case suffers from two

12

independent jurisdictional defects, either one of which

13

provides a basis for reversing the judgment of the court

14

of appeals.

15

The first is that the United States has not

16

waived its sovereign immunity from suits challenging its

17

title to Indian trust lands.

18

Patchak, the plaintiff, lacks prudential standing

19

because the interests that he seeks to vindicate in the

20

suit are not within the zone of interests protected or

21

regulated by section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act,

22

the provision whose alleged violation forms the basis

23

for his complaint.

24
25

And the second is that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me who you

think would have a valid and timely APA action to
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

challenge what the Secretary has allegedly done here,

2

which is to take lands into trust in violation of the

3

statute per our earlier -- I know that the U.S. is

4

challenging that assumption, but let's assume the -- the

5

reality of the allegation.

6

able to challenge it, and in what mechanism?

7

MR. MILLER:

Who would -- who would be

There are -- there are two parts

8

to that.

And taking the timing question first, the

9

claim would have to be brought before the land was taken

10

into trust.

11

30-day period after the announcement of the intent to

12

take the land into trust before title is actually

13

transferred.

14

period, as the MichGO plaintiffs did --

15
16
17

And that's why the regulations set out a

So somebody would have to file during that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That, I understand.

That's why I said timely filed.
MR. MILLER:

And the proper plaintiff for a

18

claim under section 5 -- and, of course, there can be

19

other claims under NEPA or the IGRA -- but under section

20

5 of the IRA, the proper plaintiff would be a State or

21

local government, because those are the entities that

22

are directly affected, directly regulated by the

23

transfer of jurisdiction to the tribe --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume a situation

where you first promise the land to one tribe, and then,
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in the midst of negotiations, another tribe lays claim.

2

The United States says, I change my mind; I'm going to

3

give the land to the other tribe.

4

you have denied the land to have any standing or any

5

rights with respect to challenging that determination?

6

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

Does the tribe that

As the beneficiaries of

7

section 5, the parties for whose benefit Congress acted

8

and the Secretary would be acting, I think in that

9

scenario a tribe would have standing to challenge it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Mr. Miller, you -- you claim

11

on behalf of the government that the decision of whether

12

to take the land into trust has nothing to do with the

13

use to which the land will be put; wherefore, these

14

plaintiffs who were complaining about the use to which

15

it'll be put have no standing.

16

If that is so, why did the government delay

17

the taking into trust for 3 years while there was

18

pending a lawsuit which would have prevented the use

19

that the government intended the newly trusted land to

20

be used for?

21

You delayed for 3 years because there was a

22

challenge to whether you could use -- whether this land

23

could be used for what you call gaming and I call

24

gambling.

25

Why did you delay for 3 years if it's
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

irrelevant?

2

MR. MILLER:

Well, the -- the challenge in

3

that case was -- was not just to the use.

4

decision to take title to land into trust.

5

Secretary's policy, as set out in --

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the

On what basis?

On any basis other than --

8
9

Well, wait.

It was to the

MR. MILLER:
example.

There was a NEPA claim, for

And the -- the plaintiff in that case, the

10

MichGO organization, alleged that the Secretary had not

11

complied with NEPA, had not adequately considered the

12

environmental consequences of the action to take the

13

land into trust.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what environmental

15

action consequences are there from the mere decision to

16

take it into trust?

17

be used for, you have no idea what the environmental

18

consequences are.

19

Unless you know what it's going to

MR. MILLER:

Well, that's -- that is true.

20

And it is also true that NEPA may in some circumstances

21

require consideration of the use for which the land is

22

to be put; but, it doesn't follow that section 5

23

requires or contemplates protecting the interests of

24

nearby landowners from the use.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the challenge was

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to -- was to the transfer, you say.

2

MR. MILLER:

3

That -- I mean, that was -- the

allegation --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Based in part on the use to

5

which it was going to be put; right?

6

MR. MILLER:

Right, but what -- what MichGO

7

was seeking, what the plaintiff was seeking in that

8

case, was an injunction barring the transfer.

9

And the Secretary's policy -- the whole point

10

of the 30-day regulation is to allow people who want to

11

challenge the transfer to have a full opportunity to

12

litigate those claims.

13

And that is why the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that wouldn't be true

14

15

window. The Secretary gives notice to affected persons.

16

So he comes in and he says:

17

authority to do it because this tribe wasn't under

18

Federal jurisdiction, and so I want you to call -- call

19

it off.

20

30 days.

21

Suppose he had filed in the 30-day

I think that you don't have

Nothing -- nothing has been transferred within

I thought both your brief and the tribe's

22

brief said that the judicial review would be available

23

to any affected person who used that procedure.

24

that -- is that true?

25

MR. MILLER:

Is

I mean, if they could establish
8

Alderson Reporting Company

1

standing, but -- if he had filed within the 30-day

2

period, the Secretary would not take title to the land

3

until there was a full opportunity for judicial review.

4
5
6

Now, in this case, he filed outside the
30-day period.

He was aware that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

was important if.

8

under Federal jurisdiction.

9

I'm an affected person.

But you said -- you had it

So the argument is this tribe wasn't
I could raise that because

Congress put on the Secretary.

13

15

So would there be

Mr. Patchak comes in within the 30-day
period, so he's not trying to undo any done deal.
MR. MILLER:

There would not be standing for

16

Patchak as a private individual, but there would be

17

standing for a State or local government or, in

18

the unusual situation that Justice Sotomayor suggested,

19

for another tribe --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So then you disagree with

21

the tribe that said in no uncertain terms, in its reply

22

brief, that this case is not about the availability of

23

judicial review.

25

Judicial review was available in the

with that in the context of the discussion of the

2

sovereign immunity issue.

3

statement in the tribe's brief to have been a concession

4

that there would have been standing.

5

I don't understand that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, on the standing point,

6

I mean, the -- the distinction that you're setting up

7

between acquisition of land and use of land -- this goes

8

back to Justice Scalia's question -- that strikes

9

me as -- as artificial, that the question of when land

10

is acquired is all tied up with the question of what use

11

is going to be made of it.

12

The government doesn't acquire this land with

13

no object in mind.

14

going to be used.

15

land use statute, isn't it?

16

It thinks about how the land is
So that in the end, this really is a

MR. MILLER:

Well, it is a land use statute

17

in -- in this sense, in the sense that -- and you're

18

right that the regulations do refer to the purposes for

19

which the land is to be used, but that's because --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the statute as well

21

thinks of this as a -- is a statute that's designed to

22

promote economic development, which is dependent on some

23

understanding of how the land is actually going to be

24

used by the tribes.

25

MR. MILLER:

That -- that is exactly right.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And that's why, in determining whether -- the Secretary

2

has to take account of use in order to determine whether

3

it will, in fact, serve the interest of promoting tribal

4

economic development and self-governance, but it doesn't

5

follow that the effect of that use on bystanders, on

6

other property owners in the vicinity, is within the

7

interests that Congress had in mind --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why not?

Of course, it

doesn't have to be within the interest, it just has to

10

be arguably within the interest.

11

left out in much of the discussion.

12

That -- that adverb is

But if, indeed, the use of the land is one of

13

the elements to be considered in taking title, why isn't

14

somebody who is affected by the proposed use within the

15

zone of interest?

16

MR. MILLER:

Because -- I mean, just to take

17

the facts of this case as an example, you know,

18

Patchak's objection is not to the jurisdictional

19

transfer.

20

to be tribal land rather than land subject to the taxing

21

or regulatory authority of the State of Michigan or

22

Allegan County --

23

It's not to the fact that this is now going

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

other words, it's not to the title.

25

MR. MILLER:

Just to interrupt, in

Well, I mean -- that is -- the
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1

relief he is trying to get is to undo that, but

2

the -- the injury doesn't come from that.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. MILLER:

I'm sorry.

The injury comes from the fact

5

that the land is going to be used for gaming, but in

6

1934 --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could put that it way,

8

or you could put it that the injury comes from the

9

government's taking title for gaming.

10

MR. MILLER:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

You could

put it that way as well.

11

13

Okay?

But -Inasmuch as the government

always has a purpose in mind when it takes title.
MR. MILLER:

But for the zone of interest

15

test, the question would be, are people who may be

16

adversely affected by gaming on Indian land within the

17

zone of interest -- is that interest arguably

18

something the tribe -- Congress was speaking to --

19
20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm a little confused.

The government -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On what date was it -- on

22

what date was it clear that the use would be gaming?

23

There is some suggestion in the briefs that, oh, well,

24

it could be light industry and it was zoned for economic

25

use generally.

At what point was it acknowledged by all
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that this would be for gaming?

2
3

MR. MILLER:

At the very outset?

I believe that in applying to

have the land taken into trust, the tribe said what --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. MILLER:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

At the very outset.

-- it wanted to happen.
What would happen if someone

7

filed a challenge within the 30-day period and then the

8

government took title to the land while the litigation

9

was pending?

Do the regulations preclude that from

10

happening while the litigation continues, or is it

11

necessary for the -- the challenger to obtain a stay

12

from a court?

13

MR. MILLER:

The regulations do not address

14

that.

The BIA manual provides that that action, of

15

taking the land into trust, should not be taken while

16

the litigation is pending.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. MILLER:

Well, is that enforceable?

I -- I think that it would not

19

be, but I think that -- I guess I would say two things

20

about that.

21

these regulations, the 30-day notice rule, precisely for

22

the purpose of ensuring that there would be an adequate

23

opportunity for judicial review, and thus removing the

24

constitutional doubt that the Eighth Circuit had found

25

associated with the IRA.

The first is that the Secretary enacted

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And I think -- so there is every reason to

2

think that the Secretary is going to conscientiously

3

carry out what those regulations provide for, which is

4

allowing judicial review.

5

ever to do that, I think he would find that going

6

forward in every case, courts would enter a stay.

7

And if the Secretary were

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

here.

9

not yet passed to the Secretary.

10

Well, they didn't

I mean, when Patchak filed his suit, title had

MR. MILLER:

And he sought a stay.

And -- and it was -- it was

11

denied, and he could have sought relief from the court

12

of appeals, and he didn't.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But nothing -- at

14

that point, you thought nothing prevented the Secretary

15

from moving forward, and in fact, the Secretary did move

16

forward even though he'd already filed the suit.

17

MR. MILLER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19
20
21

That -- yes.
Well, then why

isn't it just like your 30 days?
MR. MILLER:

Well, because this was a suit

that was not filed within the 30-day period.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. MILLER:

24

2

title action.

3

I'm just thinking of your quiet

This wasn't an action to quiet title at all.

4

This was a -- I looked at the complaint, as I -- as I

5

gather from his questions, so did the Chief Justice.

6

And it is a complaint filed before the -- the property

7

was taken into trust, and it asks for an injunction

8

under the APA, if it wants review of that, before the

9

government has any title to it at all, or at least it

10
11

hasn't taken it into trust.
So why are we considering quiet title?

12

has that to do with this?

13

exactly what -- now, that's the same as the Chief

14

Justice asked, and I have exactly the same question.

15

MR. MILLER:

Why isn't it

Right.

Well -- and in that

16

period before the land is taken into trust, the APA,

17

everyone agrees, permits -- permits that litigation.

18

What

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well, why isn't

19

that -- that's the end of that argument, then, isn't it?

20

Because this suit was brought seeking an injunction

21

before the land was taken into trust; the district court

22

denies the request for the injunction.

23

appeals reverses that.

24

And so there we are.

We're

1

sought before the land was taken into trust.

2

MR. MILLER:

Because at this point, the

3

question of whether to enjoin the transfer from taking

4

place is moot.

5
6
7

Because --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I don't know about that.

Well -MR. MILLER:

The relief that's being sought

8

now -- and this is made clear in Patchak's brief in the

9

court of appeals -- is an order compelling the Secretary

10
11

to relinquish the title to the land.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And so that --

Well, I don't know how --

12

how we should treat that.

13

Suppose that order was wrong.

14

granted the injunction.

15

send it back because that injunction should have been

16

granted, then have a hearing or trial or whatever you

17

want to have on whether the Act applies, and then figure

18

out how you do relief?

19

MR. MILLER:

There -- there was an order.
Suppose they should have

Then isn't what we should do,

Which I don't know.
No.

The time to seek review of

20

whether to enjoin a not-yet-completed transfer is before

21

the transfer is completed.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. MILLER:

They did.

But -- and if he wanted to

24

appeal the district court's denial of that injunction,

25

he could have done so as of right under -16
Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

He didn't appeal that.

He

appealed it different --

3

MR. MILLER:

He did not appeal it.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then your -- your

5

argument is just one of timing and not the fact that the

6

reliance is on the -- is on the QTA.

7

The tribe says, isn't it ironic that if you

8

really have a claim in the land as a property owner, you

9

can't sue under the QTA, and this person is much further

10

removed.

Well, that's because he has a different ground

11

for relief.

That's all we're talking about.

12

MR. MILLER:

Well, the --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the fact that the QTA

14

suddenly, deus ex machina, pops onto the scene doesn't

15

mean that it -- that that changes his -- his ground for

16

relief that he's -- that he's relying upon.

17

of relief has always been the same, APA.

18

MR. MILLER:

His ground

With -- with respect, Your

19

Honor, once the land is taken into trust, the -- the

20

only effective relief would be an order taking the land

21

out of trust, and that's what brings this within the

22

scope of the QTA.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that depends on whether

24

sovereign immunity is judged as of the time of the

25

filing of the complaint or as of the time of the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

litigation of the sovereign immunity claim, right?

2

you claim -- you don't want us to address that issue.

3

MR. MILLER:

And

We -- we think it's -- it's not

4

properly before the Court.

But I mean, one thing I

5

would just say about that is it is not remarkable, or it

6

often happens that, as the nature of the claims or the

7

identity of the parties changes throughout the course of

8

litigation, sovereign immunity can bar a suit that

9

wouldn't have been barred before.
And one example of that is under the Westfall

10
11

Act.

12

a tort, that suit can go forward.

13

General then certifies under the Westfall Act that the

14

employee was acting within the scope of his or her

15

17

of the FTCA exceptions, be brought --

The Act provides for that, right?
MR. MILLER:

Well, but that -- that's just an

21

example of how, as -- as the parties, or the relief --

22

here, it's the relief -- changes, sovereign immunity can

23

bar an action.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 11-246

4
5

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

When you strip title to land, which is a fact

7

in this case, you strip sovereignty.

You wreak havoc on

8

ongoing governmental operations, you -- on criminal

9

jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction, the backdrop against

10

which contracts were negotiated, investment decisions

11

made and economic development undertaken.

12

That is why the Congress of the United States

13

and this Court in Coeur D'Alene have never allowed

14

injunctive relief to strip the United States of title

15

that it has.

16

right or wrong, you cannot take title away that the

17

United States has.

18

The essence of sovereign immunity is,

the -- the old bugaboo of sovereign immunity, and says

22

when it -- when it will stand and when it won't.

23

MS. MILLETT:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

I

If you look -And if you're relying on the

Quiet Title Act, that -- that clearly covers only suits
19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

which seek to say, I own the land rather than the

2

government, and this is not such a suit.

3

why the normal APA principles wouldn't govern.

4

MS. MILLETT:

So I don't see

For two reasons, Justice

5

Scalia.

Because the APA itself -- and this is on page

6

6a of the addendum to our brief -- says that it does not

7

waive sovereign immunity and does not grant relief if

8

another statute expressly or impliedly forecloses the

9

relief that is sought.

And the Quiet Title Act says you

10

cannot have an injunction stripping the United States of

11

land, period, and you cannot have any litigation over

12

title --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but the relief to be

14

sought under the Quiet Title Act is title in the

15

plaintiff.

That's the relief ultimately sought.

16

MS. MILLETT:

No --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, on the way to that, you

18

may -- you may get some injunctive remedy, but the basis

19

for the lawsuit is -- is not:

20

MS. MILLETT:

I own the land.

With respect, Justice Scalia,

21

you can get no injunctive relief whatsoever even if you

22

are asserting title.

23

brought -- it limits relief to monetary compensation,

24

unless the government agrees to a specific relief.

25

But the Quiet Title Act itself is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Relief in that kind of suit,

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

yes.

2

MS. MILLETT:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Yes -Relief in that kind of suit.

But this is not that kind of suit.

5

MS. MILLETT:

But -- no.

Justice Scalia,

6

with respect, on page -- this is 2a of the addendum to

7

our brief, 2409a(a), the type of suit that is addressed,

8

and to which the Indian lands exception applies, is a

9

suit -- and I'm reading here from the second line of

10

a(a):

"A civil action -- "

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

I guess I've

lost you.

13

MS. MILLETT:

I'm sorry.

I'm on the addendum

14

to our -- the blue brief, 2a, and this is the Quiet

15

Title Act.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MS. MILLETT:

Okay.

And right -- subsection (a),

18

the second line, all right:

19

immunity is for a civil action under this section to

20

adjudicate a disputed title."

21
22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It does not say --

Ms. Millett, it also says:

"Under this section."

23

MS. MILLETT:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

"The waiver of sovereign

complaint.

It says:

Yes.
And the section describes the

"The complainant shall set forth
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with particularity the nature of the right, title, or

2

interest which the plaintiff claims."

3

So the type of suit that this section has in

4

mind is a suit in which the plaintiff claims a right,

5

title or interest.

6

"under this section," well, that's what this section is

7

about, a suit in which a plaintiff claims the right,

8

title or interest.

9

And the language that you read,

MS. MILLETT:

No, Justice Kagan, in this

10

respect.

That tells you what you have to do if you are

11

allowed to proceed under the statute to win, the first

12

step of what you have to do.

13

says is what is carved out, what is a wholesale -- and

14

this Court said in Mottaz, a retention of immunity, even

15

in the face of arguments that the government has done

16

wrong administratively, as in Mottaz.

17

do -- have done is retain immunity.

But what subsection (a)

What you

18

When the -- the section here right under the

19

sentence I read, Justice Scalia, about this section does

20

not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands, what that

21

meant was that this -- that Congress, against a backdrop

22

of complete immunity, said:

23

we've studied what we're doing, and we are not doing two

24

things, and we're going to be explicit about it.

25

not letting you touch Indian lands.

We've looked at lands,

You can say that again and

3

again, counsel, but it does say "under this section."

And I don't -- I don't know how you get out from under

that.

It says "under this section."

6

MS. MILLETT:

This --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if this section applies

8

only to suits seeking to assert title on the part of a

9

MS. MILLETT:

They are -- this section is, I

11

think, defined by what Congress's waiver of sovereign

But that -- but you

17

don't -- you can't believe that totally because you

18

agree there is some APA review of an action brought

19

before the title shifts where, the claim is, you cannot

20

take title, Secretary.

21

bring some.

You agree with that.

22

MS. MILLETT:

Absolutely.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

You can

Before title --

Once you agree to

24

that, I stop at the words, not just "under this

25

section," but "to adjudicate a disputed title to real
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

property."

2

Then I read his complaint.

His complaint, on

3

31 to 38, is asking for an injunction, and it's asking

4

for an injunction before they take any title to the

5

property.

6

but is there some other complaint that I didn't read?

7

Is there some amendment to the complaint in the record?

8

If so, where is it?

9

And maybe they went ahead and did it anyway,

MS. MILLETT:

I think there's a constructive

10

amendment in this sense, because if it's only

11

thing with --

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know what a

constructive amendment is.

MS. MILLETT:

Well, let me see if I can

16

which was untimely filed for purposes of the protection

17

of the government's not taking it into -- into trust,

18

but the set -- it did seek to stop the decision from

19

happening.

20

If I can explain.

To be sure, the complaint,

After that happened, when he did not seek

21

appeal or emergency relief from the district court not

22

giving him the injunction he asked for -- he asked for a

23

preliminary injunction to stop the taking of title.

24

The

He didn't do that.

This is the way litigation works.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Quiet Title

I thought you were going to

answer how his -- his complaint constructively changed.
MS. MILLETT:

10

And so after that, he had two

11

choices.

12

But what happened is he continued to press -- and this is

13

on page 25 of his brief, his court of appeals brief, at

14

page 26 and 27 -- he wants an injunction now, not to stop

15

title, but to take title out.

16

Title Act --

17

He could have dismissed the action as moot.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's when the Quiet

I thought you were going to

tell us how it constructively changed to be an action

what the QTA covers.

MS. MILLETT:

The Quiet Title Act, when it

3

says -- when it says the only way we'll give you a

4

relief is if you can establish that you have an interest

5

in the land, forecloses suits seeking to adjudicate --

6

adjudicate, excuse me -- disputed U.S. title by those

7

who don't even have an interest.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MS. MILLETT:

10

Counsel --

And against the back -- I'm

sorry.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you're assuming

12

that the statute was passed against a backdrop of

13

complete sovereign immunity, but if you look at Larson

14

and Malone, it appears as if prior to the enactment of

15

the QTA, people could bring suits to say that an officer

16

had acted beyond his or her statutory authority.

17

what the Quiet Title Act did was encapsulate some of

18

that law.

19

So

From where do we draw the conclusion that the

20

intent was to eliminate every other claim that could be

21

brought under something like the APA, or an officer

22

suit?

23

MS. MILLETT:

To be clear, as Justice Scalia

24

himself then testified before Congress, the law was a

25

mess, and you could not discern anything from Larson,
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Malone.

And the one area where actually courts have

2

pretty consistently denied relief, as Justice Scalia

3

then said, was in the land area.

4

And Congress responded to hardship, but in

5

doing so, it was making a critical balance.

6

disruptive to government it is to pull the rug out from

7

under the feet of the Federal Government's operations.

It knew how

And -- and it said we're going to draw lines,
and there's three lines.

1

valid authority under that Act because the Secretary

2

shouldn't have taken the land into title.

3

Now, that is not a quiet title action.

4

is a nuisance action.

5

that suit?

6

That

Can he have that adjudicated in

MS. MILLETT:

He could -- he could bring a

7

nuisance action, assuming the tribe waives sovereign

8

immunity, which would be its own problem.

9

I'm assuming this is a suit against the tribe and not

10

Assuming --

the Secretary.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MS. MILLETT:

Right, right.

And so there'd be their own

13

either State law or sovereign immunity questions, if he

14

could bring it.

15

raise this as -- or, excuse me, the tribe raised it as a

16

preemption defense, then there would be a separate

17

question whether at that point a court could issue,

18

consistent with the Quiet Title Act, a declaratory

19

judgment which would pull the rug out from the

20

government's feet.

21

And then if the government tried to

Right.

1

MS. MILLETT:

There's no question he could

2

bring a -- assuming tribal sovereign immunity, that he

3

could bring a nuisance action, but it's also important

4

to remember in that context, the other reason that

5

nuisance action would fail is that the courts have

6

already ruled on this claim about the legitimacy of

7

authorization of gambling, about the environmental

8

effects and the esthetic effects in the MichGO

9

litigation.

10
11
12
13

This is simply recycled through the IRA

claims that have already been adjudicated and lost.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that's a

question that's not before us.
MS. MILLETT:

So -- but with respect to the

14

question of judicial review that was mentioned earlier

15

and I think would be implicated, obviously, in a

nuisance action for -- this is sort of being

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW T. NELSON

MR. NELSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

This is a classic APA action.

Mr. Patchak is

2

challenging unlawful agency action.

Mr. Patchak is not

3

asserting a quiet title action where someone asserts an

4

interest in property owned by the government and is

5

trying to get that property back.

6

And as this Court has already discussed, the

7

best evidence of that is the fact that Mr. Patchak filed

8

this suit before the land was taken into trust.

9

fact that the government subsequently took the land did

10

not affect the nature of Mr. Patchak's lawsuit.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he didn't file it

12

within the 30-day window, so that -- that is -- there

13

was a clear track.

14

and at least the government tells us that that would

15

have been subject to judicial review, the ruling made

16

within -- that nothing would go on until that action was

17

cleared.

18

He could have filed within 30 days,

So why -- if he could have sued early, before

19

any title transfer, why isn't that all the relief

20

someone in his position would be entitled to?

21

should he be allowed to wait?

22
23
24
25

Why

I mean, the whole purpose of the 30-day
window is to get people to state their objections.
MR. NELSON:

Justice Ginsburg, the 30-day

window is a notice period.

Mr. Patchak did in fact file
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

his lawsuit within the 6-year statute of limitations

2

provided by Congress for APA claims.

3

that the Secretary adopted the 30-day notice provision

4

is the very argument that we believe is misplaced here,

5

namely that the Quiet Title Act springs up to bar

6

judicial review after the land is taken into trust.

7

And the reason

We don't believe that's the case, because

8

Mr. Patchak is not asserting a Quiet Title Act action,

9

which is limited to those claims where someone says,

10

this is my property and I want it back or, with regard

11

to the government, at least pay me for it.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you say the 30-day

window only applies to quiet title actions.
MR. NELSON:

Your Honor, the 30-day

16

action, the 30-day window would apply.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely -- surely the 30-day

18

envisions comments by anybody, not just people who claim

19

to own the property, doesn't it?

20

MR. NELSON:

Your Honor, certainly it

21

provides for comments, in that people can come and

MR. NELSON:

Justice Sotomayor, Mr. Patchak

17

is seeking a declaratory judgment that the decision of

18

the Secretary that it can take land into trust for this

19

particular band of Indians is incorrect, and that

therefore, the decision to do so is ultra vires; and as

21

an incident to that relief, now that the government has

22

taken the land into trust, that the land now be taken

23

out of trust.

24
25

That does not convert this, though, into a
quiet title action, because Mr. Patchak is not asserting

There is a difficult question here.

The

22

difficult question is what happens if one brings an

ordinary APA suit before land is taken, before that suit

24

can be decided -- before that suit can be decided, the

25

government takes the land.

Does that transform it into
37

a quiet title action?

2

The obvious answer, which isn't obvious at

3

all, is that the answer is that it's a proper APA suit

4

if you bring it before they take it.

5

it after they take it, it's a quiet title action.

6

And -- and that would seem to me a first-blush answer.

7

And if you bring

But I haven't found -- I mean, that's a

8

question we don't -- I don't know if we have to answer

9

that question.

It seems to me quite difficult.

And I

10

don't know what authority there is.

argued in the briefs?

12

what -- you're thinking -- I think Justice Sotomayor is

13

thinking, well, and you just said you can bring it

after.

I don't know if you can bring it after.

MR. NELSON:

Thank you, Justice Breyer.

The fact that this -- the fact -- the fact

21

that the land is taken into trust does not transform the

22

action into a quiet title action simply because the

23

government --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because under your theory

2

of what -- what the APA permits you to do, anytime the

3

government takes land, whether into trust or for any

4

other purpose, the APA permits someone within 6 years,

5

with whatever definition of prudential standing you want

6

to give it, to come in after the taking and challenge

7

that it was ultra vires, that it was done improperly.

That's your theory.

Your Honor, the -- it depends in

part, I believe, at this -- at that point, based on

3

State law, what the effect of the Court's decision would

4

be.

5

under Michigan law, the land would vest in the intended

6

beneficiary, which is the tribe.

Would it render the trust status void?

7

If so,

If it -- if it does not, if the entire action

8

would be undone, the land would revert back to the prior

9

owner, which, to the best of my understanding, is a

10

company that involves ownership both by a group of Las

11

Vegas investors and also, to my understanding, the Band

12

itself; although I could be corrected on that.

Was that the -- I thought

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

further, has a provision about the public interest, but

not in the section that you're relying on.

MR. NELSON:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Justice Kennedy, I would point to the fact

13

that the land is authorized to be taken into trust for

14

Indians, and when land is taken into trust, it

15

necessarily implicates the use.

16

is implicated, anyone who is affected by that

use -- people who live in close proximity to that

land -- are within -- are arguably within the scope of

And as soon as the use

23

You -- do you go

Because there's nothing in 465 that

MR. NELSON:

Your Honor, I agree that section

465 does not specifically reference the public interest.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It does, however -- the intent in 465 is to have land

2

taken into trust.

3

separate the fact that the land is being taken into

4

trust from the specific use to which it is being put.

5

And I don't believe that you can

Congress authorized the land to be taken into

6

trust for a specific use.

And you can see, in fact,

7

that the government has reached the same conclusion.

8

When you look at the regulations that the Secretary has

9

adopted in consideration of section 465, they not only

10

address land use, the tribe has to identify the use to

11

which the land will be put, but they also require the

12

tribe to identify any conflicts of land use, which

13

clearly addresses the fact that other people are going

14

to be affected by the land use.

15

Consequently, those -- and we believe

16

those -- those regulations are subject to Chevron

17

deference because they fall within the scope of the

18

authority delegated to the Secretary, and they don't

19

conflict with the broad delegation there in the -- in

20

section 465.

21

So -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's helpful.

5

your argument was, yes, you should be allowed to do that

6

because, even though this was filed after title had

7

transferred, yours is just not a quiet title action.

8

And it's not a quiet title action because you're not

seeking title yourself.

Let's -- let's assume that you had filed this
I had understood that

10
11

Because I had

Isn't that your

argument?

12

MR. NELSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So your argument really has

14

nothing to do with the question of timing.

15

argument would be the same even if title had transferred

16

prior to your filing your lawsuit.

17

MR. NELSON:

Your

Your Honor, we believe that that

18

is a logical result, but we do not believe that the

19

Court needs to address that issue in this case because

20

our argument is much stronger than that because we did,

21

in fact, file suit before the land was taken into trust.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, as I understood your

23

brief, 49 pages of it were about one thing, and there's

In other words, all of your brief is

Your Honor, I would disagree

10

that it's our weakest point, but I do agree that

11

the -- that the logic here of the position that this is

12

not a Quiet Title Act action means that even if the

13

government acquires title to the land while the suit is

14

pending, that logically, it would then follow that the

15

action remains an APA action, and it is not converted

into a quiet title action.

problem if they didn't have that notice?

MR. NELSON:

Your Honor, there was the Eighth

Circuit decision -- I believe it was United States v.

10

which the Court there found that the lack of judicial

the legislative authority.

I don't think Justice

Scalia's argument was a bad argument.

I thought it was

20

21

take the view that any suit filed to review APA is not a

22

quiet title action, people could go upset government

23

title to property years and years later.

So therefore, I thought you -- yours is different

4

because you filed before they took title.

I'm uncertain of that distinction.

But as I say,

Now, your answer suggests you've been going

7

both ways.

Sometimes you think, well, it matters that

8

we filed before.

9

And other times, you think, no, it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Is that because you don't

11

have a theory as to why once the government takes it,

12

it's not a quiet title action?

Your Honor, the Quiet Title Act

14

by its terms requires that the person who is asserting

15

the action had an interest in the property.

the one that Justice Breyer has said.

Then it

doesn't -- and the one Justice Kagan repeated yet

you a reason, this is what the result of the statute

says.

reason why Congress would have wanted that distinction,

what would you say?

But if I say, just try to provide me with a

6

MR. NELSON:

Your Honor, I guess I would

7

first say that because relief under the APA is different

8

than relief under the Quiet Title Act, someone with a

9

right, title or interest in the property can assert the

10

same claim that Mr. Patchak can, in spite of the fact

11

that they have that right, title or interest, under the

12

APA, as long as they do not seek under the APA to quiet

13

title in themselves.

15

would -- this provision is there -- I'm sorry, Your

reason?

you the land, if it's -- if it's within, what, the 6

4

the -- the ruling of the court of appeals.

5

appeals held that it doesn't matter when the suit is

6

filed, and under the Court's analysis --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. MILLER:

9

The court of

All or nothing?

Okay.

-- it would be exactly the same,

even if it was filed later.

And I think the -- the

10

error in that analysis is -- is that the question here

11

is not whether Patchak's suit is a Quiet Title Act

12

action.

13

expressly or impliedly precludes relief under section

14

702, and the answer to that question is yes.

The question is whether the Quiet Title Act

And I'd just like to make two points about

15

I

16

that.

The first is that the general principle

17

recognized by this Court in Brown v. GSA and a number of

18

other cases is that when you have a narrowly drawn

19

remedial scheme for a particular subject, that that

20

precludes resort to more general remedies.

21

the Quiet Title Act is exactly such a scheme.

22

mechanism for adjudicating a disputed title to real

23

property in which the United States claims an interest,

24

and it has its own procedures, its own statute of

25

limitations -55

And here,
It's the

Official

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but -- but in saying

2

that you've just broadened it, or arguably, you have.

3

If -- if you think that the quiet title action is really

4

about the narrower set of cases, which is when a person

5

himself claims title, how can you get from that to say

6

that there is an express or an implied refusal of -- of

7

this kind of claim?

8
9

MR. MILLER:

I think -- for two reasons.

And

the first is, just that -- that first sentence of

10

2409a(a), which is, you know, to adjudicate a disputed

11

title to land on which the United States claims an

12

interest.

13

case is.

That's a perfect description of what this

14

And the second is that the last sentence of

15

section 702 directs our attention to whether the relief

16

is expressly or impliedly forbidden by another statute.

17

And the relief that is sought here is an order

18

compelling the Secretary to relinquish title on behalf

19

of the United States to this land.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -What specific -- do

21

other consequences other than the ability of the

22

Secretary to take land in trust flow from whether or not

23

a tribe is recognized in 1934?

24
25

MR. MILLER:

I -- I'm not aware of any.

not sure that there aren't any others, but -56

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

Do you have any

2

concern that the government will get hoist by its own

3

petard?

4

What your argument -- the conclusion to which

5

your argument leads is that this individual, or any

6

individual claiming that the government took title

7

incorrectly, can sue under the Quiet Title Act, even if

8

they don't claim that title was taken from them.

9
10

Are you sure that's good for the government?
MR. MILLER:

Well, this action would be

11

barred under the Quiet Title Act because the Quiet Title

12

Act expressly precludes this relief, where -- where

13

Indian trust land is at issue, where the relief that's

14

sought is an injunction compelling relinquishment of

15

title without the option of paying damages --

16
17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that's not the

only time the government takes land, right?
MR. MILLER:

Well, and the Quiet Title Act,

19

section (d), requires in a suit under the Quiet Title

20

Act the plaintiff to identify his interest in the land.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Miller, I

22

mentioned earlier your footnote 1 in your reply brief

23

about whether the time of filing question for sovereign

24

immunity purposes is limited to diversity cases.

25

Are there -- you cite one case.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Are there

Official

1

others going the other way?

2

MR. MILLER:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. MILLER:

5

I'm not aware of others, but -What --

-- I can't say with confidence

that there aren't any others.

6

One point I would make on that is just refer

7

you to the Florida Prepaid case from 1998, which was

8

about State sovereign immunity, and which explained that

9

a State may condition its waiver of sovereign immunity

10

and may change that in the course of the litigation.

11

And I think that's another analogy that might be

12

instructive here.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So this suit would

14

come out the other way if the person objecting was just

15

over the border in -- in Indiana, instead of in

16

Michigan?

17

as a diversity suit.

Because there would be -- it could be brought

18

MR. MILLER:

Well, it would --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. MILLER:

I'm assuming --

It would be still

21

be -- sovereign immunity would still apply.

Sovereign

22

immunity would bar relief, even if the basis for

23

jurisdiction were diversity rather than --

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

suit against the tribe, it would still be not a
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Even if it were a

Official

1

diversity action but a Federal cause of action?

2

MR. MILLER:

Our -- our point is that the

3

reason it's barred is because of sovereign immunity.

4

When -- the time of filing in diversity cases refers to

5

if the citizenship of the parties changes during the

6

course of the litigation.

7

understanding is that doesn't defeat diversity.

8

the nature of that exception.

9
10

That doesn't -- my

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

That's

Thank you,

counsel.
