ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For decades, the agency Congress charged

12

with administering the Real Estate Settlement Procedures

13

Act has construed that statute as prohibiting a lender

14

from accepting a charge for a real estate settlement

15

service it didn't provide, whether it accepts that

16

charge directly from a consumer or indirectly through

17

another service provider, and whether it shares that fee

18

with another provider or keeps it all for itself.

19

That interpretation is eminently reasonable

20

and is entitled to deference.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in fact -Mr. Russell, when you say

22

the agency in charge, am I right in thinking that HUD

23

and its successor -- they don't have any

24

suit-commencement authority?

25

MR. RUSSELL:

HUD does have authority to
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bring suits for injunctive relief for violations of

2

2607(b), and -- if that answers your question.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. RUSSELL:

For injunctive relief?

For injunctive relief.

That's

5

correct.

And that agency has long construed the

6

language of this provision as reaching all unearned fees

7

whether divided or not, and that interpretation of the

8

language we think is eminently reasonable.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Reaching all?

10

understand you.

11

all -- something fees, whether permitted --

12
13

You said it too fast.

MR. RUSSELL:

I didn't

All unearned fees, whether

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. RUSSELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Whether split or not.
How does this – just -- may

18

be a side issue, but I don't see how this is a fee for

19

service.

20

paying more money up front and getting a lower interest

21

rate later.

22

it's simply a question of -- of a loan term, how much

23

you borrow and what the interest rate is.

24
25

I mean, I thought points is simply a way of

It isn't supposed to be for any service;

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, you're right.

I do

think it's a side issue because the courts below didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

2

decide that, and Quicken didn't -JUSTICE BREYER:

So, what are we supposed to

3

do -- decide theoretically, in the context of a case

4

that does not involve paying a fee for a service that

5

doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that

6

doesn't exist?

7

MR. RUSSELL:

I think you can take it on the

8

same assumption that the court of appeals did, that the

9

fee was unearned, and decide the question presented.

10

But to answer your question, Congress

11

amended the statute specifically to overrule the Sixth

12

Circuit's decision in Graham, which held that loan

13

discount fees were not covered by the statute, in that

14

case involving a kickback.

15

that case involved origination fees.

16

that's correct.

17

could have an entire case about.

I know Quicken argues that
We don't think

But this is -- this is an issue you

JUSTICE BREYER:

How?

MR. RUSSELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

argument on the other side?

22

more money, i.e., borrowing less.

23

that means you borrow less.

24

is lower because you’ve borrowed less.

25

argument on the other side?

And -- but -What's -- what's the
A point is a way of paying
Since you pay more,

And so, your interest rate

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, what's the

Official

1

MR. RUSSELL:

The argument is Congress

2

specifically defined the term "real estate settlement

3

service" to include the origination of the loan, which

4

includes but is not limited to the funding of the loan.

5

And it did that in order to encompass kickbacks, at the

6

very least, involving loan discount points, which was

7

what is at issue in Graham.

8
9

Now, you can have debates -- and we will
have in this case eventually debates about what does it

10

mean for a loan discount fee to be unearned.

11

present purposes, the circuit split arose here in the much

12

more common circumstance, when there are unearned fees

13

for appraisals and courier fees, and -- and that's what

14

the lower court decided on the basis of.

15

so --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But for

And it did

Well, I suppose if -- if

17

the lower court could have been wrong for either one of

18

two reasons, we don't have to decide which of the two

19

we -- we're precluded from considering, right?

20
21
22

MR. RUSSELL:

No, I don't think you're

precluded from considering -- I -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it’s -- it would be

23

just as well to say that the question presented here

24

decides the case as it would be to say that the question

25

raised by Justice Breyer decides the case, right?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. RUSSELL:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Right.

I --

And is there any reason to

put the one before the other?

4

MR. RUSSELL:

There are several reasons.

5

One is the lower courts did not address this question.

6

Quicken hasn't briefed it to any extent.

7

doesn't ask you to decide it on the base of that

8

question.

9

question that involves interpretation of another

We haven't briefed it.

Quicken

It's a complicated

10

provision of the statute that Congress amended to deal

11

specifically with this problem.

12

solve -- it wouldn't resolve the circuit conflict that

13

the Court granted cert to decide.

14

And it wouldn't

And so, if I could turn to that, if you look

15

at the language of the statute, which is reproduced on

16

page 6a of the -- the blue brief, in the words of the

17

statute, a lender who charges an unearned fee, accepts,

18

within the meaning of the statute, a portion, split, or

19

percentage, i.e., 100 percent, of a charge that was made

20

for the rendering of a covered real estate settlement

21

service other than for services actually performed.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- your argument

23

that "percentage" can include 100 percent is certainly

24

true as a matter of logic.

25

split, or percentage," I think the more natural reading

But in the phrase "portion,

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of "percentage" is something less than 100 percent.

2

other words, you're apportioning or you're splitting the

3

fee with somebody else.

4

MR. RUSSELL:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think -You could have --

6

"portion" I suppose could still mean a full portion;

7

"split" probably not.

8

reading is surely a division.

9

In

But, I mean, the more natural

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I think "portion" is the

10

word that best fits this situation.

11

used the phrase "portion" in other state -- in other

12

statutes to prohibit, for example, a public official

13

from converting to personal use any portion of the funds

14

entrusted to him --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And Congress has

It could mean that, but it

16

need not mean that.

17

-- just part and not whole; and which of the two it

18

means is often decided by the other words with which

19

it's associated.

20

says, you know, "tacks, nails, and" -- what?

21

nails, and wooden pegs," it's clear that "nails" doesn't

22

mean toenails; it -- it means a fastener.

23

It could mean either that or just

I mean, if you have a phrase that
"Tacks,

And so, also here, when it says "portion,

24

split, or percentage," it seems to me the natural

25

reading is that portion or percentage means not, as it
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

could mean, the whole, but rather just a portion.
MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I would -- I would say

3

two things about that.

4

statute that forbids somebody from taking any portion of

5

something, I think the ordinary understanding is that

6

prohibits them from taking the whole of the thing.

7

embezzlement statutes are an example of that.

8
9
10

One is that when you have a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

That's not what we have.

We have -- we have a statute that says you shall not
take any portion or split.

11

MR. RUSSELL:

Right.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. RUSSELL:

Okay?

And so, the canon, though, I

14

don't think, is a canon that says when you have related

15

words, you give them all the same meaning.

16

certainly have something in common.

17

measure of something, but the canon doesn't say that you

18

read them to all mean the same measure of something,

19

which would run headlong, I think, into the canon

20

against construing statutes to have surplusage.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

They're all the

But the -- one

22

reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this

23

covers partial, so it must cover 100 percent, is that

24

it's a very different issue if you're talking about

25

partial and 100 percent.

If you're talking about
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

partial, you have a classic case of a -- a kickback.

2

But if you suddenly say 100 percent of an unearned fee,

3

that's a much more difficult question to decide.

4

In this case, for example, you get a whole

5

bunch of things from Quicken Loans, including the loan

6

and all this other stuff, and it's kind of hard to

7

single out, well, this part is unearned but this part is

8

earned; it's kind of a whole package.

9

portion or split, it's an entirely different issue.
MR. RUSSELL:

10

When you have a

Well, you still have to

11

decide, when you're talking about a kickback, whether

12

the person who received the kickback has done anything

13

to earn their portion of it.

14

avoid the question of what does it mean for a fee to be

15

unearned entirely.

16

And so, I don't think you

Yes, but there --

17

it's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you're talking

about a portion.

20

the loan company really had anything to do with the

21

appraisal at all.

Let's say the kickback goes to the

Maybe you can decide in that case whether

22

When the alleged unearned fee goes to the

23

whole loan company, it's a little harder to say which

24

part was unearned and which parts might have been

25

earned.

But --

thing whether you pay 10 percent and no points or 9

5

percent and 3 points.

6

earned or unearned, it's kind of hard to sort it out.

7

I mean, it's the same

You know, which one of those is

It's certainly harder to sort

out with respect to loan discount fees.

MR. RUSSELL:

And the

What a consumer is paying

Yes.

If she has been charged for an

6

appraisal, what she is giving the charge for is for the

7

appraisal.

8

shows she didn't get what she paid for, but it doesn't

9

change what she was paying "for."

10

If the appraisal wasn't performed, that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now --

So, you -- I don't

11

understand that.

It's my fault.

But wouldn't -- it

12

says that if she doesn't get the appraisal, but she has

13

to pay for it, then why isn't she -- why hasn't -- why

14

doesn't she fall within the statute?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

I think that there are two

16

ways you can construe what it means to pay a charge for.

17

One is what it is you actually got --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. RUSSELL:

What you got was nothing.

-- which was nothing.

The

20

other is what you are actually charged for, which was

21

the appraisal.

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. RUSSELL:

24
25

And I think that latter

interpretation -JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. RUSSELL:

It's --

I think it's the most natural --

-- is the proper one.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why hasn't the consumer

violated?

5

MR. RUSSELL:

Because she didn't pay for

6

services other than -- she didn't pay for services other

7

than services actually performed.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

What she paid for --

Then why is the bank

liable?
MR. RUSSELL:

10

Because I think it's

different, depending on whether you're looking from the

perspective of accepting or receiving, what the charge

13

is for.

14

mechanic and you were charged for an oil change but you

15

didn't get one, it would be perfectly natural for you to

16

say I was charged for and I paid for an oil change.

So, for example, if you were to go to your

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

So, this -- you're

18

saying when the bank writes down, "pay $100 for the

20

service.

Right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Give me an example of where

I think in -Have you deprived it of all

effect?
MR. RUSSELL:

No.

In a traditional kickback

7

situation, where Quicken, for example, kicked back some

8

of the fee to a real estate agent for nothing, for the

9

referral of the business, which isn't for a service

10

actually performed within the meaning of the statute,

11

that would violate the provision.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then we have Quicken

13

as the giver and the person who receives the referral or

14

kickback as the receiver.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

That's correct.

This

16

provision does double duty.

17

broadly to encompass both traditional kickback

18

situations and unearned fee provisions.

19

It is designed and written

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Russell, there's one

20

puzzling aspect of -- of your interpretation.

21

be a rather large thing for Congress to say we're going

22

to cover overcharges, as I believe HUD says is --

23

counts; and yet, in the -- in the purposes of the Act on

24

page 1 of the appendix, it says nothing about

25

overcharges, nothing about payment for a service not
15
Alderson Reporting Company

It would

Official

1

received in the -- in the four -- "it is the purpose of

2

the Act to," and then there are four things listed, and

3

none of those say to stop charges for services that

4

weren't performed.

5

MR. RUSSELL:

That's true.

First, just to

6

clarify, we don't -- we're not arguing that it covers

7

overcharges in the sense of excessive charges.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that is -- that is

HUD's interpretation?
MR. RUSSELL:

10

That is one of HUD's

11

interpretations, although it's an interpretation about

12

what it means for something to be unearned, not having

13

anything to do with whether split fees are covered or

14

not.
But to answer your more specific question,

15
16

we know that that enumeration is not comprehensive.

17

There are other things in the statute that are not

18

included.

19

And the general purpose of the statute -JUSTICE SCALIA:

But nothing as big as this,

20

if you accept HUD's interpretation of this, which is

21

essentially the issuance of a -- of a price schedule by

22

HUD, and anything above these prices is an overcharge

23

and hence falls under -- under this provision.

24

immense.

25

MR. RUSSELL:

That's

It would be immense, but this
16

2

3

No, but if we don't, then

4

we reject deference to HUD, which you want us to -- to

5

apply.

6

MR. RUSSELL:

But as --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We can't at one time -- at

one and the same time, give deference to HUD and yet

9

disagree with what HUD says.
MR. RUSSELL:

10

Certainly you can, and, in

11

fact, Your Honor did in Smith v. City of Jackson, where

12

you held that a provision of a regulation recognizing

13

disparate impact was entitled to deference, but a

14

provision saying what you had to prove to show a

15

disparate impact violation wasn't.

16

similarly -- I mean, particularly the overcharge part of

17

the interpretation is not even in the regulations.

18

in the policy statement.

19

And here

It's

It's a subsequent --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you think this is

20

just a labeling statute?

21

it wanted, bottom line, but if it breaks it down into

22

categories and it doesn't do something that's actually

23

attributable to one of those categories, then there's a

24

violation?

25

MR. RUSSELL:

Quicken could charge whatever

I think Congress -- yes.

mean, it is -- labels are important, because Congress

2

didn't say you simply have to disclose the bottom line;

represent services that were actually rendered is a

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, it is --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, we have a statute

20

that looks like a kickback statute, and the reason it

21

looks like a kickback statute is it refers both to the

22

person giving and to the persons receiving, and it seems

23

to make them equally liable.

MS. O'CONNELL:

7

the policy statement, which is in the appendix to the

Petitioners' brief at 33a, says that HUD would be

unlikely to bring an enforcement action against

The explanation is

consumers for the payment of unearned fees.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, you mean it's all

prosecutorial discretion?

In other words, if you happen

13

to be a consumer you just have to rely on the goodwill

of the prosecutor; is that the idea?

What HUD is explaining is

This is HUD's interpretation of the statute

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does HUD have expertise in

interpreting criminal statutes?
MS. O'CONNELL:

10

HUD is -- has an expertise

in -- in determining what is earned and unearned and

12

what the practices are in the real estate industry for

13

charging consumers fees that haven't been earned by the

14

service providers.

What HUD is saying in the policy --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Well, but I assume that

16

HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours

17

must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt so that

18

if there's any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard

19

rule.

20

for the interpretation that favors the defendant.

22

ambiguous.

you're right.

25

If there's a genuine ambiguity, you -- you find
And

And you are telling me -- well, I guess
I guess HUD is favoring what would be the

MS. O'CONNELL:

If -- yes, it -- it's saying
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it doesn't think that a consumer violates the

2

statute because the consumer doesn't pay the fee other

3

than for services actually performed.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But can you -- I don't want

5

to take all your time on this because to me the more

6

important problem was the problem of the difference

7

between a kickback statute, which we could understand as

8

well within HUD's expertise and normal and of course

9

very good reason for doing it.

But a price control

10

statute, where we have the Federal agency deciding

11

whether the prices are accurate for each service that is

12

rendered or whether some percentage or all of it

13

represents service for nothing -- that's a rather big

14

novelty in American life.

15

they are usually Federal agencies that have a system

16

set up for determining proper prices and so forth.

17

That is, we have it, but

So, it's hard for me to believe that sort of

18

inadvertently Congress brought in the second under the

19

guise of the first without a big fuss being raised and a

20

big debate and so forth.

21

MS. O'CONNELL:

Justice Breyer, I think the

22

important -- important point here is that this is not an

23

overcharge case; this is an unearned fee case.

24

Overcharges are included in the 2001 policy statement,

25

but there is a basis in the statute to differentiate
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between overcharges and unearned fees, and HUD has long

2

taken the position that undivided unearned fees, a fee

3

for which no service is performed, violates section

4

2607(b).

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure.

It

6

seems to me that even under the Respondent's view of the

7

statute, you have to inquire into reasonableness to see

8

if the fee was earned.

9

MS. O'CONNELL:

At some point, under

10

anybody's interpretation, there does have to be a

11

determination of whether something was earned.

12

there is a statutory basis to distinguish between an

13

unearned fee and an overcharge in that the service has

14

to be -- the fee has to be other than for services

15

actually performed.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait a minute.

But

If -- you

17

know, if -- if I charge you an exorbitant amount for

18

cutting down a tree, you know, 2,000, $20,000, and then

19

I present my bill, you would say that I have not earned

20

it simply because it's exorbitant?
There --

12

points, they would still get a rate of 8 percent?

MS. O'CONNELL:

Right.

Our understanding is

that when -- the Petitioners in this case got a quote

15

for their mortgage loan from Quicken over the phone at a

16

particular interest rate with no mention of points.

17

When it came time to pay the settlement charges, they

were charged a loan discount fee, charged points to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. HEFFERON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HEFFERON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In passing RESPA in 1974, Congress was
stepping into the middle of a primarily local market
28

controlled by State law.

2

doing so, Congress tread carefully.

3

two things in the area of settlement charges.

4

The statute shows that, in
It did primarily

5

and increase disclosure of charges, including requiring

6

a written estimate of charges to be given to people

7

weeks before the closing.

that price controls might be advisable.

1

First of all, with respect to the transactions that

2

relate to charges actually paid at the closing, it

3

eliminates the need to prove an agreement.

4

all it says is that there will be a violation if you

5

follow the money and the money ends up in the hands --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All it --

Well, if that's the case, I

7

mean, why would Congress have done something that says

8

(a) pursuant to an agreement, (b) not pursuant to an

9

agreement?

10

Why wouldn't it just have one provision that

didn't make any reference to an agreement?

11

MR. HEFFERON:

Because (a) covers an entire

12

universe of things which appear, in many instances, away

13

from the closing table.

14

between an attorney and a developer that the attorney

15

says I will do all the title work on the raw land for

16

this development if you later on send me the closings

17

when you build on the land and sell the particular

18

parcels.

19

For example, an agreement

If there was no agreement requirement,

20

agreement for referral, if that did not appear in (a),

21

then any relationship between two people in the

22

settlement service business would be presumptively a

23

kickback.

24

And so, you had to have that.

Yes, well, (a) -- the

so-called kickback in (a) is not for services not

We don't believe that it is

1

In most instances, it would probably be provable as a

2

kickback under 2607(a) since, in normal circumstance,

3

one doesn't give all of one's fee away unless there's

4

something else going on, typically in this instance a

5

referral.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that -- does that

7

make much sense that if you give one meaning -- if you

8

stay consistent with your meaning, what you're saying is

9

a situation where the service provider gives away

10

everything, 100 percent, they're just not liable under

(b)?

Congress was trying to take a measured step here because

it was for the first time stepping into this local

market.

If the Court would find that

5

"portion, split, or percentage" covers 100 percent, then

6

we would agree with Judge Higginbotham that it would --

that a -- liability would not go any further than a

Is this 100 percent

In Long Island Care at Home,

the Court merely repeated in particular statements made

in Chevron and Mead that, among other things, a

23

regulation cannot get deference unless it -- if it is

24

procedurally defective.

25

talked about the fact that a circumstance sometimes

occurred, which is one reason why regulation X should

not get special deference from this Court.

MR. HEFFERON:

What it is, is it is

analysis.

recount that this is a -- a reading which is of long

standing, when we believe -- and we cite in the -- in

out examples in the red brief where it isn't a finding of

16

aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at

way, and instead leave other remedies in place.

be.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did you give a complete

answer to the question what does (b) cover that (a) does
52
Alderson Reporting Company

not?

So, one suggestion that's made is, well, you

2

didn't -- if all this statute has to do -- do with is

3

kickbacks, then all you need is (a), and there's no

4

necessity for (b).

5

proving a contract, and not -- is there anything else?

6

You said one thing is contract,

MR. HEFFERON:

Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.

7

Actually, I didn't give a complete answer now that I

8

recall.

9

classic reason why the -- this section was put in, in

It does cover -- the best example is the

10

the first place, why it was proposed; and that would be

11

an unearned commission.

12

the time would enter into commission agreements with

13

agents where the agent would get 10 percent of the title

14

premium; in exchange, the agent would do the title work.

15

In a situation -- if the title agent in fact

Title insurance companies at

16

didn't do the title work, it would be receiving an

17

unearned fee, that is, part of the title insurance

18

commission, for no work.

19

normally be covered under (a) because the agreement, the

20

underlying agreement to give the commission was not to

21

refer business; it was actually to do some of the title

22

work.

23

And that, however, would not

So, that situation would be covered, but

24

most situations, as I think all parties agree, this

25

statute is -- is typically a kickback.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

removes the agreement requirement.

(b) there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay the

agreement to pay it for no work.

13

MR. HEFFERON:

14

So, in sum, the elements of the Fifth

15

Circuit's interpretation are all supportive of our view,

16

that is, that the language, the structure, the context,

17

and the history of this statute all show that it is

18

important, but it's limited; and it does not address

19

MR. HEFFERON:

If the -- I think the

question was in the context of the title agent doing the

title work.

4

charging the consumer directly and not doing the work,

5

it would not violate the statute, again, because the

6

statute requires two providers.

If an appraiser was charging -- was

If the bank arranged for a

12

title searcher to do title work, and then the bank

13

charged the consumer, and then it split the charge with

14

the title searcher -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

No, no.

So, going back

16

to Justice Scalia's question, if the provider decides

17

I'm going to use what I had before, I'm not going to

redo the work, but still charges you a second time,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. RUSSELL:

13

Justice Breyer, you had asked why Congress

14

would engage in a statute that gets at overcharges and

15

has a rate regulation kind of thing, which is very

16

unusual, and I agree it's unusual.

17

read this statute not to do that, to only get at truly

18

unearned fees, which are the equivalent of fraudulent

19

fees, which the law does forbid pervasively.

21

Thank you.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a reason to

And the policy statement is

What they are thinking of is overcharges,

MR. RUSSELL:

No, I don't think that's

correct.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. RUSSELL:

No?

I think that there was a

8

two-step analysis.

The first step is they decided that

9

split fees are not the only thing that the statute gets

10

at.

And then -- but this -- an unsplit fee still has to

11

be unearned, and they had a separate interpretation of

12

what it means for a fee to be unearned.

The difference between unearned

MR. RUSSELL:

It's towards the end where

they enumerate the different kinds of unearned fees.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It's right here.

It's on

21

-- it's on 53,057.

And what they're explaining is that,

22

and they're talking about a third situation, and they

23

say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a

24

consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the

25

reasonable value of the services performed by that
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provider.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

That's correct.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

They are --

And so, if it exceeds the

4

reasonable value of the services performed by that

5

provider, you have to say what is the reasonable value

6

of the services performed by that provider.

7

involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair

8

or just price for this particular service.

9

MR. RUSSELL:

And that

I'm not -- I'm not disagreeing

10

with you about that.

11

three or four different kinds of charges that could be

12

unearned.

13

respect to each of those things, about --

14

They list four different -- or

You don't have to agree with them with

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but what I'm doing

15

there, you see, is now I'm trying to make sense out of

16

an agency interpretation which is other than what it

17

says, where what they're trying to do is to change the

18

nature of the statute from a kickback statute into a

19

statute that protects consumers across the board from

20

paying for things they don't get.

21

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I would --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that's where I'm sort

23

of interested in what the legislative history said, et

24

cetera, et cetera.

It's much more complicated than I

25

thought coming in.

I have to look at a lot of things.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. RUSSELL:

Sure.

What Congress said its

2

purpose was, was to get at abusive practices that

3

unnecessarily increase the costs of settlement.

4

the legislative history was focused on kickbacks, but

5

there were examples in the HUD/VA report, at page 16 of

6

that report, and in the Washington Post articles about

7

markups that are a form of undivided, unearned fee.

What --

8

Congress knew -- subsequent to the passage

9

of this statute, HUD has frequently found and reported

10

to Congress incidents of unearned fees, including those

11

involving loan discount fees.

12

States have filed a brief in this case telling you that

13

there is a pervasive problem with settlement closings

14

included padded charges for things that were never

15

performed.

16

And the States -- 21

With respect to the agency's interpretation,

17

I would point you particularly to this 1996 rulemaking,

18

where the agency withdrew an exemption for certain

19

payments between consumers and providers for the use of

20

a particular kind of computer service.

21

would have been unnecessary had HUD thought, as Quicken

22

does, that the statute only regulates transactions

23

between providers.

24
25

That exemption

And in withdrawing that exemption, HUD
explained in quite a lot of detail that it rejected
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

specifically that -- the split fee requirement.

2

I don't think there's any question that they've grappled

3

with this question and that they've explained why they

4

think that split fees aren't covered.

5

And so,

The question ultimately is whether that's a

6

reasonable conclusion in light of the language of this

7

statute --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then part of that is --

you might want to say something about the other part.

I

10

mean, the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is

11

to prevent agencies, seeing the supreme importance of

12

their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and

13

in particular transforming into a criminal law something

14

that really wasn't much there.

15

Now, procedure is important in that.

And

16

that's why I'm very interested in whether -- whether

17

they gave notice to the public:

18

thinking that this is far more than a kickback statute.

19

MR. RUSSELL:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21
22

Dear public, we are

They gave -We would like to hear what

you think about that.
MR. RUSSELL:

They gave the public more

23

notice than the Court found sufficient in Long Island

24

Care at Home, which is they -- they told the public this

25

provision is at issue; we're going to issue an
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation about it.

2

Long Island Care, they did the opposite of what they had

3

proposed to do, and this Court said that was enough.

4

this case, and even in 1996, they received comments with

5

respect to the case law that said that only splits are

6

required, and they said we disagree.

7
8
9
10
11

And they ultimately did.
