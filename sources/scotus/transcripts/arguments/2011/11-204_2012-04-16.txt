ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

11

In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress

12

directed the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote "define

13

and delimit" the statute's outside salesman exemption.

14

By regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside

15

salesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting

16

sales by others.

17

elaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either,

18

one, a conversation where there can be no commitment or,

19

two, one where there will be no exchange with the

20

employer.

21

In further guidance, the Secretary

Now, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical

22

detailer engages in promotion.

They tout drugs to

23

doctors.

24

commitment to issue a prescription.

25

that a prescription is not an exchange with a

pharmaceutical company.

2

argues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly

3

to doctors as a matter of law.

4

from the fact that the Secretary's regulation

5

incorporates the definition of "sale" in the FLSA, which

6

is in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1.

7

But nonetheless, the Respondent

They say that follows

That definition, which is section 203(k),

8

provides -- it's the second provision on the page --

9

"'sale' or 'sell' includes any sale, exchange, contract

10

to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or

11

other disposition."

12

language is anything that contradicts the two points the

13

Secretary has made, which is that there has to be a

14

commitment or that, at the very least, there has to be

15

an exchange with the employer.

16

And what you will not find in that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, is that consistent

with the Government's argument?

does -- does the consignor actually transfer title to

23

the property at issue?

actually very heavily restricted.

that the employee is doing to further the employment

relationship is going to be hours on duty.

But whatever it is

It is really

10

important I think that while it is true that a

11

pharmaceutical detailer has many of the characteristics

12

of an outside salesman, the one they don't have is

13

selling.

14
15

And that is the line that Congress drew.

they absolutely are.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there any occupations

or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor

10

Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are

11

out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth.

12

words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent,

13

would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas

14

that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they

15

wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other

16

classifications to fit them in?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

In other

I would, but they would all

18

be one of two things.

They would either fall within the

19

administrative exemption, which is, Justice Ginsburg,

20

what is -- Congress was talking about when it talked about

21

people who have a lot of autonomy, and which is not true

22

of detailers -- or some other exemption.

23

example, certain outside buyers are exempt under the

24

Fair Labor Standards Act.

25

example, because if you're an outside buyer of poultry,

So, to give an

A good -- that's a good

Alderson Reporting Company

12

then you are exempt, but if you are an outside buyer of

2

meat, you aren't.

3

It is one of a lot of different places --

4

there are 50-some exemptions from the Fair Labor

5

Standards Act.

6
7

And Congress drew incredibly fine lines.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress can draw -- draw

even silly lines.

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
If Congress draws it, it's

10

a line.

But the line you're suggesting here -- both

11

your brief and the Government's, as I recall, say, my

12

goodness, if we find for the Respondent here, there'll

13

be so much uncertainty in the future.

14

there isn't a lot of uncertainty if we -- if we find in

15

your direction.

16

I'm not sure

Now, let me give you an example.

One of my

17

law clerks -- my law clerks supplement my sparse life

18

experience.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

One of my law clerks is

21

familiar with the -- the framing business.

Okay?

Now,

22

salesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time

23

that they visit the -- the framing company or the

24

framing store.

25

future, that person will order from the framing company.

They get a commitment that in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

Now, is that a sale?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is a sale, but the

3

difference here is that there's neither a commitment --

4

remember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but there is a

6

commitment.

7

trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if

8

it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the

9

future.

10

There is a commitment to -- what they're

That's a commitment.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, if that is

11

the commitment, then all of promotion I think is going

12

to be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you

13

on the street saying will you try my product, will you

14

go into the store, is trying to get you to say I'll go

15

in.

16

you saying I'll consider it in an appropriate

17

circumstance.

18

And that is much more of a direct commitment than

The commitment by a doctor is precatory at

19

most.

20

that can be binding in any way that they will prescribe

21

a drug for anyone.

22

They do not make any commitment in any instance

And remember, there is the second -- the

23

second distinction.

So, that's one.

24

that -- remember, there is a purchase in your

25

hypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing

Alderson Reporting Company

But the second is

Official

14

store.

But the second part of the Secretary's guidance

2

is that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription,

3

they're not exchanging anything with the drug company.

4

There -- nothing is acquired from the drug company.

5

That is a very significant difference.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a peculiar line of

7

commerce.

8

constitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of

9

the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where

10
11

And -- and you're saying that what

you're selling to people who cannot make a commitment.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, there are two things.

12

The first is the commitment, and they are not selling

13

anything to the doctor.

14

industry, the pharmaceutical company sells its products;

15

it sells them to pharmaceutical wholesalers, which sell

16

them to pharmacies -- pardon me -- which sell them to

17

customers, which have a relationship with a doctor, who

18

may or may not have met with a detailer.

Remember, just to frame this

19

There is a sale here in this industry, but

20

it is to a pharmaceutical detailer, and that is a very

21

significant difference.

example that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which

is that there are outside buyers who do receive

8

nonetheless exempt.

And remember, of course, that there are

Congress didn't write an exemption

10

about commissions; it wrote them about whether it's an

11

outside person who engages in sales.

12

And the other point I was trying to make is

that -- and Justice Scalia echoed it to some extent --

14

and that is that the FLSA draws very fine lines.

MR. STEWART:

They have supplemented 3(k),

and they did that --

8
9

How can they

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's the authority to do

that?
MR. STEWART:

The -- this is discussed in

11

the Stein Report, which was issued in 1940, and what had

12

happened was that the question had arisen -- and the

13

Stein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail.

14

The question had arisen whether individuals who

15

negotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell

16

time -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell --

17

negotiate contracts for carriage of freight by rail or

18

truck -- the question arose whether they were outside

19

salesmen within the meaning of the statute.

20

And the Stein Report explained that the Wage

21

and Hour Division had taken the position that they were

22

not because it interpreted "sales" -- it appears to have

23

interpreted "sales" to refer only to sales of goods, and

24

people who were engaged in those sorts of businesses

25

were not selling goods.

But the Stein Report said:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19

However, these people are commonly regarded as salesmen;

2

the contracts they negotiate are treated as sales.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's wonderful.

4

Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the

5

question before us is whether it's arbitrary or

6

capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their

7

power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these

8

people look like salesmen to me.

9

And so, if they can do number (2) there, I

10

don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and

11

by the way, detailers are also included.

12

MR. STEWART:

whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.

position that, even though it has construed 3(k) to

17

refer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or

18

contracts for the use of facilities can be covered.

19

However, there's a big difference between the

20

interaction between a detailer and a physician and the

21

interaction between the -- the person who sells time on

22

the radio.

23

The person -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure there is; sure there

24

is.

But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't

25

have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20

the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really

2

have a different -- a different argument before us here.

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, the -- the theory on

4

which the Stein Report proceeded was that, even though

5

sales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they

6

were still customarily regarded as sales, and they had

7

the essential attributes of sales; namely, an exchange

8

of something valuable that the seller possessed in

9

return for consideration from the buyer.

And you don't

10

have any of that when the detailer deals with the --

11

with the --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, there's this

13

other regulation which is I guess in the coverage

14

section, 779.241, which says that if an employee

15

performs any work that in a practical sense is an

16

essential part of consummating the sale of the goods,

17

he'll be considered to be selling the goods.

18

So, I guess this question is a two-part

19

question.

20

the -- these detailers?

21

do, you know, how does it work that we should understand

22

"sale" one way for purposes of coverage and another way

23

for purposes of exemption?

24
25

Do you agree that that regulation does cover

MR. STEWART:

And the second part is, if you

Well, the first thing I would

say is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover

Alderson Reporting Company

detailers.

That is, if the relevant sales are, as we

2

believe, GSK's sales to -- the transfer of drugs to

3

wholesalers and pharmacies in return for consideration,

4

the detailers don't play an essential role in the

5

consummation of those sales.

6

those sales.

8

will make those sales more likely to occur, but we

9

wouldn't regard them as --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that seems a little bit

11

blind to the way the industry actually works.

12

this industry actually works is the real work is done by

13

the detailer getting the doctor to say, yes, I'm going

14

to start prescribing this where it's medically

15

appropriate.

17

detailer is.

21

That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what

22

Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've

23

seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly

24

balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who

25

work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years

Alderson Reporting Company

So you would think -- and it isn't the only

3

problem that has just been recognized in other

4

industries, too.

5

reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for

6

75 years, the right way to do it is to have notice and

7

comment, hearings, allow people to present their point

8

of view, and then make some rules or determine what

9

should happen.

If the agency is going to reverse, not

Perhaps they'd say for the future let's

10

do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the

11

past.

12

Perhaps they'd say some and not others.

Okay?

That's my instinctive reaction, not

13

necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law.

14

But why shouldn't I try to get there?

15

MR. STEWART:

I guess I'd say two things,

16

one general and one specific to detailers.

17

thing is that DOL has consistently drawn a distinction

18

between promotional work --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

6

7

not nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as --

8

9

MR. STEWART:

It seems to me that's

Well, with respect to where

10

the industry expectation arose, we have only one data

11

point or at least only one data point that has been

12

identified in the briefs.

13

Federation of Independent Small Business Legal Center

15

they -- they identify one DOL opinion letter, of which

16

we were previously unaware, that dates from 1945.

17

in the opinion letter, the employer of the detailer

18

asked for an opinion to the effect that its detailers

were covered by the administrative exemption.

And the agency has regarded

the application of its promotion sales regulations to

the facts of this case as clear.

GSK's highest level management why does it make sense to

employ detailers, they wouldn't say because they get

MR. STEWART:

Well, to the extent that there

was an industry expectation that was based on anything

25

on the 1945 opinion letter, which said not --

your attention.

8

MR. STEWART:

Again, our argument is not

that they should have known from the -- about the

10

opinion letter.

Our argument is that the proper

11

application of the promotion sales regulation to the

12

facts of this case is pretty clear, and that if GSK's

13

top-level management was asked to defend the use of

14

detailers, they would say these people are important

15

because if they persuade physicians to write more

16

prescriptions and those are filled with GSK products,

17

then pharmacies will reorder the drug and our

wholesalers will reorder it from us.

MR. CLEMENT:

The second limiting principle

is actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you

look at 503, which are the regulations that draw the

distinction between promotion and between being outside

10
11

What they say is it depends who does the
And as long as the outside salesperson does

And

what they're trying to -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it also says -- it

12

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Is not covered.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- is nonexempt.

You're right, but -And these sales -- I

18

mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a

19

pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

But, Justice Ginsburg, I think

21

it's important to recognize that the reason that 503

22

draws a distinction between promotional activity in

23

conjunction with the salesperson's own sales or

24

promotional activity with respect to somebody else's

25

sales is they're concerned about the consideration where

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

somebody else is going to follow up with the same

2

customer to close the deal.

3

And if you look at the regulatory

4

commentary, that's what they're concerned -- they don't

5

want to sort of have double counting, where somebody

6

promotes with a sales target and then somebody else

7

follows up to close the sale.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And --

Well, that might be one

thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be

10

the only thing.

11

regulations, it seems as though what they're trying to

12

do is draw a distinction between people who actually

13

consummate transactions, transactional people, and

14

people who are pitchmen.

15

of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make

16

pitches; they're not people who consummate the

17

transactions.

18

I mean, if you look at these

MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and what the Department

Well, Justice Kagan, I really

19

think if you look at the regulations as a whole and the

20

commentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report,

21

they're not worried about sorting out the pitchmen

22

because they understand that that classic outside

23

salesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a

24

commitment to buy or some other commitment from the

25

sales target.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

So, what they're trying to do is really

2

distinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people,

3

but between what they refer to as missionary men or

4

people who pave the way for somebody else to make the

5

sale.

6

regulation.

And I really think that's the focus of the 503

7

And so, the Government's argument really

8

boils down to the notion that there's nobody in this

9

industry that makes enough of a commitment with the

10

doctor for anybody to be involved in anything but

11

promotion with the doctor.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that seems -But why isn't that possible?

13

I mean, your brief seemed to suggest that in every

14

industry there needs to be some group of people who

15

would be classified as outside salesmen.

16

necessarily the case.

17

here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because

18

of other business practices, where there just isn't

19

anybody who's an outside salesman.

20

And that's not

There may be some industries, and

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kagan, it's

21

theoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially

22

in an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to

23

get a commitment to prescribe from the doctor.

person who walks in the door, prescribe them the

Government has expressed new concerns, has new

is not that the basic role of the outside salesperson

has changed, but the technology has changed in such a

way that it would be silly to draw a distinction between

14

whether the salesperson actually takes the order and

15

writes it down or gets a form in triplicate, or rather

16

gets a commitment to buy from the sales target who then

actually enters the order on a computer on their own.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Clement, I thought

24

that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one

25

was the proposal that was changed, and the other was the

proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to

2

allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside

3

salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that

4

suggestion.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but

6

there has always been an effort to try to get all

7

promotional people treated as being exempt.

8

different from what's being asked for here, which is the

9

last person who makes a visit to the person who places

But that's

10

the relevant order in the industry and gets the

Department's own flexible approach.

In the Department of Labor's response allowing that

21

exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use

22

the word "detailers," medical detailers, are engaged in

23

a form of promotional or missionary work.

The

obviously, that may depend a little bit on how the

2

particular role was described.

3

the 1945 opinion letter, I mean, that may be somewhat

4

different.

5

that promotional activity itself is not problematic.

6

Promotional activity is exempt as long as it's in

7

conjunction with the person's own sales or

8

solicitations, is the word of the regulation.

9

don't think that's dispositive.

10

If you're reading from

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, I

This goes -- the letter

11

goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a

12

form of promotion not having for its object the making

13

of specific transactions.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, and again, Justice

15

Ginsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no,

16

there is an interest in getting a specific commitment.

17

It is commitment to prescribe.

18

is non-binding, and it may be somewhat forward-looking,

19

but I don't think that distinguishes this industry from

20

many industries.

21

It may be somewhat -- it

It's not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But as far as your

22

70 years, it's suspect for two reasons.

23

told that in the early years, at least, before there

24

were regulations restricting the sale of prescription

25

drugs, that these detailers did two things.

Alderson Reporting Company

One is we're

They did

Official

41
1

have their informational function, but they also did

2

direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals.

3

So, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these

4

people were engaged in what the department would call

5

sales.

So, that's suspect.

6

And then when we have the commitment, the

7

opinion letter that says we have a category for these

8

people; they are engaged in instruction, in information;

9

they are not engaged in sales; but because they're so

10

independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the

11

particular case we rank them as administrative people.

12

So -- so, it's not so that there was a

13

sudden about-face as you suggest.

14

categorization as -- as administrative employees, but

15

not sales employees, and we have a history of these

16

detailers at one time actually selling.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

We have a

Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me

18

say -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment

19

has changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted

20

in this industry have changed, but I think the focus is

21

very much on the doctors appropriately because they're

22

the ones that place the order.

23

responsive to the administrative exemption.

that, too.

And I certainly don't want this Court to

8

think that the industry somehow has the administrative

9

exemption as an ace up their sleeve or in their back

10

pocket.

And it's really the same exact issue, because,

11

once again, the agency has changed their view.

12

again, their view is not based on anything that has to

13

on this industry.

"sale" and that define "promotion"?

else is not exempt.

Why not just look to the

Why do we get into the amicus brief when we

statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by

22

somebody else is not exempt?

MR. CLEMENT:

2

say why, if you're going to err on one side or the

3

other, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive

4

retroactive liability.

5

simple matter of deferring to that is because that same

6

regulation earlier says that promotional work is exempt

if it's in conjunction with the individual's own sales

8

or solicitations.

9

The reason that that's not a

Now, I happen to think it's pretty clear

10

that these -- by getting this commitment, which is the

functional equivalent of a commitment to buy, which is

12

what the regulations and the regulatory interpretations

have always said is a sale in some sense, I think these

14

are sales.

It's not this kind of outside

20

sales force.

It's a much less sales-oriented

transaction.

22

the example of a company that has 2,000 outside sales

23

reps and 10 people that handle the movement of transfer

24

of product to the wholesalers and the distributors.

25

If you look at district court's opinion at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

the page 42a of the petition appendix, the district

2

court addresses this issue and I think gets it exactly

3

right, which is the reason there isn't a sales effort

7

That's what drives sales in this

There's nothing anomalous about that.

If

8

you think about any industry, sales activity is always

9

directed at the people who place orders.

industry, because of the learned intermediary doctrine,

11

the person who places the order is the doctor, not the

ultimate end user.

point that the doctor then, when he sees the next

MR. CLEMENT:
sales, Your Honor.

I think they're probably two

But, you know, it's the same

10

thing -- imagine somebody who's, you know, just sitting

11

in their house, and they get an encyclopedia

12

salesperson.

13

buy that.

14

but you know, maybe the State law has a law that says

15

you've got to wait 24 hours before you put the order in,

16

in the computer.

17

And they say, you know, I'll -- maybe I'll

That looks good, I'll buy it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And they say,

But that's a firmer

commitment when they say I'll buy it.

just saying I'll think of your product when it -- when

20

the need comes up.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

The physician is

But -- well, if -- I mean,

22

what I was suggesting is maybe you're talking about a

23

State that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like

24

that.

enter the order in 24 hours.

So, it's a commitment that, sure, I'm going to

will certainly have finally had a sale.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One of the two people he's

I think,

But don't you think that the

7

way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it

8

works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer

9

provides information, the doctor says that's very

10

interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to

11

think about it.

12

journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and

13

talks to other doctors about the product.

14

Then the doctor reads some medical

I mean, that's what you would hope that a

15

doctor would do before a doctor decided I'm going to

16

start prescribing this medicine.

17

a part of that, but so are many other things before the

18

doctor actually decides to do something.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

And the detail work is

Sure, Justice Kagan.

But you

20

don't want to look at this like it's an isolated,

21

one-time, you know, sort of interaction.

22

the things that -- that happens in this industry, like

23

other sales industry, is there are multiple trips.

24

detailer goes there maybe the first time and lays the

25

ground work.

I mean, one of

Then maybe the doctor reads some other

Alderson Reporting Company

information.

2

that information is there, finally the detailer gets the

3

commitment to prescribe to appropriate patients.

4

Then maybe on the final visit, after all

I think one way to think about the absurdity

5

of making the difference turn on the prescription is to

6

compare this salesperson to another salesperson of

7

medical devices who goes in, but these are medical

8

supplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office.

Now, they're both hired for their sales experience.

They both get sales training.

13

their bags, and they both get a commitment from the

14

15

They both have a sales

They're sitting in the same doctor's waiting

Now, what sense does it make as a matter of

16

the FLSA and its labor policies to say one of those

17

people is exempt and the other one is not exempt,

18

because for perfectly sensible reasons, we say that one

19

of those products is a prescription where the doctor

20

writes the order and then with that order, the end user,

21

the ultimate end user, can make the purchase at the

22

pharmacy, whereas the other one --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Clement, I wanted to

or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or

5

What authorization is there for the agency
to invent number (ii)?

8

It says -- requires that the employee be

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, you

heard the Government's explanation; and, as you suggest,

10

if the Government's explanation is right, then this

11

shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to

12

3 -- to the 3(k) definition.

13

the 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that

14

definition, it has every hallmark of being broad and

15

functional and flexible.

16

I think, even though -- at

I would want to make one very important

17

point, though, about the ultimate question here, because

18

ultimately the decision whether to go one way or another

19

on this issue has remarkable significance for

20

retroactive imposition of liability.

21

We all know that retroactive rulemaking is

22

disfavored.

Well, think about the consequences here.

23

You have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of

24

effective time and a half, because of the way that the

25

statute works.

It has time and a half plus liquidated

5

6

You are talking about people who are very well
So, unlike the classic

Of course, the effort to try to reconstruct

7

these people's hours, given that they were told they

8

were exempt and they were outside the office, trying to

9

reconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked

10

is going to be a crapshoot at best.

11

about all of that, and then you think about, as

12

Justice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is

13

to --

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, if you think

Let's pursue this for a

second.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because I'd like to go back

18

to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me

19

speaking.

20

had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance.

21

would have said look at the statute; it says the

22

it in a brief?

24

but, yes.

I don't know how anybody else feels.

regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in

my opinion.

So, you tell me what to say.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- may I answer?

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Certainly.

I would start by citing -- I

know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court

23

opinions, but I'd start by citing Judge Posner's opinion

24

in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit -- they're a very

distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one

confront the retroactive consequences and in that sense

And I would just simply say this, which is

if you had a rulemaking, you could bring in all of the

14

affected parties, including the current sales

15

representatives, who are not the ones bringing these

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Three quick points.

First, if you read the

6

transcript, you will see that my friend says that the

7

nature of this job has changed.

8

essential part of understanding this case.

9

an entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on

And that is an
And there is

10

11

how very much the requirements of pharmaceutical

12

detailers and the restrictions on them have changed

13

dramatically over the last couple of decades in

14

particular.

15

70 years are wrong.

16

And that's why the continued references to

The other important point about the FLSA in

17

particular is that there is a statute on this issue, and

18

it says that an employer can request guidance from the

19

agency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has

20

no defense.

21

are 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover

22

hundreds of different categories of employees.

23

the rule you are going to announce -- because Mr.

24

Clement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any

25

precedent.

Its job is to ask for guidance.

And there

And if

If the rule you are going to now announce is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

that there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of

2

those, it's going to be an administrative nightmare.

3

Two quick further points.

The Department of

4

Labor's position is that there has to be an actual

5

commitment, not a precatory commitment.

6

says, well, that's contrary to the definition of "sale"

7

in 3(k).

8

find something in there, something that is not a

9

commitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a

of "commitment" a rule that says -- excuse me, in the

14

Every one of those things is

parts to it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

But there has to be the

11

agreement, a firm agreement.

It's repeated in the 2004

12

preamble to the regulations as well.

13

Now, the last critical point I want to make

14

is that Mr. Clement says there are commissions on sales

15

in the sales territory.

16

about is any commitment by a physician.

17

look at the transcript and he talks about sales in the

18

sales territory, he is talking about the sales by the

19

pharmacy.

That's where the sale occurs in this

20

industry.

It's to the wholesaler and to the pharmacy

21

and to the customer.

23

that I will make at bottom is that you have to have a
