MR. KROGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Pearson v. Callahan, this Court gave the

12

lower Federal courts discretionary power to decide

13

substantive questions of constitutional law in qualified

14

immunity cases in order to further the development of

15

constitutional precedent.

17

that this Court be able to review those decisions in

issues here, and I hope we do get to th substance.

Camreta is doing now?
MR. KROGER:

The record does not, Your

6

Honor, because the mootness issue was raised relatively

7

late in the proceedings, but I'm aware of what his

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. KROGER:

10

Which is?

He is a child protective

11

services worker with the Oregon Department of Human

12

Services.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

What I was about to ask is

14

this:

15

a -- a determination on the merits, it should be

16

reviewable, but could still disagree that it's

17

reviewable where the requirements for Article III are

18

not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable

19

controversy between the parties.

20
21
22

I can agree with you that -- that where there is

What -- what is the interest of the -- of
the parties who were victorious here?
MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, the interest of Mr.

23

Camreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job.

24

the Ninth Circuit's decision, he is forced to either

25

forgo a regular and recurring duty of his job, which is

1

to interview potential child victims in school, or to

2

face liability for doing so.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

Why would he face

4

liability?

Because he didn't have the opportunity to

5

challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision;

6

therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him.

7

party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative

8

holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're

9

not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an

10

opportunity to raise it on appeal.

11

be precluded?

12

you're suggesting?

13

A

So why would Camreta

Why would he face punitive damages as

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit

14

opinion does apply to Mr. Camreta.

15

specifically advised Mr. Camreta and others in his

16

position that they are on notice that in-school

17

interviews of students that require a seizure require a

18

warrant, and, thus, the Ninth Circuit decision does have

19

precedential effect and impacts Mr. Camreta.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The court

But it takes -­
General -­

It takes two to tango, and

23

a case or controversy requires somebody on the other

24

side who cares a fig about the outcome.

25

who was the -- the young woman affected in the case, has

And here, S.G.,

moved to another State and -- making it virtually

2

certain that she'll never confront this situation again.

3

She doesn't care what the result of this thing is.

4

Besides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so

5

now?

6

the same situation.

It's impossible that she will be confronted with

MR. KROGER:

7

Your Honor, I disagree that

8

S.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of

9

this case.

In footnote 20 of the Respondent's brief on

10

page 33, the Respondent notes that they have filed a

11

motion in the United States district court to bring

12

their Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County, a

13

potential party that has no qualified immunity as a

14

defense.

15

that claim against Deschutes County will depend very

16

much on the ruling on the merits of this Court.

17

And, obviously, the legal viability of that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is a Monell claim,

18

and it's -- and the district court has held its ruling,

19

I take it, in abeyance pending -- a ruling for

20

reinstatement of that claim, pending our decision here?

21

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

The district court ruled that it was premature until

23

these proceedings were concluded.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why isn't the

answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not

going to be confronted with this situation again and who

she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified

14

So, what -- what genuine controversy is before us?

15

It just seems like the whole case has

She has no claim.

MR. KROGER:

She did have a claim

Your Honor, the controversy

16

remains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the

17

Respondent is seeking to pursue in the United States

18

district court and that gives the Respondent here a

19

direct financial stake in the viability of their Fourth

20

Amendment argument, and -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Isn't

22

that -- isn't that the -- the county's claim?

How

23

Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't

24

belong to him; it belongs to the entity who is telling

25

him how to do his job.

And so why don't we go back to

investigated again.

She's in another State.

I

8

understand that she doesn't even ever want to return to

Oregon for, probably, fairly good reasons, at least from

10

her perspective.

So, again, why isn't this the

11

interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the

12

officer?
MR. KROGER:

13

Your Honor, in Arizonans v.

14

Arizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that

15

case had an interest in how she was able to conduct her

16

job.

17

because she had resigned from her position with the

18

State.

19

because she was a public employee that wanted to perform

20

her job in a particular way because she was required to

under State law, and here -­

22

The Court decided that the case was -- was moot

But there was no objection to -- to her standing

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She was the plaintiff.

23

In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff

24

still had a viable claim, right?

25

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General Kroger, I don't

2

think that the question here is really a standing

3

question; it's really whether there is a controversy

4

between this particular plaintiff and this particular

5

defendant such that a judgment in this case would

6

actually affect the legal relationship between the two,

7

between the particular plaintiff and the particular

8

defendant.
So how would it do that?

9

How would a legal

10

judgment in this case affect the legal relationship

11

between this plaintiff and this defendant?
MR. KROGER:

12

Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr.

13

Camreta remains a party below, and it's possible that

14

the Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may

15

impact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being

16

made against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in

17

controversy below.
Moreover, this case, even if one strips out

18
19

the ongoing motion that's been made in the district

20

court, resembles in all material respects Erie v.

21

Pap's A.M., where the Court found that there was

22

standing to bring the case and it was not moot.

23

there does seem to be an active case or controversy that

24

is equivalent to that that was present in Erie v.

Pap's A.M.

And what's the substance of

that?
MR. KROGER:

7

It is a claim of Mrs. Greene to

interference with familial rights as a result of certain

actions by Mr. Camreta and other defendants.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

But that didn't have to

do with the school search -- the school seizure?

12

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- and this case

14

presents the question about was this unreasonable?

15

-- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, if we were to

22

the appropriate disposition of the case would be?

MR. KROGER:

appropriate remedy would be pursuant to Munson where -­
11
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

Well, you don't really

3

want that, because the Ninth Circuit granted qualified

4

immunity.

5

They haven't rendered a judgment on the search warrant

What would be -- what would we be vacating?

MR. KROGER:

7

That is correct, Your Honor.

8

What -- what I think the appropriate remedy for the

9

Court would be would be to effectively -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. KROGER:

Vacate the opinion.

-- vacate the opinion or

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

won't it?

Won't that make you happy?
MR. KROGER:

15

That would make you happy,

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the --

16

I think the only difficulty with that as a -- as a

17

outcome of the case is it undercuts the logic of the

18

Pearson decision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

It doesn't just do

20

that.

Is -- is Mr. Camreta in any more comfortable

21

position when he knows that the Ninth -- what the Ninth

Circuit thinks on this issue and he just has to wait

MR. KROGER:

It is not, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Camreta would be

protected.

He would presumably still be entitled to

certainly could not really establish something, I would

assume.

But municipalities, if they continue to

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, I believe the -­

the child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there

15

are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse

without speaking to the only witness that's typically

available in the case, and that is the child.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so you think

19

it would be a different rule if we're talking about some

21

and you think the child might have some evidence or at

anything other than reasonableness in that case?

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A number of the questions this morning have

17

focused on the question whether a live case or

18

controversy remains because Respondent has chosen not to

19

challenge the Ninth Circuit's qualified immunity ruling

20

and so purportedly has no continuing stake in the

21

resolution of this controversy.

22

not correct for the reasons General Kroger has given,

23

but it's also not an irreducible minimum of this Court's

24

jurisdiction to correct the mistake that the Ninth

Circuit made in this case.

evasive of review?

This is not capable of repetition,

MS. KRUGER:

5

Does she have any

Well, two responses, Justice

6

Ginsburg.

First, as General Kroger mentioned, she has a

7

continuing interest in how this Court resolves this

8

controversy because of her attempt to bring the same

9

Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County.

10

setting that aside, this Court hasn't universally

11

required that as a prerequisite to exercising its

12

jurisdiction.

13

to illustrate the point.

But

I think there are two examples that help

The first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M.

14
15

case, in which this Court decided to review a State

16

court injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no

17

longer had what we would think of as an Article III

18

stake in the case by the time the case reached this

19

Court.

20

The plaintiff in that case had left the nude

21

dancing business and had affirmatively stated they had

22

no intention to return.

23

reached the merits of the State court decision that was

24

on review because to do otherwise would be to saddle the

City of Erie with an ongoing injury.

constitutional ruling?

21

For example, in any case where there's a

constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling,

about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a

the qualified immunity situation is different and how

would you be able to cabin this rule?
MS. KRUGER:

5

How would you say that

The reason we think the

6

qualified immunity situation is different, it presents a

7

set of exceptional circumstances that weren't an

8

exception to the usual prudential rule, is because the

9

qualified immunity situation is one in which this Court

10

has encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of

11

constitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the

12

legal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of

13

establishing the law so that the -- that qualified

immunity doesn't remain perpetually available to

every case in which a court does these paired rulings,

purpose to clarify the law.

MS. KRUGER:

I think that in this situation

appeals would decide the case subsequently in a case in

which it was actually necessary to reach a certain

judgment.

legal landscape going forward.

7

such that qualified immunity will not be available in

the next case.

9

Camreta and other child protective services workers who

10

are doing their best to protect children from abuse are

11

now on notice that if they attempt to detain temporarily

12

a child in school for the purposes of trying to confirm

13

or dispel a reasonable suspicion of child abuse without

a warrant supported by probable cause, that they will

invite lawsuits that would put them on the line for

That's true, Justice Scalia,

and I think that if that's the disposition that this

Court thinks is appropriate, we would be certainly be

happier with that than a rule that says -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

It would be -­

MS. KRUGER:

-- an incorrect constitutional

ruling.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

It would be a

4

partial vacatur, right?

5

hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under

6

Munsingwear?
MS. KRUGER:

7

The Court's done that before,

That's correct, Mr. Chief

8

Justice.

But I would note that a vacatur rule would

9

come with certain costs that I think this Court should

10

keep in mind as it decides what the appropriate

11

disposition of this case is.

12

The reason that Respondent has so vigorously

13

objected to that disposition is because it is

14

inconsistent in some ways with the very reason for

15

permitting courts of appeals to undertake this kind of

16

constitutional determination in the first place.

17

undermines the -- the development of the constitutional

18

law if this Court simply wipes the -- the slate clean

19

but doesn't exercise its own authority to clarify the

20

law by correcting what the Ninth Circuit has done.

21

I think, as the Chief Justice has quite correctly

22

pointed out, it also does nothing to dispel the cloud of

23

uncertainty that hangs over individuals within the

24

territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If it's vacated, it

4

indicates that there's no established law on that

5

question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do

6

what he considered appropriate under the circumstances,

7

and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on

8

him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might

9

have before.

10

MS. KRUGER:

I think that's correct, Mr.

11

Chief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not

12

object to that disposition in this case.

13

observe that that disposition is one that does not sit

14

particularly comfortably with the reasoning of Pearson

15

and the line of cases that comes before it, that

16

recognizes that the reason why we encourage courts of

17

appeals to undertake these determinations in the first

18

place is to promote the development of constitutional

19

law and to ensure that the law doesn't remain not

clearly established in perpetuity.

Would this be clearly

interpretation of that?

MS. KRUGER:

I think it's -- it's true that

14

if this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's

15

constitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are

16

similarly situated wouldn't face the very significant

17

concrete prospective effect of this decision, which is

18

to strip them of qualified immunity in future cases.

the law is not clearly established.

unconstitutional unless the questioning officials have a

they have a warrant or court order or parental consent

11

or exigent circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:

12

What is there in the Ninth

13

Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a

warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation

15

was relevant to their decision?

child protective services need to decide whether they

need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no

MS. KUBITSCHEK:

I'm aware of that.

But,

was conceded that there was a seizure so early in the -­

in the case that the normal development of facts which,

question the child to find whether or not there was

abuse, or would you set it at some lower level?
MS. KUBITSCHEK:

Well, in fact, Your Honor,

3

the -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking

4

court approval, and their -- they differ in whether they

5

require probable cause or reasonable suspicion or

6

something like reasonable cause; and so while we put in

7

our brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been

8

based upon probable cause, given the law enforcement

9

component, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy

10

sheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a

11

child welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker

12

were going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some

13

kind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of

14

the States differ between reasonable suspicion and

15

probable cause, I would suggest that the better course

would be to let this play itself out between those two

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the standard?

I

procedure could be used with every child in every school

9

without some ground for suspicion, correct?

10

MR. KROGER:

No, Your Honor, we believe that

11

reasonable suspicion is the -- is the proper basis

12

before making a seizure of a child to conduct one of

13

these inquiries.

14

Significant here in Griffin and subsequent

15

cases like Lidster, the Court has recognized that the

16

relationship between the State and the person being

17

searched or seized is significant to the reasonableness

18

analysis, and here it is not an adversarial

19

relationship.

significant interest in making sure that that child is

21

safe; and were the government to continue to be put in a

22

position of not being able to speak to a child until

23

probable cause has developed in some other way, children

24

will continue to be placed at risk.

The child and the State share a

status quo ante, and you tell all your people that they

can do what they would have done beforehand; is that

right?

That is correct, Your Honor.

That would be a -- a significant step forward for Mr.

9

Camreta and others similarly placed.

The -- the

challenge is that those kind of claims then would be

12

the law would not be clarified.

And that -­
Would you -- are you -­

and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex

ante.

16

they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct?

17

And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't,

18

right?

At any moment that an agency speaks to a child,

19

MR. KROGER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And law enforcement is

21

never going to know where that line of reasonableness or

22

unreasonableness is, is that correct?

23

MR. KROGER:

MR. KROGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's part

2

of the reason we agreed that a seizure was committed

3

here, so that law enforcement are not placed in a

4

difficult position every time they speak to a child, of

5

trying to make their own determination as to whether -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they do it anyway,

7

meaning even if we say that they can seize the child,

8

you would still have to not do a seizure that was

unreasonable.

10

You wouldn't -- in scope.

They can't

speak to the child endlessly, can they?
MR. KROGER:

No, Your Honor, that's correct.

Honor, than the threshold question of if they start to

talk to a child, of trying to judge in the middle of an

interview, have we gone too far, has a seizure occurred.

That's different, I think, though, Your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not quite sure why

you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was

your strategic choice.

Mr. Chief Justice, the question

is whether vacating the decision will have an impact on
