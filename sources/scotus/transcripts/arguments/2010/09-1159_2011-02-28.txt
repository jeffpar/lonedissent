ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. AYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Bayh-Dole Act sets forth a comprehensive

12

disposition of rights in inventions made by nonprofit

13

organizations and small business organizations under

14

Federal funding agreements.

15

specifically defines the rights of inventors and it puts

16

them in the third position behind the contractor, the

17

nonprofit contractor, and behind the government, and

18

specifically says that the inventor may only receive

19

rights -- that is to say, take title -- when the -- when

20

the contractor has declined to take title or defaulted

21

in some respect, and the government itself has -- has

22

likewise declined to take title.

23

That disposition

In this case Roche's sole claim rests on an

24

assignment from an inventor who was at that time I think

25

without question a Stanford employee who was working on
3

a project under a Federal funding agreement.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What if the inventor had

not been an employee?

5

university, how does this automatic vesting -­

MR. AYER:

If it had been an independent

8

regulations at least do.

that the contractor in that instance, if in fact working

10

on a Federally funded project, would step into the shoes

11

of the contractor.

12

the outcome in terms of whether it would be a Bayh-Dole

13

invention.

14

And they indicate that the -­

But I don't believe it would affect

The -- the critical fact here is that the

15

inventor was working on a project that was already

16

funded, his work at Cetus was part of that project.

17

then that result was -­

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

That seems to be a

19

factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that.

20

According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this

21

scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal

22

funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the

23

Stanford project, came about after the scientist had

24

spent his 9 months at Cetus.

25

picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that

At least that's the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they got their assignment from the scientist at a time

2

when there was no Federally funded project.

3

MR. AYER:

That's what they say, Your Honor,

4

and I would submit that is plainly not correct.

We deal

5

with this at pages 21 and 22 of our yellow brief, and we

6

specifically talk about the fact -- there's several

7

critical facts here.

8

written about the work at Cetus, the JID article at page

9

135 of the joint appendix, specifically has a footnote

One is that the article which was

10

indicating that the work reported on -- that is the work

11

at Cetus on the assay -- was funded by the two specific

12

grants in issue.

13

Dr. Merigan, who is the head of the lab at

14

Stanford that Dr. Holodniy worked in, talks in his

15

declaration at 98 and 99 of the joint appendix -­

16

specifically talks about how Dr. Holodniy's work was

17

part of the AIDS research center at Stanford and part of

18

an AIDS clinical trial at Stanford, and all of that work

19

was federally funded.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Just -- just as a

21

hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice

22

Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual

23

even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much

24

less employed by a Stanford project funded by the

25

Federal Government, entered into this kind of an
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agreement with somebody that he had been working for.

2

How -- how would it -­

3

MR. AYER:

Well, I think you have to look

4

very carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak

5

loosely and categorically about the facts, but what -­

6

what I will say is that in a situation where -- and this

7

is very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work

8

is done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set

9

of facts, not affiliated with the university, and

10

they -- let's say that person conceives of an invention,

11

and that later the university takes that conception of

12

an invention and reduces it to practice.

13

by a person who is not a university employee, if -- if

14

there's no university person involved in the conception,

15

then it can't be an invention of the contractor, because

16

you can't be an inventor without being part of the

17

conception.

18

The conception

So that's a variation on Your Honor's -- on

19

Your Honor's question, but it's a -- it's a clear

20

example where Bayh-Dole would not apply.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How does that change when

22

you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was

23

already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as

24

an employee of Stanford when he was at this other

25

company?

You could still say that -- that Stanford was
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not the inventor.

2

MR. AYER:

Well, you would -- you -- I think

3

you are now in a zone where one of the things that has

4

to be considered is the equitable character of any

5

assignment of a future interest, that is to say a future

6

invention.

7

here, the possibility that there might at some future

8

time be an invention, then equitable considerations come

9

into play; and one of the equitable considerations we

Because if in fact what was assigned was, as

10

think the one that is of paramount significance, is the

11

fact that the Congress of the United States has said in

12

the context of Bayh-Dole that when the United States

13

invests money in research, it wants certain things to

14

happen that are very carefully set out in the -- in the

15

Bayh-Dole Act.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you tell me, assume

17

no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties

18

that are not involved with the Federal Government.

19

Inventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor -­

20

inventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent -­

21

MR. AYER:

Well, it depends what's assigned,

22

Your Honor.

If -- if B is a bona fide to purchaser

23

under 35 U.S.C. 261, then B would prevail.

24

a bona fide purchaser, and that can only apply under

25

261, where you are dealing with an assignment in law of
7
Alderson Reporting Company

If B is not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a patent or a patent application, then I think you are

2

in the difficult zone where there are two competing

3

interests in the future possibility of an invention; and

4

I don't know that I can, without knowing all the facts,

5

even intelligently try to tell you what would end up

6

happening.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this case, if you do

8

not prevail on your principal argument, have you

9

preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was

10

contrary to public policy?

11

MR. AYER:

I think we have, Your Honor.

12

think -- essentially I would say, frankly that that

13

is -­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

didn't seem to discuss that.

16

MR. AYER:

I

But the court of appeals

Well, I think that is at the

17

heart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the

18

government's argument, and it is that, as the trial

19

court here held, and as we've said in our brief several

20

times, the inventor, because he is working here at the

21

time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as

22

an employee of Stanford University, is essentially

23

working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being

24

covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to

25

transfer title to this future invention to someone else
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because the statute has already spoken for it.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Ayer, it seems the

3

Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the

4

scientist saying "I will assign," which was the language

5

used in the agreement with Stanford, and "I hereby do

6

assign," and it seems that that was critical to the -­

7

to the Federal Circuit's decision.

8
9

They say -- they cite a whole bunch of
cases.

The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had

10

said "I hereby do assign," there would be no case

11

because Stanford would have been first in time.

12

MR. AYER:

Well, one interesting thing about

13

that discussion is that the very first case that we know

14

anything about, that we're aware of, making that

15

distinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an

16

assignment using the words "I hereby assign," was the

17

FilmTec case in 1991.

18

in this case, so how was Stanford supposed to know that

19

that fine distinction was going to be made?

20

That was 2 years after the events

We think the critical -- the critical issue

21

here is whether the inventor, while working on a

22

federally funded project as an employee of the

23

contractor -- and there's no doubt that his work at

24

Cetus was part of his Stanford research.

25

to do is look at pages 16a to 18a of the petition
9
Alderson Reporting Company

All you have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appendix for the court of appeals decision or pages 62a

2

and 69a for the district court opinion.

3

clear that everyone knew he came to Cetus to advance his

4

work on his Stanford research, which was in fact funded,

5

as we show at pages 21 and 22.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's perfectly

And the Bayh-Dole -­

What have universities been

7

doing for the last 30 years?

8

on the assumption that title to inventions vested in

9

them automatically or have they been very careful about

10
11

Have they been proceeding

getting assignments from all of their employees?
MR. AYER:

Universities, and -- and I think

12

everybody engaged in research, is generally careful.

13

They have policies in place to get assignments, and

14

there are lots of reasons why that would be true.

15

was true before the Bayh-Dole Act.

16

wise and prudent practice to have an understanding with

17

your employees about who is going to own what.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's a -- it's a

Do those policies ever

19

distinguish between Federally funded projects and

20

Non-Federally funded projects?

21

MR. AYER:

It

I don't -- I don't know about the

22

universe of them.

I -- I know that the -- that the

23

Stanford policy in this case relevant at this time was a

24

policy that indicated employees could retain title in

25

many instances, but not where Federal law, applicable
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

law, says that they can't retain title; and in that

2

sense they do.

3

But those policies I think are very

4

clearly in virtually every case I know anything about

5

policies that are signed by an employee pretty much the

6

day they walk in the door, as I think was the case here

7

with Dr. Holodniy back in 1988.

8

understanding of what the expectations are, and I don't

9

want to here be heard to say at all that we think this

And it's a general

10

is an unwise thing or that it isn't a good thing that it

11

goes on.

12

because people need to understand what the situation is.

It's a very good thing that it goes on,

13

The critical issue is whether, in the event

14

that that fails to happen for some reason or that there

15

is a slip-up here where a fellow going to visit

16

somewhere on the first day there has something put under

17

his nose called a visitor's confidentiality agreement

18

which he happens to sign, and down in paragraph 2 it

19

talks about assigning away everything that he ever might

20

do as a consequence of this.

21

The point is that in that situation you

22

can't have the interest of the United States, which is

23

the critical paramount interest in this case -- I want

24

to make that very clear.

25

United States when it spends millions and billions of

It's the interest in the

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you ever have

13

different arrangements with respect to the assignments

depending upon who the researcher is?

MR. AYER:

And if -- it

The statute -- the statute

11

defines a universe of covered cases which are inventions

12

of the contractor, which we think the other side uses

those words to argue that -- that inventions of the

15

already owns by virtue of -­

16
17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Plus the word "retained,"

don't forget that, too.
MR. AYER:

Right.

Those two provisions are

19

essentially their argument for narrowing the universe of

20

inventions that is covered.

21

And I want to just say at the outset, the

22

critical thing about narrowing the universe of

23

inventions covered is that it narrows the universe of

24

inventions in which the government's rights to, number

25

one, itself receive title under several provisions of
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the act; number two, itself to enforce a whole series of

2

requirements under 202(c)(4), (5), (6), (7) and a

3

variety of other provisions, to itself march in and do

4

things.

5

When you define out of that category

6

instances where inventions exist and were produced with

7

Federal money, then you're limiting the coverage of the

8

government's interests.

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are two things that

cut very strongly against your argument.

I mean, there

17

are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two

18

things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against

19

your argument are:

20

rule that inventors have title to their patents

21

initially, even if they make those inventions while

22

working for somebody else.

First, that it has long been the

And the second is that you are relying on a

24

provision that says that the nonprofit organization may

elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title,

Alderson Reporting Company

corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to

There's just

"Retain" does not mean obtain.
MR. AYER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Can I

Basically, what I would say is, on the first

7

point:

8

general rule, that inventors receive title.

9

just in this case, in this fact pattern, the array of

You're quite correct, obviously, that that's the
However,

10

so-called vesting statutes that predated the Bayh-Dole

11

Act throughout the 30 years in between are statutes that

12

specifically, in most instances without any discussion

13

of an assignment, simply vested title directly in the

14

United States.

15

that, and they did it, and no one ever seriously argued

16

that they couldn't.

17

So Congress clearly had the power to do

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this isn't vesting it

18

This is -- this is speaking of

19

the -- the university retaining title.

20

government was going to make such a huge change from

21

normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention

22

until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set

23

forth clearly?

If -- if the

All they needed was one paragraph.

24

MR. AYER:

Well, Your Honor -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It says when you're working

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no

2

right to your invention as an -- as an employee.

It

3

automatically vests in the -- in the university.

I

4

would have expected that to be set forth very clearly

5

if -- if they were making such an immense change in

6

patent law.

7

MR. AYER:

Well, Your Honor, I would take

8

exception to how immense it is, given the prior history

9

in which the government simply took title to these very

10

same inventions.

11

But on the issue of the meaning of the word

12

"retain," that's actually a word that has a lot of

13

potential connotations.

14

here without any doubt is that it doesn't mean that you

15

had to have ownership before, because in section 202(d)

16

of the act, the act specifically talks about the

17

inventor's opportunity to itself be considered for

18

retention of title, and everyone agrees that that phrase

19

is one that never applies when the inventor already has

20

title.

So "retain" doesn't mean that.

12

On 38 of the red brief, you will see the

13

other side vehemently arguing that that only applies

14

when the inventor doesn't have title to start with.

you can't have "retain" mean one thing in one place and

As the Chief Justice's question suggests,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, could I ask you

just a factual question?
When the Federal Government contracts with

universities or other nonprofits, does it require those

universities to get assignments from their employees?

12

And if so, how?

13

MR. STEWART:

The government-wide regulation

14

that -- which was promulgated by the Department of

15

Commerce and which identifies certain things that should

16

be in the funding agreements, it does not require an

17

assignment of title from the university's employees.

18

The regulation does require the university

19

to make assurance -- give assurances that it has

20

contractual obligations from its employees to cooperate

21

in filing the documents necessary to process a completed

22

patent application.

23

And second, under Respondent's theory I think

That is, Respondent's vision of the

10

Congress left entirely to private ordering, was

11

indifferent as to whether the contractor took title in

12

the first instance.

13

And if that view of the statute were

14

accepted, there would at least be a substantial doubt

15

whether the Commerce Department could promulgate

16

regulations that would validly require the contractor to

17

do something that, in Respondent's view, Congress left

18

to private ordering.

19

Now, I don't want to argue that point too

20

vigorously, because certainly, if this Court holds that

21

assignments from the inventors are required, we would

22

like to have the opportunity to require the contractor

23

to get them, but it isn't clear to me how you would get

there if Respondent's view of the statute were accepted.

12

to retain title, and that's clear in a couple of

different respects.

14

reading, section 202(d), says that if the contractor

does not elect to retain title, then the inventor can

make a request for retention of title, which the agency

will consider after consultation with the contractor.

I think there are probably a

as one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very

natural to distinguish between a present assignment and

to distinguish between a present assignment of an

I think

one of the concerns that the government has, and this

3

was hinted at by the Chief Justice's question, is that

4

we're -- we're worried not just about what can be done

5

to universities, but what universities could do to us.

6

That is, it's standard university practice to say

7

employees agree to assign their inventions to the

8

university, and the two parties will divide the

9

royalties; and if that is done, then even under

MR. STEWART:

-- well, the -- the NIH

document is internally inconsistent, because it says at

5

the beginning that title passes automatically to the

university, but then, as you say, it states later on

that an assignment is required, but that the contractor

is required to get it.

And I think some people have proceeded on

that assumption because it never -- so long as

13

But to continue my answer to Justice Kagan,

14

I wanted to point out, under Respondent's theory,

15

universities could make a conscious, calculated decision

16

that, rather than obtain an assignment for their

17

inventors, they would simply agree with the inventor

18

that royalties would be split in -- in the same manner

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5
6

MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

The Bayh-Dole Act had the laudable objective

8

of taking inventions off of government shelves and

9

putting them into the market, and it succeeded; but it

10

did not change the long-standing rule dating back to

11

this Court's decisions in Hapgood and Dubilier that

12

title to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to

13

assignment, not in the inventor's employer.

14

that, in light of this long-settled rule which Congress

15

nowhere purported to change, the Act should be given its

16

straightforward meaning.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We submit

Is there a reason

18

that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on

19

we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody

else until they have an agreement making clear that the

inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with

22

the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act?

23

MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, I know of

24

no reason why the Federal Government cannot make that

25

requirement.

In fact, in the case of FilmTec v.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Hydranautics, a Federal Circuit decision, the decision

2

reflects that the Federal agency there did exactly that.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you have no

4

problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his

5

client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the

6

government could impose that, even though there's

7

nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though

8

somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat

9

inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it

10

wants to promote commercialization.

12

never been litigated, but I know of no reason why a

13

Federal agency couldn't say to a contractor, we want to

be absolutely certain that the assumption that underlay

all the way back to Attorney General Biddle's report in

Official - Subject to Final Review

and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the

2

line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to

3

pursue it.

4

They say the strongest analogy is with

5

government employees, and if you look at government

6

employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid

7

for it, they should have the invention.

8

they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have

9

the invention, but they insist upon an assignment,

10

And the way

assignment of an exclusive license.

11

And there are cases which are cited here

12

that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his

13

way around that and simply goes and before the

14

government can get it assigns the interest to a third

15

party, that that third party assignment is void as a

16

matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the

17

government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter

18

of law, a legal implication from the executive order in

19

the circumstance.

20

That brings me back to where Justice

21

Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy.

Stanford got subsequently from all three coinventors and

MR. FLEMING:

Well, in most situations there

14

will be a valid assignment, but the fact that Stanford

Your theory -- your theory is that whatever

nothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal

to make sure that the contractor doesn't get the

doing something with it.

Chief Justice, there would be other doctrines that the

14

invoke, including section 261 of the Patent Act or a

that could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point -­

be easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by

22

the inventor and the contractor working together.

23

MR. FLEMING:

It's not that it can be

24

circumvented.

It's -- there are efforts, there are ways

25

in which if there is an inequitable assignment, it can

be attacked in equity.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's nothing

inequitable about it.

4

between the university and the inventor.

5

It's a perfectly fair deal

Mr. Fleming:

In that event the government

6

has all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about.

7

As a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by

8

eminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low

if in fact it has funded all of the research.

21

problem off the table?

22

MR. FLEMING:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, clearly

24

Congress was thinking about how to protect the

25

government's interests with respect to these patents,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and to say, well, we have these interests with respect

2

to patents that the university owns, but we don't have

3

those same interests with respect to patents that the

4

individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre.

5

MR. FLEMING:

There is an explanation,

6

Justice Kagan.

Which is that the universities had shown

7

they didn't need a vesting rule in order to get title

8

from their inventors, just the same as private industry

9

does not need a vesting rule to get title to

10

nonfederally funded inventions.

11

Attorney General Biddle in 1947 -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This was something that

Sorry.

They -- they do.

13

I mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the

14

patent.

15

MR. FLEMING:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct, Justice Sotomayor.
And there -- there is

17

proof that they can go into court, an employer can go

18

into court and show that the inventor was hired for this

19

specific item and the law would presume or recognize the

20

employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of

21

that up to the nature of the contract that the

22

university entered into with its inventors?

23

MR. FLEMING:

That's precisely what happens

24

in the context of Federal employees, it's governed by

25

the employment relationship between the Federal
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Government and the employee, and it was shown in the IPA

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the -- but the

6

question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up

7

on, why would Congress create this act relying on

Nothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere

is there a requirement that Federal contractors seek

such a requirement.

14

able to do it without the vesting rule.

15

The universities and industry were

I think in order for Stanford to prevail

16

here, to Justice Scalia's point, the Court would have to

17

be satisfied that -- that Congress worked a highly

18

transformative change in the law of patent ownership and

19

assignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect

20

way.

21

it does in section 201 of the Copyright Act, which

22

expressly says that an employer can be treated like an

23

author for purposes of the copyright.

24

in the way that was done under the IPAs, which is it was

25

left entirely up to private contract.

It didn't do it through an express provision, like

45
Alderson Reporting Company

It didn't do it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Supposedly it created this brand-new vesting

2

rule, not through a clear provision, but through a

3

questionable implications from the preamble or other

4

provisions of the Act that don't directly apply, and it

5

did it without a peep in the legislative history that

6

Congress was trying to do this.

7

that for 30 years of Bayh-Dole, no one noticed this

8

supposedly all-encompassing vesting rule until this case

9

arose.

I think it's remarkable

As Justice Alito -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it's also remarkable

11

the other way, that here we have many statutes that took

12

the principle that when the government pays for an

invention, the invention vests in the government.

decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right

important to make a distinction between statutes that

for an assignment from the employee or the contractor,

But

10

the core of this invention.

13

read pages 55 to 57 of the Joint Appendix, where he has

happened is that Dr. Holodniy's supervisor at Stanford,

18

there, he signed a separate assignment, the one that

2

assigned his inventions, as a result of the

3

collaboration or as a consequence of the collaboration,

to Cetus.

And that was the consideration.
To this day, Stanford has not explained what

6

Cetus could have done to protect its intellectual

property so that it could have been able to practice its

invention without having to go to Stanford for a license

9

and pay a royalty.

As far as I know, the only thing

under Stanford's theory that Cetus could have done is

told Dr. Holodniy to take a hike, because they couldn't

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. AYER:

We talked earlier about the word "retain."

18

The word "retain" cannot, consistent with its usage in

19

202(d), mean that whoever is retaining it must have

20

owned it before they started, because it's a hundred

21

percent clear, just from thinking about the statute and

22

from reading page 38 of the red brief, that when an

23

inventor is allowed to be considered for retention of

24

title, he never has ownership of it.

"retain" can't mean that.
