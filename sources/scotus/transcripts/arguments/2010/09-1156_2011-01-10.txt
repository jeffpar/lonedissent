CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

v. James Siracusano.

Mr. Hacker.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HACKER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

All drug companies receive, on an almost

12

daily basis, anecdotal hearsay reports about alleged

13

adverse health events following the use of their

14

products.

15

establish any reliable facts about the drug's

16

performance or its safety, especially where, as here,

17

there are only a handful of reports out of millions of

18

products sold over a 4-year period, and -­

Those incident reports do not themselves

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

Mr. Hacker, do we know

20

that from this record?

I mean, we know that the

21

plaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute

22

whether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there

23

were no other complaints made?

24

there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading

25

stage.

So that, let's say,

The company would have said:
3
Alderson Reporting Company

That's it; we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't have any more.
MR. HACKER:

2

All I can speak for is what's

3

alleged in the complaint, and the complaint, no matter

4

how read, doesn't allege any more than 23 adverse event

5

reports.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

But they might have been

7

able through discovery to find that there were many

8

more.

9

MR. HACKER:

That's true, but there's no

10

allegation that what they -- what they know about or

11

what they could find would have been a statistically

12

significant difference between the rate of reported

13

events and the background of -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why shouldn't that

15

determination be deferred until there's discovery, and

16

then we can know how many reports there really were?

17

MR. HACKER:

Because it's incumbent on a

18

plaintiff to come to court with a case, to plead the

19

facts necessary to establish all of the elements of a

20

claim, and a securities fraud claim, of course, requires

21

both materiality and scienter.

22

established unless the company has knowledge of facts

23

establishing a reliable basis for inferring that the

24

drug itself is the cause of the reported event.

25

And neither of those is

Absent information like that, there is
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

neither materiality nor scienter under the securities

2

laws, because neither the company nor an investor -­

3

until there's reliable evidence of a causal link between

4

the two products, neither a company -- excuse me, a link

5

between the product and the event -- neither the company

6

nor an investor would have any reason to think that an

7

adverse event report is -- actually indicates a problem

8

with the product -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

9
10

MR. HACKER:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can there be -­

-- as opposed to a coincidence.
Can there be some situations

12

in which statistically significant evidence would not be

13

necessary?
For example, suppose some very distinguished

14
15

physicians concluded, based on clinical trials, that

16

there was a connection between a drug and a very serious

17

side effect.

18

Could that establish materiality?
MR. HACKER:

Well, I think a distinguished

19

physician would not conclude that there's a connection

20

unless the clinical trials reveal a statistically

21

significant difference between what they've seen and

22

what they would expect to see were there no association.

23

So there's that point, Your Honor.

24
25

But the second point I would make is we
acknowledge there are a very narrow, limited number of
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances under which a claim can be pled absent

2

statistically significant evidence, but that's -- that's

3

because doctors and researchers will conclude that there

4

may be causation under narrow circumstances.

5

example, I think the most common set of criteria are the

6

Bradford-Hill criteria.

7

here, Your Honor.

8
9

For

But nothing like that is pled

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Hacker, the complaint

did not rely exclusively upon these adverse incidents

10

but also referred to a -- a study, a report by

11

researchers at the American Rhinologic Society -­

12

MR. HACKER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Yes.
-- which -- which asserted

that there was a connection.

15

MR. HACKER:

But that -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the -- is the question

17

before us simply whether in isolation the adverse

18

incidents would be enough, or is not the question

19

whether those adverse incidents placed next to this

20

study would be enough?

21

MR. HACKER:

Well, two points, Your Honor.

22

First, the plaintiffs have, throughout this litigation,

23

framed their case as one based on the failure to

24

disclose adverse event reports.

25

adverse event reports that they say is the problem, and

It's the number of

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they're not saying that there was a study out there and

2

that we failed to disclose the study.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. HACKER:

They say -­

Why didn't they say that?

-- it's the fact of the adverse

5

event reports.

6

to be clear, the study is not attached to the complaint,

7

so there wasn't a basis in the complaint for saying the

8

company was aware of a reliable study, and here are the

9

details of the study, and they failed to disclose it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Well, I think if you look at the -- now,

Well, I thought the -­

you're saying the complaint did not refer to the study?
MR. HACKER:

12

It did refer to it.

That's

13

true.

14

nothing there.

15

study of one -- and, again, this isn't in the complaint;

16

it's in the -- it is attached to the red brief, Your

17

Honor.

18

And if you look at the study, there's really
It's based on -- primarily on a case

There's one case study of one man who is 55

19

year old -- 55 years old, which is the population most

20

likely to experience anosmia.

21

it when you're -- he's suffering from signs of lupus,

22

which causes anosmia, and he's taking Flonase, which

23

also causes anosmia.

24

from that one incident out of millions over years of

25

product sales that -- that Zicam causes anosmia and that

You're more likely to get

And so the idea that you can infer

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there's a problem out there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

You're talking about

3

-- you're talking about who's right or wrong about the

4

connection between Matrixx and anosmia.

5

the question.

6

whether my stock price is going to go down.

7

have some psychic come out and say Zicam is going to

8

cause a disease, with no support whatsoever, but if it

9

causes the stock to go down 20 percent, it seems to me

10

But that's not

I'm an investor in Matrixx; I worry
You can

that's material.
MR. HACKER:

11

But if -- that's precisely the

12

point, Your Honor.

If a psychic came out or a lunatic

13

on the street corner is barking, you know, through a

14

megaphone that there's a problem with the product,

15

that's not the kind of information a -- a reasonable

16

investor would rely on.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

But wait a minute.

18

These -- these weren't psychics.

19

clinical doctors in this area, one of them you knew

20

poised to go to a society meeting to make this

21

allegation.

22

These were three

Doesn't it make a difference who the reports

23

are coming from and what the substance of those reports

24

may do to your product?

25

MR. HACKER:

It may make a difference, Your
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor, and I didn't mean to suggest that, you know,

2

these are psychics.

3

on the Chief Justice's question, that it does matter

4

what the basis of the allegation, and is the evidence,

5

the facts available to the company, reliable?

6

create a reliable inference that a reasonable investor

7

would be concerned about?

8
9

The point simply is, following up

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does it

Well, suppose -- suppose

you stipulate, in response to the Chief Justice's

10

question, that it's irrational, that it's probably

11

baseless, but that the market will react adversely.

12

there a duty then to address the claim?

Is

13

MR. HACKER:

14

clear that that's true.

15

case specifically, Your Honor, when the market reacted,

16

what the market was reacting to was a Good Morning

17

America report.

18

what that report said.

19

Under the case law, it's not
In this case, looking at this

It's very important to be clear about

On Good Morning America, a leading morning

20

news program, the allegation was made by Dr. Jafek that

21

Zicam causes anosmia.

22

allegation that what the company was -- than what it was

23

the company was aware of, which was simply the adverse

24

event reports.

25

That's a very different

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But had there -­
But if there's a baseless

3

report -- and we stipulate that, although it's baseless,

4

it's going to affect the market -- could that be the

5

basis for an allegation, assuming the requisite

6

scienter, that there's liability?
MR. HACKER:

7

Two answers, I would say, Your

8

Honor.

First of all, we have to be very careful about

9

creating a rule through our interpretation of

10

materiality that would require companies in advance to

11

disclose the fact that a baseless, false allegation

12

about the company is going to come out because it

13

requires the company to ring the bell -­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

allegation.

16

affected.

17

But it's not the

It's the fact that the market may be

MR. HACKER:

Well, I understand, but the

18

problem is if the-- what the rule would say is, because

19

the company is aware the market may be affected, the

20

company in advance has to say:

21

is about to come out.

22

ring the bell and then un-ring it in the same statement,

23

and that's not a good rule for companies.

their best to explain why the allegation is untrue.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hacker -­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -­

Mr. Hacker, you just

5

said, if I understood you correctly, that when the -­

6

when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate

7

or not, there was an obligation to do something about

8

it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that

9

there was these reports, but it's the way the company

10

responded to them:

two press releases that said

11

allegations of any linkage of the drug to anosmia are

12

completely unfounded.

13

after the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek?

That statement was made even

14

MR. HACKER:

Right.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- had this presentation,

16

and he was going to put Zicam's name on it, and the

17

company said you don't have any permission to do that.

18

So the company prevented Good Morning America from

19

happening earlier, and it made these affirmative

20

statements that there's no linkage.

21

MR. HACKER:

Well, what they said was -- and

22

this was true -- that it was completely unfounded and

23

misleading.

24

themselves rely on, which convened and issued its report

25

2 weeks later, confirmed that.

The very scientific panel that plaintiffs

There was no -- it's

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

absolutely unfounded at the time to -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

I thought that the

3

scientific report that came out later said we can't say

4

one way or the other, as opposed to the company saying

5

that any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded.
MR. HACKER:

6

And that's correct, there

7

isn't, when -- when the scientific panel said you can't

8

make that claim, it's unfounded, there's no basis in the

9

available science.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

"unfounded."

12

say yes and we can't say no.

13

completely unfounded.

They didn't say

They said the evidence is not -- we can't
That's different from

14

MR. HACKER:

15

Honor, I'm not entirely sure it is.

16

about science, you make a claim that's either supported

17

in the science or it's without support.

18

the scientific panel was making is there was no support

19

in the available science, and what Jafek was relying on

20

was unreliable.

21

Well, I'm -- with respect, Your
When you're talking

And the point

As I just described, the one -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Hacker, you're

22

saying that the question of whether there is support is

23

reducible to the question of whether there are

24

statistically significant findings.

25

understand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, as I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

drugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the

2

market, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis

3

of findings that are not statistically significant.

4

Now, clearly in those cases the market has a right to

5

know the very things that are going to make the FDA take

6

action against a product and that are going to severely

7

affect the product's value to the company.

8

statistical significance there.

9

MR. HACKER:

Not

That's true, but the problem

10

with that sort of standard -- well, first of all, to

11

emphasize -- to look at the facts of this case, the FDA

12

didn't take any action until 5 years later, but -- and

13

which shows that the -­

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it could, and

eventually it did.

16

MR. HACKER:

But that's what -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you are suggesting a

18

test for what -- what counts as material, which is

19

statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself

20

doesn't use when it thinks about what it should -- what

21

it should regulate.

22

MR. HACKER:

The problem is ex ante.

You

23

have to -- you can't look at this through hindsight.

24

You have to look at this ex ante.

25

handful of reports -- it's absolutely true, nobody would
13
Alderson Reporting Company

When a company has a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dispute, that some day in the distant future, with the

2

accumulation of more data, the FDA may take action based

3

on its own prophylactic public health regulatory

4

discretion.

5

it gets an adverse event report, can possibly know

6

whether that's enough information for the FDA to act.

7

So the prospect that the FDA may some day act on the

8

basis of additionally accumulated information would

9

require disclosure of all reports all the time, and

10

But at the time, ex ante, no company, when

that, we submit, cannot be the standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Mr. Hacker, suppose Good

12

Morning America made the same claim, categorically

13

saying that this drug caused this condition, but did so

14

simply on the basis of these adverse incidents, and they

15

didn't have Dr. Janner's, or whatever his name is,

16

reports, but nonetheless Good Morning America comes out,

17

and on the basis of those incidents, saying Zicam causes

18

whatever the condition is.

19

reported?

20

MR. HACKER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. HACKER:

Would that have to be

Well -­
And if not, why not?

I think what you would have to

23

be hypothesizing is evidence that the company, say a

24

week in advance, knew that Good Morning America was

25

going to come out and say that, because once Good
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Morning America says it, it's said it and the effect is

2

what it is.
But even in the hypothetical -- you're -­

3
4

you'd have to sort of unpack what you said.

If Good

5

Morning America came out and said just what Matrixx knew

6

at the time -- there are a handful of adverse event

7

reports, there's -- it's over millions of product uses

8

over a 4-year period, and no indication that that's at

9

all in any way different from the incident rate in the

10

general population, especially among cold users, who, of

11

course, are most likely to experience anosmia -- you

12

know, we don't know what would have happened.

13

you add the element that Good Morning America then

14

declares that Zicam causes anosmia -- again, the

15

hypothetical would have to be in advance Matrixx is

16

aware -­

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. HACKER:

19

All right.

But then

That's -­

-- that the false claim is

going to be made.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. HACKER:

Fine.

Right, and I would say, first

22

of all, we have to be very careful, as I said before,

23

about a rule that requires a company to disclose false

24

facts.

25

doesn't want false information; a reasonable investor

I would say, second, that a reasonable investor

wants accurate information.

would actually -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. HACKER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

And that -­
-- even though it isn't

true.
MR. HACKER:

9

And that's a third point I

10

would make, Your Honor, is it's a different case, a

11

fundamentally different case -­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. HACKER:

14

No -­

-- if you're talking about a

no.

rely upon it.

19
20

There's no basis for its being said on Good Morning

MR. HACKER:

and I think that the reason it's no -­

It responds to a reasonable investor who wants

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

A reasonable

investor is going to worry about the fact that thousands

6

of unreasonable investors are going to dump their

Matrixx stock.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. HACKER:

10

I -- I absolutely -- I

understand that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

So -- but, I mean,

12

there's nothing unreasonable about that.

13

if you're looking at Good Morning America, you say, my

14

gosh, everybody else is going to sell this; I'm going to

15

sell, too.

16

should have told me about it before.

17

If it looks -­

And if it turns out you knew about it, you

18

first of all, a company ex ante can't know when that's

19

going to happen.

MR. HACKER:

4

And that's why it's a

5

meaningfully different case.

6

plead in their complaint that there's a memo inside the

7

company, for example, so this false fact is going to

8

come out, and we know it's going to cause a stock drop,

9

that would be a case involving the materiality of a

10

If the plaintiffs have -­

media splash, a big media event.
It can't be that there's a false claim out

11
12

there somewhere and the company becomes aware of the

13

false claim and then, purely hypothetically, it's

14

possible that somebody will make the false claim.

15

becomes also possible that the media will pick up and

16

not be persuaded to ignore the false claim.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

MR. HACKER:

19

It

Well, Mr. Hacker -­

That's the kind of case we're

talking about here.

is an allegation he now has learned that it's the free

adverse reports, can you prove materiality and scienter

That's the

Justice Kagan started with the point that

11

the FDA doesn't require that.

Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of

explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure

because it depends on the nature of the study at issue.

It requires just

So given all of that -- and even in your

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In TSC and Basic, this Court reaffirmed the

16

longstanding rule that materiality is judged based on

17

the total mix of information available to investors.

18

Matrixx initially sought a major change to this Court's

19

contextual approach to materiality by offering a

20

bright-line standard of statistical significance.

In its reply brief, Matrixx offer -- offers

a rule that would apply only in the hypothetical

Honor, that very well might if the probability and the

magnitude of the harm -- if those five incidents were

In response to

Justice Alito, I heard you say something about a

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Correct.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That seems to me to

be a rather significant concession.

14

you're saying it's not simply the fact that some psychic

would say something, that that is not sufficient, even

16

if that has an impact on the market price, that there

17

has to be some scientifically plausible link to the

18

report.

I think this goes back to

20

Justice Kennedy's question as well, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

because there could very well be materiality.

22

information might be important for investors, but it

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

Well, I thought this might

6

come up.

At some point, do we look at scienter and then

7

go back from that to whether or not it's material, i.e.,

8

the argument would be the company knew that this would

9

affect the price, and that's why they didn't disclose

10

it, and therefore that shows it's material?

11

this with two isolated boxes -- one, materiality; two,

12

scienter -- and we don't mix the analyses?
MR. FREDERICK:

13

Or do we do

They're both analytically

14

distinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have

15

a simple answer for you because many of the reported

16

cases raise issues of both materiality and scienter.

17

What the Court has said in Basic is that the test is the

18

total mix of information and whether that -- under that

19

total mix, the investor would find that information

20

important.

21

not the inferences of scienter could be deemed -- were

22

as plausible as other inferences based on the mental

23

state of the people making the information.

24
25

In Tellabs, the Court said that whether or

So the Court has announced separate tests.
In a case like this, there is a natural overlap, and in

fact the other side has litigated this case on the basis

2

that no one would have thought within the company, based

3

on the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for

4

thinking there was information.

5

We plead the other way by saying that when

6

you have three medical specialists in three distinct

7

periods where the last wants to bring findings to the

8

leading ear, nose, and throat medical society suggesting

9

that, based on studies that go back as far back as the

10

1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on

11

the zinc ions, that's something that the company should

12

have taken seriously and disclosed to investors.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Frederick, suppose

14

you were the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new

15

drug, you've just put it out on the market, and you get

16

a report back, this drug has caused a death, right?

17

This is your first adverse effect report.

18

to disclose it?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Do you have

Well, I guess the first

20

thing I would say is, if the drug has not been FDA

21

approved, that would be material information that

22

investors might want to know.

23

approved and that report was then submitted to the FDA,

24

I think that there's a closer call depending on the, you

25

know, effect of the report that might be on the stock

If the drug had been FDA

price, because that's the only company product and the

2

other factors that we've mentioned in our brief.

3

4

obviously much more difficult than where there are

5

multiple events submitted by doctors with a

6

scientifically plausible basis on a product that's 70

percent of the company's revenues.

Well, in 1999, though,

5

Justice Breyer, Dr. Hirsch -- and this is outlined at

6

paragraph 25 of the complaint -- also said that

7

intranasal application of zinc could be problematic, and

8

he specifically asked about how much zinc is put in

Zicam precisely because of his awareness of prior

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

How was your -- that

14

long litany of factors that you mentioned a few minutes

15

ago about how a company will go about determining

16

whether an adverse event report is material or not or

17

should be disclosed or not -- are you saying that

18

companies don't have to respond to irrational securities

19

holders?

20

that on some level -- you said credible evidence -- that

21

they don't have to respond to things they judge are not

22

credible?

23

Are you accepting your adversary's proposition

MR. FREDERICK:

It really depends, Justice

24

Sotomayor, and I don't mean to be evasive, but if there

25

is a product, say, that has some link to satanic
38
Alderson Reporting Company

influences, and there is some reason to think that a

2

large body of followers in an irrational way might

3

regard there to be satanic influences on the basis of a

4

particular product, a cautious, reasonably prudent

5

investor might want to know that on the basis of that

6

information that most of us would regard as irrational,

7

might affect the stock price.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9

So what protection

is there at the summary judgment stage in response to

10

allegations?

11

scientifically valid; it can be completely irrational.

12

All you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had

13

told this, the price would have gone down.

14

told -- if you had disclosed this, the price would have

15

gone down.

16

but this is just ridiculous; this is some guy in his

17

garage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a

18

piece of paper in -- in handwriting.

19

is going to be, well, let's let the jury sort it out.

20

Because it doesn't have to be

If you had

And the response from the company is, well,

MR. FREDERICK:

And the response

There are two answers, Mr.

21

Chief Justice.

One is, in Basic itself, the Court

22

talked about the actions of a reasonable investor, and

23

this Court and many courts have always looked at a

24

reasonable person standard in making all sorts of these

25

fine judgments about the importance of particular
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

information.

But the second answer is -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

Well, you just told

3

me that it would be enough if somebody says that there's

4

a satanic, you know, impact on this, because a

5

reasonable investor would say there are enough crazy

6

people out there that this is going to affect the price.
MR. FREDERICK:

7

What I said was if the

8

product was one that might be, you know, attractive in

9

some way to people who had that particular following.

I

10

think you have to link up the product with the nature of

11

the complaint and the effect of the importance of the

12

information.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

So it matters

14

whether -- I don't know what kind of product has

15

particular satanic susceptibility -­

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -­
-- but I mean, are

19

you saying it matters if it's something that -- that

Satan's not going to be interested in?

satanic cults are going to be interested or not.

Well, Your Honor, there are

5

people who follow those things, and they spend money and

6

they buy stocks, but my second point is that scienter -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor.

14

And -- and you are saying, well, the reasonable investor

15

takes account of the irrationality.

16

that's what we meant in -- in Basic.

isn't part of this test.

21

credible scientific theory on a product that was

22

important to the company's finances and a very serious

side effect for a drug that had ready substitutes.

24
25

We certainly have here all of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So that --

I'm just trying to get your response to that.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

You just

Official - Subject to Final Review

talked again about credible scientists and all that, and

2

you're putting those other things to one side.
So even if you have your satanic problem,

3
4

that is not enough.

And you can sit there and allege it

5

would cause a drop of 30 percent in the stock price, and

6

you should have let this know -- your answer is no, they

7

don't have to let -- they don't have to disclose this

8

because there is no scientific credible basis for the

9

link that's alleged?
MR. FREDERICK:

10

Now, I'm saying two things.

11

One is that there's a difference between scienter and

12

materiality.

13

intent to deceive, and the questions are analytically

14

distinct.

15

think you merged them, and I'd like to keep them

16

separate because as we -- as this case comes to the

24

boundaries of the argument that you're making.

25

Let me give two hypotheticals, and they both

The second one is that a company receives a

On the second one, I would

17

there's not enough information about the side effect and

what the drug is intended to solve.

19

And I would say, on the first one,

I mean, the probability/magnitude test as

20

articulated by this Court goes to the probability of the

effect versus the magnitude that would be perceived by

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, your time

in your brief -- I haven't heard you say one word about

Now, that's something different from there
To what extent are you relying

MR. FREDERICK:

We're relying on those to

25

threats, to take Zicam off his poster presentation, and

Alderson Reporting Company

then later when they said that the reports of anosmia

2

were completely unfounded and "misleading," was the word

3

that they used.

4

that after the Good Morning America program came on,

5

only to say 3 weeks later, after empaneling a scientific

6

expert panel, that the information was insufficient to

7

make that determination.

8

enough.

"And misleading."

Our submission is that that is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

And they repeated

Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm

10

not clear on why you can draw a distinction between

11

materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue

12

before us here.

13

If, indeed, satanic effect is enough for

14

materiality, you say, well, it may not be enough for

15

scienter.

16

satanic effect is material, then the company has -­

17

knowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect

18

is irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter,

19

if it's material?

20

Why?

I mean, if the company knows that

The scienter is withholding something that

21

is material, that is known to be material, and once you

22

say that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the

23

company thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it

24

in its report, no?

25

MR. FREDERICK:

And it would depend on what

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

kind of stock effect occurred.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

2
3

between the materiality issue and the scienter issue.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

So there's no difference

Well -­
You can't push this problem

off onto the scienter side of the equation.
MR. FREDERICK:

7

It depends -- it depends on

8

this Court's application of its known precedent, which

10

argument, Basic, which says you look at the total mix of

11

the information.

13

And all of these things go into play.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

I get that.

Can I

14

just ask you one question in response to -- just picking

15

up on the last -- what about the need for a, quote,

16

"strong inference of scienter," end quote, and does this

17

complaint show more than a borderline situation where it

18

doesn't strongly infer that the person intended to

19

mislead the defendant?

20

What about that argument?

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, we believe, and they

21

haven't argued that this complaint is not sufficient

22

under the PSLRA, which set the heightened pleading

23

standard for scienter that this Court articulated and

24

construed in the Tellabs decision, so we believe that

scienter is adequately pleaded here based on -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, page 49 of their

2

brief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give

3

rise to a strong inference of scienter.
MR. FREDERICK:

4

What I'm saying is that

5

there's already a heightened pleading standard, Justice

6

Breyer.

7

say, is there some other heightened pleading standard

8

other than the one -­

I was not -- I misunderstood your question to

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

No, no, I mean -- I just

10

want to know why -- if their inference on materiality is

11

enough to survive the background noise reply, is it

12

enough to show a strong inference that they did do this

13

intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?
MR. FREDERICK:

14

The key aspects here are

15

their treatment of Jafek when Jafek was going to go

16

public with his scientifically linked claim of anosmia

17

from the Zicam, and then subsequently when they issued

18

press releases saying it would be completely unfounded

19

and misleading to assert any causal link.

sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter.

Now, to be sure, if someone just called a

is going to depend on what the actual reality is and

what the company's statements have been.
Now, if the company has made a statement

that, look, consumer confidence in our products is at an

all-time high and we expect sales to double in the next

quarter, and yet they are aware that there -- a consumer

6

boycott is being planned by, let's say, 10 percent of

that their company is tied to Satan, then certainly, to

correct their affirmative representation that consumer

confidence is at an all-time high and that they expect

their sales to double, a reasonable investor would want

to know that -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They haven't said that.

14

They haven't said our sales are going to double.

They're just rocking along at normal sales.

MR. SHAH:

MR. SHAH:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. SHAH:

Okay?

Well, Your Honor -­
What about that?

In that hypothetical, it depends

Alderson Reporting Company

Under

1

4

it's going to depend on what the company has said.

A company
So

Now, in your scenario, if a company has made

5

statements projecting their company's success into the

7

next quarter, for example, and they have a concrete

8

basis to know that, as your hypothetical submits,

9

10 percent of their computer -- consumer base is going

10

to leave the company's products, that is almost

11

certainly going to be material to an investor, and so,

12

yes, they would have to disclose that we have reason to

13

believe, however ridiculous it is and untrue it is, that

14

10 percent of our consumer base has decided to boycott

15

our product.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

you just said they would have a duty to disclose.

I thought you

earlier just said there's no affirmative duty to

MR. SHAH:

-- and not said anything about

other cases have long made clear that there has to be

16

MR. SHAH:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18
19

Sure, Your Honor -­
That's -- that triggers the

duty to disclose the satanic rumors?
MR. SHAH:

In certain cases where there are

20

very generalized statements -- for example, we think our

21

product will do well -- that may close -- come close to

22

the line of puffery that is a non-actionable statement

23

that no reasonable investor would rely on.

have never pressed that argument before this Court.

25

There is no dispute about whether the statements that

Alderson Reporting Company

2

agree with you that some of them probably come close to

that puffery line.
Here, though, we don't just have those

4

statements about the company being well positioned for

these were made to stock analysts that they expected a

been an argument in this case as to whether those less

15

specific and arguably puffery-type statements -­

Those statements certainly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

So the Government's

17

position is that reports of adverse effects that have no

18

scientific basis, so long as they would affect

19

irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming

20

the company has said we're doing well, right?
MR. SHAH:

21

Well, Your Honor, yes, I think it

22

would depend, again, on the statements the company

23

makes.

Well, I mean, if Satan

comes in, surely lousy science comes in as well, no?
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SHAH:

Okay.

So -- so, for example,

2

if a company had been faced with a potential adverse

3

effect and it had assembled a blue-ribbon panel of

4

scientists, conclusively determined that there is no

5

causal connection between this purported adverse effect

6

and their drug, the question is, would they have to

7

disclose in that circumstance?
I think if the company had simply made

8
9

statements relating to the drug safety -- we think our

10

drug is safe; there's no reason to believe that it

11

causes any adverse effects -- then the answer is no,

12

because the reported adverse effect would not call into

13

question the accuracy of the company's statements

14

relating to the safety of the drug.
If, however, the company had made specific

15
16

statements relating to consumer demand for its products

17

and it knew -- notwithstanding the fact that there was

18

no causal connection, it knew or had good reason to

19

believe that a significant portion of its consumer base

20

would avoid the product, then, yes, a reasonable

21

investor would want to know that information, and under

22

Basic the company would have a duty to disclose that,

23

even though unfounded, these reports may lead a

24

significant percentage of our consumer base to leave the

25

product.
53

I think that falls squarely within the

definition of materiality, which is would a reasonable

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shah, what deference do

5

you think that the SEC's understanding of materiality is

6

entitled to and why?
MR. SHAH:

7

Well, Your Honor, this Court in

deference based upon, one, its longstanding historical

16

practice in applying the materiality standard, which is

17

part of its own rule, Rule 10b-5, and its special

18

expertise in knowing what a reasonable investor would

19

want to know based upon its experience in this area.

20

So, I do think that, to the extent there is any

21

ambiguity remaining in this case, the Court should defer

22

to the SEC's views.

23

And back to Justice Breyer's questions about

24

what should the Court write simply beyond reiterating

25

the Basic standard, I think what the Court did in Basic
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was it not only articulated the general standard, but it

2

laid out some factors.

3

that's where the Court deferred to the SEC's brief.

4

it laid out factors that a reasonable investor might

5

find relevant.

And in laying out those factors,
And

In that case, it was the merger context.

And here, on page 28 of our brief, we lay

6
7

out several factors that we think bear on the

8

materiality question in this particular context; that

9

is, involving adverse drug information.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Is there any way

11

that consideration of those factors would support a -- a

12

summary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical

13

manufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely

14

poor lawyer drafting a complaint?

15

variety of factors like that -­

16

MR. SHAH:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Anytime you have a

Sure.
-- I think it's very

18

difficult for the judge to say anything other than

19

that's for the jury.
MR. SHAH:

20
21

If you mean at the motion to

dismiss stage, Mr. Chief Justice -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

I think there would be some

24

cases.

And, in fact, we know there are dozens of

25

12(b)(6) motions granted in securities fraud cases, and
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

let me lay out a few scenarios for you.
One would be in the -- in the scenario where

2
3

the company has not made any actionable statements.

4

has either -- statements to predicate a duty to

5

disclose.

It either has been made -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

No, no, I'm talking

7

about -- I'm talking about materiality.

8

words -­

9
10

MR. SHAH:

In other

Sure.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- based solely on

11

-- in other words, you're saying if they say anything

12

related, it's going to be enough -­

13

MR. SHAH:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

It

Sure.
-- whether it's a

scientific basis or not.
MR. SHAH:

Sure.

Two responses to that.

17

One, the PSLRA does have a safe harbor for companies

18

once they make forward-looking statements, that if they

19

add in meaningful cautionary language -- and this is in

20

the PSLRA itself, section 5(c)(1)(A) -- that if they add

21

in meaningful cautionary statements, then they cannot be

22

subject to liability.

23

other scenarios that would -- would trigger, for

24

example, if the product at issue is such a small

25

percentage of the company's income or expected growth

And I think there are a couple

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that no reasonable investor would care if it tanked,

2

then that might be a circumstance where a motion to

3

dismiss would be appropriate.

4

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Hacker, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. HACKER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'd like to return to Justice Kennedy's

11

question about the role of scienter here, which I think

12

absolutely is critical, as this Court emphasized

13

recently in the Merck v. Reynolds case.

14

Mr. Frederick correctly, I think, conceded

15

that there has to be a scientifically plausible basis.

16

And what you're talking about here is a company's

17

knowledge of a scientifically plausible basis.

18

has to make that concession in this case because of

19

what's alleged to be the material omission.

20

And he

The material omission is not knowledge of

21

dubious scientific -- medical claims.

It's not that we

22

got one phone call from a doctor.

23

omission is that the adverse event reports told Matrixx

24

that Zicam causes anosmia.

25

that -- that Matrixx supposedly did not disclose.

The real material

That's ultimately the fact

57
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so there has to be a basis for believing that -- there

2

has to be allegation in the complaint that's sufficient

3

to establish that Matrixx actually knew that Zicam

4

causes anosmia and yet willfully refused to tell

5

investors that fact.
And there's nothing in the complaint like

6
7

that.

There's not -- you're not talking about a case

8

where there was a failure to disclose the doctor's

9

completely dubious untested claim.

It's not a case -­

10

it's not the Satan case where you're talking about a

11

media splash, a known fact that there's going to be a

12

major media splash, and the company knows for a fact

13

that that splash is going to have the adverse effect on

14

the stock.

There's not even a claim here -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

As I was hearing the

16

Solicitor General's argument, he wasn't actually even

17

talking about causation.

18

statement you made about the company poised to double

19

its growth.

20

of what you had heard up until that time, you had to

21

have known that that statement was misleading, as was

22

the statement that this drug -- that there was

23

absolutely no proof or connection of causation, which

24

was your scientific panel said you couldn't make that

25

extreme statement.

He was talking about a

And I think he was saying that on the basis

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HACKER:

Well, two points, Your Honor.

2

First, if the claim was about, you know, the consumer

3

sales, you would need an allegation in the case that

4

consumer product sales were actually affected.

5

no allegation like that, and the truth is they weren't.

6

And so you're not talking about falsifying any prior

7

claim.

8

happened, Your Honor.

9

There's

There's not even an allegation that that

And, second, with respect to the -- the

10

statement, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg in

11

the beginning part of the argument, the statement was -­

12

what the scientific panel was addressing primarily was

13

Jafek's claim that Zicam causes anosmia, and the company

14

said accurately that that is completely unfounded and

15

misleading because there's no scientific support for it.

16

You can't go out and claim that Zicam causes anosmia

17

unless you have a scientific basis for that.

18

scientific panel was saying that isn't true.

19

And the

So the question is whether you can draw an

20

inference of scienter from the fact that -- from what's

21

alleged here, and there's simply no basis for an

22

allegation, supportable allegation, that the company

23

knew it causes anosmia and nevertheless refused to tell

24

investors that.

25

Thank you.
