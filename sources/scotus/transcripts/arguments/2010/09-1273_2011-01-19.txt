5

Clara County.

Ms. Blatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

There are three reasons why section 340B

12

entities do not have a cause of ation to enforce the

13

pharmaceutical pricing agreement between the Secretary

14

and manufacturers.

15

The first reason is that this common law

16

breach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an

17

implied right of action to enforce the statute, a right

18

Respondent concedes it does not have.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't understand that.

20

A private contract is just that.

Two parties go into

21

the contract.

22

forced the manufacturers to enter into this deal.

23

why isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said:

24

What was the intent of the parties to the contract?

25

want to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private

They set the terms of their deal.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

No one
So

You

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deal between you.

And Congress may have specified some

2

terms to include, but -­
MS. BLATT:

3

Yes.

And the -- what is being

4

challenged here is the contractual term that

5

incorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling

6

price obligations under the Act, and a third-party

7

beneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the

8

same right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the

9

same disruptions as a right of action to enforce the

10

statute.

11

And another way of saying that is, if the

12

case begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed

13

340B entities from bringing an implied right of action

14

through the front door, Congress did not leave the back

15

door open to essentially the same suit.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

How do you answer the

17

point that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure

18

regulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a

19

contract?

20

anyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States

21

or to the 340B entities -- you can't charge more than

22

this price.

23

It would have just passed a statute that says

Why do we even need a contract, unless

24

inherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's

25

administering it?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. BLATT:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Right.

Well -­
Discretion that is

consistent with normal contract principles.
MS. BLATT:

4

Right.

Well, our position is

5

obviously that the parties had no discretion to confer

6

Article III power on courts to enforce an Act of

7

Congress, and this is.

8

that there has always been a huge difference between the

9

settled rule that parties to a statutory contract are

10

enforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce

11

the contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously

12

clear language that the parties could sue.

13

way statutory contracts must work.

14

enforceable.

15

But the -- the basic answer is

That's the

They must be

But your answer, sort of as a practical

16

matter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a

17

contract, and we do think that the Federal law of

18

contracts and contractual remedies flow between the

19

parties to the contract.

20

it's not a regulation, and the Secretary made specific

21

enforceable promises.

22

operation of the statutory mandate without the contract.

23

It's a bilateral agreement,

And there's obviously no even

But the reverse, in terms of the -- the

24

long-settled rule that parties must be able to sue to

25

enforce a contract, there's an equally settled rule that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to

2

enforce it unless there's a cause of action.
Now, the test that I think Respondent

3
4

advocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test

5

this Court has long since discarded, which is:

6

I'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is

7

sensible.

8

imply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are

9

neither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress

10

intended.

Well,

Even if you don't buy our test of you have to

And here's why.
And it is basically the second and third

11
12

reasons.

13

lens through which you look at this, I think everyone

14

should come out to the same place, which is that neither

15

Congress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed

16

up to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000

17

lawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the

18

pricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid.

19

So no matter how you come at this case and the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your adversary claims

20

you gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make

21

the manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary.

22

Have you given up that argument?

23

MS. BLATT:

No.

I think that the -- that

24

the whole thrust of the petition -- and obviously the

25

primary argument is that this flouts the implied right
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of action jurisprudence and it -- it conflicts with

2

congressional intent in all events.

3

harms, and sort of illustrating just how bad the

4

decision was, is this conferred rights that the parties

5

never imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not

6

intend.

But one of the

But I -- I think that, in our view, even if

7
8

the Secretary had wanted to, it's not the Secretary's

9

decision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go

10

contract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar

11

health care program that incorporates another, even

12

bigger multi-billion dollar health care program -- we're

13

going to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on

14

the face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision

15

by Congress to withhold -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MS. BLATT:

Private enforcement.

Private enforcement -- to

18

withhold a private remedy in favor of 340B entities and,

19

instead, channel exclusive authority to the Secretary to

20

enforce it.

21

the disruption, are that Congress gave manufacturers,

22

but not 340B entities, a private reimbursement remedy

23

and a private -­

24
25

And those three specifics, in addition to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it -- I'm not

sure of the answer, but is it different in this case or
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unusual that the agreement is between the Federal

2

Government and private entities, as opposed to what I

3

think is the more typical situation in which these cases

4

come up, where it's, say, an agreement between the

5

Federal Government and a State?

6
7

MS. BLATT:

Well, all your Medicaid cases,

obviously, under State plans -­

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

-- and a lot of your implied

10

right of action jurisprudence is dealing with Spending

11

Clause legislation as to State entities.

12

a number, a number -- the Rehabilitation Act, the

13

Davis-Bacon Act, and a fair number of health care

14

programs -- where the government contracts with private

15

parties as a public welfare mechanism to get to what I

16

think are conceded are beneficiaries.

17

But there are

Here, there's a number of beneficiaries.

18

It's not just the 340B entities.

19

population that's being served and, obviously, the

20

Federal fisc.

21

It's the patient

So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Blatt, would you

22

explain the function that the contract mechanism serves?

23

I mean, you could just have this -- you could just have

24

the statute say:

25

ceiling price.

Thou shalt not charge more than the
Period.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

What -- what is accomplished by having the
contract reflecting the terms of the statute?
MS. BLATT:

3

Well, I don't think it's any

4

different than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where

5

Congress wants to specify the terms of the contract, and

6

the contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory

7

terms.

8

contractual remedies that flow.

And if there's a breach of that, there are

But I agree with you that there's not a

9
10

whole lot difference between our position and the

11

Government, because the Government is absolutely correct

12

that it's in haec verba and identical, and the statutory

13

obligation that we're talking about that's incorporated

14

into the contract is that a certain ceiling price must

15

be charged.

16

But the -- the other sort of practical

17

function is only manufacturers who enter into this

18

contract are subject to these price controls.

19

they -- a pharmaceutical manufacturer doesn't want to

20

participate in the program, they're not covered.

21

So if

And in a typical regulation and I think

22

general sort of Spending Clause analysis, someone who

23

accepts Federal funding has considered sort of implicit

24

consent to the funding obligations because they're

25

taking the money.

But here's there's an express
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

manifestation both by the Secretary who signed the

2

agreement and the contractors, the pharmaceutical

3

companies who signed the agreement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Before the statute was

5

amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there

6

was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess

7

penalties?

8

MS. BLATT:

Well -­

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because -- and the reason

10

I'm asking this is that you indicate that the government

11

had a contract remedy.

12

regulatory remedy.

13
14
15

MS. BLATT:

It seemed to me it had a

It has got a lot of remedies.

It has -- but it -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What was the contract

16

remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which

17

was before the -- these mechanisms.

18

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

They're -- right.

We are

19

still -- today is no different than yesterday, because

20

nothing has happened to implement the 2010 health care

21

reform except that there are now more civil monetary

22

penalties than there were.

23

But the government has statutory penalties,

24

civil monetary penalties, a right of audit.

25

bring suits under the False Claims Act and can terminate
10
Alderson Reporting Company

It can

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

both this agreement and the Medicaid rebate agreement.

2

But as a -- the government has contractual

3

remedies, too.

4

sensible inference for why Congress picked contracts is

5

that this is -- this piggybacks off the Medicaid rebate

6

program, and that uses contracts.

7

that in turn, rather, used contracts because the States

8

had negotiated rebate agreements with drug companies way

9

before 1990.

10

I mean, why Congress, I think -- a

And that instead -­

feature.
And then, since the pricing components under

11
12

this program are the same pricing components under the

13

Medicaid rebate program, both programs are parallel and

14

that both use agreement, one is the Medicaid rebate

15

agreement.

In this case, it's the pharmaceutical -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Ms. Blatt, you said that

17

there's not a whole lot of difference between your

18

position and the Government's.

19

between your position and the Government's?
MS. BLATT:

20

What is the difference

Well, the Government says a

21

contract is not a contract even though it says it's a

22

contract.

23
24
25

Our position is this a contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't make much

sense, does it?
MS. BLATT:

The -- the Government sees this,
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I think, as just a unilateral -- that the manufacturers

2

walked in and said we're here and happy to be bound.

3

But the agreement on its face says the Secretary makes

4

the following agreement; the Secretary promises this.
The most important promise the Secretary

5
6

made to manufacturers is that the Secretary said that

7

she would not terminate the agreement without good

8

cause, 60 days' notice, and certain conduct that the

9

manufacturer did would not constitute grounds for

10

termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

What did the manufacturer

12

promise in exchange for a contract?

What did they promise that they weren't

if they're right?

So what are they supposed to do

How do they get the money?

MS. BLATT:

3

Well, the way they have been

4

getting the money, and for better or worse until 2010,

5

they have been at the mercy of the vastly larger

6

Medicaid rebate program, which is run on behalf of the

7

States.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why is it

reasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have

10

entered into a contract which is going to benefit them

11

and there's no remedy?

12

MS. BLATT:

Because the statute itself said:

13

We're going to go out of our way to give manufacturers

14

remedies, make this confidential; manufacturers have

15

rights of audit, but 340B entities don't.

16

-- here's a vast arsenal of things at your disposal, and

it's channeled through that regulatory regime.

Well, to the extent that

you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary,

there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a

7

It's the private party who's assigned the claim.

mean, the case is brought in the name of, and it is a

because the United States has complete and total control

Yes?

If it's not enforced in the

plaintiffs always lose under a third-party beneficiary

But if you had an express provision outside

the statute that said we intend to confer enforceable

19

rights on third parties, and it's not an enforcement of

20

the statute at all, then all your jurisprudence for

21

determining congressional intent aren't being subverted

22

and aren't being undermined.
I could give you an example.

23

I mean, it

24

could be anywhere from something just completely outside

the statute.

Together, the pharmaceutical companies
17
Alderson Reporting Company

could say we hereby agree to make a contribution every

2

year to the clinic or hospital for a holiday gift.

would be an odd contract.

entering into third-party beneficiary contracts.

more efficient way would just be to contract with the

saying that a lot of the energy and breath in the court

11

intent, by and large, is going to line up with the

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The pharmaceutical pricing agreement should

22

not be construed to permit 340B entities to bring suit

23

to enforce drug manufacturers' price reporting

24

requirements for two reasons:

25

ordinary contract, and it does not transform the 340B

First, the PPA is not an

program from a regulatory scheme into a contractual one.

Like a Medicare provider -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it -- is it a

contract at all?
MS. ANDERS:

It's not an ordinary contract

6

in that it doesn't give rise to contract rights in

7

the -- in the regulated entities.

8

to Medicare provider agreements, in which a health care

9

provider who wants to enter into the Medicare program

This is very similar

10

and provide services agrees -- signs an agreement in

11

which he agrees to abide by the statutes and regulations

12

set forth in the Medicare program and, in return for

13

that agreement, is given the opportunity to participate

14

in the Medicaid -- in the Medicare program.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how do we distinguish

16

between what you call an ordinary contract and this sort

17

of a contract, if it's any kind of contract?

18

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think when the statute

19

directs an agency to enter into an agreement for the

20

sole purpose of memorializing the parties' opt-in to the

21

regulatory scheme and directs -- directs what the terms

22

shall be, so here provides statutorily what the

23

reporting requirements will be, that's when the

24

contract is simply a regulatory mechanism.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, are you telling

me you're taking -- then your -- then your co-counsel is

2

right; you're agreeing with her totally.

3

wrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to

4

give you in a contract, you figure out how to implement

5

and enforce this, and the Secretary says I don't have

6

the resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a

7

contract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of

8

action, the manufacturers can take it or leave it -­

9

you're taking the position that the Secretary is without

10

If Congress

authority to do this?
MS. ANDERS:

11

I think it would be a difficult

12

question.

13

say that the Secretary was completely without authority.

14

I think what has happened here is the Secretary has

15

reasonably interpreted the statute in providing for an

16

agreement between the Secretary and the manufacturers to

17

simply mark the opt-in.

18

I think it would be a difficult argument to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that begs the

19

question that Justice Alito asked you, which is:

20

go your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some

21

sort of other contract, how do we tell the difference,

22

and do we need to go that far?

23

thought half of your -- other half of your position was

24

that this is not a third-party intended beneficiary.

25

If we

Isn't your position -- I

All the terms of the contract are between
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations

2

to the Secretary, not the obligations to the third

3

parties.

4

MS. ANDERS:

That's exactly right.

I

5

think -- to take the first part of your question, I

6

think the Court can tell when this is a regulatory

7

contract when the statute itself simply directs the

8

agency to enter into an agreement that -- that contains

9

the terms that are set forth in the statute.

And when

10

you look at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is a

11

regulatory scheme.

12

The government is not acting as a

13

contracting party here.

It's acting as a regulator.

14

has the authority to impose administrative penalties

15

which would be reviewed under the APA.

16

transaction that's taking place with the government.

17

The only rules governing the conduct are statutory.

18

that's why we think you can tell that this is not an

19

ordinary contract.

There's no

It's a regulatory one.

14

regulatory scheme, including in the Medicare provider

15

area, where you do have these agreements with health

17

that the -- the entire area is regulated by breach of

contract law rather than by the, you know, hundreds of

govern the providers' rights there.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you tell us whether

22

you agree with the Petitioner's argument in part D of

its brief that private suits would seriously disrupt the

comprehensive statutory scheme, in light of the position

25

involving actions brought by States, In re

MS. ANDERS:

4

We do agree with the

5

Petitioners that -- that permitting third-party

6

beneficiary suits here, if you construe this as a

7

contract, would interfere with the government's ability

8

to administer the statutory scheme.

9

This is a national

Rebate Act, which has -- which is heavily regulated.

11

Allowing 14,000 covered entities to bring individual

13

without the benefit of the government's input, could

14

lead to substantial dis-uniformity despite the fact that

15

these are supposed to be national prices.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

You're walking away from

17

your position in the District of Massachusetts?

18

States do not have, according to you, the right to

19

enforce the rebate program?
MS. ANDERS:

20

No.

The

That's actually an

21

important point.

I think in the Medicaid context the

22

States have a cooperative relationship with the Federal

it is contemplated that they have their own enforcement

so why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?
MS. ANDERS:

11

Well, in the covered entity

12

context, the concern is that, because you have so many

13

of them, if you -- if you start permitting covered

14

entities to bring suit, you know, this is essentially a

15

pre-emption question, but you then have 50 different

16

State regimes, State court regimes, put onto -- grafted

17

onto, the Medicaid rebate requirements.
This is supposed to be a uniform pricing

18
19

scheme.

20

dis-uniform, it becomes very difficult for HHS to

21

administer the scheme in the way that it's supposed to.

22

And so once the requirements become

I think it's also important to point out

23

that the recently enacted Affordable Care Act will

extent it had concerns about enforcement by covered

entities -- the way it reacted was not to create a

itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

was to put in place this administrative remedy which

So I understand your

position clearly, in a regulatory contract situation

7

like this one the Secretary is without authority to

8

decide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer

expressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to

10

the -- to the people receiving the benefit?

11

position you're taking?

That's the

If the Secretary had written a provision

12
13

into this contract telling 340B entities you can sue,

14

that would have been, according to you, ultra vires?
MS. ANDERS:

15

I think it would be difficult

16

to say that the agency would have been totally without

17

authority to do that.

answer here, because I think the PPA clearly shouldn't

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I'd like to start with Ms. Blatt's answer to

your question about whether a provision of the agreement

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Third-party beneficiary

beneficiary has rights under -- under the normal

contract only when the parties intend him to have

23

rights.

It's not that every -- every contract which -­

There has to be an intent.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

And I -- I have

trouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on

2

the part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have

3

had that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did

4

not have the intent to allow private individuals to sue?
MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Scalia, you find the

intent in part II(a) of the agreement, which is set

forth in the petition appendix.

agreement agrees that the entity -- that the entity will

Yes, you didn't -- you

-- who are specified in the

agreement.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

My question was the mere

19

fact that there's a duty to a third party in the normal

20

contract does not give that third party the right to

21

sue, only if the contracting parties intend the

22

third-party beneficiary to have a right to sue.

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, that's not the

standard, Justice Scalia.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. FREDERICK:

The standard for a

third-party beneficiary, as set forth in the Restatement

and as recognized by this Court, is whether or not the

MR. FREDERICK:

The Government cannot argue

22

for subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I don't

2

understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same

3

as what you said.

4

Restatement of Contracts.

5

is whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an

6

objective intent -- to confer these rights on a third

7

person.

8

then it seems to me that your answer that you gave was

9

just what Justice Scalia said.

You said no, Justice Scalia,
But what he said the question

And -- and you said no, no, that's not it.

MR. FREDERICK:

10

But

I -- I missed something.

Okay.

Here's what I think I

11

misunderstood perhaps from Justice Scalia's question.

12

For third-party beneficiary rights to create an

13

enforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the

14

contract do not have to have a provision in the contract

15

saying "and therefore the intended third parties get to

16

bring a breach of contract claim."

17

the accepted law.

That's never been

The law has always said if the parties

18
19

intend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing

20

of that suit to enforce the contract would be within the

21

objective intent of the parties, such a suit is

22

permissible.

23

Now, I want to caution that what is

24

different about this suit from the kinds of implied

25

rights of action suits that the drug companies here
33
Alderson Reporting Company

claim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for

is the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to

undertake.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could that be -- could there

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, could there be -­
Third-party -- I'm

sorry.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Could there be a

15

third-party -- a suit by an intended beneficiary and a

16

purported intended beneficiary, if it is clear that

17

Congress intended, to the extent it can intend

18

something, for those beneficiaries to get the benefit of

19

the price but did not intend for them to be able to sue?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if there were -­

22

MR. FREDERICK:

I think indirectly here,

23

Justice Alito, that the patients here certainly are

24

incidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't

25

afford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the

This is county money that we're

Or if they have some limited

So they are certainly incidental

4
5

beneficiaries, but because they are not named and

6

because the intent of the program is to provide the 340B

7

entities with discounted drugs so they can extend scarce

8

dollars farther, they have no right to sue.
JUSTICE ALITO:

9

If there were a provision in

10

the law saying expressly there is no private right of

11

action under this statute, would you be able to make the

12

same argument?
MR. FREDERICK:

13

No.

Our argument rests on

14

the silence of contract with respect to how enforcement

15

would concur.

16

where the parties intend to displace a third-party

17

beneficiary's rights, the objective intent of the -- of

18

the agreement is what is understood.

It has long been the case, though, that

money that's being spent.

Well, that's true -- that's

true, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale

19

unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended

20

to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit.

21

well, gee, I don't know.

arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but

23

they say there are two major points here that favor them

24

about background.

25

You could -- the distributor and the
Pretty

And I think,

And what the Government is

I want to hear what your reply is.

One of them is Congress, in the statute that
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be

2

able to enforce it.

3

create a mess.

4

background features here that favor them.

And the second one is it's going to

All right?

So they say those are two

5

So what's your response?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Number one, there's no

7

evidence that Congress intended there to be a departure

8

from normal operating contract principles, and this

9

Court, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in

10

Central Airlines -- all said that when Congress uses

11

contracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the

12

full cluster of the common law rights as they've

13

existed.

14

recognized for 350 years, even before the founding of

15

this republic.

And third-party beneficiary rights have been

Now, as to the disruption, I think it's a

16
17

canard, because what we're talking about here is one

18

price that would govern all 14,500 covered entities.

19

if Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say,

20

that is the best price, and it will be charged and

21

chargeable to all of the 340B entities across the

22

nation.

So

23

So in terms of administrability, one suit

24

actually can solve the deficiencies in the government

25

enforcement program, and the government can participate

in this suit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

Well, which way does

3

that cut?

4

and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one

5

lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit

6

saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from

7

this program; we think we should get less.
And if they win, the whole country's -- the

8

That seems to me to put an awful lot of power

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Well -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That strikes me as

12

an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the

13

Secretary.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

No, I think it's an argument

15

that may misunderstand some of the benefits that class

16

action practice can provide, where there is a uniform

17

way of analyzing the problem, because these prices,

MR. FREDERICK:

is that if it is more efficient -­

class action because the County of Santa Clara stands in

California and the other counties in the United States

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

What do you think

about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here,

10

but as I understand the development of this argument

11

today, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go

12

to the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit,

13

okay?

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't know that the

21

than under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set

22

forth in the joint appendix, where the States are the

23

third-party beneficiaries of those agreements.

24
25

The -- this is a different agreement

I'm not sure that the State actually has
standing to bring these particular claims.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

That is not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

something that has been tested.

But what I would say is

2

that if you reject our argument here, you are

3

substantially undercutting the ability of the States to

4

bring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug

5

manufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program.
That's what the States' amicus brief here

6
7

makes clear.

The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the

8

very end of the Government's brief that does not set

9

forth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B

10

entities' third-party beneficiary rights are any

11

different from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate

12

program.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

I thought it was because

14

the States have been given a role in the statute itself,

15

where the 340B entities have not.

16

the -- the Government's position, that the States have a

17

role in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely

18

different thing than this program, where these entities

19

have no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and

20

then HHS.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

I thought that was

Justice Ginsburg, I don't

22

think that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in

23

the District of Massachusetts, which looked at the

24

third-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving

25

them a place at the table in bringing these kinds of
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

claims.

2

anything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's

3

theory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that

4

suggest a blurring of the normal lines between

5

regulation and contract.

6

And to the extent that that analysis bears out

That theory, the regulatory contract theory,

7

has been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil

8

Oil, where the Government tried to argue that because it

9

was implementing regulatory policy through contracts,

10

somehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this

11

Court rejected that.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the Government's

13

footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract.

14

says that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis

15

that the court applied in the District of Massachusetts

16

case, but it was explaining why, in the Government's

17

view, it's a different situation.

18

And what it said, it's a different

19

situation, not because of a different contract, but

20

because in that other situation, Medicaid -- the

21

Medicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, "a

22

cooperative Federal-State program."

23
24
25

It

I mean, their point is that the States are
explicitly given authority for enforcement in that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And here the entities

you're representing are not.
MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Scalia, and that is

4

why resort to the normal canons of construction that

5

this Court has long applied to government contracts is

6

what is most pertinent here.

7

think, can point to a specific provision of the

8

cooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in

9

any greater enforcement power than a normal third-party

The Government, I don't

10

beneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to

11

Central Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred

12

years ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right

13

to bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the

14

absence of a specific enforcement power in the statute

15

was not enough to deny the normal operation of law for

16

the breached party to sue for that breach.

17

That's common in the law.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The big -- the big

19

difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the

20

States are sovereign.

The entities at issue here are not sovereigns.

But under the -- under the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

2

think if you took that argument to its logical extreme,

3

you would have come to a different answer in the Arthur

4

Andersen case, where, there, you recognized a

5

third-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to

6

get an arbitration agreement upheld.
And I think you would have come to a

7
8

different result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in

9

which the Court said that just because there is an FAA

10

contract with a local airport authority does not deny a

11

third-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an

12

adverse effect on adjoining land because you would have

13

said that, because the adjoining land owner had no

14

specific enforcement authority, that person or entity

15

would be out of luck.

I think the -- this Court's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

That's Miree.

17

That's 1977.

18

me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action

19

jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last

20

30 years.

21

And a lot of your argument, it seems to

And what concerns me is when you are talking

22

about the same language, the mere fact that the

23

government has decided to go through a contractual

24

mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to

25

use that to get an end run around all of the implied
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years.

2

You're on stronger ground before that.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, let me address that

4

directly, Mr. Chief Justice, because Justice Rehnquist,

5

who was not any fan of implied rights of action, was the

6

author for the Court's opinion in the Miree decision.

7

And -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

Well, but that was

9

pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent

10

with the established jurisprudence in this area then.

11

But it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I

12

think about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the

13

other direction, to the point now where I think the

14

jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to

15

imply a private right of action at all.
MR. FREDERICK:

16

We're not asking you to

17

imply a private right of action, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

We're asking you to honor contract principles that have

24

right of action to enforce the terms of the statute.

25

The contract embodies the terms of statute.

You can call it whatever you

It's -- Congress has not provided for a private

45
Alderson Reporting Company

So it would

Official - Subject to Final Review

be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress,

2

said we want private parties out of this; this is to be

What's

the difference between suing because the statute has

15

participate.

16

The manufacturer can choose not to

So in every one of the implied right of

17

action cases that you have dealt with, a -- an outside

18

entity has been forced to comply with a statute or law.

19
20
21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the statute wouldn't

apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.
MR. FREDERICK:

But the -- Justice Ginsburg,

22

those cases all involve the imposition of duties on the

23

part of an entity or actor out in society.

24
25

Here we're talking about voluntary action.
The drug manufacturers can decide not to participate and
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not sign the agreement.
And they have the right, under the

2
3

provisions allowing termination, to terminate the

4

agreement at will with no reason whatsoever.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

But -­

But so do the -­

6

it's the same situation with the States under Spending

7

Clause legislation.

8

they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of

9

action on the beneficiaries?

They don't have to sign up, but if

10

25, 30 years have said no.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

And our cases for the last

But the remedy is different,

12

Mr. Chief Justice.

And that is a key difference.

13

we're talking about here as a remedy is the difference

14

between what they promised to charge and what they

15

actually charged.

The remedies -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

All

But we're told that

17

whatever you say -- that's all we're talking about.

18

are told that computing the price is a very intricate

19

business and that many of these disputes have been about

20

what is -- what should the ceiling price be.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

There -­
There would not -- the

23

ceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about

24

it.

25

to charge that price and not a higher price.

It's just a question of getting the manufacturers

47
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question is:

What is the ceiling price?
MR. FREDERICK:

2

And there are two ways to

3

calculate it.

Under the more complicated formula that

4

is designed to enhance the profits of the drug

5

companies, it is a more complicated endeavor.
All of these cases, Justice Ginsburg, all of

6
7

them, have been with the simple formula, which is has

8

the drug company given its best price to some other

9

purchaser in the market.

That's where the False Claims

10

Act cases that they acknowledge do not create such an

11

intrusion into the program that somehow they can't be

12

brought -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13
14

they have control over them.

15

control over these suits.
MR. FREDERICK:

16

But that's -- and then
And they don't have

Well, no, the difference in

17

a qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague

18

earlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the

19

government doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims

20

Act case.

21

What's different there is that there has to

22

be some inside whistleblower who can pass through the

23

very difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case;

24

whereas here we're talking about benefit of the bargain.

25

The manufacturers agreed by contract they were only
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to charge a ceiling price, and we assert, based

2

on, you know, quite extensive reports by officers of

3

Inspectorate General that they have not been charging

4

that price.

5

price, and all we're asking for is the delta.

They've been charging in excess of that

6

And the Government in its Massachusetts

7

submissions has acknowledged that this type of best

8

price litigation is not so complicated because all one

9

needs to do is figure out did the drug companies sell

10

the particular drug to some other entity for a lower

11

price; and if that's so, that's the price you apply

12

across the board to all the 340B entities.
The argument about distraction and

13
14

intrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully

15

submit, is a gross overstatement of what actually

16

happens in this type of litigation.

17

that there are complexities, the complexities are

18

introduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of

19

masking what price they are charging to the 340B

20

entities.

21

bundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to

22

purchasers are all designed to mask what the true price

23

of the drug is.

24
25

And to the extent

Because all these various mechanisms, the

And if Congress intended anything in the
program, and in getting the Secretary to implement this
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

program through statutes, it was that the 340B entities

2

who are providing drugs and medical service to the

3

poorest of our citizens should be entitled to the

4

benefits of the collective market created by these 340B

5

drug purchases.

6

here.

And that's all that we're asking for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

Do you take the position

8

that nothing has changed as a result of the new

9

legislation?

That is, Ms. Anders told us that this

10

statute is going into -- to become effective.

11

going to be procedures, better procedures than there

12

were before.

13

beneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to

14

the agency?

Is there still this third-party

MR. FREDERICK:

15

There's

We don't know, Justice

16

Ginsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give

17

you.

18

Secretary has already missed the first statutory

19

deadline for issuing implementing regulations.

20

And the reason we don't know is because the

There was no statement of rules in the

21

notice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case

22

for agencies.

23

that we are going to develop procedures and rules.

24

we don't know whether or not the Secretary will express

25

some further intent as to how these new rules are to

The Secretary simply put out for comment

50
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

apply.
But I would submit that this Court's cases

2
3

are very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is

4

not intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and

5

the absence of any specific remedial provision coupled

6

with the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary

7

presumption that Congress intended for that cluster of

8

common law rights to be associated with the agreement.
And that's certainly been the way this Court

9
10

has enforced contracts involving the government itself.
If there are no further questions, we'll

11
12

submit.

20

you want, I can also talk about States.

21

And if

We take, obviously, deep umbrage at the

22

suggestion that the drug companies are somehow against

clinics.
And I'd also -- probably even a better

2
3

response is you can look at any rebate release issued by

4

the Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if

5

you think it's simple, I would be shocked.
On Lipitor, it's not the case that the

6
7

Central District of California decides nationwide what

8

the price of Lipitor is.

9

view, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern

The -- under the other side's

10

District of New York, and the District in Alabama would

11

all decide.

12

And what's really bad -- it is bad enough to

13

have 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs, but what he's

14

talking about, best price and average manufacturer price

15

that determines the State rebate program -- because the

16

rebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price

17

program is a ceiling price, when one of the pricing

18

components goes up, such as average manufacturer price,

19

the States benefit.

20

generally, 340B entities -- their ceiling price goes up.

21

So what's good for the 340B company -- or entity is bad

22

for the States.

23

They get more money.

And that's not disputed.

But,

the same.

with the statute, it's congressional intent that's

controlling, not the parties.
