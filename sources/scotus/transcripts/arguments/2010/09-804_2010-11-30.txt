ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Congress crafted a carefully balanced ERISA

12

enforcement scheme that enables plan participants to

13

recover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) and

14

equitable remedies for ERISA violations under section

15

502(a)(3).

16

In this case, Respondents are seeking a

17

remedy for misleading plan summaries that violated

18

ERISA.

19

plan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies,

20

not for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B).

21

that governs the relief that is sought is a necessary

22

antecedent to any of the other questions in this case,

23

and ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has

24

repeatedly said the Court is not interested and does

25

not -- is not willing to alter the structure that

The section

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress carefully crafted and carefully developed over

2

the years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA

3

programs.

4

And the scheme is such that, if there is a

5

participant to the plan who is seeking benefits under

6

that plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsection (a)(1)(B)

7

of section 502 provides for relief under the plan.

8

there are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3)

9

provides for equitable relief.

10

If

That is the scheme

carefully developed by Congress.

11

Now, in this case what happened is that

12

Cigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from

13

a defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, a cash

14

value plan.

15

summaries of the new plan that the district court found,

16

and the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in -­

in the sense that they did not provide all of the

18

information necessary for plan participants to evaluate

19

what was happening.

And it put out, as required by ERISA,

In other words -- they were not accurate.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, when you say

8

the employees had no choice, but the district court

9

found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary

10

being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared

11

that there might be a backlash on the part of the

12

employees if they found out, if they were told the truth

13

about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable,

14

that they would not have the same benefits that they had

15

under the prior plan?

16

MR. OLSON:

That is correct, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

18

could adopt a change in the plan, as it did.

19

permitted under ERISA, but it was required to give

20

accurate summaries.

21

They had no choice in the sense that Cigna
That was

The choice that you're suggesting and the

22

district court was concerned about is that an individual

23

could have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was

unhappy with the change in the plan, or the district

25

court said there could have been some sort of a protest.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Olson, we have

8

several times referred to the plan as having a range of

9

documents associated with it, not as having just a

10

single written instrument, but we referred to documents

11

and instruments governing the plan.

on.

We did that in

numerous occasions, that there are documents and

18

that govern the plan.
MR. OLSON:

And one would think that

It's quite clear from the

20

structure of the statute that is correct, as you

21

suggest, that there may be multiple instruments or

22

documents that are the -- create the plan itself.

23

the summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the

that the -- that the statute saying what is in the

the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is

13

supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the

14

15

MR. OLSON:

Well, the written instruments,

as these things turn out, are long, complex documents.

They may be 90, 100 pages long.

the opposite?

Because the statute seems to be written

MR. OLSON:

And together, they all somehow

Well, I -- I submit that that is

Alderson Reporting Company

not the way the statute is written, and subsections (2)

2

and (4) of the provision that I was referring to make

3

that clear if the word "summary" itself did not make

4

that clear.

5

referred to in your earlier question also proves that.

6

Curtiss-Wright case talked about a summary

But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you

8

using "plan," "summary plan description," in different

9

terms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the

10

district court here held, unless the plan specifically

11

says that it may be modified in a certain way and that

12

the summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan.

13

the Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this

14

Court -- was referring to the summary as something that

15

was separate, that might modify the plan if the plan

16

itself allows for it to be modified in that fashion.

17

So

Now, the Government says that the summary

plan description is a part of the plan and so do

Respondents.

21

of the plan.

its opinion, that it was a modification, it was an

23

amendment to the plan.

district court said was that they would treat the plan

as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it

was part of the plan itself, not an amendment,

I thought that was what the district court

MR. OLSON:

I think in the -- on page of

10

petition, page 218, which is the district court's -- the

11

conclusions of the district court's decision.

12

13

that the terms of Part B have been correspondingly

14

modified by the SPDs.

Under

The court was saying -- I think you were

referring, Justice Ginsburg, to the relief that the

court ordered, but the court was ordering that relief on

the theory that the SPDs modified the plan.

19

plan itself, under Curtiss-Wright, doesn't provide for

20

it to be amended in that way.

21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the SPDs -­
It can't be part of the

MR. OLSON:

And the SPDs,

3

Joint Appendix, specifically say that if there's any

4

5

governs.

6

at the bottom of 922a.

7

The language is at the bottom of, for example,
So -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the SPD can't negate the

8

force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has

9

to be consistent with the plan documents, nothing in the

10

SPD can negate that requirement.

11

MR. OLSON:

That's correct.

No one -- but

12

Congress did consider prohibiting a provision like that

13

in SPDs, that they could not disclaim, they could not

14

say that if there's any inconsistency, the plan

15

governed, and Congress did not adopt such a provision.

16

This is a perfectly legal provision, to tell

17

someone that if there's any discrepancy -- and there's

18

bound to be discrepancies, the -- as I said, the plans

19

themselves can be 90, 100 pages, very long and very

complex.

That's why there is an SPD that can't contain

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. OLSON:

That's Catch 22, because if

there's a -- if there's a discrepancy because they have

we're faced with the proposition that someone's going to

provisions that can have operative effect regardless of

15

whether they pass through a formal amendment procedure.

16

MR. OLSON:

Curtiss-Wright talked

It

It seems to me -- I think we

17

might disagree about that, respectfully.

18

the sense of the opinion in Curtiss-Wright was that if

you're going to say that this SPD modifies the plan, it

20

can only do so if the plan permits the SPD to modify the

But I

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BRUCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

16

Our position is that detrimental reliance is

17

not found in section 102 of ERISA, which establishes the

18

summary plan description requirement.

19

section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA, which establishes the

20

fiduciary duty that's in accordance with the plan

21

documents and instruments, plural, insofar as consistent

22

with the provisions of this title.

23

It's not found in

It's also not consistent with any language

in section 502(a), either in 502(a)(1)(B) or 502(a)(3).

equitable relief to redress a violation of Title I or a

2

violation of the terms of the plan.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that seems to me

4

like just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you

5

must recover under the plan, because if reliance is not

6

required then there must be some basis on which you must

7

recover, and that recovery must be under the plan.

8

it's -- it's -­

9

MR. BRUCE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, if you say -- if

11

you say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see

is your argument, under the first -- under the first

MR. BRUCE:

Under -- our understanding is

19

that under either (a)(1)(B) or (a)(3), that the court is

20

effectively providing an injunction in a case like this,

21

where -- where an action violates the statute.

22

a plan provision which had a very detrimental effect on

23

people was not disclosed to them, and so the effect of

24

the statute is to make that unfavorable provision

25

ineffective.

And so -Alderson Reporting Company

And here

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if the SPD is part

2

of the plan, then where does the "likely harm" standard

3

come from?

4

MR. BRUCE:

I think, as we've said in our

5

brief, we think that the likely harm, possible

6

prejudice, and the material conflict that -- that is

7

used in the Third Circuit in Burstein, we think that all

8

of those standards are very similar, that they are

really looking at whether it -­

No, but why is there any

requirement whatsoever, other than the fact that it's in

14

written document, then -- the previously executed

written document, then you get the benefits under the

harm or reliance or anything else, right?

18

If the SPD is the plan and the SPD says you

It doesn't matter whether there's likely

MR. BRUCE:

Well, I think, Justice Alito, we

19

see this more as a nondisclosure issue, that the

20

unfavorable provisions in the plan were not disclosed,

21

and that the effect of the statute is to make those

22

unfavorable plan provisions ineffective.

23

the statute refers to, for example, material

24

modifications and being sufficiently comprehensive and

25

reasonably apprising, that there are enough
Alderson Reporting Company

But because

Official - Subject to Final Review

qualifications in there where the court can look and

2

see, is this really -- was this conflict, was it really

3

about something that was significant to people that

4

might have an impact on their decision making and

5

whether the terms of their employment are satisfactory,

6

whether they might want to seek another job, they might

7

just go into the office and say:

We need more benefits.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

9

it's a very tough argument to say -- to make a

10

nondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is

11

part of the plan, because the whole point of a summary

12

is not to disclose everything.

13

everything, it wouldn't be a summary.

14

claim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems

15

to me that's in tension with the idea that it's not

16

supposed to be just a repetition of the plan.

17

MR. BRUCE:

If it disclosed
And if you can

Our position is that the SPD is

18

one of the documents or instruments governing the plan.

19

And by statute it's required to have certain -- to meet

20

certain requirements, and therefore it becomes a

21

document governing the plan.

22

Mr. Olson, it is referred to as a document in section

23

1024(a)(6) of the statute, and of course this Court has

24

repeatedly referred to it as a plan document and to

25

"plan documents" plural.

It is -- in response to

So, what --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's -- I think

2

the brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it

3

governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the

4

participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were

5

more favorable and the summary would show fewer

6

benefits, that the summary would then govern.

7

MR. BRUCE:

I think the -- the

8

favorable/unfavorable is that the way -- the way I see

9

it is that an unfavorable plan term, when you look at

10

Curtiss-Wright, an unfavorable plan term must be validly

11

adopted and it must be disclosed in accordance with

12

ERISA in order to be effective.

13

And so, in the Frommert v. Conkright case,

14

that was specifically what the Second Circuit held, was

15

that the summary plan description did not disclose the

16

phantom offset, and therefore the phantom offset was

17

ineffective.

18

disclose the wear-away provisions.

19

expectation is that if they are under a pension plan and

20

they are continuing to work, that they are continuing to

21

earn pension benefits.

22

apprising them that there were unfavorable provisions in

23

the plan, which were validly adopted, but which were

24

secret as far as they were concerned.

25

Here the summary plan description did not

I

If it -- if

The -- the Congress in ERISA is

7

on losses of benefits, and there is a specific provision

8

in the regulations and in the statute about disclosing

9

all the circumstances that can result in a loss of

So the focus is

10

benefits.

So there was a plan provision here which

11

caused the loss of benefits that was never disclosed to

12

people.

13

people knew, well, the plan document may have a

14

wear-away provision, and the SPD doesn't mention it and

15

therefore there is no wear-away.

And it was -- there was no baseline where

They didn't know what wear-away was.

16

They

17

don't know what wear-away is today, because it has never

18

been disclosed to them that there's a way to -- to rig

19

up a pension plan where you can have a period of years,

20

unbeknownst to you, where you're not earning any an

21

additional benefits.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Are you finished

with that?

MR. BRUCE:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sorry.
If you're finished.

Alderson Reporting Company

As I

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

understand what you have been saying and written, you

2

don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract?

mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan

4

and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it

5

according to terms.

6

I

That's one view.

But if you took that view, you get into

7

problems such as were mentioned.

The employer would

8

write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable

9

contract.

Nobody would understand it.

You'd have to

10

worry about the time when it was less favorable than the

11

written document.

12

long as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract.

13

So call it a plan if you want, as

Now, there's a provision that deals with it,

14

saying just what you said in response to Justice Alito.

15

And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that

16

provision govern?

17

1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of

18

accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice

19

in a manner calculated to be understood by the average

20

plan participant.

21

I take it there's a provision,

So I would have thought, I read that, I get

22

what you've said in your brief.

The summary was

23

inadequate.

24

therefore, according to this particular provision, those

25

provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void.

It wouldn't have been understood, and,

The district court found a

we only have two choices.

trust context?

3

MR. BRUCE:

Well, one -- one of this Court's

4

very first ERISA cases was Teamsters v. Daniel, in which

5

the Securities and Exchange Commission had considered

6

pension plans to be a security.

7

actually involved break-in-service rules, and this Court

8

concluded that whatever protections the securities laws

9

offered, potentially offered, to participants were now

10

And -- and the case

offered in more concrete form under ERISA.

11

But the -- the point that I want to get back

12

to on reliance is that my reading of this Court's

13

decision in Bridge and in Lyng v. Payne is that this

14

Court does not look for the closest analogy to a

15

statutory provision.

16

Congress do in enacting this statutory provision?

17

The question is:

JUSTICE ALITO:

What did

Could I ask you this:

20

21

who has the burden, on the issue of likely harm?

What would "likely harm" mean in that

context?

The person was likely to have left the

"Likely harm" can include

that the -- that if the person knew about the provision,

2

they might have asked for the provision to be changed.

3

They might have asked for a different compensation

5

personal kind of self-help steps to protect themselves

6

so that they might have -- have, you know, decided to

They might have asked -- they might have taken

There's both the -- the steps that you can

take in relation to your employment and the steps that

12

you can take on a personal basis.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could they here have

14

gone -- could they also have said to the company:

15

why are you doing this?

16

going to lose money.

17

if interest rates rise, you'll lose money.

18

risk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make

19

sure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A,

20

and then if there's more on Plan B, add it in, and we'll

21

risk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.

If interest rates fall, we're

So we're

So they could -- they might

have talked the company into it.
MR. BRUCE:

Well, the district court found

that there was a real prospect of employee backlash if

2

the employees knew about these benefit reductions.

3

well-established in behavioral economics that people are

4

very averse to losses.

5

the regulations are requiring the loss to be disclosed,

6

it isn't going out on a limb to say that there's going

7

to be a reaction to that.

It's

So if a -- if the statute and

reaction to that, and they had examples from the press

10

of with Deloitte & Touche had had a similar situation

11

where they had to roll back the cash balance changes

12

because employees were so upset.

13

I think, in response to Justice Alito's

14

question, the -- I don't think that the individual has

15

to -- that if the individual has to prove possible

16

prejudice, then I think that, as -- as our district

becomes very close to actual prejudice.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If an administrator -- if an

20

requirement in ERISA that it be a summary and that it be

available to a beneficiary?

MR. BRUCE:

I think -- I think that that's

So it becomes -- it becomes more difficult in

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, doesn't that put

that situation or for the plan sponsor.

If you issue a

succinct SPD, you risk misleading the recipients as to

the contents of the plan, and you may have financial

liability.

If, on the other hand, you issue -- you err

14

on the side of issuing an SPD that is comprehensive,

well, the worst that can happen, according to what you

just said, is you can be faced with an injunction to

provide a more concise and comprehensible statement.

MR. BRUCE:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

The pension benefits an employee accrues

compensation for working, just as her wages are.

8

recover them if they are withheld without any

she is entitled to recover the wages that were promised

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you

14

view this as essentially a contract case, as that just

15

suggested, or instead a trust case?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

We view it as basically a

17

contract case.

18

contractually -- contractually guaranteed benefits,

19

those under the plan.

20

here, in this case the district court found that the SPD

21

basically promised, represented to employees, that after

22

the conversion they would receive pension benefits in

23

the form of A plus B, the old benefits plus the new

24

benefits, accruing right away.

In Firestone, the Court referred to

If this is a contract case,

MR. KNEEDLER:

In this sense:

If the -- if

the SPD contains these sorts of representations such

16

that the employee could reasonably be expected to rely

upon them in defining her benefits, then that controls.

something different from what the underlying plan says.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we have a statute here

that -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial

difference?

that -- I think it really gets at materiality, whether

Mr. Kneedler, I -- I think

it's a hard question here as to whether to think of this

as more like a contract dispute or more like a -- a

trust issue.

14

If we were to look at it as a trust issue,

15

what would be the result of that?

16

would we use?

I think it would be -- I

think it would be the same thing where you -- where you

MR. OLSON:

I -- I don't think that the -­

12

the notice that was involved was referring to the SPD.

13

The SPD, to the extent that it violates ERISA, there is

14

a remedy that still exists; Congress hasn't changed.

15

It's in (a)(3).

16

can seek an injunction.

17

It must be an equitable remedy.

You

And to the extent the Court is concerned

18

that that's an empty remedy, that that's not a

19

sufficient remedy, that's what Congress decided; and we

20

referred in footnote 3 of our reply brief of a number of

21

cases that -- that circuit courts have handled

22

demonstrating detrimental reliance and providing for

23

remedies.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but I still have the

same question Justice Scalia had, which is -- which is

why didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they

2

didn't have -- their claim, the notice wasn't good, and

3

if the notice wasn't good, then -- the plan didn't

4

change, and if the plan didn't change, they should have

5

gotten the money.

6

Why didn't it -- why?

MR. OLSON:

That provision doesn't apply to

7

the SPD, and they did not bring that case.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. OLSON:

I think it's a different type of

notice that -- under that provision.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

I thought it says -­
Well, there was a -- there

was notice, wasn't there?

MR. OLSON:

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

Why doesn't it apply to the

Isn't that a notice?

12

I don't

There was a notice.
And is the claim based on

that, or is it based on the SPD?

19

MR. OLSON:

The claim is based upon the SPD,

20

and the district court decided that the SPD had amended

21

the plan.

22

provides.

23

And that's inconsistent with what the statute

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Olson, on your view of

showing detrimental reliance, I take it you would

require each employee to come forward and say yes, I

2

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And trust law -­
And doesn't that really

misunderstand the realities of the workplace?

Very few

5

people read their SPDs, but you only need one person to

6

read the SPD to come in and say, by the way, folks,

7

21,000 of us are not getting our retirement benefits for

8

the next few years.

9

the workplace is going to know about that.

And within a day, every employee in
So doesn't

10

this give an incredible windfall to your client, Cigna,

11

or to other companies that commit this kind of

12

intentional misconduct if you hold them to this

13

detrimental reliance standard?

14

MR. OLSON:

The -- I refer to what

15

Justice Kennedy was referring to.

we're talking about trust law, we're talking about the

requirement of a loss.

19

aware of it and taken some steps in connection with it.

And that's the evidence that would have to be

that under (a)(3) equity requires detrimental reliance.
