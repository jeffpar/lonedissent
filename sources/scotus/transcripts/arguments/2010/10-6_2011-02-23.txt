Mr. Dunnegan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNNEGAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

8

MR. DUNNEGAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The standard for the state of mind element

11
12

for a claim for inducing patent infringement should be:

13

Did the accused inducer have a purpose to induce a third

14

party to engage in acts that the accused inducer knew

15

infringed the patent?

16

purposeful, culpable test.

That's what I'll call the

The Federal Circuit applied a standard of

17
18

whether Pentalpha was deliberately indifferent to a

19

known risk that a patent may exist.

20

Circuit's deliberate indifference test was not a willful

21

blindness test.

22

both an awareness of a high probability that a patent

23

would exist and a deliberate effort to avoid learning

24

the truth.

25

The Federal

Willful blindness would have required

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's okay, as far as

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you're concerned?

2

your first test?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

3
4

Your Honor, deliberate

indifference would not fall -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

5
6

You would consider that comes within

Would not, but willful

blindness would?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

7

No, Your Honor.

Willful

8

blindness would not fall within our purposeful, culpable

9

test.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

wouldn't be enough?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

12
13

So even willful blindness

Willful blindness in not a

purpose, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

You said that the

15

particular patent -- the defendant would have to know

16

that the device infringed the particular patent.

17

think that would be a standard that would be impossible

18

to meet.

19

whatever it was, '312.

We have to know if it was patent number,

MR. DUNNEGAN:

20

I

Well, you wouldn't have to

21

know the patent number, Your Honor, but what you would

22

have to know is that your -- the product which you are

23

inducing a third party to make, use, or sell would be

24

within the scope of a -- of the claims of a particular

25

patent.

If you don't know that, then you're
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

literally -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

But you can keep yourself

3

ignorant of it.

I mean, for example, you pointed out

4

that the -- that the device that was copied was

5

purchased in Hong Kong, so it didn't have any marking,

6

but the same Pentalpha could have bought the device in

7

Montgomery Ward, looked to see if it had a patent

8

marking; didn't do that.
MR. DUNNEGAN:

9

It didn't do that, Your

10

Honor.

What it did was better.

It hired a United

11

States patent attorney to conduct a search to see if

12

there was any patent which was infringed.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But didn't tell that

14

patent attorney that they had reverse-engineered a

15

particular product.

16

device copied the SEB fryer, isn't it 99 and 44/100ths

17

percent sure that the attorney then would have found

18

this patent?

19

If the attorney had been told this

MR. DUNNEGAN:

We don't know, Your Honor.

20

We don't know why the patent search failed.

21

have failed for a number of reasons.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It could

But I didn't ask you

23

about this patent search.

I said if they had told the

24

patent attorney we have copied a particular fryer, it's

25

SEB's fryer, now find out if it infringed any patent -­
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do you think an attorney would not have found the SEB

2

patent?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

3
4

wouldn't have.

5

have.

6

Your Honor.

7

It's possible that he

Maybe it's more probable that he would

There's just no evidence on that in the record,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why -- why wouldn't

8

you tell him?

If you're -- if you're honestly

9

interested in finding out whether there is a patent that

10

you're infringing, why wouldn't you tell me the reason

11

we're concerned is that we have reverse-engineered this

12

from somebody else's product?

13

has a patent on any of this stuff that we've

14

reverse-engineered.

15

Just check to see if SEB

That's what I would have done.

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Your Honor, maybe that's what

16

you would have done.

17

done, but there's no -- but the standard of that

18

business -- what they had done in the past was to give

19

their design drawings to the patent attorney and say

20

objectively check these design drawings.

21

was not to notify the attorney.

22
23

Maybe that's what I would have

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Their practice

Was their practice to

reverse-engineer from other people's products?

24

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Yes -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I can understand

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

when you have a new product of your own; of course, you

2

just give it to an attorney.

3

reverse-engineered, not to tell them that it was

4

reversed-engineered seems to me really trying to keep

5

yourself in the dark.

6

attorney is a piece of paper that he can show to

7

Montgomery Ward that, yes, this product is not -- as it

8

turns out, Montgomery Ward did accept it and got hit

9

with liability for infringing a patent.

But when you have

What you want to get from the

I -- I find

10

that really incredible that, in an honest attempt to

11

find whether there was any patent infringement going on,

12

you wouldn't even tell the patent attorney that you've

13

reverse-engineered somebody else's product.

14

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Your Honor, looking back at

15

this in hindsight, there's -- there's no question that

16

if they had to do it again, they would have taken the

17

additional step.

18

But -­

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. DUNNEGAN:

No, they wouldn't.
No -- well, from an objective

21

perspective, Your Honor, if you're giving the design to

22

the -- to the attorney and you're saying do a complete

23

search, it seems to me that that's the antithesis of

24

being willful blind, because you're hiring a specialist

25

to go out and look for the answer for you.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

gold standard was not met, but the gold standard would

2

rarely be met in any of these cases.
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

But your position is that

4

even willful blindness is not enough.

5

actual knowledge that -- that the item is patented,

6

right?

7

MR. DUNNEGAN:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

You have to have

That is correct, Your Honor.
So if the attorney had

called up your client and said, I have an answer for

10

you, and the client said, well, you know what, on second

11

thought, I really don't want to know, because if I -- if

12

I have actual knowledge, that may put me in a box; so

13

forget about it.

Then there's no liability.

MR. DUNNEGAN:

14

Well, I would disagree in

15

that situation, because most probably the knowledge of

16

the attorney in that situation, because he has been

17

hired by the client, would be imputed to the client.

18

I could see a different result in the hypothetical that

19

you posited.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

So

Why would we -- wouldn't

21

the rule that you're setting forth, willful blindness

22

not being a part of it, mean that nobody would ever get

23

a patent search, because what would be the inducement to

24

do that?

25

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Well, Your Honor, right now,
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under -- under the Seagate case in the Federal Circuit,

2

there is no inducement to go get a patent search.

3

the Seagate decision, if a party -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Under

No, but you're not

5

presumed to copy other people's items, which is the

6

difference.

7

Is there -- let me just ask you something.

8

Assuming we were to find the willful blindness test to

9

actual knowledge, the facts of your case, the fact that

10

they did not give the name of the product that they

11

copied to their patent attorney, is that just, as a

12

matter of law, willful blindness?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

13

No, Your Honor, I don't think

14

that is willful blindness as a matter of law.

15

blindness under the -- under the Santos standard has two

16

distinct elements.

17

probability that there would have been a patent on that

18

particular product.

One would be that there's a high

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

Willful

Do patents -- are

20

patents -- can you do a patent search on the basis of

21

the name of the holder?

22

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Yes, you can, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the product that

24

they copied, did it have the name of the holder of the

25

patent?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what is the

3

likelihood that if they had actually given the attorney

4

the name of the product, that he would not have found

5

the patent?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

6

We don't know for sure, but

7

the probability would be greater than 50 percent, Your

8

Honor.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think it would be

10

probably 90 percent, assuming -- because there's always

11

errors in searches.

12

So -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But didn't we take this

13

case to determine whether or not deliberate indifference

14

is the standard?

15

think an opinion for this Court has ever sustained.

16

Santos was a judgment -- was not a majority opinion.

17

That's just a subset of knowledge.

18

I mean, willful blindness -- I don't

If we leave that out from it, isn't the

19

dichotomy that you present to us the difference between

20

deliberate indifference and knowledge or -­

21

MR. DUNNEGAN:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

Purpose.
-- or purposeful, culpable

expression, the -- the Grokster standard?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

Yes.

The -- well, I think to

answer the question presented in a cert petition, you
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

really need to determine what the standard is.

2

think we can also decide that it should not be -- or we

3

can agree that it should not be a deliberate

4

indifference to a known risk that a patent exists,

5

because that would be met in virtually every situation

6

where there was not actual knowledge of a patent.
JUSTICE ALITO:

7

Now, I

When I look at the language

8

of the statute, I see no scienter requirement

9

whatsoever.

Whoever actively induces infringement of

10

the patent -- infringement is strict liability.

11

you actively induce somebody to engage in conduct

12

constituting infringement, you're -- you're liable as an

13

inducer.
MR. DUNNEGAN:

14

So if

Let me explain to you why

15

your -- why the language of the statute should not

16

support the interpretation which Your Honor just gave.
Let's begin with the word "induces."

17
18

"Induces" connotes some degree of intent, arguably.

19

Mr. Cruz agrees with that at page 20 of his brief.

20

you put the word "actively" in front of the word

21

"induces," then you have a heightened intent standard -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

22
23
24
25

If

You have intent, but intent

to do what?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

Exactly, Your Honor.

That

brings you to the word "infringement" in the statute.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, I think it's critical that (b) uses the word

2

"infringement."

3

anyone who actively induces the making, using, selling

4

of a patent device is an infringer.
JUSTICE ALITO:

5
6

make?

7

infringement.

What difference does that

Because making, using, and selling equals

MR. DUNNEGAN:

8
9

It does not go back to (a) and say

Your Honor.

Because those are the acts,

If Congress's intent had been to say we

10

only want to induce acts, it would seem to me the

11

clearest way they could say that is to say "making,

12

using, or selling."

13

which was inducing the actual infringement of a patent,

14

as opposed to the acts which constitute the

15

infringement, then they use the word "infringement."

16

If they wanted to create a standard

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't see that.

And

17

not only that, I don't understand why the scienter

18

requirement for inducing should be higher than the

19

scienter requirement for a direct infringement.

20

the standard rule for aiding and abetting that the aider

21

and abetter -- if (b) is an aiding and abetting

22

provision, as one of the congressional reports said, the

23

-- the scienter for aiding and abetting is the scienter

24

of the underlying offense?

25

is a strict liability offense, then the inducement

Isn't

So if the underlying offense

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should be strict liability as well.
MR. DUNNEGAN:

2

That's not necessarily clear,

3

Your Honor.

4

there's very little case law dealing with strict

5

liability offense and inducements of those.

6

been able to identify one Sixth Circuit case from 1989

7

which deals with the issue, and in that case, it holds

8

that there's actually a purpose to -- a purpose to cause

9

the underlying crime or violation, not necessarily

10

When you look at 18 U.S.C. section 2,

We have

strict liability, not strict liability.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. DUNNEGAN:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. DUNNEGAN:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your -­

I -­
I'm sorry.

No, please, Your Honor.
Is your position

16

when you're -- when you're talking about willful

17

blindness or purpose, whatever, is that with respect to

18

a particular patent, or is it with respect to

19

infringement of a patent?

20

I don't think it's true with deep fryers,

21

but in some areas, you almost always know you're going

22

to hit something, that given the nature of the industry,

23

you're going to infringe something.

24
25

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Is that enough?

If there is an area -- for

example, semiconductors, where some amici have stated
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there's -- there's 420,000 patents dealing with

2

semiconductors.

3

you do virtually anything, and especially if you copy,

4

you're going to hit a semiconductor patent owned by

5

somebody, I think that, in that rare situation,

6

knowledge that you're infringing someone's intellectual

7

property rights should probably be enough of a -- of a

8

directed intent.

9

inferring a purpose.

And you know that, and you know that if

If you -- that would be the basis for

10

But here, we have to -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's -- I

12

mean, I understand you're in the deep fryer industry,

13

but that standard would bring the semiconductor industry

14

to a halt.

15

MR. DUNNEGAN:

No.

No, Your Honor.

If you

16

copied a semiconductor and you knew that there were

17

420,000 patents that were unexpired out there, that

18

would make it -- if you didn't do your -- your

19

diligence, perhaps -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think the -- the

21

problem is, even if you do do your diligence, given the

22

way patents are these days, if there are 420,000, you're

23

never going to know with any degree of comfort that

24

you're not going to infringe something.

25

MR. DUNNEGAN:

That is very, very true, Your
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor.

And even in the -- in the deep-fryer industry,

2

it is going to be different, because there's very few --

3

I mean, compared to semiconductors -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

4
5

Well, we're not going to

adopt a special rule for the deep-fryer industry.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. DUNNEGAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Agreed.
Especially -­
Completely agreed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

But we might decide

11

that it's more important to consider what's going to

12

happen to the semiconductor industry in articulating our

13

standard than what's going to happen to the deep-fryer

14

industry.
MR. DUNNEGAN:

15
16

That's exactly correct, Your

Honor.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. DUNNEGAN:

That's exactly correct.

And

19

on balance -- I think there's one point that I should

20

make sooner rather than later, and it's is the standard

21

that I'm -- the standard that we are proposing is not

22

unique to us.

23

Grokster developed.

24

blindness, we believe that the standard -- the balance

25

was already struck, and it was struck in favor of

eliminating a willful blindness standard.

I'd like to -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dunnegan, suppose I

disagree with you on that, and suppose I think that

5

actual knowledge of a patent or willful blindness as to

6

whether a patent exists is the right standard.

7

reasonable jury have found that in this case?

8
9

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Could a

We don't think that a

reasonable jury could have found willful blindness

10

because, first of all, there wasn't a high probability

11

that a patent would be found.

12

that there was active -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Second, we do not think

A reasonable jury couldn't

14

have looked at the facts that Justice Ginsburg

15

suggested -- you know, you do not tell the lawyer that

16

you, in fact, have copied the product and say that's -­

17

a reasonable jury -- that's willful blindness.

18

MR. DUNNEGAN:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

19

because what we have done in that situation was, first,

20

we have done more than the law required.

21

get a patent.

22

drawings and tell him to do his work.

23

We went out to

We gave the lawyer our actual patent

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you really wanted

24

to know, wouldn't you have gone into Montgomery Ward and

25

bought one of the fryers and turned it around to see if
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

it had a patent number on it?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

Your Honor, we have so many

3

products that you couldn't practically expect the

4

company to do that, I don't think.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Listen, the -- the reason

6

you got the opinion from the lawyer was -- was not to

7

make sure that there were no patents.

8

that opinion to Montgomery Ward.

10

MR. DUNNEGAN:

It was to show

But your -- your -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As a practical matter, you

11

needed an opinion from a lawyer, because otherwise,

12

Montgomery Ward was not going to sell this stuff.

13

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Your Honor, I take issue with

14

you for the following reason:

15

any intention on the part of our client to -- to

16

infringe a patent at all, because if it knew about the

17

patent, it could have designed around it if it knew what

18

it was doing.

19

getting Montgomery Ward or Sunbeam or Fingerhut in

20

trouble for patenting infringement.

21

know what patents are out there.

22

I don't think there was

There's no benefit to our client of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We really want to

But isn't -- isn't it

23

true that Sunbeam was the party that asked for the

24

patent search?

25

MR. DUNNEGAN:

I don't believe that's in the
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

record, Your Honor.

2

Sunbeam was given a copy of the patent search, but

3

Mr. Sham testified -- and I believe this is about at

4

page 50 of the joint appendix -- that the purpose of the

5

search was to find out whether or not there was an

6

infringement of any patent through this deep fryer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7
8

MR. DUNNEGAN:

13

Not that I'm aware of, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11
12

And there's nothing in

the record that says who -- who asked Pentalpha -­

9
10

I believe the record shows that

-- to get -- to get a

letter?
JUSTICE ALITO:

If this is not willful

14

blindness, I don't know what willful blindness is.

15

maybe you can explain what more would have been required

16

to permit a reasonable jury to find willful blindness.

17

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Okay.

Now,

I think you'd need two

18

things, Your Honor.

19

evidence that they were going to bump into a patent if

20

they -- if they proceeded.

21

probability of finding a patent?

22

The first that you would need is

Is there the high

Now, if you -- if you just consciously avoid

23

knowledge in the absence of a high probability, that's

24

not willful blindness.

25

That's not even culpable.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your client -- I don't

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

know whether you're using your time most effectively by

2

arguing this point, but your client thought that making

3

a deep fryer that wouldn't burn people's hands if they

4

touched it would be profitable, because there wasn't a

5

lot of competition in that market.

18

Whether it is (b) or (c), these are just two means of -­

of doing a contributory infringement, and the

knowledge/willful blindness standard, once we've said it

21

applies to (c), it applies to (b) as well?

22

Because in Aro II we said that the

Why shouldn't we just say it's the same?

MR. DUNNEGAN:

The reason that you shouldn't

23

take the standard from (c) is because (c) deals with

from whether they should have different standards as to

But that's a different thing

MR. DUNNEGAN:

14

Well, when you say there's

15

different standards, the sale of an -- of a staple

article under (b) in itself with a proper state of mind

can be an inducement.

18

with certain additional conditions can be a violation of

essentially the same for the sale of components, and it

wouldn't make any sense to raise it for (b) because all

copyrighted works.

15

though they knew it; it wasn't the basis for liability.

16

That was collateral damage even

In Grokster, the basis for liability was

17

even though the defendant knew that there were going to

be some infringements, it couldn't be liable for

contributory copyright infringement, the equivalent of

271(c), because there was substantial noninfringing uses

for the Grokster software.

to be found liable because the defendants had a -- a

holding on what had to be demonstrated, the Court

concluded that that word knowing effectively modified

both the knowledge that the nonstaple article had no

modifying everything that follows it in 271(c).

It is in the red brief,

the Respondent's brief, page 26, toward the bottom it

10

says if you find, I have a problem that I do not know

11

that they preserved this objection, but let's talk about

12

what the standard ought to be.

13

if you find that the someone has directly infringed a

14

patent and that the defendants knew or should have known

15

that its actions would induce direct infringement.

16

this means to me that in order to be liable for an

17

inducement you can be liable if you knew or should have

18

known.

19

It seems to me that this is the important point in the

20

case because if you say should have known, then you have

21

a standard that is less than intentional for inducers.

22

And that means that every supplier, every business

23

person that takes a product from a manufacturer has the

24

duty to inquire and to find out if there is a patent.

25

And it is a standard that is less than intentional and

of that language is, is to allow constructive knowledge.

a necessary interpretation of (b), especially as we are

informed through (c) as to what (b) might mean.

is also the language I read before that is part of the

can be presumed to have only listened to one snippet of

point.

But I am interested in what the standard ought

the language knew or should have known, that if there is

not an actual knowledge requirement, which in my

judgment is nowhere in the statute, then you have to

the words "actively induced" are meant to be something

10

greater than knowing, not something less than knowing.

11

Because otherwise, you're going to hold Aluminum Company

12

of America, if that still exists, liable when it makes

13

these aluminum sheets, because somebody uses an aluminum

14

sheet apparently, et cetera.

You see the problem.

It is quite different when you make this

15
16

weird kabuki-looking thing that only has one use,

17

and they -- and that's why it should be -- it should be

18

harder to hold that person to contributory infringement,

19

not easier.
Now, that's their argument.

20
21
22

What do you

say.
MR. CRUZ:

Justice Breyer, that -- that may

23

be a reasonable policy argument.

However, that is also

24

a reasonable policy argument for modifying A, because

25

right now, the aluminum company is liable under strict
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

liability for direct infringement today.
JUSTICE BREYER:

2

I'd like to get, really, an

3

answer from you on Justice Kennedy's question, because

4

at the moment I am not worried about your case.

5

course, are.

You, of

I understand that.
But the -- I am worried about Alcoa or the

6
7

little backyard maker of clay pots, or -- I mean,

8

millions and millions of people make things that are

9

used in millions and millions of ways.

And I am worried

10

about what kind of burden we are supposed to impose on

11

them.
I see three candidates.

12

One is, you're

13

liable if you should have known.

14

if you consciously disregarded a -- a risk, a known

15

risk; that is sort of like a -- you know, the Model

16

Penal Code, sort of.

And third is willful blindness.

Is there a fourth?

17

Two is, you're liable

And if there is not,

18

what do you choose among those three?

19

choose.

20

No, not what you

What should we choose?
MR. CRUZ:

We have suggested three possible

21

standards to be the rule in this case.

22

Court could choose to adopt the standard that was

23

adopted in Grokster, and we have argued at considerable

24

length that under the standard this Court adopted in

25

Grokster, the plaintiffs -- the defendants, rather,
37
Alderson Reporting Company

The first, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be liable and it would uphold the judgment below.

2

That is the broadest standard the Court could adopt.
A more narrow standard the Court could adopt

is that at a minimum, willful blindness of the patented

5

issue suffices to allow inducement liability.

6

more narrow standard.

9

suggesting.

10
11

That is a

It would cover a much narrower
It would exclude much of the

That is the second way this judgment could

be affirmed and a more narrow rule.
The most narrow rule we have suggested this

12

Court could adopt is in the limited circumstances when a

13

defendant deliberately copies another commercial

14

product, at a minimum, that defendant has an obligation

15

to ascertain if that specific product has protected U.S.

16

intellectual property, that it is a very minor

17

obligation that is triggered only when you take a

18

commercial product on the marketplace, reverse-engineer

19

it, and copy it, because it is a situation that is

20

highly likely to be indicative of bad conduct, to be

21

risking a very substantial infringement of someone

22

else's IP, and in terms of a low-cost avoider, one of

23

the things at footnote 20 of our brief -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

Before you go -­

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you get an opinion from a lawyer, as they did here,

2

saying you're not violating any copyright or any -- any

3

patent?
MR. CRUZ:

4

If they had said three words

5

differently, this would be a very, very different case.

6

If they had simply, in talking to their lawyer, said:

7

We copied SEB.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. CRUZ:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

You have to tell the

searcher that you copied.

10

12

Okay.

Yes.
That is part of your test,

right?
MR. CRUZ:

If you specifically copy a

14

product, you have to look to see if that particular

15

product is protected by IP.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So is that -- is that

17

another standard?

Maybe that is an example of what it

18

is to be willfully blind.

19

you copy something, it could well be patented, and you

20

do not tell your lawyer, go look up this one, that is

willfully blind.

MS. BLATT:

But, Justice Kennedy, the reason

17

in this case why we brought a cause of action for both

direct infringement and active inducing is because the

19

argument of Pentalpha was their conduct was all

20

overseas, and so they weren't covered by 271(a).

21

entire reason for the inducing strategy is they may well

22

prevail in another case on saying, we stole your

property overseas so you can't get us for direct

one of the phrases Giles Rich used in defense of 271.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

So are you saying that the

3

standard of knowledge would be the same for direct

infringement as for active inducement?
MR. CRUZ:

5

I think there is a reasonable

statutory argument to be made that it is the same,

there is certainly a reasonable statutory argument.

opposite position:

standard for him than actual knowledge.

My understanding of Petitioner's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Kennedy, that they are effectively requiring

2

actual knowledge, that that's what their urging is.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

Why aren't you both wrong,

4

that Grokster didn't deal with the question that we are

5

dealing with, which was knowledge of a patent or

6

knowledge of a copyright, that Grokster dealt with

7

whether there was specific intent or whether there

8

needed to be specific intent to encourage infringing

9

acts.

10

That is what Grokster was about, an entirely

separate question.
MR. CRUZ:

11

Let me answer both your question,

12

Justice Kagan, and the Chief Justice's question

13

together.
Grokster used language about purposeful

14
15

culpable conduct, but it went further.

It specified how

16

you ascertain whether that standard is met, and it said

17

as shown by other affirmative acts to encourage

18

inducement.

Grokster made was, we do not know what copyrights are

going to be violated.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

points out that that argument is a lot less plausible in

copyright than it is in -- in patents.

suggestion that we simply take Grokster wholesale and

apply it to this situation.

Justice Scalia.

I am not advocating this Court do so.

made the choice to directly and deliberately violate the

copyrights and Grokster simply provided the tool to do

so.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Would you say, even though

15

you -- I think you disagree with this in this case,

16

would you say that there is a reasonable argument in our

17

precedent for saying that the standard of knowledge

18

under (b) should be greater than reckless disregard?
MR. CRUZ:

19

I do not believe there is in the

20

precedent.

For one thing, reckless disregard is the

21

standard now.

22

standard right now for enhanced damages and attorney's

23

fees; and if it were the case that every violation of

24

271(b) required willfulness or recklessness, it would

25

also mean that every violation would qualify for

Willfulness and recklessness are the

44
Alderson Reporting Company

enhanced damages or attorney's fees.

2

that's consistent with the statutory standard.

not the language Congress adopted.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

I don't think

All right.

That's

Would you say

5

that there is substantial authority for the proposition

that it should -- the state of mind should be greater

than "should have known"?

is.

You know, I do not believe there

Particularly how "should have known" was used in

If you look at -­
They're dealing with a

is right or wrong.

the right one?

Alderson Reporting Company

Is that standard

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. CRUZ:

I agree the Federal Circuit had

2

that language.

I would not suggest that standard was

3

the wrong standard, but what I would say, what the

4

Federal Circuit in fact did is it applied willful

5

blindness.

6

look at how it in fact interpreted it, although it used

7

the deliberate indifference language, which I will

8

concede was somewhat confusing in its reasoning.

9

look at it, it framed it as whether Pentalpha had

If you look at the cases it cited, if you

If you

10

constructive knowledge of the patent, and it then cited

11

willful blindness cases from other circuits that focused

12

it on actively disregarding a known risk and deliberate

13

avoidance and consciously avoided knowledge.

14

that is willful blindness knowledge.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

indeed we have suggested the central issue, the question

before this Court is, is there a requirement of actual

there is no reasonable argument from the statutory

knowledge that you have to know the specific patent by

I am going to suggest it is a

binary choice.

It is either actual specific knowledge

of the patent, or it is some form of "should have known"

that allows constructive knowledge.

the jury was more than sufficient under any of these

standards.

we made, there was a finding of direct infringement.

18

That finding of direct infringement is also supported by

19

the damage award and that is an alternative ground to

remand it.

21

focuses on the same differential that the Federal

22

Circuit did between the language of the jury charge and

the language of the verdict form, but the only evidence

the jury had of the number of units sold by anybody was

provides, this is worth reading, I believe.

16

liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found,

17

it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing

liability, excuse me, fault, but from inferring a

showing what that objective was.

Is there purposeful, culpable

of the patent?

MR. DUNNEGAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you want actual knowledge

Yes, Your Honor.
And that is the issue you

preserved with your objection?

MR. DUNNEGAN:

11

other issues beyond that.

12

charge by objecting at 135A of the joint appendix and we

13

objected to the judgment as a matter of law motion by

14

making it and saying specifically there is no evidence

15

here that there was actual knowledge of the patent

16

before April 9th of 1998.

17

Not precisely.

We preserved

We preserved both the jury

Now -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And after that date you

18

admit you -- because you continued to sell the product

19

to the retailers?

20

MR. DUNNEGAN:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

Yes, Your Honor.
So after Sunbeam sued,

then you are actively inducing infringement?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

No, Your Honor.

At that

24

point we have actual knowledge of the patent and the

25

analysis has to go to what was our purpose.
54
Alderson Reporting Company

For the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bulk of that period of time, we had a legal opinion from

2

a very competent New York City lawyer stating that we

3

did not infringe.

4

point I was trying to make is the jury never evaluated

5

any standard higher than new or -­

And the jury, I guess the second

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

I thought that opinion

7

was after the first finding of infringement, that you

8

redesigned the product and that, the evidence you got

9

dealt with the redesigned products.
MR. DUNNEGAN:

10
11

correct, Your Honor.

I believe your timing is

The -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

But after just

13

originally, Sunbeam is suing for infringement.

14

notifies Pentalpha.

15

continuing to make sales.

16

actively inducing infringement.

At that point, Pentalpha is

MR. DUNNEGAN:

17

Sunbeam

Is it infringing?

Is it

That is a question of fact,

18

Your Honor.

The jury resolved it against us, but the

19

point I was trying to make is that for some period of

20

time after that we had a legal opinion saying we did not

21

infringe and we believe that legal opinion from the New

22

York City attorney would prevent or should prevent, as a

23

matter of fact, a finding of purposeful, culpable

24

conduct.

25

was -­

Now, the second standard I wanted to address

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You admitted there was

2

purposeful, culpable conduct when you did not, when you

3

had the original design and that was, and you were sued

4

for actively inducing infringement of that design, by

5

that design.
MR. DUNNEGAN:

6
7

We would

never concede that we were purposefully -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9

No, Your Honor.

But you think a jury

could have found that from the facts?
MR. DUNNEGAN:

10

Yes.

We are not seeking

11

judgment as a matter of law for any claims that arose

12

after April of 1998 when we had actual knowledge of the

13

patent, only before we had actual knowledge of the

14

patent are we seeking judgement as a matter of law.

15

Now, going to the issue of whether willful blindness

16

could be found by the failure of someone to tell the

17

patent attorney that there was a copying -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

I am sorry.

19

doing that?

20

have to have actual knowledge of the patent.

Why are you

I thought that you came in arguing that you

21

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

By number, and that was

23

the conversation we had earlier, and that the patent

24

covered the scope of your invention.

25

MR. DUNNEGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.
56

Alderson Reporting Company

That's our

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

primary argument, but if the court were to adopt willful

2

blindness as being enough, then I would question whether

3

or not simply not telling the patent attorney what

4

references were used or even which ones were copied

5

would be enough.

6

has taken an effort to find out what the truth is and it

7

simply failed to meet the gold standard in meeting that

8

obligation.
