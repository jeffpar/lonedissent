ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. HORAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-7073

9
10

MR. HORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The statutory interpretation question here

12

is what laws trigger section 924(c)(1)(A)'s "except"

13

clause.

14

meaning and effect to every word and phrase of section

15

924(c)(1)(A) and that follows this Court's recent

16

holdings regarding the broad scope of the phrase "any

17

other provision of law."

18

Mr. Gould offers an interpretation that gives

The government, on the other hand, advocates

19

a narrow construction that is not supported by the text

20

and defends it primarily on the basis that section

21

924(c) supposedly should always produce the most severe

22

mandatory minimum sentence for every defendant.

23

Respectfully, the government's

24

interpretation is incorrect.

Its reading gives no

25

practical effect to the phrase "any other provision of
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law," and the government has not cited and has yet to

2

even attempt to distinguish this Court's recent

3

interpretation of the very same phrase, "any other

4

provision of law," in Republic of Iraq v. Beaty just

5

last year.

6

Unlike the government's, Mr. Gould's

7

interpretation is true to the text; it is true to this

8

Court's holdings; and it's true to Congress's evident

9

purpose in 924(c)(1)(A), and in particular in its

10

"except" clause.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the text of this is

12

so clear, how is it that Mr. Gould and Mr. Abbott

13

propose different interpretations of this provision?

14

MR. HORAN:

Your Honor, as a judicial

15

matter, I would note that I think our interpretations

16

are not that far apart.

17
18

But -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But they are not the same,

are they?

19

MR. HORAN:

They are not.

And our

20

interpretation, we believe, is the closest to the actual

21

text.

22

into the text.

23

Our interpretation requires reading no language
It -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't there -- isn't it -­

24

there is a missing prepositional phrase in this -- in

25

the provision that we are looking at?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It says, "except to the extent that a

2

greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided."

3

what?

4

prepositional phrase.

5

for -- for an offense that's part of the --of the

6

underlying transaction, for a violation of this

7

particular provision or one that's very similar to it.

8

There is just no way of getting around the

9
10
11

For

And all of you have to -- are filling in the
For an offense of conviction,

fact that something has to be read in there.

Something

is implied; isn't that right?
MR. HORAN:

Your Honor, respectfully, I

12

believe under our interpretation, it -- there is -- you

13

do have to understand something to be in there, but we

14

are not actually reading anything into the text.

15

is the reason -- to be sure, the words "any kind of

16

conviction" are not in there.

17

That

However, the most natural reading of the

18

text, without adding anything to it, is that

19

924(c)(1)(A) requires a 5-year -- at least a 5-year

20

minimum sentence, in addition to any sentence for the

21

predicate drug trafficking or violent crime, except to

22

the extent that a greater minimum sentence is provided

23

for the defendant by subsection 924(c) or by any other

24

provision of law.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that means there would

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be no punishment, added punishment, at all for the

2

possession of the gun; that is, you have the -- the

3

possession with intent to distribute, no gun involved,

4

and you get 10 years mandatory minimum for that.

5

automatically would wipe out any add-on for the gun,

6

under your reading.

7

MR. HORAN:

Yes.

That

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

8

And to follow on that, it is true that our

9

interpretation -- we think that the plain text dictates

10

that if the "except" clause is triggered, the lesser

11

mandatory minimum sentence under 924(c)(1)(A) shall not

12

be imposed; that is -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

You keep

14

saying that you're not reading anything into the statute

15

under your interpretation, but you are.

16

limiting the -- the "any other provision of law" to any

17

other provision of law specified in the charging -- in

18

the counts of conviction, correct?

19

MR. HORAN:

20

You are

That is the -- yes, Your Honor.

We are recognizing that limitation.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you -- you said to

22

Justice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but

23

you are.

24

provision of -- of law to refer to counts of conviction

25

at sentencing, correct?

You're reading into it that the other

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. HORAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So why is

3

that read-in logical, meaning it's giving no extra

4

punishment for the possession of a firearm?

5

MR. HORAN:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Which was, I think,

Justice Ginsburg's -­

8
9

Your Honor, two things -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

I think you weren't

finished answering my question.

10

MR. HORAN:

If I may -- and I think then -­

11

I think it will help in answering your question, Justice

12

Sotomayor.

13

say -- the thing I would additionally say, though, is

14

that there is, under the sentencing guidelines, which

15

must be applied even now, as -- to provide a recommended

16

range, there would in each of these instances be a

17

firearm enhancement that enhances the underlying

18

predicate offenses' sentence that the defendant would be

19

facing and also how the -- the district court would

20

work.

23
24
25

The only thing I would

So I believe -­

21
22

That is correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that is not

mandatory?
MR. HORAN:

That is no longer mandatory.

That is correct.
And then with regard to your question,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you're saying that the

3

gun possession can be accounted for by the judge as a

4

matter of discretion using guidelines, but there's no

5

mandatory at all?

6

MR. HORAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is

7

correct.

8

for -- or mandatory additional punishment for the

9

firearm possession.

10

There would no longer be a mandatory sentence

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and I suppose the

11

prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it

12

chooses to bring in a single prosecution.

13

I mean, if it has other -- other

14

enhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for

15

that.

16

one prosecution, you get the break.

17

other enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a

18

separate prosecution, you don't get it.

19

So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in

MR. HORAN:

But if -- if the

Justice Scalia, I think that's

20

correct to an extent.

21

that -- and I think it's a significant one -- is that

22

the "except" clause would most often be triggered in the

23

mine run of cases by the predicate drug trafficking or

24

violent crime that carries with it a greater mandatory

25

minimum sentence.

The -- the main exception to

That is, for double jeopardy
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purposes, the same offense as 924(c).

2

So, in fact, there is a significant

3

constraint on the prosecution, that it cannot bring a

4

separate prosecution for 924(c) and its predicate drug

5

or trafficking -- drug trafficking or violent crime.

6

it's a significant limitation on this -­

7
8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

So

Yes, I understand

what you're saying.

9

MR. HORAN:

Okay.

And Justice Sotomayor, to

10

return to your question, if I could answer it in two

11

parts.

12

did -- we are not reading additional language into it.

13

Our reading is contained within the context and the

14

actual text that -- that is confined to section 924(c).

15

First -- and I didn't mean to overstate, if I

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Explain how, because you

16

just said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory

17

minimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it

18

doesn't affect you at all.

19

count is in a count of conviction at sentencing.

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. HORAN:

It only affects you if the

Yes, Your Honor.

That is

correct.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what in the language

of 924(c) sets forth that limitation?
MR. HORAN:

Your Honor, I would say that it

is the words "is otherwise provided" and the context in
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which any textual reading -­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- but there

3

"otherwise provided by law" could be Federal, State

4

laws.

5

indictment.

6

somehow, but I want to see what the language is that

7

you're relying upon to limit it.

8
9

It could be in the indictment, not in the
You're proposing that we limit this

MR. HORAN:

Your Honor, it is -- first of

all, the statute begins by directing the defendant -- I

10

mean, directing the district court to "any person."

11

they're focusing on the defendant.

12

offense-defining provision, to be sure, of the sentence.

13

That is the

But the -- throughout the text, it also

14

directs the district court to take account of minimum

15

sentences that are provided for other crimes; for

16

instance, primarily the predicate -­

17

So

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In relationship to what?

18

Isn't that the government's argument, which is that you

19

have to say in relationship to something, whether it's

20

the indictment or, as the government would have it, in

21

relationship to the possession or carrying of a firearm?

22

Why isn't that the more natural reading?

23

MR. HORAN:

Your Honor, because that -­

24

because the statute as a whole is essentially

25

instructions to the district court on how to sentence a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant, if at all, for the 924(c)(1)(A) offense.

2

It directs them to, after considering the

3

person in front of them, to impose a sentence of 5 years

4

or less, in addition to the predicate -- any penalty for

5

the -- the predicate drug trafficking or violent crime,

6

except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is

7

otherwise provided.

8
9

The natural reading of that is -- and must
be -- that it is a -- a greater minimum sentence is

10

provided for that defendant; that is, before the

11

particular district court with the particular offenses

12

that he has before him at sentencing.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Don't most crimes of

14

violence and drug trafficking carry more than a 5-year

15

sentence?

16

MR. HORAN:

Many of them do, Your Honor.

17

fact, those that carry a mandatory minimum sentence

18

largely carry -- all carry, in fact, 10 years.

In

19

There are some -- there are some both

20

predicate drug trafficking offenses and predicate

21

violent crimes that carry either no minimum at all or a

22

mandatory minimum of 5 years or less, and so would not

23

trigger the except clause.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So let's suppose somebody

commits a rape and a maiming in the same -- in the same
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

criminal act.

2

let's assume it's his third.

3

crime.

4

know, a three-time violent crime loser.

5

You're saying that the prosecution -- and
It's his third violent

So he would get the enhancement as being, you

You're saying he could get that enhancement

6

and the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he

7

had a gun at the same time.

8

prosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which

9

he will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then

He can get it if the

10

in a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the

11

use of a firearm.

12

right?

Then he gets both enhancements,

13

MR. HORAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That seems -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure that that's

16

right.

17

crime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where

18

the crime is defined as a real offense in the world,

19

with the limitations put on that term by the guidelines.

20

I would think that would be a natural reading, in which

21

case you'd look to the conduct of the person.

22

I think that -- that this may well apply to the

And if the conduct of the person is such

23

that it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind,

natural way.

question, Justice Breyer, in answering Justice Scalia's

11

question, my assumption was that there were, in fact,

12

6

I mean, has there ever been such

Are you aware if any such case ever
happened?
MR. HORAN:

No, I'm -- I'm not aware of

7

8

-- there aren't that many instances of the "except"

9

clause having been actually applied.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there has never been

11

the incentive to do so, until we accept your

12

interpretation.

13

Then there will be means to do so.

MR. HORAN:

There may be -- Justice Scalia,

14

there may be some incentive do so, subject to other

15

constraints, including the -- the usual practice of

16

charging, for instance, most offenses as they come under

17

There will be

Your Honors, for the -- in addition to the

20

fact that our interpretation does not involve, we think,

21

adding anything into the text that others must, we think

22

it establishes -- it advances an evident purpose that

23

Congress had in this, which was to ensure that a

24

defendant who is convicted under 924(c)(1)(A) receives

25

some sufficient minimum punishment.

After 1998, the 1998 amendments, section

sentences.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479
MR. RYAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to spend some time on the second

16

question in our petition regarding whether other

17

firearms offenses are included within the scope of the

18

"except" clause.

19

But before I do, I'd like to make a couple

20

of points about the first question, which is common to

21

our case and to Mr. Gould's.

22

Justice Sotomayor asked:

Why isn't the

23

government's reading the most natural?

And the answer

24

is pretty simple.

25

half of the "effect" clause with absolutely no practical

The government's reading leaves one

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

effect.

2

The government has, in its current

3

interpretation, suggested that the "except" clause

4

applies to one provision of law outside of 924(c).

5

That's 3559(c).

6

the "except" clause does absolutely no work, both for

7

practical reasons and because of the way 3559(c) is

8

written.

9

And yet with respect to that provision,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

930(c):

A person who

10

kills any person in the course of bringing a firearm

11

into a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in

12

sections setting forth minimums for murder and

13

manslaughter.

14

930(c), no?

15
16
17
18
19

So it would also have an effect in

MR. RYAN:

It's not clear from the

government's argument, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I wasn't sure why it

didn't list 930(c), but -­
MR. RYAN:

As I understand the government's

20

argument, the sentence that -- the only sentence that

21

would count outside of 924(c) would be a sentence

22

specifically for a 924(c)(1)(A) offense -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

does two formulations.
MR. RYAN:

I know, but its brief

It says -­
Exactly right.
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- anything that affects

2

924(c), and then in other places in its brief, it says

3

the -- the "except" clause refers to any higher minimum

4

sentence for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in

5

relationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of

6

violence.

7
8

MR. RYAN:
Sotomayor.

9
10

Those are two different formulations.
That's exactly right, Justice

And if the -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm focusing on the

second formulation.

11

MR. RYAN:

Okay.

That point actually

12

demonstrates why the government's justification for this

13

limitation doesn't hold up.

14

one point, the reason to read "any other provision of

15

law" to include only sentences for 924(c)(1)(A) crimes

16

is because the "except" clause, when it refers to this

17

subsection, refers only to sentences for section

18

924(c)(1)(A) offenses.

19

As the government argues at

Yet, that is not the case.

clause, and it's not the same offense as 924(c)(1)(A),

23

the government's argument about excluding other offenses

that might be separate from 924(c)(1)(A) no longer holds

25

up.

Well, if 924(c)(1)(B) can trigger the "except"

1

The other difficulty with the government's

2

reading, to go back to the practical point, is that if

3

you apply it just to 3559(c), it can have no effect

4

because as a practical matter no one can serve a term of

5

years after successfully completing a life sentence,

6

which is what's required under 3559(c); and 3559(c)

7

itself has a provision that, the "notwithstanding"

8

provision, that makes clear that only the life sentence

9

should be imposed when 924(c) is the third strike for

10
11

purposes of 3559(c).
That, in turn, just leaves future

12

applications, and there the government's scenario under

13

which the language that currently has no effect might

14

have some effect is nothing short of far-fetched.

15

would require Congress to amend the sentence of

16

924(c)(1)(A) outside of 924(c)(1)(A) and not indicate

17

how those two penalties should interact.

It

Now, if I could turn to the questions about

19

a transactional limitation, which we suggest.

20

of suggesting that the "except" clause should be limited

21

to sentences for the same transaction is suggested by

22

some of the questions directed to Mr. Gould's counsel.

23

We think that it's the more natural reading of the

24

statute in part because of concerns recognized by this

25

Court in the United States v. Deal, namely that the

statute is not designed and should not be read to give

2

prosecutors unreviewable discretion as to when the

3

minimum sentence in 924(c) ought to be applied or not.

4

It also would preclude the equally odd

5

situation of a defendant being able to benefit from the

6

"except" clause in a multi-count indictment when the

7

defendant has -- faces a higher mandatory minimum

8

sentence for a completely unrelated -- unrelated charge.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where would we look to find

10

the definition of a criminal transaction for these

11

purposes?

12

MR. RYAN:

You could look into 924(c)

13

itself.

Our view is that it would be no different than

14

the transaction that would give rise to the 924(c)

15

charge itself and so, for that reason, would necessarily

16

include the predicate offense or another firearms

17

offense.

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if there were several

during each of those used or carried a firearm?

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you say "different

5

transactions," but I'm looking for the definition of a

6

criminal transaction.

The criminal law has labored with

7

this for a long time.

It's not a self-defining concept,

8

is it, a criminal transaction?

9

MR. RYAN:

No, it's not, but -- Your Honor,

10

but I don't see how it would be any more difficult to

11

determine the transaction than to look at what would

12

constitute the 924(c) offense.

of operative facts that could lead to a 924(c) charge

Now, if I could just spend a little bit of

time on our second question.

Our argument here is

20

fairly straightforward and fairly modest, and it relies

21

on the fact that 924(c) is essentially a firearms

22

offense.

23

paragraphs in 924(c) are primarily about firearms.

24

so, in looking to determine the meaning of "any other

25

provision of law," it is quite natural, as both the

recognized in Whitley, the Second Circuit case, to

include provisions of law outside of 924(c) that punish

firearms offenses.

5

Now, to be sure, this particular limitation

6

is not commanded by the plain language of the statute

7

and rests, like the government's argument, on context

8

and purpose.

9

still gives some effect to the "except" clause.

But the difference is that this argument
It

10

would apply, as here, to other firearms offenses outside

11

of 924(c) like the Armed Career Criminal Act.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it gives broader

effect.

It gives broader effect to the "except" clause,

14

but the government's argument gives effect to the

"except" clause, doesn't it?

16

MR. RYAN:

It gives no practical -­

makes explicit reference to -- to 924(c)?

20

MR. RYAN:

Two points, Justice Alito.

21

First, the government's reading has no practical effect.

22

It leaves the "except" cause with no practical effect.

23

You could take the "except" clause away, and there would

be no difference in terms of the sentence under 3559(c).

7

The

Yes.

-- it was at that point that the

"except" clause also entered into 924(c).
The difficulty with that argument, as we

8

explain in our brief, is that 3559(c) was already linked

9

with 924(c) insofar as both addressed use.

And because

10

3559(c) and 924(c) were already linked, and the

11

"notwithstanding" provision within 3559(c) indicated

12

that if the 924(c) offense is your third strike, you get

13

the life sentence, that's it.

14

Congress then amended 3559(c) to make another connection

15

with 924(c) can't possibly explain why there is a sudden

16

need for the "except" clause.

Well, the fact that

one because it goes to the fact that the government has

three different readings, so one can't say that this

A district court judge in -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Counsel, could I just

ask one simple question, the one I started with earlier,

10

which was, which of the two statements are you

11

advocating?

12

that imposes a greater minimum sentence for violating

13

924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the "except"

14

clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two

15

different places -- the "except" clause refers to a

16

higher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm

17

in relationship to a crime of violence or a drug

18

offense?

19

That the "except" refers to a provision

MR. MCLEESE:

I don't think there needs to

20

be an explicit reference.

21

clause is triggered by an offense which has a greater

22

mandatory minimum and which has the same elements as and

23

is the same offense as a section 924(c) offense.

24
25

I think that the "except"

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

If that's

the case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C.

4

wrong?

Is his allegation correct or is he

5

MR. MCLEESE:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. MCLEESE:

He is incorrect.
Okay.

First, with respect to the

8

internal structure of 924(c), 924(c) as it was amended

9

in 1998 is a somewhat complex statute.

It has a mix of

10

sentencing enhancements and elements which create

11

aggravated versions of the offense, but it is all a

12

single offense for double jeopardy purposes, for

13

purposes of what punishment to impose.

14

the "except" clause operates consistent with the

15

definition I just suggested quite sensibly and tells a

16

district court judge imposing sentence if a defendant

17

has brandished a firearm and also discharged it, you

18

pick one of the 924(c) menu items, they are all a single

19

offense, and you impose a single mandatory minimum

20

sentence that is the greatest of those which are

21

applicable.

And, therefore,

22

Now, with respect to 930(c) -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

So that if

24

he discharges a firearm, and it says it is a sentence of

25

not less than 10 years, and he -- and that firearm is
28
Alderson Reporting Company

1

also a short-barrelled rifle with a 10 year minimum,

2

does he get 10 years, or does he get 20 years?

3

MR. MCLEESE:

He gets 20 years.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. MCLEESE:

How?

Because there are -- the

6

"except" clause says look to your defendant, look to see

7

which -- whether there is any provision of law which

8

carries with it a greater mandatory minimum which

9

punishes the section 924(c) offense.

In that instance,

10

there are two.

12

mandatory minimum.

13

violation, whether aggravated or less aggravated.

2

it's discharged?

3

MR. MCLEESE:

That's not -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't need this

5

provision, the -- your argument can't be that this

6

language is to make sure the district judge knows in

7

that case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year.

8
9

MR. MCLEESE:

That point, Mr. Chief Justice,

applies in support of our position, because everyone

10

agrees that the primary function, the first half of the

11

"except" clause, does exactly that.

12

It does nothing else.

13

clause says "except to the extent a greater minimum

sentence is provided by this subsection," the only

15

function -­

would have thought it would be odd to say when there are

increased minimums that the highest minimum applicable

12

isn't the one that applies.

13

MR. MCLEESE:

I agree with that, but it's

14

important to realize that another issue that a district

15

court judge might confront is whether you should

16

cumulate them.

17

question suggests, that if there are several available,

18

that you get 20 because it's a machine gun and 10

19

because it was discharged.

20

busy district court judges, a provision which says, in

21

figuring out how to sentence a 924(c) offender, you

22

don't have to look through this complex statute to

23

figure out what your sentencing enhancements, do some

24

double jeopardy analysis; all you need to do is simple

25

math.

So it should be, as Justice Sotomayor's

And from the perspective of

You are directed to look to, of all the ones that

1

are available, the one that is longest of the mandatory

2

minimums.

3

The point I was trying to make, though,

4

Mr. Chief Justice, is all of this, the idea that it

5

really isn't that critical even to clarify in the first

6

half of the "except" clause what to do, is consistent

7

with our position, which is the "except" clause all

8

together, both internally to section 924(c) and as it

9

reaches externally, is about clarifying something that,

10

it may be true, district court judges otherwise would

11

have been able to figure out, had they done a lot of

12

analysis.

13

practical utility of it is to clarify a sentencing

14

judge's options with respect to a statute that had been

15

made much more complex.

16

But it makes it much simpler, and the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your main -- the

17

meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right?

18

is this significant provision out there that does

19

provide a greater mandatory minimum.

20

see, as a practical matter, why people would worry about

21

that.

22

well, they put in the "except" clause to be sure that

23

the judge would add another 5 years at the end of a life

24

sentence.

25

Under 3559(c), you get life.

MR. MCLEESE:

There

And I just don't

10

but also internally, what district court judges should

11

do with a complex menu -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Well, just so

13

I make sure I understand, the basic point you're making

14

is that there are some things under your reading that

15

this deals with.

16

disagree as to whether that's necessary or not, and the

17

other is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make

18

any difference whether you're in there for life or life

19

and the additional 5 years.

20

One is the internal point, and we can

It's once you're sure this guy

Now, if you just came across that for the
first time, which would you think was most probable.
MR. MCLEESE:

Well, I think when you place

8

this in the context of the 1998 amendments that enacted

9

the "except" clause, it is quite clear that the former

10

is more plausible.

11

really five features of the 1998 amendments that

12

illustrate that the "except" clause is not to be read as

13

eliminating any sentence for a section 924(c) offense,

14

but rather is clarifying which sentence to impose.

15

The first is that the 1998 amendments,

And the reason I say that, there are

16

setting aside the "except" clause for a moment, in every

17

respect substantially increased the scope and severity

18

of section 924(c).

19

sentences to mandatory all the way to life.

20

responded to this Court's decision in Bailey by

21

increasing the substantive scope of the provision.

22

increased the -- it created increased mandatory minimums

23

for 7-year and 10-year offenses.

24
25

It changed what had been mandatory
It -- it

It

So it would be odd to think that in the
second half of a presumptively narrow exception clause,
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Congress at the same time ran in the direct opposite

2

direction and had a substantial rollback of pre-existing

3

section 924(c) sentencing provisions.

4

be clear, at the time of the 1998 amendments, these

5

Petitioners would have been subject to the mandatory

6

minimum sentences that they received.

7

been subject to 10 years in one of the cases for the

8

drug offense and 5 additional years mandatory and

9

consecutive under 924(c).

And that's -- to

They would have

For the other, they would

10

have -- he would have been subject to 15 years for being

11

a felon in possession and an armed career criminal and 5

12

additional under 924(c).

13

So one of the features that is key is

14

putting this in the context of the 1998 amendments,

15

which were in every respect -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait, but it -- but it

17

does -- it does subject them to less, at least with

18

respect to those -- those enhancements set forth within

19

the subsection itself.

20
21

MR. MCLEESE:

That is true, but that is not

a rollback of pre-existing provisions.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. MCLEESE:

It's a way of -­

Why?

Because none of -- in prior

24

924(c) law, there wasn't a body of law that would have

25

given anybody who would get the benefit of the "except"
38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

clause under 924(c) a higher sentence.

2

"except" clause does is it makes clear under this more

3

complicated scheme that when we are increasing these

4

provisions, a 7 or a 10, you shouldn't telescope them

5

all inside 924(c).

6

you pick the highest.

7

What -- all the

You shouldn't add them all together;

And so it -- the "except" clause is not a

rollback.

direction to the complexity of the newly enacted

10

provision.

11

It is a way of accommodating and giving clear

interpretation.

MR. MCLEESE:

So that's way before the

19

guidelines.

20

in 1998, is they're trying to -- see, in 1998 what

21

they're trying to do is take some of these old

22

provisions and reconcile them with this new system that

23

has come along.

24
25

So what they are trying to do now is the -­

So I agree you have a point there.

But it -- it does make a certain amount of
sense, because what it is saying is, in these cases

you're sure he's got it; now, the additional amount will

3

be controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to

not much discretion.

5

minimums, but there's a little wiggle room.

6

They are pretty close to mandatory

MR. MCLEESE:

On the general approach of

7

Congress under 924(c), it also bears note that in the

8

last 25 years Congress has amended section 924(c) six

9

times, and setting aside for a moment the "except"

10

clause, in all of those amendments Congress has

11

uniformly expanded its scope or increased the severity

12

of sentences.

13

provision in which Congress rolled back section 924(c).

14

And there are several other features of the 1998

15

amendment that make clear that that is not what Congress

16

did.

17

So the "except" clause would be the sole

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you answer

18

Mr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you

19

can read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule

20

of lenity?

21

MR. MCLEESE:

Well, this Court's cases make

22

clear that the rule of lenity comes into play at the end

23

of the analysis only if there is grievous ambiguity

24

after all the considerations of statutory construction

25

have been considered.

We haven't yet discussed all of
40

is no grievous ambiguity.

3

suggest is the only reasonable reading, all factors

considered.

In fact, the reading that we

And if I can turn back to a couple of other

6

features of the 1998 amendments, another feature is

7

the -- the title of the act itself, which is an Act to

8

Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns.

9

just inconsistent with the provision that has these

And, again, it's

10

features and has that act, that it would be a

11

substantial important decrease in the mandatory minimum

12

sentences applicable to a large class of -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a

14

difficult -- you're saying, because Congress wanted to

15

get tough on the people who use firearms in this

16

provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a

17

way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant?

18

MR. MCLEESE:

I don't -- that would push the

19

argument too far.

20

construing this -- the statute as a whole, that that was

21

the clear overall function of that amendment.

22

I think it is highly relevant to

Now, there are two other features of the

23

1998 amendment, which are, it did as has been previously

24

noted -- also, the only other thing that Congress did in

25

the 1998 amendment, other than modifying section 924(c),
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

is it made a corresponding change in section 3559(c) to

2

-- to correspond.

3

front and center in Congress's mind as it was enacting

4

the 1998 amendments.

5

Congress is creating a more complex statute and giving

6

district court judges guidance about which mandatory

7

minimums to select under that statute, to mention and

8

have language that accommodates the fact that there

9

is -­

10

So we know that section 3559(c) was

And it is very natural, when

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, with respect to

11

3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not

12

stricter, right?

13
14
15

MR. MCLEESE:

No, I think they were

clarifying -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you said

16

earlier that the purpose of this, what it does, is it

17

makes sure that you don't add 5 extra years on the

18

people who are sentenced to life.

19

MR. MCLEESE:

I think it clarifies the

20

relationship, and, in fact, arguably it could have

21

clarified the situation in a way that would have been

22

beneficial to defendants.

23

when Congress enacted the first half of the "except"

24

clause, which said pick one and only one mandatory

25

minimum and impose it -- we're talking internally to

And the reason I say that is

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section 924(c) -- if it hadn't mentioned 3559(c), there

2

could have been the idea that if there -- if Congress

3

didn't direct the same approach with respect to 3559(c),

4

there's an implication that in fact you should impose

5

both.

6

And so what it really was doing was

7

clarifying what would have been unclear.

8

again, only half of a presumptively narrow provision

9

which is just clarifying the relationship -­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it is,

Which is right.

11

You're saying when you get life, or you get 5, just

12

serve life; don't serve the extra 5.

13

MR. MCLEESE:

Yes.

Yes, but it's not saying

14

that to defendants.

15

court judges, who just need to know in a simple, clear

16

way what am I supposed to -- what sentence am I supposed

17

to -­

18

It's saying that to busy district

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's the only thing

19

that that additional language which says "otherwise

20

provided by this subsection or by any other provision of

21

law" -- why didn't they just mention 3559(c)?

22

MR. MCLEESE:

Well -­

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the only thing it

24

covers, that tiny little thing, which has no effect at

25

all, except for the benefit of the busy district judges,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

you say.

I -- I find that quite implausible.
MR. MCLEESE:

Well, remember that it was -­

3

although it is not hugely consequential to defendants,

4

it was a provision that Congress was directly

5

considering then.

6

But there is another function, which is it

7

creates a default rule for future similar provisions

8

like 3559(c).

9

not limited to its function with respect to 3559(c); it

10

And so there -- and had, again -- so it's

also serves, as Congress often provides, a default rule.

11

And so, again, there is a fifth feature of

12

the 1998 amendments for those of whom this is concern,

13

which is that the legislative history of the provision

14

strongly corroborates our interpretation.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, it's not strongly.

The

16

-- what is it an example?

17

this thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday

18

Congress will pass a new statute, a totally different

19

one, and a busy district judge might think that he

20

should add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to

21

whatever sentence this hypothetical new statute

22

provides, but this will tell him not to do so.

23

have anything in mind?

24
25

MR. MCLEESE:

You're saying the other -­

Did you

Well, I -- there are -- there

are other provisions that, like 924(j), which do provide
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sentences for 924(c) offenses that are codified

2

elsewhere in the code.

3

offenses, that's also quite common.

4

implausible about the idea that -­

5

And with respect to other

JUSTICE BREYER:

So there's nothing

I take it in those other

6

offenses there are other things in the code, and the odd

7

thing about this one is there is no other thing in the

8

code except the one we've been discussing.

9

just wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody

And so I

10

thinking of adding some new thing that this might have

11

been applicable to?

12

I take it your answer is no.

13

Or have you come across anything?

MR. MCLEESE:

I'm not aware that -- that

14

Congress had some particular pending legislation in

15

mind.

16

quite common for Congress to provide penalties for

17

offense A in a different section, and so creating a

18

default rule is a perfectly reasonable thing for

19

Congress to have done while it was clarifying the

20

internal relationships among the various 924(c)

21

provisions and the provision in 3559(c), which is front

22

and center in front of it.

23

My point more generally, though, is that it is

With respect to the legislative history, the

24

"except" clause language was proposed by Senator Jesse

25

Helms.

In the legislative history of the provision,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

there is nowhere any comment by anyone suggesting that

anyone understood it as rolling back pre-existing

section 924(c) penalties or as reflecting a new policy

4

different from the fundamental policy of section 924(c),

5

which has always been defendants who commit drug

6

trafficking offenses or violent crimes and who involve a

7

weapon will get an additional -­

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any

9

evidence in the legislative history that the reason they

10

put this in was to ensure that people who got life would

11

not get life plus 5 years?

12

MR. MCLEESE:

There's no explicit reference

13

to that.

14

from the fact that all of the other explanations are far

15

more implausible.

16

But that is, I think, a -- a good inference

And there is something -- there are two

17

things which support that inference more specifically,

18

one of which is, again, that Congress did have in front

19

of it section 3559(c) and was amending it.

20

The second is that the sole reference

21

anywhere in the legislative history to the "except"

22

clause is in the testimony of a witness at a hearing,

23

and what that witness said about it was that it will

24

prevent confusion with other provisions.

more the negative, which is if the "except" clause, in

part intended to clarify, was instead a major policy

Two responses -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. MCLEESE:

Am I wrong?

Two responses, Justice Breyer,

22

one of which is that Congress has amended 924(c) both

23

before and after this provision, and it's clear that

24

Congress is not shifting away from a mandatory minimum

25

regime to a regime that -- where the guidelines are
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

relied upon to provide the minimum sentence that

2

Congress requires.

3

And it is a shift not just to a guidelines

4

regime, because if this a major policy shift into a

5

different world, there -- it poses a question of

6

statutory construction as well, not just about

7

guidelines.

Congress -- if Congress was shifting in the "except"

clause, there's a question:

22

policy shift?

What's the nature of that

If you were going to try to reduce 924(c)

sentences to accommodate sentences on other provisions

What policy should you pick?

Should you pick any other

question of what is the policy reflected by the statute?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You should pick any

other violent crime or drug trafficking offense that

9

already provides a higher minimum.

10

MR. RYAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That -­
No, it seems to me

12

the perfectly natural reading is to say, look, we are

13

providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when

14

this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you

15

have already got a higher sentence for the violent

16

crime, then this doesn't apply.

17

MR. MCLEESE:

That is a possible policy, to

18

be sure, but one thing -- it's certainly not the only

19

reasonable policy.

20

or you could focus on what the defendant is facing at

21

the sentencing.

22

you would consider.

You could focus on the transaction

All those are among the policy options

And what's interesting is that Petitioners

we do is because, in our view, this provision operates

to prosecute somebody for one of these variants of

17

So how is your reading

different than Mr. Abbott's?
MR. MCLEESE:

Mr. Abbott has two readings,

18

and our reading differs from each of them.

19

Mr. Abbott's readings is transactional in nature.

20

is focused on the section 924(c) offense itself.

21

The first of
Ours

The second of our readings is -- the second

22

of Mr. Abbott's readings is focused on a firearm, just

23

the fact that a firearm is involved.

24

is focused on the use of a firearm in a way that

25

constitutes the section 924(c) offense.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

And, again, ours

So those are

Official

1

the differences.

2

But if I could just point out the other

3

anomalies, there are two other anomalies that we have

4

not yet touched upon.

5

submissions create anomalous patterns of floors of

6

statutory minimums, as we've discussed in the briefs.

7

One of them is that Petitioners'

If a defendant under Petitioners'

8

submission, principal submission, has committed a drug

9

offense that carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence

10

and brandishes a firearm, it is -- carrying a 7-year

11

minimum, the floor is 12 years.

12

drug offense is more aggravated and carries a greater

13

sentence so that there's a 10-year mandatory minimum,

14

the overall mandatory minimum, under Petitioners'

15

submission, reduces to 10.

16

If that defendant's

And there is the further anomaly that for

17

offenses that are different, Petitioners' submission is

18

that the defendant will end up, although adjudicated

19

guilty of a section 924(c) offense, with no sentence

20

whatsoever.

21

of guilt.

22

felon in possession and is sentenced under the Armed

23

Career Criminal Act, when the judge goes to sentencing,

24

the judge, on Petitioners' view, says:

25

15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act; that

There will be a free-floating adjudication
And because the defendant, let's say, is a

52
Alderson Reporting Company

I will give you

1

triggers the "except" clause, and therefore, I impose no

2

sentence whatsoever under section 924(c).

3

an anomaly.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That also is

As Justice -- as

5

Justice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into

6

account in figuring out what sentence he would want to

7

impose beyond the greater minimum.

8
9

MR. MCLEESE:

That is true.

My point about

the anomaly is just that it is very strange, to my

10

knowledge unheard of, to have a judge go to sentencing

11

and have a series of adjudications and to tell the judge

12

as to one of them it's not the greater or lesser

13

included offense of another; you don't even need to

14

impose a sentence on that -- on that adjudication.

15

backdrop basic assumption is, on each of the

16

adjudications, you impose a sentence.

17

The

Now, that's not true if offenses are greater

18

or lesser or are the same offense, for double jeopardy

19

purposes.

20

true with respect to offenses like being a felon in

21

possession of a firearm and being someone who violated

22

924(c) that are different offenses in double jeopardy

23

law and have always been given separate judgments,

24

separate punishments.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479

7
8
9

Thank you,

MR. RYAN:

I'd like to make two points on

rebuttal.
There has been a great deal of discussion

10

about the general purpose of 924(c), but as this Court

11

has indicated, the best indication of a statute's

12

purpose is the statute's language, and although the

13

government argues that the sole purpose of 924(c) was to

14

enhance punishment for defendants, the "except" clause

15

belies that simplistic assertion of the purpose.

16

"except" clause actually mediates the punishment that is

17

provided in 924(c).

18

The

The government's reading, at the end of the

19

day, wants to rely on purpose in order to give no effect

20

to the "except" clause.

21

instruction to busy district court judges, even putting

22

aside the impossibility of serving an additional

23

sentence after completing a life sentence, doesn't hold

24

up, because the government never disputes the fact that

25

3559(c) begins with the statement, "Notwithstanding any

The idea that 3559(c) is an

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other provision of law."

2

So the busy district court judge never needs

3

to turn to the "except" clause in 924(c)(1)(A) to know

4

that you impose a life sentence when the third strike is

5

a 924(c).

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Whenever Congress uses a

7

phrase like that, "notwithstanding any other provision

8

of law," does that mean that Congress must think that

9

there is some provision of law that falls within that?

10

MR. RYAN:

Possibly, yes, and that -- here,

11

the other provision of law would be 924(c), and so the

12

point would be -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't Congress commonly do

14

that to make sure that something covers any existing

15

statute there might be that would fall within that,

16

without necessarily saying, well, there are two of

17

them -- if there are two, maybe there are three?

18

through the entire code to find out how many there might

19

be, or if there is any?

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. RYAN:

Going

Yes, Justice Alito, and that's

consistent with my point, is that -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

But it's not consistent with

your main argument about the "except" clause, is it?
MR. RYAN:

Well, yes, it is, because the

"except" clause would also apply to any other provision
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of law.
JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but your argument is the

3

"except" clause has to have some pretty substantial

4

effect, or otherwise the "any other provision of law"

5

part of it -- otherwise, they wouldn't have put it in.

6
7
8
9

MR. RYAN:

Oh, I apologize.

I misunderstood

your -- your question.
The "notwithstanding any other provision of
law," in the context of 924(c), would not have any

10

effect if the "except" clause was considered first.

11

3559(c) applies to many other triggering offenses, and

12

so with regards to those -- and the government has not

13

suggested that 3559(c) has -- has no effect.

14

But

The last point I'd like to make is that

15

there's no doubt that regardless of one's view about

16

mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy, no

17

one doubts that Congress has the authority, if it

18

chooses to exercise it, to stack one mandatory minimum

19

sentence on top of another.

20

But as this Court's cases make clear,

21

Congress, under the rule of lenity, needs to make that

22

choice clear.

23

shifting views indicate that Congress has not exercised

24

that choice clearly in this case.

25

And if nothing else, the government's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
