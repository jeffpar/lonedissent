ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN C. CAHN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CAHN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

When it instructed courts to recognize that

12

imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting

13

correction and rehabilitation, Congress intended to end

14

the practice of sending defendants to prison so that

15

they might get treatment.

16

clear on this point:

17

lengthen prison sentences for the purposes of

18

rehabilitation.

19

structure of the statute.

20

The commands of 3582 are

Do not imprison and do not

This plain meaning is confirmed by the

Under the statute, judges have the power to

21

sentence defendants to prison but not to prison

22

programs.

23

Corrections Act and under the Narcotic Addicts

24

Rehabilitation Act.

25

Congress took that power away.

Judges once had that power under the Youth

With the Sentencing Reform Act
That structure makes

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sense only because Congress intended that defendants

2

should no longer be sent to prison for purposes of

3

rehabilitation.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You have, in effect, a

5

one-way ratchet.

6

rehabilitation is a -- a -- a primary or an important

7

component of the sentence, then it reduces the prison

8

term.

9

one-way ratchet.

If the judge really thinks

It could never increase it.

10

MR. CAHN:

So you have a

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that

11

that's correct, that the -- that the way in which the

12

statute is set up, the logic of 3582 is that a need for

13

rehabilitation can push the judge, the sentencing judge,

14

into moving the individual either out of an

15

incarceration sentence into probation or lower the

16

sentence to get that individual into supervisory release

17

where rehabilitation current -- concerns are properly

18

addressed under the statute.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that's -- do

20

you think that's consistent with what Congress thought

21

about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing

22

Reform Act?

23

accurately, in your brief, but was their thinking simply

24

that rehabilitation is very feasible and it's reasonably

25

predictable whether somebody can be rehabilitated or has

And you discuss their thinking, and I think

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been rehabilitated so long as it's done outside of

2

prison, but it just doesn't work in prison?

3

their thinking?

4

MR. CAHN:

Was that

Well, there's relatively little

5

evidence of what Congress thought about the possibility

6

of rehabilitating individuals outside of prison.

7

clear is that they doubted that rehabilitation could be

8

reliably induced in the prison setting.

9

least one comment that indicates that they doubt that we

What's

There is at

10

11

individuals on a regular basis in any case, but they

12

certainly -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it is strange, isn't

14

it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for

15

the supervised release.

16

provision, isn't it?

17

concerned, the judge can take account of rehabilitation

18

in setting the length of the term, but can't do that for

19

the prison time.

20

MR. CAHN:

I mean, that -- that's a

As far as supervised release is

Well, certainly with regard to

21

supervised release, we think, as far as setting the term

22

of supervised release, the judge is required to take

23

rehabilitation concerns into account, and that's because

24

supervised release is intended to smooth the transition

25

from prison to true liberty and is specifically a
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rehabilitative vehicle.

2

Now, with regard to revocation, to the

3

extent that that's -- that's at issue, we concur with

4

the Solicitor General that 3582, by its terms, simply

5

doesn't govern a revocation of supervised release

6

because it's not the imposition of a term of

7

imprisonment but, rather, requiring the individual to

8

serve a portion of the supervised release term in

9

prison.

10

So, by its plain terms, it simply isn't

applicable.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, aren't -- isn't

12

punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each

13

other?

15

think that a judge who knows that someone is going to

2

get a rehab program if they serve 50 months and the

3

sentencing range is between 45 and 55, do you think that

4

they're going to take 50 -- they're not going to choose

5

50 if they understand that there's no chance for this

6

person to be deterred without drug treatment?

7

MR. CAHN:

The problem is the judge has no

8

ability to ensure that the individual gets that

9

treatment if they're sent to prison.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the whole point, because what the judge said was

4

MR. CAHN:

That's how I read the

Well, Judge -- I mean, Justice, I

5

would disagree with that characterization of Judge

6

Moskowitz's comments, and I'd point specifically to the

7

Joint Appendix, really, at pages 25 through 38, and

8

particularly to pages 27 through 29, where he very

9

specifically says not that he's imposing this time for

10

punishment purposes, but really to get her into the drug

11

program.

12

sentence, 46 months plus 5 months for the bail jump, and

13

one of the factors that affects this is the need to

14

provide treatment.

15

enough to get the 500-hour drug program.

16

He says:

I'm going to impose a 51-month

In other words, so she is in long

And then, again, when he actually imposes

17

sentence, he says -- the judge says:

18

sentence -- I'm sorry.

19

recommends, strongly recommends, that she participate in

20

the 500-hour drug program.

21

Well, he says:

He is talking at length about the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

seriousness of the crime.
So what I'm asking you is, if what we see is

3

a judge who's talking about a flip situation, i.e., you

4

need to punish strongly because the crimes are serious,

5

and an added benefit is rehabilitation, why does that

6

violate 3582?

7

"recognizing," stops a judge from saying without

8

something there's going to be no deterrence?

9

What about 3582, in using the word

MR. CAHN:

There's nothing that stops a

10

sentencing judge from saying I think that

11

incapacitation, retribution, deterrence justify a

12

sentence of X, and in addition you'll receive

13

rehabilitative resources while you're inside; make -­

14

you know, make best use of them.

15

stops a judge from urging a defendant to, in fact, make

16

better of herself while she's in prison or outside.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's nothing that

So you're talking only

18

about when rehabilitation is the primary purpose?

19

the issue here is what was the judge's primary purpose?

20

MR. CAHN:

No.

No.

So

Whenever the judge

21

lengthens a sentence or imposes a sentence of

22

imprisonment that that judge otherwise would not have

23

imposed, that is a violation of 3582.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You could -­

talismanic words where the judge says what I said?

Alderson Reporting Company

This

crime is so serious that the sentence should be X

amount, and now talismanically I'll say rehab is just a

3

side effect, really the sentence is motivated by -­

4

completely by punishment?

5

MR. CAHN:

I think a fair reading of Judge

Moskowitz's statements at the sentencing was that, in

fact, he was lengthening the sentence for purposes of

rehabilitation -­

will be received.

MR. CAHN:

Indeed, he did, and I believe

10

that he was taking into account his own knowledge of the

11

prison system and what it would require to allow Ms.

12

Tapia to participate in the 500-hour program.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if -- putting

14

aside the particular statement here, what if a judge

15

says:

16

deterrence; that's what -- and that's what's going to

17

guide me, and I think you will not be deterred if I only

18

sentence you for 2 years, but I think if you have to go

19

away for 3 years, you will appreciate that what you've

20

done is wrong and you won't do it again.

I appreciate that one purpose of punishment is

21
22

Is that for rehabilitation, that extra year,
or is it for punishment?

23

MR. CAHN:

I believe that's for punishment

24

and deterrence, and I don't believe that's an improper

25

purpose.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe -- what

2

is the difference between deterrence and rehabilitation?

3

The person doesn't commit any crimes anymore but wishes

4

-- wishes she could?

5

rehabilitated, she doesn't want to?

6

a very artificial distinction.

7

MR. CAHN:

Or -- and, well, if she's
It seems to me it's

Well, I don't think it is,

8

because I think we can look at the purposes Congress had

9

in mind when it enacted the statute and, in particular,

10

the system it had in mind, the system it intended to

11

overturn when it enacted the statute.

12

before, one of the statements, a prominent statement, in

13

the Senate report that comes up again and again is

14

Congress doubted that rehabilitation could be reliably

15

induced in the prison setting.

being overturned was one of coercive rehabilitation in

17

which individuals were sent to prison and prison

18

sentences were tied to their completion of these

19

programs.

As I mentioned

The system that was

And so for that reason, I think when you

21

look at a sentence that's employed specifically to get

22

somebody into treatment, it is exactly within the

proscription Congress intended.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF VACATUR

5
6

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

Section 3582(a) prohibits courts from

8

imposing or lengthening a term of imprisonment to

9

promote a defendant's rehabilitation, including by

10

facilitating her access to a prison drug treatment

11

program.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Roberts, could I take

13

you back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start

14

about the one-way ratchet?

15

theory about what Congress might have been thinking when

16

it said you can't think about rehabilitation to sentence

17

or to lengthen a sentence, but you can think about

18

rehabilitation to make a decision not to sentence or to

19

shorten a sentence?

20

in Congress's mind?

21

What's the government's

What would -- what would have been

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, Congress was intending

22

to reject the prevailing rehabilitation model of

23

sentencing, and under that model, defendants were kept

24

in prison until they were declared rehabilitated based

25

on their participation in treatment programs.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

And what

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress determined was that -- that coercing

2

participation in prison programs that way wasn't -- had

3

failed and that rehabilitation couldn't be accomplished

4

reliably in a prison setting.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -­

That's only one-half of what

6

the thinking was at the time about rehabilitation.

The

7

thinking was that -- that some people were being

8

sentenced to coercive rehabilitation, but also that

9

other people were being paroled before they should be on

10

the theory that they had been rehabilitated.

11

general skepticism about rehabilitation, and that is

12

inconsistent with the idea that you can take

13

rehabilitation into account in going down, but you can't

14

take rehabilitation into account in going up.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

It was a

Well, Congress expressly

16

determined to retain -- there were people that said

17

rehabilitation never works; it can't be a legitimate

18

purpose of sentencing.

19

that far.

20

purpose of sentencing.

21

3553(a)(2)(D).

And Congress decided not to go

It expressly retained rehabilitation as a
That's reflected in section

22

But what Congress determined was that it -­

23

that because you couldn't reliably induce it in prison,

24

it wasn't appropriate to deprive defendants of their

25

liberty, expend the resources on keeping them in prison
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for that purpose, but that -- that rehabilitation

2

remained a possibility, that other forms of sentencing

3

were appropriate ways to attempt to achieve

4

rehabilitation, and that's why Congress expressly

5

provided that, in imposing a sentence of probation, the

6

court can require a defendant to participate in

7

particular treatment programs -­

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, but that's different

from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the

10

theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a

11

lengthier sentence isn't needed.

12

Would you agree that when the guidelines

13

were mandatory a judge could not sentence to -- to

14

additional time, certainly not additional time outside

15

the guideline range for the purpose of rehabilitation,

16

but the judge also generally could not depart below the

17

guideline range on the theory that this defendant had

18

led a life of crime because the defendant lacked

19

vocational skills or the defendant was dependent on

20

drugs or alcohol, and with treatment outside of

21

incarceration, those problems which had led to the

22

criminality could be alleviated?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

I think it would depend

24

whether that was an aggravating or, you know, mitigating

25

circumstance that the guidelines hadn't adequately taken
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

into account, but I don't think that Congress was trying

2

to prevent a court from selecting another sentencing

3

option, such as probation, in lieu of imprisonment

4

because the court determined that the primary purpose of

5

the sentence should be rehabilitation, or to shorten the

6

sentence to speed the defendant from imprisonment to

7

supervised release, where the court could guarantee the

8

defendant would participate in programs.

9

On the other hand, if the -- it was very

10

important, if there were important purposes of

11

protecting the public, deterring the defendant from

12

committing other crimes, deterring generally, then the

13

court was supposed to sentence the defendant to prison

14

in accordance with that, even if the defendant also

15

needed rehabilitation.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose the

17

case in which the judge is going to sentence to 2 years

18

no matter, but there is a 2-year rehabilitation program,

19

and the defendant is -- the prisoner is receiving that.

20

Would you say that, at that point, the prisoner is

21

receiving an imprisonment term and rehabilitation?

22
23

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the prisoner is

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

conjunctive -­

12

MR. ROBERTS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -­
-- and you can have

imprisonment and rehabilitation at the same time?
MR. ROBERTS:

Congress intended that, even

16

if a defendant needed rehabilitation, if the other goals

17

of sentencing such as deterrence and protecting the

18

public justified a term of imprisonment, that the court

19

should impose a term of imprisonment.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, yes, but what Congress

2

wanted courts to -- required courts to recognize was

3

that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of

4

promoting rehabilitation.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We're -- we're talking

about what the statute says, and the question indicates,

exclusive.

Now, this case is a little different

10

because she didn't get it, but let's just talk about the

MR. ROBERTS:

I agree that you can -- there

13

can be rehabilitative programs in prison.

14

Congress was trying to preclude was imposing

15

imprisonment for the purpose of providing those programs

or lengthening the imprisonment term for that purpose.

MR. ROBERTS:

I think generally you take the

2

of the sentence are, and the sentence has to be

of promoting -- that imprisonment is an appropriate

means of promoting rehabilitation but is in fact doing

that, but not -- but being disingenuous about the

21

court's reason, then the court is violating the statute,

22

but we're not going to know that.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does the defendant

24

have the right to raise arguments and inquire into that

25

in -- in every case?

Say that, well, he did say this
20

was just to -- just to punish me, but here is a list of

2

10 cases where I think it's like my case and those

people got less.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

I think that -- that it's

5

going to be hard for the defendant to obtain reversal of

6

a conviction under those circumstances.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think it's

8

going to be hard for the government to defend a sentence

9

under those circumstances.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think, as I said, that

11

the words that you -- that the court is required to give

12

its reasons for imposing sentence.

13

district courts honestly give their reasons for imposing

14

the sentence and that if the court is indeed lengthening

15

the term of imprisonment because the court wants the

16

defendant to be in a program, that the court will say

17

that's what they're doing, just as Judge Moskowitz did

18

here.

is not an appropriate means of promoting rehabilitation,

required to do in -- in a probated term, but not in how

16

long he's going to stay in prison before he gets

17

probation.

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, but the court can also

19

consider rehabilitation to choose a sentence of

probation rather than a sentence of imprisonment.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the judge thinks

that a -- a defendant would benefit from a type of a

vocational or educational training that may be available

in the particular community where this defendant

Alderson Reporting Company

What would the judge do then?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think the court can still

3

require the availability -- require that as a condition

of supervised release if the judge thinks that that's -­

5

or as probation; if the judge thinks that that's a

have to decide whether moving from -- whether having the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm

Counsel, can a judge who

believes a defendant is dangerous to the public and

10

thinks that that danger can't be abated without a drug

11

treatment program, could the judge nevertheless under

12

3553(a)(2)(C) say, because of the danger to the public,

13

I'm going to lengthen the sentence?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in the hopes that a

16

drug rehabilitation program will be available?

I don't

17

care if it is or it's not; this person's dangerous to

18

the community otherwise?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

I think the judge can say that

20

-- that this person needs to be in prison for this

21

amount of time to protect the public.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's different than

23

what the judge did here, where he talked about,

24

explicitly, on page 26, "it has to deter" -- the

25

sentence has to deter criminal conduct by others, and it
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has to protect the public from further crimes of the

2

defendant, and the sentence -- that's a big factor here,

3

given her failure to appear and what she did out on

4

bail.

6

So, if the sentence has a dual motive, is
that okay?

MR. ROBERTS:

Right.
But my question is, is a

dual-motive sentence permissible?

MR. ROBERTS:

No, a dual-motive sentence -­

15

if one reason that the judge is selecting the term is to

impose a sentence of imprisonment, that violates the

prohibition.

the same otherwise, then that would be harmless error.

MR. BIBAS:

Thank you.

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

9

Sentencing judges may consider needed

10

correctional treatments in deciding both whether to

11

imprison and for how long.

12

rejected the rehabilitation model's unstructured

13

sentencing procedures designed to confine every inmate

14

indefinitely until a parole board found he had reformed

15

himself.

16

The Sentencing Reform Act

It did not, however, forbid treatment

17

programs targeting specific defendants' pathologies,

18

such as the drug treatment at issue here.

19

rejected one means of promoting rehabilitation that was

20

bound up with indeterminate sentencing, not

21

rehabilitation itself.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Act

I could follow your

23

argument much better if the judge could say that this

24

specialized program -- as I am making that a term of

25

your incarceration.

The disturbing factor about your
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument is the judge can only recommend; the judge has

2

no way of making sure that this person will be in prison

3

longer and get the treatment the -- the judge wants,

4

because the judge can't control where the person will

5

serve her sentence and what treatment will be available

6

for her.

7

MR. BIBAS:

Your Honor, I don't believe

8

that's a large concern for several reasons.

The first

9

is this Residential Drug Abuse Program, RDAP, is given

10

to 93 percent of eligible defendants.

11

Petitioner did not get it is because she affirmatively

12

refused, said she was not interested.

The only reason

13

The second point I would make is that if we

14

look at the legislative history, the Petitioner and the

15

government's reply brief say, well, this Act stripped

16

judges of the power to do this.

17

clear this was a simple administrative simplification

18

designed to make it clear that the Bureau of Prisons

19

ultimately controlled all of these things but that at

20

the same time it was supposed to listen seriously to

21

judges' recommendations.

The Senate report makes

refused, she said she wasn't interested.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. BIBAS:

29

The fact that a judge must predict the future calls for

appropriate skepticism and a statement of reasons in

possibility.

it -- it does not help your case that the reason she did

I'm saying that it's -- it -­

10

not get the rehabilitative treatment that this judge

11

wanted her to get was that she simply refused it.

12

does that help your case?

13

if, as the other side says, had to be the case, he had

14

imposed this rehabilitative measure as a portion of

15

supervised release.

Why

She couldn't have refused it

Then she would have had to take it.

MR. BIBAS:

Your Honor is correct that there

is a contingency involved here, but the contingency

involved is no greater than the contingency involved in

a reason for skepticism.

programs, and so forth.

those things are rehabilitation, that there's nothing

5

left over when you say that the judge can consider all

6

of those things.

7

MR. BIBAS:

8

phrased correctly.

9

consider rehabilitation.

10

Our point is not that judges can't
It is that judges may not use

imprisonment as the means of promoting rehabilitation.

11
12

Your Honor, I don't believe you

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

Well, I'll ask the

same question.

13

MR. BIBAS:

Yes.

You're saying they can

consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, they

cannot consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence,

but they can consider all these programs in imposing a

sentence.

all these programs and rehabilitation?

20

they -- they can consider all these programs, what's

21

left over that they can't consider?

22

And I'm saying what's the difference between

MR. BIBAS:

Once you say

Your Honor, I think the answer

23

is clear if we look at the statutory text.

It's in

24

Petitioner's brief, the blue brief at Appendix 2 and

25

Appendix 3.

The contrast becomes clear if we look at

3

everything that was ever considered rehabilitation.

4

is a specifically limited subset of rehabilitation.

5

There were four simple purposes of
And (D) is not
It

It must be needed, must be educational or

6

vocational training, medical care or other correctional

7

treatment, and it must be in the most effective manner.

8

So, judges may no longer rest on what Judge

9

Frankel and the -- the Senate decried as the eerie

10

nonsense that everyone can be rehabilitated simply by

11

throwing them in prison or simply by having everybody

12

going to social workers or classes, but because

13

criminality is not a pathology that needs treatment.

14

But he and the Senate report contrasted that with drug

15

treatment, which is very different, because there's a

16

diagnosed pathology, there is a criterion for success

17

that's measurable, and there's a fixed limited time.

18

And that third point is crucial here,

19

because both Petitioner and the government in their

20

argument said that you can't keep someone in jail tied

21

to completion of programs or keep them in until he has

22

been rehabilitated through treatment.

You have to reconcile the two sections.

17

the way to reconcile them is to say that the former

applies to sentencing in general but when you're dealing

19

with the length of a sentence of imprisonment or whether

20

there should be any imprisonment at all, you cannot

21

consider rehabilitation.

MR. BIBAS:

the point that logically there is a distinction between

imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. BIBAS:

Your Honor, judges in supervised

2

release, it -- it -- it's hard to understand why in

3

3583(e)(3) judges may consider rehabilitation in

4

deciding whether to impose a term of imprisonment on

5

resentencing, and we've been offered no logical

6

explanation as to why that same logic Congress would

7

have meant a flat ban here that it didn't spell out in

8

an initial sentencing.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- it does seem to me

10

that the principal trouble I have with your argument is

11

that, as Justice Scalia mentioned, the judge can't be

12

certain that the treatment will -- will be provided.

13

And in an answer to an earlier question you said, well,

14

90 percent of the time the judge's recommendation is

followed, the program is -- is offered.

16

Suppose we're only 10 percent of the time?

17

Suppose only 10 percent of the time could or did the

18

Bureau of Prisons follow the judge's recommendation,

19

wouldn't your interpretation of the statute then be very

20

difficult to sustain?

21

MR. BIBAS:

Justice Kennedy, while I agree

22

that the reliability of the prediction is an important

23

factor, I think this is dealt with through the ordinary

24

appellate review that this Court has fleshed out in

25

Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough.

If there's 93 percent

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

likelihood, predictability, here, then the judge can

2

give it a fair amount of weight as the judge can give a

3

fair amount of weight to deterrence calculations.

4

it's highly unpredictable, then the judge shouldn't be

5

putting very much weight on that at all.

6

If

And I would point out particularly that if

7

we look at those appellate review cases, it's very

8

relevant that the judge here imposed a sentence within

9

the range.

As Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there are

10

multiple explanations going on here; the judge arrives

11

at a sentence within the range.

12

that it's even a but-for cause versus just a hope.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bibas, just practically

21

speaking what does this clause instruct a court not to

MR. BIBAS:

It instructs a court to bear in

mind that simply locking someone in a cell away from his

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, really who thought

that?

rehabilitation, they were talking about drug programs,

6

they were talking about education programs, they were

7

talking about vocation programs.

about some idea that had passed away long since, that

This was 1984.

When people talked about

you.

11

MR. BIBAS:

A couple of responses that I

12

think show that to be incorrect.

13

most of the references in the Senate report are to just

14

generic open-ended education, vocation, and counseling.

15

We see maybe one reference to alcohol and drug treatment

16

in there.

17

The first of these is

The second of these is that idea of

18

isolation, though it had diminished, was still alive in

19

the 1970s.

20

the "Guides for Sentencing" in 1974, that said that

21

confinement, quote, "may be necessary to break criminal

22

associations and in time to modify antisocial attitudes

23

and tendencies."

25

There was a widely cited manual for judges,

My third point is this is not just about the
substantive idea of rehabilitating.
38
Alderson Reporting Company

The government and

Petitioner point out that there was a rehabilitation

model, a procedural approach here that was bound up with

3

that history of the penitentiary, and the approach was

4

that, in the Senate report, the rehabilitation model

5

ties prison release dates to successful completion of

programs.

We don't have open-ended, unpredictable

sentences any more.

The Sentencing Reform Act in

you're right, then this choice of extending a term to

introducing that, just what the framers of the Reform

The RDAP program here requires 12 months before

admission having a provable addiction or abuse, so it's

3

about 30, 35 percent of inmates.

4

But granted that issue, that's why the

5

Sentencing Reform Act requires statements of reasons,

6

subject to appellate review.

7

widely, this Court's case law in Rita, Gall, and

8

Kimbrough allows appellate courts to harmonize what

9

they're doing.

If judges are varying

If this judge had added 5 years to her

The very next

"In considering a

Congress meant to omit it.

The other place in the Act where Congress

explicitly banned the factor was in 28 U.S.C. 994(d).

If rehabilitation can always be a

The simple answer is if the judge is

imposing the sentence because of rehabilitation, they

can't do that.

Is that what you're arguing or are you

arguing they can do it except within a range?

11

quite sure I understand how far you're going.

12

But

MR. BIBAS:

I'm not

I understand, Justice Sotomayor.

13

Our primary argument is that 3582's recognizing clause

14

isn't about this at all.

15

3553(a)(3)(D), what is it that's needed correctional

treatment, and if it fits within (a)(2)(D), ordinary

appellate review.

18

This is dealt with by

If the Court is not comfortable with that

19

and thinks that there ought to be more discouragement,

20

we do have a fallback argument that says that the Senate

21

report talks about discouraging using this as the sole

22

basis, right, but that if it's one of several factors,

23

if it appears to be given a proper balanced weight, then

24

there's no need to be so suspicious of it.

25

when we look at the case law in the circuits -- and
42
Alderson Reporting Company

And indeed,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we've surveyed the most recent 150 or so cases on

2

rehabilitation in the courts -- we see very rarely -­

3

first of all, we haven't found any cases where judges

4

are putting someone into prison versus out based solely

5

on this.

6

We find only a couple of cases where judges

7

appear to be lengthening a sentence solely because of a

8

desire to put someone into drug treatment.

9

what's happening is something like what happened here.

Usually,

10

The judge is balancing three or four factors; it's in

11

the mix; the judge might well have gotten the same

12

result anyway.

13

Are we going to forbid courts to have that

14

kind of reasoned, open review, subject to appellate

15

review, in order to ban something that isn't banned in

16

the way that 994 bans race and sex or 3583 bans

17

retribution?

18

things elsewhere and it's not the wording Congress chose

19

here, especially since this -- it's a subordinate

20

clause, it's hidden, it's not at all clear in

21

undercutting the main clause of 3582 in saying shall

22

consider all the factors of punishment here to the

23

extent they apply in an individual case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

It's simply not the way the statute words

That's an odd way to support the

MR. BIBAS:

Justice Kennedy, first of all,

18

There are some drug education programs, I

It's just this

The second point is, as I said, one of the

19

explicit purposes of sentencing is deterrence.

A judge

20

can never guarantee that he's going to deter a

21

particular offender from committing a crime in the

22

future.

23

with the help of the probation or pretrial services

24

officer's report, and that's subject to appellate

25

review.

The judge has to make an educated prediction

But the fact of the prediction, the fact of
44

uncertainty about whether someone will be deterred or

2

not doesn't disable the judge from weighing that

prediction.

Because that was pretty clear indication of

shall take it into account only to the extent that it is

relevant; and the commission decided as with most of

13

these other factors that drug dependence shall not be

14

used ordinarily in sentencing outside the range, but

left it to the judge to decide within the range.

point of approving of in-prison drug treatment as

effective to reduce recidivism where we have a fixed

term and a specific diagnosis that Congress has funded

and encouraged with a 12-month sentence reduction.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. CAHN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

22

Let me begin with a couple points about the

23

plain language of this statute.

When a defendant is

24

sent to prison so that he can gain access to

25

rehabilitative programs, imprisonment is used as a means
48
Alderson Reporting Company

to promote rehabilitation.

3

strictly speaking within the very prohibition that

Congress has articulated.

5

and counsel has left off the last few words in

7

discussing that purpose of sentencing that's set out

8

there.

9

resources be provided in the most effective manner.

Congress required that these rehabilitative
As

10

is discussed in the brief, Congress had determined with

11

regard to in-prison rehabilitation programs that they

12

simply were not the most effective manner.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, this makes a

14

lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities

15

in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes

16

outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence

17

than otherwise the guidelines would determine for

18

rehabilitation purposes.

19

But not infrequently guideline ranges are

20

within very narrow scopes, and in fact there are some

21

prison advantages that you get from being sentenced to a

22

year and a day that you don't get if you're sentenced to

23

12 months; and district courts routinely will choose

24

between a year and a day or 12 months based on knowledge

25

about what might be available if you're there for over a
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

year.

Why is that wrong?

2

What would be the difference?

You see, I'm

3

having a hard time in this case, because if a judge

4

comes in and says guideline range is 50 to 60, I think

5

in the middle is perfectly fine, I just don't know

6

whether I should give him 54 or 55 months, but I know

7

that at 55 months there's this kind of program

8

available.

9

it is -- judging is not so precise that you know exactly

I'm going to do -- I'm going to -- you know,

10

where to go within the small ranges, and so there are

11

many factors that influence that decision.

12

we announce a rule that says to a judge in those

13

situations, don't give him that extra month?

14

MR. CAHN:

Why should

Because Congress has prescribed

15

it.

16

be allowed; and it may seem unreasonable to all of us,

17

but Congress made a determination that it wasn't

18

appropriate to lengthen these sentences or impose them

19

for purposes of rehabilitation.

20

Because Congress made the choice that it shouldn't

Are you arguing for

something like a plain statement rule, if the judge says

22

plainly, I'm increasing your sentence so you can get

possibly be situations in which one could infer that the

25

desire to provide for rehabilitation in prison had

MR. CAHN:

For example, choosing a

It's possible, but I think that

8

this Court entrusts sentencing judges to follow its

9

mandate, and if this Court says you're not to increase

10

sentences for the purposes of getting people into

11

rehabilitative programs, then you should state why

12

you're putting people in prison, that we can count on

13

those reasons to be honestly and truthfully given.
