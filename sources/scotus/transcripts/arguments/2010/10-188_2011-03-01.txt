ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REISS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a FOIA

12

response is a report or investigation within the meaning

13

of the False Claims Act public disclosure bar.

14

position that it is allows the Court to reach the

15

critical question whether a relator has contributed

16

genuinely valuable information.

17

Mr. Kirk and the Government would disallow the public

18

disclosure bar before reaching that critical issue, and

19

it would therefore lead to a host of lawsuits by

20

relators with no meaningful information to contribute,

21

and that is precisely the result that the public -- the

22

public disclosure bar is intended to prohibit.

23

Now -­

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Our

The position taken by

But suppose the FOIA

information is just to confirm, to back up, to fill out;
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the -- the relator suspects there's a fraud going

2

on, and he thinks that the -- the fraud will be

3

documented by filings that the alleged fraudulent party

4

has made in the government.

5

MR. REISS:

Justice -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. REISS:

Yes.

Justice Ginsburg, that may well

8

be a legitimate use of a FOIA request, and the question

9

then becomes whether the information disclosed in the

10

FOIA response reveals the allegations and transactions

11

upon which the qui tam suit is based.

12

question, that use by a relator of the FOIA process,

13

doesn't go to whether or not a FOIA response is itself a

14

report or investigation within the statute.

But that

A relator can still escape the public

15
16

disclosure bar if the relator can demonstrate that his

17

complaint is not based upon the allegations and

18

transactions that are disclosed in the FOIA response.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

So in each case, we'd

20

have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was

21

it so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the

22

FOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of

23

the -­

24

MR. REISS:

Precisely, Justice Ginsburg.

fact, what a court should do is precisely what the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court did in this very case in a very thorough

2

opinion.

3

required for the public disclosure bar to be invoked,

4

including whether the FOIA response was a report or

5

investigation, including whether Mr. Kirk's complaint

6

was based on allegations and transactions disclosed in

7

that FOIA response, and concluded that every prong of

8

the disclosure -- public disclosure bar was met, and,

9

therefore, the public disclosure bar prevented

Judge Stein went through every element

10

Mr. Kirk's claims.

11

that we contend ought to happen.

12

And that is precisely the analysis

Under the Government's position and

13

Mr. Kirk's position, you never get to the critical

14

inquiries about whether the allegations in a relator's

15

complaint were publicly disclosed in a report or

16

investigation, because under their view, a FOIA response

17

itself is rarely going to qualify as a -- as an

18

administrative report or as an administrative

19

investigation.

20

We think that view is plainly incorrect

21

under the ordinary uses of the words "report or

22

investigation," a position that was obviously found to

23

be the case by the First, Fifth, and Third Circuits.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If I -- if I submitted,

as we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statements to an administrative office, and then someone

2

from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request

3

to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then

4

become -- does it become the report of the

5

administrative office, rather than my report to the

6

administrative office?

7

MR. REISS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's

8

an interesting question, and whether -- and some lower

9

courts have held that if the Federal -- if the -- if the

10

report -- even though the report is filled out by a

11

nongovernmental person, such as yourself in this

12

instance, it might still qualify as an administrative

13

report because the information being sought is dictated

14

by a Federal administrative agency.

15

Now, we don't think you have to reach that

16

position for -- for Schindler to prevail here, because

17

the one thing that is clear is that a FOIA response by

18

the Department of Labor is itself an administrative

19

report or investigation.

20

It is a Federal -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose that in this case,

21

the agency has said:

Well, we have 10 files where these

22

documents are, and we'll make them available you to in

23

the reading room.

Go to the reading room.

24

Is that a report?

25

MR. REISS:

Justice Kennedy, if the agency
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has exercised some selectivity in terms of what it's put

2

in that reading room, we would argue that it is a

3

report.

4

that's a much closer case.

That's a far cry from what we have here, but

But with respect to FOIA responses, the

when those veteran's documents are just put together in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A

It doesn't sound

22

like in normal parlance if you come to an agency and say

23

I want these documents, and the person comes down and

24

says here they are, he's not going to say here's my

25

report.

He's going to say here are the documents you
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

asked for; this is our response.
MR. REISS:

2

Mr. Chief Justice, it is a

3

report in the following sense:

The agency is saying,

4

one, we have these documents; two, these documents are

5

the very documents you're asking for.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

That is -­

There's information,

7

facts, that you can glean from their action, but that

8

doesn't make what they've done a report.
MR. REISS:

9

Well, with all due respect,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, I think their response in handing

11

over the documents, saying these are the documents, is a

12

report that we have these documents; here are the

13

documents you've requested.

Now, of course -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

So that means that if

15

they tell you go look for it on the Web site of X

16

agency, then they are incorporating everything that that

17

other agency has as part of their report?

18

MR. REISS:

Well, they are -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That it's not a response

20

in telling you you've got to find what you're looking

21

for?

22

MR. REISS:

It is a report in the sense

23

they're reporting where to look for it.

It is a far cry

24

from the FOIA responses at issue in this case and most

25

FOIA responses.

In this case, there are three different

FOIA responses at issue.

The first two FOIA responses

that in 6 of the years -- 6 of the 9 years at issue

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your position

16

that sometimes it can't -- a FOIA response can be a

17

report and other times it's not?

18

MR. REISS:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

Our

19

position is that every FOIA response is itself a

20

report -- many will require an investigation -- but

21

every FOIA response is itself a report within the

22

ordinary meaning of the word "report," which is a

23

notification.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So there's no difference

2

between a report -- the government has an investigating

3

commission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the

4

many government agencies that are just repositories?

5

They accept pieces of paper, reports, filed by other

6

people, like a tax return, like a financial disclosure.

7

The agency does nothing, has no input.
I mean, there's surely different between

8
9

those two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural

10

understanding would be it's a report by the person who's

11

filing it to the agency; and the other, where the agency

12

puts personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of

13

the agency.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking you isn't

3

there a difference between saying we want the raw

4

filings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the

5

government to do any investigations, we want them to do

6

just the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and

7

an agency saying we're going to investigate and make a

8

report, we're going to put our people under the

9

investigators, and we're going to interview witnesses,

10

they're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll

11

make a report?

12

That's how I understand a government report.

13

But it's very hard for me to understand how a report by

14

Schindler becomes a government report simply because it

15

is filed with the agency.

16

MR. REISS:

Justice Ginsburg, we think that

17

reports and investigations can certainly vary

18

drastically in degree and kind.

19

investigation may require millions and millions of

20

documents and take the Justice Department 4 years.

21

An antitrust

On the other hand, if the Department of

22

Labor itself had decided to determine or to investigate

23

whether Schindler itself had filed these VETS-100

24

reports, it would have done exactly what it did in

25

response to Mr. Kirk's FOIA request.
11

It would have -­

Department of Labor Office of Information.
It was sent to the Division on Investigation

and Compliance, located in a completely separate

5

building.

6

Mr. Robert Wilson, who is the chief of the

7

Investigations and Compliance Division.

8

clearly constitutes an investigation, and the results

9

that he gives to Mr. Kirk is clearly a report.

The response to his request was delivered by

His activity

There may be many other agency activities

10
11

that are far more detailed, far more complex, but it

12

doesn't make what is done in response to a FOIA request

13

not a report or investigation.

14

and investigations within the ordinary meaning of those

15

words.
JUSTICE ALITO:

16

They are still reports

But is the question whether

17

the documents that are turned over themselves reports or

18

whether they are included in a report?

19

I thought what

So that, suppose the Department of Labor

23

issued what everybody would concede is a report and

24

appended to that certain documents, wouldn't those

25

documents be in the report, even though they are not the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

report themselves?
MR. REISS:

2

Absolutely, Justice Alito.

3

When -- when a FOIA response says, as it did in this

4

case, we didn't -- say it says we didn't find certain

5

documents; we did find certain documents.

6

documents we found.

7

that's found is part of the report, but the report is -­

8

Here are the

The attachment of the documents

We didn't find some things; we

10

meet the description of what you asked for.

The

11

documents being attached are clearly part of the report.

12

Now, we think that the position taken by the

13

Government and the Respondent also creates fairly

14

serious dislocations.

15

advanced by Mr. Kirk and the Government, many things

16

that are actually called reports by statute are not

17

reports.

18

Under the definition of "report"

The Department of Labor's -- Department of

19

Labor reports that it is required to file detailing its

20

oversight and compliance of VEVRRA, the statute at issue

21

here, is called a report under section 1354.

22

report that every agency must file under the Freedom of

23

Information Act detailing their activities and their

24

compliance with FOIA, itself called a report under the

25

Freedom of Information Act, that is not a report under
13
Alderson Reporting Company

The -- the

2

because they require some element that appears nowhere

3

in the public disclosure bar.

4

of some kind of search for wrongdoing or fraud.

5

definition appears nowhere in the public disclosure bar.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

They require an element
That

We'll find out from them

7

if that is what they have set their position.

I had not

8

read them to say that.

9

challenge your position that every FOIA response is

I read them to say only -- to

10

necessarily a report for purposes of the False Claims

11

Act.

12

MR. REISS:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but their

13

response is that certain FOIA responses will constitute

14

a report or investigation, depending on the underlying

15

documents that are disclosed.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

then you get a report.

18

MR. REISS:

If you request a report,

But -- but their -- their test

19

for the underlying documents is effectively the

20

resurrection of their on-the-trail notion that this

21

Court rejected only last term in the Graham County case.

22

They infused that requirement, the report requirement,

23

with this notion that the government has to be looking

24

for something wrong.

25

disclosed along with, as Justice Alito points out, the

And if the report that is

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

FOIA response is a report that indicates the government

2

was looking for something wrong, well, that's a report.

3

If it doesn't indicate that, it doesn't qualify as a

4

report.

5

We think that crabbed definition of report

6

is not the ordinary definition of report, and this Court

7

has said innumerable times, including I've heard even

8

today that the Court looks to the ordinary, regular

9

meaning of terms.

10
11
12

The ordinary meaning of "report"

clearly encompasses every FOIA response.

the release of documents is only the first test in the

five-part public disclosure bar test.

19

moves the -- the document from the government files into

20

the public and satisfies the first prong of the test.

21

But the Second Circuit said that the second part of the

that are being released.

we've argued that because the FOIA uses the word

16

"response" for the documents we're talking about today

17

and uses the word "report" for that document that goes

18

to Congress, it must have understood those words to mean

19

different things.

MR. WILLENS:

I agree with that, Your Honor,

3

but point two of our brief is an explanation of why it

makes sense not to have a categorical rule that every

5

FOIA response and all of its attachments are always

administrative reports and investigations.

7

you don't have to, to find administrative report an

8

investigation for all purposes in order just to answer

that narrow question.

10

And I submit

For example, the word "investigation" is

11

used in the False Claims Act for a very specific kind of

investigation:

review, is not an investigation.

purpose of the statute.

had thought that the purpose was as -- as Petitioner's

22

not personal to them.

23

Surely, that should bear upon

And Congress amended the

The case doesn't lack merit simply because

7

the whistleblower needs additional evidence to prove his

case in court, and FOIA is a critical aspect of that

9

because relators frequently don't have one piece of

Why isn't that information from the agency a report by

years, and, therefore, your client says they didn't file

24

documents for those 5 years?

25

MR. WILLENS:

There were a few statements
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

wrapped up in that -- in that question, Your Honor.

2

the point I'm trying to make is that Mr. Kirk has a vast

amount of inside knowledge about this breach of contract

that was going on for so many years, and it's different

5

from the notification requirement.

But it's different from saying that there

was a fraudulent scheme going on for 10 or 15 years that

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the -- I think

13

you've just divided up two issues.

certain years.

MR. WILLENS:

The first is, the

It said -- the word is that

reports were not found.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Found.

Now, the issue

19

is different from whether the ones that were found were

20

false or not; is that correct?

21

MR. WILLENS:

That's true, and I would say

22

it's also different from the issue of whether they were

23

filed, because the fact that the agency didn't find them

24

during a cursory review of its records, which is -- a

25

reasonable review of the records is all it's required to
26

would go on much further.

It's a pattern of -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

How else does your client

know that there were no reports filed for these years,

11

which is part of the -- part of the claim here?
MR. WILLENS:

12

He knows that Schindler did

13

not collect the information that it would have needed in

14

order to file accurate reports.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

He wasn't there during

He was only not there during

20

middle of 2003, so he has personal knowledge of all of

21

that failure to collect the information.

22

then, is whether Schindler filed false reports or failed

23

to file them at all, and he alleged, without reference

24

to the FOIA response, that it had to be one or the

25

other.

He was there and he was fired or let go in the

We're the 12(b)(1) motion, Your Honor.

I

3

haven't had an opportunity for discovery and we don't

4

know anything else about Schindler's conduct, but

5

it's -- it's not correct to say that -- well, I think

6

I've answered the question.
JUSTICE ALITO:

7

Well, may I ask you why a

8

FOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test?

9

An investigation, the Court says, quote, "implies a more

10

focused and sustained inquiry toward a government end."

11

Now, the government end in responding to a

12

FOIA request is compliance with FOIA, and somebody has

13

to search for these records and determine whether any

14

exemptions apply, and that would seem to be focused and

15

sustained.

So what element is missing?
MR. WILLENS:

16

The -- there's a missing

17

government end here because all that's happening is the

18

transmission of documents from inside the agency to the

19

outside the agency.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

But that's the way the

21

Second Circuit defined its own, or limited its own

22

definition.

23

Circuit incorrect -- pardon me, the Second Circuit

24

incorrect when it says that this is not a governmental

25

end?

But why isn't it -- why isn't the Ninth

It is a governmental end.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WILLENS:

Obviously, satisfying the

2

requirements of FOIA and its regulations is a government

3

end to that extent, but the Second Circuit was trying to

4

distinguish between the substantive work of an agency

5

and the more ministerial but still important act of

6

taking documents out of files and sending them out to

7

the public.

8

in most cases from other programmatic officers in an

9

agency, because we want to keep that act of taking

A FOIA officer is -- is separate and apart

documents out of the files and making them public

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The person is -- the

14

person is separate but is often dealing on a regular

basis with people who have line responsibilities and

16

something else.

17

MR. WILLENS:

Of course.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He sees something -­

19

well, that looks like it might be a problem -- he gets

on the phone or goes down there and says:

21

22

MR. WILLENS:

Of course.

Is this

I didn't mean to

23

say that they don't speak to them.

24

there's a different line of authority in most cases, and

25

it's a different kind of mission.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

It's just that

So I -- I hear the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question, and I understand the problem, but at some

2

point you need to distinguish between what FOIA's trying

3

to do, which is to make documents public, and what the

4

government agency's work is, which is to implement its

5

policies, procedures, sign contracts, build roads and

6

whatever else it does.
There's such a strong government purpose in

7
8

getting these documents out to the public, and

9

specifically in this case to relators and whistleblowers

10

that this Court has held, 15 -- has held, almost 15

11

years ago, that that is why Congress amended the statute

12

in 1986, and to tell the Congress now 25 years later

13

that they made a mistake when they used the word

14

"administrative report" and they accidentally covered a

15

vast number of documents, they could have used the word

16

"agency records," which they used in FOIA to cover

17

everything.

18

set of enumerated sources, specifically so that other

19

documents would be available to relators.

20

But instead, Congress chose a very narrow

As I tried to say before, getting those FOIA

21

documents out to a relator is particularly important,

22

because it has the correspondence between Schindler or

23

other contractor and the government.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you determine which

government ends count and which government ends don't
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

count?
MR. WILLENS:

2
3

My only argument is that FOIA

is a different kind of mission.
JUSTICE ALITO:

4

That's the only

5

government -- compliance with FOIA is the only

6

government end that doesn't count?
MR. WILLENS:

7

I believe FOIA is a special

8

case, Your Honor, and there are many reasons why that -­

9

that would be the case.

We've argued that the -- the

10

plain language of FOIA indicates that a response is not

11

a report; a search is not an investigation.
JUSTICE ALITO:

12

So a report that goes to a

13

department or agency's compliance with some law that is

14

not directly related to the mission of that department,

15

that would qualify as a -- as a government end for these

16

purposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count?
MR. WILLENS:

17

FOIA is the only thing that -­

18

that doesn't count.

It's like a publishing house or a

19

little clearing house inside each agency whose job is to

20

take manuscripts, or in this case, reports or audits or

21

hearings or whatever, and take them out into the public.

22

I think it's fair to distinguish between that function,

23

the publication function, and the substantive work of

24

the agency.

25

down a slippery slope which Schindler eloquently

If you don't do that, then you're heading

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

articulated in its reply brief.

You end up at a point

2

where not only FOIA documents are covered, but non-FOIA

3

documents, in one case, even SEC filings, private SEC

4

filings that are automatically posted to the

5

commission's computer, Schindler seems to think that

6

those are administrative reports.
And you've, of course, transformed every

7
8

private document, like these VETS-100 reports, into

9

public documents simply by the process of corporate

10

filing and then release by the government.

11

simply no basis for that in the statute, and it would

12

cause enormous harm to the operation of the statute.

And in that context, the word,

When you speak of a congressional

8

you speak of an administrative audit, that conjures up a

9

certain image that goes beyond the simple search for

10

responsive records in response to a -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your test, am I right -­

12

this is page 21 of your brief -- that it has to go to

13

the uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquiring

14

into wrongdoing.

15

Is that your test?

MS. SHERRY:

I don't think it has to go just

16

to the inquiring into wrongdoing.

17

think about it is whether or not the agency or the

18

governmental entity is engaging in a substantive inquiry

19

into and a substantive analysis of information of data,

20

of facts, and that's the distinction between what an

21

agency does in response to FOIA.

22

I think the way to

FOIA is a means of public disclosure.

It's

23

a method by which an agency grants the public access to

preexisting records that are in its possession.

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

Isn't the test whether -­

3

the test is whether there's a substantive analysis of

4

facts?
MS. SHERRY:

5

There's a substantive analysis

6

of the facts.

For example, in the FOIA context, while

7

the agency is certainly pulling responsive records and

8

is engaging in some sort of inquiry into whether

9

exemptions apply and whether the information can be

10

released or should be released, it's not looking at the

11

data.

12

that document for its substantive content.

It's not looking at the information that's in

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

So -- but when the -- when

14

the DOJ pulls together at the end of the fiscal year the

15

number of FOIA requests that it received and calculates

16

the length of time they were pending and discloses that

17

in the annual freedom of act -- Freedom of Information

18

Act report, that is a report?
MS. SHERRY:

19

I think that would be a report

20

under our definition because the Department of Justice

21

is actually engaging with the data, engaging in the

22

analysis.

23

also requires, for example, the Attorney General to

24

report on how it's encouraging compliance with FOIA by

25

the different agencies.

And if I'm remembering correctly, I think it

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so I think in most of the circumstances

2

that it would still qualify as a report, and I think

3

FOIA is quite distinct from that.

4

And if you look at the facts of this case in

5

particular, it demonstrates what the substance of the

agency's action is in a FOIA case.

Does not the person who processes a

Alderson Reporting Company

FOIA request have to engage in a substantive analysis of

2

facts to determine whether particular documents fall

3

within the scope of the request, whether certain

4

materials are covered by exemptions?
MS. SHERRY:

5

I don't think the -- two

6

answers to that question.

One is I don't think the

7

officer engaging in any substantive analysis of the

8

facts that are in the records that it's disclosing, but

9

the second answer to that question is if that's all

10

that's required, then I think we're back to a position

11

where every disclosure of information by the government

12

would qualify as a public disclosure.
And we not -- we know that's not the choice

14

that Congress made.

It included only specifically

15

enumerated sources, and it chose particular words.

16

chose report, hearing, audit or investigation.

is no such person as Mickey Mouse, it's a fraud, okay?

2

Then you go right ahead and bring the qui tam because it

3

wasn't falling within the exception.

4

Is that right, in the Government's view?

5

MS. SHERRY:

In the Government's view the

6

fact that the information was obtained through a FOIA

7

request doesn't answer the question as to whether the

8

underlying document is an administrative report or an

9

administrative audit or anything else of the sort.

The

10

11

is nothing more than the first -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, you're repeating --

13

I'm trying to show you what the problem is in my mind.

15

that's what I'm trying to get enlightened on.
MS. SHERRY:

there may be difficult questions at the margin.
JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. SHERRY:

In both

circumstances.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MS. SHERRY:

In both circumstances.

Then it's not -- it's not a

10

report and there's been no investigation.

11

words have meaning, and it's significant that FOIA does

12

not refer to what an agency does as an investigation.

13

It refers to it as a reasonable search for responsive

14

records, and this Court has never referred to it as an

15

investigation, no court ever has.

16

there's a substantive distinction between an

17

investigation, certainly between a GAO investigation,

18

between a congressional investigation and what an agency

19

does in response to a FOIA request.

20

And I think

And that's because

To give an example, the GAO is not subject

21

to FOIA, but it does in its regulation respond to

22

requests from the public much the same way that an

23

agency does in response to a FOIA request.

24

would be a rather strange use of the language to think

25

of that as a GAO investigation and to think of the
40

I think it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the FCA, the

have any bearing on this problem prospectively?

17

MS. SHERRY:

On a prospective -- not -- not

directly in that the words "report," "hearing," "audit"

19

or "investigation" are still included, but it did

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. REISS:

Thank you, counsel.

Justice Ginsburg, in response to your

So the government has an automatic ability

So that is a material change in

Let me just address an underlying premise

21

that we've heard, I think, somewhat repeatedly from the

22

Government and Mr. Kirk, and that is this notion that

23

FOIA is simply an automatic process, that agencies are a

24

publishing house or clearinghouses.

25

utterly belied by the statute and the process itself,
42
Alderson Reporting Company

That notion is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and it's utterly belied by the statistics from the

2

Department of Labor in terms of what their responses are

3

and how they do them.
In 2008, which was the last year we were

4
5

able to find statistics for, the Department of Labor,

6

the department at issue here, processed 17,000 FOIA

7

responses.

8

Thirty-two percent were denied in full, 10 percent,

9

based on the statutory exemptions, and 22 percent based

Only 28 percent were granted in full.

10

on other statutes like the Privacy Act, and 40 percent

11

of those 17,000 responses were partial responses.

12

can give you some but not all; and in fact the FOIA

13

responses in this very case not only reported that we

14

found some of the VETS-100 reports in some years, we

15

didn't find them in others; but with respect to the

16

VETS-100 reports that were attached, they actually made

17

redactions, because those redactions were compelled

18

according to the Chief of Compliance and Investigations

19

by the Privacy Act.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we

Mr. Reiss, assuming that

21

the government did all of the steps you took, how does

it promote the purposes of FOIA -­

5

MR. REISS:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How does it

Well -­
Doesn't that seem

7

illogical, meaning the -- the report filed by the

8

employer is not screaming out, "I filed a false report."

9

You need some outside knowledge from that statement by

10

the employer to prove the falsity.

11

promoting FOIA's purposes?
MR. REISS:

12

So how is your rule

Well, Justice Sotomayor, in that

13

hypothetical the relator actually is bringing

14

independent information, and the public disclosure bar

15

would not be invoked -- not because the FOIA response

16

isn't a report; it wouldn't be invoked because the

17

allegations and transactions in the qui tam complaint

18

were not based on; they were not disclosed in the FOIA

19

response.

20

It furthers the purpose of the statute, our

21

interpretation furthers the purpose of the statute

22

because the purpose of the public disclosure bar was to

23

stop qui tam suits from being brought by members of the

24

public based on information equally accessible to anyone

25

in the public.

MR. REISS:

5

Well, one of the purposes of the

public disclosure bar was to stop -- and this Court

7

recognized it in Graham County -- parasitic lawsuits by

relators with no real significant independent or

In fact that's not true.

We have -- that -- because the Government's right;

Congress changed the -- the law from anything that was

in the government's possession and narrowed the scope of

15

the bar.

16

MR. REISS:

Exactly, Justice Sotomayor, but

our position does not resurrect the government knowledge

standard that Congress changed in 1986, and it doesn't

do so for some very good reasons.

Court -- that the Congress changed in 1986 didn't allow

things that prompted the congressional change in 1986.

25

First of all, the

That was one of the major

Secondly, and it's clear from the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

legislative history in the Senate report, one of the

2

primary concerns of Congress in enacting the statute in

3

1986 was the fact that there was a sense that government

4

employees themselves who were knowledgeable about

5

potential contracting fraud were not coming forward.

6

fact, the Senate report cites a 1983 survey in which 73

7

percent of 5,000 government employees responded they

8

would not come forward with evidence of contractor

9

fraud.

That was a major concern with Congress under the

10

old government knowledge standard, the pre-1986

11

government knowledge standard.

12

employees came forward, the suit would still be barred

13

because the government by definition would have known

14

about the fraud.

Those -- if those

Under the new statute, not only do you have
