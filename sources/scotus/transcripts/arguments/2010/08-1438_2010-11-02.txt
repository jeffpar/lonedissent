ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:

16

By accepting Federal funds for

17

its prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate

18

relief for violations of the Religious Land Use and

19

Institutionalized Persons Act.

20

case is whether that appropriate relief encompasses

21

damages.

22

generally appropriate against a State, the answer would

23

be no relief, not even an injunction, because States

24

ordinarily are not subject even to suit without their

25

consent.

The question in this

If you simply asked what kind of relief is

And so RLUIPA necessarily asks a more precise
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question, and that is what relief is appropriate against

2

a State that has consented to be sued for violations of

3

this sort.

4

appropriate against a State that has consented to be

5

sued for breach of contract.

Damages, for example, are perfectly

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

Now, what would it be,

7

Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a

8

Federal penal institution was not allowing for the

9

religious practices that the act protects?

10

MR. RUSSELL:

In -足

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In a suit under RFRA,

12

could there be -- would damages be an appropriate

13

remedy?

MR. RUSSELL:

In our view they are, although

15

it's a different context, and we recognize that the

16

government disagrees with us on that.

17

the Spending Clause-contract analogy that applies with

18

respect to Spending Clause legislation as RFRA applies

19

to the Federal Government.

20

indications, including for example the long tradition of

21

damages being appropriate relief for the violation of

22

civil rights.

23

We can't point to

But there are other

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, could we back up.

24

You are saying you could get them against the Federal

25

Government too, but the government doesn't think so?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. RUSSELL:

That is our view, although we

2

recognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in

3

that it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and

4

this Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear

5

that damages are traditionally appropriate relief for

6

the violation of any Spending Clause statute.
Of course, there is also a tradition that

7
8

damages are for the violation of civil rights.

Take

9

statutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504

10

of the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has

11

created damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce

12

civil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to

13

suits under such statutes, it has always put them on

14

equal footing with other defendants and subjected them

15

to damages as well.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

But even beyond that -足
But did it use such

language as "appropriate relief"?

18

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, for example -足

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, that's the

20

question.

Our cases say it has to be clear to the State

21

when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be

22

clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to.

23

And in these other cases I think it was clear.

24

think it's clear with simply the word "appropriate

25

relief."
5
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. RUSSELL:

No, we are not saying that the

2

word "appropriate relief" in itself supplies the

3

clarity.

4

court interprets statutes generally, among other things,

5

looking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate

6

relief for a violation of this sort.

7

It's looking at that language and the way the

We do think that Barnes v. Gorman is

8

appropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling

9

Texas what kind of relief is generally thought

10

appropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy

11

violations of a Spending Clause statute.

12

We recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't

13

involve sovereign defendants, but the local governments

14

in that case had the same rights as a State would.

15

just comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the

16

Eleventh Amendment.

17

provisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants

18

to damages suits under Spending Clause legislation

19

without their consent.

20

identical constitutional right with the same clear

21

statement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman.

22

It

That is, both constitutional

And this Court has enforced that

Even more, the contract analogy the Court

23

relied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of

24

the recipients is a State.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
6
Alderson Reporting Company

The contract

Official - Subject to Final Review

analogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of

2

the contract is interpreted against the drafter.
MR. RUSSELL:

3
4

Right?

That would have been true in

Barnes as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Yes.

So to the

6

extent the State is arguing for a restrictive

7

interpretation, it gets at least a little help from the

8

fact that the Federal Government wrote the statute.
MR. RUSSELL:

9

Well, it gets the same amount

10

of help that the local governments got in Barnes, which

11

wasn't enough.

12

apply; so does the remedy.

And Not only does the analogy, I think,
Damages are a quintessential

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

Mr. Russell, the State

17

looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute

18

preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no

19

damages without having a physical injury.

20

the PLRA together with "appropriate relief," PLRA is

21

telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no

22

physical injury.
MR. RUSSELL:

23

So putting

Well, I would say two things

24

about that.

One, keep in mind that the PLRA limitations

25

only apply to incarcerated individuals.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

apply to the people RLUIPA protects in State-run nursing

2

homes or mental health facilities.

3

have been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in

4

some sense by the scope of the PLRA.

5

So Congress wouldn't

In addition, we think that the fact that

6

Congress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit

7

the relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows

8

that Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the

9

relief inappropriate.

It's simply that there is some

10

relief that is otherwise appropriate that will be

11

limited in some circumstances by the PLRA.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in the prison

13

setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because

14

there are not going to be damages anyway?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

No, that's not true, for a

16

couple of reasons.

One, there are many cases involving

17

pecuniary damages.

There is destruction of religious

18

items that won't be subject to the PLRA limitation.

19

There are -- there are cases that give rise

20

to pecuniary claims.

21

religious item, a Bible or something like that.

22

So there is destruction of a

There are also cases in which the violation

23

will result in a physical injury.

24

rendered a damages remedy unimportant.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6
7

MR. RUSSELL:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

And at the very

Does it include punitive

damages?

8

10

Congress, I

Excuse me?
Does it include punitive

damages?
MR. RUSSELL:

The statute, I think, does not

12

in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get

13

traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are

14

not a traditional contract remedy.

15

Beyond that tradition, though, there's also

16

textual cues in the statue itself.

17

them that I would like to focus on.

18

then discuss them.

19

There are three of
I'll list them and

One is the definitions section, which lumps

20

States in together with local governments in the

21

definition of "government."

22

enforcement provision, which specifically allows suits

23

by the United States, but only for the equitable and

24

declaratory relief that the State says is the only thing

25

that's available under appropriate relief.

The second is the Federal

9
Alderson Reporting Company

And finally

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is the fact that the statute separately already

2

authorizes suits for injunctive relief against State

3

officials, making the addition of suits against States

4

effectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief

5

is available against the State.

6

Beginning with the definitions section, this

7

Court recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village

8

that where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined

9

"governmental unit" to include both the United States

10

and a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that

11

"States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the

12

same for immunity purposes."

13

I think the same lesson comes out of the

14

fact that RLUIPA defines "governments" to include not

15

only States, but local governments, and subjects all

16

governments to the same cause of action for the same

17

appropriate relief.

18

clear as it could that there was a definitional

19

equivalence between States and local government.

20

Congress was expressing there as

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah, but -- but, I mean,

21

that means either that the Federal Government -- that

22

the State government is liable for damages just as

23

municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to

24

suit for damages just as the States are.

25

I mean, that -- you don't know which way
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that cuts, do you?
MR. RUSSELL:

2
3

other provisions of the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

4
5

Well, I will point you to

Well, maybe let's talk

about them, then.
MR. RUSSELL:

6

Okay.

One is the fact that,

7

as I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the

8

State agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive

9

relief against State officials in their official

10

capacity.

The only thing that adding States as

11

defendant would accomplish in light of that would simply

12

be a change in the caption of the lawsuit, unless States

13

are subject to some relief that State officials under Ex

14

parte Young are not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Well, except this would

16

be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a

17

constitutional right.

18

couldn't necessarily get an injunction.

So under Ex parte Young they

MR. RUSSELL:

19

Well, I would set aside the

20

question of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own

21

force.

22

government and authorizing suits for appropriate relief

23

against officials, I think everybody agrees that that

24

authorizes suits against the officials for at least

25

injunctive relief.

I think by defining "officials" as a form of

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And then the question is, well, what does it

2

accomplish to also authorize suits against States?

3

I think the obvious answer is it authorizes a damages

4

claim against the State.

5

the State seems to acknowledge that damages are

6

appropriate relief against local governments under this

7

statute.

9

And even in light of Barnes,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

Well, I can conceive of a

case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA

10

consists of a State statute that simply deprives the

11

individual of his rights under RLUIPA.
What State official would you -- would you

12
13

sue?

14

legislature, so it would make sense to have an

15

injunction against the State.

16

And

It seems to me you couldn't sue the State

MR. RUSSELL:

I think it's common in that

17

circumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex

18

parte Young relief, for example, if you have a

19

constitutional claim against the statute, as may very

20

well have happened in the California case, or the

21

governor, I guess.

22

having a State as a defendant is necessary for that

23

purpose here.

24
25

So I don't think that naming -足

In addition, as I mentioned before, I think
even the State acknowledges that damages are appropriate
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relief against local governments, but Congress made

2

clear that when it intended the identity of a party to

3

result in a dramatically different scope of relief, it

4

did so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S.

5

enforcement provision.

6

authorized suits by the United States and had its own

7

remedial provision which provides only for declaratory

8

and injunctive relief.

9

There, Congress specially

And that shows both that Congress didn't

10

expect courts to simply figure out that different kinds

11

of defendants would be subject to different appropriate

12

relief, but also -足

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it argued that a

14

possible purpose of that was to make it clear that the

15

Federal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money

16

that had been given to it?

17

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, the fact -- I would say

18

two things about that.

19

that provision to suits against States.

20

who gets sued by the United States is limited to

21

equitable injunctive relief.

22

One is Congress didn't limit
It's anybody

And that's, again, an example of Congress

23

treating States the same as everybody else.

Whether

24

they are sued by the United States or sued by a private

25

party, it is the same relief.

It's the same remedial

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provision and we think that suggests the same relief.
That provision also kind of -- the language

2
3

of that provision, "injunctive or declaratory relief,"

4

stands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader

5

phrase "appropriate relief" in the general provision.

6

In addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's

7

also worth pointing out that the State had independent

8

notice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the

9

Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress

10

made clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for

11

damages under any statute that -- under a section of any

12

statute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding

13

recipients.

14

And I think the question here boils down to

15

whether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from

16

section 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an

17

example of a statute prohibiting discrimination.

18

if -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at

19

least be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in

20

our view, the two statutes are not distinguishable.

21

Both prohibit both the kind of disparate treatment of

22

similarly-situated individuals that the State

23

acknowledges constitutes discrimination and requires

24

accommodations in some circumstances.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

You addressed the -- the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect of the issue here on persons who are in State

2

institutions other than penal institutions.

3

What would be -- what's the effect of the

4

issue here on land use restrictions?

5

cases in which issues involving land use restrictions

6

are -- are raised in litigation against the State as

7

opposed to a municipality?

8
9

MR. RUSSELL:

Are there many

It's quite rare.

I am aware

of one pending case in Vermont where there is a

10

challenge to a -- a State environmental regulation, but

11

for the most part it isn't.

12

But if this Court were to, you know,

13

section -- the provision that we are talking about here

14

applies to land use as well as to institutionalized

15

persons, and one would ordinarily think that the statute

16

would have the same meaning depending on context.

17

I recognize that the State's basic argument

18

is that the meaning changes depending on who the

19

defendant is, and I suppose if you accept that it could

20

also depend on -- on what provision is being applied.

21

But that's not normally how statutes work.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the answer to

23

Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area,

24

zoning for example, those are mostly cases against

25

municipalities or counties?
15
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. RUSSELL:

That is correct.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. RUSSELL:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Not against the State.

That is correct.
The government is going to

5

tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the

6

Federal Government is different from the standard with

7

respect to the State.

8

they are going to tell us.

9

Do you -- I think that's what

MR. RUSSELL:

Do you agree with that?
No.

I actually don't

10

understand them to be making that argument, either.

11

I know for sure that that's not our position.

12

Court's decision in Barnes I think, for example, is

13

entirely consistent with the Court's recent decisions,

14

including for example in Richlin, where it's made clear

15

that when you are considering the scope of waiver of

16

sovereign immunity, you engage in ordinary statutory

17

interpretation and then the sovereign is respected.

18

at the end of that interpretation the statute remains

19

unclear, you know, certainly the sovereign wins.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the

the States are in need of special protection.

with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the

23

Congress can always -- always change its law.

cases support the idea that -- that heightened clear

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Respondent in this case agrees that when

21

it accepts Federal funds for its correctional system it

22

voluntarily waives its sovereign immunity to private

23

suits in Federal court to enforce RLUIPA, and it is

24

clear under this Court's decisions in cases such as

25

Franklin and Barnes that that voluntary waiver
17
Alderson Reporting Company

encompasses a waiver to suits for money damages.
JUSTICE ALITO:

2

Suppose Congress passes a

3

statute that creates a private right of action against

4

both the Federal Government and against the States and

5

in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief.

Are damages available in the action against the Federal

7

Government as well as the State government?

provision is a Spending Clause provision.

15

Clause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to

16

rebut the presumption somehow -足
JUSTICE ALITO:

17
18
19

This Court has been clear in

And what about the Federal

Government?
MS. HARRINGTON:

In the Federal Government

20

probably not, although this Court has looked to

21

background principles in interpreting words such as

22

"appropriate."

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

What sense does it make?

24

Other than --

I know you are representing a client and

25

so special pleading for your client is -- is to be
18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

expected, but I find that very difficult to accept.

2

"all appropriate relief" includes damages as against the

3

State that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's

4

good for the State should be good for the Federal

5

Government.
MS. HARRINGTON:

6

If

Well, I would say two

7

things.

First, in both cases what you want is a clear

8

statement of an intent to waive the sovereign's

9

immunity, either by the Federal Government or the State

10

government.

11

mind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this

12

Court was construing statutes that did not say anything

13

about what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention

14

remedies whatsoever.

15

And also that it's important to keep in

And so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use

of the phrase "appropriate relief" as we do on the

If you were construing a

State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity,

relief in that statute should be construed the same as

the use of appropriate relief in RFRA.

injunctive nature from relief in damages against the

State.

The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law

2

and in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would

3

give the States notice that they are waiving their

4

immunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give

5

them notice that they are waiving their immunity to

suits for money damages.

If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I

especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I

would read "appropriate relief" not to include monetary

Right.

And again, we are

not relying so much on the use of the phrase

5

"appropriate relief" in the statute.

6

work that does is it affirms that the background

7

presumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper

8

defendants under RLUIPA, which include State

9

governments.

What that -- the

But as this Court said in Barnes, when a -足

10
11

when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is

12

on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the

13

remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant

14

legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally

15

available in suits for breach of contract, and those

16

include compensatory damages and injunctive relief.
Now the State would have this Court turn

17
18

that presumption, in terms of traditional contract

19

rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this

20

Court should hold that the State presumptively waived

21

its immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for

22

damages.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you say about -- I

24

think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is

25

the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the

2

monetary relief, and also there was some legislative

3

history where people testified and told Congress at the

4

time that the word "appropriate" won't encompass

5

monetary relief.

Am I remembering that correctly?

MS. HARRINGTON:

6

Well, I would give you the

7

same answer I just gave, which is that we are not

8

pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase

9

"appropriate relief" in the statute as we are to the

10

Spending Clause context.

And this Court has held that

11

when there is these conditions placed on Federal funds,

12

the recipient of the funds understands when it takes the

13

money that when it intentionally violates the conditions

14

to which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for

15

money damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

But then you're

17

bracketing the State with counties and municipalities.

18

It really comes down to a question -- who decides

19

whether the state fisc is touched.

20

most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can

21

call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you

22

want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so

23

explicitly.

enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money

damages as well as injunctive relief.

Well, this Court has

consistently applied a clear notice requirement to

conditions that Congress places on Federal funds.

4

5

Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. HO

MR. HO:

The phrase "appropriate relief" is

a textbook example of ambiguity, not unmistakable

clarity.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

And that should end the inquiry.
If it is, why is

injunctive relief included at all?

Meaning, what you

10

seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be

11

appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's

injunctive relief or damages?

We agree with the U.S.'s reading of

injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then

21

of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public

FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is

23

more intrusive than the other?

25

MR. HO:

Because future conduct or change

Two answers, Your Honor.

The

traditional line drawing that you see in sovereign
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

immunity is injunctive relief.

Any prospective relief

2

is less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of

3

retrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing.

4

But especially true in this context, because when you

5

talk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from

6

injunctive relief, from an injunction at any time.

7

can simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting

8

the funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't

9

walk away from a damage remedy.

We

the express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to

to do, which is to comply with the substantial burden

14

mandatory under RLUIPA.

15

relief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end

16

the analysis, because after all, the Court is required

17

unmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible

18

inferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful,

robust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the

federal state balance of power, as well as to ensure

Do you see my question?

MR. HO:

I think I do, Your Honor.

First of

19

all, we certainly agree that your premise, which is that

20

context matters, the Court has said specifically

21

appropriate relief can enlarge or contract, it could be

22

mean monetary or it could mean not monetary, so it does

23

depend on context.

24

interesting, we are obviously focused on section 3.

25

I confess that your question is

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know, but isn't it the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same word that governs both?

2

MR. HO:

It is the same word.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it's the same word that

4

governs both and if land cases very often involve claims

5

for money, I would think that would cut against you.

6

But that's why I ask.

7
8
9

MR. HO:

I want to get your response.
Well, we are still looking for

express language in the text.
JUSTICE BREYER:

But there are loads of

10

cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and

11

in those cases context makes it clear.

12

really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems

13

to me to be RFRA.

14

MR. HO:

The only one

RFRA certainly is the direct

15

context from which the words appropriate relief in this

16

statute are drawn.

17

it's prisons, it's anything, RFRA applies to the federal

18

government or any activity under the sun.

And RFRA, of course, is land use,

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. HO:

Uh-huh.

So for that reason alone, I think

21

we might resist the notion that the specific uses of

22

appropriate relief in RLUIPA would somehow provide any

23

sort of change or certainly any expectation that we

24

would have or that Congress would have, for that matter,

25

that the words appropriate relief would take on a new

would be true even in that context.

Certainly anybody

might want money, but when it comes to what Congress has

indicated and what states would expect, I would imagine

that the federal government's biggest interest is in

making sure that states and other recipients use the

money for what it's supposed to be for, comply with the

Our point here is that simply it doesn't

I think they have,

10

both the Petitioner and U.S. have indicated that the

12

states and locals very differently.

14

treats the state and federal government in the same way,

15

in that both enjoy sovereign immunity and included in

16

that are the principles of sovereign immunity, the need

for specific waiver, not just a clear waiver, but

to the remedies.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So now we have three

distinctions.

With respect to land use discrimination,

23

says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind

of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory

25

damages for that.

So the Rehab Act

We have, potentially, compensatory
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

damages for local governments, but not for State or

2

Federal level.
We are chopping up the statute at each

3
4

stage, correct?

We are treating different defendants

5

differently and different claims differently with

6

respect to the relief that's permissible?
MR. HO:

7

That would not be our submission,

If we are talking about the 2000d(7)

provision prohibiting discrimination, then you get the

11

same remedies against a State that you would get against

12

15

damages would not be available even against the City of

And if we were

Our point here is simply that -足

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. HO:

Sure.

Could you explain why?

I think if I were the City

19

of Austin, I would make three arguments.

One, the words

20

"appropriate relief" are in the statute.

I think

21

they -- the other one wants to read this as surplusage.

22

We would think that the words "appropriate relief"

23

should do something, and we note that there were several

24

justices who dissented in West v. Gibson, noting that

25

the words "appropriate relief" seemed to indicate
33
Alderson Reporting Company

equitable discretion, or discretion, and therefore

2

equitable relief.
In addition, we will note that the words

But equity permits money

Equity permits money as well.
MR. HO:

In some limited formats, but it

8

wouldn't be compensatory damages in the sense that we

9

are talking about in this case.

10

An additional indication would be the fact

11

that the words "appropriate relief" aren't just attached

12

to the claim.

13

And of course it makes no sense to say that you can get

14

money damages by asserting RLUIPA as a defense.

15

It's attached to both claim or defense.

So for all those reasons, the City of Austin

16

might actually have a good case that damages aren't

17

available even against them.

18

matter for our case, because the whole point is if the

Sotomayor's question about Ex parte Young.

I think you

were exactly right that Ex parte -- that our reading

isn't in any way redundant with Ex parte Young, but I

want to note an additional reason why we are not

redundant.
We need to confirm, Congress needed to

confirm, that there was in fact a privately enforceable

right, and that's why our reading in no way renders the

Ex parte Young concept redundant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

What do you do with the

20

practical problem that's been brought up that if a State

21

is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer

22

the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate?

23

the only way that the State is going to take its

24

obligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory

damages?

MR. HO:

If a prisoner is transferred,

released, or the State simply changes its mind and gives

situations, the prisoner is no longer suffering from the

That's why this Court's

Once the prisoner -- once Mr. Sossamon agreed with

abandoned that policy, before litigation was even filed.

18

With respect to the U.S. cause of action

20

has to mean damages, because otherwise just take that

21

declaratory or injunctive relief language and put it

22

into the private cause of action.

23

argument doesn't work is because these are two

fundamentally different provisions.

again, if you can imagine sticking in the words

13

Let's look at the ones that don't.
There is some where it's pretty hard to do

it because it's in a heading called "injunction," and

that's obvious.

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Assuming the

I think there are

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the

2

simplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between

3

section 2 of RLUIPA and section 3.
Section 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four

4
5

provisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all

6

of them have the word discrimination and more

7

importantly turn on the concept of discrimination.

8

discrimination is an element of a cause of action under

9

section 2, or under any of the four provisions

enumerated.
By contrast section 3 is not.

You can have

discrimination as -- as part of your fact background if

13

you want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with

14

whether have you a valid section 3 claim or not.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you have already

your friend on the other side of the case is that with

inasmuch as the Spending Clause could be used to impose

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. RUSSELL:

Thank you.

20

Nearly every argument the state made here

21

today could have been made by the local governments in

22

Barnes.

23

like appropriate relief is too unclear, to the assertion

24

that they were not on notice, that by accepting federal

25

funds they were subjecting themselves to suits.

Ranging from the complaint that the language

45
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's because the local government, like any other

2

state, had the same right to the same clear statement

3

rule.

4

proliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the

5

Pennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause

6

context of local governments applies in exactly the same

7

way to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment

8

and Barnes' Court construed the express private right of

9

action under section 504, which incorporated by

Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a

10

reference the remedies available under Title XI, which

11

this Court construed to authorize appropriate relief.

12

Exactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes.

13

the state for the first time today has suggested that

14

the city of Austin is not bound by Barnes.

15

how they can reach that conclusion.

16

clearly says that the local government is subject to -足

17

and is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear

18

statement in every Spending Clause statute that they are

19

subject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the

20

funds because of the contractual nature of the

21

obligation.

23

I don't see

Barnes quite

That applies.

MR. RUSSELL:

MR. RUSSELL:

2
3

No.

The question in Barnes is

punitive.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Just punitive.

And there

5

is a lot of discussion, the assumption that they were

6

liable for compensatory, but it really wasn't litigated,

7

was it?

8
9

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, the legal principle this

Court adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take

10

it, was not just a principle for that case, but that in

11

general, funding recipients are on notice that they are

12

subject to contract remedies and unless this Court is

13

going to back away from that as a general matter, unless

14

the Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies

15

differently in the Spending Clause context than it does

16

in the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you

17

can come to a different result in this case.

18

Justice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far

19

as I know, there is only one court of appeals case that

20

says the United States is not subject to suits and that

21

was decided six years after RLUIPA was enacted.

22

respect to the IDEA, there are a handful of lower courts

23

decisions that say damages are unavailable.

24

they give reasons that are specific to the IDEA and the

25

fact that that remedial provision is part of the due
47
Alderson Reporting Company

With

Those -足

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

process hearing process there.

In general, damages are

2

the quintessential appropriate relief for violations of

3

civil rights, and there is no reason to think that

4

Congress was creating in RLUIPA a second class civil

5

right that wasn't deserving of a remedy that Congress

6

has provided even against states in every other context.

7

With respect to the state's belief that the Eleventh

8

Amendment somehow prefers injunctions over damages

9

remedies, as counsel for the United States pointed out,

10

the Eleventh Amendment is no basis for that.

11

injunctions and damages as equally offensive to state

12

sovereignty, and in fact, particularly in RLUIPA, where

13

damages are often capped significantly by the PLRA, the

14

concern really ought to be on the states by injunctive

15

relief, which will frequently have a much more

16

significant effect on the public FISC than a small

17

damages award.

18

It treats

And finally with the state's argument that

19

the words appropriate relief are too inherently

20

ambiguous to meet any clear statement.

21

rejected that kind of argument in West where it

22

construed appropriate remedy to encompass a damages

23

remedy by engaging an ordinary statutory interpretation,

24

which is entirely appropriate in this context.

25

Court has repeatedly in cases like Ruckelshaus, for
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, this Court

This

example, like Richlin, relied on how statutes apply with

immunity.
