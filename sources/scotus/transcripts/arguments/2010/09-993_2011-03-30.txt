CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 09-993, Pliva,

5

Incorporated v. Mensing, and the consolidated cases.

Mr. Lefkowitz.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case involves the ordinary operation of

11
12

the Supremacy Clause.

13

Hatch-Waxman's plain text requires generic drugs to have

14

the same warnings as their brand-name equivalents, so

15

State law can't require generic drugs to use different

16

warnings.

17

comply with a Federal duty to be the same and a State

18

duty to be different.

19

As the government agrees,

After all, generics can't simultaneously

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that makes a

20

lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that

21

seems to cut the other way.

22

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth

23

decision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that

24

Federal law obligates and accommodates the brand

25

manufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regulation, in order to make a warning change, in order

2

to comply with its obligations under 201.57.

3

the government agrees, we don't have the opportunity or

4

the authority to use a CBE regulation change.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

And, as

But you have another -­

6

you have another route, and that's what the government

is telling us:

9

You would not be subject to the State suit.

That you could propose a revision of the

Justice Ginsburg, the

11

government agrees with us that we can't actually change

12

the label.

obligation, or they actually, in -- for the very first

stage, said that there is a -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16
17

What they say is, we could have an

No, it was in the -- at

the cert stage as well.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

18

Well, Your Honor, I didn't

19

read the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty

20

to ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that

21

we have a duty to ask the FDA.

22

a duty that appears in any of their notice and comment

23

rulemaking.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And of course that's not

Can we call this the take

steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of discussion here?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

2
3

Yes, Justice Kennedy, this

is the take-steps.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

It's not clear to me

5

whether you say that that is preempted or just that it

6

was not well-pled.

7

position on that point.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

8
9

I'm not -- I'm not sure of your

Thank you, Justice Kennedy.

We maintain that a claim that under State law a generic

10

company can be liable for not asking the FDA to make a

11

labeling change is preempted under this Court's

12

decisions both in Buckman and in ArkLa, because what

13

the -- what the Court has said is that the disclosure

14

obligations between a Federal agency and a Federally

15

regulated party are inherently Federal in character, and

16

this is not a subject of traditional State tort law.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

17
18

should -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20
21

Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why

Would the -- excuse me,

Justice.
Would the Federally licensed drug

22

manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA

23

for a change?

24
25

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

No, Your Honor, and in fact

that was in part what was -- what came up in the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

briefing in the Wyeth case.

2

didn't have the obligation and couldn't use the CBE, and

3

then Ms. Levine said:

4

asked the FDA to make a change, and the Court didn't

5

need to even address that issue, because the Court found

6

that there actually was a regulation on point that gave

7

the brand manufacturer the ability to change.

9

Well, in that case you could have

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
been.

Wyeth initially said it

But assume there hadn't

Assume there hadn't been such a regulation.

Do

10

you understand it to be the government's position that

11

the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from

12

State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to

13

give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to

14

change those warnings?

15

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Your Honor, I -- I don't see

16

anything in the history, the 27-year history of

17

Hatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said

18

that there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a

19

labeling change.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

There is a

21

legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports

22

of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong.

23

Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the

24

FDA when something's wrong?

25

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Absolutely not, Justice

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

So please describe

3

what the difference between that obligation and the

4

obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's

5

been misbranded.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

6

Under the FDA Regulation

7

314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure

8

obligations.

9

report, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to

Any time a generic learns about an adverse

10

investigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not

11

in compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA

12

has plenary authority to take all sorts of action.

13

But just as the Court said in the Buckman

14

decision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make

15

appropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are

16

hurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be

17

injured and States might otherwise want to compensate

18

them for them, those disclosure obligations are up to

19

the FDA with its discretion to enforce.

20

looked directly to Congress in section 337.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the Court

So what's -- so what's

22

the conflict with State law, meaning you have an

23

obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also

24

have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of

25

adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation

2

because you can go to the -- to the FDA?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

3

Well, first of all, there's

4

a little bit of a difference between reporting all of

5

the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the

6

FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is

7

only for the FDA to make with respect to generic

8

companies.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you contest,

10

Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request?

11

know that you contest your obligation to make that

12

request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and

13

make that request and set a process in motion?

14

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

I

Your Honor, there's no

15

question that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in

16

fact if we had reason to believe that a label was not

17

accurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that.

18

The question is whether or not there's either a Federal

19

obligation or a State duty to do this, and -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if you could go to the

21

FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way:

22

That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to

23

warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense,

24

that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to

25

litigate that preemption defense, the question will be,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA

2

have done?

3

names and generics to change the label?

4

have, you would not have had -- been put in an

5

impossible position.

Would it in fact have required both brand

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

6

And if it would

Your Honor, that is the

7

precise set of issues that this Court addressed both in

8

Buckman and in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could

9

have done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the

10

FDA.

11

FDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes

12

of the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided

13

hypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in

14

an area where the Federal Government, the Federal

15

agency, has exclusive authority.

16

Court said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion

17

of the agency to decide whether to punish and how to

18

punish disclosure.

19

For a State to hold us liable for not asking the

And in Buckman, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Buckman --

20

Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that

21

there's a concern expressed in that case that

22

requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would

23

cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency

24

with proposals and warning revisions, so that there

25

would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

able to process them, and they would become meaningless

2

to the consumers.

3

concern in this case.

That doesn't seem to me to be a

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

4

Well, Your Honor, the

5

government had articulated that proposition in the

6

Buckman case and again several years later in the

7

Warner-Lambert case.

8

different position here.

Obviously, they're taking a

But I would submit, Your Honor, that what

9
10

lay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the

11

relationship, the disclosures, between the Federal

12

agency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal

13

and States simply don't have a business trying to

14

enforce those obligations, because that does take away

15

from the authority and the discretion.

16

looked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended

17

that violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal

18

Government.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the Court

The Federal agency says

20

that these suits complement, they're not at odds with,

21

the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers

22

an incentive to come forward.

23

making sure that only safe drugs are marketed.

24

from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency

25

responsible says, this helps us; it encourages

Everyone is interested in

Alderson Reporting Company

So, far

Official - Subject to Final Review

manufacturers to report.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

2

Well, we know from the

3

current FDA database that there were over 1600 requests

4

for labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on,

5

and that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth.

6

are far more generic manufacturers who would be burdened

7

by this new obligation.

9

But, Your Honor, I would -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

And there

Is -- is there any

breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic

10

and how many from branded?

11

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Your Honor, almost all of

12

them I would believe are from branded manufacturers,

13

because generic manufacturers until the briefing in this

14

Court have never believed that they have any obligation

15

to ask the FDA.
In fact, interestingly, the FDA has

16
17

addressed what happens in the marketplace when a brand

18

exits the market and the only drugs left are the 10 or

19

15 generics.

20

published 52 Federal Register notices -- we cite one of

21

them in our reply brief -- they have said:

22

situation, we will designate one of the generics to be

23

the leader for purposes of establishing the label, and

24

everyone else has to follow.

25

And what the FDA has said, and they have

In such a

But critically, what the FDA has said is:

In those situations, we, the FDA, will tell you when the

label needs to change.
JUSTICE BREYER:

3

So what are you supposed to

4

do if your company happens by chance to come across a

5

very, very high correlation between people who take your

6

generic drug and who get seriously ill?
And now what you know is that nobody else

7
8

has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are;

9

it happened that it was associated, a special group or

10

something.

What are you supposed to do?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

11

Your Honor, we have an

obligation, actually, to provide all of that information

13

to the FDA.

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

24

there's no basis for a State claim for that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, how would it

conflict?

Suppose the State said:

Here is what we

4

want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you

5

must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an

6

association, you must revise your warning.

7

understand you can't do that without FDA approval.

8

as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you

9

come across this serious problem you have to tell the

Now, we
But

10

FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it.

11

Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that

12

law would conflict with?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

13

I think that law, Your

14

Honor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and

15

the ArkLa principles.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

I thought you said you had

to tell the FDA about it.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

18

If the -- I understood

19

Justice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not

20

only did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do,

21

but whether we then had some additional duty to ask the

wonder if that's this case.

what they're saying is:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Those are not the

So your argument is that if

we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can

24

make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a

25

serious problem, and you're saying the State has no
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell

2

anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get

3

involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything

4

because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get

5

involved with our failure to try to change the warning

6

because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell

7

them, which we didn't fulfill?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

8
9

Justice Breyer, correct,

because that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what

10

happened was an individual was injured because the

11

company had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled

12

the agency about the purpose of marketing these bone

13

screws.

14

protecting and providing a remedy to that consumer, a

15

State interest in ensuring accurate disclosures to the

16

government, and in fact an allegation that had there

17

been accurate disclosures to the government, the FDA

18

would have made a different safety and labeling

19

determination.

Clearly there was a State interest in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

So you say that if the

21

claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly,

22

that claim could be brought?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

23
24
25

Not in a State court, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
16
Alderson Reporting Company

To disclose -- I'm

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sorry.

To disclose to the FDA?

2

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Correct.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

To disclose to the FDA.
A claim, Your Honor, of

5

disclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal

6

relationship.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

But you just described

8

Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to

9

tell the FDA the purpose of the screws.

You said that

10

the State -- the State suit would lie because of that

11

failure.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

12

No, I said the State suit --

13

I apologize.

14

State suit would not lie because Buckman preempts that

15

type of lawsuit.

16

situation, misleading to the FDA, failure to disclose

17

what the FDA requires you to disclose, there is no State

18

cause of action because this is a uniquely Federal area

19

and States can't supplant the FDA in its enforcement

20

discretion.

21

I meant to say and I thought I said the

Buckman says even in that terrible

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think

22

what the Respondents would say is that you are

23

mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into

24

something that it's not.

25

state failure to warn claim.

Their complaint is a standard
Now, you have a preemption

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense

2

there's going to be questions about your disclosure

3

obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in

4

a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's

5

in a fundamentally different posture than the one that

6

you're suggesting.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

7

Justice Kagan, I would agree

8

with you that what they pled below was a traditional

9

failure to warn.

A failure to warn claim means you did

10

not warn the public in the way that we think under State

11

law you should have.

12

through the FDA has said a brand manufacturer ultimately

13

is responsible for the warnings it issues and therefore

14

can change the warning and therefore can be held liable,

15

we don't have -- and the government agrees with us -- we

16

don't have any mechanism under law to change the

17

warnings.

18

failure to warn claim, it has to be preempted under

19

simple Supremacy Clause principles.

20

And whereas in Wyeth the Congress

So to the extent this is a traditional

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I agree that you don't

21

have any ability yourself to change the warning, but

22

here's what the FDA has said.

23

ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA

24

applicant -- believes new safety information should be

25

added to a product's labeling, presumably because

The FDA has said if an

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they've gotten information that suggests that the

2

product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the

3

FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for

4

the generic and listed drugs should be revised.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

5

Your Honor, that is exactly

6

what the FDA says.

They point for that to a preamble in

7

1992 to a rulemaking that didn't address the relevant

8

201.57 regulation, a preamble that was issued without

9

notice and comment rulemaking, and a preamble that

10

doesn't actually impose a duty.

It says if,

11

subjunctively, we believe that there should be a label

12

change, we should do something, we should ask the FDA.

13

Not we must, not we shall.
And even then it said:

14

at issue during the relevant time period here, in 2000

But what

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress specifically said is that a generic has to bear

2

the same label, and it's because they do have different

3

purposes, different functions.

4

whenever there is a brand drug on the market that no

5

longer is protected by its patent monopoly but has been

6

selling for $10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics

7

selling for pennies for the pill, and they've given

8

branded and generics different obligations.

9

Congress said that

And the different obligations are seen most

10

clearly through the prism of the Wyeth case.

The Wyeth

11

case was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this

12

Court found that the brand company had the ability, had

13

the obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually

14

change the label, whereas here what the FDA has said

15

time and time again is:

16

generic has to change the label, because we don't assume

17

that the generics are going to know when the label

18

should change because they don't have the same basis of

19

clinical testing and results.

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Your Honor, I don't know

3

whether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold

4

differently in a case where the generic at issue was an

5

authorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand

6

company that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety

7

testing and might have a different basis for assessing

8

the occasional adverse reports that they get.

9

But, again, the keys to understanding the -­

10

the generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse

11

reports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the

12

doctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off

13

the box that says a generic can be issued.

14

comes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor

15

has no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

The central issue in this case is that

Petitioners, in the face of considerable information

that the warnings on their products were inadequate, did

nothing.

5

they -- no matter how much they know, no matter how

of the things this Court noted in Levine is that even

10

under the CBE process, the ultimate decision about

11

whether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not

12

with the manufacturer.

13

Levine was that the primary responsibility for labeling

14

rested with the manufacturer, not with the agency,

16

that the agency has the right to review and can reject a

The -- the fundamental issue in

The -- what was at the core and what this

Court cited, although the -- the number has changed in

Wyeth v. Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR

201.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they

renumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be

23

revised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an

24

association of a serious hazard with the drug.

25

The government says, and the regulatory

It's -- well, as this Court

said in Levine, the FDA has 11,000 drugs it needs to

monitor and stay on top of, and it doesn't have the

12

resources necessary to pay attention to every adverse

13

event report it gets and every report that is published

14

in the scientific literature.

15

manufacturers bear the primary responsibility is because

they -- they need to trigger the FDA's focus on a

particular issue here.

available since the mid '90s.

The reason that

Your basic argument, I'm

other things in the -- and do their best to change the

So if your theory of

the case is accepted, this is what will happen:

time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident

report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will

be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We

me that it may significantly increase the costs for

of the objectives of the statute, which was to provide

duty here derives from the misbranding provisions.

part of the defense for the defendant to prove that -­

And in our view it's not preempted if the

standard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Well, but it's

12

not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling

change.

14

thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't

revise the labeling from the branded one.

It says labeling shall be revised, and the one

It can't revise the labeling,

want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public

health.

3

So what's wrong with that argument?

4

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Justice Sotomayor,

5

respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're

6

claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of

7

impossibility preemption.

8

government's brief makes clear we had no ability to

9

warn.

We couldn't warn, and the

What the government is now doing is it's

10
11

taking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word

12

"ask" in it.

13

revise because it's a regulation written for brand

14

manufacturers that have the CBE option available to

15

them, and they are then trying to incorporate the words

16

"duty to ask" through this brief without, as Justice

17

Alito says, taking into any account through notice and

18

comment rulemaking the effect of this.

19

It actually says "revise."

And it says

Well, we know that there are over 1,600

20

requests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now,

21

650 of them are pending for more than 6 months.

22

the relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only

23

would we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would

24

have had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to

25

the FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to
55
Alderson Reporting Company

And at

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

change, so we would have had to make the request, the

2

FDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and

3

then we would have had to follow.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you

5

had asked, you would be in a different situation.

6

you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was

7

negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we

8

can right now.

9

in fact, have not done all you can right now to change

10
11

But you're not in that situation.

If

You,

the label because you never wrote that letter.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Your Honor, and again just

12

to pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and

13

Justice Scalia said, we have done everything we are

14

required to do, which is to provide all of the

15

information about adverse reports that we have and all

16

of the results of our investigations to the government.

17

And if the government wants to impose a new duty through

18

notice and comment rulemaking saying, and now we have a

19

duty to ask for a label change, in addition -­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government is taking

21

the position that there's no clash between the

22

government, the State, and Federal law.

23

that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you

24

don't file this law.

25

question is preemption.

It's not saying

Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you

2

have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if

3

either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not

4

going to change the label?

5

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Your Honor, Buckman makes

6

very clear that a State trying to regulate disclosure

7

obligations to the Federal Government is simply off

8

limits, and in fact -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

The -- the -- Buckman was

10

about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought

11

under State law for fraud on a Federal agency.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

12

Your Honor, it was a case

13

brought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the

14

company had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the

15

FDA.

16

point -­

It's the same thing here, and I just want to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree

18

with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the

19

government's position?

20

saying that there was an obligation on the part of the

21

generics to propose changes.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

22
23
24
25

I thought the government was

Absolutely.

What they are

saying -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Otherwise, the government

would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I
57

2

don't think they're saying that.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Well, in a sense the

3

government is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose

4

changes is a -- is a very fine distinction.

5

what the government is now saying is they are reading a

6

regulation that they've always interpreted as being only

7

applicable to brand companies and saying now it's

8

applicable to their companies and it incorporates new

9

language that says not just revise but ask.
