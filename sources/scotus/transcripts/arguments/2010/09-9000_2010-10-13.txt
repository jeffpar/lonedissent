CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 09-9000, Skinner v. Switzer.
Mr. Owen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OWEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court today and the

11

only question litigated to decision in the courts below

12

is whether a prisoner's claim that seeks only access to

13

evidence for DNA testing may be brought in Federal court

14

under the Civil Rights Act.

15

The Fifth Circuit summarily answered that

16

question "no," adhering to its long-standing view that

17

any Federal claim that might conceivably set the stage

18

for a subsequent collateral attack, however removed in

19

time, must itself be brought via habeas.

20

clearly cannot be squared with the decisions of this

21

Court, especially since Wilkinson v. Dotson, that the

22

Court should reverse and remand.

23
24
25

That rule so

I'd like to begin by describing the contours
of the Heck rule, and -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you about -­

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Wilkinson was a parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't

2

touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one

3

does.

4

So the cases are distinguishable on that basis.
MR. OWEN:

I -- Justice Ginsburg, the reason

5

that we argue our case does not touch the conviction is

6

that the relief that we are seeking, to have access to

7

the evidence for testing, if we won, if we win in

8

district court and we get that access, it does not

9

necessarily imply -- which is the language this Court

10

used in Heck and repeated in Dotson -- that the

11

conviction is lawfully invalid.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I understand that

13

argument, but there is the distinction of the type of

14

case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence

15

were never going to be questioned, only parole

16

eligibility; where here, the discovery that you seek in

17

1983 is not a destination.

18

further litigation that may or may not arise.

19

MR. OWEN:

The destination is to

That's true, Your Honor.

We -­

20

we don't see that as a distinction that compels the

21

conclusion that Dotson isn't the model to follow,

22

because in our view, what Dotson said -- again, the

23

prisoners, as Justice Ginsburg says, were before the

24

court seeking a declaration about parole procedures that

25

Ohio planned to use in their cases.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Those parole

Official

1

procedures had been adopted after those prisoners were

2

sent to prison, and they complained that was an ex post

3

facto violation.

4

And Ohio argued, both in the Sixth Circuit

5

and in this Court, that the fact that these prisoners

6

expected at some point to come back to court armed with

7

a judgment in their favor and seek a reduction in their

8

sentences was enough to conclude that the case should be

9

within the core of habeas.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does seem odd,

11

though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument

12

too much, because you have got planned out what you want

13

to tell us.

14

testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that

15

you asked for a stay.

16

It does seem odd that if your suit for DNA

I mean, if it's not an attack on the

17

sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision

18

not to grant a stay or to grant a stay?

19

irony in your position.

20

MR. OWEN:

It's -- it's an

I think it's an irony -- I -- I

21

accept the Court's point that that -- that that seems

22

unusual, but I think that the reason that the Court's

23

cases, at least as to the relief that we're seeking and

24

not the stay that the Court entered in order to hear

25

this case and decide the question, that the relief we
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are seeking does not necessarily imply the legal

2

invalidity of the conviction.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we don't grant a

4

stay in order to decide a question.

5

because there's a likelihood of success on the merits.

6

And that goes to the sentence.

7

us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence.

8

see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view

9

of the case.

10

MR. OWEN:

We grant a stay

And now you're telling

No, Your Honor.

I don't

I think -- if

11

I -- if I was understood to say that, then I -- let me

12

clarify.

13

I think that our success -- when the Court

14

applies the stay standard, it asks the question:

15

is the likelihood of success on the merits?

16

the merits, for purposes of our lawsuit, means getting

17

access to the evidence.

18
19
20

What

Success on

That's -- that's what it means.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If that's all it means, we

shouldn't have granted a stay.
MR. OWEN:

I don't -- I don't think so, Your

21

Honor, because I think once we had demonstrated that we

22

were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, I

23

think the Court was within, you know, appropriate

24

judgment to -- to make sure that the case didn't become

25

moot by Mr. Skinner's execution, because I do think that
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the demonstration that we had to make was not about

2

whether his ultimate -- or whether, ultimately, he might

3

get relief from his conviction, but whether we had a

4

chance of prevailing on this civil rights claim that

5

asks for access to the evidence.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that disconnects

7

the irreparable harm alleged with respect to the stay

8

and your claim that you now say -- you say now your

9

claim is not going to necessarily affect the -- the

10

sentence.

11

obviously the execution.

12

irreparable harm from your failure to get access to the

13

DNA evidence, unless it's linked to the sentence.

14

The irreparable harm, if I remember, is quite

MR. OWEN:

But it's -- there is no

Your Honor, I -- I guess I don't

15

have a better answer than the one I gave

16

Justice Kennedy, and that is that I think that the stay

17

standard doesn't have to link those two things.

18

that if the Court finds that Mr. Skinner is going to die

19

before he can litigate his claim and it finds he has a

20

reasonable chance of prevailing on that claim, that's

21

sufficient to -- to enter the stay.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think

In the real world, a

23

prisoner who wants access to DNA evidence is interested

24

in overturning his conviction.

25

MR. OWEN:

Absolutely.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. OWEN:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you deny that?

No, Your Honor.
And isn't the emergence of

4

the Rooker-Feldman argument in this case an illustration

5

of the absurdities that pursuing the 1983 path produces?

6

Because habeas is not subject to claim preclusion, is

7

it?

8

MR. OWEN:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

It's not subject to

Rooker-Feldman?

11
12

No.

MR. OWEN:

No, it's not subject to those,

Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But since you've squeezed

14

this into 1983, now have you to deal with both of those

15

issues.

16

MR. OWEN:

I think that the -- the

17

reason that -- I think the reason the Rooker-Feldman

18

issue has arisen at this juncture in the case is that

19

the pleadings in the district court were not permitted

20

to -- because of the sort of -- the fact that we were

21

dismissed at a very early stage in the process,

22

essentially on the threshold of the case, there was no

23

opportunity to develop in full what the legal arguments

24

are for both sides.

25

I -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Except that at page 18 of

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain

2

your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue

3

arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals'

4

decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be

5

so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying

6

Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights.

7

Correct me if I am wrong, but I think -­

8

MR. OWEN:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

No, that's -­

Rooker-Feldman to a tee.

11

MR. OWEN:

I thought that's

Correct me if I'm wrong.

No, I think, Your Honor, that -­

12

I -- I don't agree about the Court's reading of

13

Rooker-Feldman if you think that -- if the Court

14

believes that that would preclude it.

15

this:

16

in that case, who were unsuccessful lawyers who are,

17

what, a law school graduate and an attorney who was

18

barred outside the District of Columbia, and were trying

19

to get a waiver for a requirement for taking the bar

20

here in the District of Columbia -- they filed a number

21

of claims against the application of that rule by the

22

District of Columbia Court of Appeals in their

23

circumstances.

24
25

And the reason is

In the Feldman case itself, the -- the plaintiffs

But -- and this Court said those claims
can't proceed.

Those claims challenge the application
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the law to the facts.

2

But this Court went on to say in Feldman -­

3

the last paragraph of the opinion says they have also

4

raised other claims, and those claims are that this

5

rule, as authoritatively construed by the District of

6

Columbia Court of Appeals, is -- is unconstitutional.

7

It violates the Constitution.

8

Feldman, those claims may proceed.

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the Court said, in
And -­

Mr. Owen, as I -- as I

read -- I'm sorry.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

What's the

12

rule that's arbitrary and capricious that you're

13

challenging?

14

MR. OWEN:

Your Honor, the rule that we are

15

challenging is that when the Court of Criminal Appeals

16

construed the fault provision of the Texas DNA testing

17

statute in our case, it created a wholesale

18

classification that said everybody who falls into

19

Mr. Skinner's situation who did not ask for testing at

20

trial is forever foreclosed from getting testing.

21

-­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Could you tell me how

23

that's different than what Alaska did in the Osborne

24

case that we upheld; their procedure?

25

was one of the elements of the Alaska rule as well.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

I thought that

Official

1

MR. OWEN:

I think -- I'm sorry.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That if you had an

3

opportunity to ask for it and gave it up, that you lost.

4

So how are we getting to that here?

5

going to get past Osborne here?

6

MR. OWEN:

And how are you

I think in Texas we have -- the

7

difference, I think, Your Honor, is the difference

8

between a substantive due process claim, as I understand

9

it, and a procedural due process claim.

That in Osborne

10

the claim that was being made was that the State was

11

denying a Federal right in denying access on that basis.

12

Our argument is that the Texas -- the Texas

13

statute was enacted to grant, essentially, protection to

14

a class of inmates who were -- inmates who were

15

wrongfully convicted and can prove that with DNA

16

evidence -- and then -- and then interprets that statute

17

in a way that needlessly chops a bunch of those inmates

18

out, and that that's arbitrary, at least to the extent

19

that it doesn't have reference to the specific facts of

20

the case, the likelihood of innocence, the reasons for

21

not doing the testing, and so on.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Osborne expressly

23

considered both procedural due process and substantive

24

due process.

25

MR. OWEN:

But the reason, Your Honor, as
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I -- as I read Osborne, that it did not reach a

2

decision on the procedure, or it didn't -- that it

3

rejected Osborne's procedural due process claim was

4

because he hadn't tried at State court.

5

I mean, that was the premise of Osborne,

6

was he was -- I think the Court's language in Osborne

7

was if he hasn't tried those procedures, he's in no

8

position to complain about them in Federal court,

9

whereas we did try the procedures, and it's precisely

10

that that is the basis for our claim in Federal court.

11

If I -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. OWEN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you -­

I'm sorry.
Are you -- one of the

15

criticisms by your adversary of your proposal to bring

16

these actions via 1983 is a prospect that the courts

17

will be used to collaterally attack convictions by all

18

sorts of due process allegations concerning discovery

19

disputes.

20

you agree with them that that's what is going to happen,

21

or if you don't, why not?

22

Could you address that point, and why either

MR. OWEN:

I don't agree with them, Your

23

Honor, and for a couple of reasons.

24

that experience doesn't suggest that.

25

are asking the Court to adopt for the whole nation has
12
Alderson Reporting Company

First of all is
The rule that we

Official

1

been the rule for some time in six different circuits,

2

and there's no evidence that in those circuits there

3

have been a very large number of prisoners going into

4

court under section 1983 and trying to leverage

5

discovery under the circumstances that are suggested by

6

Respondent's brief.

So that's the practical reason.

7

As a legal -- as a legal reason, I think

8

that our claim turns on the existence of the liberty

9

interest in the State statute for DNA testing that Texas

10

has created, and that there is no statute in Texas for

11

other kinds of general discovery; for example, access to

12

the prosecutor's file, police reports, or other kinds of

13

documents.

14

that.

15

That's not -- there's no legal hook for

Our legal hook is the existence of that DNA

16

testing statute and the existence under State law of

17

opportunities to bring claims of actual innocence after

18

the evidence is tested.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The critical

20

formulation in Heck, "necessarily implies," is a little

21

difficult.

22

verb points the other.

23

strikes me as a little less conclusive than you seem to

24

think.

25

I mean, the adverb points one way and the

MR. OWEN:

And how -- "necessarily implies"

I think -- I think if that word
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were in isolation, Your Honor, there might be more

2

uncertainty about what "implies" means.

3

Court looks at the cases -- looks at Preiser, looks at

4

Heck, looks at Edwards, looks at Nelson, looks at Hill

5

-- what you'll see is the word "necessarily" is in all

6

those cases.

7

it was Nelson; one of the two Florida cases -- the Court

8

italicizes it twice in the same paragraph.

9

But if the

And, in fact, in Hill, I think -- or maybe

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -­

Well, you -- you

10

read "necessarily implies" to mean "conclusively

11

establishes," right?

12

MR. OWEN:

Not that strong, Your Honor.

But

13

to finish, the other answer I was going to say is that

14

in other cases -- I was going to say, "necessarily" is

15

everywhere.

16

Court also -- "implies" is not in all the cases.

17

Dotson, for example, the Court uses the word

18

"demonstrate" -- "necessarily demonstrates" -- that the

19

judgment underlying the custody is invalid.

"Necessarily" is in all the cases.

20

So I think that there is some -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

In

So you are asking

for an expansion of Heck from "necessarily implies" -­

23

MR. OWEN:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

But the

No, I think we are -- I think -­

"demonstrates"?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

-- to

Official

1

MR. OWEN:

No, Your Honor.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that -­

So if "implies"

3

doesn't mean the same as "establish" or "demonstrates,"

4

give me an example of a case where the 1983 claim would

5

not establish innocence but would still be covered by

6

Heck.

7

MR. OWEN:

I think that -- I think Edwards

8

is an example of that, Your Honor, where -- in Edwards,

9

the defendant, the prisoner, was suing in Federal court,

10

alleging that, in his words, the procedures that were

11

used to deny him -- I think it was deny him parole or

12

convict him of disciplinary offenses, but the procedures

13

that had resulted in the disadvantage he was complaining

14

about were unconstitutional.

15

But when you looked at his complaint, what

16

he said was this -- the reason those procedures are

17

unconstitutional is because the decision maker was

18

personally biased against me, which is less a complaint

19

about the procedures and more a complaint about the

20

merits of that adjudication.

21

you credit that, and say, okay, we're going to win,

22

fine, that's what happened, the adjudication was biased

23

against you, that necessarily implies the invalidity of

24

the judgment reached by that procedure.

25

And if you believe it, if

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Necessarily implies

Official

1

or conclusively establishes?

2

MR. OWEN:

I think necessarily -- with bias,

3

perhaps that would be conclusively established, because

4

I think there's no harmlessness test there.

5

that -- at least in an adjudication, there wouldn't be.

6

But I think that "necessarily implies" is all that the

7

Court needs to continue embracing in order to find

8

that -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would you do with

10

the Brady violation?

11

is that more akin to your claim?

12

But I think

Is that a "necessarily implies" or

MR. OWEN:

For a couple of reasons, Your

13

Honor, it's not akin to our claim.

14

Brady is a trial right.

15

that it arises at trial, because sometimes it arises

16

at -- the discovery that makes a Brady claim colorable,

17

you know, arises after trial.

18

have certain evidence when you go to trial so that you

19

can use it in an attempt to get the jury to find you not

20

guilty.

21

First is this:

And I don't mean necessarily

But Brady is a right to

And, therefore, if that right is violated,

22

if you don't get that evidence and it's discovered later

23

that you were denied this stuff that you needed to have

24

a fair trial, that implies the invalidity of the trial

25

judgment, the judgment that results in the custody.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In our case, the judgment that we are

2

challenging is the judgment of the Court of Criminal

3

Appeals denying us DNA testing, which does not in the

4

same way demonstrate or necessarily imply that the

5

custody judgment in our case is legally invalid.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Owen, could I take you

7

back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise?

You

8

said that what you are attacking is the judgment.

9

read your complaint as having an important strand where

I

10

you were not attacking the judicial judgment, but

11

instead were attacking actions of the prosecutor's

12

office, independent of any judgment of the State courts.

13

Are you abandoning that part of your

14

complaint, or are you continuing to maintain it?

15

Because certainly, if you talk about the judgment alone,

16

it at least gets you into Rooker-Feldman territory,

17

whereas if you talk about the prosecutor, it does not.

18

MR. OWEN:

I think, Your Honor, that we -­

19

that we are in the territory of talking about the

20

judgment.

21

earlier that that does not lead inexorably to a

22

Rooker-Feldman bar.

23

And I think for the reasons I've described

But I think that the nature of our claim,

24

which follows from Osborne, what we understood the Court

25

to be recognizing in Osborne, or acknowledging in
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Osborne, is that the State's administration of its DNA

2

testing scheme is where a due process violation might

3

theoretically arise, depending on how it's administered.

4

So I think -­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I don't

6

understand the argument you're making.

7

challenging the constitutionality of the Texas statute?

8

11

MR. OWEN:

Are you

As interpreted in our case, or as

construed, I think is the right -- is the better word.
As -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, "as construed" -- I

12

mean, it's their statute.

13

your brief that -- that they gave it an arbitrary and

14

capricious interpretation.

15

want to interpret it.

16

State statutes because the State Supreme Court

17

interpreted it strangely.

18
19
20

I mean, you say somewhere in

It's up to them how they

We don't -- we don't reinterpret

It seems to me you're either challenging the
statute or -- or you don't belong here.
MR. OWEN:

I think, Your Honor, we are

21

challenging the statute.

And I think once the Texas

22

Court of Criminal Appeals says here is what the default

23

provision means, that is the same thing, for the

24

purposes of this Court's review, as if the legislature

25

had written that in.

innocent.

3

In the former case, do you say that has to
go under habeas, but in the latter it doesn't?

4

MR. OWEN:

I think when we are seeking

5

access to evidence which has never been tested for

6

testing, that could be brought under 1983.

7

I think if the evidence has been tested and

8

test results exist and are known and are exculpatory,

9

that is a -- that's a different case and that's probably

10

habeas, because then it's the fact that the results are

11

known and we know they are exculpatory that does

12

necessarily imply that there's something about the

13

judgment that could be undone.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Owen, you're fitting

15

your case into our decisions about the line between 1983

16

17

anything about that and you looked at what's presented

18

here in a civil case, it seems as though you are

splitting your claim; that is, you want discovery, and

if the discovery is favorable, then you ask for relief

21

from the conviction.

MR. OWEN:

that the whole purpose for seeking this evidence and

pursuing this lawsuit is so that Mr. Skinner can have a

5

meaningful opportunity to pursue the liberty interest he

6

has under State law in trying to secure release based on

7

innocence.

8

leads inexorably to the idea that this lawsuit, which

10

But I don't think that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you have sought

11

habeas?

12

you have sought habeas relief?

13

Is it 1983 is the exclusive relief, or could

MR. OWEN:

I think, Your Honor, that since

14

our allegation is that the Court of Criminal Appeals

15

decision denying us DNA testing, which is not the

16

judgment that results in Mr. Skinner's custody, is the

17

problem -- that's the bad, invalid judgment from our

18

legal theory -- that could not have been brought in a

19

habeas corpus proceeding, because I think that the

20

relief that a Federal habeas court would have available

to itself is limited to release, to accelerating release

2

think that it wouldn't be available in habeas, Your

3

Honor.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, couldn't the habeas

5

court say the conviction was invalid because of the

6

failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which

7

was relevant to the defense and which was

8

unconstitutionally denied?

9

for setting aside the conviction?

10

MR. OWEN:

I

Why wouldn't that be a basis

Your Honor, this Court has never

11

said -- and I know the Court's aware of this; I want to

12

make sure I'm clear on that -- this Court has never said

13

that it would be a constitutional basis for habeas

14

relief if you could demonstrate that, factually, you

15

were not guilty.

16

So that's the claim that would have to be

17

brought in such a Federal habeas.

18

available because this Court has never held that.

19

think, given the constraints of the Federal habeas

20

statute and the requirement of clearly established

21

Federal law from this Court, before a prisoner can get

22

relief, that's a necessary prerequisite for us seeking

that relief.

to raise that in the State court, and now you're

9

retrying what the -- what the State court did decide.

10

The problem is Rooker-Feldman.

MR. OWEN:

That's -­
I

I think to the extent, Your

11

Honor, that the question goes to the opportunity that we

12

had to raise this issue in State court, that's a

13

preclusion issue, and there may be preclusion issues

14

back in the district court.

15

whether or not this claim should have been raised in

State court.

17

We may have a dogfight over

But that's not the Rooker-Feldman question,

statutes violate due process or don't.

To decide this case, the Court only needs to

complaint.

20

Good morning, Chief Justice

First is paragraph 33 of Mr. Skinner's

That complaint, that statement of his

21

complaint clearly alleges against Ms. Skinner -- Ms.

22

Switzer herself that she has withheld -- and the word he

23

uses is "exculpatory" evidence -- and violated his due

24

process rights through that.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, he says

Official

1

exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he's

2

not guilty.

3

might imply, necessarily imply guilt, but there's a lot

4

of exculpatory evidence that simply is helpful and

5

doesn't mean it will demonstrate.

6

There's a lot of exculpatory evidence that

MR. COLEMAN:

He says it could.

There -- there are two points

7

in response to that, Chief Justice Roberts, and the

8

first is that this is the classic statement of a Brady

9

claim.

When you file a Brady claim, you don't know

10

exactly what it is and whether it will definitely be

11

exculpatory or not.

12

makes you think that it would be, and you're able to -­

13

You have learned information that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The substantive right in

14

Brady was to have that material at trial, so that it is

15

-- that's the substantive constitutional right.

16

the substantive right that's been identified in Osborne

17

is the liberty interest created by State law.

the same.

20

Here

And that

So it's not quite

It's not comparable.
MR. COLEMAN:

I'm not -- I'm not saying that

21

legally that there isn't some difference to be made from

22

Osborne.

23

you could bring a Brady claim.

24

language of the text of his complaint is a Brady

25

allegation, and at page 19, footnote 6 of his own brief,

Osborne rejected the substantive claim that
What I'm saying is the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he acknowledges that Brady claims have to be brought in

2

habeas and is left simply arguing that, one, that I can

3

describe to the Court a different theory of my

4

complaint, or that regardless of how I describe the

5

complaint, I can break out the discovery aspects of that

6

complaint and do it under 1983 and not in habeas.

7

part of the problem with that -­

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

To -- to win a Brady claim

in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just

10

that the -- that it was withheld, but that it was,

11

indeed, exculpatory and could have affected the outcome

12

of the trial.

13

No?

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes.

But that claim -- that

14

showing is to be made, if at all, in habeas.

15

the opportunity -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And he has

But he doesn't have to make

17

that showing here.

18

says distinguishes this case from habeas.

19

you would have to show that, indeed, it would justify a

20

different outcome in the trial, whereas here he says I

21

don't have to show that; I just want the evidence.

22

I mean, that's -- that's what he

MR. COLEMAN:

In habeas,

There is some ambiguity.

23

not sure I fully understand what you mean by "here."

What

before the Court today and says I'm going to show are -­

That's what he is going to

do with it.

5

need to show that in order to be entitled to -- to the

6

relief I'm asking for, whereas he would have to say that

7

in habeas.

8
9

But he doesn't -- he doesn't say that I

MR. COLEMAN:

I disagree.

With respect to

the relief that he is ultimately seeking, the question

10

is -- if you're saying that the 1983 suit is simply a

11

retrying of the article 64 proceeding, then I -- I would

12

have to concede that article 64 does not require the

13

same showing as a habeas claim.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

But part of the -­

Well, aren't -- aren't

15

the -- the exculpatory nature of the evidence and its

16

materiality elements of the Brady claim itself?

17

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, as -- as the Court and

18

your concurring opinion in Osborne made clear, that -­

19

that "exculpatory" is really defined as demonstrating

20

that you're innocent and that it's material.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree think that sounds

22

like -- I would interpret his complaint as what he wants

23

is the DNA.

24

doesn't know that till he gets it.

25

He thinks it's going to be exculpatory.

So look at Dotson.

He

Dotson says that you go

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

into habeas if winning -- i.e., getting the DNA -- would

2

necessarily spell speedier release.

3

I'm reading to you from Justice Scalia's concurrence

4

where he quotes my majority with great praise.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. COLEMAN:

End of the matter.

Justice Scalia -- Justice

7

Scalia also makes the point at the end of his Dotson

8

concurrence that the question -- the real question is

9

whether you could make out this type of claim or this -­

10

make out this type of proceeding in habeas.

11

Preiser and Heck -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ultimately,

No, not whether you -- what

13

he's worried about -- he can speak for himself -- but as

14

I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win

15

and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed

16

into habeas which don't belong there.

17

true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he

18

has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or

19

something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to

20

you is the test.

21

And that may be a

And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA

22

does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all

23

depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows.

24

isn't that end of the matter?

25

MR. COLEMAN:

So why

Because I disagree that the
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

two words "necessarily implies" are in fact sort of the

2

end of the battle and the end of the test.

3

As Justice Ginsburg noted earlier in the

4

argument, the Court has dealt with these issues in a -­

5

in a variety of cases, most of them being prison

6

disciplinary or parole-type proceedings.

7

cases, the Court is trying to define the outer bounds,

8

ultimately, of what we're going to say Preiser/Heck

9

required to be brought in habeas and what may be

10

brought.

11

first, Preiser and Heck make -­

12

And in those

A couple of boundaries on those rules, but

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Coleman, if you could

13

answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two

14

phrases, "necessarily imply the invalidity of the

15

conviction" and "necessarily spell speedier release";

16

and either you think that your case fits one of those or

17

both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon

18

that standard.

19

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't think that that's

20

true.

21

recognized, an article 64 proceeding is a motion in the

22

criminal case.

23

motion, it is a motion in the criminal case.

24
25

I think that what the Court has always

If you look at the docket number on the

What "necessarily implies" has always been
used for is defining the outer bounds of the rule in

terms of prison disciplinary proceedings, parole, other

things outside the criminal case itself.

3

This is an attack on the -- the criminal

criminal case itself.

7

It's like a rule 60 -­

9

This is a post-conviction motion in the

MR. COLEMAN:

It's not only in the court of

conviction; it's under the docket number of the case.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that's a totally

11

different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what

12

we did do was go through every of these -- every one of

13

the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part

14

the attack, as you say, on prison procedure.

15

cases where the attack on the proceeding would have

16

restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the

17

-- the length of confinement.

18

And those

In those cases where there was a general

19

attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be

20

carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't.

21

suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas.

22

in the case law is this different rule that the rule we

23

just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the

24

case?

25

should I read to show that you were right on that?

the answer to your question, and that is if you make out

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see your point, but I

want to go back to try to understand this.

5

And we have the Dotson point, and you said

6

there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck.

So what

7

Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there

8

wanted the shortening of his term of confinement.

9

wanted good-time credits to be restored.

He

And as we read

10

it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is

11

what made it proper in habeas.

12

hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration

13

of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it

14

would be 1983.

15

But we added that if it

In Heck, the same thing.

They were

16

establishing the basis for a damages claim that

17

necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the

18

conviction.

19

Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not

20

demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal

21

judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in

22

1983.

23

exact principle I described.

24
25

Where that was so, there would be habeas.

So as we read those two cases, they stood for the

Now, you want, perfectly fairly, to say:

Fine.

What is it, in your opinion, precisely, that

we should have the principle of distinguishing the one

1983 from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an

exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in

those three cases:

Dotson, Preiser, Heck?

MR. COLEMAN:

What's your

I -- I think the approach is

habeas corpus claim, then congressional intent and the

habeas statute require that it be brought in habeas.

think that responds -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you are -- you are

They are asking for actual

But you look at those types of cases,

But when you attack the core of the criminal

proceeding itself, what his rule is simply -- is an

attempt to take the two words or the phrase from Dotson

themselves, in the State habeas itself, as long as I

conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we

16

said in Heck and Preiser.

17

what we ought to say is what you propose:

That the test

18

is whether it could be brought in habeas.

You say it

19

could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective

20

assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that

21

habeas.

I'm not sure, however, that

You can bring anything in habeas.

concurrence in Dotson, the question is not whether you

win, but whether you could.

15

exactly what you're angling for there.

16

of the day, I think that there is also a -- a

17

misunderstanding about what article 64 is.

18

But at the end

Skinner treats article 64 as simply:

I

19

asked for evidence, and I get evidence.

20

-- you denied me the DNA.

21

it's a motion, as I mentioned, filed in the criminal

22

case itself, that says:

this additional DNA evidence were known at the time of

trial, then I probably would not have been convicted.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if -- in Heck itself,

12

we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if

13

successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any

14

outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be

15

allowed to proceed.

16

Now, I take it what you're suggesting is we

17

say that sentence is wrong or overstated, that there is

18

another circumstance.

MR. COLEMAN:

Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should

protections -- that is what Preiser and Heck ultimately
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were trying to stop.

2

Heck said we -- the only time we really

3

allow these types of collateral attacks -- and -- and

4

Heck cites Rooker for this very proposition.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I was going to ask if

6

you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument.

7

What -- what is your response to the Petitioner's

8

counsel's explanation of why there is no Rooker here?

9

MR. COLEMAN:

There -- there is a way.

10

When -- when the court said in Osborne you should use

11

these State statutes and you may -- you might have a

12

procedural due process, the court was not saying we are

13

going to create out of whole cloth an entirely new

14

category of procedural due process.

15

You do it like you do any other procedural

16

due process.

17

file -- and again litigation is different from an

18

administrative procedure, which is what Dotson was

19

about.

20

if somebody says, well, there's this prong that you

21

can't meet, and you think it violates due process, you

22

have an obligation to raise it then, and then you have

23

an opportunity, if the court rules against you, to file

24

a cert petition.

25

If you go into the system and you -- you

You're in litigation and you're in court.

And

And if you don't do that, what we do know
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is, from this very limited area, is that the one thing

2

that you can't do is file a Federal 1983 lawsuit saying

3

I think that what the State court did is arbitrary and

4

capricious.

5

And, so, Skinner is asking you to create a

6

1983 lawsuit that is always Rooker-Feldman barred and

7

always preclusion barred, because you're asking the

8

court to declare that the State courts violated your -­

9

the constitutional rights in the way they went about it.

10

And -- and so he's asking you to create a category of

11

1983 suits that runs exactly contrary to Rooker-Feldman

12

and exactly contrary to what Heck said is this

13

overriding interest in ensuring that these types of

14

collateral attacks are brought, if at all, in habeas and

15

not through generalized 1983 lawsuits that don't provide

16

any of the protections that Congress has insisted by

17

statute be applied in these types of suits.

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, first, I don't believe

6

the Court has ever acknowledged the existence of a cause

7

of action for discovery separate and apart from the

8

merits of what you are seeking to do.

9

The merits of what he's seeking to do is to

10

attack his custody.

11

should be brought in habeas.

12

for many reasons, create a cause of action that -- whose

13

sole purpose is to run counter to Rooker-Feldman and

14

whose sole purpose is to avoid the protections of

15

habeas.

16

That is something that can and

20

is, can he bring it, and if he can, it should be subject

to these types of things.

It's that it made no provision for any

MR. OWEN:

The statute gives the

items.

So are you challenging it facially, or are you

MR. OWEN:

Once -- once the Court of

Criminal Appeals construes the statute, that's what the

statute means, and we are challenging that.

If that's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is it about what

they said it means that's unconstitutional?

MR. OWEN:

That it -- that it is not -- that

16

it does not admit of any exceptions and that it doesn't

17

have any reference to the purposes of the statute, the

18

reasoning the testing might not have been sought in a

19

particular case, or the fact, particularly that, in our

20

case, Mr. Skinner at the time of his trial, this -- the

21

postconviction DNA testing statute was still 6 years in

22

the future.

23

of Criminal Appeals portrayed Mr. Skinner as making a

24

choice, that's -- that's not accurate, because he didn't

I'm not quite sure what the date of the

statute's passage, whether it makes any difference,

10

MR. OWEN:

Well, let me then -- I -- I've

11

always felt that it was intuitively, especially unfair

12

to accuse him of laying behind the log when there was no

13

log to lie behind.

14

in responding to your question, Your Honor.

15

is simply that we think that the exception that they

16

crafted in construing the statute or the statute as

17

construed sweeps too broadly.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Owen, if I

understand you correctly in how this understanding of

the claim relates to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, what

2

you are saying is that the statute as construed was

unconstitutional?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

Yes.

the bounds of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine?

7

MR. OWEN:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

And that that falls outside

Yes, Your Honor.
Whereas, if you were saying

that the statute -- that the application of the statute

10

in this particular case was wrongful, that would not

11

fall outside of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine; is that

12

right?

13

MR. OWEN:

That's right, Your Honor, and the

14

comment that was made during Respondent's argument

15

about -- he said we are challenging, in his words, the

16

way the State court went about applying the law to Mr.

Skinner.

That's not what we're challenging.
