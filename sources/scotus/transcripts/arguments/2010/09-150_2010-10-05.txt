ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. PALMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Formality is indeed essential to testimonial

11

utterance.

12

with two related situations:

13

by police officers and questions by 9-1-1 operators.

14

This Court noted that such questioning may often lack

15

the formality essential to testimonial utterance, as

16

officers called to investigate need to know whom they

17

are dealing with in order to assess a situation, the

18

threat to themselves, and the potential danger to

19

possible victims.

20

So said this Court in Davis, which dealt
On-the-scene questioning

The question here is whether those same

21

assessing questions -- what happened, who did it, where

22

did it happen -- asked by police officers who, upon

23

receiving a radio report of a man shot, found a wounded

24

man lying on the ground next to a car at a gas station,

25

bleeding, visibly in pain, and having trouble talking -­

1

were made in a formal context sufficiently similar to a

2

magisterial examination so that the answers by the dying

3

-- by the dying victim are testimonial.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it can't all

5

be the formality of the context.

6

came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I

7

guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was

8

the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the

9

answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same

10

I mean, if the police

lack of formality.

11

MS. PALMER:

Which is where the ongoing

12

emergency test from Davis comes into play.

13

questions need to be -- the primary purpose needs to be

14

to meet an ongoing emergency.

15

Well, under Davis, you said

22

that was how you tested the formality.

If -- the Davis

23

test is a gauge of formality.

24

25

said that that is an indicator that it lacks the

formality.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do we tell that?

3

Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what

4

happened, you'd ask the very same questions.

5

saying the questions are relevant also to securing the

6

situation.

7

you ask if you wanted to find out what happened?

8

was the past -- what were the past events?

9

You're

But what -- what different questions would
What

I mean, I'm trying to understand how you

10

take these questions and say we can put a label on them

11

here that says, well, this is to control an emergency

12

situation versus we want to know what happened

13

historically.

14

MS. PALMER:

Well, I think that what you

15

have to do is look at the -- I mean, obviously, things

16

can have dual purposes and often will.

17

at the primary purpose here.

18

an objective -- what would an objective person

19

viewing this test -­

20
21
22

You need to look

And you said in Davis it's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But whose primary

purpose is it?
I mean, the victim here knew that the

23

incident hadn't happened there.

There was nothing he

24

had to share with the police, because they could see he

25

was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official

1

apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem

2

to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat

3

to him.

4

had gone.

He had driven away.

5
6

Rick didn't know where he

So what's the ongoing emergency to the
victim?

7

MS. PALMER:

Well, I think here -- which is

8

why in Davis you said is the primary purpose of the

9

questioning, is what you look at in Davis.

10

And we're

not asking you to overrule that.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, wait a minute.

12

What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a

13

footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant

14

is what is at issue?

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is -- that is what it

says.

17

MS. PALMER:

What -­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's the -- it's the -­

19

it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the

20

questioner.

21

MS. PALMER:

But the formality indicators

22

that the Court delineated in Davis did not include

23

whether the answers to the questions were for the

24

purpose of establishing past events, but whether the

25

primary purpose of the questions were for those ends.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The -- the question is one of context, not

2

content, as you noticed in -- as you said in Crawford.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in Davis, the

4

issue is why was the declarant talking?

5

trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was

6

seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested.

7

That's how I read the situation.

8
9

What you were

The questions provided context for that.
Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you

10

talking about an event, attempting to get the police to

11

intercede and arrest the person?

12

Isn't that a fair reading of that case?

13

MS. PALMER:

Yes.

And in Davis, you said

14

also that there comes a point where courts can tell when

15

the questioning takes on a different tone and the

16

answers might become testimonial.

17

When the questioning seeks answers that go

18

beyond meeting the emergency, then courts can properly

19

find there's a point where the nontestimonial statements

20

end and the testimonial statements -­

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

In a situation like this, do

22

you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary

23

purpose of the victim was when he responded to the

24

police and said who shot him?

25

You have a man who has just been shot.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official

1

has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and

he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and

he says:

they can respond to an ongoing emergency.

5

also have the purpose of giving them information that

6

could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's

a little bit less my purpose than responding to the

8

ongoing emergency.

9
10

My primary purpose in saying this is so that
No, but I

It seems like it's totally artificial.
MS. PALMER:

Yes.

And I think it -- any

11

time you ask the courts to delve into the subjective

12

intent of someone who is not present and cannot testify

13

and cannot tell you, it necessarily complicates things.

14

And I think it would -­

What possible response to

an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind?

He knows -- he knows that

The only reason he could be giving the name

2

answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my

trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in.

MS. PALMER:

As long as it was not somehow

5

barred by the rules of hearsay, which I believe it would

be.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm confused of

8

what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on.

9

purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the

10

Is it the

declarants?

11

We say the statements are testimonial when

12

the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no

13

such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of

14

the interrogation is to establish or prove past events.

15

The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the

16

interrogation, which seems to be the question of what

17

the police thought, not what the -- the person dying

18

thought.

19

MS. PALMER:

That's correct.

And I

20

understand there is the footnote stating that,

21

obviously, the declarant's statements are at issue.

22

there were no declarant, then -­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MS. PALMER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If

Yes, I mean -­

-- there wouldn't be an issue.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

But what the

Official

1

footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the

2

footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the

3

declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question,

4

that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.

5

So which -- I guess, which is it?

6

MS. PALMER:

Well, I think what happens is

7

the -- the interrogator's statements are not what are

8

going to be determined to be testimonial or

9

nontestimonial.

They provide a glimpse into the context

10

so we can determine whether those statements that are at

11

issue are testimonial or nontestimonial.

12

way to determine the formality of the situation.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are one

One way to evaluate those

14

statements is what they are made in response to.

15

they are made in response to a certain type of police

16

inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial.

17

another kind -- you know, are you dying?

18

likely not to be testimonial.

statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether

they are testimonial or not.

saying the record would have been available to check -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, of course, Crawford

rejects reliability as a criteria.
MS. PALMER:

Yes.

So our position here

10

simply is that you cannot evaluate an ongoing emergency

11

from hindsight.

12

When police -- you know, arrive on a scene

13

and find a wounded man bleeding, they don't know the

14

circumstances until they can find out what happened, who

15

did it, and where did it happen, and try to assess the

16

risk of harm, as you said in Davis, to themselves, to

17

the victim, and to others.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what does that have

19

to do -- we're back to the reliability test, really,

20

because they didn't do anything wrong.

24

Was the statement made under circumstances that would

2

suggest an intent to testify?

3

getting at, isn't it?

4

MS. PALMER:

No.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's really what you're

No.
Well, you are, because

6

you're trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing

7

emergency that suggests that in those situations,

8

whatever the person is saying is okay because it was

9

done to assess an emergency situation and not done for

10

purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of

11

catching somebody.

12

MS. PALMER:

Which is what this Court said

13

in Davis, and said that that was not related to

14

reliability but to formality there, and that that was

15

not a formal thing akin to magisterial examinations.

16

We're not trying to question or in any way

17

change the test already set forth by this Court in

18

Davis.

19

with the application by the lower court of that test

20

here and the limitation it put on it.

21

We agree with that test.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We simply disagree

So are you saying that

22

the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be

23

in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent

24

emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what

25

had -- the nature of the crime?
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. PALMER:

We're not saying that any time

2

there is a perpetrator at large, there is automatically

3

an ongoing emergency until that person is caught.

4

What we are saying is that preliminary

5

inquiries on the scene to try to determine who the

6

perpetrator is and where it might be would be -- would

7

be nontestimonial -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For all crimes, or only

for shooting crimes or knifing crimes?

10

What kinds of crimes would qualify?

11

MS. PALMER:

For explosions?

I think, obviously, violent

12

crimes raise ongoing emergencies, emergencies to

13

which -- more than others.

14

in which it would apply to other crimes.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There could also be contexts

So at least whenever the

16

police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a

17

violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could

18

plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not

19

still nearby, and that testimony will always be

20

admissible?

21

MS. PALMER:

It is preliminary questions

22

designed to assess the risk to themselves, the public,

23

the risk."

These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk.

4

5

to happen in future cases.

6

You don't know what they're designed to do.

And that's what is going

And you're saying, whenever policemen come

7

upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it,

8

what's his name, all of that will always be admissible

9

because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?

10

MS. PALMER:

I think if the context shows

11

that's the primary purpose, then, yes, that will often

12

be the case.

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you mean?

How

could it possibly be admissible?

15

First, there has to be a degree of

16

formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the

17

kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay

18

tests.

19

it is not admissible.

So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule,

20
21

MS. PALMER:

Well, here, for instance, it

was admitted as excited utterance.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

exceptions.

Well, of course, there are

whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State

2

law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception -­

3

would permit it in.

4

So the answer is no, it's not the case that

5

whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him

6

questions, it's going to be admissible.

The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether

8

there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon.

a violent crime is excited.

It depends.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As we understand the rule of

17

Davis v. Washington, it is a rule that focuses on the

18

primary purpose behind police interrogation, because

19

it's designed for a particular purpose:

20

a comprehensive definition of the term "testimonial,"

21

but rather to identify those statements that are

22

testimonial because they are made in response to police

23

interrogation.

24
25

Not to provide

When the objective primary purpose of that
interrogation is to enable police to meet an ongoing

possible prosecution, the statements that are given in

response to that interrogation are nontestimonial.

And you can say these police -- these

10

policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future

11

prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter

12

was and where he was so they could go get him.

13

MS. KRUGER:

Just -- just

I think that what would qualify

under the Davis test is if police need to apprehend the

Alderson Reporting Company

person, not for purposes of bringing the person into the

2

criminal justice system, but rather to neutralize an

deadly harm on multiple victims in a short period of

18

alleged perpetrators -­

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets

That's always going to be the

And you may as well take

3

I think it's actually very

It may very well have been that the

4

subjective purpose of the 9-1-1 operator was also to

5

bring the perpetrator in that case to justice.

6

Court, I think quite properly, recognized that in an

7

emergency situation, the attention of both law

8

enforcement and the declarant is quite properly going to

9

be focused on dealing with the emergency at hand and is

10

not going to be made of the kind of focused

11

understanding of -­

There's nothing like that here.

It's true that that is a

factual distinction between this case and Davis, but we

don't think that it's one that makes a dispositive legal

difference.

No, they

whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a

emphasize that what we're arguing for is not a rule that

large, as long as he is at large, any questions that

25

police ask of -- of potential people who have
25
Alderson Reporting Company

information about the crime will necessarily be

2

nontestimonial.

3

Our argument is a far narrower one, and one

4

that we think follows very closely from the principle

5

articulated in Davis, which is when the primary purpose

6

of a police interrogation is to obtain information

7

that's necessary to enable them to meet an ongoing

emergency -­

mitigate the emergency.

8
9

What would be the rationale for admitting
this statement, then?

Is it more reliable?

Because if

10

we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which

11

says reliability is not the key.

12

What is the reason for that?

Is it because

13

the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -­

14

the statements and to ask loaded questions?

15

itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's

16

the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the

17

rationale for the distinction?

18

MS. KRUGER:

That in

We think that the principle

19

that this Court announced in Davis and we're asking the

20

Court to apply again today reflects two principles that

21

underlie the Confrontation Clause as this Court

22

interpreted in Crawford.

23

The first is that testimony is typically

24

characterized by the kind of focused understanding by

25

the declarant that the person is providing information
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for potential use in a future prosecution.

It's -- the

2

petitioner in Davis, I would note, made an argument to

3

this Court that whenever a person calls 9-1-1, they do

4

so with an awareness that the information they provide

5

may be used for prosecutorial purposes.

6

But this Court rejected that argument,

7

because it understood, I think quite rightly, that

8

there's a difference between providing that sort of

9

information to law enforcement with a sort of vague

10

awareness that that might be its potential use, and

11

doing so with a kind of focused understanding that has

12

been characteristic of the testimonial statements this

13

Court has so far identified, like Sylvia Crawford's

14

stationhouse interview in Crawford or Amy Hammon's

15

interview with the police officer from the safety of her

16

kitchen that resulted in the execution of a formal

17

affidavit in the Davis case.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we look to the

19

specific situation?

I mean, one of the officers zeroed

20

in on the victim.

21

anybody was lurking in the bushes.

22

protecting the public, do we take into account that this

23

was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are

24

not likely to be many members of the public around?

25

do we just say you find someone who looks like he has

No one was looking around to see if

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Then, as far as

Or

Official

1

been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter

2

whether the public is around or not, we -- that's

3

enough, the victim of a violent crime can be asked these

4

questions?

5

MS. KRUGER:

To take your first question

6

first, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the trial

7

testimony is not quite as clear on the question of what

8

fears the officers had as I think Respondent has

9

suggested in his brief.

If you look at Joint Appendix

10

page 136, Officer Stuglin testified that he was, in

11

fact, afraid for his safety when he got to the gas

12

station.

13

they left the gas station after EMS arrived, they

14

proceeded immediately to the location of the shooting,

15

the location that Anthony Covington had identified for

16

them.

17

position, they waited for back-up, and they did so

18

because they were afraid that a shooter was in the

19

house, and they wanted to proceed very cautiously in

20

making sure that they neutralized the threat that

21

shooter posed to the public safety, including their own.

22

I would note that all of the officers, when

When they got there, they took a tactical

I think that in examining the exigencies of

23

a situation a court would be justified in looking at the

24

circumstances in which the crime occurred, and could

25

very well take into account the fact that the crime
29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

occurred at 3 o'clock in the morning as opposed to 5

2

o'clock in the afternoon.

3

expect any reasonable police officer to do precisely

what the police officers in this case did, which was

6

with Anthony Covington as an occasion to execute an

affidavit or otherwise engage -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but then you're

saying that the focus is on the police officers.

11

can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects

12

can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your

13

friend is arguing for.

14

out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating

15

officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant?

16

MS. KRUGER:

I still have trouble figuring

I think that the test that the

17

Court set out in Davis is one that focuses on the

18

purpose of the interrogation because of the limited

context in which that -­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER JON VAN HOEK

MR. VAN HOEK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Anthony Covington made his statement to

17

the officers at the gas station, not just once but

18

several times, he reasonably understood that he was

19

providing the police information as to events which had

20

concluded a half hour earlier at a location six blocks

21

away, with an understanding that that information would

22

assist the police in locating, apprehending, and

23

potentially prosecuting the person he felt was

24

responsible for his injury.

Arresting -­
-- involves something like

6

that, if -- what keeps that out?

I mean, assuming that

7

a State law or the Federal Rules of Evidence admit it as

8

an exception to the hearsay rule, why should the

9

Confrontation Clause bar it?

There is not great

10

likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's

11

affidavit, it is going to be introduced per se into the

12

trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would

Perhaps there is another

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now is a good time

to try to jump in, I think.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. VAN HOEK:

Okay.

The reason, Your

11

Honor, that the Confrontation Clause is the

12

fundamental -- part of the fundamental law of the

13

country, and what this Court, I believe, decided in

14

Crawford and then applied to those situations -- similar

15

situations in Davis and Hammon, is that where you have a

16

statement from a witness to a police officer as part of

17

a questioning and that statement is the functional

18

equivalent of testimony that witness would have given

19

had he or she appeared at trial and been subject to

20

cross-examination, then the admission of that statement

21

at trial even under a hearsay exception without

22

cross-examination effectively allows the police to

23

present -­

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But does it mean -- does it

mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -­
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be

2

used at trial?

3

mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the

4

situation?

5

not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand

6

there have been situations where the Court's gone back

7

to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it

8

doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it

9

a little bit.

10

Or it may just happen to turn out?

I

When I looked into history I thought -- I'm

I think that that goal could be open to

us.

11

So I want to know what the basic reason is

12

that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say,

13

an investigation.

14

and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes

15

some statements just generally that help the

16

investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as

17

co-conspiracy, okay?

18

There's an investigation of a crime,

What in the Constitution, what functional

19

principle, is there that says we should keep that out of

20

Court?

21

MR. VAN HOEK:

Because I think what this

22

Court said in Crawford and Davis is that is the primary

23

test.

24

the reliability, the believability, the trustworthiness

25

of that evidence to be evaluated by a jury.

That is what our Constitution requires to allow

Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

all -- all hearsay evidence, despite State or Federal

trustworthiness is sufficient, such as co-confederates,

for now because I'm -- is whether there's any sense to

that.

17

Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many

18

second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended

19

as I have written it.

20

What is the constitutional rationale?

MR. VAN HOEK:

I joined

Well, I would have to say the

21

constitutional justification for that is the reason why

22

the right of confrontation is, isn't it, in the

23

Constitution, where you had a situation in English

24

common law, as we said, where magistrates were allowed

25

to go out, interview witnesses, come into court, and
35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

present their memory, their version, of what the witness

2

said as substantive evidence in a case and the defense

is not allowed to question or talk to the witness -­

5

I'm looking for.

6

Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this

was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial

correct line and why, most importantly why?
MR. VAN HOEK:

I believe this Court in

19

Crawford and Davis correctly established that line, in a

20

situation like this where it is the response of a

21

citizen to questions from a police officer, that you

22

look primarily, as footnote 1 indicates, to the content

23

of that statement.

contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford?
MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, this Court certainly

3

has suggested that in Giles, that a dying declaration

4

might be an exception to Crawford as an exception that

5

existed at the time of the framing.

6

deal with that question in this case because this is not

that, but assume -- assume for the sake of argument that

11

it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying

12

declaration, which the Court has suggested.

13

that tell you about the understanding of the scope of

14

the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth

15

Amendment was adopted?

16

very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be

17

testimonial under the Crawford test.

What does

Because a dying declaration may

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes.

And I think that the

19

dying -- maybe the dying declaration as being in that

20

situation is an indication.

21

dying declaration from all these other hearsay

22

exceptions is that, at the point the statement was made,

23

emergency exception, do you think?

I don't believe so.

I don't

believe that -- that a -- a statement by a witness that

Isn't there a reliability

component that underlies this whether we like it or not?

MR. VAN HOEK:

I don't believe so.

I don't

21

think that the fact that someone calls 911 and makes a

report, whether they're talking about an ongoing

allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this

Well, in -- in this case,

when -- when the initial attempted admission of this

evidence, at the preliminary exam, when it met a hearsay

something that is occurring?

of any statement by the witness alleging that there's

any current, ongoing, imminent danger, if the witness

events, then it's not a showing of -- of an ongoing

that line is dividing what I think of as the

saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it

letter, and they say "bye," and then they walk next door

Roberts, which -- Reynolds was the Mormon case -- which

was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided,

yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it.

if by what you mean is in the past, Crawford examined

quite different from what Justice Breyer now says,

16

MR. VAN HOEK:

But

I -- and as you said,

17

in Crawford this Court looked at that and thought that

18

the protections of the hearsay rule, and the focus under

19

the Roberts standard of whether a statement fell within

20

a firmly established hearsay rule, was not sufficient

21

under the Constitution, under the Confrontation Clause,

to -- to alleviate the fact that there -- there's no

Many -- I mean, like many

far afield from the subject matter before us.

will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford.

3

So I'm really asking about that scope and, in

4

particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or

5

to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping

6

out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a

7

co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent

8

to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited

9

in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.

10

MR. VAN HOEK:

And I

Well, I'd have to go back to

11

my answer that the Confrontation Clause is the primary

12

law of the country, not State hearsay evidentiary rules.

13

Many of the examples -- the co-conspirator -- the

14

co-conspirator exception is not going to be applicable

15

in many cases because those statements aren't made to

16

police officers; they're made between co-conspirators in

17

the course of a conspiracy.

18

requirement.

19

That's the foundational

It's not going to eliminate hearsay rules.

20

Statements made to private citizens, statements made in

21

a lot of different circumstances are still going to be

22

evaluated solely under hearsay rules because they're not

23

going to be defined as testimonial, because they're not

24

the product of police -- police questioning.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm still trying to

3

idea is that the police have to have specific evidence

13

witness has not provided any information to the police

14

indicating that there's an immediate threat, either

15

volunteered to the police or in response to questions

16

from the police saying is there a threat?

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, certainly if the police

2

come on the scene and there's multiple students who have

3

been shot, you would think that if their primary

4

purpose -- if the primary purpose, if you take that as a

5

test, that their primary purpose of questioning the

6

witness is to determine whether there's an emergency,

7

they're going to ask those questions.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would they ask his name?

God, it's really important for us to know, four students

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
They'd say:

Where is he?

Of course that -- of course

16

that's the emergency because how are they going to find

17

the person that they -- that they're looking for if they

18

don't know who it is?

Of course, if they come upon him and he has his gun in

puzzled now as to what you -- when you think there's an

ongoing emergency and when there isn't.

MR. VAN HOEK:

I think there's an ongoing

6

emergency -- that a statement relates -- would become

7

nontestimonial relating to an ongoing emergency when

8

there's some indication from the statement made by the

witness that such -- that there's some immediacy.

emergency.

22

MR. VAN HOEK:

It's -- it's 10 o'clock

You can infer

I don't -- I don't agree.

I

23

don't agree because if that's the case, any report -- as

24

Justice Scalia I think said previously, any report of a

25

past crime certainly raises the potential that a

different than saying, you know, this happened to some

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MS. PALMER:

I'd just like to reiterate that

19

the underlying principle, as this Court has said

20

repeatedly in Crawford and in Davis, is formality, and

21

that's what the purpose of any inquiry should be in

22

looking at -- at the scene, whether there's an emergency

23

or not, or declarant's view or not.

24

to be some emergency.

There has

That's what we've said.

5

MS. PALMER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
Correct?

So the issue

7

here is how do you define that dividing line between

8

emergency and non, when the police officers are just

9

asking questions that by their nature are always going

10

to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try

11

to use whatever is said later?

12

primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying you

13

can't go by what the police officers are asking because

14

they are going to be asking dual motive always.

15

have to look to what the declarant tells you.

16

or she telling you something that suggests an emergency?

That's really the

difference between the two of you, I think.

20

MS. PALMER:

Well, even if -- even if you

21

take that view, that it's the declarant's purpose,

22

objectively viewed, that controls, I think here it's

23

difficult to see how Covington's purpose could have been

24

to provide evidence any more than the 9-1-1 call in

25

Davis.

I think he was in shock from a bleeding wound.

this wasn't even a 9-1-1 call where he sought them.

3

4

not him.

5

They came to him.

You know,

It's not clear who called, but it was

So even taking it from his point of view,

10

you're saying.

wounded.
