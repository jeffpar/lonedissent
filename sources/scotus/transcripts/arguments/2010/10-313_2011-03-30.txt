Michigan Bell, and the consolidated case.

Mr. Bursch.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BURSCH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Interconnection is the lifeblood of local

12

phone competition.

13

the Telecommunications Act, Congress guaranteed that

14

competitors would have interconnection at the location

15

and at the method of their choosing and at TELRIC rates

16

irregardless of market impairment.

17

case is whether that 251(c)(2) obligation encompasses

18

the tens of thousands of existing entrance facilities

19

that even today are interconnecting competitive and

20

incumbent networks.

21

That is why, in section 251(c)(2) of

And the answer --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

(c)(2) at TELRIC rates?

23

MR. BURSCH:

24
25

The question in this

Did you get -- you get

Yes, you do, Your Honor.

You

get (c)(2) and (c)(3) at TELRIC rates.
And so, the answer to the question presented
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is yes, for three reasons:

First, because the FCC says

2

so.

3

and implementing the Act, that conclusion is entitled to

4

deference.

And, as the expert agency charged with interpreting

5

Second, the FCC's conclusion is consistent

6

with the plain text of the statute and the implementing

7

regulations.

8
9

And, third, the FCC's conclusion is
consistent with the policies embodied in the Act,

10

because the practical result of affirming the Sixth

11

Circuit opinion in this case is that a competitive

12

carrier, like Sprint for example, will be forced to

13

either charge its customers more for interconnection or

14

lay tens of thousands of duplicate entrance facility

15

cables, and those are precisely what the Act were

16

designed to prevent.

17

I'd like to start with the Sixth Circuit

18

opinion -- and, specifically, this is at page 20a of the

19

Talk America cert petition appendix -- because this goes

20

to the heart of AT&T's position and the Sixth Circuit's

21

conclusion with respect to the orange plugs and cords

22

analogy.

23

was like a situation where a homeowner had a plug in

24

their garage and a long orange cord extending out to a

25

park, which the court called the entrance facility, and

You'll recall that the Sixth Circuit said this

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then the competitive carrier would be that person in the

2

park.

3

On page 20a of the petition appendix in

4

footnote 9, about halfway down, this is the key flaw in

5

the Sixth Circuit's reasoning:

6

"If you, as the homeowner" -- that's the -- I'm sorry,

7

that's the incumbent -- "had said that they may plug

8

into the surge protector, then the big orange extension

9

cord is just an 'entrance facility.'

The Sixth Circuit says,

But, if you had

10

said they must plug into the big orange extension cord,

11

then the big orange extension cord becomes the

12

'interconnection facility' and, consequently, the park

13

goers" -- the competitors -- "may plug into it."

14

The problem with this is that the Sixth

15

Circuit was wrong in that the incumbent doesn't get to

16

choose where the point of connection is.

17

and the regulations and the FCC make clear it's the

18

competitor that gets to choose.

19

chooses the end of the extension cord where it connects

20

to the CLEC network in the park, then even the Sixth

21

Circuit agrees with us and the Seventh, Eighth, and

22

Ninth Circuits that the entrance facility is the

23

interconnection facility.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The statute

So, if the competitor

I have just one small

question on that.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose that there are two

3

competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each

4

of them wants to connect at a different point and in a

5

different way.

6

they're technically feasible?

7

Must the incumbent accommodate both if

MR. BURSCH:

Justice Kennedy, the answer is

8

yes.

9

opportunity to choose the point and the method, all at

10
11

The statute gives the competitive carrier the

TELRIC rates.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Doesn't it say something

12

about feasible?

13

free choice entirely.

14

That the -- the interconnection doesn't have to be put

15

just anyplace if it's not feasible or it's undue expense

16

or something to that effect.

17

It -- it doesn't -- it doesn't give

MR. BURSCH:

It says -- what are the words?

Justice Ginsburg, the statute

18

and the regulations make clear that it must be

19

technically feasible, but there is an almost

20

irrebuttable presumption that when there are already

21

facilities in place performing that function, that is

22

technically feasible.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- you want the

24

incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and

25

extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And what they say is, no, you -- you bring your

2

switching equipment here; we'll -- we'll allow you to

3

connect at, you know, the end of our facilities; but, by

4

God, you -- you make -- you make your own connection

5

to -- to the switches.

6

Now -- now, moreover, you're -- you're

7

making them -- you'll pay them for the orange cord, but

8

only at TELRIC rates, which are not realistic.

9

-- why are they wrong and you're right, especially when

Now, why

10

you have legislation, the purpose of which was to

11

encourage the independent building of new facilities?

12

mean, it's clear that the Act wanted these new entrants

13

where -- where possible to build new facilities, and not

14

simply to glom on to the extant facilities of the

15

incumbents.

16

MR. BURSCH:

Three responses to that

17

argument, Your Honor.

18

existing facilities, not about facilities to be built,

19

although there's a lot of talk about that.

20

head-on challenge to the statute or the regulations.

21

The procedural posture is that this was AT&T trying to

22

get out of arbitration agreements that it had for

23

existing entrance facilities.

24

posture of our case.

25

I

First, this case is about

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This isn't a

And so, that's the

Well, but the logic of your

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case, as you described it, would also require AT&T to

2

build out the orange cord.

3

MR. BURSCH:

Right.

And -- and two

4

additional points, Your Honor, on that.

First, they say

5

this is a large obligation because we're talking about

6

miles and miles.

7

took with the FCC when they were commenting on the TRRO.

8

At page 16a of the Michigan blue brief, in footnote 397

9

of the TRRO, the FCC acknowledges AT&T's statement that

That is not the position that AT&T

10

entrance facilities involve very short distances.

11

addition, we have the FCC's regulation and the Local

12

Competition Order, paragraph 553 --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. BURSCH:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Excuse me, excuse me.

Yes.
Extant entrance facilities

I assume they were referring to.

17
18

In

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

I believe that's correct,

yes.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. BURSCH:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

Well --

They're very short distances.
Right.

But if you ask for

22

a longer distance, they would presumably have to build

23

it.

24

MR. BURSCH:

Well, not necessarily --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And charge you TELRIC

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rates.

2

MR. BURSCH:

Right, because the FCC has

3

promulgated in -- in 521, the meet-point obligation,

4

which is another way that you can have interconnection.

5

And that demonstrates two things:

6

AT&T as the incumbent is required to build out

7

facilities, that it's not just a passive obligation.

8
9

First, that sometimes

But, in addition, when they're talking about
meet point, they say that it's up to State commissions

10

to decide the appropriate and reasonable distance.

11

So, even if we were presented with the

12

case -- not this case, but a different case -- where

13

you're talking about what's the appropriate length of

14

the facilities, the FCC has already acknowledged there

15

could be some reasonable limits on that.

16

And the most important fundamental point,

17

the fourth point on this, is that Congress already in

18

(c)(2) said you're going to have interconnection without

19

regard to market impairment, and so we're not going to

20

look at the availability of other entrance facilities in

21

the market.

22

and this method and it's technically feasible, they do

23

get the TELRIC rates.

24
25

If a competitor asks to have this location

And the competitive carriers would take
issue with the presumption that TELRIC rates are -- are
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unfair.

2

they're going to recover not only their cost but a

3

reasonable profit.

4

congressional wisdom of requiring rates like that, but

5

in the Verizon case, this Court definitively put to bed

6

the question of the reasonableness of the TELRIC rates.

7

You know, the regulations do contemplate that

And we can disagree about the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where would I read this?

8

As I read the statute, the statute says the cheap system

9

here is where they provide -- they have a duty to

10

provide the incumbent interconnection, okay?

11

requires some physical stuff.

12

MR. BURSCH:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That

Yes.
Okay.

And they have to --

14

they -- you have to -- you're not charged a lot for

15

that; there's a limit on what they can charge you for

16

the interconnection.

17

MR. BURSCH:

Correct.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, somebody is going to

19

have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being

20

tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they

21

have to pay for a wire across country to get the

22

interconnection or not.

23

Across the street, maybe they do.

24
25

That seems unreasonable.

My candidate would normally be the FCC or
some regulator decides that kind of thing, and it's up
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to them to say whether this is or is not what's needed

2

for interconnection.

3

I would have, without having read the statute in depth.

4

So, now what do I read to find out how this

That would be an intuitive account

5

works?

6

ridiculous, like my California example, from something

7

that makes a lot of sense, like they're next door and

8

have to make 50 feet of wire.

9

What is it that distinguishes something that is

MR. BURSCH:

Justice Breyer, if you look at

10

paragraph 553 of the Local Competition Order, which

11

appears at page 27a of the Michigan blue brief --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. BURSCH:

At least that's where it

14

begins.

15

second page of the paragraph.

16
17

Michigan blue --

If you flip over to -- to page 28a, this is the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where -- where -- 28a,

okay.

18

MR. BURSCH:

Very good.

19

About halfway down the -- that paragraph

20

there, it says:

"Regarding the distance from an

21

incumbent LEC's premises that an incumbent should be

22

required to build out facilities for meet-point

23

arrangements" -- so, again, this is in the meet-point

24

context -- "we believe that the parties and State

25

commissions are in a better position than the commission
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to determine the appropriate distance that would

2

constitute the required reasonable accommodation for

3

interconnection."

4
5

So, again --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So, it's up to the

State commission.

6

MR. BURSCH:

Exactly.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. BURSCH:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is the FCC speaking?

The FCC is speaking -All right.

And the State

10

commission says -- they say it's up to the State

11

commission.

12

And the State commission here said?
MR. BURSCH:

Well, here, the State

13

commission didn't say anything, because we're talking

14

about existing facilities.

15

new entrance facility to be built, for example, from

16

Lansing to Detroit.

17

about the existing facilities.

18

There's no one requesting a

That's not this case.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This case is

Mr. Bursch, the -- the key

19

to your case is -- is that an entrance facility is

20

interconnection, right?

21

MR. BURSCH:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Correct.

23

two -- those two terms.

24

MR. BURSCH:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You have to equate those

I do.
What do you rely upon to

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equate them?

2

they -- they use them as separate terms.

3

Because the -- as I read the regulations,

MR. BURSCH:

Regulation 51.5 defines

4

"interconnection" as the mutual -- or, I'm sorry -- as

5

the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of

6

traffic.

7

physically links a competitive network with an incumbent

8

network; thus, when that entrance facility is used for

9

the mutual exchange of traffic, it is providing

There is no dispute that an entrance facility

10

interconnection.

11

concluded.

12

And that's exactly what the FCC has

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't -- doesn't the

13

interconnection -- doesn't it have to be part of the

14

internal system of the incumbent carrier?

15

MR. BURSCH:

It has to be part of their

16

network.

17

that entrance facilities constructed by incumbents are

18

part of their network.

19

dispute that it can be part of the network.

20

But in the TRRO, the FCC made clear repeatedly

And so, there's really no

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so --

You say that this is a

21

link, and your -- the opposition says that it's a --

22

that it's transport.

23

Is that correct?

MR. BURSCH:

It is transport.

By

24

definition, interconnection has to include transport

25

because it involves the mutual exchange of traffic from
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

one to another.

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the -- but the reg

says interconnection does not include transport.

4

MR. BURSCH:

Well, we address that point at

5

length in our reply brief, because AT&T advances that

6

argument, and it's really a fundamental misconception or

7

misunderstanding of the regulation.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
front of me.

I have -- I've got it in

It says, "This term does not include

transport."

11

But you -- you say it does?
MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

Well, the entrance

12

facilities do include transport.

13

facilities --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. BURSCH:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. BURSCH:

18

51.5 --

All interconnection

No, I'm talking about --

Yes.
-- interconnection.

Right.

What 51.5 -- I assume

that's what you're looking at.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. BURSCH:

Yes.

That -- that goes to a term of

21

art or a phrase of art, "transport and termination of

22

traffic."

23

51.701, which is at page 35a of the red brief, what

24

they're really distinguishing there are the two types of

25

charges.

And as the FCC made clear in its regulation

You have 251(c)(2) interconnection charges and
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you have 251(b)(5) transport and termination of traffic

2

charges.

And those are two separate concepts.

3

The interconnection charge runs from the

4

competitive network to the incumbent network.

The

5

transport and termination of traffic charge runs from

6

the point of interconnection to the incumbent's end

7

customer, and that's very clear.

8

specifically acknowledged that point in note 16 of the

9

Pacific Bell case.

The Ninth Circuit

But common sense tells you that has

10

to be right because under AT&T's view, the way they

11

interpret 51.5, there would be no interconnection

12

obligation because there's always going to be transport,

13

a mutual exchange of traffic when interconnection is

14

involved.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that right or --

Do you read -Is there a mutual

18

exchange of traffic when you're talking about

19

backhauling?

20

MR. BURSCH:

No, there is not, and we don't

21

take that position.

The mutual exchange is when a

22

competitive customer talks to an incumbent customer or

23

vice versa.

24

and that's not what's at issue when we're talking about

25

251(c)(2).

Everything else we can call backhauling,

you said, well, this is an existing facility.

6

Yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But my intuition would be

8

that makes no difference whatsoever.

You could have

9

some kind of mechanism that connects two companies.

10

Now, half of it is a simple wire and half of it is bells

11

and whistles.

12

the part that's necessary for the interconnection and

13

which part is some kind of -- well, I don't know, extra

14

bells and whistles, and therefore, since it's not an

15

impairment kind of problem, they have to pay full price

16

for it.

17

And so, we have to decide which part is

That, again, seems like the kind of job that

18

Congress would leave up to a commission, but I guess I

19

want you to tell me:

20

thing, and how do we decide it?

know, again, with respect to distance, in the meet-point

context, the FCC has already delegated in LCO paragraph

553 appropriate and reasonable distances.

19

With respect to the bells and whistles, it's

20

really not that complicated.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are a lot of statements by the FCC at

16

issue in this case, but I'd like to focus on two

presented here.

20

determination in 47 CFR 51.305(e), which appears at page

21

5a of Michigan's brief, that it is the competitor, not

22

the incumbent, that gets to select the point at which

the burden of proving that interconnection at that point

key premise of the decision below, which was that as

long as the incumbent provides interconnection at some

technically feasible point that it has selected, then

it's discharged its obligation, and if the competitor

And that undercuts a

They can build

That's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, underlying that

12

question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and

13

Scalia were asking.

14

from economically ridiculous or economically burdensome.

15

How does that, "economically burdensome" -- does it get

16

considered by anyone so that -- because one could

17

imagine, as Justice Breyer said, that a competitor could

18

come in and say, now, build me the Taj Mahal as an

19

entrance facility or as an interconnection facility.

20

So, is there anyone controlling for that latter issue?

21

Technically feasible is different

MR. MILLER:

In terms of the definition of

22

"technical feasibility" -- that's a defined term in

23

section 51.5 of the regulations, and it does not include

24

economic considerations.

25

Nonetheless, as the commission explained
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

when it adopted those regulations in 1996 at paragraph

2

209 of the Local Competition Order, competitors have an

3

incentive to ask for an economically efficient means of

4

interconnection because they have to pay for it.

5

mean, the -- they don't pay as much as AT&T would

6

like -- because they're paying TELRIC rates -- but they

7

do still have to pay for interconnection, so they have

8

incentive to ask for a reasonable method of it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Miller, you

18

began by saying there were two regulations that disposed

19

of the case.

20

You got one.
MR. MILLER:

What's the second?

The -- the second is the

21

commission's determination in the Triennial Review

22

Remand Order in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand of

23

its previous order, that entrance facilities are,

24

indeed, part of the incumbent's network because the

25

statutory obligation, of course, is to allow
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interconnection at any technically feasible point within

2

the incumbent carrier's network.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. MILLER:

Where do I find that?

That's in paragraph 137 of the

5

Triennial Review Remand Order, which appears at page 10a

6

of Michigan's brief.

7

the commission traced the history of its definition of

8

the dedicated transport network elements in the Local

9

Competition Order, its revision of that in the Triennial

And in the preceding paragraph,

What section are you

Well, I've -- I've just gone

16

back to the previous two pages, but it -- 10a is

17

paragraph 137, where the court says, "In response" --

18

excuse me -- where the commission says, "In response to

the court's remand" -- that's the D.C. Circuit's remand

in the USTA case -- "we reinstate the Local Competition

element that included entrance facilities.

that definition --

And that was a definition of a network

Alderson Reporting Company

So, what the

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you do not need to

2

provide unbundled access under (c)(3) to entrance

3

facilities, right?

4

MR. MILLER:

That -- that's correct, and the

5

court of appeals, I think, perceived a contradiction

6

between saying that this isn't something to which you

7

have to provide unbundled access under (c)(3), but it is

8

something that has to be made available for

9

interconnection under (c)(2).

10

And there is no contradiction there because

11

these are separate, independent statutory obligations,

12

and what's particularly significant about the difference

13

between the two statutes -- statutes is that (c)(3) has

14

an impairment test.

15

those network elements without which the competitor

16

would be impaired in its provision of service.

17

You only have to make available

(C)(2) does not have an impairment test, and

18

that's because Congress recognized that interconnection

19

is absolutely fundamental to any effective telephone

20

competition.

reason to give less weight to briefs in this Court,

issue of whether, when backhauling is included, it's

that distinction below about, you know, oh, it is part

15

MR. MILLER:

I think our briefs in -- in the

16

two cases are consistent.

17

detail in explaining the commission's orders, but in

18

both cases, we have taken the view, as the commission

19

has consistently taken the view since the TRRO, that

20

entrance facilities don't have to be made available as

21

unbundled elements for purposes of back haul, but they

22

do have to be made available when the incumbent seeks to

23

use them for interconnection.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT H. ANGSTREICH

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7
8

MR. ANGSTREICH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

In this case, the agency is trying to use an

10

amicus brief to interpret a few sentences in orders from

11

years ago to create a new legal rule without ever going

12

through a process that would result in judicial review.

13

In fact, in the Triennial Review Orders, where the

14

agency supposedly announced this new obligation, it

15

assured incumbents like AT&T that it was not altering

16

its interpretation of the statutory interconnection

17

duty.

18

before those orders, the Government had never

19

interpreted the statutory interconnection duty to

20

require companies like AT&T to sell a fiberoptic cable

21

at TELRIC rates.

22

And the Government correctly concedes here that

Yes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I know you're

23

saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the --

24

what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say.

Well, Your Honor, I

7

actually read their brief differently, and I note that

8

in the Sixth Circuit, they didn't rely on any

9

regulations at all.

10

The argument was entirely based on

paragraph 140.

11

But going to the regulations, at the same

12

time they promulgated those rules, the government did

13

define interconnection to exclude transport, and when

14

they defended that exclusion --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, how do you address

16

their point that there are two different charges at

17

issue?

18

MR. ANGSTREICH:

There are --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That one -- that

20

interconnection by definition includes transport.

21

hard for me to think of how it doesn't because they've

22

got to travel from one place to another, so --

23

MR. ANGSTREICH:

It's

Your Honor, when the FCC

24

explained this to the Eighth Circuit, what it said is

25

there are really three things going on.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

One is (c)(2),

Official

1

is the duty to interconnect at a point, not to provide a

2

whole host of facilities that get you to the point, but

3

literally the duty to interconnect at a specific point

4

in the world; selected by the competitor to be sure, but

5

that only tells you where interconnection occurs.

6

That's the point.

7

The commission then said:

Okay, then there

8

are other obligations in the statute.

9

section 251(b)(5), and that's what obligates the

One of them is in

10

incumbent to accept telephone calls that are sent to

11

that point and to send telephone calls through that

12

point to the competitor.

13

And then, there's the third thing, and this

14

is directly from the government's brief to the Eighth

15

Circuit, where they explain that section (c)(2) --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Sixth Circuit?

17

MR. ANGSTREICH:

The Eighth Circuit.

We

18

cite this at -- from 1996, this is the contemporaneous

19

view of the agency at the time it promulgated the

20

interconnection regulations.

21

regulations against a challenge that they are too

22

narrow.

23

which then deferred to this interpretation, is if

24

section (c)(2), interconnection, included routing and

25

transmission, (c)(2) would overlap with other sections

It's defending those

And what the agency says to the Eighth Circuit,

31
Alderson Reporting Company

that, one, describe a duty to route and transmit

2

traffic, telephone calls; and, two, a duty to lease

3

facilities that will be used for routing and

4

transmission.

5

(c)(3).

6

facilities, the fiberoptic cables that competitors are

7

going to use to get to the interconnection point of

8

their choice, that duty has to arise, the commission is

9

saying here, only under section 251(c)(3).

Wireless carriers, other competitors, everyone in the

State of Ohio has since 2005 not been paying TELRIC

detriment to competition.

18

These aren't things that competitors can't

Interconnection is occurring.

And so, what the Government is trying to do

interconnection duty in a way that never gave AT&T and

other incumbents any opportunity to challenge it.

Back in the Local Competition Order, Justice

3

Sotomayor, when they adopted the TELRIC methodology,

4

they recognized -- this is in paragraph 702 --

5

interconnection services -- that's what they called it

6

back then -- are bottlenecks, not things that

7

competitors can build themselves or buy from third

8

parties in the marketplace, as the agency has found is

9

the case since 2005.

10

They never --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, now you're reading

11

limitation into the statute.

12

you're obligated to provide interconnection services.

13

It doesn't say how or limit it only to things that are

14

not bottlenecks or things that are bottlenecks.

15

says you're obligated to do X.

16

agency's saying.

17

MR. ANGSTREICH:

All the statute says is

It just

And that's what the

I understand this, Your

18

Honor.

But if the agency had ever done that through

19

notice and comment with a rule and published it in the

20

Federal Register -- which they concede that before 2003

21

they hadn't done that as to entrance facilities -- and

22

they claim they had no occasion to address the

23

question -- and then in 2003 we get a single sentence in

24

a paragraph of an order where there was no notice they

25

were considering interconnection duties, no publication
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

of a new regulation, no publication -- nothing that

2

would have, you know, told AT&T and other incumbents you

3

should seek judicial review of this if you think it's

4

wrong.

5

And now we're being told 8 years later that

6

when they said "facilities" in that paragraph, they

7

meant entrance facilities.

8

later when they said "interconnection facilities," that

9

they meant entrance facilities, even though when they

And we're being told 2 years

10

were asked that question by the Sixth Circuit they said

12

to say they've just said a little bit more now, but

13

they've said something radically different.

14

And Mr. Miller might want

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- in that regard, in

15

all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is

16

no other incumbent that has provided interconnection

17

services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC

18

rates?

19

MR. ANGSTREICH:

Prior to 2003 and 2005,

20

when there was an unbundling rule in place -- and the

21

commission had always recognized when it established

22

that unbundling rule in 1996 that competitors would use

23

unbundled transport facilities to connect to incumbent

24

switches, so to connect to those interconnection points.

25

And, sure, prior to 2005 when the unbundling rule was in
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

place, competitors would lease these facilities and pay

2

TELRIC rates and use them to get to the interconnection

3

point, but there was never during that time any

4

statement that even if there was no impairment, section

5

251(c)(2) would require the exact same thing to get to

6

the interconnection point.

7
8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What happened to the

unbundling rule?

9

MR. ANGSTREICH:

It got -- it was gotten rid

10

of.

It doesn't exist anymore.

11

those things you used to buy under the unbundling rules,

12

we don't have to sell them to you at TELRIC rates

13

anymore.

14

We'll sell them to you at just and reasonable rates

15

under the tariff.

16

competitors and wireless carriers are doing.

17

buy them from the third parties that build them and

18

advertise their offering of them.

19

We have a tariff.

So, now AT&T has said

We've always had a tariff.

You can build them yourself, as
You can

But what you can't do is say all of a sudden

20

that the interconnection duty had always required the

21

exact same thing as the unbundling duty, at least not

22

without going through a rulemaking where you lay out

23

your policy grounds.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why was the unbundling rule

abandoned?
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. ANGSTREICH:

It was abandoned because

2

the record evidence showed unambiguously that

3

competitors don't need these things from incumbents.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a bottleneck?

5

MR. ANGSTREICH:

It's not in any way, shape,

6

or form a bottleneck.

And I guess that gets to the

7

second point I'd make, which is that, again -- and I

8

don't think they rely on the regulations, Justice

9

Sotomayor, and they've never -- and the Government

10

concedes in footnote 6 that the regulations themselves

11

don't get them to where they want to go.

12

these statements they made in 2003 and 2005.

13

if you credit their new position that when they said

14

facilities and interconnection facilities, that was just

15

an imprecise way of saying entrance facilities, those

16

statements don't get you to the rule that they're

17

endorsing.

18

They need
And even

What the agency actually said is that

19

competitors will have access to these facilities -- and

20

let's pretend that means entrance facilities for the

21

time being -- will have access to entrance facilities at

22

cost-based rates to the extent that they require them to

23

interconnect, and that's paragraph 140 of the Triennial

24

Review Order and -- remand order, and they said the same

25

thing, although they used the word "need," not
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"require."

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is (c)(3).

3

MR. ANGSTREICH:

Well, I think the point is

4

what they -- this is why we think the right reading of

5

those statements is that the facilities they're

6

referring to are things they actually do require and

7

need, which are the things inside AT&T buildings that

8

they can't replicate, that it's strange for them to have

9

said you're going to get these facilities you require,

10

but to have meant something that they don't in fact

11

require.

12

But even if you want to read, again,

13

facilities and interconnection facilities to mean

14

entrance facilities, the rule that they're endorsing --

15

and, you know, Michigan now wants, if it's in the ground

16

we have to provide it; if we'd have to build it, we

17

don't have to provide it.

18

heard of that in the scope of this litigation.

19

Up until 2005, companies like Talk

It's very strange that no -- I mean -- and I think from

nonetheless, that's what happened, and the new rules get

rid of this element.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BURSCH:

Your Honors, everything you

2

heard in the last 30 minutes is premised on the idea

3

that the FCC is doing something new and that there was

4

never a promulgated regulation.

5

false.

6

That is demonstrably

If you turn with me to page 32a of the red

7

brief, this is the FCC's regulation, promulgated all the

8

way back in 1996, which defined the scope of the (c)(2)

9

interconnection obligation.

It's 47 CFR 51.321.

And

10

this goes directly to the points that Justice Sotomayor

11

was making.

12

On page 32a, the FCC says that an incumbent

13

must provide interconnection at a particular point upon

14

a request by a telecommunications carrier, such as a

15

competitor.

16

in sub (b) -- "include, but are not limited to" -- and

17

they give two examples:

18

But this isn't the be-all-end-all of interconnection

19

obligations.

20

"Technically feasible methods" -- this is

collocation and meet points.

These are exemplary.
To take an analogy, assume you had a high

21

school cafeteria, and the school board said you have to

22

provide vegetables to students when they ask for them,

23

and you have to give them the vegetable that they ask

24

for; those include broccoli and green beans.

25

don't say anything else.

And they

Then you have a separate
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obligation in (c)(3), and the school board says until we

2

see that the kids have enough nutrition, you must give

3

them peas.

4

(c)(3).

5

That's entrance facilities unbundled under

So, some time goes by, and the school board

6

says, okay, the kids are getting enough peas; we're

7

going to wipe away that second restriction, but the

8

initial restriction, the obligation in 321, is still

9

there; and if a student asks for peas, it's within the

10

scope of 321 because broccolis and green beans were

11

representative examples, and peas are another one.

12

that's where entrance facilities fit.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Why did they fight the

14

Eighth Circuit litigation?

15

you're telling me it made no difference whether (c)(3)

16

allowed them to do what they wanted to do and what the

17

Eighth Circuit said they couldn't do, right?

18

MR. BURSCH:

Why did -- I mean, it --

The premise -- no, that's

19

incorrect, Your Honor, because if you have an entrance

20

facility under (c)(3), you can use it for more things

21

than you can under (c)(2) because under (c)(3) you can

22

have it for backhauling and still get TELRIC rates.

23

Under (c)(2), you're limited to interconnection.

24

it's a different question.

25

So,

But the idea that somehow the FCC can -57

7

Very slightly different.

Backhauling is a big deal to

And to prove that point, if you

Incidentally, where do

15

either.

16

So, this isn't anything new,

So, the fact that this is not something new

17

is demonstrated conclusively by comments in the TRRO

18

proceedings from Bell South, which is now an AT&T

19

subsidiary.

20

comments, fully recognizing the obligation that went all

21

the way back to 1996 in reg 321:

22

facilities may be required for interconnection purposes

23

and Congress explicitly enacted provisions that govern

24

carrier obligations to provide interconnection in

25

251(c)(2), it was altogether reasonable for the

And Bell South says, at page 59 of its

Because entrance

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

commission to exclude these network elements from a

2

definition of ILEC dedicated transport intended for

3

unbundled access under 251(c)(3).

4

So, even incumbent carriers knew what the

5

FCC was doing in paragraph 140 of the TRRO, and there

6

was nothing new there.

7

One other small point with respect to the

8

Network Engineers' map.

This entrance facility right

9

here on page 19 already exists.

We're talking about

10

existing facilities.

11

Circuit said, that if the point of interconnection is

12

here at the ILEC switch, then that's where

13

interconnection takes place, and this entrance facility

14

is -- is truly providing transport, not interconnection.

15

And it's true, as the Sixth

But when a competitive carrier chooses its

16

own switch as the point of interconnection, this is the

17

end of the AT&T entrance facility, then interconnection

18

takes place there.

19

view, that entrance facility is interconnection under

20

(c)(2).

21

that is immutable because it is so important,

22

fundamental to competition.

And even in the Sixth Circuit's

And as Congress has said, that's the obligation
