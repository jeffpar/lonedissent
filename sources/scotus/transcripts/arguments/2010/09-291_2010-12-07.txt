ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

MR. SCHNAPPER:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Section 704(a), Title VII, prohibits the use

11
12

of third-party reprisals as a method of retaliating

13

against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise

14

opposed discrimination.

16

forbidden.

17

that.

18

The text of section 704(a)

The elements of the statute are unrelated to

The first requirement is that the plaintiff

19

show that discrimination occurred with regard to the

20

individual who engaged in a protected activity.

shown by evidence that they singled out Ms. Regalado and

Secondly, the plaintiff must show that the

2

conduct was discrimination against the person who

3

engaged in protected activity.

4

applicable to a situation where you single out, say, a

5

family member or a fiancé.

6

complaint can fairly be read to allege, was to punish

7

the person who had engaged in protected activity.

That language is easily

The purpose of that, the

21

it's a very valuable employee.

22

on the ground that the shareholders are now injured

23

because the company is worth less, having lost this

24

employee, under Title VII?

25

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Can the shareholders sue

That is the other question.

there's injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III

far.

17

Government has -- I -- I think as far as you need to go,

18

which is not the same as saying that's as far as the law

19

goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as

20

in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the

21

very method by which the law was violated, that that

22

would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved.

23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where does that come from?

Where does that test come from?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, I don't -- I

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

think that's as far as you need to go in this case.

2

think the standard of aggrieved is broader than that,

3

but the -- in -- as this has played out in the lower

4

courts since Trafficante, there's a wide range of

5

different kinds of circumstances under which the

6

Trafficante rule has been invoked in Title VII cases.

7

We're not asking you to address all of those.
JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9

I

I understand the argument.

I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me,

10

to say as far as we need to go in order to reverse.

11

That's really not how a statute ought to be interpreted,

12

I would say.

13

understand the argument that "aggrieved" means all the

14

way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is

15

necessary to satisfy the Constitution.

16

that argument.

17

implications.

What -- now, I

And I understand

It's a very broad argument with a lot of

But if -- if that's not correct, then what

18
19

What does it mean?

is the correct test and where does it come from?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

20

Well, Your Honor, I think

21

that there are two other limitations that would be

22

applicable here, as indeed they would have been under

23

Title VIII.

24
25

First one is proximate cause, which will cut
off a lot of injuries down the road.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

And Title VII is

Official

1

adopted against a background of proximate cause rules,

2

and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in

3

using the word "person aggrieved" they meant -- Congress

4

meant to set those aside.
Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of

5
6

the word "aggrieved" is that it is -- "aggrieved" is

7

both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower

8

than "injured."

9

not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people

It is broader -- and that's, of course,

10

who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the

11

future.
But it also has a second element which is

12
13

that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong.

14

If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm

15

probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football

16

in the middle of a football game.

17

thing to do.

18

That's a legitimate

So I think that there has to be a wrong, and

19

the wrong has to be the -- the basis of the -- of the

20

plaintiff's objection.

21

the plaintiff really didn't care one way or another why

22

-- why that harm had happened.

23

case, that's precisely why Thompson complains.

24

suggesting that he would be wronged if he were ever

25

fired at all.

You could have a situation where

What -- what do you do

4

with the argument that says there's a middle step?

5

can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and

6

then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense

7

that he was hurt, he was injured.

If I might go back to how that came up in

the court of appeals, the court of appeals appears to

16

18

aggrieved.

And then, in footnote 1, the

Notwithstanding that, they then went on to

The -- the statute provides an express cause

23

of action.

14

plaintiff would have to prove that that was indeed the

15

company's motive for picking him to fire him.
Secondly, under this Court's decision in

16
17

Burlington Northern, the plaintiff would have to show

18

that this was a retaliatory action sufficiently serious

19

that it was -- it would likely persuade a reasonable

20

employee in Regalado's position -- dissuade her

21

complaint.

Respondent's contention that -- that they're entitled to

and it has -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

2

How does that translate?

3

How does that Burlington Northern standard translate

4

into the situation in which there is some sort of

5

relationship between the -- the person who engaged in

6

the protected conduct and the person who suffers the

7

adverse employment action?
That's what's troubling to me about -- about

8
9

the theory.

Where it's a fiancé, it's -- that's a

10

relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole

11

spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser

12

relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -­

13

unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory

14

is rather troubling.

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I think -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can you help -- can you help

17

provide where the clear line is?

Does it go to -- does

18

it include simply a good friend?

Does it include

19

somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day

20

with the person who engaged in the protected conduct?

22

protected conduct?

Are these all questions that have to

They wouldn't all have to go

to him, and the remedy is cure the way in which I was

discriminated against.

17

that we're discriminating against her.

Why couldn't she bring this suit?

And to cure that way, you would

Do you give him back pay?

18

And she says:

Do you restore

19

him?

You do everything you would normally have to do,

20

because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury,

21

though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for

22

opposing a practice.

What's wrong with that theory?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think that that kind of

24

remedy would pose very serious problems under Article

25

it -- the -- ordinarily, Article III would bar me from

suing for an award of money to be paid to somebody else.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's because the

award of money to be paid for somebody else, their

things in this case.

action.

position that she could not have sued for retaliation?

15

It's -- it's directed at employers who might refuse to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

language fairly describes the ordinary English meaning

The reason the relationship is important in

this case is because it tends to render plausible the

argument that there's a causal connection between the

adverse action visited on Thompson in this case -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

I understand that.

I do

understand that, but I wish you'd -- I'd like you to

Does the employer have to keep a -- a

20

journal on the intimate or casual relationships between

21

all of its employees so that it knows what it's -- it's

22

opening itself up to when it wants to take an action

23

against somebody?

24
25

MS. KRUGER:
the contrary.

No, I think it's actually quite

I think if the employer doesn't know
19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

about the relationship, any allegation like the

2

allegation that we have in this case simply isn't going

3

to be plausible.

4

contention that there is a relationship between one

5

employee's protected activity and an adverse action

6

visited on the plaintiff.

It isn't going to be a plausible

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Well, but you say -­

8

but it won't be because of the degree of connection

9

between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the

10

means of retaliating.
I understood your brief.

11

I'm just looking

12

at page 6.

The limitation you propose is someone -­

13

someone close to him.

14

"prohibits an employer from firing an employee because

15

someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint."

The anti-retaliation prohibition

19

MS. KRUGER:

20

How are we

Well, if there's -- I don't

21

think that there's any reason for the Court to try to

22

fashion a hard-and-fast rule that identifies some

23

relationships that are close enough and others that

24

aren't.

25

The question in every case is the question

particular person.

You -- your -- your concern is confined to a

In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited

10
11

universe that you don't have any reason to know where it

12

ends.

13

MS. KRUGER:

Well, it's certainly going to

14

be important, whenever a plaintiff brings a suit like

15

this, both to establish that the employer knew of the

16

relationship and the relationship was one that is of

17

sufficient closeness that a reasonable employee might be

18

deterred from making or supporting a charge of

19

discrimination -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why does that matter

21

under your theory?

Let's assume the different -­

22

slightly different, that they're just coworkers, but a

23

coworker who has expressed sympathy for the

24

discriminated person, has spoken about them in a

25

favorable light or has tried to defend them.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Would that

person be protected from being fired -­

MS. KRUGER:

Well -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if the intent was to

4

retaliate against the person complaining of

5

discrimination by getting rid of their friend who's

6

supporting them?

7

MS. KRUGER:

In that scenario, I think that

8

that person would have a cause of action but for a

9

different reason.

10

Under this Court's decision in Crawford,

11

that person would probably be considered to be a person

12

who had opposed the discrimination and, for that reason,

13

would themselves have engaged in a protected activity.

14
15
16

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So an opposer is anyone

MS. KRUGER:

That's our understanding of

what this Court held in -- in the Crawford case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But let's assume they

19

did it just in private, but the employer knew it.

They

20

overheard a conversation between the close friend and

21

the employee saying:

22

know you've been treated unfairly.

I really am in support of you; I
I like you; I like

2

would find the reasonable employee in the position of

5

discrimination if they knew the consequence was that

before a jury as an employer all the time.

I want -- I

I don't even want to mess with

10

people that might -- that might be buying a lawsuit.

11

And you're telling me, well, you know, I can't help you.

12

You have to go before a jury and say if this person is

13

close enough.
Why can't we say members of family and

14
15

fiancés?

MS. KRUGER:

16
17

Would -- would that be a nice rule?
Well, I think that it would be

an essentially arbitrary rule.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. KRUGER:

I know.

At end of the day, when the

20

question is just the question that the Court assigned

21

under Burlington Northern, it's a question that turns on

22

the specific facts and context of the -- a specific

23

case.

harm on an employee for retaliatory reasons.

What would you say is the degree of

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think that there's any

way to fashion a hard-and-fast rule.

19

matter is that most of the cases that have arisen that

20

have raised third-party retaliation arguments and which

21

are indeed cognizable under a number of -- of employment

22

statutes -- and I don't think Respondent disputes that

they are rightly so -- have largely concerned

relationships like the relationship between parent and

between very good friends in the workplace, whereas

there is a D.C. Court of Appeals decision that holds

that a merely professional relationship that doesn't

exhibit that degree of personal affection isn't

7

sufficiently close.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MS. KRUGER:

Very good friends is enough?

I think that a reasonable

10

employee who knows that the consequence of making or

11

supporting a charge of discrimination is going to be

12

that their best friend at work is going to be fired may

13

be deterred from engaging in protected activity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14
15

And in -- in your view,

could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?
MS. KRUGER:

16

Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do

17

think that Regalado could have brought a suit in her own

18

right, because she, too, is a person aggrieved within

19

the meaning of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

Well, if that is so, why

doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?
MS. KRUGER:

22

Well, for two reasons, Justice

23

Kennedy.

First of all, Regalado here didn't sue, just

24

like most people in her position didn't sue, because

5

that part of the thrust of your argument is that this

6

was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was

7

hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well,

8

it's not important enough for her to sue, so somebody

situation, she certainly -- she might sue, but she also

It's someone close to them.

the other person might not sue.

time that they need to decide whether or not to press

charges.

5

But that's different from

6

the -- the point that you were first making, I thought,

7

was these are lay people; they don't have a lawyer; they

would naturally think that the person who was hurt would

be the one to sue.

problem?

retaliated against, would sue.

They're lay people.

point.

Regalado in the driver's seat entirely with respect to

You abandon that -- that

MS. LATHEROW:

8

the right to bring a cause of action, it is going to be

9

very difficult.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. LATHEROW:

Okay.
But I think that the way that

12

Burlington reads now, and that is whether someone would

13

be dissuaded, if that is harm to her, then she could

14

bring the cause of action.

15

applying the Burlington standard is you could have

16

someone who is dissuaded from filing a claim but may not

17

be harmed.

18

What's difficult about

For example, if an employer announced a

19

proposition that it was going to fire an employee at

20

random whenever someone filed an EEOC charge, I might

21

not file a charge because I wouldn't want someone, even

Eric Thompson is an employee as well, but he doesn't
