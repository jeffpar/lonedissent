CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The proposition that Petitioners are here

13

challenging is the one adopted or embraced by the

14

Federal Circuit that says that the United States

15

Government can declare that certain of its government

16

contracting partners have operated in default and, under

17

those circumstances, can reach into the government

18

contractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion

19

of moneys that were spent by the United States, but for

20

services that were rendered, without question, pursuant

21

to the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the

22

United States Government, and that when the contractor

23

seeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in

24

some kind of default conduct, that the government can

25

assert the state-secrets privilege and, in so doing,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

deprive the contractor of the ability effectively to

2

respond to the government's conclusion.

3

Under those circumstances, it seems to me

4

that the statement in this Court's decision in United

5

States v. Reynolds, which is that the government is

6

certainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege,

7

but when it does so, it has to assume certain

8

responsibilities that come from it, at least in the

9

circumstances where the United States is the moving

10
11

party.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, when the

12

contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first

13

aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their

14

reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract

15

price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.

16

At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but

17

I think at that time the contractors said nothing at all

18

about superior knowledge and the government's obligation

19

to share information that it hadn't shared.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

There was nothing specific

21

with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg.

22

the contractors identified the superior knowledge

23

problem arose, obviously, when the government took the

24

extraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up

25

until that point, obviously, the parties are attempting
Alderson Reporting Company

The first time

to negotiate and work to a final resolution of this

2

project, as you would hope any contracting entities

3

would, to bring the contract to a happy resolution,

4

so -­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you would expect them

6

to say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going

7

forward on this contract, to at least mention it.

8

to -­

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

And

Well, yes, I think you have

10

to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during

11

this period of time, obviously, there were consistent

12

efforts and requests being made to get access to both

13

the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there

14

were discussions that went back and forth, and the

15

district court -- or the Court of Federal Claims

16

specifically held -- eventually, the information was

17

forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too

18

late in order to effectively allow the contract to

19

proceed as -- as planned.

20

So I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in

21

a perfect world, maybe you would have identified this.

22

But in this situation, the parties are simply trying to

23

come to some kind of a resolution that allows both sides

24

to be satisfied by the final -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

to share that technology a part of this contract or a

condition to the contract?

hypothetical.

15

sharing of state secrets, and the government then

16

invokes its privilege.

17

this one in terms of due process?

18

wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a

19

condition of the contract, require a different treatment

20

than this situation where the government's just saying,

21

if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the

22

contract, then you do what every other litigant with a

23

privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked

24

against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.

25

Let's assume the contract required the

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's usually what

Right.

And we would have

been perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we

5

had.

Claims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a

7

position to resolve it.

But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal

8

But I want to answer your more fundamental

9

question, Your Honor, as to the -- you know, the basic

10

point is, is that the background principle of law, the

11

superior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the

12

parties when they enter into an agreement.

13

would have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis

14

case and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has

15

acknowledged the superior knowledge defense.

16

been around for a long time.

17

understood basis on which the parties enter into an

18

agreement.

19

I mean, that

That's

It's a-- it's an

That's the first answer.
The second answer is that you're asking us

20

to put into a contract something about information that

21

we don't know anything about.

22

some sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't

23

know anything about the other programs that are

24

identified here.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We -- I mean, we have

Wait a minute.

Alderson Reporting Company

Where's

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

the obligation of the government to tell you build it

2

this way using the technology we already have?

3

thought your claim was that you were promised this

4

information, and you structured the contract based on

5

that promise.

6
7
8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I

Well, our claim -- we have

separate -- we have a series of distinct claims.
Our first claim is that we never would have
entered into the contract in the first place if the

10

government had provided us with information based on its

11

superior knowledge that the -- for instance, the weight

12

specifics that we were being asked to provide or to

13

supply were literally impossible to comply with based on

14

what the government already knew.

15

told that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in

16

the situation where we are here -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we had been just

There's a factual

18

dispute about that.

19

is a claim that they told you your weight estimates

20

weren't right.

21

I think somewhere I read that there

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well -- I mean, that may be a

22

factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I'd be happy to

23

litigate that issue if -- if we can get to that point

24

where we're in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of

25

our particular defense.

But the bottom line here is --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

and again to state the proposition as starkly as it -­

2

as it is, because this is the way it comes to the Court

3

from the Federal Circuit:

4

government can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars

5

against us and tell us that we cannot defend against

6

that claim even though the reason why we were unable to

7

comply with the contract is because of the fact that the

8

government didn't provide us information either at the

9

outset or as we went along.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

They're saying that the

The two questions I'd have

11

is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I did not

12

-- I did have her question, because what that suggests

13

is, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in

14

this case.

15

opinions here, and you think this is a defense coming

16

out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance

17

to it.

18

it.

And you just read the two circuit court

That was her question, I think, as I understood

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I answer -­
In other words, it's not

21

unfair.

But let me give you the other question because,

22

sometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that.

23

And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was

24

said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply

25

it to government contracting, where sophisticated
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their

2

own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench

3

into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing

4

the whole monkey.

That's my second question.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

One, that this isn't a case

7

that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government

8

contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is

9

overwhelming.

10
11

Now, I'd like your views on both of

those.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, it seems to me

12

clearly that this is the precise situation where

13

Reynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a

14

legitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we

15

don't know precisely what information we didn't have and

16

were never entitled to.

17

how strong is our defense under these circumstances.

So it's very difficult to say

18

What we do know is that the Court of Federal

19

Claims judge looked very carefully at this and said that

20

we had made an impressive showing without regard to any

21

of the confidential or privileged information of a prima

22

facie defense in these circumstances.

23

is we had a very valid defense.

24

We're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to

25

force the government to assert its state secrets.

So our position

This is not pretextual.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

a fairly contrived approach to litigation and, frankly,

2

not something that I could imagine any circumstance in

3

which we would do that.

4

Two, I don't see how this throws a monkey

5

wrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws

6

out the monkey, because -- because the basic

7

understanding here is that the government is not

8

entitled to force its contractor down along this course.

9

If the government has information available to it, then

10

it has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming

11

with the information with the contractor, either at the

12

outset, which would have been the best of all

13

circumstances here, or as matters go along.

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the Petitioners as a

formal matter were the moving party; isn't that right?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, not -- I mean, "moving

17

party" I think is -- is not a self-defined concept,

18

Justice Alito.

19

The Petitioners are the plaintiffs.

JUSTICE ALITO:

They were the plaintiffs.

20

And the review scheme that you outlined was known to

21

them beforehand.

22

So why do we need to look beyond that?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, because the review

23

scheme also says that the very -- in 1986, in the

24

Assurance case, the Federal Circuit said -- which was

25

before this contract was entered into, the Federal
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

Circuit said the filing -- the mere filing of a

2

complaint immediately vacates the contracting officer's

3

rule.

4

So our understanding at the time we entered

5

into this agreement is that if there were a problem with

6

the way the contracting officer operated, we would be

7

allowed to file a claim and immediately take the

8

contracting officer's rule off the table.

9

circumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to

Under those

10

go back to the status quo ante in that situation, which

11

means there's no contracting officer decision, there's

12

no basis on which the government can make a claim for

13

1.35 billion, now $3 billion.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain that -­

15

you've referred to it several times now.

16

that was not a progress payment based on completed work.

17

The government says that that money was advanced; you

18

had not complied with what was necessary to comply with

19

to get that 1.35 million.

20

million that you legitimately received as a progress

21

payment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled

22

what you needed to do to get that.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

I thought that

They distinguished the $1.35

Well, what had not happened

24

is that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off

25

by the contracting officer approving it and thereby
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

reducing it to a liquidated claim.

2

different statement than to say -- and, indeed, we have

3

an argument that, at least with respect to half of that,

4

that it had already effectively been approved through a

5

mechanism independent of the contracting officer.

6

But that's a vastly

But the bottom line here is these were

7

services rendered, actually rendered.

This was not some

8

kind of a prepayment for services to be rendered in the

9

future.

That's not the nature of this contract.

These

10

were -- this was for work we had done, for which we had

11

submitted specific claims, and for which the contracting

12

officer had pending before him at the time.

13

know, what the government says is that -- is that it was

14

a payment and they didn't ultimately get the airplanes

15

that were the ultimate desire of the contract under

16

these circumstances, and that's obviously true because

17

they terminated the contract a year before the airplanes

18

were due to be provided to them.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so, you

But you are here seeking

20

to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from

21

this contract what you would have gotten if it had been

22

successfully completed, including any profit -­

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

No, Justice Ginsburg,

24

that's not true.

All we are asking for is -- are the

25

remedies that are fully available if you were to convert
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

this from a termination for default into a termination

2

for convenience.

3

you know, that -- the government has a wonderful

4

mechanism there.

5

lost profits damages that might otherwise be available

6

in a situation where you have a more traditional breach

7

of contract.

8
9

And under those circumstances, what -­

It protects it against the kinds of

So all we're -- all we're asking for is the
actual amount of money that we expended, that the -­

10

frankly, the Court of Federal Claims explicitly found,

11

and at this stage it's unchallenged, although presumably

12

it might be litigable at some point, but that these were

13

all reasonable, allowable, and fairly allocable costs to

14

these -- to this particular contract.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why shouldn't we view

16

this as if it were a dispute between two private

17

contracting parties?

18

party would be the moving party with respect to some of

19

the claims and the other party would be the moving party

20

with respect to the remaining claims.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

And if we did that, perhaps one

Justice Alito, I think that

22

is precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and

23

we'd be very comfortable with that, because it's quite

24

clear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way

25

that -- that you articulate because of -- because of the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

way the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the

2

government is unquestionably the moving party, the party

3

seeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.35

4

billion -­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would -- I think it's

6

questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason:

7

that it's an implied term of this contract that the

8

government has a duty to share certain information, and

9

you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the

10

contract.

11

you are the moving party.

12

enforce this implied term of the contract.

13

You say

So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty,

MR. PHILLIPS:

You're saying:

Court, please

Well, not -- I mean, you

14

could -- that's one way to articulate it.

15

other way to articulate it, which -- which is much more

16

consistent with the reality of what's going on here, is

17

that the government is making a claim for $1.35 billion

18

for which -- on the basis that we did not act in a

19

timely fashion.

20

in this litigation anymore, is just the time of the

21

actions that we took.

22

I think the

And that's the only basis that exists

And our answer to that claim is to say:

No,

23

we -- we are not at fault for the delays because you did

24

not provide us the information or you did not spare us

25

the burden of having to go down this path in the first
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

instance.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but then you go on to

3

say:

Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the

4

additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already

5

given us -­

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

But -­
-- plus this additional

money that we've expended.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But that just goes to

10

Justice Alito's question about is there some way to

11

evaluate those claims separately, and the answer is,

12

yes, they should be evaluated separately.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -­

Well, why shouldn't we?

I

14

mean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the

15

government has come up with a defense that makes it

16

impossible to decide who's in the right here -­

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
-- why don't we just -- you

19

know, I think the usual course taken by courts would be

20

to leave the parties where they are.

21

be litigated.

22

billion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the

23

additional amount.

The matter can't

Why don't we just leave you where you are,

2

both you and the government, assuming we agree with you

3

on all the rest?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, to be sure, we

5

would be much more comfortable in the world you just

6

articulated, Justice Scalia, than we are in the Federal

7

Circuit.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

With interest.

With interest.

I forgot

the interest.

15
16

Yes, you would be 1.35

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's starting to add up,

Your Honor.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

But -- and -- certainly we

19

think that's -- that is the minimum that we should be

20

entitled to, and maybe to some extent you could say

21

we're sort of being a little greedy.

22

reality is that the standard rule is that if you take a

23

contract and you say you cannot make a determination

24

that the contractor has been guilty of default, then

25

that contract should be, in the -- kind of the basic
Alderson Reporting Company

But the -- the

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

contract law and it's also in this -- in this agreement,

2

that you -- you convert it to a termination for

3

convenience.

4

And then the question simply is, what rights

5

flow from having declared this to be a termination for

6

convenience?

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mentioned the 1.3 -­

8

that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was

9

also another figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on

10

top of that.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13
14

Right.

And that -- that -­

So that certainly

wouldn't be leaving you where you were.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no.

I mean, actually,

15

what -- what the $1.2 billion was, was the additional

16

amounts of money that were actually expended by the

17

contractors that were reasonable, allocable, and

18

allowable, by and according to the Court of Federal

19

Claims, on this agreement.

20

the standard operating procedure.

21

termination for convenience, where the government says,

22

look, we've decided we just don't want to have this -­

23

these -- we don't want these airplanes anymore, so let's

24

just call it off, which the government has the right to

I mean, you're making it up.

It seems to me you call the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, and the question is, if

you call the game off, what -- what flows from that?

16

And it seems to me that it -- you can say we'll let the

17

government call it a default, I suppose, or you could

18

just as easily say -- and obviously the position we

19

would take is you say the government cannot call it a

20

default because, in order to get some kind of a

21

determination along those lines, somebody is going to

22

have to make a judgment that's not an honest assessment

23

of the -- of the -- of the facts of this case.

24
25

And so, if you say it's not a default
termination, then there's just a certain amount of -Alderson Reporting Company

certain consequences that flow from converting it, and

it automatically converts at that point to a termination

situation, then you reallocate the costs in precisely

5

the way that the Court of Federal Claims has done this

at this point.

And in a termination for convenience

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but -­
Mr. Phillips -­
-- the fallacy is we're

10

not -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not

11

saying that it's not a default termination.

12

saying we don't know.

13
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

We're

And the question

is -­

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We're saying we don't know.

16

We don't know what the state-secrets thing is.

so we don't know who's in the right here.

MR. PHILLIPS:

The

Well, I -- I -- the

problem -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why force the government

to -- to go to a termination for convenience?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, I would think

24

that the -- that the more appropriate way to proceed

25

under those circumstances, given that a default
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

termination carries with it a lot of collateral

2

consequences, it exposes you to subsequent problems in

3

the contracting context, it creates the possibility of

4

debarment in -- in future proceedings, that rather than

5

allow a finding that no one can comfortably conclude is

6

the right finding to stay in place and have those

7

collateral consequences flow from it, the more

8

appropriate way to proceed would be to say:

9

can't make a determination in this case that there

10

Look, I

should be a termination for default.

11

And under those -- and so, therefore, the -­

12

the -- under the contract, under the government

13

contracting principles generally, it automatically

14

converts over to a termination for convenience.

15

once that happens, then you go down the road of -- of

evaluating those costs.

got arguments about those costs, I'm sure, and we can -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A termination for

convenience carries its own automatic consequences that

appear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation

of the default termination has been invoked because

7

there is a risk to the United States.

reasoned way to do it -­

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

So, is there a

Now, are you -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- to not -- to not

11

impose that unfairness on the government?

12

there's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given

13

that you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to

14

say you entered a contract knowing the government could

15

invoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk

of that.

do this.

contracted around it.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure, and so could the

government.

4

principle here is United States v. Reynolds.

5

States v. Reynolds says that if somebody is the moving

6

party, that is the party seeking affirmative relief,

7

that's the party who's going to bear the burden to -­

8
9

I mean, the reality is that the background

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And United

Mr. Phillips, could I ask

you whether that principle makes any sense in this

10

contracting situation, because both parties have argued

11

it as though the question of who is the moving party is

12

determinative of this case, but in a contract situation

13

the question of who's the moving party is very often

14

arbitrary or fortuitous.

15

If you think about it in a private setting,

16

you have one contract -- one contractor who fails to

17

perform or -- or provides some deficient product,

18

another who decides it's not going to pay, and the

19

question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter

20

of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first -­

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
-- what the payment schedule

23

has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their

24

money back or simply refusing to pay it at all.

25

So, why in this contract situation is the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving

2

party -- why does -- why does that make such a

3

difference?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think that

5

actually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would

6

have envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago,

7

used the language "moving party" rather than "plaintiff"

8

or "defendant" precisely for that reason, because I

9

think what the Court had in mind is the party who was

10

seeking affirmative relief.

11

And -­

action.

It was thinking of a

It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, no.

To be sure, that -­

15

that's the specific context, although the Court's

16

language is broader than that.

17

about itself as a defendant in a tort action.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It just didn't talk

But it can't possibly be the

19

case that the question is what the payment schedule is.

20

If I've paid you already and then I find your product

21

deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my

money back.

23

pay you, then you're going to go to court and say you

24

have to pay me.

25

If I find your product deficient before I

So why should that difference make a

difference with respect to the constitutional question

before us?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, because in the one

4

situation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services

5

that were unquestionably rendered and which, in our

6

judgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the

7

obligation under this contract.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Both party has a claim here.

One says you provided deficient performance; the other

10

says you were obligated to pay me.

11

has the claim and who has the affirmative defense -- it

12

can be structured in either way.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

The question of who

I don't disagree with that,

14

Justice Kagan.

know, what -- what -- what are -- what do principles of

16

fundamental fairness tell you to do in this case?

17

I think the bottom line, though, is, you

That's exactly my problem,

because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold

anything in your favor.

says to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was

21

unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and

not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay?

such a rationale has no application in a civil forum

MR. PHILLIPS:

And the non-privileged

information that it had available to it.

that you were right as a matter of law, correct?

So it made this judgment on the basis of a

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

Thank you, Mr.

GENERAL KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

Two basic things decide this case.

First,

11

the government is not affirmatively invoking the power

12

of the Federal court; only the plaintiffs are.

13

Mr. Phillips's clients who 20 years ago walked into the

14

Federal court and asked that court to set aside the

15

decision of the contracting officer and to award them

16

over a billion dollars in damages.

17

contrast, simply asked the court to dismiss the Federal

18

lawsuit.

It was

The government, by

19

And, second, Reynolds makes clear that the

20

state-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at

21

most only when the party that is relying on secret

22

information is trying to use the Federal court to alter

23

the legal status quo.

24
25

And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have -- we've

gotten to this point in the dispute because you say
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

they're at fault; they say you're at fault.

Under the

2

state-secrets doctrine, we can't resolve that question.

3

Why don't we call the whole thing off?

4

fault; that means it's terminated not for fault, but for

5

convenience, and that's it.

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

Nobody's at

Well, for several reasons.

7

One is that is the affirmative use of the Federal courts

8

to alter the legal status quo.

9

Reynolds is that -­

10

I think the principle of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, only because

11

you altered the legal status quo -- the legal status quo

12

is they're going along with their contract, and you

13

altered it by holding them in default.

14

GENERAL KATYAL:

I disagree, Mr. Chief

15

Justice.

16

that the contracting officer will decide whether or not

17

there's a default termination, and once there is that,

18

they owe -- once the contracting officer so decides,

19

then they owe the unliquidated payments that have -­

20

I think that the contract itself specifies

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't that -- isn't

21

that the affirmative step with the contracting officer

22

saying there's a default?

23

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, it's certainly an

24

affirmative step under the terms of the contract, but it

is not an affirmative step of the Federal court.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Am I correct to interpret

14

what you've just said to mean that you think this case

15

should be decided under the basic principle of Reynolds,

16

that the party that seeks the affirmative relief -­

17

seeks affirmative relief from the court is the -- is the

18

party that bears the burden involving the invocation of

19

the state-secrets privilege?

20

adopt a new test applicable in the contracts situation?

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

You're not asking us to

Absolutely.

I don't think

22

we need to go there.

I do think that there are special

23

arguments available in this case because it is a

24

contract, as Justice Breyer said, with sophisticated

25

parties who ex ante will decide who bears the burden of

coming into court and -- and so on.

2

this is a simple principle that, in a world in which the

3

court doesn't know who is right and wrong in the

4

superior knowledge defense -- and that's the answer to

5

the question that Justice Sotomayor asked to Mr.

6

Phillips a moment ago about what did the Court of

7

Federal Claims ultimately decide.

8

there was a prima facie case.

10

But here I think

question very quickly.

I don't think Reynolds says that if the

government is the moving party, it's an automatic loss.

2

I think that's a back-up argument that we have advanced

3

in our brief that I think there is no reason whatsoever

4

for the Court to give its view -­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's talk about "moving

6

party."

I -- I don't -- I don't know that "moving

7

party" means who comes into court first.

8

would -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute,

9

I would say the moving party is the party who is trying

I would -- I

10

to use principles of law to change the contract, and

11

that's the government here.

12

government is blowing the whistle; it is the government

13

which is saying you are in default, and under the law,

14

since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we

15

can claim the money we've already paid you.

The government -- the

party in the -- in the context of a contract.
GENERAL KATYAL:

Justice Scalia, I think

20

it's important to add to your definition "using legal

21

principles in a Federal court," because that's I think

what Reynolds is talking about.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's not some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

But I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic

2

of the matter when applied to a contract situation such

3

as this ought to be the party who is blowing the

4

whistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the

5

one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this

6

result.

7

the law requires this result or not.

8

me, ought to be the moment of truth.

9

And then we say, well, we can't tell whether

GENERAL KATYAL:

That, it seems to

I -- I don't think,

10

Justice, that's what either Reynolds is getting at or

11

what this Court's subsequent decisions about a state of

12

uncertainty in the law and what the role of the Federal

13

courts is getting at.

14

these decisions say together is if you don't know one

15

way or another, you should return; you should wind the

16

clock back to the status quo ante before the lawsuit was

17

filed.

18

a right of the government to have $1.35 billion.

19

I think, rather, what all of

And at that status quo ante, there was undoubted

Now, I understand some of you have

20

suggested, well, maybe we should just cut it even and

21

they get to keep the $1.35 billion and we get to keep -­

22

and we don't have to pay the $1.2 billion.

23

there's no principled way to do that, which is what I

24

think Mr. Phillips's answer -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suggest

It wasn't the undoubted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

right of the government before the lawsuit was filed.

2

It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the

3

contracting officer was correct that there had been a

4

default.

5

right of the government.

6

If he was wrong about that, it was not the

GENERAL KATYAL:

Justice Scalia, let me read

7

to you the contract to which they agreed.

It's at Joint

8

Appendix, page 120 to '21:

9

terminated under the default clause, the contractor

"If the contract is

10

shall, on demand, repay to the government the amount of

11

unliquidated progress payments."

12

And then, what happened, as a result of that

13

demand letter that we sent right after the -- after the

14

termination for default, was they came to us, hat in

15

hand, and said:

16

right now, our banks are going to complain, and so on.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's

unconscionable.

7

extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know

why we don't have that just as a law of -- of -- the

9

Federal common law of contracts.

10

13

15

That it seems to me is just an

I don't know why we

need to elevate this to a due process analysis.

11
12

The components of the due

GENERAL KATYAL:
things.

I guess I would say two

One is, if you look -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Assuming that we're -- we

apply Reynolds, which -­
GENERAL KATYAL:

Right.

And I think if you

16

-- if you were to look to that background common law

17

contract principle, you would look not just to Reynolds

18

but to Tenet -- or excuse me, Totten, which I think

19

makes clear that, at the time they signed their

20

contract, they were on notice that highly classified

21

information that is the subject of -- of litigation is

22

something that generally can't be litigated in the

23

Federal court.

24
25

And then, if you wanted to think about due
process and the overlay of unconscionability or whatever
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

with respect to Federal contracts, you would ordinarily

2

assume that the contract itself from highly

3

sophisticated parties would work that out ahead of time.

4

And so if they were concerned about this situation

5

unfolding, they could have written into the contract

6

that they should get certain information and that if the

7

government invoked the state-secrets privilege, it would

8

automatically terminate the contract's default and

9

convert a default termination into a termination for

10

convenience.

That just restates the

question of what -- what do you do if you apply the

Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say,

17

think that's almost a wash.

18

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I don't think it

19

comes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think

20

the contract is undoubtedly clear that, in order to

21

challenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer

22

about a default termination, they have to come into

23

Federal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative

24

judicial relief from the Federal court, to change the

world.

We don't have to do that.

GENERAL KATYAL:

That is correct.

Some of

that is at Joint Appendix 137 to 140.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips said the

reason they couldn't specify this information is they

didn't know what it was.

GENERAL KATYAL:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
They -- they didn't know

what -- it was secret information.

12

wouldn't even know what to ask for.

13

GENERAL KATYAL:

They didn't know -­

I have to say, it is a very

odd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar

GENERAL KATYAL:

Two things.

One is that

impossibility claim was separately litigated before the

Court of Federal Claims, along with 18 other claims of

14

theirs in defense to the 1.35 billion and this rest that

taken place in a highly classified environment.

Are you saying it was not

impossible to do it at that weight?

one way or the other.

But our central submission to you, Justice

Scalia, is:

If you're not sure, as you were saying to

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, it's a convenient

rule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they

signed the contract.

knew the deal going in, which is if they wanted to

would have to come in.

Now, you could have structured it very

differently.

into a termination for convenience -­

You could have said we -- you know, that

question here.

their rule, they're asking the court to proceed

counterfactually and say that they are entitled to not

they had proved their superior knowledge claim.

with what they have.

only these two things; there's either default

termination or termination for convenience, and nothing

in between.

Do you agree that that's the world that
we're dealing with, those two choices and nothing else?

18

GENERAL KATYAL:

I do agree that that is -­

19

that's the way the contract is written.

20

distinguished between those two and distinguished

21

between liquidated payments -- as to which the

22

government has no right in the event of a default

termination, and we're not seeking that -- and

unliquidated payments, as to which the government has an

absolute right at the moment the contracting officer

It

decides there has been a default termination.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't care how the

contract's written.

4

we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that

5

we're not going to try to apply the contract because we

6

can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong,

7

it's totally irrelevant what the contract says.

8

just leave the parties where they are.

9

I mean, if we're going to -- if

GENERAL KATYAL:

Justice Scalia, I am saying

10

leave the parties where they are under the terms of the

11

contract.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, that -- Justice

in the business of micromanaging under the Due Process

16

Clause in a contractual situation with parties that can

17

protect themselves ex ante very easily.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, they

We can -- we can do it as

20

a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts.

And

21

when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds,

22

Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not --

23

I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really

24

definable content in our law.

25

a question of the burden of persuasion.

It seems to me it's just

Alderson Reporting Company

44

At one point, the contractor has to proceed.

2

He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the

3

government has to go back and forth.

point, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes

5

the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's

6

fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of

7

contracts.

8
9

GENERAL KATYAL:

And if at some

So even if you followed

that reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a

10

reason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still

11

lose, because they still bear the burden of proof and

12

persuasion on superior knowledge, the -- the excuse

13

that's at issue in this case.

14

Now, I don't think that would be the rule,

15

that that's an appropriate rule, Justice Kennedy,

16

because I think underlying Reynolds is this central

17

proposition that a court shouldn't be involved,

18

shouldn't be picking winning -- winners and losers

19

either way, when the state of knowledge is unknowable.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So just to make sure I

21

understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had

22

prevented you from being able to prove your default

23

claim, that you were unable to make that showing because

24

of state secrets.

GENERAL KATYAL:

Right.

Well, in that

circumstance, again, the -- I think the case would be

dismissed, because they would be coming in and seeking

affirmative judicial relief to void the contracting

officer's decision and to get whatever damages they want

state secrets prevented you from making your affirmative

case, you should win that one, too?

I think -- I think that

that would be -- the general proposition is if the

Justice Sotomayor, this is

a very important question, and I think that that's the

impression left by their briefs and it's wrong.

So the

filing of their claim -- their claim in the Court of

11

Federal Claims they say vacated the contracting

officer's decision.

13

605(b) in the -- in the Contracting Disputes Act says

14

that a clause can be put into the contract to continue

15

it in effect and require performance even if there's an

16

appeal to the Court of Federal Claims, and that

17

provision exists in this very contract.

18

That's wrong under the statute;

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­

I'm sorry.

You're going

19

too fast for me, and I don't think I remember this in

20

your reply brief.

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I think it is.

It's

22

in a footnote of our reply brief, and it cites to

605(b).

requires -- right now we have an absolute entitlement to

Alderson Reporting Company

That is what even the deferment agreement says that

to have to inquire whether it was valid.

away" means everybody keeps the money he has.
GENERAL KATYAL:

to me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the

Court to set aside the contracting officer's decision,

happenstance.

don't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem

with their argument, because they are saying:

contract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations

for default and convert them all into terminations for

16

convenience when the state-secrets privilege is being

invoked.

you might have it within the military, you know, the

11

equivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might

14

that the need for this Court to be involved is a lot

lower than, say, in the criminal context of Reynolds,

because the government here is a repeat player with

Indeed, I think since the 2003 Federal

So it isn't -- it isn't a

All right.

Let me ask then, I

8

Kennedy's question for a minute?

9

quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how

Would you go back to Justice
I'm -- I -- I don't

10

you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because

11

the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental

12

unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this

13

kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends.

14

It depends on many things.

15

So, would you write this as a matter of

16

constitutional law?

17

as a matter of Federal common law of contracts?

18

Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior

19

knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it?

20

And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of

21

discovery law, which is what the district judge who

22

23

gee, I don't really know.

Alderson Reporting Company

How would you

GENERAL KATYAL:

Sure.

Justice Breyer, I

2

think that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this

3

contractual dispute for a couple of reasons.

4

can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to

5

other things, but also the whole notion of due process

6

in contracts is odd, because the government has waived

7

its sovereign immunity only since 1855.

8

any freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim

9

fundamental fairness on contracts.

Not just

They don't have

I think that is

10

implicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't

11

have that right.

12

And so, the question becomes, is there some

13

extra protection the courts should give here akin to the

14

one in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the

15

government using state-secrets information?

16

the answer to that is "no," because parties can work

17

that out themselves ex ante.

18

And I think

And so, my answer to you is -- I think it

19

was option B -- to use the contract as the -- and

20

contractual interpretation as the basic rule for a

21

decision here.

22

was done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the

7

That's not the way the contract law

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I do think that with

8

respect to this, in this -- you know,

thousands-and-thousands-of-page contract, I think that

10

this specific set of issues could have been worked out

11

in advance and, I do think, was worked out in advance.

12

They knew, going in, that they bore the burden of

13

walking into court, paying their attorneys, and

14

everything else, to challenge the decision of the

15

contracting officer.

16

the government had an undoubted right to the

17

unliquidated progress payments.

18

And they also knew at that moment

The contract they signed distinguished

19

between liquidated progress payments, as to which the

government has no right, and unliquidated payments, as

to which default termination automatically gave that to

the government.

billion, because the government hasn't given it to us

25

yet.

And the argument they're advancing here

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that unliquidated?

2

I didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35

3

unliquidated?

4

GENERAL KATYAL:

Because the contract

5

specified two payment streams.

One is the work that

6

they had reviewed and understood and said -- the

7

government had said this is good work, we're going to

8

pay you for it; and other work which are claims that

9

they have made but they haven't actually been approved

10

by the government.

And I think Mr. Phillips -- I don't

11

think that there's any sort of evidence that -- or

12

certainly nothing that the courts below found that says

13

that the -- that they had a right to the

14

unliquidated progress payments.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

the -- what's the other 1.25 billion -­

GENERAL KATYAL:

The 1.2 -­

What's the other?

What's

for?

seeking on top of -­

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

23

GENERAL KATYAL:

-- keeping 1.35 billion, as

24

I understand it, is costs -- is extra costs incurred

25

under the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billion

that was in the initial contract.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, do you have the

3

citation to that footnote you referred to in the -- the

4

605(b)?

5

I can find it later, but -­
GENERAL KATYAL:

It's page 32, and I'd also

6

refer the Court to the court of appeals appendix page

7

19567, which is the page of the contract itself that

8

incorporates the provision.

9

FAR 52.233-1(h), and it says that -- it mandates

The provision is

10

performance and compliance with the contract even when

11

there -- in the contracting officer's decision, even

12

when a decision is under appeal.

13

So it is not the case whatsoever that their

14

filing of this claim somehow vacated the contracting

15

officer's decision.

16

this Federal Court reverses the Federal Circuit -­

The only way that will happen is if

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

GENERAL KATYAL:

19
20

So your view is that -­

-- and grants them

affirmative -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that the complaint

21

did not stay their obligation to pay you; that provision

22

required them to pay you -­

23

GENERAL KATYAL:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

That's correct.
-- the -- the

unliquidated sums?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

GENERAL KATYAL:

That's right.

At that

2

moment they had to pay.

They knew that, and they in

3

fact sent a bank letter and so on -- this is Joint

4

Appendix 329 -- saying please don't do that.

5

we entered into a deferment agreement, but we have an

6

absolute right to that money right now regardless of

7

what -- we don't need an affirmative decision from this

8

Court in order to get that money.

9

Court to simply stay its hand and follow the Hippocratic

And then

We're asking the

10

principle of doing no harm in a world in which the -­

11

the Court can't decide who's right and who's wrong.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If that -- if you're

13

right about that, the government's absolute right, could

14

you withhold it from other contracts of these

15

contractors?

16

GENERAL KATYAL:

That's absolutely right.

17

The -- the Federal rules and the Contract Disputes Act

18

provide us an offset so that we could -- we don't have

19

to actually seek the 1.35 billion from their coffers, as

20

he colorfully called it, "reaching into"; we can just

21

offset it against future contracts, and the Federal

22

courts would be out of the business altogether about

23

that 1.35 billion.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you get the extra

money without having to go to court because then they'd

GENERAL KATYAL:

And, again, Mr. Chief

Justice, that's the contract to which they signed.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Justice Kennedy, I think the answer to your

11

question is that this case can properly be decided on

12

Federal common law principles, and indeed I would ask

13

the Court to apply those same -- those contract

14

principles in this context to -- it's just on the Joint

15

Appendix on page 209.

16

General Katyal focuses on what happens when

17

the contracting officer takes some action.

18

leaves out is the following sentence:

19

shall have the right of appeal under the disputes clause

20

from any determination by the contracting officer.

21

What he

The contractor

And while the General spends an awful lot of

22

time talking about what do you do in the Article III

23

context, the Contracting Disputes Act specifically

24

allows to us go to a board of contract appeals, which is

25

not an Article III institution.

And I guarantee you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

that the government would be making exactly the same

2

argument if we had taken that particular route.

3

It seems to me the case ought not to be

4

decided on the basis of this kind of a technical

5

assessment.

6

of sort of where the rights are and what's the

7

fundamental change and who's making the shift in one

8

direction or the other.

9

The case ought to be decided on the basis

And if you do that -- and Justice Ginsburg,

10

you specifically asked the question, am I asking for all

11

or nothing?

12

come up with a principled basis to adopt precisely the

13

principle that Justice Scalia pointed out, which is to

14

say we will stay our hand, we'll -- we will not uphold

15

the -- the contracting officer's decision, and therefore

16

we're not going to say there's a default -­

No.

I think there's no question you can

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

But you say -­

-- but we're not going to go

19

the extra mile and say it's a termination for

20

convenience.

21
22
23

The Court can certainly do that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

is another way?

So you are saying there

There's a middle way?

MR. PHILLIPS:

There is a middle way.

24

There's no question about it.

All I was saying in

25

response to Justice Scalia's question was, you know -Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

On what principle of

law?
MR. PHILLIPS:

On the principle of law that

4

if you don't have a contract for default, then there's

5

no basis for -- and we're not going to do any more than

6

that; we can't decide who's right and who's wrong, and

7

therefore we're not going to enforce the contracting

8

officer's decision, or we're not going to do anything

9

more than this.

We're going to leave the status quo

10

ante, which means before the contracting officer

11

declared that there was a default under these

12

circumstances.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

principle of our jurisprudence, right?

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17
18
19
20

It's the "go away"

I actually get that a lot,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Phillips, I understood

your papers as making only a constitutional claim.
MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I don't read that,

21

Justice Kagan.

I mean, we -- we certainly have a due

22

process argument in there, but embedded in there as well

23

is -- are a number of references to Federal common law

24

principles as a -- as a -- obviously nonconstitutional

25

basis on which to rule in our favor.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And I -- I mean, I think the Court ought to

2

be informed in -- in making its determination about how

3

to interpret the contracting arrangement by the question

4

of whether this is fundamentally unfair and

5

unconscionable, obviously, but you would probably do

6

that as a matter of Federal common law principles in

7

trying to decide on the -- on contracting principles or

8

not.

9

At the end of the day, Your Honors, this has

10

been fundamentally unfair, and we would ask for the

11

Court to reverse.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr.

Phillips, General.
