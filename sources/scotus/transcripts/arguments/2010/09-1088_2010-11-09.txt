CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 09-1088, Cullen v. Pinholster.
Mr. Bilderback.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. BILDERBACK, II,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BILDERBACK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
There are three main points I wish to

11

emphasize to the Court this morning:

12

California Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pinholster's claim

13

of ineffective assistance of counsel on its merits,

14

Federal habeas corpus relief is unavailable under 28

15

U.S.C. section 2254(d)(1) unless Mr. Pinholster first

16

met his burden of demonstrating that the State court

17

rejection of his claim was unreasonable.

18

that in this case, and thus the lower courts erred in

19

granting him habeas corpus relief.

20

First, because the

He did not do

Second, because Mr. Pinholster never even

21

alleged, let alone proved, that he could not have

22

presented the factual basis upon which the Ninth Circuit

23

predicated its decision to grant relief when he was in

24

the State court, 2254(e)(2) should have been a barrier

25

to the State court Federal evidentiary hearing.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could we just clarify

2

what you mean by "factual basis"?

3

didn't -- because he didn't present the expert opinion

4

with the diagnosis, or because the diagnosis was based

5

on a series of facts that, to me, appear to have been

6

presented fully to the State court; is that correct?

7

MR. BILDERBACK:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To be precise, he

Yes.

the fact that the defense attorneys only worked 6 hours,

MR. BILDERBACK:

He did not allege 6 and a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Not specifically, but he

said that his counsel didn't prepare.
MR. BILDERBACK:

That's precisely correct,

Your Honor, but the court -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And he pointed to the

8

fact that counsel basically said at the trial, I didn't

9

think we were going to have a mitigation hearing, as

10
11

proof of that, correct?
MR. BILDERBACK:

He did point to that, Your

12

Honor, but we would note that the 6-and-a-half-hour

13

conclusion drawn by the Ninth Circuit and drawn by the

14

district court is not fairly supported by the record.

15

But, putting that aside, the principal fact

16

that we are focusing on that we think is a new and

17

significant change in the factual posture of the case

18

from the time he was in State court to the time that he

19

was in Federal court is the diagnosis of organic brain

20

damage by the expert, which is not simply the opinion of

21

the expert, but a question of material fact that was

22

relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in its decision to

23

grant relief.

25

The failure to ever tell the California
Supreme Court that petitioner has organic brain damage

and the centrality of that factual determination on the

difference between the facts upon which the State -­

with which the State court was presented and the facts

5

that the Ninth Circuit granted -- rested its decision to

6

grant relief.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bilderback, I know that

8

that's the principal fact that you rely upon, that

9

there's a difference, but could you give us a full

10

catalogue of the facts that are different in the Federal

11

court record from the facts that are different in the

12

State court record?

14

unreasonable.

12

It speaks only an

Could you address the difference in the

13

language and why that difference doesn't suggest that

14

the question of an unreasonable legal determination

15

should be based on the record before the Federal court,

16

which in most instances, the vast majority of instances,

17

is just a State court record?

18

MR. BILDERBACK:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

That's correct, Your Honor.
But there are exceptions

in (e)(2) for hearings.

21

MR. BILDERBACK:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why shouldn't the

23

first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal

24

determination in light of the record before the court?

25

MR. BILDERBACK:

Because subdivisions (d)(1)

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and (d)(2) serve very different purposes.

2

(d)(2) is concerned with determinations of fact, and the

3

additional language that the Court points to was an

4

attempt to limit the bases upon which a Federal court

5

could overturn a State court factual determination.

6

Subdivision

Prior to the passage of AEDPA, a Federal

7

court could overturn a State court determination of fact

8

not simply because the evidence was lacking, which is

9

the current state of the law, but also because it found

10

some sort of procedural defect or a number of other

11

bases that had grown up in the common law.

12

passage of AEDPA, Congress limited the bases upon which

13

a State court factual determination could be rejected to

14

only one.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

With the

Are you suggesting that

16

if a State court gets a proffer of evidence from a State

17

petitioner who says, I have a billing record that shows

18

that my attorney worked only 6 hours; and the State

19

says, we're not admitting that billing record because it

20

hasn't been authenticated, so we're not looking at that

21

fact; and the Federal habeas looks at what was proffered

22

and says, this is authentication under any rule, State

23

or Federal -- it was improperly admitted, so their legal

24

determination was wrong?

The billing record could show 5

minutes, so that there's no dispute that the person

3

spent essentially no time on mitigation, didn't present

4

anything.

5

suggesting that a habeas corpus court is no longer

6

permitted to look at that new evidence?

7

MR. BILDERBACK:

The clearest case you want.

You're

is that the language of (d)(2) was designed to limit the

MR. BILDERBACK:

No, but I'm going back

to (d)(1).

14
15

Of course, our case doesn't

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not symmetrical,

though.
MR. BILDERBACK:

I would -- I would

19

disagree, because I believe the symmetrical language in

20

(d)(1) is the limitation on the Federal court's reliance

21

on lower Federal court authority to overturn State court

22

factual determinations.

23

Prior to the passage of AEDPA, lower Federal

24

courts were free to look to their own prior precedent,

25

the prior precedent of the circuit courts, to say that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the State court determination of a question of law was

2

unreasonable.

3

subdivision (d)(1), which has to do with questions of

4

law and mixed questions, the additional language

5

narrowed the focus to a new and more limited basis for

6

Federal review or to find the State court determination

7

unreasonable.

8
9

In both statutes -- statute -­

In (d)(2), there is this symmetrical
limiting language which overturned what had historically

10

been several bases for rejecting a State court factual

11

determination.

12

But, in both sections, the law is clear that

13

the - the examination is of the application that was

14

conducted by the State court.

15

in the past tense, and the very concept of

16

reasonableness compels the conclusion that the State

17

court determination can only fairly be read in light of

18

-- in light of the facts that were squarely presented to

19

the State court.

20

where all of the facts before the State court are

21

entirely removed, an entirely new set of facts are

22

proven up in the Federal court, and we're going to say

23

that, notwithstanding that wholesale change in the

24

factual basis of the claim, that the State court

25

determination was not merely wrong, but unreasonable.

The section itself speaks

Otherwise we could be in a situation

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And it is this notion of unreasonableness,

2

and it is the primacy of the State court determination

3

of the claim that is the central feature of the AEDPA

4

reforms to Federal habeas corpus.

5

State court determinations the primary forum for

6

adjudicating Federal constitutional claims, and Federal

7

courts were only supposed to interfere in those

8

determinations reluctantly.

9

language of AEDPA, you'll see that, in -- in many

The point was to make

And if you examine the

10

respects, it mirrors the language of 2244, the "second

11

or successive" language in Federal court.

12

The purpose of AEDPA was to enforce upon

13

Federal courts the same respect for State court

14

determinations of claims that Federal courts showed to

15

their own prior State court determinations of claims.

16

State court determinations of Federal constitutional

17

claims are not lesser creatures deserving of less

18

respect than Federal court determinations of claims.

19

And here they put very specific language in the statute

20

that was designed to ensure that when a Federal court is

21

examining a State court determination of a claim, it

22

limits itself to only those facts that were before the

23

State court.

24

determination is done in light of the record before the

the way that you are proposing, which is to start with

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and only if the

2

petitioner wins under (d)(1), on proving that the

decision on the facts before that -- the State court

4

were reasonable, that you ever get to (e)(2).

5

MR. BILDERBACK:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's why -­
Why is that logical?

7

Why isn't it logical to start with (e)(2), which is -­

8

it says in (e)(2) these are the prerequisites to having

9

a hearing, you prove you're entitled to it.

Why are we

10

excluding those facts from the decision makers'

11

consideration?

12

MR. BILDERBACK:

Well, setting aside for the

13

moment a point I hope to get to, which is I believe that

14

they did fail under (e)(2); but assuming the premise of

15

the question, which is that (e)(2) has been satisfied

16

and that the Federal evidentiary hearing might be

17

appropriate, it makes no more sense to conduct a Federal

18

evidentiary hearing before you conduct a (d)(1) analysis

19

than it would to conduct a Federal evidentiary hearing

20

before you do the 2254(a) analysis of whether there's a

21

Federal question, the 2254(b) and (c) analysis of

22

whether the claim is properly exhausted, or the 2254(d)

claim was reasonable.

confusion on these issues if the -- I think the plain

language of 2254(d)(1), which is retrospective and

MR. BILDERBACK:

Well, the -- the question

4

-- and I think the question the Court's asked seems to

5

implicate the ACLU's hypothetical in their amicus brief.

6

But the problem with doing the (e)(2) analysis before we

7

examine the reasonableness of the State court

8

determination is those new facts that were never

9

presented to the State court are going to, as it did in

10

this case, confound the court's analysis of whether the

11

State court determination was reasonable.

12

If new facts arise which call into question

13

some factual determination by the State court, or let's

14

say new evidence arises which calls into question a

15

State court factual determination, of course that

16

implicates subdivision (d)(2) and that -- that

17

implicates subdivision (e)(1), neither of which are in

18

play in our case.

19

might find ourselves asking the question, depending upon

the nature of the new evidence, whether or not that

evidence is of such a caliber that it's going to

transform the claim.

instructive on that, and that is the 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii)

10

analyses of when a claim that was previously adjudicated

11

on the merits by a Federal court can be revisited in a

12

subsequent petition that is filed in the Federal court.

13

If the nature of the claim is so fundamentally changed

14

that we're going to consider it a new claim, then it is

and some of this I acknowledge is idiosyncratic to this

But the problem with following a procedure

that allows the development of evidence notwithstanding

7

the reasonableness of the State court determination is

8

you are very often, if not typically, going to find a

9

situation where, even if the State court determination

10

of the claim was wholly reasonable, the claim has

11

changed based upon these new facts developed for the

12

very first time in Federal court, and then that's going

13

to mean that it's a substantially transformed claim.

2

MR. BILDERBACK:

In my case, I agree that

3

the facts presented to the Federal court were never

presented to the State court, and those facts

5

fundamentally transformed the claim such that the claim

upon which the Ninth Circuit granted relief was never

MR. BILDERBACK:

Well, depending on how the

22

State court reacts to the new evidence.

23

State court erects a procedural bar then, yes, this

Court's well-settled jurisprudence on the question of

25

procedural bars is going to control whether or not we

presented precludes the conclusion that they could not

have presented this evidence to the State court in the

7

exercise of reasonable diligence.

trial had to discover the organic brain damage diagnosis

back to your question of what's a claim.

to present evidence of a particular kind of brain

22

which was bipolar disorder.

MR. BILDERBACK:

Well, of course, a claim is

2

made up of two components, and one of them is -- is the

3

legal theory of the claim, and the other is the factual

4

landscape that we're asking that legal theory to be

5

applied to.

claim as general as the first statement that you made,

Justice Kagan, that my trial attorney gave me

ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase,

So, for example, if someone were to present

that's a claim that's void for vagueness.

Rule 2 requires that you specifically

identify the factual bases of your claim to the Federal

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

2

There has been a lot of discussion about

3

changes from State to Federal court, but if we limit

4

ourselves, even to the evidence that was only presented

5

in State court, the mitigation evidence demonstrates an

6

objectively unreasonable application of Strickland, and

7

the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed on

8

that basis alone.

MR. KENNEDY:

We do have to live with the

12

basis that the Ninth Circuit wrote, and the Ninth

13

Circuit majority en banc said that there were alternate

14

bases for granting relief.

15

Federal hearing was compelling, but it specifically

16

stated that if you set aside the new mental health

17

theories that were introduced in Federal court and

18

focused only on the historical upbringing and childhood,

19

and the mental health facts alleged in State court, that

20

basis and that basis alone would support a finding.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for

status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he

22

looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist

23

said, look, there's nothing here, and he went through

24

all the stuff that was there; and, in fact, after the

25

Federal evidentiary hearing, he said, well, in light of
27
Alderson Reporting Company

this new evidence, I'm still correct; and objectively

2

unreasonable for this lawyer to say, look, my best bet

3

is to put his mother on the stand, that that might

everybody says, as opposed to putting on all this

to proceed on that basis.

What about the argument

18

that a good deal of mitigation evidence came out during

19

the trial on the guilt?

20

MR. KENNEDY:

It did not come out, Justice

21

Ginsburg.

A few little pieces of information were given

22

by Mrs. Brashear, Mr. Pinholster's mom.

23

no relationship of how his traumatic head injuries then

24

affected him and caused him damage.

25

presentation was incomplete.

But there was

And so the -- the

And even the State's own

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expert, Dr. Stalberg, after he had actually seen all the

2

documents that he would have wanted to receive if he was

3

doing a mitigation mental health phase, he said it was

4

profoundly misleading.

5

And it was.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

And this goes

6

back to Justice Scalia's question.

The question which

7

we granted -- question 1 is whether the Federal court

8

may reject a State court adjudication of a petitioner's

9

claim as unreasonable based on a factual predicate for

10

the claim that petitioner could have presented in the

11

State court but did not.

12

talking about in response to Justice Ginsburg.

13

And that describes what you're

Now, the Petitioner, unaccountably, has told

14

us a few minutes ago that this is a new claim, which I

15

think changes the whole question.

16

the claim is whether there's ineffective assistance of

17

counsel by reason of the mitigation evidence.

18

that case, we go back to Justice Scalia's opening

19

question to you:

20

evidence, evidence that was not in the State hearing?

21

And that's the question, whether or not they can do

22

that, if this evidence could have been presented.

But it seems to me

And in

Was it the court relied on different

23

And certainly it could have been presented.

24

MR. KENNEDY:

25

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

Ninth Circuit did make alternative rulings, but turning
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the question of the new evidence, we believe the new

2

evidence was properly considered, although the court

3

made it clear that it would affirm based only on what

4

was on State court, because that showing was so

5

substantial in and of itself.

6

But, turning to the new evidence, there is a

7

reason things like this happen.

In California, the

8

claim was denied without any hearing and without any

9

explanation.

And then the -- the case moves to Federal

10

court.

11

starts bringing forth its mental health theory to rebut

12

the offered theory and starts to question whether or not

13

Dr. Stalberg, who is our expert, has a neurology license

14

and can opine on how epilepsy affects intent and

15

culpability.

And for the first time, it's the State that

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just to pause for a

17

moment, you said there was no hearing in the State

18

court.

19

to the established procedures, assumed everything you

20

wanted to show was true.

21

mean, you were not going to be in any better position

22

after a hearing than you were before the State court.

Well, that was because the State court, pursuant

23

MR. KENNEDY:

It's a little bit much.

I

Mr. Chief Justice, the

24

California Supreme Court didn't tell us what I -- what

25

they did.

It is true that there is a procedure for
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provisionally assuming facts are true.

2

that they did that here.

They didn't say

3

And the backdrop against how this case

4

happened in State court is we presented all of the

5

allegations with affidavits in support of them, and the

6

California Supreme Court issued an OSC, which normally

7

means they think if the showing is true, it's got to be

8

granted, and there has to be a hearing and a ruling that

9

describes the reasoning.

10

Then the State filed in State court

11

documents, fairly conclusory, saying:

12

believe Dr. Woods.

13

years after the fact.

14

shouldn't believe trial counsel.

15

16

You shouldn't

You shouldn't believe him.

And after that, the State Supreme Court

17

withdraws the OSC and issues a postcard denial.

18

suggests that we didn't get the procedures that are

19

referred to, at least from the State's perspective.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

That

But isn't it the California

21

rule that a hearing had to have been conducted unless

22

they concluded that the petitioner was not entitled to

23

relief based on the facts alleged in the petition?

24
25

MR. KENNEDY:

I think that's the rule,

Justice Alito, but if that is what was done here,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it is the most commonly invoked rule, it was

2

objectively unreasonable, because in light of the

3

presentation that was made in State court -- and I've

4

given the Court some of it -- that was definitely a

5

showing of an unreasonable application of Strickland,

6

because -­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, to get back to the

8

question the Chief Justice asked before, trial counsel

9

did consult a psychiatrist, Dr. Stalberg, and his report

10

was very unfavorable.

11

Now, it's your -- it's your argument that it

12

was ineffective for them not to continue their search

13

for a helpful expert and come upon Drs. Vinogradov and

14

Olson or someone like them during that period of time?

15

Is that -- is that the claim?

16

MR. KENNEDY:

I'm sorry, Justice Alito,

17

that's not my argument.

18

where it would be perfectly acceptable for trial counsel

19

to hire a mental health expert, receive a report, and

20

say, based on what we have, we're not going to use this

21

route.

22

I think there are many times

But it wasn't acceptable here, because what

23

happened here is they hired a mental health expert in

24

the middle of the guilt phase who went down on a Sunday

25

for 1 to 2 hours without any of the documents that he
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

said -- he said -- that he needed to do a proper

2

mitigation investigation.

3

that they had to have known on its face showed

4

Dr. Stalberg did not have enough information to render a

5

competent psychiatric opinion.

6

And he gave them a letter

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- again, it would

7

be helpful -- maybe you can't do this from the top of

8

your head, but when I looked at the Ninth Circuit en

9

banc decision, I found a long discussion on page 79

10

following by Chief Judge Kozinski in dissent, from which

11

I got the impression that the majority was not saying:

12

We think the State court decision here was unreasonable

13

or violated clearly established law, based on the record

14

before the State court on habeas, State habeas.

15

Now, you've just told me in the 70-page

16

opinion by Judge Smith, there's a paragraph or something

17

that says:

18

extra evidence, we still think that looking just at the

19

evidence before the State court habeas, and just at

20

their decision, we think in light of all these things

21

you now are bringing up that that was a -- was an

22

unreasonable application of clearly established Federal

23

law, or at least was based on an unreasonable

24

determination of the facts; in other words, satisfied

25

(d).

7

MR. KENNEDY:

4

I've spent all

that time.

Justice Breyer, the Ninth

8

Circuit said:

"Although Pinholster substituted experts

9

during the proceeding who ultimately developed different

10

mental impairment theories, these experts nonetheless

11

relied on the same background facts that Pinholster" -­

12

"Pinholster presented to the State court.

13

if 2254(e)(2) were to limit the scope of the evidence

14

before us, it would exclude only the new mental

15

impairment theories introduced in federal court, and

16

their exclusion would not affect our result."

17

Accordingly,

Well, there you are, and I

should have asked Justice Scalia beforehand.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Kennedy -­
So you're putting

22

your eggs in the basket that, under AEDPA, what happened

23

here was objectively unreasonable?

24

MR. KENNEDY:

Well -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Or do you want to go

Official

1

on and look at the question on which we granted cert and

2

argue that we should look at the new evidence or that

3

the State court should look at the new evidence?

4

MR. KENNEDY:

Well, we think what happened

5

here was perfectly appropriate for the court to hold a

6

hearing.

7

the Federal court determined that a hearing was

8

appropriate because Pinholster had been diligent in

9

attempting to develop the facts, and that is the test

10
11

No hearing had been held in State court, and

that this Court has set forth in Michael Williams.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, this -- your

12

friend pointed it out, and I have to say it's a logical

13

conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2)

14

that the factual predicate could not have been

15

previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer

16

should have discovered this.

17

And if the former is not true, you don't get a hearing;

18

and if the latter is not true, you don't get relief.

19

MR. KENNEDY:

They both can't be true.

Well, I guess it depends on

20

how one interprets the term "factual predicate," because

21

if we focus on mental health impairments and how

22

impairments affect intent and culpability and how it

23

plays out on the specific facts of the crime, Pinholster

24

did discover those, even though he didn't have discovery

25

or an evidentiary hearing.

He did allege them, and he

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should have been given a hearing where he would have

2

then further developed those facts, just as he did in

3

Federal court, when he received the hearing that he

4

should have received in State court but did not.

5
6

There's nothing wrong with that.

But we

don't need that view -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you go back to

8

Justice Kagan's earlier question of how we draw the

9

line?

10

At what level of generality is sufficient to say

that a factual basis of a claim has been developed?

11
12

MR. KENNEDY:

I think we draw the line by

focusing on what is legally relevant, not a DSM opinion.

13

I have to say, as a long-time public

14

defender, my experience is that the mental health

15

professionals often speak about the legally relevant

16

facts in different ways based on the DSM, but to focus

17

on what matters:

18

affect him?

What was his impairment?

How did it

19

He was, right before the homicides, at the

20

house of a friend in an erratic state, saying he had a

21

message from God, brandishing a knife and putting it

22

into the door.

23

evaluation, said that that was extraordinarily important

24

to him, because it showed that this was not a cold and

25

calculated murderer, as he thought when he didn't have

Dr. Stalberg, who did this mid-trial

36
Alderson Reporting Company

impaired person.

epilepsy and mental health condition, he was

4

hypersensitive.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose a petitioner

6

in the State post-conviction proceeding proffers an

7

affidavit from one mental health expert alleging one

8

type of mental disorder, and then after relief is denied

9

in the State court, the petitioner files in Federal

10

court and asks for an evidentiary hearing at which the

11

petitioner is going to call a dozen highly distinguished

12

mental health experts who will testify to a very

13

different mental disorder.

14

developed the factual predicate for that claim in the

15

State proceeding?

16

-- it reviews those allegations in light of the State

court record.

The State doesn't blindly
It

And, in this case, as the Court indicates,

11

the State court record plainly showed that the

12

allegation that they did nothing to prepare for the

13

penalty phase was false, and, indeed, the State court

14

records showed that they began preparing for the penalty

15

phase well before the penalty phase began.

16

So the factual allegation that was presented

17

to the State court was not only false, based on the

18

State court record; it was affirmatively disproved

19

during the Federal evidentiary hearing.

5

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And to get home, we now

7

have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some

8

combination of (a) there was nothing to have a hearing

9

about because there's nothing here that lets you have a

10

hearing; or (b) there was something to have a hearing

11

about because this was so new that it was a new claim,
