ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BOIES:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

11

The district court below found, and it is

12

not disputed here, that the plaintiff fulfilled all of

13

the requirements of Rule 23(a) for class certification.

14

The district court also found, and the court of appeals

15

affirmed, that the plaintiffs demonstrated all of the

16

requirements for class certification under 23(b)(3)

17

except for the Fifth Circuit's loss causation

18

requirement.

19

not there was an efficient market was not disputed.

20

was conceded that we have an efficient market here.

21

There were no challenges -­

22

The court below recognized that whether or

What if that had

been disputed?

Is that something that can be disputed

at the certification stage?

MR. BOIES:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -­

Mr. Boies, what's the

difference then?

7

certification stage, but not the question of price

8

impact?

9

Why could that be disputed at the

MR. BOIES:

Because the issue of efficient

10

market goes to the presumption of reliance, and if the

11

court holds at the certification stage that there is no

12

efficient market, then the basis for presuming

13

class-wide reliance is impacted.

14

situation in which the common issues do not predominate

15

over the individualized issues.

16

respect to loss causation because, as Respondent

17

concedes here, loss causation is a common issue.

18
19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so you can have a

That cannot happen with

Well, how about materiality?

Could you rebut materiality at the certification stage?

20

MR. BOIES:

No, Your Honor, we don't think

21

you can rebut materiality at the -- at the certification

22

stage.

23

loss causation is in addition to materiality.

24
25

I would note that under the Fifth Circuit rule,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, now I'm a little

confused, because the efficient market and materiality
4
Alderson Reporting Company

are all part of the prima facie case triggering the

2

Basic presumption.

3

of that case but not another part of that case?

4

So, why couldn't you rebut one part

MR. BOIES:

Because the issue of materiality

5

is something that goes to a class-wide common issue.

6

The issue of reliance can go to whether or not issues

7

predominate or not.

8

common issues predominate or not.

MR. BOIES:

The Basic presumption of

reliance, yes, Your Honor.

For example, if you were to

22

take a situation in which you -- not present here, but

23

where you disputed whether or not the market was

24

efficient or not, that is something that could be

25

decided at the class certification stage.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can it be rebutted by proof

2

other than proof generally disproving the efficiency of

the market?

4

MR. BOIES:

We believe under the Court's

5

decision in Basic that that is something that is

reserved for trial, that -- that rebuttal.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. BOIES:

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's pretty thin,

isn't it?

opinion issued at a time when conditional class

13

certification was permitted.

14

to support that?

It's a -- it's dictum in a footnote in an

I don't from this Court, Your

Do you have anything in the

rule to support that?

MR. BOIES:

Anything in the rule?

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. BOIES:

Yes.

Well, I think the -- I think

22

what the rule does is it talks about whether issues of

23

common issue predominate over individualized issue.

24

since this is something that would be at the class

25

certification stage, not creating individualized issues,

we would think that is something that's reserved for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Boies, how would it

4

work in your view of the case?

That is, you say that

5

the loss, what's been called loss causation, is not

6

something to be decided at the certification stage, but

7

at the trial or summary judgment.

8

would the plaintiff class prove loss causation?

9

the reliance hurdle that you have surmounted, now you're

Well, how -- how
Given

10

in -- you have your class certified; how does the class

11

prove loss causation.

12

MR. BOIES:

As -- as this Court indicated in

13

Dura, in order to prove loss causation, you must

14

demonstrate that you had either an increase in the

15

prices, and this -- this assumes that you are concealing

16

negative information; the reverse would be true if you

17

were concealing positive information -- an increase at

18

the time that the concealment took place or a decline

19

when the actual facts were revealed.

20

And it would be required at summary judgment

21

by a summary judgment standard, and at trial by a trial

22

standard, and at the pleading stage by a pleading

23

standard, for the plaintiff to make out that case.

24

other words, there are three times loss causation is

25

tested:

Pleadings, summary judgment, and trial.
7

In

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

question is whether a fourth test should be interposed

2

at the class certification stage.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, doesn't a lack

4

of response to a disclosure -- couldn't it be in some

5

situations reflective of an inefficient market?

6

MR. BOIES:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it

7

could.

I think that you -- you could very well have a

8

situation in which if you demonstrated a lack of

9

response, that could impact the issue of efficiency; and

10

I think that would be an issue that-- that in a proper

11

case where unlike this one it was presented -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why is it?

Why is this

13

case -- why can't you pigeonhole this case into that

14

argument, which, it appears what your -- what the

15

Respondents have done is move away from the loss

16

causation proof and gone to the issue of whether they

17

rebutted reliance or not.

18

MR. BOIES:

The -- the problem is, as the

19

Fifth Circuit noted at page 335 of the F.3d report,

20

efficiency of this market was conceded below.

21

words, the Respondents conceded that this market was

22

efficient?

23

presented, and the rebuttal issue was not -- was not

24

presented in this case.

25

In other

So that issue -- that issue was not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you

talked about loss causation.

2

that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing,

3

that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the

4

presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing

5

that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was

6

nothing that could justify the presumption.

7

The Respondents assert

Would you be satisfied if we just said that

8

we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss

9

causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the

10

Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the

11

theory that Respondents assert they have already

12

adopted?

13

seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss

14

causation.

15
16
17

I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it

MR. BOIES:

Well, it depends on how the

Fifth Circuit then construes reliance.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they -- they would

18

construe it the way Respondents say they have already

19

construed it.

20

MR. BOIES:

Your Honor, I think that if they

21

simply changed the wording and called loss causation

22

reliance, obviously it wouldn't make any difference.

23

But as this Court indicated in Basic, and just last

24

month in Matrixx, loss causation and reliance are two

25

distinct elements.

And the reason that's important in
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this particular context is that reliance can create a

2

situation where you have individualized issues

3

predominating over common issues.

4

Loss causation can't because, as Respondents

5

concede here, loss causation is a class-wide issue.

6

Either -- there either is loss causation or is not loss

7

causation.

8

element of the merits case.

judgment, and trial.

11

to the Rule 23 standard.

12

It is one that we must

But it is not something that goes

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think what you've said is

13

that there's really no difference between loss causation

14

and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit

15

found.

16

MR. BOIES:

No, Your Honor.

I did not mean

17

to say that.

I think that there is a difference.

I

18

think there's a -- I think there are -- there are two

19

differences.

20

Respondents say and what the Fifth Circuit says.

21

Fifth Circuit talks about loss causation, says it's in

22

addition to efficient market, does not talk about

23

reliance.

There's a difference between what

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. BOIES:

Right.

There's also a difference
10

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

between what Respondents say and what this Court has

2

said in Basic and Matrixx and the other cases, in terms

3

of what is required to prove for class certification.

4

What is required to prove for class certification under

5

Rule 23, unless and until Rule 23 is changed, is that

6

common issues predominate.

7

predominate even with respect to what the Respondents

8

here argue because -- because what they argue, just like

9

loss causation, is a common issue.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Common issues will

would want us to say that and not just say that loss

Yes,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you see or what

16

difference do you see between their loss causation

17

evidence and an inefficient market?

18

assuming there was no stipulation in this case, do you

19

see any difference in -- in how they could use the fact

20

that other information affected the market and not this

21

one?

22

evidence that they could marshal to show that this is an

23

inefficient market?

24
25

Could they -­

Or is it your theory of the case that there is no

MR. BOIES:

I don't believe under this

Court's decision in Basic that, given the actual
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objective facts that have been admitted -- it's a very

2

public market, very widespread distribution of

3

information, a lot of analysts are reporting on it -- I

4

don't believe that as a objective factual matter they

5

would be able ever to demonstrate that this was not an

6

efficient market.

7

If you had a much smaller market, indeed if

8

you -- if you had a market as the Court was considering

9

in Basic, which was a much smaller market, much less

10

public, much less analyst support, there may be areas in

11

which they -- they could rebut it.

12

what we all know about the Halliburton stocks -- widely

13

traded, large number of shares traded, a lot of

14

analysts, a lot of public information -- I don't believe

15

under this Court's decision in Basic you could conclude

16

reasonably that that was not an efficient market.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I think, given

What do you say to -- to the

18

following argument, that there are some economists who

19

say that, even in a market that is generally efficient,

20

there can be instances in which the market does not

21

incorporate certain statements into the price of a

22

stock; and therefore even when it is demonstrated that

23

the market meets the test for efficiency that the lower

24

courts have settled upon in the wake of Basic, the

25

defendant in a -- in a class action where there is
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reliance on the Basic presumption should be permitted at

2

the class certification stage to prove that the

3

allegedly fraudulent statements had no impact on price,

4

and by doing that destroy the theory that the class

5

relied on the statements, because they relied on the

6

price which incorporated the statements?

7

MR. BOIES:

I -- I think, Your Honor, that

8

if you have a situation in which the proof is

9

class-wide, it is something that goes only to summary

10

judgment or trial.

11

certification stage.

12

whether somebody is relying on an efficient market, that

13

is distinct from whether a particular statement was or

14

was not actionable.

15

It does not go to the class
With respect to the issue of

In other words, the summary judgment issue,

16

the trial issue, is whether the particular statement was

17

actionable and that includes all of the things that the

18

court identifies.

19

there is an efficient market, class-wide issues.

20

other words, it's not going to be the case that in a

21

particular instance a statement did not get into the

22

market will affect only one member of the class.

23

going to affect all members of the class.

24

something that is common all of the class members, Rule

25

23 says that is something for trial, not for class

But those issues are going to be, if

Because it is

certification.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, whether there's an

3

efficient market is also common to all members of the

4

class, so why would you make an exception for that?

5

MR. BOIES:

Because if there's no efficient

6

market, then individualized issues are going to

7

predominate.

8

individual issues or common issues are going to

9

predominate.

That is, the test under Rule 23 is whether

If you destroy the efficient market theory

10

in a particular case, then individual issues of reliance

11

can predominate.

12

respect to loss causation or price distortion or any of

13

these other issues that are fundamental to the merits

14

and are common to the entire class, because if there's

15

no loss causation, there's no cause of action.

16

Court held in Dura, there must be loss causation.

17

there's no loss causation there aren't any individual

18

issues to adjudicate.

the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The Fifth Circuit erred in requiring proof

4

of loss causation at class certification for three

5

reasons:

6

not tethered to the Rule 23 requirements; second, it's

7

taking a presumption and requiring plaintiffs to prove

8

it; and third, it's confusing the distinct elements of

9

reliance and loss causation.

10

First, it's conducting a merits inquiry that's

Just to start in with some of the Court's

11

questions:

12

require proof of loss causation?

13

could not be more clear.

14

rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the

15

defendants an opportunity to do that at class

16

certification.

17

plaintiffs that they have to meet in every single case,

18

even if the defendants do not come to court with any

19

evidence.

20

district court in this case realized.

21

First, Justice Scalia's:

Does the court

The Fifth Circuit

It is not talking about

It is putting an affirmative burden on

And that is a very heavy burden, as the

And just to make this as concrete as

22

possible, loss causation is the question at the end of

23

the day, whether the price decline that caused the

24

losses was sufficiently related to the earlier alleged

25

material misstatement and whether there was any other
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cause that could have led to the price decline.

2

So if a plaintiff cannot come in and prove

3

loss causation, there could be many reasons for that.

4

It may be because the market is not efficient.

5

also be because there's no material misstatement.

6

it could also be, as this Court recognized in Dura, that

7

there was a material misstatement, it did inflate the

8

stock price, but then other causes such as a bad economy

9

or other news about the company came along, and that's

10

what caused the stock price to drop.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It could
But

Justice -­

But you acknowledged that

12

if the cause was the fact that the market was not

13

efficient, that could be raised at the certification

14

stage.

15

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, that's certainly what

16

the Court suggested in Basic and what the courts of

17

appeals have done, is to say that that's a threshold

18

showing that is sufficiently collateral to the merits

19

that it needs to be made, so that the presumption can be

20

invoked in the first instance.

21

But these ideas about rebutting the

22

presumption by showing that at the end of the day the

23

plaintiff can't prove its case, these are things, as Mr.

24

Boies said, that stand or fall on a class-wide basis.

25

And the real problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that it did not tie its proof of loss causation to

2

the requirements of Rule 23.

3

loss causation stands or falls on a class-wide basis.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Everyone agrees here that

The rule isn't, I take it

5

-- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the

6

issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged

7

at the certification stage.

8

that broad, do we?

9

We don't have a rule that's

Or am I missing a point?

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, that's what Rule 23,

10

23(b)(3), which is the one at issue here -- the question

11

is do common issues predominate over individual ones.

12

What you're trying to answer is can this group of people

13

proceed together, not can this group of people make out

14

their case.

15
16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose there's no

demonstrated basis that that common issue exists?
MS. SAHARSKY:

Then I think the plaintiff

18

should lose at the 12(b)(6) stage, and that is a stage

19

that has real bite after this Court's decision in Dura

20

and after the PSLRA.

21

requirements that apply.

22

lose at summary judgment on the issue of loss causation,

23

for example, because, A, either they don't allege a

24

price drop, B, they don't connect the price drop to the

earlier distortion of the market when there's a material

2

There can be many reasons that they lose at

3

that merits stage, but class certification is not a

4

merits stage, and the Fifth Circuit made it one because

5

of its own policy judgments about the effects of class

6

certification.

And with all due respect to the Fifth

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Class certification

is not a merits determination except with respect to

12

market theory?

13

and you can decide it at the class certification stage?

14

Except with respect to the fraud on the
That you can; that is a merits inquiry

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And except, just to add to

15

the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market

16

theory?

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right.

You're asking

18

is this theory going to be available to the plaintiffs

19

at trial, and the way that the plaintiffs show that the

20

theory is available to them is by establishing an

21

efficient market and saying that they traded within the

22

time period while the price was distorted.

23

like establishing any other threshold inquiry that would

24

make evidence or a legal theory available at trial.

25

It's just

But the question the Court is supposed to be
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

asking at the 23, at the Rule 23 stage, the class

2

certification stage, is not can these people win on the

3

merits.

And that's a question the Fifth Circuit was

4

asking.

The question it's supposed to ask is can this

5

group of people proceed together.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

You seem to -- maybe I don't

7

understand your argument, but you and Mr. Boies seem to

8

be arguing that whether there is a common question -­

9

that it is a common question whether there is a common

10

question, and therefore that has to wait until the

11

And

That threshold showing is

Justice Kagan, I take your point that there

is -- that even the question of whether the market is

efficient is a common one, so perhaps one could

25

logically say:

Well, they have a common issue on the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

efficiency of the market; why should they even have to

2

show that at class certification?

3

in Basic, and the courts of appeals have said, it's

4

reasonable in that case since it's so divorced from the

5

merits to require a threshold showing to even allow them

6

to invoke the presumption at the outset.

7

But this Court said

But that is very, very different from what

the Fifth Circuit said in this case.

in this case said basically:

The Fifth Circuit

Prove your whole case.

You don't just have to prove that there was a price

11

decrease; you have to prove that there was an initial

12

material misstatement, that it distorted the stock

price, that it led to a price decrease and that the

price decrease can't be, can't be shown by any other

efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they

come in at the back end and they say:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID STERLING

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. STERLING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

6

Basic recognized that, absent the class-wide

7

presumption of fraud on the market reliance, individual

8

issues of reliance predominate, as they do in any other

9

fraud context.

Consequently, when a district court,

10

after the rigorous analysis required by Rule 23, finds

11

that the presumption is unavailable or rebutted,

12

reliance ceases to be a class-wide issue.

element?

11

MR. STERLING:

We are not defending all of

12

the language in Oscar, clearly, but the basic test in

13

the Fifth Circuit, as our case made clear on pages 116a

14

and 119a of the petition appendix, is not loss

15

causation; it's price impact, because Basic says at page

16

248 any showing that severs the link between the

17

misrepresentation and the stock price defeats the

18

presumption.

19

showing that the stock price was not distorted by the

20

misrepresentation defeats the presumption.

21

Basic makes clear on that same page that a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Sterling, if I

22

think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar

23

said that loss causation needs to be shown at the

25

correct statement of the law; is that correct?

MR. STERLING:

We do agree with that,

Justice Kagan.

3

loss causation as this Court knows it in Dura; the test

4

is simply price impact.

5

recognized -- and the Fund recognized this below on page

6

551a of the Joint Appendix -- their only burden under

7

the Fifth Circuit caselaw was to show price impact, and

8

they could show it either of two ways.

9

show this, page 116 and 119a of the joint appendix.

10

But our opinion made clear that it's not

And the Fifth Circuit

Their papers

They can show price inflation upon a

11

misrepresentation, which, as this Court made clear in

12

Dura, is not synonymous with loss causation.

13

that -- and they could not show that here because their

14

own proof showed that none of the alleged

15

misrepresentations moved the market.

16

alternative way to show price impact is simply to show a

17

price decline following a corrective disclosure.

18

Or failing

So, the

And while that showing is similar to loss

19

causation, it's an easier, less rigorous showing of loss

20

causation, because under the price impact test at the

21

Fifth Circuit, all the plaintiff need show is that it's

22

reasonable to infer that some portion of the decline was

23

attributable to the revelation of the truth.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure

what argument you were making in your brief.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

One

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possible argument you could be making is that the

2

plaintiffs have to show a price impact.

3

possible argument you could be making is that you have

4

to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of

5

the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was

6

no price impact.

7

first, even though I would think that the second is the

8

most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument.

9

Another

And you seemed often to be saying the

MR. STERLING:

If we suggested the first,

10

Justice Kagan, I apologize because we did not intend to.

11

Basic puts the initial burden on the defendant to show

12

the absence of price impact, showing that the presumed

13

fact does not exist.

14

Once that threshold showing is made, the

15

burden remains on the plaintiff under Rule 301 and Rule

16

23 to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the

17

market price was in fact, distorted.

the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden of production

8

on the plaintiff and that's contrary to Basic.

9

agree with that.

We -- we

However, in terms of the Fifth

10

Circuit's language that I believe Your Honor's referring

11

to, that is when the Fifth Circuit was discussing the

12

alleged corrective disclosures.

Because the plaintiff could not show that

14

any of the alleged misrepresentations moved the market,

15

they had to rely upon what they claimed were corrective

16

disclosures.

17

price impact.

18

That was the only way they could show

The Fifth Circuit, at various times, looked

19

at each of the alleged corrective disclosures and said

20

that's not a corrective disclosure because it doesn't

21

reveal the truth in any way; it's bad news, but it's

non-culpable bad news.

moment.

2

So what's wrong with the way I understand it?
MR. STERLING:

Justice Breyer, the -- the

3

problem is, we're back to reliance.

4

Basic creates a presumption as an exception to the long

5

understood rule that fraud cases were not appropriate

6

vehicles for class actions because each individual would

have to say, Mr. Smith in your hypothetical, I read

8

Halliburton's statement and I relied upon it.

9

Basic exists -­

Basic said, because that's so impractical

10

cases would never be certified, we're going to say we're

11

going to assume the entire market is like Mr. Smith, and

12

Mr. Smith relies on the integrity of the stock price

13

when the stock price is distorted by the

14

misrepresentation.

15

fact distorted by the misrepresentation, it makes no

16

sense to say everybody relied on the misrepresentation

17

through its effect on the stock price.

18

But if the stock price was not in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I mean, which means that the plaintiff would lose.

21

that the -- that the latter question, whether in fact

the market was affected or not is, is not a common

question.

25

Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a

sets forth a special rule.

Basic is an exception to the

whether the misrepresentation moved the market.

That's

10

all these are -- materiality, whether it was publicly

7

face, with the false statements alleged here, why would

8

it be unreasonable to conclude that the market wouldn't

respond to them?

MR. STERLING:

One reason is because the

11

market deemed the information to be immaterial, the

12

market didn't care about it, the market didn't react to

it.

generally efficient, a market was inefficient for this

just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what

5

else is there?

6

introduce in the way that you're talking about at the

7

certification stage?

I mean, what would not be proper to

8

MR. STERLING:

9

proof of loss causation, and damages.

10

Falsity, scienter, actual

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Fifth Circuit suggested

11

that scienter could come in at the -- at the

12

certification stage.

13

You're disclaiming that?

MR. STERLING:

Footnote 35 of the Fifth

14

Circuit opinion makes clear that it is not requiring

15

scienter.

16

analyzing what is or is not a corrective disclosure, it

17

says it has to do something that suggests that a

18

statement was made that is potentially actionable was

19

false.

20

And all that is, again, is a second way under the Fifth

21

Circuit's test of showing whether there is the necessary

22

price impact to justify certifying a class, or

23

alternatively to determine that individual issues of

24

reliance predominate.

25

The Fifth Circuit says, in response -- in

Otherwise it's not a revelation of the truth.

And allowing the defendants to rebut the

presumption of reliance at the class certification stage

is consistent with this Court's class action case law

3

and with Rule 23.

4

the Rule 23 requirements are not to be presumed, they're

5

not to be assumed, they have to be found.

6

conformance is the test.

7

This Court has consistently said that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Actual

The only requirement

class unless and until it is satisfied that all of the

17

Rule 23 requirements are met; and it makes no sense to

18

say that a court is going to conduct this rigorous

19

analysis and make the Rule 23(b)(3) findings without

20

considering the defendant's rebuttal proof of whether,

21

in fact, there was price impact, because Basic itself

22

says if there is no price impact, the presumption falls

23

away, individual issues of reliance predominate, and the

24

class cannot be certified.

no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make

the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at

the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to

prove that by a preponderance?

presumption does not shift the ultimate burden of proof.

It stays on the party that -- that bears it.

consistent with Rule 23 as well, which puts the burden

on the plaintiff, to prove all of the Rule 23 elements

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that does suggest that

the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world.

That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic

presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to

5

actually prove their case at that very early stage that

6

there was no price impact.

they have to show price impact, but that's not a hard

That issue is out of the case if you lose,

is so significant is precisely because once the class is

to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that

it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut

certified with the certain knowledge that they would

have to be decertified later.

then there's no in terrorem effect.

MR. STERLING:

Well, if it's so certain,

Just when -- that's assuming

19

that the defendant has the wherewithal to stick it out

20

through it all, but the sheer grant of class

21

certification which aggregates hundreds, tens,

thousands -- tens of thousands of these claims together

23

in one big case makes every one of these cases, in

effect, a company case, and it puts huge settlement

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. BOIES:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Thank

you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

Let me respond to Mr. Sterling's statement

10

that all we had to do was show one statistically

11

significant price movement.

12

the briefing, on December 7th of 2001, the Halliburton

13

put out a release that indicated that their prior

14

statements that their asbestos reserves were -- were

15

adequate were not -- were not true.

16

42 percent, more than 42 percent.

17

42.4.

18

As the Court is aware from

The stock dropped
The actual drop was

Expert witnesses calculated that the

19

company's specific drop was slightly larger than that

20

because the market was generally going up that day.

21

it was a dramatic drop.

22

But

Their own expert, as is indicated in the

23

briefing, agreed that there wasn't anything else

24

happening that day other than asbestos news, and so -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
46
Alderson Reporting Company

So you win, so you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage,

2

whatever.

3

So why is it such I big deal to you here?
MR. BOIES:

Because under the -- the Fifth

4

Circuit rule, I understand that counsel disavows the

5

actual language of the Fifth Circuit rule, but it was

6

that language that the district court relied on in

7

failing to certify the class.

8

respect to the Fifth Circuit test, what the Fifth

9

Circuit says is that because the announcement on

And with -- with -- with

10

December 7th did not specifically reference the prior

11

announcements, it cannot be considered a correction of

12

those prior announcements.

13

Indeed, the court, the Fifth Circuit goes

14

even further, and this is at page 338 of the F. Supp.

15

opinion.

16

decide whether the corrective disclosure more probably

17

than not shows that the original estimates or

18

predictions were designed to defraud.

19

It says, quote:

The district court must

So what the Fifth Circuit is doing is it's

20

bringing, even the defrauding aspect, not just the

21

falsity aspect, but the defrauding aspect right into the

22

class certification stage.

23

And I think Justice Scalia's question was

24

exactly on point with respect to discovery, because

25

either they're going to make these merits decisions
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

without discovery or you're going to have all of the

2

discovery before you have the class certification.

3

got to be one or the other.

4

happening is you're converting what Rule 23 says is an

5

issue as to whether common issues predominate into an

6

issue as to what is the strength of the merits claim

7

that the plaintiff has, and while it is true, reliance

8

is part of the merits claim.

9

It's

And in either case what is

The reason reliance is different is because

10

reliance, if it -- if there is no reliance, if there's

11

no efficient market, then reliance can make individual

12

issues predominate, but when the only issue is not a

13

step issue like efficient market, but is a direct merits

14

issue, there isn't any way that you can make individual

15

issues predominate regardless of how you decide it; and

16

loss causation and price distortion are both those kind

17

of common issues; and counsel says he doesn't defend

18

the -- the actual loss causation statements of the -- of

19

the -- of the Fifth Circuit, and what I would ask is

20

whether the Court, if the Court does decide to send it

21

back, that the Court look at what the right standard is

22

for the court below to be applying when it deals with

23

class certification.

24
25

And I would urge the Court that when you
have pleadings, summary judgment, and trial tests for
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

merits questions, then you don't need another merits

2

test on -- at the class certification stage, even if

3

Rule 23 permitted it, which we don't think it does.

4

What Rule 23 is designed to do is simply say are

5

individual issues or common issues going to predominate?

6

And all of the class have the same loss causation, have

7

the same price distortion issues.

8
9

If the Court has no more questions, that
completes my argument.
