PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

we will hear arguments

r.est in Corbitt against New Jersey.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL- ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. SMITH, JR., ESQ,,
OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court t
lit issue in the present case are the sentencing
provisions of th® New Jersey murder statute.

It is our position

that that statute penalises a defendant's right to jury trial
in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as applied to
the states, to the Due Process Clause.
It is also our position that that statute violates
the Equal Protection Clausa of the Fourteenth Amendment by
creating a discriminatory classification.
In effect, there are two penalties for the crime of
first degree or felony murder in New Jersey, depending solely
upon whether a defendant has exercised his right to a jury trial.
If a defendant is willing to enter a non vulfc plea to an
indictment for murder-»*and I should stop for a moment and
indicate that in New Jersey we do not allow guilty picas to
the crime of murder.

A defendant must enter a plea of either

non vulfc or nolo contendere, both of which are basically the
equivalent of a guilty plea.

4
Q

Does it snake any difference for our purposes

whatever difference there may be between non xmlt and nolo
contendere in New Jersey?
MR. SMITH:

None.

In fact, the common practice is

for all pleas to be entered as non vult pleas.
If that defendant enters a non vult plea in a murder
case, he say be sentenced to life imprisonment or to a term of
not more than 30 years.

This is true even though the

defendant, in setting forth a factual basis for his plea, may
admit that he has committed a felony murder.

The judge is not

to make any determination as to the degree of the crime.
Rather, the judge has complete discretion to impose any
sentence which to him appears appropriate.
However, if that same defendant goes to trial on the
earn© facts and is convicted of first degree murder, then he
must receive the mandatory life sentence.
In this case, of course, Mr. Corbitt did go to trial
in a felony murder case, and he was convicted.

Therefore, he

had to receive the mandatory life sentence.
Q

As X understand it, under your system in New

Jersey, if a defondant pleads not guilty, he ifi&y not waive a
jury? is that correct?
MR. SMITH:
Q
plea

That is true.

He cannot have a bench trial on a not-guilty

5
MR. SMXlKs

All trials must be jury trials.

That

is correct.
Q
plea.

He cannot have a bench trial on a not-guilfcy

That is correct, is it not?
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes»

Under the mandatory life sentence, is he eligible

for parole after a number of years?
MR. SMITHt

Under the mandatory life sentence,, he

ia eligible for parole, es I understand if, in 14 years,
eight months, and ten days.
Q

is the usual experience still that he is

actually more often than not released on parol© at that time?
MR. SMITHS

I honestly could not say, Your Honor.

I just know that they are eligible for parole at that time«
In any event, it is clear that in this case, as I
said, Mr. Corbitt went to trial and was convicted of felony
murder? at his sentencing his attorney asked the court to
consider imposing a term of years in the state prison as he
could have dona if Mr. Corbitt had entered a non vult plea.
However, the judge indicated that he was powerless to do so.
Therefore, it is clear that simply because Mr. Corbitt was
convicted at a jury trial, he was denied the right to be
sentenced to a tern of years in the state prison.
We submit that this loss of discretion in the
sentencing judge or lack of sentencing alternatives is a severe*

5

penalty for a defendant to pay simply because ha has exercised
his constitutional right -to a jury trial.
0

Mr. Smith, you cite in your brief our decision

last year of Bordankireher against Hayes, and this case
Stic ike s me as not too much different from the Haw Jersey
legislature simply enacting into law what the prosecutor
actually did in Rordenkireher,
MR. SMITH;

I think there is a clear distinction to

be made between this case and Bordenk j.rcher. Bordenklrcher
was dealing with the practice of plea bargaining, and this
Court held that a defendant who engages in plea bargaining and
turns down a plea bargain is not penalised for asserting his
rights.

In Mew Jersey a defendant who refuses to enter a non

TO.lt plea in a murder case but instead goes to trial is
penalised for asserting his rights.
O

Has not the Mew Jersey legislature just

specified -'die terras cf the plea bargain in effect?
MR. SMITH:

The Hew Jersey legislature has indicated

that people who are willing to waive their constitutional
rights may foe sentenced to almost terra from probation up to
life imprisonment.
G

That is what the prosecutor did in Bordenkircher,

was it not?
MR, SMITH:

In Bordenkircher 1 think the answer to

that is simply that the prosecutor could have proceeded on an

7
habitual offender indictment at the very beginning.

Sof the

defendant was eligible for a sentence of life imprisonment on
the date that he was first indicted, as it were.

He paid no

penalty because ha ultimately was sentenced to life imprison­
ment.

Mr. Corbitt, of course, could have received a much

leaser sentence had ha pled non vult.

And because he was

denied these sentencing alternatives when he was convicted at
trial, he did pay a penalty for exercising his rights
Q

On the other hand, he pleaded not guilty.

MR. SMITH:
Q

And he could have been found not guilty.

MR. SMITHS
Q

That is true, Your Honor.

That is very true.

And after having pleaded non vult, he could not

possibly have been found not guilty, is that not correct?
MR. SMITH:

That is very true.

But I do not think

that that factor distinguishes this case from United States
v. Jackson, on which I rely.

Jackson of course was the appeal

of a pretrial motion to dismiss which was branded.

In that

case Mr. Jackson could have been acquitted and, for that matter,
he could have been found guilty of kidnapping? but the jury
could have recommended a sentence of life imprisonment.
Q

But in the Jackson ease the defendant could

have pleaded not guilty and have waived a jury trial, and the
judge under the then federal statute could not possibly have
imposed the death sentence.

8
MR. SMITH;
0

Only the jury could do it.

MR. SMITH:
Q

And this case is different only in that—*

Here he cannot waive a jury trial.

MR. SMITH:
trials.

That is true.

Ml trials and murder cases must be jury

But the fact is that in Jackson this Court held that

the risk of the death penalty was an unnecessary burden upon
the exercise of the right to jury trial, and in this case we
submit that it is the risk of this mandatory life sentence
which is

also an unnecessary burden upon the same right.
0

Of course Jackson involved the death sentence,

which was emphasized by your state suprema court.
MR. SMITH:

That is true.

I was just getting to that.

The state of course claims that Jackson is limited solely to
death penalty cases.

And I think that this contention is at

odds with a long line of cases which have come from this Court,
holding that no significant burden may be placed upon the
exercise of constitutional right.

This Court’s analysis

has

never been limited solely to death penalty cases or even to
cases involving long terms of imprisonment.

Rather, it has

been held that any sanction which makes assertion of a right
costly is forbidden.
For example, in Garritv v. Mew Jersey it was held that
a stata trooper could not be penalized through loss of his
employment because he had asserted his Fifth Amendment rights.

9
In Harman

ffog3sen±us it was held that the filing of a

certificate of registration in lieu of a poll tax was an
impermissible burden upon the right to vote in state elections.
Q

But there ms certainly a burden in Bordenkirchar

too, was there not, as a result of the prosecutor's action?
MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I think we have to face the

fact that people v?ho plead guilty, whether or not there are
plea bargains, come to receive lesser sentences or fines.
However, those people do so freely and knowledgeably.

If they

refuse to enter that plea of guilty, they pay no penalty for
doing so because when they are sentenced, they are. still
eligible for any sentence within the statutory range.
Of course in New Jersey a defendant who refuses to
enter this non vult plea must receive the maximum.

So, his

constitutional right is being directly—
Q

But in Bordenkircher the man was originally

charged with something that was not as great as lie was finally
charged with after he refused the plea bargain.
MR. SMITH:

I think that the opinion in that case

noted rather clearly that the prosecutor could have begun from
the very first day on an habitual offender indictment.
man fit all the criteria for that indictment.

The

It was just done

in sort of the reverse of the normal plea bargaining process,
which is that the prosecutor indicts on a crime and then deals
down.

But in Nmr Jersey your client could t from the

very first day, have elected his jury trial and refused to
plea non vulfc, and he did,
MR, SMITE5

And that is exactly what he did,

doing that he paid this penalty.

And for

He was not eligible for this

lesser term in the state prison even though the judge who
sentenced him might have felt that this sort of sentence was
completely warranted.
In any event, as I have said, I have mentioned the
loss of employment in Garrity ?. Now Jersey and the finding—
0

Exit if a man charged with first degree murder

sticks to a not-guilty plea, he will be tried by jury.
MR. SMITH:
Q

That is true.

And his lawyer and the prosecutor are talking and

it becomes clear that the prosecutor would end up recommending
20 years if he pled guilty.
MR, SMITH:
Q

That is always a possibility.

Why is that not just tine same incentive to

disregard his jury right or the same burden on it?
MR. SMITHs

It certainly is an incentive to disregard

his jury right,
Q

It is the Same burden in the sense that he has

to make up his mind about which alternative or which horn to
jump on.
MR. SMITE:

I think that a distinction has to be made

11
between offering a defendant incentives to give up bis consti­
tutional rights and penalising him if he does not give up those
rights„

A defendant who—Q

Maybe the prosecutor says, "I will never

recommend 20 years if you—obviously under this law I will
never recommend 20 years if you go to trial.

That is your1

penalty."
MR. SMITE:

Of course, he must receive a life

sentence if he is convicted upon the jury trial.
I have discussed these sanctions, the loss of
employment and the filing of a certificate in lieu of poll tax,
and these are relatively minor sanctions.

Yet I think it is

clear that they are the type of sanctions which deter
exercise of constitutional right.
murder statute has the same affect.

I think that this Hew Jersey
A defendant in a first

degree murder case is not going to want to exercise his way to
a jury trial and face the possibility of a aiandatcry life
sentence whan ha can plead non vulf, admit the crime, and still
foe: eligible for a few years in the state prison or, for that
matter, even a term of probation.

The state of course claims

that there is a need for this kind of sentencing provision in
that it promotes plea bargaining.
Q

It also structures the limits and «structures the

bargain.
MR. SMITH:

Of course that could be done through any

12
number of other means#
Q

I grant you* but it does that anyway.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, it does.

Our office is not in any

way opposed to plea bargaining, nor do we wish to restrict
the practice in any manner.
Q

You would not want to do away with it, would

you?
MR. SMITHs

Certainly not.

It is simply our position

that plea bargaining is in no way involved in this case.

This

statute is not analogous to plea bargaining and it certainly is
not necessary to plea bargaining.
a very unique statute.

In fact, this appears* to be

I have not been able to find any other

criminal statute in the United Statos which contains separate
ranges of penalties fox a defendant who la convicted upon a
jury trial and a defendant who is convicted on a guilty plea.
In fact, this is the only New Jersey statute which
has separate penalty ranges.
t

Q

Do not prosecutors make that kind of offer

every day of the week?
MR. SMITH :
Q

Cartainly.

What is the difference

if a prosecutor makes it

or if the legislature makes it?
MR. SMITHs
for the same offense.

As I said before, we have two penalties
A person who plea bargains-*"say starts

out with an armed robbery case and pleads to robbery by fear

13
certainly cannot be compared to the person who goes to trial
and is convicted of armed robbery.

I am just comparing

Mr. Corbitt's situation, having been convicted of felony
murder after a jury trial, with the position of people who
plead non vu.lt to the crime, admit the crime, and are still
eligible for a much lesser sentence.
Q

But they gave up the right to be found not

guilty by a jury.
MR. SMITH:

That is true, and Mr. Corbitt insisted

upon his rights, and for that he received a mandatory penalty.
Q

Mr. Smith, what happens in Hew Jersey if two-»

thirds of the way through the trial before a jury he decides
to plead guilty?
MR. SMITH s

If he decides to plead non vult in the

middle of a trial, he is still eligible for either a sentence
of life imprisonment or a sentence of up to 30 years in the
state prison.
Q

Does that help or hurt your argument?

MR. SMITH:

I suppose it would help my argument

because 1 cannot see any distinction between a person who
admits his guilt halfway through & trial and a person who in
fact insists upon his rights all the way and is convicted
after the—
Q

Is not part of your argument that once he goes

into it hs is irrevocably stuck with it?

So, you do not need

14
that point.
MR. SMITH %

That does not happen to be the practice

in New Jersey.
In any event, as I said, this is the only Nav; Jersey
statute which has separate penalty ranges.

Yet we know that

plea bargaining works in New Jersey in all other statutes.

It

works in robbery cases, kidnapping cases? it works for any
other crime that one could mention.

There is no reason to

believe that this sort of unique sentencing chema therefore is
necessary in any way to conduct plea bargaining.

Rather, it

is unnecessary, as this Court said in United States v. Jackson,
unnecessary and therefore excessive.
As I have indicated previously, this statuta is not
analogous to the process of plea bargaining.

First of all, as

I have said before, it is not a voluntary process.

And,

secondly, it does not contain the mutuality of advantage which
is commonly found in plea bargaining.
The defendant's aim in a plea bargaining is always to
reduce his maximum possible exposure on a crime, and there is
of course any number of ways that this could be done.

But a

defendant who pleads non vult in New Jersey doe3 not limit his
maximum possible exposure, for he is still eligible for the life
sentence.

The only thing that defendant achieves by pleading

non vult is that he insulates himself from the possibility of
the mandatory life sentence, which comes upon a jury conviction.

15
Therefore, we won Id submit

that this raurdrer statute

is nothing more than a unilateral penalty- imposed upon those
persona who have exercised their rights.

I recognize that a

defendant in a criminal proceeding is oftentimes called upon to
make difficult choices.

But the threshold question has always

been, Does compelling an election between two alternatives
impair to any appreciable extent the underlying right involved?
And 1 think that X have demonstrated that this New Jersey
murder statute does in fact deter defendants from exercising
their constitutional rights.
In a number of cases this Court has had the oppor­
tunity to consider the concept of vindictiveness.

It has been

held that a defendant may not be vindictively penalized for
exercising a right, and we submit that this is exactly what, the
New Jersey murder statute does.

It requires that a defendant

who insists upon his rights must receive the maximum sentence.
This is no different than a judge that would announce that it
is his policy to impose a maximum sentence on any defendant who
dares come before him in a jury trial and is convicted.
Thus, as I have indicated, in the final analysis
this statute unnecessarily deters the right to jury trial by
penalizing those defendants who insist upon their rights.
If I may move on to my Equal Protection argument,
as X have indicated before, there are two scales of punishment
Murder in New Jersey.

This classification is

16
not based in any way on the personal or penal status of the
offender but rather solely upon whether ha has exercised his
right to a jury trial.

It does not matter whether the

defendant is a young man or an old man or whether he has no
prior convictions or is an habitual offender.

Rather, the

first decision that a sentencing judge must make in this sort
of case is whether the defendant has exercised his right to a
trial.

If the defendant has been convicted upon a non uulfc

plea,, then the judge of course has complete discretion to
impose almost any sentence between probation and life imprison-*
menfc.

If the defendant has been convicted on a jury verdict,

then the judge has no discretion.

He must impose the maximum

sentence, even if he feels a lesser sentence is warranted.
Q

Would the New vTersey system be constitutionally

acceptable, in your view, if the statute did not require that
all not guilty pleas be tried through a jury but simply
required that if there was to be a waiver of a jury, it had to
be by both sides? In other words, both the defendant and the
prosecution would have to waive the jury.
MR. SMITH*

If X understand Your Honor’s question

correctly, I would think that there would still be a defect in
that in that even if a defendant waived the jury, that he would
still be eligible for a wide range of sentences upon a non vult
plea while he would still have to receive the maximum penalty
upon a. conviction, whether it would foe a judge conviction or a

17
jury conviction.

I have no objection to the concept of

extending leniency towards those parsons who admit their guilt.
But this provides no justification whatsoever for imposing the
maximum sentence on a defendant simply because he has exercised
his rights to a jury trial.

It may be that in certain cases a

judge, as a matter of his own discretion, will feel that a
defendant who has admitted his guilt is more amenable to
rehabilitation.

But it does not logically follow that the

defendant who has insisted upon his constitutional rights must
foe so incorrigible that only the maximum sentence would be
appropriate,
In this case we are simply asking that the defendant,
having insisted upon his right to a jury trial, be eligible
for the same range of penalties that he would have been had he
admitted his guilt through a non yult plea.
Q

If he pleads not guilty to a charge, an indict­

ment, of first degree murder, he can be found not guilty.

He

can be found guilty of some lesser included offense of homicide,
can he not?
MR. SKITHs

Not in this particular casa.

X have used

the felony murder example in my brief because this was a felony
murder >case.

Q

This was an arson, was it not?

MR. SMITH:

Right.

The jury was not charged here

with either a second degree murder or manslaughter.

If

18
Mr. Corbitt was convicted, it would have had to have bean for
a felony murder „
Q

Which is first degree murder in New Jersey»

MR. SMITH:

Correct.

If he would have pled non vult»

he also would have had to admit a felony murder.
Q

But he would not have been admitting a felony

murder; ha would have been admitting murder.
MR, SMITH;

He would have said* 55Your Honor, I

to I not correct as a matter of technical New

Jersey law—I just want to be sure I understand your law—that
whan you plead non vult, it is not to a degree of homicide,
it is just to murder? is that right?
MR. SMITH;
Q

Generalized murder.

MR. SMITH:
Q

That is correct.

Although—

Is that correct?

MR. SMITH;

That is correct, although murder encom­

passes both first degree murder and second degree.
Q

Yes, but you are not pleading non vulfc to felony

murder or to first, degree murder,
MR. SMITHS

No, you are pleading non vnlt to murder,

and you are admitting a felony murder or—
Q

But the jury found him guilty of felony murder.

MR. SMITH;

That is correct.

Q

Had he pleaded non vult, it would not have been

to felony murder? correct?
MR. SMITH:
Q

No, it would have been to—

Murder.

MR. SMITH:

—an unspecified degree of murder.

But,

as X have indicated before, ha obviously in setting forth a
factual basia for his plea he would have had to admit, having
committed a felony murder.
0

Would you think it unconstitutional for a state

to require, as X think some do, every defendant in a murder
case to go to ferial?
MR. SMITH:

No, I do not think there would be any­

thing unconstitutional about that.

I do not think it would be

a wise legislative policy.
Q

Even if it is accompanied by certain mandatory

penalties—in other words, eliminating all possibility of plea
negotiations?
MR. SMITH?

Like I said,- as long as -the same range

of penalties is available, I do not see any problem with it.
I certainly think that that would be an unwise legislative
policy.

Of course that is for the states to decide.
As I have said before, simply because Mr. Corbitt here

has exercised his right to a jury trial, he was not eligible for
a number of valuable sentencing alternatives, which of course is
a sentence up to 30 years in the state prison.

Therefore, the

20
defendant would submit that he was denied Ms right to equal
protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Mr. Chief Justice, if I my{ I would like to reserve
five minutes for rebuttal.
Q

If you are relying on Jackson f on® very clear

difference is that in Jackson , if a defendant pleaded either
guilty of kidnapping with ham to the victim interstate, or if
he pleaded not guilty to the same offense and waived a jury
trial, he absolutely could not have been sentenced to death»
Here, if he pleads non yult, he can be sentenced to life
imprisonment, the earns maximum sentones that a jury can

impose.
MR. SMITHS

That is true.

I should note, however,

that a life sentence upon a jury conviction is not necessarily
the same as a life sentence upon a non yult plea in that the
life sentence upon a jury conviction of course is mandatory
and it must be to the state prison.

A life sentence upon a

non vult plea is purely discretionary, and it may be~~
Q

1 know.

But the sentencing judge may impose it

and may send him to the state prison.
MR. SMITH:
Q

That is true.

That makes

this

different from the Jacks or?.

case where there was absolutely no power in the absence of a
jury recommendation under the statute to impose the sentence
that a jury could have recommended.

21
MR. SMITH:
Your Honor»

That is certainly a factual distinction,

I would submit, however, that the real question

that must be decided in a case like this is, De>£?s the statutory
scheme serve to deter exercise of the constitutional right?
fed X think that this clearly deters defendants from exercising
the right to a jury trial.

Therefore, I would submit it is

unconstitutional just as the Federal Kidnapping Act.
0

Mr. Smith, x gather that New Jersey still uses

in the murder indictment the old common law form, just
"wilfully, feloniously,
forth.,

and of malice of forethought” and so

It says nothing whatever in the indictment itself that

it is a felony.
MR. SMITH:
Q

That is correct.

And that is why, going back to your answer to

my Brother Stewart, that is why you say when he pleads, he does
not plead to felony murder.

He pleads to that common law

indictment, does he not?
MR. SMITH:
Q

That is correct.

fed then the fact that it was a felony murder

simply comes out in his admission as to the conduct which
constituted the offense.
MR. SMITH:

Right.

Whan he sets forth a factual

basis fox* a plea, he would have to admit it.

In this case -the jury found your client guilty

Well, that is interesting.

Under New Jersey law they are required

to specify either first degree murder or second degree murder.
They did not do that.
case.

But of course this was a felony murder

There was no instruction given on second degree murder.

And the assumption of course always was made that he had to
receive the mandatory life sentence.
Q

Can you make assumptions in criminal cases

when the jury has not found him guilty?
MR. SMITH:

The situation there was, when I first

got this case after it had been accepted by the Mew Jersey
Supreme Court, I attempted to raise that same argument.

But

they had granted certification limited to the question of the
constitutionality of this statute, and they did not choose
to hear me on that argument.
Q

So, by hypothesis in this case he was found

guilty of felony murder.
MR. SMITHt

That is correct.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. DaCicco.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN DeCl'CCO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. DaCICCO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented by this case is whether the
New Jersey statutory sentencing scheme for murder impermissibly

23
infringes upon a defendant's
to trial.

Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights

A subsidiary question is whether the statutory

scheme at issue deprives an accused of equal protection of the
laws.
It is our position that New Jersey's homicide statutes
do not in any way burden those wishing to exercise their Fifth
and

Sixth Amendment rights to defend against murder charges

before a jury, nor do our statutes deprive those individuals
of equal protection of the laws.
At the outset we recognize and emphasise that if the
sole objective and result of state legislation is to
unnecessarily discourage the assertion of constitutional
rights, then the statutory scheme is patently unconstitutional.
However, this case involves nothing more than a statutory
codification of plea bargaining in homicide cases and nothing
else.

Even assuming any form of on inducement, this Court has

held that there is no chilling effect on the exercise of
constitutional rights when three criteria have been met.

One,

the statutory scheme serves a necessary and legitimate state
interest and/or interest to a defendant, which is present here.
Q

is?

Would you explain to me what that state interest

Is it anything other the same interest you have in a

plea bargain of course in persuading the defendant not to
stand trial?
HR. DeCICCO:

The interest is to conserve scarce

24
judicial and prosecutorial resources.

Secondly,, the interest

is to facilitate the correctional process with respect to the
specific offender.
Q

Tha interest runs both ways.

Those are always present when you persuade a

defendant not to stand trial.
MR. DeCICCO:
Q

That is correct.

So, then is it not still true that the sole

thing that this tends to accompliah is to persuade him not to
stand trial?

And there are byproducts of that if it works out.

MR. DeCICCO:
accomplishment.
imprisonment.
Q

I wotild not characterize it as a sole

It allows him to avoid the rigors of life
It allows the defendant to realise—
This statute allows him to avoid that?

MR. DeCICCO:

Yes, it does.

The non vult provision

does.
Q

He cannot avoid that if he elects to exercise

his constitutional right.
MR. DaCXCCO:

Yes, he might even avoid it there,

should he be acquitted or should he be convicted of a lesser
degree of homicide.
Secondly, if the statutory goals are unobtainable
through any other means, then this Court has upheld statutory
schemas such as the. present.

Q

Excuse me again,. Mr. DeCicco.

You say the

Court has upheld statutory schemes such as this?
MR, DeCICCO:

It has upheld statutory and/or common

law schemes whereby the goals are unattainable through any
other—
Q

Has it ever upheld a statutory scheme in which

the range of penalties for one who stands trial is more severe
than the range of penalties for one who pleads guilty.?.
MR. DeCICCO:

Not a statutory scheme, but int

Bo rdenk1rchar~Q

So, it has not upheld a statutory scheme.

MR. DeCICCO:

No; excuse me, sir.

In Bordenkircher

it upheld the prosecutorial plea negotiation system whereby
the same result was obtained.
In striking the balance with relation to these three
components of our equation, it is submitted that the New Jersey
homicide statutes are beyond constitutional attack.

Indeed,

appellant has failed to demonstrate any measurable incidence
of defendants who have been needlessly chilled in their exercise
of their Fifth and/or Sixth Amendment rights to trial.
Initially, in considering the extent of any chilling
effect purportedly exerted on our homicide statutes, reference
to United States v, Jackson, is helpful.

There of course a

defendant who proceeded to jury trial would be subject to the
death penalty, while a defendant who chose any other means of

26
either admitting his guilt or going to trial would be eligible
for something less than the death penalty.
Q

It is stronger than that.

'The death penalty

could not be imposed on any such defendant, could not legally
have been imposed upon him.
MR. DeCICCO:

Q

Yes.

Not that he was eligible for something less.

MR. DeCICCO:

In Jackson the maximum permitted was

greater, should he choose to go to trial, than the maximum
under the New Jersey statutory scheme.

We think that is

significant.
Q

imprisonment.

In the other case you must get life

You have the same maximum.

But are you suggesting

there is no material difference between those choices because
the maximum is the same?
MR. DeCICCO:

Generally speaking, I would say there

is no material difference when you are speaking of disparate
minimum sentences because that is in essence what all plea
bargaining is about.

The defendant who chooses not to go to

trial generally—not always—-generally will receive a lesser
term of incarceration, i.e., a lesser minimum, whereas a
defendant who goes to trial may receive a greater term of
incarceration.

27
Q

That is true of plea bargaining generally, bat

I do not see ho7.-? that supports your notion that as long as the
maxima are the same in both alternatives there Is no significant
disparity.

I take it that is your distinction of Jackson«
MR. DeCICCOs

Jackson, yes.

That is one of our distinctions of

I would also note that we are dealing here with

two different forms of conviction.

A conviction for non vnlt

murder is to a general short form murder indictment in New
Jersey,

it is unspecified as to vhafc in fact the defendant has

in fact pled guilty to other than the general category of
murder; whereas having been tried for first degree murder and
having been convicted, there is a specific designation which
the legislature has determined should be penalised by a manda­
tory terra of life imprisonment.
The distinction that we would like to first draw with
Jackson is the fact that the death penalty is not present
here, "whereas it was there.

In fact, it was a greater maximum

than under the Mew Jersey statutory scheme.

This Court has

recognised even in Jackson—and most recently in Lockit y. Ohio-that the death penalty is qualitatively different from mere
imprisonment„
Q

Mr, DeCicco, if you rely on the death penalty

-

as the distinguishing feature, are you suggesting that it would
be impermissible for a prosecutor who had obtained an indictment
for a capital offense to offer as an inducement to a plea of

28
guilty that he would withdraw the capital charge and substitute
a lesser charge?

In other words, is it permissible plea

bargaining to offer to dismiss a capital charge?
MR. DeCICCO:
0

Yes, I think it would be.

If it is permissible, then how does that

distinguish the Jackson case?
DeCICCO:

Because I think that in Jackson and

in death generally, whenever we are talking about that, we are
talking about the extent of the encouragement„

I believe this

Court in Jackson used the phrase '’needless encouragement."

And

what we are trying to do here at this point of the argument is
to demonstrate that doing away with trie potential for death
does away greatly»—if not in fact altogether*—with the extent
of any unnecessary inducement, any chilling effect.
Secondly, and as I have already mentioned, more
significantly, is the fact that a defendant in New Jersey is
subject to the same maximum sentence, life imprisonment,
regardless of whether he chooses to go to trial or to plead
non vult.

The maximum in Jackson was greater? since: death was

only available, trial rights ware asserted.
The argument that has been raised that disparate
minimum sentences induce the defendant to forego his Fifth
Amendment rights does not take into account our plea bargaining
practice in general.

And in this case specifically the fact

that the defendant who does proceed to trial faces various

29
alternatives between conviction

of first degree murder#

conviction of second degree murder# convictam of manslaughter,
or acquittal.

The defendant who pleads non vult also has

various alternatives confronting him from a term of life
imprisonment to anything loss.

Q

Did this particular defendant face any alterna­

tives other than those of acquittal or conviction of felony
murder?
MR. DeCICCG:

In this particular case# it was tried

to the jury on a felony murder theory»

There were no other

instructions.
I would not, in all honesty# assume any jury
nullification in this case.

Either he was going to be convicted

or he was going to be acquitted.
Q

And convicted of an offense for which the-*-'

MR. BeCxCCO;

I think the statute would be somewhat

different from this.
Q

In what respect?

are talking about a driving offenso for which, if he pleiads

Q

Suppose it says the fine shall be up to $5,000

then, from $10 to $5,000, at the judge's discretion? bat if
he stands trial, it is $5,000.
MR. DeCICCO:
Q

We have the same maximum?

Yes»

MR. DaCICCO:

It would be in essence the seme case

as this.
Q

You say that is perfectly okay?

MR. BeCICCO:
Q

Yes.

It would be different though if the maximum was

30 days in jail instead of $5,000.
MR. DeCICCO:

Yes, that is Jackson.

If the maximum

is greater, then—
Q

No, the maximum in both cases? it is from a $10

fine to a maximum of 30 days in jail, and a $10 fine to $5,000

31
MR. DaCICCO:
Q

I misunderstood.

And in the other case, the 30-day jail is

automatically imposed if he elects to stand trial.
MR. DeClCCO;

Q

That is correct.

And you say—

MR. BeCICCOs

It would be the same case»

I misunder­

stood your—*
Q

It would be the same case as this?

MS. DaCXCCG:
Q

Yes.

And you say that statute would be all right?

MR. DeCICCOs

Yes.

There may come a time whan the

statutory scheme is so disparate between the—let us say in your
example, if it were a ten-day or a ten-year prison term,
depending upon the choice, in that situation, as in Jackson
where you have the death penalty versus a mere term of years,
perhaps you would find a needless encouragement.

The extent

of the encouragement would be so great as to make the scheme
constitutionally defective.
Q

Sven if the maxima are the same?

MR. DeClCCOs

It is possible even if the maxima are

the same, if there were a great disparity.

Q

As soon as you admit that, how do you get out of

the boss in this case, then?

What is the difference in range of

penalties that may be imposed here?
MR. BeCICCOs

We are dealing hare between life

imprisonment * which has already been indicated, the first—
Q

And what would have been the minimum if he had

taken a plea?
MR. DeCICCO:

The minimum could be zero.

But he

could gat—

Q

That is quite a difference in range.

MR. DeCICCOs
Q

He could gat up to 30 years.

Is that greater or lesser than the difference

I gave to you of $100 to 30 days in jail?
MR. DeCICCO?

It is lesser because in practical

terras a murder defendant pleading guilty will not receive a
non-custodial term or a fine merely? rather, generally we are
bargaining then at that point in time for terras of years, i.e
25 to 30 or whatever the case may be.

questions, however, if he stands trial, he

case, but again he did not face the same*—he faced a greater

Timbers, found the whole statute unconstitiational in the

Or ware we dealing with somebody who had been

MR. DeCICCOs
Q

In Jackson?

Yes, in Jackson.

MR. DeCICCOs

We were dealing with someone who was

convicted by a jury.
Q

I thought there had been a motion to dismiss

the indictment and that the district

judge had found the whole

statute unconstitutional.
MR. DeCICCO:

He had been convicted by a jury, and

this Court vitiated the death penalty in that case.
Q

The district court had held the entire statute

unconstitutional in Jackson.
MR. DeCICCOs

And this Court knocked the penalty out,

yes.
In any event, I think it should foe made clear that
this Court has held on various occasions that the Constitution
does not forbid every governmental imposed choice in the

34
criminal process that may have the potential of discouraging
the exercise of constitutional rights»

While to this point we

have emphasised that the quantum of the encouragement to plead
non valfc to avoid the potential of life imprisonment is
miniscule, we would also want to emphasise the legitimate
benefits which are attributable to the New Jersey statutory
scheme.
This Court—and again I reiterate the plea bargaining
theme because I think it is so very significant in the dis­
position of this case—this Court has previously recognized
the vitality of the concept of plea bargaining as a necessary
component to the criminal justice system.

In most plea

bargaining situations the defendant must determine whether to
exercise his right to plead innocent and to receive a possibly
or, in all probability, higher sentence or whether' to forego
his right to contest his guilt and to receive in all probability
a lesser sentence.

Thus, plea bargaining has always had as an

assertion of his trial rights.
imposition

This Court has held that the

of this difficult choice is an inevitable

attribute of the plea bargaining system.

And in this regard,

our statutory system does not in any way deviate from plea
bargaining in general.
•The benefits of the non vu.lt statutory scheme in
New Jersey are several»

The benefits the defendant involved

35
by permitting him to avoid the expense and hardship of a trial.
It assures the prompt commencement of the correctional process.
Statutory plea'bargaining affords the defendant the possibility
of ameliorating the rigors of life imprisonment, which is
perhaps the most important benefit attributable to the' present,
scheme.
Q

And, incidentally, I gather if he got life after

a plea, his eligibility for parole is no different than if he
got a mandatory life sentence after a jury—
MR. DeClCCO:

There is absolutely no distinction

between the two.
It must also be emphasised that plea bargaining is
predicated upon the concept that those who acknowledge their
guilt are in a better position and. are in a better process
fox* rehabilitation and should be given consideration on that
account.
Prom the state’s viewpoint, our statutory scheme for
murder conserves scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources.
It also must be recognized that the state’s interests are
served by our scheme in that the legislature has determined
that a conviction for the specific crime of first degree
murder should carry a mandatory term of life imprisonment.

In

essence, the statutory scheme is a bilateral scheme rather them
a unilateral scheme as has been advanced here today.
Q

Are they not both convictions?

36

MR. DeCICCO:
Q

I thought you said that they were different.

MR. DeCICCO:

Yes,- they are.

They are.

MR. DeCICCOs

Would

he give the same time for first degree murder as manslaughter?
£SR. DeCICCO:

That is what I thought.

MR. DeCICCO:

Yes,

But again we must also take

into consideration—
Q

And would net that be the same if the man just

came in and said, "I want a trial before a judge without a

Would the judge do the same thing?

He cannot have a trial without a jury.

would not the judge determino it?
MR. DeCICCO:

In the other states, yes,

I would like

to emphasize something else, Mr. Justice Marshall—
Q

The part that worries me is the distinction

that you see that I do not see.
MR. DeCICCOs

When the

In New Jersey the factual
judge sees those facts, he

might determine not to accept a plea, based upon—let us say
the prosecutor recommends

25 years and the judge will think

to himself that that just is a little too easy vis-a-vis the
facts of the case.

Q

1 see»

MR. DeCXCCOs

Also significant is the fact that in

New Jersey under our present statutory scheme the benefits of
it are unavailable, are unattainable, by any other means.
Elimination of the mandatory life sentence x-zould nullify the
legislative determination that that is the appropriate penalty
for first degree murder.

Abolition of the non vult plea

would have a detrimental effect on defendants who wished to
acknowledge their guilt and to properly avail themselves of
less harsh treatment by immediately commencing the rehabilita­
tion process.
Thus, in our view, the Net* Jersey statutory scheme
does not place an excessive burden or in fact any burden upon
a defendant's right to plead not guilty.
Moreover, the scheme is justified by necessary and
legitimate state needs.
We recognize that no man. should receive an additional

39
penalty because he defends against a charge»

But it does not

follow that one who acknowledges his guilt should not be
given consideration on that account.
I will now briefly turn to the Equal Protection
argument raised in this case.

It is our view that the Equal

Protection arguroent— the issue as to Equal Protection does
not exist in this case.

If there is an unconstitutional

compulsion placed upon a defendant's Fifth and/or Sixth
Amendment rights , this case would of course be disposed of
on Jackson grounds*

If there is no constitutional impediment;,

then it follows that, the Equal Protection argument would
equally be maritless.,

We submit that the category in New

Jersey at the time of the decision whether to proceed to trial
or to plead non vult the category is the same.
category; that is, indicted murders.
identical choices.

You have one

And they all have the

So, therefore, there is no Equal Protection

argument at that point in time*
If the appellant argues that the classes do not come
into existence subsequent to conviction, which I believe the
appellant doss argue, that also must fall because at that point
we have two classes.

Wa do not have one but two classes, and

they are those people who have been convicted of murder and
those people who have been convicted of first degree murder
for which the legislature has determined a life imprisonment
penalty.

And so that under either alternative or theory the

40
Equal Protection argument would be non-existent.
Lastly, even assuming a cognisable class for
purposes of the Equal Protection argument, in our view the
argument must fall.

We have in New Jersey a legitimate and

indeed compelling state interest in fostering the statutory
scheme ’which we have mentioned here today.

These are, to

repeat, amelioration of the rigors of life .imprisonment,
recognition of the rehabilitative prospects by one willing to
admit his guilt, the ability to avoid trial, facilitation of
plea negotiations, the conservation of scarce judicial and
prosecutorial resources, and prompt punishment of offenders.
Suffice it to say the benefits accrued by defendants
in the state demonstrate that the Equal Protection argument
is meritlees.

Thank you for your attention to our argument.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. SMITH, UR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, SMITH:

Your Honor, I would like to make just on©

quick point, that being that a defendant in Nev? Jersey of
course cannot plead to the offense of first degree murder.
Pleas are not accepted to either first degree or second degreemurder.

The state before the New Jersey Supreme Court made

the same argument that basically there was a difference

41
between a conviction for first degree murder and a conviction
for murder*

The New Jersey Suprema Court held--and I am reading

from page 33 of the Appendix—that "We do not accept the
position as a fully satisfactory basis for meeting the
defendant's argument, which, it seems to us, can and should be
dealt with more directly."
X think, therefore, that the opinion of the New
Jersey Supreme Court does not revolve on this matter of
statutory construction, but it was decided upon the const!tutionai principles upon the assumption that a parson who
pleads non vult to murder and admits a felony murder is in
fact in the same position as a person who is convicted of a
felny murder.

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
