MR. CHIEF ,TITSTICE BURr:ER:

S

We will hear arquments

next in No. 1119, Orr against Orr.
Hr. Capell, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL AR<ruMENT OF JOHN L. CAPELL, III, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELIJ;NT
HR. CAPELL:

Mr. Chief JURtice, and may it please

the Court:
William Orr has been required to pay alimony to his
former wife under Alabama statutes, whict require payment of
alimony by husbandR only,

An<'I so the quEstion hefore you

today is whether or not these

statutes violate the Equal

Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 1\mendrnent of our United
States Constitution.
This Court's precedent eRtablishes that laws
classifying on the basis of sex are unconstitutional when
routed in the role tyning once routinely imposed on women and
men.

Two, uh n that notion that women are men's subordinates.

And, three, overbroad qross r ankinq of men as domina.,t and
independent, women as weak, inferior, and dependent.

l\!l

appellee puts .l.t, the law deriven from a view of the married
wo:man as a non-entity, a view maintained for centuries but now
recognized as archaic, outmoded, and holy inconsistent with
the equal status anft d iqni ty of all persons under ou:::-

4

Alabama's schema, routed as it is in historic role
typing, cannot be justified as remedial.

Any attempt to dress

the classification in a compensatory cloak is inevitably
deceivable.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURr.ER:

Would you say there is

something in the nature of role casting, stereotyping, in
Rahn against Shevin?
MR. CAPELL:
l!lO!llent.

Rahn v. Shevin, sir, I am going to in a

Rahn v. Shevin, your Court came out and said that it

was all right in that instance hccause we were dealing with a
tax situation and, as pointed out in that case, the etates
given great leeway in Kahn v. Shovin,
Alabama

under the

Your Honor, the situation is on a case by

case method.

Read in context with

alimony statute,

its common law origin, the Alahama law was hardly designed
with economic preference for worn n in minj, as was Kahn.
On the contrary, as the

brief pointed

out, the common law suhordinatcd the wife to the husband.

It

declared the wife disal:>led, stripped her of her capacity to
sustcin herself.
Q

This particular provision

Alabama's law was

cert inly desiqned to prefer worn n, was i; not?

MF-. CAPELL:

lt was de iqned to prefer

bacause there is no statute which

No, the real reason is that the court ordered

your client to pay alimony.
MR. CAPELL:

Based on an AlabaJr.a statute.

But there would not have been an order to pay

alimony unless the oourt, under the circumstances of this case,
thought that such an order was appropriate.
MR. CAPELL:

Without this statute, sir, alimony

proceedings?

MR. CAPELL:

He would have had-Did he?
No, sir.

No, sir, he did not,

Honor.
Q

He did not protest this alimony?

MR. CAPELL:

He Hls no.: allowed to, Your Honor, at

that time becausn the otatute did not all::iw him to even
request alirno y.

O

But he <lid not.

MR. CAPELL:

No, sir.

lie did not file

a

piece of paper saying that,

did he?

·-

MR. CAPELL:

No, sir, he did not.

6

Q

The question on my mind--perhaps you can

satisfy it, it did not seem to bother the court of your state-is, Why is this a case or controversy if your client did not
ask for alimony?
MR. CAPELL:

The appellate courts of Alabama said

that the appeal was timely filed when we questioned the
judgments that were tryinq to be obtained by the appellee wife
against Mr. Orr.

And at that point in time he questioned

whether or not this would be a valid judgment base, because
of the constitutional issue which we are presenting before you
today.
Q

But your claim is that, as I understand it,

that this law of your state is unconRtitutional because it
authorizes a court to award alimony only to a wife at the
expense of a husband.
MR. CAPELL:

That is right, sir.

It is on a qeneral

line strictly on _sex.
Q

Riqht.

But there could he a law, a perfectly

constitutional law, in your submission that authorized a co•.rrt
to order alimony to either party in a divorce.

In any event,

in this case the court ordered your client to pay alimony.
MR. CAPELL:

That is correcc.

The lower court

ordered--

o

I do not see how this controversy arises W\less

or until there should be a case in which the divorcing husband

7
asked for alimony from the wife, and the court of your state
said, "No.

I would like to qive it.

It should be qiven in

this case.

But I cannot under the statute."

Your case is not

anything approaching that.
MR. CAPELL:

Let us look at it this way, Your Honor.

When a man comes into a court in Alabama in a divorce suit,
the stature of justice is

at that point in time, Your

Honor, to determine what sex he is; and
the point in time when

on an unconstitutional statute, Your Honor.

it when she tried to come in and say,

"You have to pay me these many dollars.•
And he said, "That judqment would be illegal because

it was being based on a statute which

is unconstitutional."

Had there been an alimony stat&te in Alabama which
was sex neuter, where Mr. Orr could have come in and said
"I want alimony," he would have done so.
Q

Is there any--

Yes, Justice Marshall.

MR. CAPELL:

In divorce proceedinqs, Your Honor, in

Alabama there are three parties to every aqreement.

There is

the man , there is the woman, and there is the State of Alabama.
The State of Alabama, as the cases have pointed out, is the
silent party lookinq to see that the women are protected.
This case was cited.

This is what Mr. Orr is contending, that

neuter basis--and he is ready, willing, a1d able to qo back
and to fiqht on the basis of sex neuter hattle, which would be

MR. CAPELL:

--what are we to take from the procedural

you will see that it stater.--and I am quotinq in essence-that any statute which favorR women against men is constitutional.

MR. CAPELL:

And I &m

wondering, in view of our long e&tablishei rule, that one must

state proceeding anrl must

Powell's qucction to you does not suggest that perhaps the

that the re11ult was right hut that it sim·>lY should not have

13

MR. CAPELL:

I would like to rEspectfully state that

that, in my opinion, would not be the reason, Your Honor.

I

would like to maintain before this Court that Mr. Orr does
have standing, based on the facts of the Alabama statutes as
we have specified.
Q
I

I

am not talking about standing, Mr. Capell.

am talking about whether or not the Supreme Court of

Alabama, which is the hiqhest court of Al3bama, in fact did
give a judgment on a constitutional question, which is
properly now before this Court.

Of course that is quite alien to the tradition

happy to brief that point and submit a subsequent brief to

So, does

that mean it was aff irrned?
MR. CAPELL:

are aff inning the statutes of Alabama concerning alimony
statutes, sir.

in perspective with Wiesenfeld and

Goldfar b clarified that the Court follows no reject rule.
Women litigants win and men, males, lose because we know both
in Wiesenfeld and

men were the complainants, men

in both cases, as in the instant case. Gender type-castinq
frozen in leqislation was the tarqet which was succesnfully
attacked.

not enacted to remedy or to reduce ho3tility to women in

19

In SU!lVllation, the qender classification at issue as
a means to

allocate maintenance responsibility post-divorce

is patently unfair and does not relate substantially to the
state objective.

Functional sex-neutral classification is

the fair means readily availahle to request rights and
obligations between spouses because one-way alimony is a
historical hangover that discriminates against men and
stigmatizes women; the decision helow cannot survive reasoned
review.

Ant'!, consequently, we respectfully request that the

Alabama alimony stntute be held unconstitJtional.
Q

Mr. Capell, before you sit down--

MR. CAPELL:

But cannot one arque that both of those cases

MR. CAPELL:

There is an argument that the fE!lllale wage

earner was the victim of the discrimination because she got
less for her Social Security tax.

If you view them that way,

is there any case that is inconsistent with that theory?
MR. CAPELL:

No,

if you cast the case of Orr in a

standpoint of econ0111ic considerations only, where you have a
gender type role casting.

So, my answer would be it would be

a determination of how you look at Goldfarb and how you look
at Wiesenteld.

O

Whether there is discrimination against men

or women.
MR. C'APELL:
Q

If you should pre-1ail here, what happens?

MR. CAPELL:

Yes, sir.

It goes back to Alabama, Your Honor.

Ann then what?

MR. C'l\PELL:

Ann

l\labar.ia will look at this case

or. a sex neuter b11sls, looking at need, not sex, lookinq at
ability to pay, lookinq at from the standing of where both
men and women come into court on an equal basis where there ls
no t i lt, where there iu no favoritism because of sex.
Q

What if your Alabama court says that the result

of this litiqation is that no alimony is ;>ermissible in
Alabruna?
MR. CAPELL:

Two thinqs would

very quickly,

21
Your Honor.

Again it is up to the Alabaira and not this Court,

is my feeling .

But under the common law doctrine that was in

existence prior to the statute, it could take effect.

But

they would have to look at it with your order in mind--that is,
sex neuter, equality under the law regardless of sex.
Q

so that even if you prevail here, you still may

ultimately lose, depending on the facts?
MR. CAPELL:

Yes, sir, depending on what we call

losing and what we cal:. winning, Your Ron:>r, because I feel
that when Mr. Orr came into the lower court, he came in with
not a chance to bargain, to place himself on an equal footing
with Mrs. Orr.
O

we ask for that riqht.

Sex neuter or whatever, you never took the

If he

I do not think that he would any more than Mr. Orr has
standing.
Q

And why not?

MR. HORSLEY:

Because he has not lost anything by it,

since he was not asking for alimony.
Q

I see.

The fact that the statute gives the

judgo to enter a certain kincl of judgment against one class
of persons and against no other does not give a n1ember of that
class standing to attack that statute?

MR. HORSLEY:

It is my understa1ding that to raise

the constitutional issue, you should have suf!ered the
discrimination that you are claiming is i1herent in the
statute.

And if you h;1ve not suffered th! discrimination,

then it is not up to yciu tc raise the con3titutional question.

As I understand this Court's decision since 1971 in
cases involving gender classification statutes, it is the law
that statutes granting an economic preference to women are
constitutional.

This is so because the Court has recognized

that in this country there has been a long history of economic
discrimination against women.

The statutes

designed to

compensate for that discrimination do not violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the Constitution.

Counsel, are the statutes that we have been

questioning, both you and your opponent, on page 3 of the
Jurisdictional Statemcnt--C.o 30-2-51 through 53 deal only
with alimony or do they deal with distribution of property
among the parties too?

Or are there other sections of the

upon the breakup of the marriage?

So, these deal with both?

Alalnuna law was not intended as compensat Lon because he says
that it grows out of 1he husband's col'llllon law obligation of

We say that the husbnnd's c0ll'mo1 law obligation of

support was intended as compensation, and alimony merely
cohtinues that obliqation after r.arriage.

The Alabama

appellate courts have viewed the ohliqation of support as
to the wife of the rights

marriage, such as the right to contract, :he right to own

He did not submit to the jirisdiction of the

MR. HORSLEY:

No, sir, that is true; he did not
