PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 78-610, Columbus Board of
Education v. Penick.
Mr. Porter., you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL H. PORTER3 ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PORTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the application of presumptions
of intention in order to extrapolate a judgment of systemwide liability and the imposition of a system-wide racial
balance remedy from conduct where a system-wide racial
balance remedy is not warranted by the incremental segre­
gated effects of the identified constitutional violations.
I wish to make at the outset a brief statement,
an overview of the Columbus Public School System and the
remedy that the court ordered in this matter before I go
to a discussion of the specific errors.

Initially, I

would like to point out that the Ohio State Board of
Education was a party below and has filed a brie'*’ concur
ring with the petitioners® view, and their position Is fully
supportive of ours and we in turn are supportive of what
they have to say and we recommend that brief to the Court.

The Columbus Public School System is the fourtennth largest city school system in the United States.
And like most school systems, during the fifties and
sixties it went through an enormous period of growth.
In 1950, it had a school enrollment of about 46,000
students.

In grow to 1971 with about 110,000.

At the

same time, its area increased from some 45 square miles
to 170 square miles, one of the largest growths that took
place anywhere in this country,
QUESTION:

Are the boundaries of the school

district coterminous with the boundaries of the city of
Columbus?
MR. PORTER:

Not entirely, Mr. Justice Stewart.

There are some exceptions that took place by virtue of
some legislation in 1958 which made at that time they did
not have to follow each other.

They are for the most

part, however, particularly since the Ohio Supreme Court
In 1956 ordered or approved a transfer of a number of
pieces to the city of Columbus that had been authorized
by the Ohio State Board of Education, so that they are at
this time for the most part contiguous, but not entirely.
During this period of time, the school system
added 103 school buildings and they added 145 additions
to various facilities, some old and some that were built
during that time.

So at the time of trial, the system

5
consisted of 170 school buildings, with 97,000 students,
approximately 67 percent white and approximately 32 per™
cent non-white.
QUESTION:

That adds up to 99 percent.

MR. PORTER:

6?.5 white and 32.5 non-white.

There are very few others.

There are a few but they are

insignificant.
QUESTION:

Well, what are they if they are not

white or non-white?
MR. PORTER:

They are non-white.

In the early

seventies and the late sixties, the Columbus Public School
System set out on a system that was designed to bring about
voluntary integration of its school system, and it entered
into what it refers to and what is described in the court’s
opinion as the Columbus Plan of Racial Transfers.

They

also set about a program of magnet and alternative schools,
a series of career centers that are located throughout the
system, and they attempted to with new attendance areas to
improve racial balance.

All of these things were expanded

each year during the 1970's.

And although there is not

racial balance within the Columbus Public School System,
and was not at the time of trial, all, virtually all schools
were racially mixed and the balance within the schools of
Columbus, their racial balance was superior or a better
balance than that which existed within the residential

6
patterns of the City of Columbus at that time.
All schools at the time of trial had balanced
faculties.

On March 8, 1977, the District Court found

that the entire Columbus Public School System was unlaw­
fully segregated and based on this general conclusion of
system-wide liability, and without determining the incre­
mental segregative effect, ordered a system-wide racial
balance remedy, and they did this in spite of the fact
that they had determined at the same time that it would
not have been possible to have had within the public
school system of Columbus without any act of unconstitu­
tional conduct a racially balanced system, and that is
part of the lower court’s findings.
QUESTION:

Mr. Porter, don’t you think that

the District Court’s findings are pretty well insulated
from review by the language from Judge Edwards’ ooinlon
of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in this case
which is at page 199 of the petition, where he says if
the detailed findings In this paragraph tracking the
language of the Dayton case — and he is referring to the
District Court’s post-Dayton opinion — cannot appropri­
ately be applied from the District Judge's post-Dayton
opinion, and we think they can and should be, we now
enter these findings as the findings of this Court based
upon the 6„600 pages of evidence in the record made before

7
the District Court.
MR. PORTER:

If the question, Mr. Justice

Rehnqulst -- and I am not sure that I understand it — if
the question is is that an appropriate finding of system­
wide liability by the Court of Appeals, it is our oosition
that it is not.

If the question is are we raising at this

time or attacking the findings by the District Court with
respect to specific violations, no, we are not, we are
assuming that those findings were correct.

What our po­

sition is that they were isolated findings and that they
cannot support a system-wide remedy.

And we go further*

and say that the Sixth Circuit, that Judge Edwards cannot
overcome the failure to make specific findings simnly by
making the statement that he does make.

We believe that

he is required under the Dayton case to make specific
findings of fact and then determine the incremental seg­
regative effect.
The order that the District Court, the order
of desegregation which the District Court aporoved ordered
the reassignment of some 42,000 school children.

It

ordered the transportation for racial balance of 37,000.
It required the purchase of some 213 buses, with using
those buses plus the old fleet, it requires four startinp^
times and four ending times during the day.

And this was

done, as I said, even though the court had found that if

8
the Columbus system had never acted improperly, the racial
balance would not be accurately reflected within the system.

The District Court recognised in his March 8,
1977 opinion that racial imbalance was due to the residen­
tial patterns within the City of Columbus.

We believe

that the question that is presented here is where there is
no history of absolute segregation, whether compelled by
statute or otherwise, and the system serves urban areas
with large and highly concentrated black populations, where
there is substantial residential segregation, can you under
those circumstances use standards and presumptions in order
to arrive at a system-wide remedy.
The first and most obvious error was that the
court, the lower courts failed to determine the current
incremental segregative effect in the manner required by
Dayton I,

The second was that the lower courts concluded

that Columbus was a dual system through the improper use
of legal presumptions and shifting burdens of proof.

And,

third, the lower courts applied an erroneous standard for
determining segregative intent.

We believe that Dayton I sets forth the required
approach that federal courts must take in the trial of
school desegregation cases.

The first step Is to make a

factual determination of whether there were specific
instances where the school board

tended to and did in

9
fact discriminate against minorities.

And if such con­

stitutional violations are ascertained, then the court
must determine the current incremental segregative effect
of these violations on the present racial school population.
The incremental effect is to be measured by comparing the
present racial distribution in the schools to what it would
have been if the constitutional violations had not occurred.
QUESTION:

Mr. Porter, I take it your argument

is that this should be done even if there is a supportable
finding of a system-wide violation?
MR. PORTER:

Yes, because, Mr. Justice, because

simply the statement that there Is a finding of system-wide
is meaningless by itself.

It is our position that it is

necessary to make a determination of what was the
of those violations presently,

and what is the incremental

segregative effect and what is necessary in order to elim­
inate It.
QUESTION:

Would you make the sme

argument if

there was a de jure case such as the Swann case?

Are you

asking us to reconsider Swann, in other words?
MR. PORTER:

We believe that Swann and Green

are remedy cases, they are de jure.

We believe in those

cases that you are dealing solely with remedy.

Here the

question Is first violation.
QUESTION:

But my question was assuming that you

10
had a supportable finding of a system-wide violation, that
was my question.
MR. PORTER:

You could very well be required,

the courts could very well be required to make a finding
of effects present effect.

For example, suppose the

system has gone through desegregation, suppose it has gone
through racial balance and it In fact is racially balanced,
such as in Pasadena, and it is raciall balanced, and then
it gets out of balance.

The question becomes whether or

not it is a duty and obligation and so forth, and it would
be our position that before you could you would have to
make the determination.
QUESTION:
differently.

Let me put the question a little

Suppose you have two eases, one a de jure

case and another a de facto case in which there is ad­
mittedly a system-wide violation, and in both cases it
would be rather for the — there had never been any
violation at all, you wouldn't have total integration.
Would you say the remedy authorized in Swann is appropriate
02’ inappropriate?

Or would you say there is a difference

between the two cases?
MR. PORTER:

If I followed it -- and I may have

lost it, 1 beg your pardon — we feel that there is a
difference.

We think you have to make findings.

We

don't think that you can get to a question of whether or

11
not there Is system-wide violation, whether there is de
jure or whether there is tate imposed constitutional
violations throughout the system without making the types
of factual determinations that Dayton would seem to indicate.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Did the court in Dayton order racial

balance in every single school pursuant to some formula
MR. PORTER:

No, Mr. Justice Powell, not in

Dayton.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I was thinking about Swann.

I got the cases confused.

You were talking about Swann.

In Swann, was there any comparable order to the order in
Columbus ?
MR. PORTER:
recall.

I am not sure.

I'm sorry, I don't

I know very well what this Court said about Swann.
QUESTION:

I am talking about Swann.

MR. PORTER:
QUESTION:

Swann.
Yes.

MR. PORTER:

This Court discussed it as a start­

ing, point for the fashioning of a remedy, and we have no
problem with that.

What we say Is that you can't get to

the scope of the remedy until you determine what the mag­
nitude of the wrong is, and you can't supply the wrong or
its magnitude simply by the statement that it is a dual

12
system or that it is system-wide,

That is our position.

And I might say that in studying the lower
court’s opinions, one has to be very careful because it
is obvious after a reading or two that segregation is
related to a high degree within those opinions to racial
imbalance and, the two we would suggest are not the same,
but they are treated to a high degree the same.
QUESTION:

Mr. Porter, along the lines of

Justice Stevens* question, on page 73 of the appendix to
your petition, which has Judge Duncan's opinion, he says
that the finding of liability in this case concerns the
Columbus School District as a whole, actions and omissions
by public officials which tend to make black schools
black necessarily have the reciprocal effect of making
white schools whiter.

Do you think he would have found

a system-wide violation if there had just been segregation
in one school?
MR, PORTER:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I don't know how to answer that,
I think that the lower court, the

trial court felt that there were specific acts of uncon­
stitutional conduct, and I think he thought that they were
those ten or eleven which he identified, and I think that
he felt that there was racial imbalance throughout the
system, and I think that he felt that there was an obli­
gation to remove that racial imbalance, particularly

13
because he found that there was a dual school system in

195*1.

And he really runs down two tracks at the same time.

One is the dual school system, which he finds, required
the dismantling, the second is a separate line of specific
unconstitutional violations after 195**, and he puts them
all together.

I don't know that I can answer your ques­

tion.
QUESTION:

But don't you detect at least from

that part of his opinion that he perceived a ripple effect
from any unconstitutional act of segregation that would
eventually have made Its effect felt throughout the system?

MR. PORTER;

Well, he may have, although I don’t

think the record would support it.

But I would point out

that if that is so, that is the very reason that you need
to go to look to the effect to see what is the scope of
the remedy that is going to toe required in order to rectify
whatever that wrong was.
I might add with respect to reciprocal, the
reciprocal effect, there is very, very little in the
record on reciprocal effect.

I think the only testimony

in the record was from Mr. Sloan who said he had never
studied the Columbus system and he talked about it In a
general way.

Dr. Taeutoer may have mentioned It.

The

principal emphasis on reciprocal effect comes in the
appendix to the respondents' brief which was, of course,

not part of the record in this case»
I would like to talk Just briefly I think about
the matter of presumptions.

Before I do, 1 would like to

point out what the system looked like in 1976 at the time
of trial with regard to the violations that had been found

,

by the District Court, and there are some 11 or 13 depend­
ing on how you count them.
There was a group of so-called black schools en­
clave which he found had been created prior to the Second
World War or over a period of years.

Three of those

schools — three of the five remained in 1976, and they
housed 3 percent of the black students within the Columbus
Public School System.

He found that there were two sites

which he felt were unconstitutionally selected.

One of

them had been eliminated in 1973, with an integrative
effect,

One of them remained, and it was surrounded by

black schools.
There were three optional zones which he talked
about,

Two had been eliminated in the early sixties, one

In 1975, so that there were none at the time of trial, and
the one in 1975 Involved two youngsters and they went to
racially balanced schools.

There were two so-called dis­

contiguous zones, on© of which had been abolished in 1963,
and one of which he stated or the inference is from his
statements and the exhibits will show was integrative in

15

1968.
And finally there was the so-called pairing of
Innis and Cassady, where the school board and the court
disagree, and Innis at the time of trial was racially
balanced.
Now, these are the violations, and that is all
they were and
QUESTION:

Do you concede that these Mere con­

stitutional violations?
MR. PORTER;

We think that the evidence fully

supported, Your Honor, a finding to the contrary, but we
are not here to argue whether he was right or wrong.

That

i3 what Me have and our position is that he took that and
then used it to make presumptions of system-wide liability
and ~
QUESTION;

So for the purposes of this case in

its present posture, do you acknowledge that they were
constitutional violations?
MR. PORTER:

For the purposes of this case and

this Argument, we will not take issue with those findings,
QUESTION:
MR. PORTER:

And there were how many, three?
Over the 75 years, there are 11 or

13 findings or specific instances, depending on how one
counts them.

I think that is accurate.

They are set forth

in our brief and they are discussed in detail within the

brief,

.tad the point that we want to make is that you

can’t — I would point out that the record and his opinion
does not support the proposition that they are examples.
They are not examples, and his opinion is clear that they
are not examples.

They were his findings of fact.

QUESTION:
MR. PORTER:

They were the sum total.
They are the sum total, and this

is the springboard for the moving of some 37,000 people
and racially balancing 170 schools and —
QUESTION:

And racial segregation in public

schools has been illegal under the law of Ohio since,
what, the 1880’s?
MR. PORTER:

About 1887, and 1 think the Court

had found that this chool system racially balance begin­
ning in 1881.
QUESTION:

I thought it found that as far back

as 195^ the Columbus School System was segregated.

Judge

Duncan found that as a fact, didn't he?
MR. PORTER?
he found.

Mr. Justice Marshall, that is what

He also stated —
QUESTION:

is not true?

Well, would you say that statement

•

MR. PORTER?

The question I was addressing was

the
QUESTION:

You said that there wasn't any

17
segregation in Columbus sine© i860.

Isn’t that what you

said?
MR, PORTER;
QUESTION:

My response —
If you didn’t, I misunderstood you.

I thought that is what you said,
MR. PORTER:

My response to Mr. Justice Stewart

was that the Columbus Public School System was In an Inte­
grated system In 1881 and, as stated by Judge Duncan in
his opinion and order, that condition continued until the
early 1900?s.

It was his view then that there was a de­

parture about 1905 or 1906 which at that time resulted in
the establishment of what he found was the creation of a
black school.

QUESTION:

And in 195** it

MR, PORTER:

was segregated?

In 195*1, it was the lower court’s

view that there were five schools which constituted an
enclave in the center of the city which were the result
of unconstitutional —
QUESTION:

Is it true or not that Judge Duncan

said, "The Columbus public sseheols were openly and
intentionally segregated on the basis of race when Brown
was decided In 195*1.”
MR. PORTER:

Isn’t that what he said?
Yes9 Your Honor, it is.

The

Columbus Public School System was not a dual school system
in 195A3 and it was not a dual school system in 1976.

13
There was substantial racial mixing within the Columbus
Public School System in 1976.

If one will look at our

briefs for example.» there are some 13 high schools in ex­
istence at that times half of which were within the plus
or minus 15 percent of the racial balance requirement of
Judge Duna, half of the Columbus Public School high
schools, and several of them are within a point or two,
and it Is our position that under those circumstances you
do not,have a dual school system and you cannot use simply
the phrase Myou have system-wide liability dual school
system” as a jumping off point for ordering the reassign­
ment of 42,000 people.

And m think that Dayton Is correct.

We do not believe it is inconsistent with Keyes, which I
obviously am not going to got to, but we think that the
presumption in Keyes Is not inconsistent with Dayton.

The

presumption deals with intent, it deals with violation,
and there was no finding, no finding of a substantial
effect on the Columbus Public School System in 1976 of
any violation.

And it is our view that under those circum­

stances the District Court should not have ordered the
remedy that he ordered.
There Is a third matter that appears in our
brief, it deals with segregative Intent.
the wrong standard was used.
QUESTIONs

We believe that

We think that —

That la in determining whether or not

19
there was a constitutional violation —
MR. PORTER:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.
— any constitutional violations.

But you told us I thought that for purposes of this
argument you acknowledge that there were at least some
constitutional violations.
MR. PORTER:
Stewart.

That is corrects Mr. Justice

But five or six or eight or ten in a system of

170 square miles does not constitute a dual school
system, and it was used — it was then used by the
District Court and the Court of Appeals for the purpose
of equating whether or not the acts of the school system
tended to or did in fact improve racial balance, and we
suggest and argue to this Court that that is not the
appropriate way of going about it, that obviously the
school system, the neighborhood school system is going
to reflect the housing patterns of the community.

Some

vd.ll be balanced, some will not be, some will be close,
and so forth.
.1 would like to conclude simply by asking 'chls
Court or pointing out to the Court, I guess more accurately,
that in Ohio there are about six school cases going,
Cleveland,» Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati , Akron, and
Youngstown.

They are in various stages.

Several have

been tried.

Two have reached one result in the District

20
Court.

Two have reached another result.

And we think

that before a school system which is insolvent is asked to
go through massive relocations and massive reassignments,
that there should be —■ the District Court should be re­
quired to make very definite specific findings, and they
should be required to make the tyne of inquiry that Dayton
I calls for.

If it isn't Dayton I, with all due respect,

then It should be something else, but it should not be
sufficient — it should not be sufficient to simply say
in broad generalities that a condition exists, you go out
and remedy it.
There are many, many, many remedies, some of
which look to racial balancing.

This remedy was obviously

of racial balance, was the only thing considered by the
District Court, and it was the only thing considered by the
Court of Appeals, and we would suggest that it is inappro­
priate and that in order to deal with this type of situation,
at least in the State of Ohio, specific instructions from
this Court as to what the trial courts should do and the
type of findings that they should make, we would suggest
to this Court would be very helpful.
I wish to thank you for the opportunity to appear
here.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Atkins.

Mr. Porter, thank you.

21
ORAL ARGUMENT OP THOMAS I. ATKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, ATKINS:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to begin by simply stating what th®
respondents seek from this Court.

We ask that this Court

sustain th© finding made by the District Court below and
the Court of Appeals that indeed under the controlling legal
principles heretofore announced a dual system existed in
Columbus at the time of the Brown decision from this Court
and that the existence of that dual system imposed an
affirmative duty under Green, and we ask this Court on its
review of the record, as the District Court below and the
Court of Appeals below, to find default by the local
officials in carrying that affirmative responsibility, a
failure to dismantle the dual system.

We ask this Court

to reject the petitioners' proposition that you can treat
a system-wide cancer such as segregation with a band-aid,
and insteed to remain true to its holdings in Brown, in
j

V

Green, In Swann, in Keyes, in Milliken, and we believe in
Dayton, that where a system-wide violation has been shown
to exist only a system-wide remedy is capable of correcting
the condition that offends the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Mr. Atkins, you speak of the Court

remaining true to its teachings in Dayton, and 1 would like

22
to ask you about a finding of Judge Duncan and then ask you
about sdme language from Dayton on page 5B of the appendix
in Judge Duncan’s opinion.

He says in the middle of the

paragraph there * In the interaction of housing the
schools operates to promote segregation in each., it is not
now possible to isolate these factors and draw a picture
of what Columbus schools or housing would have looked like
today without, the other’s influence.
that such an attempt is required.

I do not believe

And then compare that

with our language in Daytons if violations are found the
District Court and the Court of Appeals must determine how
much incremental segregative effect these violations had
on the racial distribution of the Dayton school population
as presently constituted, and when that distribution is
compared to t^hat it would have been in the absence of such
constitutional violation.

Don’t you detect some inconsis­

tency there?
MR. ATKINS:

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst.

I read page 58 of the District Court’s opinion to be
simply another way of saying what this Court said in Swann
in addressing the question of the permissible scope of
transportation as a remedial implement, and it said we
cannot precisely define for every case how much will be
permissible.

It is not possible t© do.

The District Court,

after sitting through a trial with 70 witnesses, over TOO

23
exhibits and nearly 7,000 pages of transcript, said what
I have seen on the basis of the entire record before me is
segregative intent specifically carried out through active
actions of the public officials with an impact which is
system-wide in scope.

Here he speaks specifically to the

interaction between the school segregation the petitioners
caused and the housing segregation in the neighborhoods
around the schools.

He says here, as he does at other

points throughout his opinion, far from the schools being
segregated because the neighborhoods were segregated, the
neighborhoods are in part segregated because they segre­
gated the schools.

I don’t find any inconsistency here

and in this Court’s teaching in Dayton where it calls for
the most careful kind of scrutiny of the violations being
urged upon the District Court by whoever comes to it seek­
ing relief.
We believe and we think the record shows that
the District Court was very, very careful in evaluating
that record.

It fully credited the evidence offered by

the defendants.

It examined it carefully, it made in many

instances, as they have cited, statements about that
evidence.

It found by the clear convincing weight of all

of the evidence before it, including their evidence, that
there was system-wide segregation and that the segregation
was not advantageous.

QUESTION:

Well, what do you think the court

meant by "system-wide segregation"?

It certainly wasn't

the sort of system that you had in many southern states at
the time of Brown I where races were forbidden to attend
the same school by law,
MR, ATKINS:

I think the court recognized, as

this Court did in Keyes, that state action can take place
either by the passage of a law in a legislature or by the
action of a school official imbued with the power of the
state constitution and legislature.

It found in this case,

as in Keyes, that the state action which offended the
Constitution were the specific policies which pre-195^
created the five black schools overnight in several in­
stances , which had a specific policy of assigning all the
black faculty only to the black schools which, as my
brother counsel fails to point out to the Court, when
this Court found construction violations that created a
black school, it was also finding, as this Court has noted,
a reciprocal effect necessarily upon the white schools
whose boundaries were changed to accommodate the ware­
house being built for black students,
QUESTION:

But supposing that just happened once,

just one site selection taken place where they deliberately
segregated Intent on the part of one, do you think that
would justify a finding of system-wide segregation in a

25

school system the size of Columbus because of the ripple
effect?
MR. ATKINS:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnwulst, respond­

ents are not so arguing because we think that is not common
sense.
QUESTION:

Well, then what —

MR. ATKINS:

We think that a. finding of a single

violation with a single school, even taking into account
whatever reciprocal effects might have been, would cer­
tainly not justify a system-wide remedy and we are not
arguing that here.

That is not the facts here,

QUESTION:

Then what — there is some inter­

mediate finding, and I think everybody concedes —
MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— that the District Court has to

make between a single segregated act and the imposition
of a system-wide remedy.

What factors does the District

Court consider in making that finding?
MR. ATKINS:

I think the District Court and the

Court of Appeals, if I might say, each wrestled with that
problem, as indeed this Court has wrestled with it.
not an easy determination to make.

It is

Part of what goes into

making that determination is for the court to evaluate
the intent of the policymakers, because if the court finds
that what they set out to do, what they intended to do

26
was in every instance possible to segregate on the basis
of race, the fact that they may have been incompetent and
therefore unsuccessful in some instances Is not exculpatory.
That is a factor to be considered.

The court has to consider

whether the racial segregation in a particular school is
the result of patterns over which the school official did
not have control and could not be thought reciprocally to
have impacted.

Housing is such one instance, where it can

be shown their policies of segregation did not either pre­
cede or go lock-step with sep^regative policies on the part
of the other state in-power people such as realtors or
licensed people such as brokers.

That is a factor to be

taken into account.
This Court specifically noted that it took into
account the Columbus officials® system-wide policy with
respect to what to do xtfith black children in the pre-1954
era.

And the answer was clear, as the record shows, put

them in black schools wherever possible.

It said it con­

sidered the system-wide policy as related to faculty, a
policy which started at least as early as the beginning of
the century and which lasted at least as long as 1974 when
they couldn't do it any more because the state said stop.
QUESTION;

As I understand It, this lawsuit was

brought in, what, 1976?
MR. ATKINS;

'73

27
QUESTION:

'73.

MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:

The trial was 1975-76.
And the basis for the lawsuit was and

had to be a claim that the Columbus School Board was then
violating the law of the state of Ohio and the Constitution
of the United States by maintaining a dual school system.,
i.e., a school system, some schools for Negroes and other
schools for white people.

Is that It?

That was the claim,

wasn't it?
MR. ATKINS:

That was essentially the claim,

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And at that time how many all-white

or all-black schools were there in the system?
MR. ATKINS:

I must -- in attempting to respond

to that — complete the answer I didn’t want to fully give
when you were asking the question.

The claim in its

totality was that the school officials in Columbus had
set out on a deliberate policy to segregate the students
by race and that that included pre-Brown segregation and
specific maintenance of the segregated system after Brown.
At the time of trial —
QUESTION:

But the gist of the lawsuit had to be

that at the time of the lawsuit —
MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
the School Board of Columbus was

28
maintaining a school system that was illegal incidentally,
under the law of Ohio, and also most relevantly here under
the Constitution of the United States as of the time the
lawsuit was filed.

Isn’t that correct?

MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:
MR. ATKINS:

That5s correct.
Didn*t it have to be that?
And we believe the conclusion reached

by the court, both courts below, was that because of —
QUESTION:

First of all, would you answer before

you get too far aviay from my question —
MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— how many schools at that time were

all one-race schools?
MR. ATKINS:
the specific number.

All one-race schools, I don’t know
That was not the claim made by the

plaintiffs, that they were all one-race schools.
QUESTION:

Well, if it is a dual school system,

I should suppose that would be rather relevant evidence.
I mean if the claim was that -MR. ATKINS:

The evidence was before the court

and it is in this record before the Court in the appendices.
I don’t happen to recall the specific number of schools,
but the claim made by the plaintiffs was that the system
was segregated because the number of specific segregative
actions taken by the defendants unremedied infected a

29

substantial portion of the Columbus School System at the
time of trial.

That was the claim, and it was a claim

which on the basis of the record evidence before it, the
court credited it.

We believe the evidence in this case

will support a finding that — and the brief sets it out
more fully than I will attempt to do here —■ at least 77
specific constitutional violations affecting at least 1^9
schools during the period of time covered by the court’s
analysis.

This was not a case of Isolated instances.
QUESTION:

But the relevant time was the time

when the lawsuit was filed.
MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION;

I understand.
And the claim had to be as of that

time —
MR. ATKINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
—- the Columbus School Board was

administering an officially segregated system.
MR. ATKINS:

I understand.

And at the time of

trial
QUESTION:

And I would suppose that evidence

quite relevant to that was how many schools as of that
time were all white or all black.
MR. ATKINS:

The evidence at the time of trial

showed, as I recall the statistics, that 70 percent of the
black students then In Columbus elementary schools were In

30

schools which had been mentioned by record evidence before
the District Court as having been specifically impacted by
segregative activity.
QUESTION:

Of course, that doesn’t answer my

question at all, does it?
MR, ATKINS:

I have already answered the question

to the extent I can,
QUESTION:
MR, ATKINS:

You don’t know,
As I say, I don’t know the specific

number of schools,
QUESTION:
MR. ATKINS:

All right.
But that information was before the

courts below, as it is here.

We find the effort by the

petitioners to suggest that this Court should disregard
the remedial principles that have so clearly and we think
consistently set forth to be a claim which should be re­
jected, a plea which should be rejected by this Court,

We

believe the record shows that both the District Court and
the Court of Appeals, with full regard to the teachings of
this Court, evaluated the evidence to determine first the
scope of impact from the violations which had been com­
mitted, secondly, the extent to which the defendants carried
the burden this Court lias imposed to show that other
segregation which existed was not also the result of their
Impermissible activity and, third, to articulate a remedial

31
plan formulated by the defendants capable of addressing
the full reach of the violation.

We believe that has

happened and we think the efforts on the one hand to
characterize the record as a record showing only isolated
instances,on the other hand to ignore the substantial
basis for the District Court's finding of a pre-Brown dual
system to ignore the continuing segregative activity this
Court, the courts found below to have been carried out by
these defendants specifically through the us® of optional
zones and discontiguous areas, not solely the use of con­
struction but including that, by the faculty and adminis­
trative assignment policies they created and carried out,
we believe on that record the remedy ordered below is
appropriate and we ask this Court to affirm that remedy
and to permit the students in Columbus to receive for the
first time in a century fully adequate and fully constitu­
tional education in the public school systems, because
the record is clear.

If you don't permit that to happen,

the petitioners will eeratinly not make it happen.
We have no place to go from here.

We cannot go

back there expecting a difference from the pattern of be­
havior which has up to this point been proven and found,
tod we ask this Court, we are approaching the 25th anni­
versary of the Brown decision, in Columbus it hasn't meant
a thing and we ask this Court to send Brown to Columbus.

32
I thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Atkins.

Mr. Days.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. DAYS:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before I turn to matters that I want to specific”
ally address in my argument, I would like to try to answer
Mr. Justice Stewart's question with respect to the state of
segregation at the time that this case was broup’ht to trial.
At the time of trial, the statistics reflect that
the district was 32 percent black, 70 percent of the black
children attended schools that were 80 percent or better
and 50 percent of the schools were 90 percent of one race
or the other.

So there was a high degree of racial

segregation.
QUESTION:

That really doesn't answer my question

either, does it?
MR. DAYS:

Well, I was simply trying to assist

the Court based upon —
QUESTION:

The schools that ware involved in

Brown v. Board of Education were all black schools and all
white schools officially, weren't they?
MR. DAYS:

That's correct.

33
QUESTION:

Were there any of these in Columbus?

MR. DAYS:

There were virtually all black schools

in Columbus at the time of trial.
QUESTION:

Were there any of the kind that were

dealt with in Brown v. Board of Education?
MR. DAYS:

I would think not because of the

record in this case which is that there was no state
statute in effect at the tirae.
QUESTION:

That is what I am asking yous what

does the record show in this case.
MR. DAYS:

The record in this case shows that it

was not the type of complete segregation that was in effect
in —
QUESTION:

And that xtfas what was involved in

the Brown case,
MR. DAYS:

That9s correct.

QUESTION:

And you would agree, I suppose,

General Days, would you not, that it is pretty well estab­
lished that what the Constitution requires is a school
system that is racially neutral, that no child and no
parent of that child has any constitutional right to attend
a particular school with any particular race or racial
balance?
MR. DAYS:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

I think

it is also helpful to understand that while there were

3*i

some schools in the district at the time of trial that were
majority black and majority white, they reflected a contin­
uation of a pattern that was in effect in 1954 when the
court found that five schools were 100 percent all black
not only in terms of their student body but their faculty,
QUESTION:

I suppose if you went back to 1854

you could find that there were no schools for Negroes at
all.
MR. DAYS:

I think that Is part of the —•

QUESTION:

And that all the schools were 100

percent white.
MR. DAYS:

I think that the information with re­

spect to the condition of the schools in 1954 reflects the
fact that there was an express constitutional responsibility
on the part of the board as of 1954 to try to dismantle a
system that was for all intents and purposes dual, given
the totality of the circumstances.
Eut what I would like to turn to is really —
QUESTION:

Mr. Days, before you get to that, you

did mention teachers.
MR. 'DAYS:

Teachers.

QUESTION:

Weren’t all Negro teachers exclusively

in Negro schools?
MR. DAYS:
one exception.

That’s correct.

I think there was

35
QUESTION:

And is that why the suit was brought?

MR. DAYS:

No, not at the time the suit, in 195*i.

But of course, at the time that this suit was filed, the
Columbus School Board had not dismantled the system that
involved racial assignment of teachers.

It was not until

1974, a year after the suit was filed, that the Columbus
School Board finally started assigning teachers not based
upon their race but based upon neutral principles.
In our view, the Court of Appeals correctly ap­
plied the principles of Dayton in view of its determination
that a system-wide violation existed.

And Mr. Porter has

indicated here today that he accepts those findings for
purposes of this argument.

Therefor®, Columbus is a remedy

ease.
In holding that judicial remedies must be
addressed to the incremental segregated effects of a school
board's discriminatory policies, Dayton I did not establish
new principles, we would argue.

Rather, it reiterated the

settled precept that a remedy must be tailored to cure the
condition that offends the Constitution by eradicating the
effects of that violation.
V’hcn there have been only isolated and spradio
acts of school board discrimination affecting a limited
number of schools or students, a similarly limited remedy
is appropriate.

This is what we understand to be the

36
teaching of Dayton.
On the other hand, where there has been a
general policy of discrimination in the operation
school system as a whole, pervasively eliminating whatever
opportunities existed for substantial racial integration,
a system-wide remedy will generally be required.
QUESTION?

Mr. Days, what factor does the court

consider or what findings ought it to make in distinguish­
ing between the two types of cases that you have just
described?
MR. DAYS:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that is

an issue that was not directly addressed in the Dayton de­
cision.

It does not address what we think is the central

issue here which is the proper allocation of the burden of
proof at the remedial stage when a court must enter a
decree that delineates the discriminatory patterns, root
and branch.

We think that based upon the teachings of

Swann and Keyes the burden of showing to what extent the
system-wide remedies inappropriate falls upon the school
board,

Keyes and Swarm established that there is a rebut­

table presumption that school board practices that have
been system-wide have a system-wide effect.

It presumes

that the discriminatory practices have achieved their full
potential in the school system.
QUESTION:

Regardless of the presumptions, what

37
is the issue?
MR. DAYS:

What is the issue?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. DAYS:

It seems to me that the issue has to

be a showing by the school board of ways in which its own
discriminatory pattern did not in fact have an impact
upon specific schools or specific areas of a system, but
that burden falls upon the school board.
QUESTION?

Well, do you say that if you proved

even, one isolated segregated instance that that would
shift the burden to the school board in a school district
of 176 schools like this, to show that none of the others
have been affected?
MR. DAYS:

We do not contend that.

QUESTION:

Well, where is the tipping point?

MR. DAYS:

Well, the tipping point is when the

court finds that there is a system-wide violation, that
is where the discriminatory practices infect the entire
system.
QUESTION:

And what questions does it ask itself

to make that determination?
MR. DAYS:

Well, I would suggest, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that It is not for the court to ask questions
of itself, it Is for the school board to make showings of
ways In which, for example, the racial assignment of

38
faculty did not have an impact upon certain schools,
QUESTION:

But you have said if there is just

one school and one isolated thing* the burden doesn't
shift, it is not up to the school board.
MR. DAYS:

That's right, because by definition

if it is an isolated violation, then one can easily deter­
mine, a court can easily determine what the remedy will be
QUESTION:

So at what point does the burden

MR. DAYS:

The burden shifts when there is an

shift?

establishment of a system-wide violation.

I think if we

look at the record in this case, where the court pursued
questions of whether faculty assignments were discrimina­
tory, whether siting policies were discriminatory, whether
optional sones and discontiguous sones were discriminatory
Once it arrived at a judgment that the system was segre­
gated, then the burden shifted to the school board, and
in determining what constitutes® system-wide violation
courts really have to look to the decisions of this Court.
We think that it is appropriate after Dayton to
continue to believe that the burden for showing the incre­
mental segregative effects should fall upon the school
board.

If there is a risk of uncertainty, it should not

b® borne by the victims of the legal action.

This is

particularly applicable in cases such as this inhere

39
•plaintiffs seek to vindicate rights that are at the core
of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The victims of purposeful

school segregation are entitled to a remedy that eliminates
the effects of discrimination, root and branch,, and clearly
a system-wide remedy would achieve that end because it
would remove the racial identlflability of the dual system.
But it would also visibly rectify the stigma of inferiority
which is indeed the product of pervasive violations.
If a school board wishes to contend that a less
inclusive decree would purge all taints of its proven
system-wide racial discrimination, it has the burden of
showing exactly what that limitation entails.

In this case,

the Columbus Board did not carry this burden.

As the trial

court stated, the defendants had ample opportunity at trial
to show if they could that the admitted racial imbalance
of Columbus Public Schools is a result of social dynamics
or of the acts of others for which defendants owed no re­
sponsibility .

This they did not do.

In our estimation, given the establishment of a
system-wide violation and the failure on the part of the
Columbus School Board to show why that system-wide violation
did not warrant a system-wide remedy —
QUESTION:

General Days, Judge Duncan said h@

wouldn't even attempt to consider the influence of housing.
What other social dynamics could the school board have

40
called to his attention?
MR, DAYS:

Judge Duncan, when he issued the

statement that Your Honor quoted earlier, was of course
operating without the guidance of Dayton.

That was a

March opinion and, of course, Dayton came down several
months later.

After the Dayton decision came down, I

think the trial court understood that there might be a
variety of considerations, but the school board had that
burden and X think that, as this Court has Indicated in
Swann, where there are certainly one-race schools that
remain after there has been a showing of a violation,
the school board has to come forward and show v;hy those
one-race schools do not reflect the continuation of the
dual system.
X think what this Court’s decisions have indi­
cated is that these types of decisions have to be made on
an ad hoc basis, on a case by case basis, given the circum­
stances of that case.
QUESTION:

Didn’t Swann also make clear, very

clear that there was no constitutional requirements of
racial balance to reflect the communities?

■i

'

MR. DAYS:
t

\

That’s correct.

..

QUESTION:

And we said in Swann that If that is

what we found, we would have reversed.
MR. DAYS:

That’s correct.

We would have disproved what the

That Is what Swann says, Your Honor.

question.

MR. DAYS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Mr. Days, could I ask you one more

Th© government has briefed both of these cases

together and can we assume from that and from the comment
on page 44 of your brief that you don’t regard it as
;

significant that Judge Duncan's findings were affirmed by

I
the Court of Appeals and Judge Reubens'were reversed?
MR. DAYS:

I think there is a significances Your

Honors but I don’t think one that should have great consequence, because I think in the Dayton case the Court of
Appeals had had. a great deal of experience vilfch the facts*
had gone through the record on several occasions.

So to

the extent that the Court of Appeals made factual determin­
ations Itself * I believe that those findings should be
upheld by this Court.
QUESTION:

Is there some authority around for

Courts of Appeals entering their own findings when they set
aside District Court findings, finding them unsupported
as clearly erroneous?
MR. DAYS:

Mr. Justice Whit® —

QUESTION:

Is there some authority for that?

MR. DAYS:

I don’t have that authority at the

tip of my tongue, Mr. Justice White, but I think as a gen­
eral matter1 Courts of Appeals would remand for further
determinations using proper principles, but I think it is
not unusual nor irregular for a Court of Appeals under
the circumstances of a case such as this to make its own
determinations.
QUESTION:

Can you suggest any one ease In which

that h&s been done, Mr. Days?
MR. DAYS;

Well, I recabl that in the Fifth

Circuit Court of Appeals, in the Austin case, at several
earlier stages, the Court of Appeals made its own deter­
minations based upon the record facts that were available
to it.

So we don’t have a Court of Appeals either there

/

or here making determinations outside the record, but
simply drawing from the record facts that types of deduc­
tions that the case law warrants.
Thank you.
