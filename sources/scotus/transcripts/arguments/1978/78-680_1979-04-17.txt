PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning In Hutchinson v. Proxmire and others.
Mr. Cavanaugh, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. CAVANAUGH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Michael Cavanaugh, of Lansing, Michigan,
appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Dr. Ronald Hutchinson.
This is a civil action by Dr. Hutchinson, a research
scientist, against a United States Senator, William Proxmire,
and his aide, Morton Schwartz:, seeking damages for libel,
slander, interference with contractual relations and invasion
of privacy and intentional Infliction of mental anguish.
The basis of federal jurisdiction Is diversity of
citizenship.

In March of 1975, Senator Proxmire launched a

series of monthly press releases which were designed,
according to Senator Proxmire, to focus national attention
upon what he considered as the greatest waste of taxpayer
money that could be located that month.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cavanaugh, could I Interrupt you for

a moment?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, sir.

4
QUESTION:

You said the basis of jurisdiction is

diversity of citizenship.

I take it then that it is state law

of some state that forms the substantive basis for your claim
of libel and slander?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, Your Honor, ultimately state

law will be applied.
QUESTION:

What state, Wisconsin?

MR, CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, there are three possible

choices, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia, and the State of
Michigan.

We believe that the appropriate state law to be

applied would be the State of Michigan.

The petitioner re­

sides in the State of Michigan, the publication was nationwide
but the greatest impact would be In the State of Michigan and
we think under the Wisconsin choice of law provisions that It
would look to the impact of the tort and that Michigan law
would be applied.
QUESTION:

But it would be a question of Wisconsin
f

choice of law?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That is correct, Your Honor.

It is our contention, Your Honors, that a review of
the press releases issued by Senator Proxmlre that are con­
tained in this record, along with the evidence that relates
to them, will show that the press releases typically will
take a small part of a research project, distort it and then
indicate that the full amount of the research grant was

0

granted for that project.

The press releases are typically

filled with sarcasm and humilitates the researcher involved.
In April of 1975, Dr. Hutchinson was selected for
the Golden Fleece of the Month Award.

The Golden Fleece

issued for Dr. Hutchinson contained inflammatory and untrue
statements.
made:

The following statements, among others, were

"The Government paid a half million dollars to find

out that anger, stopping smoking, and loud noises produce
jaw clenching.

All of this money was given to Dr. Hutchinson,

of Kalamazoo State Hospital.

In fact, the good doctor has

made a fortune from his monkeys, and in the process made a
monkey of the American taxpayer."
The press release also stated that Dr. Hutchinson's
research work was perhaps duplicative.
In the course of the depositions, the respondents
have admitted, that prior to issuance of the press release,
they knew that the $500,000 did not go to Dr, Hutchinson
personally but, rather, was paid to the State of Michigan and
used by the State of Michigan to pay salaries, to pay for
supplies, overhead and similar expenses.
As far as the statement that in fact the good
doctor has made a fortune from his monkeys, the respondents
contended in deposition that this was merely a reflection of
Dr. Hutchinson’s status and power as a researcher and a re­
flection of his income which they claim is among the highest

6
percentages of income in the United States.

In fact, at the

time the Fleece was issued, Dr, Hutchinson's salary from the
State was $30,000, which was the highest at any time covered
by the Fleece.

The period of time he served as a collep;e

professor, his salary would have been considerably less.
In depositions, the respondent also admitted that
prior to the issuance of the press release, they received
statements from the funding agencies that gave the true nature
of Dr. Hutchinson's work.

The Office of Naval Research and

the National Aeronautics and Space Administration particularly
gave statements to the respondents which indicated that Dr.
Hutchinson had for the first time given those agencies an
accurate method of detecting and measuring aggression.
Navy hoped to use that
submarine crews.

The

research in training and selecting

NASA hoped to use that research in selecting

crews for long-range space missions.
In addition to the press release, the respondents
issued a newsletter in April of 1975 which repeated many of
the same defamatory statements.

This newsletter was sent to

over 100,000 persons, some of whom resided in the Senator's
home State of Wisconsin and some of whom did not.

A second

newsletter was issued in February of 1976 which also referred
to Dr. Hutchinson.
In addition, Senator Proxmire made statements re­
garding Dr. Hutchinson's work on radio and television,

f
including the Mike Douglas Show, where the Senator referred
to Dr. Hutchinson’s work as "the most outrageous example of
wasteful, extravagant and stupid spending."
In addition to these activities —
QUESTION:

On that broadcast, am I correct in re­

membering that Dr. Hutchinson’s name was not mentioned?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, his name was not men­

tioned but his work was —
QUESTION:

So your answer Is yes?

MR. CAVANAUGH:

That’s correct.

His work was

specified in such detail that he could be identified from
what was said.

In fact, there are affidavits In the record.

Your Honor, which indicate that people did recognise that Dr.
Hutchinson was being referred to.

The prior press release

issued by Senator Proxmire certainly aided in the identifica­
tion later of Dr. Hutchinson.
QUESTION:

Isn’t there some question about whether

or not there was more than one broadcast?

I know you say

there were at least two.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

We know of one other for certain,

is the Bob Barry Show, which is referred to in the record.
In addition, there may have been other ones.

The Senator

Indicated in his deposition that he could not recall if there
were other ones.

I believe there are some affidavits In the

record which we filed from people who indicated that they

8
believed that they heard mention of this sort of thing on other
entertainment-type television shows.
In addition to these actions, after the press release
was issued the Senator’s aide made telephone calls to the
various funding agencies.

During some of these calls, defam­

atory statements were made and pressure was apparently exerted
on those agencies to cause them to cease funding Dr.
Hutchinson's work.
Dr. Hutchinson filed suit and the defendants moved
for summary judgment on the basis of the speech or debate
clause in the First Amendment.
summary judgment.

The District Court granted

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals

affirmed, holding, one, that the press release and the news­
letters were absolutely immune under the speech or debate
clause, even though they may have contained defamatory mater­
ial,

Secondly, the Court of Appeals held that the radio and

television Interviews and the calls to the funding agencies
to seek termination of the research grants were not immune
under the speech or debate clause but they were protected
under the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

Didn’t the District Court make that same

conclusion?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, the District Court would

have extended speech or debate I believe to those items as
well, but It is correct that the District Court in addition

9
found that petitioner Hutchinson was a public figure and
therefore there was protection under the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

So the Court of Apoeals affirmed that

part of it.
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.

Well, when you talk about findings and so

forth, this case went off on summary judgment against your
client.
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

So we are not talking about a finding of

fact on a disputed Issue where the Court of Appeals affirms
on a clearly erroneous basis.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That is exactly right, Your Honor.

In fact, one of our contentions Is that Dr. Hutchinson is
entitled to a trial on the merits so that a jury or other
trier of the facts can consider this evidence and any infer­
ences that can be drawn from it.
QUESTION:

Can I ask you, as I read the District

Court's opinion, the District Court also reached the state law
question of whether these remarks were defamatory.

10
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

And ruled that they were not.

MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

That Is correct, Your Honor.

That is correct.

Now, this is a state law issue, I take it,

isn’t it ?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Isn't it?

MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

Yes.

You told Mr. Justice Stewart that it was

going to be local law that would govern this case.
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

That Is correct.

And if these remarks were not defamatory,

what excuse is there for ever reaching the First Amendment
Issue at least?

I am not talking about speech or debate.

MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit

Court did not reach the state law issue.

It would appear

t hat —
QUESTION:

I know, but isn’t it the usual rule you

reach non-constitutional issues first?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, Your Honor, I would think that

if —
QUESTION:

Well, what if the Court of Appeals had

affirmed the District Court on the ground that these remarks
were not defamatory, would there be any constitutional issues
in the case?

11
MR, CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, to sneak frankly, I think

the Court’s decision in Paul v. Davis would Indicate that the
torts involved do not invade constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

Well, Paul v. Davis is a 1983 case.

This

is a case based upon state tort law, isn't it?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, Your Honor, It is.

Your Honor,

In Paul v. Davis, the Court considered whether invasion of
privacy could .rise to a constitutional level, and Justice
Rehnquist writing for the Court Indicated that there are only
certainly limited areas in which an Invasion of privacy would
rise to a constitutional level.

Therefore, while we would

hope to view this as a constitutional issue, I think realist­
ically the Court has discussed that at least in dicta in Paul
v. Davis if not In —
QUESTION:

Well, why should we reach either the

First Amendment issue or the speech or debate clause if the
District Court is right, that this wasn't defamatory anyway?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, we believe that the

District Court was clearly erroneous in not —
QUESTION:

That may be so, but the Court of Appeals

hasn't said so and we rarely disagree with lower courts on
what the state law is.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That Is correct, Your Honor.

The

Court of Appeals did not reach the issue and we would hope
that the Court would remand for a determination on that issue

12
after the Court would rule on the —
QUESTION:

Why would we rule on the constitutional

Issue?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

Because we granted certiorari?

That may

be a good answer.
(Laughter)
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, that was an answer 1 was

embarrassed to give.
QUESTION:

Yes.,

MR. CAVANAUGH:

I think the other answer is that the

District Court clearly was erroneous on the state law.
QUESTION:

I suppose you contend that you are en­

titled to have the Court of Appeals pass on the question of
state law just the way you would in any other appeal from the
District Court to the Court of Appeals, even though the con­
stitutional question shouldn't be reached?
MR, CAVANAUGH:

That is correct , Your Honor, the

petitioner has a right to review and that review should en­
compass at least the threshold issue.
Your Honor, I would like to in my remarks today
speak to two issues.

The first is speech or debate,, and the

second is the public figure issue.

Article I, Section 6 of

the Constitution provides that Senators and Representatives
for any speech or debate in either House shall not be

13
questioned In any other place.
QUESTION:

Before you get on to that, is there In

your position the notion that whether or not he is a public
figure, is a jury issue which cannot be resolved by the court?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Summary judgment.

MR. CAVANAUGH:
tion.

Your Honor --

Your Honor, that would be our posi­

Our position is that a jury should be allowed to review

the facts and the inferences that can be drawn from those
facts to decide whether or not the petitioner is a public
figure.
QUESTION:

Then you must mean that, among other

things, that is an issue which cannot be resolved, is a
factual issue which cannot be resolved on affidavits, only by
a trial of the issues, is that it?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, Your Honor, it would appear

appropriate to reverse the lower decisions and permit the
petitioner to have a trial on the issue.
In understanding our speech or debate position, It
is as important to understand what we do not challenge as It
is to understand what we do challenge.
any speech by Senator Proxmlrs.

We do not challenge

We do not ehablenge the

insertion of a speech in the Congressional Record.

We do not

challenge any vote or any action taken in Congress or in
committee.

14
We do challenge the defamatory press release that
wa3 given massive publicity, two defamatory newsletters that
were given similar dissemination, radio and TV appearances
and the telephone calls to the funding agencies to seek ter­
mination of Dr. Hutchinson's funding.
QUESTION:

Did you say there were 100,000 of these

press releases sent out?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yea, that's correct. Your Honor.

Each press release was sent to over 100,000 persons.
QUESTION:

All in Wisconsin?

MR. CAVANAUGH:

No, Your Honor, some were in

Wisconsin and some were in other states.
QUESTION:

Does the record show what the spread was

on the —
MR. CAVANAUGH:

No, Your Honor.

The only statement

I believe is in Senator Proxmire’s deposition, where he indi­
cated that some of those press releases were sent to Wisconsin
and others were sent outside of the state.
QUESTION:

Were those press releases or newsletters?

MR. CAVANAUGH:

I'm sorry, newsletters.

All of the

press releases were sent to the media.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CAVANAUGH:

This Court in the recent past has

said on at least three occasions that publications or republi­
cations outside of Congress are not protected by the speech or

15
debate clause.

In United States v. Brewster, a criminal

bribery case, the Court pointed out that Congressmen engage
In many activities that are political in nature rather than
legislative.

Specifically mentioned were newsletters, news

releases and speeches outside of Congress.

The Court then

commented that it has never seriously been contended that
these political matters are protected by the speech or debate
clause.
In Gravel v. United States, private publication of
the Pentagon Papers was found not to be essential to the de­
liberations of the Senate and not part and parcel of the
legislative process, hence it was not protected by speech or
debate.
In Doe v. McMillan, it was held that committee
members who compiled and voted to publish a report were
Immune under the speech or debate clause, but the Court made
It very clear that the speech or debate clause does not pro­
tect a private republication of documents introduced and
made public at a committee hearing.

The Court went so far as

to say that if a member of Congress republished libel by
reading from a record, from a congressional committee record
in his home district, he would not be immune under the speech
or debate clause.
And these recent statements by the Court comply
with the historical understanding of the speech or debate

16
clause.

Justice Story, 145 years ago, in the Commentaries

on the Constitution of the United States, stated that if a
Congressman republished a defamatory statement that was
originally made in Congress, he would not be immune.
I think it is worth noting how far the defendants
have gone in this case beyond the conduct in Doe.

In Doe,

the defendants acted as a congressional committee and they
did nothing more than prepare the report and vote along with
the rest of the House for its publication.
Here we have one Congressman issuing his own press
release and his own newsletters.
very limited.

In Doe, the publication was

It was limited to 1,682 copies that were sent

to other Congressmen and to the usual offices that receive
printings.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cavanaugh, what would you say if

they just mailed out the Congressional Record?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, I think then we would

have a question of how wide was the dissemination.

If the

dissemination —
QUESTION:

The same mailing list you have got here.

MR. CAVANAUGH:
not be protected.

Your Honor, I would think it would

I think that that is dissemination beyond

a legitimate needs of Congress and therefore would not be
protected.
QUESTION:

But if the Congress for some reason or

17
other sent the same copy of the Congressional Record out -MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, if it was an action

taken by Congress, I believe that it would be immune.
QUESTION:

Or a committee?

MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, sir.

But if the action is

taken by an individual Congressman and it is disseminated
beyond legitimate legislative needs, then it would not be
immune.
In Doe, in addition to the publication being limited,
there was no effort to call attention to it.

In the present

case, every possible effort was made to call attention to the
news release.

In short, In the present case, we do not have

Congress taking action or a committee taking action, we have
one Senator Issuing a press release, Issuing a newsletter and
giving it the widest possible dissemination.

This is not

Immune under the speach or debate laws.
If I may, I would like to turn to the public figure
issue.

This Court in Gertz v. Helen indicated that there are

two types of public figure.

First there was the all-Purrose

public figure, which was described as a person with pervasive
power and influence, pervasive fame and notoriety.

The Court

of Appeals and the parties In this case are in agreement that
Dr. Hutchinson does not satisfy that definition.
QUESTION:

Now, before you get into this nubile

figure business or public official, those concepts have been

18
deemed important in the decisions and opinions of this Court
when the alleged false defamatory material has been published
by some instrumentality of the public news media, isn't
that correct?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Is there any case here that holds that

the so-called New York Times rules are applicable when the
defamatory statement has been made by an individual person,
human being?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, that is

an issue that we have specifically not conceded.

The

respondents in their brief indicated in a footnote that ap­
parently we had conceded the point that the same standard
applies to public or to private defendants as would apply to
a member of the media.

Your Honor, we do not think that is

correct, the Court has not yet addressed that issue.

Chief

Justice Burger in a recent concurring opinion pointed that
out, that the Court had not yet squarely faced that issue,
and there is considerable speculation in the legal commmunity
that perhaps different standards do apply —
QUESTION:

Well, there are some decisions in state

courts the other way, aren’t there?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, there are.

So It may be that whether or not your

client is a public figure is totally irrelevant.

19
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

It may well be that way, Your Honor.

You dorrt brief or argue this basic

question?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
have not is simply this:

No, we have not, and the reason we
The Nevr York Times involved both

media defendants and non-media defendants.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CAVANAUGH:

It would annear from the ruling in

New York Times that there was an assumption that the same rule
would apply to both types of defendants.

Now, since that time

in Gertz and in the other public figure cases, the court seems
to rather carefully Indicated that the defendant was a media
defendant.

But, Your Honor, for purposes of argument we have

assumed that the same standard would anolv but I think that
the Court has not foreclosed the possibility that different
standards would apply to the two types of defendants.
QUESTION:

And although you have assumed it, you

reserve the privilege of arguing that It doesn’t.
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

But you are not arguing it here.

MR. CAVANAUGH:

That is correct. Your Honor.

The Court of Appeals held that Dr. Hutchinson fell
within the second category of public figures, the limited
public figures.

These were described as people who have

voluntarii thrust themselves into the forefront of a particular

public controversy in order to influence the resolution of
the issue involved.

In other places in the opinion, these

persons were referred to as persons who had voluntary in­
jected themselves into an issue, persons who had assumed
special prominence in the resolution of a particular dispute.
The Court of Appeals relied on four factors in
finding, that Dr. Hutchinson was a limited public figure.
First, the court relied upon his solicitation of federal
funds; second, the nublished articles about Dr. Hutchinson's
work; third, about the stories that appeared about Dr.
Hutchinson in local newspapers; fourth, the court relied upon
the fact that it believed Dr. Hutchinson had sufficient access
to the media to reply to the statement.

To these four grounds,

the respondents would add a fifth, which is that Dr.
Hutchinson's research department was the subject of a public
audit in the State of Michigan after the press release,
apparently after the first newsletter and after the telephone
calls to the funding agencies but prior to some of the other
publications.
QUESTION:

Well, that is almost like going back to

the plurality opinion in Metro Media v. Rosenberg, isn’t it?
If you say something bad about a nerson and it is published,
that makes him a public figure.
MR. CAVANAUGH:
Your Honor.

I think that is exactly right,

It is a bootstrap argument, that anyone who is

21
defamed by a United States Senator is going to become a public
figure and there is going to be a -—
QUESTION:

By the very fact of his defamation.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, sir, and he is going to have

some access to the media because the media will call him for
his response.

So the very nubile defendant such as a Senator

could make anyone a public figure if that were the test.
QUESTION:

Well, the media always could.

MR. CAVANAUGH:

That's right, Your Honor.

In regard to Dr. Hutchinson's publications, his
publications have consisted of four or five chapters in books
and several articles that he has published.
scholarly articles setting forth

All of those were

the results of his research.

They did not advocate a position of public funding, they did
not seek to thrust him to the forefront of any issue Involving
the continuation of public funding.
It is important to note that in Gertz the Court
noted that Mr. Gertz had published many articles and many
books, yet he was shown not to be a public figure.
In regard to the articles that appeared in the
local papers, in fact there was only one local caper, and out
of the seven stories that appeared, only one can be called a
true story, the other six x^ere simply notices indicating that
Dr. Hutchinson had been promoted at the university or something

22
of that nature.
The publication that there was about Dr. Hutchinson
nrior to this release was limited solely to one newspaper in
Kalamazoo.

This is in startling contrast to the publication

in Firestone.

Justice Marshall in his dissent pointed out

that Mrs. Firestone had been the subject of over 80 newspaper
articles during the course of the divorce proceedings, yet
she was found not to be a public figure.
Qhe last item mentioned by the Court of Anneals was
the receipt of federal funding.

As the brief of the amicus

curiae, the American Psychological Association, points out,
over 72 percent now of research that is related to universi­
ties is funded by the United States Government.

If that were

the test, we would be making virtually every researcher a
public figure.
But more Importantly than that, merely by seeking
public funds, a researcher does not thrust himself Into the
forefront of any public :_ssue, so we would submit that that
cannot be the test.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cavanaugh, if he Is going to ask for

— what did he get, $900,000 or something like that, according
to the footnote In Judge Leighton's opinion, shouldn't he be
prepared to defend In a public forum the appropriateness of
that kind of spending by the government?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, the $900,000, as I

23
mentioned earlier, $900,000 is a high figure.
thing less than that.
or $800,000,

It was some­

It was in the neighborhood of $700,000

But at any rate, the money was nald by the

federal agencies to the State of Michigan or to the other
sponsoring authority.

The research before it is funded is

carefully evaluated by the funding agencies in a peer review
of —
QUESTION:

Well, it may have been entirely proper,

I don’t suggest that, but when you do get involved in seeking
public funds of that magnitude, isn't it appropriate to con­
sider that you must be prepared to defend publicly the ex­
penditure of that kind of money?

Doc on ¥ *u- t/iiui i/ 3^. on i*5 o aeon-

able?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, I think while the re­

searcher should be prepared to defend his funding he should
not be given the status of public figure so that he has to
rise to the high level of meeting actual malice before he
can maintain an action.

Because in addition to the researcher

defending the action, the agencies themselves that fund it
can defend the action, and that Is where 1 think the public
or a Congressman should look for justification, rather than
the researcher.
QUESTION:

But doesn’t he know that this is the

kind of thing that is typically a subject of public debate
and newspaper articles and there might be careless comment

on where it Roes, when you get into the appropriations area?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, if we accented that

standard we would be back to the Metro Media standard which
is that it is a matter of general interest to the public and
therefore anyone who happens to be involved in it can be
slandered and you must snow actual malice before you can re­
cover.

The Court has left that —
QUESTION:

It was just more of a nubile issue than

the public person.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Yes, sir.

Your Honor, I would like to reserve whatever time I
have remaining for rebuttal.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr.

Cavanaugh.

Mr. Raywid.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN RAYWID, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RAYWID:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
A proper assessment of this case we maintain requires
some examination of the facts of how Congress actually oper­
ates.

I itfould like to review a few pertinent facts.

In the

year of the filing of this suit, President Ford had submitted
a budget to the Congress of just short of $*4 00 billion.

In

that budget was some $25 billion allocated for research and
development.

That year proved to be an all-time high of $76

25

billion in deficits.
The competitors for research and development funds
included such national interest topics as energy research,
national defense, environment, and health.

It is an annual

ritual when this budget is submitted to the Congress that a
review take place which spans most of the legislative year.
That review process is the responsibility first of the
Appropriations Committee and many of its subcommittees.

It

conducts hearings, along with a formal review process and a
report to the Congress and legislation submitted to the
Congress is an informal review process that goes on continu­
ally throughout that year.

That Is, the budget officers In

each, of these various agencies contact the Appropriations
staff and they exchange Information and they are asked to
give more support for some particular Items, to eliminate
some items, and to get the budget into what the Conppcess
deems to be a proper shape.

That same process is going on

in the House in parallel committees similarly structured.
QUESTION:

Now, are these observations directed at

the speech or debate clause, the First Amendment issue, or
what ?
MR. RAYWID:

Principally the speech or debate issue.

It also touches upon First Amendment but principally speech
or debate, Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Mr, Raywid, could you comment just

briefly on why we should reach that issue here if the Court
of Appeals could have disposed of the case on a state law
ground?
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

Well —
I take it the Court of Appeals didn't

deal with the state law ground at all?
MR. RAYWID:

That is correct.

When the speech or

debate immunity is raised by a Senator, and it was in this
ease on behalf of the Senator and his aide, it requires a
preliminary investigation or preliminary determination by the
court as to whether or not it appropriately applies, whether
legitimate legislative activity is involved.

Once that has

been raised and there is —
QUESTION:

You say where speech or debate is in­

volved, it is a threshold issue because the Senator shouldn't
even be in court at all?
MR. RAYWID:

That is correct,

The court should

proceed no further when it makes such a determination.
QUESTION:

Shouldn't reach the local law issue at

all?
MR. RAYWID:

Should not reach the local law, should

not reach First Amendment.

It is an obligation on the part

of the court to first reach that examination.
QUESTION:

So under your hypothesis a court, say

the District Court here in Madison would have addressed first

27
speech or debate, then local law, then First Amendment?
MR. RAYWID:

That would be the appropriate order,

but in order to reach local law it might first have to deter­
mine First Amendment issues.
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

Why?
Well, certainly if there is no libel

then It need not address First Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose a complaint In its terms

alleged only that the defamatory statements were made in a
speech on the floor of the House or the Senate on a given
day and then gave the content of that speech, would there be
anything in that case except speech or debate clause?
MR. RAYWID:

There would be nothing in that case,

Mr. Chief Justice, that would be a simple determination and
the —
QUESTION:

A demurrer type of response to it by the

Senator.
MR. RAYWID:

It would need no evidentiary showing

whatsoever, a demurrer type operation would be sufficient,
merely need to plead the speech or debate clause on the
avermenee in the complaint.
QUESTION:

On your approach on that hypothetical,

the Senator or Congressman may write a letter rather than
file a formal answer, saying on the face of the complaint
against me I am. not required to answer in any place other

28
than the Senate or the House itself, and that would suffice
in your view?
MR. RAYWID:

Perhans it might, but 1 would think

that the Senator would observe legal procedure like any other
litigant and raise that issue preliminarily.

But he might

choose not to answer at all, and it would then be incumbent
upon the court to examine that complaint and see whether or
not it was immune.
1 have been describing an annual ritual of some
rather major proportions in the Congress.

I want to emphasize

that that is the principal business of the Congress and takes
up most of its legislative year.
Now, turning to Senator Proxmire, Senator Proxmire
is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and he
serves on five of its subcommittees.

Those five subcommittees

have control or at least pass upon 60 percent of the national
budget.

They pass on 75 percent —
QUESTION:

Mr. Raywid, as I understood your brief,

you make precisely the same argument if Senator Proxmire was
not a member of any of these committees, is that right?
MR. RAYWID:
this right.

That is correct, that any member has

But it is certainly more particularized in his

responsibilities, and if there is to be any examination made
of his -QUESTION:

Presumably every Senator has an interest

P.9
in avoiding waste of government funds, so I don’t understand
what the committee membership has to do with the case.
MR. RAYWID:

The committee membership was one of

the findings below, it certainly explains if any examination
is to be made of Senator Proxmire.

But I agree with you, Mr.

Justice Stevens, that that right rests in all Congressmen and
it is one that the Congress protects.
In addition to these committee assignments though, I
would like to mention one additional assignment he has.

All

of these subcommittee assignments span the particular agencies
which received the Fleece.

But in addition to that, he has

an assignment on the Joint Economic Committee and he is
Chairman of Its Priorities and Economy in Government.

That

committee curiously may not pronose any legislation.

It has

purely an Informational function.

It publishes a number of

reports, but its most popular one is its nontly Economic
Indicators.

It is itfidely circulated and, as I say, has an

informative function only.
Senator Proxmire has been In the Senate for 21 years.
It has been a hallmark of his representation that he has
always criticized waste and government inefficiency.

After 16

years in Congress, he made the decision that he could be
much more effective in that criticism if he narrowed his focus
and made some particular or dramatic representation of waste
in government.

Billions have no relation or have no sense to

30

the public as a whole or even for that matter to economists.
But some particular Item that the government ha*? pair1, twice
the amount of its retail value does have a lot of meaning.
He has chosen a pattern of making a speech and
also issuing a simultaneous press release for the widest
possible coverage.

He has explained in his deposition the

reason why he does this, is that debate and speaking on the
floor is not a debating process in the modern Congress.
Senators do not attend speech and debates, they do not read
the Congressional Record or they are not apt to generally,
but they do read the newspapers about what has occurred in
Congress, and they do listen to their constituents about
what their constituents are concerned about in Congress.

It

is in that manner that he feels he can be most effective in
his criticism of spending.
Now, these have been characterized as defamatory
or m.iseharaeter ized I believe as defamatory, but before we
reach that issue I would like to show how each of these ---■

He certainly could in his speech on the

MR. RAYWID:

Without question.
What if he made a commencement speech at

the University of Michigan where Dr. Hutchinson was employed
and said the same things?
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

Possibly yes, probably not.
Probably not

MR. RAYWID:

protected?

Probably not protected.

We draw a

distinction in this case and I think you, Mr. Chief Justice,
put your finger on or at least our element of the case, our
major emphasis, when you asked Mr. Cavanaugh whether he
would concede as to whether a publication authorized by the
Congress would-be protected.

He said in his view it would be.

It is our position that this particular release through newsletter and through press release is a matter specifically
authorized by Congress.
QUESTION:

Well, that is in general.

That is in

general, I take it, because Congressmen and Senators are
authorized to frank their communications to their constituents.
Is that what you mean?

I mean this particular release wasn’t

approved by Congress.
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID;
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

That is correct.
Or by any committee, for that matter.
That is not correct.
Why?
A procedure has been established in

32

1973 after this Court’s opinions in its 1971-72 session, a
procedure was established for mailings.
3210.

That is in 39 U.S.C.

The first thing that was placed in that statute was

first to express the intent of Congress.

It was the intent

of Congress to inform the public and that that was part of
its legislative process.

Then it said Congressmen may mail

certain items.
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

Right.
They may not mail political items,

they may not put in personal information.

Then it estab­

lished a procedure for complaints and it also established a
procedure for review.

As the petitioner has pointed out,

they don’t review them for the accuracy of the statements,
but —QUESTION:

What I am asking, was this particular

publication approved as it was written by a committee?
MR. RAYWID:

It was approved because it was mass

mailed, it was sent to the Senate service department for
approval as to whether it conforms to these statutory rules
that were enacted in 1973.

In that manner, we maintain that

this has been conduct that has been authoi^ized by Congress
and for that matter it is protected.
QUESTION:

Now, it would —

Do you think that matter is entirely in

the hands of Congress, that Congress could have passed the
statute saying that anything that a Congressman or a Senator

33
wants to mail anywhere at any time is protected, regardless of
how defamatory it is?
MR. RAYWXD:

That would be too braod.

What we do

maintain is that this Court should give due deference to
Congress in the way Congress operates, in the way Congress
says it operates.
its functions.

Congress understands best how to perform

The Court is willing and has frequently given

due deference to legislative schemes that the Congress estab­
lishes.

When the Congress itself defines how it is to operate,

vie say that a substantial amount of deference should be given
to Congress.

It may be some determination initially by this

Court in its authority to review all acts of Congress, even
its own functions as to whether —
QUESTION:

Do I understand you to suggest that

Congress by legislative enactment can broaden, expand the scope
of the speech or debate clause?
MR. RAYWID:

The speech or debate clause is broad

but Congress helped to define that and Congress helps to —
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

Who defines it finally?
Well, certainly this Court must pass on

the scope of speech or debate.

But in arguing due deference,

it seems to me that the Court should give wide latitude to
Congress in its explanation of its functions.

As I said, it

understands what Its obligations are best , and some review
process is necessary.

3;4

QUESTION:

But when you are talking about deference

basically, this Is a case that could have been for all prac­
tical purposes for the Issues here been brought in the state
court in Wisconsin, and so the ultimate question is whether
the state of Wisconsin in enforcing its libel policy or its
slander policy is foreclosed from enforcing it by the speech
and debate clause of the United States Constitution.

It

isn't a question of this Court giving due deference to the
Senate or the House.
MR. RAYWID:

Well, this Court, of course, is the

ultimate authority on defining legitimate legislative activity.
QUESTION:

It is up to us in this case to decide the

question that my Brother Rehnquist accurately I think says is
posed by this case.
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Can the State of Wisconsin enforce its

policy expressed in its tort law in this diversity case in
defamation and slander cases in these circumstances, despite
the speech or debate clause, and that is a question that this
Court has to answer in this case.
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
But your submission is, I take it, that

the Senator may in his newsletter to his constituents tell
knowing and deliberate falsehoods about other people and be
immune, that even if this is the grossest kind of defamation

35
under Wisconsin or local law, that the Senator is immune from
distributing these statements in his newsletters, that is
your submission?
MR. RAYWID:

Certainly that is viewing it in its

harshest light, but I would agree.
QUESTION:

Yes, that is the basis on which we must

review the case, isn’t it?
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

Well, not entirely since the Court -Well, why isn’t it?
— since the Court has held that it

was not defamatory material, that could —
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

Who held that?
The District Court.
Well, that Is the end of the case then,

if we accept that., it shouldn't even be here.
QUESTION:

That wasn’t reviewed by the Seventh

Circuit ?
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

No, it was not.
So we must on the speech or debate issue

— you certainly can’t object to our viewing the case on the
basis that this is the grossest kind of defamation.
MR. RAYWID:

I would have to agree, and that is the

issue posed when speech or debate has been raised.
QUESTION:

I agree with.

And would you say the

Senator is Immune at the rostrum in his home district if he

36
gets out his newsletter and reads it?
MR. RAYW1D:

We would make a distinction between

what has been authorized by Congress, what ]is in the means and
how Congress has defined its particular function.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you say about the radio

and television broadcasts?
MR. RAYWID:

We have advocated to what is specific­

ally authorized a per se approach, that TV appearance was not
authorized by Congress.

In that instance, an ad hoe approach

might be necessary, a more thorough examination of the material
of that television broadcast.

Was the Congressman or was the

Senator in that program serving legitimate legislative needs?
QUESTION:

And Is It your position that it not be

determined by us — is it your position that that staff person
that this was handed to decides as to whether this is
congressional action or not?
MR. RAYWID:

MR. RAYWID:

Well, I —
Is that your position?
In a sense, yes.
Well, do you think Congress can give to

a person that is neither a Congressman or anything else that

MR. RAYWID:

That is correct, and they are employed

by the Rules Committee.

Then there are two other restraining

forces, it seems to me, and that is the Ethics Committee,
complaints may be referred to the Ethics Committee for
disciplinary action.

The statute that I referred to In 1973

establishes a whole procedure for due process and screening
of any material that may be defamatory.

So there is a self­

policing process and, of course, the major process with a
legislator is supposed to be, the major restraining force is
supposed to be the ballot box.
QUESTION:

So Dr. Hutchinson should have gone to

the committee, the Ethics Committee or some place in the
Senate to complain?
MR. RAYWID:

Yes, he could have done that, as could

any citizen.

mentioned due deference.

Vie have

In the investigations conducted by

Congress, this Court has seemed to have shown the greatest
amount of deference, even though that investigation might not
be specifically authorized by Congress.

Once an investiga­

tion has been determined that it is a matter upon xvhich
legislation may be had, this Court has said it will not

40

examine any further the conduct and that it is immune.

We

would say that the same principle ought to apply with respect
to the informing function.
QUESTION:

But hasn’t that generally been apnlied

to committee chairmen or committee activities, rather than
individual members of Congress?
MR. RAYWID:
say that it has been.

No, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, I would not
Most frequently it is exercised by

committee chairmen, but there has been no restraint on in­
vestigation by a particular member.

In the Gravel case, in

the investigation in that case, there was to be no investi­
gation or the court ruled there would be no further investi­
gation as to the motives of that member in preparing himself
for the committee hearing.
Now, also a distinctive feature in Gravel from
this case — and it has been relied upon by the netit loner —
is that conduct, that is, secret material was specifically
proscribed by Congress, both its collection and its distribu­
tion.

The distinction we believe that should be apparent In

this case is that this particular material has been generally
authorized by Congress and the newsletters and press releases
have been specifically facilitated —
QUESTION:

But you have already said that no one

checks the content, then how do you authorize the contents of
a letter which the Congress has carefully, very carefully,

you said they would not censor, was the term you used?
MR. RAYWID:
lar member.

It would not try to muzzle a particu­

That might be an abuse that this Court would

ask to be resolved in the member’s favor5, but it does attempt
to screen for facilitation or that the particular proscrip­
tions in the 1973 Act have not ,been violated.
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that Congress

could by legislative enactment authorize a libel, as I think
Mr. Justice White put it to you in different terms, extend
the speech or debate immunity to something which it does not
cover within the reach of that clause?
MR. RAYWID:

It may frequently and has in the past

concerned libel.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Raywid, what if Senator

Gravel’s newsletter had contained the so-called "secret in­
formation" referred to?
MR. RAYWID:

Then I expect uhe screening process

might have stopped its distribution.
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

But you said it doesn’t censor,
I said it screens for conformance with

its rules.
QUESTION:

Well, what if something in the newsletter

would violate Wisconsin law or local law?
MR. RAYWID:

So long as it serves the legitimate

legislative need and so long as Congress has made that

42
determination, it seems to me that due deference should be
made to that determination and immunity would follow and the
Wisconsin law would have to give way.
QUESTION:

So you think Congress did intend to

authorize Seators intheir newsletters, to give them immunity,
absolute immunity for the grossest kind of defamation, you
think that was their intention In this legislation?
MR. RAYWID:

It sought to protect their communica­

tion with their constituents —

be answered yes or no.
MR. RAYWID:
yes.

But there is broad definition there as that the matter

should relate to business before the Congress, to matters of
broad public interest, to only state Information where it
bears upon the impact of national legislation.
QUESTION:

What about the letters, the newsletters

that went outside of Wisconsin, Senators don’t have con­
stituents in the technical sense outside of their own states,
do they?
MR. RAYWID:

That is true.

However, each Senator,

of course, has their national impact and votes on national
issues.

The actual facts there and what Proxmire explained

was that he mails to his constituents, he also mails to those
persons who have requested to be placed on his mailing list.

»3
QUESTION:

That; may include quite a few newspapers,

for example, and radio and television broadcasters.
MR. RAYWID:

That determination is made entirely

separately, and those are the press releases.

They are broad­

ly distributed and are not confined to his state by any means.
The petitioner has properly represented that they went to
news media throughout the country.

Constituents are another

matter — the newsletters are another matter and they are not
sent as a matter of routine to the press or the media.
There has been reliance placed on Story’s interpretation of the Constitution and his early pronouncements as
to whether or not speech or debate Immunity would cover republi­
cation.
On the very issue that you raised, Mr. Chief Justice,
Story has an extended comment.

I don’t know whether we read

different editions, but in the Fifth Edition, in section. 866
and there is an extended footnote in which he says that
Congress may have an immunity when they write to their con­
stituents, report to their constituents, and he treats the
very issue that you raised, that constituency should not be
confined to his particular state, he ought to be able to reach
and influence legislation beyond that state, and his immunity
is perhaps so far as he accurately reports and does not defame.
Now, Story goes on in the quote that has' been cited
in the reply brief, and then there is a caveat at the end of

44
his long examination of speech or debate which was not in­
cluded in that quote., and he says that there are legal scholars
that disagree on my interpretation of the English Law and make
a distinction in American Law that because the Congress has
mandated that all of its speeches and all of its proceedings,
unlike the English Law.or Parliament, be made public, then the
argument follows that speech or debate should follow a republi­
cation of official congressional business, whether it be from
speaking on the floor or whether it be publication or distribu­
tion by that Congressman of what he said on the floor.

QUESTION:

It wouldn’t be up to you, I suppose, to

MR. RAYWID:

Well, what we tried to point out in

the courts below, and successfully so, is that that issue was
not posed to the Brewster court, that that was not contained
in the Brewster case.

They were talking about bribery.

It

might have been helpful in explaining the scope of legislative
immunity in that particular case.

We are not maintaining for

unlawful conduct here or any activity proscribed by the
Congress itself should speech or debate immunity apply.

Criminal conduct.

conduct, you meant criminal conduct, did you?

But also in the Doe case, when

the Court was considering whether it was necessary to make a
legitimate legislative need,in order to meet the Brewster
language we made an elaborate evidentiary showing, rather

49
than the mere halting of immunity by simply the letter, as
the Chief Justice suggested might be filed.

We made an ex­

tensive evidentiary showing to try and explain how Congress
operates, how Congress conceives its own function, and in
that manner hope to overcome that dicta and show that this
was necessary to a legitimate legislative function.
QUESTION:

The statements in the Court's opinion in

the Brewster case are clear and unambiguous, aren't they?
They are, as you suggest perhaps, dicta, that the Court
would certainly have to modify or amend those views, wouldn’t
they, if you are correct —

Well, the —

Well, we believe that a majority of

The Brewster majority turned out to be the

Doe minority and they were talking in the Doe minority of the
rights of Congress or the necessary function of Congress to
inform.

Vie think that seven members of this Court have

given more than adequate treatment to the informing function.

In Doe, the committee had authorized the

publication, had it not?

Yes, it had, and to that —

You can complete your

MR. RAYWID:

Well, I merely wanted to say, yes, and

to that extent we would say that in our per se application
that Doe should be extended.

It was only, of course, the

majority opinion there which was written by only two Justice
and joined by an additional three.

I think the critical

factor in Doe, the influential factor that, made up the
majority is that this was exposure for the shear sake of ex­
posure in violation of Watkins, and the Court was offended by
it.

In this particular case, It is so intimately tied to

public spending and how these agencies, and given to these
particular agencies and authorized by Congress, those are
distinguishing elements.

But to the extent that we are

contra to Doe, we would ask the Court to modify it.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that in order to ex­

plain unwise public expenditures that it is necessary to libel
someone in order to get attention?

Is that a justification

for the libel?
MR. RAYWID:

No.

But as Mr. Justice White said —

I believe I aim properly paraphrasing him —- that we may make
the assumption that it was libelous.

No, I wouldn’t say that

was necessary, but neither does the Court, it seems to me,
want to get into the examination of each — the exercise of
each Congressman, how he feels he will reach the public, how
he will influence legislation, how he will garner votes.
it is, it will be havoc.

It will be placing the legislature

51
under the heel of the judiciary, and it will remove to a sub­
stant.ial degree the representation of Congress.
QUESTION:

You say of the judiciary.

Basically it

is a question of Wisconsin tort law unless the Constitution
prohibits it.

It isn’t certainly up to this Court to kind of

pull something out of the sky and say, yes, you can, and, no,
you can't.
MR. RAYWID:

Well, that issue may never come to

this Court, it is true, but I would put no less weight on a
possible hostile judiciary in the State of Wisconsin or any
other state as curbing the activity of a Congressman.
equally important

It is

it seems to remove that from all courts.

QUESTION:

Even for openly illegal activities?

MR. RAYWID:

Not for unlawful activity or activity

proscribed by Congress.
QUESTION:

But where it is authorized -—

Because of criminal libel law in a state

and this publication, anybody within his right mind would
think it is criminal libel.
MR. RAYWID:

You say he is immune?

Yes, I would say he is immune.

It

sounds very much like sedition la tvs.
QUESTION:
MR. RAYWID:

The law of libel sounds like sedition —
It would be criminal to prosecute a

Congressman in issuing a letter in the manner proscribed by
Congress and make that subject to a criminal libel law, yes,
it seems to me akin to a sedition law.

52
QUESTION:

Well, sedition I thought was criticism

of the government.
MR. RAYWID:

Yes, and I have stated in every one of

these instances where the conduct under review here is con­
duct of criticism of the government.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose a Senator goes back to his

home state and says the guy who lives next to me in Madison
is a real s.o.b.
MR. RAYWID:

He should bring an action against that

Congressman and he should be prosecuted in those local courts,
without question.
QUESTION:

So your doctrine would not extend that

far?
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

It certainly would not.
That isn't sedition?

MR. RAYWID:

No, that is not sedition, the same as

if he ran over someone.
QUESTION:

Do you rely — I would like to ask this

question, I perhaps have been too deferential — do you rely
a grea,t deal in your brief on what you call the informing
function of Congress to justify bringing the newsletters and
press releases within the speech or debate clause?

That

function xfhich was exercised by Woodrow Wilson and has been
by many, many others, I had always understood to be largely
the function of Congress to inform itself in order to

53
intelligently legislate.

You rather understand it as a func­

tion of informing the public.
MR. RAYWID:

I don't believe or certainly not my

reading, Mr. Justice Stewart, of all of those treatises as
narrowed to Congress.
QUESTION:

It seems to me the nature of —
You mean the justification for congres­

sional invest 3-gat ions by its various committees and subcom­
mittees, the basic justification is the Informing of the
♦

members of Congress so that they can act intelligently in
deciding whether or not to vote for or against proposed legis­
lation or even in framing the proposed legislation.
MR. RAYWID:

I think Mr. Justice Blackmun has best

articulated our position on the informing function in his
dissent in Doe.

He characterizes that informing function in

four different stages.

He talks about the public, getting

word back from the public, and the participation of the
public

with their Congressman and how that influences

legislation.

I would say —

QUESTION:

With all respect to my Brother Blackmun,

that was a dissenting opinion, correct?
MR. RAYWID:

It was a dissenting opinion, but as I

have tried to point out, it seems to me that a number of
dissenters in the varying opinions of the Court have been
very much conscious of the informing function and they would
make up ■— or which I Invite a. new majority in recognizing

54
the informing function —
QUESTION:

The informing of the public, not the in­

forming of the members of Congress.
MR. RAYWID:
QUESTION:

Most definitely.
It is both, at least,

you would concede

that, wouldn’t you?
MR. RAYWID:

Oh, certainly.

Other members play a

definite part and that wa3 what Senator Proxmire said was im­
portant.
QUESTION:

I read Woodroiv Wilson’s essays as putting

the emphasis on informing and. educating the public, but that
was a function of the Congress through its committees, not
100 individual Senators and 435 individual Congressmen running
off on their own as having any immunity.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. CAVANAUGH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER—REBUTTAL
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honors, Mr. Raywid just corn™

mented that this case does not involve a case of exposure for
the sake of exposure.

We would vigorously disagree with that.

That appears to us to be exactly what occurred here.

Senator

Proxmire's avowed purpose was to award the Golden Fleece to
funding agencies for the funding that they had granted.
was no need to name Dr. Hutchinson by name.
to ridicule and humiliate Dr. Hutchinson.

There

There was no need
There was no need

to send this press release in addition to every newspaper and
member of the media in the United States, to members of the
press in Japan, Italy, Britain, and Canada.
A Senator*s press releases may be entertaining to
read and they may be entertaining on television talk shows,
but to the people in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to the victims in
Madison, Wisconsin, and the victims in the other places in
the United States, they are devastating, they humiliate, they
ridicule and they emotionally cripple.
What can a man who has been a victim of one of these

56
releases say to his children when he comes home?
his children tell their school mates?

What can

The Court has always

attempted to balance the interests of the Individual and his
reputation.
QUESTION:

Well, you can tell them who to vote for *

I guess.
(Laughter)
QUESTION:

In Michigan, they don’t allow citizens

to vote in other states, do they?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That’s right, nor do they do to thos

unfortunate people in Japan who receive these newsletters or
the press releases.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t the real damage that you are

talking about in the academic community and his professional
reputation as a scientist either within the country or out of
the country, who has a wide enough reputation?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That certainly is a major element,

but there is also damage just to the people who know Dr.
Hutchinson as a person.

In fact, a press release like this

calls a man a charlitan or a fraud, accuses him of taking
government money for doing worthless work.

You could take

the same approach and describe a scientist discovering
penicillin as some charlitan taking money to watch bread mold.
It is simply unfair and what the Senator is asking us to do
in this case is to totally disregard the balancing process

that has occurred in the past and to grant Senators absolute
immunity for anything they say at any time, in any place, no
matter how widely it is disseminated.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cavanaugh, in your principal arp^u-

ment, I asked you about the public figure issue and you helped
me out there.

What about the public official problem which

the court below did not reach?

Wasn't your client a public

official, has that term been used in the case or not?
MR. CAVANAUGH;
is.

No. Your Honor, I don’t believe ho

A public official has already been defined as a person

who occupies a high public position who would be the subject
of interest without the controversy.

In this case, Dr.

Hutchinson was the Director of Research of Kalamazoo State
Hospital. He had ten or eleven employees under his super­
vision.

He could not hire, he could not fire.

little discretion.

He had very

He could respond to a contract request

from a federal agency, but he would respond through his
employing department.

He was no different in the type of

position that he had, really, than someone who was director
of nursing at an institution or director of physical facili­
ties.

He is not the type of public official that I think the

Court had in mind In the eases where public officialis spoken
of.

He was not an elected official.
QUESTION:

Could you measure it by the number of

persons under his supervision, is that the test, or Is it the

58
Importance of his responsibilities?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
is any one test.

Your Honor, I don't think that there

The number of people under him is a measure

of his responsibility.

If responsibility is the test, Dr.

Hutchinson had no authority to spend the money that Senator
Proxmire has referred to.

It was sent to the State of

Michigan and the most that Dr. Hutchinson could do was to
submit a purchase request or a voucher for payment of salar­
ies.

The people who controlled the funding were the funding

agencies in Washington and then the agencies in Michigan that
received the funds.

Dr. Hutchinson was merely another civil

service employee.
QUESTION:

He was an officer of the state, wasn't

he?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

An officer of the state, sir?

Usually they are.

Professors are

usually officers of the state.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

He was an employee of the state.

Your Honors —
QUESTION:

How does a Senator or a. Congressman who

is focusing on some particular problem, how do you say he
should inform his constituents or the broad constituency,
which is the country?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
defaming.

Your Honor, he can Inform without

He should not need absolute immunity to say the

59
boldest lie.

It should be enough that he can tell the truth

to his constituents or the other members of the nation.

He

certainly can say anything to other Congressmen and have
absolute Immunity.
QUESTION:

Well, if he issued a press release, even

a great many of them, simply stating all of these facts that
"X" hundreds of thousands of dollars were being spent and
reciting factually and accurately the nature of the research,
how many members of the media would pay any attention to if?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

It would be pretty dull stuff, wouldn't

It?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

It is difficult to say how many

members of the media pay attention to one of his Golden
Fleeces two weeks after it is issued.

It is certainly sensa­

tional when it Is issued, and it gets coverage simply because
it is sensational because of the witty things that it says.
But, Your Honor, I am not sure that that ultimately is given
any more attention than would a factual truthworthy or truth­
ful newsletter or press release.
QUESTION:

What do you say about the protection of

a Senator from having to go before a court on the Island of
Maui in the Hawaiian Islands and defend a statement that he
made?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, If he makes a statement.

50

it is his obligation to defend it.
QUESTION:

To go to Maui and defend it?

MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, I would disagree with

Mr. Raywid's statement that he does not even have to file an
answer.

I believe the law is that the Senator does have to

file an answer.

He could raise speech and debate then if

It Is legitimate activity and he certainly could ask to have
the case moved to some other forum.

But if the Senator makes

a defamatory statement and broadcasts is to widely that it
reaches Hawaii, then I don't think it is unfair to Initially
require him to appear or throup^h counsel to defend it.
QUESTION:

If it is within the clause, the clause

says he may not be questioned.

That literally means they

can't even ask him a question on a deposition, on the witness
stand in the court room, or anywhere else.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

If it is within the privilege, yes,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Congress could forbid any federal court

from taking jurisdiction over a claim such as this against a
member of Congress, could it not?
MR, CAVANAUGH-

Your Honor, I don't believe Congress

could because if you said that Congress could do that, then
you are saying that Congress has the power to rewrite the
Constitution* and the Congress has the power to say how broad
the protection is afforded by the speech or debate clause.

Cl
QUESTION":

They are not rewriting the Constitution.

They are simply saying that courts which they create, lower
federal courts shall not entertain particular types of
actions.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Then, Your Honor. I assume our

cause of action would be in a higher court, perhaps in front
of this Court as an original action.
QUESTION:

Under Article III Congress lias the power

to create any inferior federal courts that it wants to and
to allocate to them any jurisdiction it wants to, that is all
that my Brother Rehnquist is talking about.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

But I don't think that that would

deprive the victim of his right to appear in some court,
perhaps state court or perhaps a higher federal court that
Congress has not created.
QUESTION:

They surely would have no jurisdiction

under Article III, any power under Article III to decline
state court jurisdiction.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That's right. Your Honor.

That is

absolutely correct.
QUESTION:

And when a federal court sits on a state

case diversities, It is surrogate for a state court, is it
not?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Congress could repeal diversity

62

jurisdiction tomorrow.
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Congress has been urged to do it.

(Laughter)
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, we would respectfully

ask that the Court reverse the lower decisions and permit Dr.
Hutchinson to have his day in court so that he may vindicate
his reputation.
QUESTION:

Is a newspaper publishing a quote from

the Congressional Record liable to the victim?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

No, Your Honor, generally there is

a privilege for the media to -QUESTION:

So if the media takes the Congressional

Record in which this Golden Fleece Award has been placed and
publishes it in full, it is immune?
MR. CAVANAUGH:
QUESTION:

It would be, Your Honor.

The Senator, though, if he mails it in

in his newsletter, the very same thing, a copy of the
Congressional Record, you say he is not immune?
MR. CAVANAUGH:

That is correct. Your Honor.

are two separate immunities.

There

The Senator’s immunity is under

the speech and debate clause, the press’s immunity is the
common law that has been developed and. the common lav; has
revognized a qualified privilege for members of the media to
accurately report what has taken place in Congress or in a

But there are two separate immunities.

With the

Senators I think under Doe if he publicises the action taken
or the speech made wider than is necessary for legitimate
legislative need* he has exceeded the speech or debate clause
and there is liability.
QUESTION:

The submission is, though, that newsletters

are an ordinarily way of legislating.
MR. CAVANAUGH:

Your Honor, we would respectfully

disagree with that, that a newsletter to 100,000 people in
Wisconsin and outside of Wisconsin is not within the legitimate
legislative needs of Congress.

It is a personal political act.

Thank you very much.
