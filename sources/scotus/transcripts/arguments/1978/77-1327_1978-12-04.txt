MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

He will hear arguments

first this morning in'77”1327# Lake Country Estates against
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.
Mr, Bartko, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BARTKO, ESQ.,
ON BEHA LF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, BARTKO:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
My argument will focus on the questions of whether
there should be a per se rule according all compact created
agencies the status of states for the purpose of the Eleventh
Amendment* without regard to their purpose* financing* function
or the relationship of the agency to the states.

As subsidiary

issues thereunder, whether under appropriate agencies,; under
appropriate standards, the compact agency before the Court
should be treated as a state, and further whether the provisions
of this compact have waived any claim of immunity.
Also, my argument will focus on the question of
whether or not the claims asserted under 42 U.S.C., Section
1933.* are such that the Eleventh Amendment may be raised as a
bar.
In addition to the Eleventh Amendment issues, the
Petitioner raises the question of whether or not the members,
of the governing body of this agency should be accorded the

4
absolute immunity which is accorded to Members of Congress and
members of state legislatures.
QUESTION:

r

You are not going to argue, then, Counsel,

the merits of your — what I would call the merits of your Claim
against the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency?
MR* BARTKQ:

If. Your Honor is referring to the

Bivens issues?
QUESTION:

No, I meant the claim that there was a

taking or something of that sort.
MR„ BARTKQ:
so.

No, Your Honor, 1 do not intend to do

This case is before you after a motion to dismiss on the

pleadings.
The Court of Appeals concluded that the Petitioners
were entitled to predicate a claim based upon violation of their
Fifth Amendment rights that their property should be not taken
from them without just compensation and due process of law.
Respondents have attacked this conclusion in their briefs,
Inasmuch as no cross-petition was filed in this Court
and such an attack would not sustain the position of the court
below, we do not believe that that issue is. properly before
this Court.

I am prepared to address it if the Court wishes me

to do so, howevero
Some background information is useful for purposes
of placing these Issues, in perspective,

The compact agency with

which we deal is known as the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.

5
It is the product of an agreement between the States of California
and Nevada, whereby they created a regional agency with the power
to regulate and control land-use development and certain environ­
mental factors in the Lake Tahoe Basin.

Congress gave its con­

sent to the compact in December of 1969 <>
The agency is controlled by a governing board consis­
ting of ten members* none of whom are elected.

The TRPA was

charged by the compact with adopting a regional land-use plan
and ordinances* rules and policies to effectuate that plan.
Its jurisdiction* as I have said* is limited to the Lake Tahoe
Basin.
Petitioners, are owners of land in the Tahoe Basin.
A master plan had been approved by .local governmental authorities
for the development of their land.

Subsequent thereto, the TRPA

enacted its plan and classified virtually all of Petitioners'
property into a category known as "General Forest."

The per­

mitted uses in that category were largely recreational, hiking,
pic'n icing, stables, timber growing, livestock raising.

A small

portion of Petitioners11 land was classified into a category
known as "Conservation Reserve."

The permitted uses in that

classification were’ the same until such time as this holding,
zone were permitted for other uses.
The Petitioners' filed suit contending that their
land was not suitable for any of the permitted uses.

XLe

6
complaint alleged a taking without just compensation and a denial
of due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well
as claims under similar provisions in the State Constitutions of
both Nevada and California„

It sought declaratory, injunctive

and monetary relief against the agency itself, the Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency, members of its governing body and its Executive
Director»

It also sought relief against several counties who

are members of the compact*
This case is, as I noted before you in the pleadings —
the District Court having granted a motion to dismiss, it con»
eluded that if Petitioners were successful in proving that the
agency had taken their land without just compensation, such an
act would have been beyond the scope of the agency's authority,
since it had not been granted condemnation powers, and, as such
would-have been ultra vires, and therefore —
QUESTION:

But if the powers exercised are equated

to something like zoning authority, then it is another matter,
isn't it?
MR. BARTKO;

Well, in this Court's decision of last

term considering the ordinances of the City of New York, I think,
the Court has concluded that zoning, in and of itself, imposes
regulatory uses which, if consistent with a due public purpose,
can be appropriate, but there are outer

limits to even zoning

powers.
In this particular instance, there are both zoning

7
regulations and classification of the land into permitted uses.
We believe that the complaint which is before the Court presents
the clearest of questions.
QUESTION:

Presents what?

MR. BARTKQ:

Presents the clearest of questions,,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKQ:

In what respect?
The complaint alleges that in this

particular instance the land is so ill-suited to the classifi­
cation it was put into that all value has been taken from it.
Rather than being —
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKQ:
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKQ:

So that it is a taking?
Yes # Your Honor.
A Fifth Amendment taking.
In addition, the District Court found

that the individual members of the Tahoe governing body were
protected in their discretionary acts with absolute immunity.
This case was consolidated with others in the Court
of Appeals.

The Court of Appeals ruled in its Initial decision

that the Petitioners had stated the claim# under the Fifth
Amendment Due Process Clause# against the Tahoe Regional
Planning Agency and against th© individuals for injunctive and
mandatory and declaratory relief.
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKQ:

Because it was a taking?
Yes# that is the basis of their claim#

8
that it was a taking involving a violation of the Due Process
portion of the Fifth Amendment,

The Court reasoned that, be­

cause Congress had given its consent to the compact, the compact
had been transformed from two separate state laws into Federal
law, for purposes of interpretation, and ruled that the claim
was based on the Fifth, rather than the Fourteenth Amendment,
because it had become Federal law,
QUESTION:

Well, just because Federal law might govern,

wouldn't make it a Federal action»

Was the claim that this

agency was a Federal agency -- action by the Federal Government,
a taking by the Federal Government?
MR» BARTKO:

No, the claim was under both the Fifth

and the Fourteenth Amendments#
Our position in the courts below and here has been
that this ~”
QUESTION:

Was the submission that if Federal law

governed it would be a Fifth Amendment question?
MR» BARTKO:

The submission was that the act here

constituted a violation of the guaranteed rights under the
Constitution, that is to say, violations of the Fifth Amendment
rights»
QUESTION:
MR» BARTKO:

By whom?
By an agency which was not entitled to

the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, an agency, for these
purposes, which may be sui generis,.

9
QUESTION:

But the Fifth Amendment protects only

against Federal action, does it not?
MR, BARTKO:

Yes, but the Fourteenth would protect

against an action by this agency ~~
QUESTION:
under the Fifth.

But I was asking you what the claim was

Why was there a claim at all under the Fifth?

MR, BARTKO:

Because the Petitioners were, .tinswe-as to

whether the claim should be under the Fifth or the Fourteenth
Amendment, because of uncertainty ae to whether or not the
Congressional consent would transform it,
QUESTION:

While you are stopped here ~~ The State of

California has power of eminent domain, I take it.
MRo BARTKO:
QUE5TI0N:
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:

It does.
And the State of Nevada has?
It does.
Could California have taken the action

taken here, with respect to the land lying within its borders,
under the power of eminent domain?
MR, BARTKO:

It could, but in this particular instance

both states created an agency which they did not empower to
exercise eminent domain.
QUESTION:

They didn't purport to take it under the

power, of eminent domain.

The agency did not purport to take it

under that power, did it?
MR, BARTKO:

That's correct.

It did not have that

10

power under either empowering statute,
QUESTION:

Would each of those two member states of

the compact have authority to exercise police power, by way of
zoning and land use?
MR. BARTKO:

They would have such authority, but it '

is not traditional in either California or Nevada for statas to
exercise such zoning and regulatory power; rather, it is more
traditional for a local government bodies*.such as

Gitie.- and counties, to exercise those powers*
In this instance, the two constituent states created
an agency with such powers, but without statutory power to
effect a condemnation by eminent domain.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bartko, if I could, back up a minute.

You said that when you filed this suit you didn't know whether
this agency was federal or state.
up your mind yet?

Have you made

It has to be decided, doesn't it?

MR. BARTKO:
be decided.

What is it?

I don't believe that it does have to

I believe that this agency is not entitled to

Eleventh Amendment protection, and that although it may be, as
a constituent portion of the state,a political subdivision.
And, therefore, the question of whether or not it is federal
or state need not be decided, although the teachings of this
Court suggest that interpretation of the compact is, in fact,
a federal question.
The only issue before the Court now is the issue of

11

Eleventh Amendment immunity of the agency.

And since all eon»

stituent bodies of the state are not entitled to Eleventh
Amendment, the question need not be reached.
If this agency is more like a county or a city than
more like a state, than the Eleventh Amendment would not protect
it.
QUESTION:

But then it would have zoning powers,

would it?
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKO:

Yes, it would, and in all fairness —
And land-use powers.
Yes, and in all fairness the provisions

of this compact do, in fact, charge the agency with land-use
regulation —
QUESTION:

That was one of the purposes of creating

it, wasn't it?
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKO:

Yes, it was,
But it wouldn't have powers of condemnation?
No, It would not.
Or of taking?
It would not and should not have under

fclies e c 1 rc urns tanc es.
QUESTION:

In your inverse condemnation suits in the

federal law, isn't the general requirement that unless Congress
has authorized condemnation your remedy is to enjoin the federal
official who has gone on the property and the fact of the taking,

12

ra ther t ha n fc ry t o g e t cl ama ges?
MR, BARTKO:

Vie have, in fact, included such claims

in this complaint.
QUESTION:

For an injunction?

MR a BARTKO:

We have included claims against the

officers for an injunction and for declaratory relief, that
their actions are beyond their powers.

But the issue still

remains what is to happen to the Petitioner in the interim
period, while he is contesting the validity of the agency in
taking the actions it has taken?

If, in fact, the agency has

taken acts which are beyond its powers, and all Petitioners'
remedy will be is to tell them that they have stepped beyond
their power, then the attention of the courts, will only be in
pruning back regulation beyond the authority of the agency, and
they will have, in effect, a lease on Petitioners’ land while
these questions are adjudicated.
We believe that those claims for interim relief from
monetary damages are appropriate under the Fifth Amendment's
just compensation provision.
QUESTION:

Would you think you would be entitled to

damages if there is no immunity, simply from the fact that your
use of it has been suspended for a period of time?
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:
here, have you?

I would believe that would be appropriate.
You haven’t sought that kind of damage

13

MR, BARTKO:

We have a general claim for damages,

It

is not limited in nature to interim relief, as opposed to the
ultimate value of the land.

Our claims in this case are that

if, in fact, there was a total taking,then the agency may be
responsible for the full value of the land.

If, in fact., they

did not intend to take the land, they are only responsible for
monetary relief for the interim period in which Petitioner hasbeen denied the use of his land while he seeks a remedy In the
courts to enjoin the agency from doing so further»
QUESTION:

Would that period cease as of the date

an injunction was issued in your favor?
MR* BARTKO:

I believe it would.

The Court of Appeals granted a petition for rehearing
and ruled, sui sponte, that although it had earlier decided that
the TRPA was liable under Bivens1principle, it was entitled to
Eleventh Amendment protection*

The decision of the Court of

Appeals was premised upon its reading of this Court's decision
in Petty v. Tennessee-Missourl Bridge Commission, at.359 U.S.
The Court of Appeals believed that that decision held that all
compact agencies are the same as the states for Eleventh Amend­
ment purposes.
We believe a careful reading of that opinion will show
that the author, Mr* Justice Douglas, in fact, assumed arguendo
for the purposes of that decision that the agency was, in fact,
so protected by the Eleventh Amendment.

In fact, the majority

14

decision phrases the question as being one of whether or not
there was a waiver, assuming arguendo that the entity was en­
titled to the protection.

And three of the concurring justices

concurred on the express stipulation that the Court had not
reached the constitutional question of whether or not the agency
was, in fact, entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection.
QUESTION:

How would a waiver be relevant if there was

nothing to waive, in the Petty case?
MR,, BARTKO:

As a matter of analysis, it might not be

relevant, Your Honor, but it was a way of sidestepping a more
difficult question.

And, since the waiver appeared so clear

to the Court in that case, it is my view that the opinion did
so in an appropriate fashion.
QUESTION:

Well, on your,interpretation, isn't that

somewhat like assuming without deciding that a court has jurisdiction -- the court goes on to decide the case?
decision on that assumption

Isn't a

that arguendo assumption

about

jurisdiction, a: decision on the merits on the decision on juris­
diction?
MR* BARTKO:

No.

X believe the court always had

jurisdiction to interpret the meaning of the compact, and the
Petty case makes that clear.

The issue was not one of juris­

diction, because the court had that jurisdiction to interpret
its meaning.

The issue was whether or not the court would also

confront the question of whether all compact agencies, because

15
they are created with the consent of Congress, are states for
the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment immunity.
Now, we know from the teachings of this Court, and
particularly its decision in Mfc. Healthy v. Doyle, at 429 U.S.
reports that not all portions of a state, not all subdivisions
of a state are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.

In that

case, the- Court decided that a school board was not an arm of
the state, but was more like a separate political subdivision,
and, as a consequence, was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment
immunity.
We urge that the same view is appropriate when dealing
with a compact created entity.

The purpose of the compact

clause End Congress' expressed consent to the entry of states
into compacts, was to protect the national interest to allow
Congress to allow which compacts should, in fact, be entered
into, not to transform all agreements between states into the
states themselves.
If, in fact, all compact created entities are states,
for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, it raises the question
of whether or not a controversy between one of the creating
states and the entity, as such, that it can only be brought in
this Court under its original and exclusive jurisdiction.
No discernible reason has been advanced for singling
out compact agencies from, other political subdivisions of states
for special protection.

The arguments advanced by Respondents

16

that, in fact,, states would be unlikely to enter into compacts
if, by doing so. they consented to federal jurisdiction, misses
the point that under the Petty decision this Court is always the
final arbiter of the meaning of the compact.

It also overlooks

the fact that compacts can be created like this one which ex­
pressly limit the responsibility of the constituent states and
the power of the compact-created agencies.
In addition, we would urge the Court to look to the
intent of the parties in the creation of this compact.
after ail, a contract between two states.

It is,

Both the States or

California and Nevada have argued in their briefs that the Tahoe
Regional Planning Agency was not intended to have the Eleventh
Amendment immunity of the states.
In the addition to the arguments urged before the
Court in my briefs, the provisions of the compact itself in­
dicate the intent ,of the creating states that this particularagency not be entitled to assert their Eleventh Amendment
immunity.
Articles of the compact refer to the entity as a
"political subdivision."

We know from the Mt. Hea 11hy decis 1 on

that political subdivisions, if they are not compact-created
entities, are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection.
A portion of the compact refers to jurisdiction in
the federal courts.

The jurisdiction of this particular agency

The authority to make rules is not limited by the

QUESTION:
a state function."

Wait a minute now.

You say "traditionally

In neither of these states* California or

Nevada., may they condemn land for state highways?
MR. BARTKO:

In both states* I believe* the states

have and do,, in fact* exercise the power of condemnation of land
for highways.
QUESTION:

I thought you said they did not have the

power?
MR. BARTKO:

What I meant to say was that zoning and

land-use regulation is* in fact* ordinarily a local function -QUESTION:
MR. BARTKO:

As distinguished from taking?
Yes* Your Honor.

Both the states have urged before this Court that they
have no control over the compact agency which they have created.
They have no veto power.

The majority of the members of this

compact agency and its governing body are appointed by local
agencies* not by the governor of the respective state,

six of

the ten members are* in fact* appointed by local counties and
cities.

As a consequence* the states do not control the agency

which they have created* and by stark contrast to the agencies
considered by the Eighth Circuit in getty and by the Second
Circuit in Trofcman, this lack of control by the constituent

18
states shows that the compact has not created an arm of the
states entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, but —»
QUESTION:

What would you do about a home rule city

that under a state constitution has powers that can't be
reached by the legislature?
MR* BARTKO:

A home rule city in my own State of

California is, in fact, a separate political subdivision and
/

would not be entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.
QUESTION:

So, you would make the same argument with

respect to them?
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:
MR. BARTKO:
Excuse me.

I would.
You would say it. is just like a state?
No, I would say it is because «*I misapprehended the Court's question.

Control is an important factor in making a decision.
In this particular instance, neither state has control.

There

may be instances ~~
QUESTION:

Well, what about a home rule city then,

does it have Eleventh Amendment protection, or doesn't it?
MR. BARTKO:

I believe a home rule city, if the state

does not have control over it, should not have Eleventh Amend­
ment protection.
All of these provisions in the compact indicate the
considered intent of contracting parties that the TRPA b©
a separate organ from state government.

lack of control is an

19

important factor in making such a judgment.
In addition, we believe the provisions of this
compact, if there were in fact Eleventh Amendment immunity,
have waived that immunity.

We know that there can be such a

waiver by this Court's decision in Petty.

We know by the

Court's decision in Bdelman v. Jordan that such waivers should
not be taken lightly.
However, this compact has two interesting provisions
which we believe are analogous to those in Petty.

It refers,

in the compact language at Section,6(b) to jurisdiction in the
federal courts.

It states as follows:

"Each such action shall

be brought in a court of the state where the violation is com­
mitted or where the property affected by a civil action is
situated, unless the action is brought in a federal court.
For this purpose, the agency shall be deemed a political sub­
division of both the State of California and the State of
Nevada."

It refers expressly to federal court jurisdiction.
In addition, the congressional consent which was also

relied upon by the Court in Petty is, in our view, equally as
broad.

It provides that nothing in the compact should in any

way affect the powers, rights or obligations of the United
States where the applicability of any law or regulation of the
United States in, over or to the region.
4
%

The only distinguishing factor in the consent pro­
vision in the Petty case was specific reference to the courts

20

of the United States.

We believe that this provision is even

more encompassing, because it refers to all of the rights,
powers, and obligations of the United States *
QUESTION:

May I interrupt just a minute.

Your brief

states that the states are not responsible for the debts of the
agency.

How is the agency financed?
MR. BARTKO:

The agency has the poxver to call upon

local counties for a fixed amount of funding In each fiscal
year.

As it presently stands, $150,000.

If the agency is to

receive additional funds, it must rely on the largess of the
constituent states or perhaps grants and subventions from other
agencies.
The compact also provides that the states shall not
be responsible for obligations created by the agency and limits
the power of the agency in that respect.
The other issue raised by the Petitioners is whether
or not the members of the governing body of this agency should
be entitled to absolute immunity.

The Court of Appeals ruled

that to the extent that members of the body might be acting, in
part, in a legislative function, they would be so entitled to
absolute immunity.
The teachings of this Court's decision indicate that
absolute immunity has heretofore in the legislative sphere only
been granted to Members of Congress and members of state legis­
latures, not to lower bodies

21

In the absence of the traditional safeguards which
were relied upon in this Court in the Butz decision last term,
to extend immunity to those acting in a judicial function, it
should not be done.
In this particular instance,, there are none of the
traditional safeguards which apply to an ordinary legislature.
The members of the governing body are not elected and called
upon to justify their acts periodically.

There is no established

practice or rules of discipline in this body that would, in fact,
allow the body to police itself and its members,
QUESTION:
MR, BARTKO:

Are the members appointed by the governors?
A portion of the members are.

governor has a right to appoint one member,

Each

There is also

another member from each state who serves by reason of his
classification as Director of Natural Resources in each state.
So, four of the ten members are, in fact, either appointed or
state officers,

The remaining six officers are designated, by

reason of their service on the local agencies, such as counties
and cities.
QUESTION:
MR, BARTKO:
QUESTION:

By whom?
By those local agencies.
Well, then, there is indirect public

responsibility in each case, isn't there, with respect to some
the governors and with respect to some, the local agencies?
MR„ BARTKO;

Yes, but I believe that it is too indirect,

22

Your Honor.

In this instance, they would be serving in two

functions and they would not be called upon at an election
with respect to vjhether or not they served as a good city
councilman, to also be responsible for their decisions as a
member of this compact agency, since it is a broader function,
QUESTION:

Mr, Barfcko, are you arguing the immunity

now?

whether there was a cause of action under the Fifth or the
Fourteenth, or both?

It would be over against the agency.
And we wouldn't have to consider some of

the questions you have been arguing.
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:

Yes. that is true.
Apparently, the Court of Appeals felt that

x^ay, too* or it wouldn't have reached the causa of action issue,,
ahead of immunity and ahead of the Eleventh Amendment juris­
dictional question.
MR. BARTKO:

Yes* but I believe the question really

that should be addressed is whether or not we have an appro­
priate record for this Court to determine such an important
question.

We corns before you on a motion —
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals thought it did and

it wouldn't expand the relief that the agency got before the
Court of Appeals.
MR. BARTKO:

The Court of Appeals did* in fact,

reduce the relief it granted against the agency.

It originally

24

had granted relief and then found that it could avoid that
question by finding that Eleventh Amendment immunity applied.
But what the Court would be doing by sidestepping the Eleventh
Amendment immunity question would, on a very sparse record in
ray view, be confronting a far more difficult question, that is
whether ~~
QUESTION:

Yes, but — Let's assume that we disagreed

with you —■ If we agree with you, then where do we go?

If we

agree with you and there is no Eleventh Amendment immunity,
where do we go then?
MR. BARTKO:

Then the case would be remanded to the

District Court for development of the facts in the record.
And, in fact, we would proceed forward on the claim based on
the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

You would argue that Respondents, then,

cannot have us review the cause of action relief?
MR. BARTKO:

I would so argue, because it would not

support the decision of the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, it would though, as far as the

agency is concerned.
MR. BARTKO:

It would as far as the agency, but that

goes to the agency and the agency alone.

It would not terminate

the case because our claims against the individuals would
survive for purposes of injunctive and mandatory relief.
QUESTION;

Well, at least the agency is entitled to

25

have the Court of Appeals affirmed on a separate ground* is it
not?
MR» BAKTKO:

The agency has made that claim and I

concede °~
QUESTION:

Entitled.

If we were to agree with all

of its contentions* as a matter of procedure»
We az>e not saying that they are right.

It is just a

question of whether we are entitled or whether even prudentially
we should reach the cause of action issue»
MR. BARTKO:

I believe that in fact the Court can*

under its prior decisions* extend itself to reach the cause-of
action, but it would be inappropriate on this record.
QUESTION:

What would be the relief against the

individuals in that circumstance?
MR. BARTKO;

The relief against the individuals would

be both injunctive and* in fact* monetary.

Monetary to the

extent that vie seek interim relief with regard to what has
happened to the property in the interim.
QUESTION:

What cause of action are you asserting

against »«= Is it a different cause of action against them?
MR. BARTKO:

No.

It is the same cause of action

agaInst the individuaIs„
QUESTION:

What if we ruled the Court of Appeals was

wrong on its cause of action
MR. BARTKO:

only?

It would go only to remedies to the

26

Individuals.

If they were with regard to the Bivens issue, in

fact, there would be no monetary relief available against the
individuals as well,,
QUESTION:

Or injunctive?

MR, BARTKO:
QUESTION:

I believe that the constitutional claims You still have to have a cans® of action to

get an injunction, I suppose,
MR. BARTKO:

Yes, we still have to have a cause of

action, but the Bivens claim and, in our view, the constitutional
claims for purposes of determining whether there has been a
taking or not, are different.
There has, in fact, been, with regard to the immunityquestion, a traditional reluctance to expand absolute immunity
because qualified immunity, in itself, is ordinarily sufficient.

MR. CHIEF JUS TIC E BURGER:

Mr. Rolls ton

ORAL ARGUMENT OP KENNETH C. ROLLS TON, ESQ „,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROLISTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to primarily address, In my portion of
the argument, the question of the appropriate remedy in this
case.
Initially, I think, a brief iteration of our view of
the facts is in order.

27

Zoning of this property is conservation reserve,
which zoning permits development in accordance with a specific
plan, a plan that is submitted — a master plan

detailing,

particularly on large parcels, the development which is desired
on that parcel.
The record of this case reveals that that specific plan
was solicited by the governing body of TRPA at the time this
property was zoned conservation reserve and that no such appli­
cation has been received.
1 believe it is also important to focus, down to the
fact that when we deal with appropriate remedies, as the issue
is framed before this Court:

Is monetary relief appropriate?

Principally we are talking about individuals.

Are those

individuals responsible,monetarily, for their legislative acts?
The specific individuals before this Court are the governing
body members of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,

Those in-

dividuals are sued for their specifically authorized act,
specifically authorized by the compact, of adopting a general
plan and a land-use ordinance.
It is not just that it is specifically authorized,
it is specifically required.

The qpmpact, in Article 5, tells

the governing body members, "Thou shalt adopt, a general plan."
In Article 6, the compact tells the governing body members,
"Thous shalt adopt a land-use ordinance."
So, we have not just authorized, we havve required

28
legislative acts.

Further, the compact,, specifically, in great

detail,specifies and constitutes the governing body.

It is not

left to mere choice.
QUESTION:

In Nevada or California, are members of a

zoning board, or any zoning body within the states, subject to
liability or are they immune?
MR. ROLLSTON:

They are absolutely immune, under the

law of both the State of California and the State of Nevada.
The pertinent authority is cited in my brief.
QUESTION:

Mr, Rollston, supposing that this compact

had authorized the regional planning authority to promulgate a
criminal code, and the individual members of the governing body
promulgated a code that said anyone caught shoplifting should be
taken out to the nearest tree and hung.

Do you think the fact

that the compact authorized the promulgation of a criminal code
would completely immunize the members?
MR. RGLXSTQN:
acts, yes.

Insofar as their undertaking legislative

I think it is important, in responding to your

question, to note that we are dealing with a very, very signifi­
cant difference when we talk about legislative acts, as compared

.
to executive acts. This Court had before it earlier this term
Bufcz v. Economou which Counsel for the Petitioners addressed.
When you talk about executive acts, you are talking about a
much more channelized area of responsibility.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't call the fellow who threw

29

the rope over the tree limb a legislator, would you?
MRo ROLLS TON:
QUESTION:

I certainly would not, Your Honor»

Apparently, there is conduct in this case

other than legislative?
MR» ROLLSTON:

The only question before this Court,

though, Your Honor, as framed by the Petitioner -- not the
only question

but the only question on this Issue, specific-

ally as framed by the Petitioner:
for legislative acts? Period»

Is 'there absolute immunity

nor Respondents has dealt with non-legislative acts»

The simple

tive acts, it seems to me, you are dealing with a much more

Certainly there is discretion, but you have

discretion within the law.

Principally, "Thou shalt enforce

There are no such parameters for legislators at all»
You have an area in which you may act, a broad area.

The wisdom

the collective wisdom of Whether that law is reasonable or neces
sary is up for the legislature to decide»
Further, an Executive official, unlike a legislator,
is much more subject and much more continuously subject to the
control and supervision of the Judiciary, unlike what is typical
of a legislator..
QUESTION:

Mr. Rollston, you mentioned earlier about

how carefully they spelled out all these requirements you put

30

on them of action they should take, and I think you said they
spelled it out in very great detail»

But they didn’t touch

immunity, did they?
MR» ROLLSTON:
QUESTION:

No, they did not, Your Honor.

Where do you get

immunity from, the state

immunity?
MR. ROLLS TON:

Well, I think, this Court in its
A

prior decisions, has recognized an absolute immunity for
legislative acts.

We can go to Tenney v. Brandhove, Doe v.

McMillan or the Gravel case.

In those cases, this Court mani­

festly was dealing with state and national legislators.

What

we are essentially asking is that —
QUESTION:

Are you saying that this is on the same

level as the Governor or the Legislature of Nevada?

This

Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, is that on the level of the
Governor or the .State Legislature?
MR» RQLL5TQN:
QUESTION:
there?

The State Legislature, Your Honor.

It is on the same level? How did It get

It is not elected,
MR. ROLLSTON:
QUESTION:

who is not elected.

No.
But it gets ars immunity, to an officer

He is appointed. I can’t just pick up

immunity likW that.
MR. ROLLSTON:

Weil, it depends on whether you are

examining immunity from the level of the act or of the task

31
performed.
Jn Bufez v. 35c on cm ou, this Court spoke of the level
of the act, or the fact that some of these Individual defendants
in that case were performing a judicial role.

They were not*

by any means -*»
QUESTION:

You are talking about another case now.

MR. RQLISTQN:

I am talking about another case# but

I think it depends principally on the type of act —
QUESTION:

VJhat can they do in the name of the state#

what can this Tahoe Regional Planning Agency do in the name of
the state?
MR. ROLLSTON:

It is dealing with problems that

neither state can solve singly in the area of land-use and
environmenta1 c ontroi.
QUESTION:

In the name of the state?

MR. ROLLSTON:
QUESTION:

Not in the name of the state# no.

Well# my question was:

What can they do

in the name of the state?
MR. ROLLSTON:

Not in the name of the state Itself.

It can do nothing.
QUESTION: Then your answer is nothing?
MR. ROLLSTON:
QUESTION:

Not in the name of the state.

How do you get immunity?

If you can't act

in the name of the state# how can you get state immunity?
MR. ROLLSTON:

Because it is performing a legislative

32

task on an interstate basis.
QUESTION:

Interstate?

MR0 ROUST ON:

That's a brand new immunity.

We are dealing with a unique entity»

the compact entity.
QUESTION:
compact immunity?

Is that a new immunity?

An interstate

Is that new?

MR0 RQLISTON:

Well» the number of compact cases that

there have been you could literally put in a very small hat
and it would sink.

There is not a lot of authority in that

area» in that specific area.
QUESTION:

That's why -»

Well» then this is new?

MR„ RQLISTON:

I don't believe it is new. Your Honor»

because we are talking about -QUESTION:

Can I assume that if you can't name it

it is new because you have researched it» haven't you?
MR. RQLL3TQN:

Well» I've also found a number of cases

which indicate -- cases of this Court and elsewhere

that

have indicated that when you deal with a legislative act immun­
ity is appropriate.
QUESTION:

I think —
Couldn't California» with respect to the

land west of the lake» have done for itself just what the agency
has done in terms of defining the land-use? Does it have the
legal authority to do it?
MR0 RQLISTON:
QUESTION:

Most certainly» Your Honor„

How about Nevada?

33
MR* ROLLS TON:
QUESTION:

Most certainly.

What if they had got together?

someone else could answer that.

Perhaps

What if informally each of them

had acted alone, but coordinated their objectives?

Then it

would be state action, I take it?
MR» ROLLS TON:

It would be state action.

Also, under

Tenney v. Brandhove, it would be absolutely immune from the
monetary remedy, entirely.
I think the key point is that we are dealing with
individual legislators.

Should those individual legislators

be required to pay for essentially getting into a position of -~
an alleged public benefit has occurred here by them undertaking
authorized acts.

Should they be required to pay and give the

property to the public?
The chilling effect of what we deal with here cannot
be gainsayed.

You are dealing with several legislators in an

area of very difficult constitutional law.

It is the collision

between the Fifth Amendment and proper police power prerogatives.
How are eleven lay members, how should they and are they to be
held to a standard whereby if they err they are subject to
a juror's speculation?
QUESTION:

Would you agree that someone carrying out

their mandate and going on the landowner's property with a bull­
dozer would be subject to some sort of individual liability,
if in fact the act he was performing constituted a taking?

34
MR. ROLLSTQN:

C ertainly.

QUESTION:

it is just the fact that these people

8.0*

are legislators,rather than actually carrying out the legisla=
tion*fchat is important to you on that score?
MR, ROLLSTQN:

Gn that score* because you are talking

about* at best* an executive act.

You are not talking about

someone deciding* as a matter of policy* what the law should be.
You are talking about someone going out there and physically
doing it.

And what we deal with here is completely the opposite.
Vie do not believe that the remedy that is necessary

or appropriate here is a monetary remedy,

This Court has con»

sistently focused on the adequacy of alternative relief in the
context of governmental entities to ascertain whether it was
appropriate to imply a monetary remedy.

That is how it should

be and that is how it has always been.

If Petitioners' rule is

adequate* you are literally dealing with a situation in which
by a judicial determination that some authorised legislative
act exceeds permissible bounds* that there is thereby — if it
Is invalidated for any reason* the prospect of monetary relief
against those legislators who went out there and adopted that
particular legislative act.
QUESTION:

Before you sit down* are you going to

suggest why the cause of action issue is here?
MR„ ROLLSTQN:

Well* Your Honor* the precise question

-- Well* first, it was raised prior to certiorari being granted.

35
It is in the brief.
QUESTION:

Who raised it?

MR* ROLLSTGN:
QUESTION:

He didn't cross-petition?

MR* ROLISTON:
QUESTION:

Co-Respondent on behalf of —

Did not.

I know you put it in your brief.

MRi. ROLLSTGN:

But it was also in the cross-petition

further -~
QUESTION:

What cross-petition?

MR. ROLLSTGN:

I am sorry, the petition in opposition

-- the opposition brief to certiorari.
QUESTION:

Do you think that entitles you to raise

it?
MR* ROLLSTON: Well, that# particularly when we deal
with a circumstance of: Should absolute immunity be appropriate
for a legislative act? We are assuming that a monetary remedy
comes in there.

I think it is clearly within# and reasonably

subsumed within the questions presented to this Court.
QUESTION:

I take it that the Court of Appeals antici­

pated that there would be further proceedings in the lower
court against some of the individuals.
MR* ROLISTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And yet if you won on the cause of action

issue the case would be over.
MR* ROLISTON:

As to the individuals

36
QUESTION:

Well, as to everybody.

MR» ROLLSTON:

Injunctive and declaratory relief

would remain. Your Honor»
QUESTION:

Why, if there is no cause of action?

Don’t you need a cause of action to get an injunction?

I

thought you did»
MR» ROLLSTON:

Certainly, Your Honor, but there are

other causes of action in the nature of injunctive and declara­
tory relief that are here.

And I agree with Counsel on that

score, that the precise question, cause of action, was not a
subject in the petition or raised prior to certiorari being
granted.
QUESTION: So are you abandoning that?

I am sure that

we don't like to deal with any more than we have to»

So are

you suggesting that we need not and should not deal with the
cause of action issue?
MR» RQLIDTQN: With whether the complaint states a
cause of action, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, the Court of Appeals ruled that

there was a cause of action stated under both the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments.

And,I take it, your brief -- I am

reading here -- you say the number one question is:

Is a

cause of action properly implied for Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendment due process claims?
MR» ROLLSTON:

For damages, Your Honor»

That's our

37
c one ern.
QUESTION:

Must we reach those* or not?

MR, ROLLSTQN:

I believe you must reach that

question*, and that that question would determine what is* by
all accounts* the Respondents1 who I represent* most critical
concern in this case.

And that is whether damages are appropri

ate.
QUESTION:

You are saying

I gather — that we may

address that in the context of damages* but we may not address
the cause of action question in the context of injunctive or
declaratory relief.

Is that what you are saying?

MR, ROLLSTON:
QUESTION:

Is that what you are saying?

MR, ROLLSTQN:
QUESTION:

That specific matter —

Yes* Your Honor.

So there may be a cause of action for

injunctive or declaratory relief* but a different cause of
action is involved when you are seeking monetary damage* is
that it?
MR, ROLLSTQN:

Yes* Your Honor.

The key difference

has to do with the other remedies being there, the fact that
wa are dealing with a Legislative act* rather than an Executive
act.

And I think it equally deals with separation of powers*

because in a context where a court is essentially asked to
decide what property should be in the public domain* I submit*
that's a Legislative question.

When a public entity has not

38
decided and has no power to acquire it.
Thank you.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shuts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. CLEMENT SHUTE, JR. , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SHUTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

Court:
I will argue two points, that Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency is not a state agency of California or Nevada, and is
not entitled to state sovereign immunity, and even if the
agency were considered an instrumentality of the state, the
states have not ’waived their Eleventh Amendment immunity, or
sovereign immunity through the compact.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with your friends and your

colleague that California could have done independently and
Nevada the same what the agency did in its own name? .
MR. SHUTE:

Certainly, Your Honor, both states would

have had the authority to do this through state instrumentali­
ties or local instrumentalities.
QUESTION:

When you say "authority to do this,"

define the land-use zoning?

We are not talking about a taking

now.

MR. SHUTE:
QUESTION:
would they not?

That’s correct.
They would also have the power to take,

39
MR, SHUTE:

That’s correct.

For example, California

has a Coastal Commission with regulatory authority, which is a
state agency.

It is organized that way.

QUESTION:

If each state could do it with immunity,

what is there that prevents the two states from creating an
entity, as they did here, to do exactly the same thing?
MR. SHUTE: . There is nothing to prevent it, but in
fact if you read this compact closely there is a great reluctance
on the part of both states to give this agency great authority
QUESTION:

You mean they could have done this but they

didn't?
MR. SHUTE:

They did not do it, Your Honor.

This

agency has been characterized by the Ninth Circuit in People v.
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency as not a super agency, and that
both states only reluctantly gave authority because of political
and policy reasons between California and Nevada.
QUESTION:

But from the point of view of your liti­

gating posture, all you have to shoitf is that California is
entitled to the result it obtained in the Ninth Circuit.

You

don't have to show affirmatively that the planning agency does
not have any immunity, do you?
MR, SHUTE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We, perhaps,

should have a table in the middle of the room, because we join
with Petitioners on the argument of the agency not being a
state agency and we are co-respondents on other issues in this

40

litigationo
One of the Court's questions was whether a home rule
city in California would be entitled to Eleventh Amendment
immunity.

And this Court has held in Moor v. County of Alameda

that California counties are sufficiently independent from the
state to not be entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.
I am sure the same result would obtain as to a home
rule city.

And, in theory, two states could agree to create

a city, across state lines, giving all the power that would be
given to cities in both states.
QUESTION:

Well, they might have to have a compact.

MR, SHUTE:

And they would have to have a compact.

But that agency would have all the attributes of a local
government and there is no inherent reason why because it was
created under a compact, that it should be considered an instru­
mentality of the state.
QUESTION:

Then you are telling us that if the

compact had recited that each of the sovereign states hereby
delegates to the agency its powers of eminent domain and its
powers to regulate land use and to make zoning classifications,
they could have done that.
MR. SHUTE:
QUESTION:
MR. SHUTE:
direct state control.

They could have done that.
Then there would be absolute immunity.
And there presumably would also be
And that's one of the points that I want

4'J.

to emphasize»
QUESTION: Would it make any difference in that circum­
stance, whether the Governor in each of the states appointed five
of the members or whether they were elected by popular election?
MR* SHUTS:

Well, I think it might not matter if they

were elected by popular election

and had otherwise exercised

state authority, but 1 think that state control is the key to
whether an instrumentality of the state has been created.

And

with this compact,the Governor of California appoints one memberj
a state officer from the Natural Resources Agency is another
member.

The state delegation is actually a minority of the five

members allegedly representing the interests of California.
The Governor has no veto power over actions of the agency.
The highlight of this, I think, is the fact that California has
been sufficiently displeased with the actions of the Tahoe
Regional Planning Agency, on occasion to have sued it.

And

then it suffered the debacle and irony of losing the litigation.
And that was in People v, Tahoe Regional Planning Agency in 516
Fed. 2d, where California did not approve of the means by which
the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency had allowed two highrlse
casinos in Nevada to be approved for construction.
We litigated In the district Court and in the 9th
the nature of the compact and the nature of the kind or
approval it had been given, and the court found that this was
a limited body, the TRPA, and that it had approved these casinos

42

by default and said California loses.
Well5 if the Director of the Department of Motor
Vehicles of a state announces that no longer will license plates
be required in the state and the governor doesn't think that’s
the correct way to proceed* he will call the director in and
say* "Knock it off* or we'll get a new director,"

You don't

see State versus Department of Motor Vehicles litigating what
the director's authority is,
I think that illustrates very aptly that California
or Nevada do not control the actions of this agency,
QUESTION:

That litigation is final on the zoning for

these highrise gambling places?
MR0 SHUTE:

That litigation is final.

And it was

on a point having to do with what happens when two states die*»
agree,

There is other litigation concerning the same casinos.

But the actions of the TRPA are still subject to litigation
and some of that litigation is brought by California.
don’t believe that we control that agency.
ence that we don’t control it.

So* we

We know from experi­

And we think that one of the

primary tests for the creation of a state instrumentality is
state control.
Now the Court also asked:

What is this agency?

It

is very difficult to know* because it is a unique creation by
interstate compact.

It has some attributes of a local agency.

It has some attributes of a regional agency.

It may even have

43
some attributes of state agencies.

The Ninth Circuit said it

was entirely a matter of Federal law,which preempted any state
law.

So xve believe that it is a creation or creature of Federal

law, subject to Federal court jurisdiction, because it is not
cloaked with the state's immunity.
QUESTION:

Couldn't the matter be controlled by

Federal law but still be a state agency and still not be subject
to the Eleventh Amendment?
MR® SHUTE:

Yes, Your Honor.

Certainly in the in-

stance, for ©cample, where there would have been a waiver due
to the circumstances.
QUESTION:

1 suppose state officers and state agencies

can violate Federal laxv and get sued for it without it turning
them into Federal Instrumentalities.
MR. SHUTE:

That is correct, but that illustrates

the uniqueness of an interstate compact.

It has been con­

sidered to be a creation of Federal law, and that is what the
Ninth Circuit held.

The Ninth Circuit further held that it

preempted any claims under state law.

So xve are dealing here

with a creature of Federal law through the compact.
QUESTION:

But Federal law can’t be activated..

Only

the states can activate it, isn’t that so?
MR. SHUTE:
ratifies it.

That is correct. Your Honor, and Congress

But I think decisions of this Court.in Petty and

certainly the Ninth Circuit in this case have indicated that it

becomes a question of Federal law because of congressional
ratification,
QUESTION:

I take it, it would have been valid for

California to have said, "We will not join this compact unless
there is an agreement that no gambling establishment may be
created within twenty miles from the center line of Lake Tahoe."
if there is a center line,
MR, SHUTS:

Your Honor has hit directly on one of the

sore points between the two states.

California would prefer that

there not be an expansion of gaining and Nevada disagrees.

And

this is what makes this negotiation for compacts difficult,
QUESTION:

You mean that wasn‘t even anticipated by

California?
MR, SHUTE:

It was anticipated, and there is language

in the compact to grandfather certain casino location, and
that was the compromise that was struck at that time.
has been a continuing sore point.

But it

And it illustrates the

complexity of negotiating between states in such a sensitive
area.
QUESTION:

How much sovereignty did California give

up?
MR, SHUTE:

We submit that California gave up no

sovereignty,
QUESTION:

That*s what I thought.

But they didn’t

give up sovereignty, they gave up immunity, I thought that was

45
your position.
MR. SHUTS:

Well;, we are saying that the Tahoe

Regional Planning Agency is not an instrumentality of the state.
It is not entitled to any immunity.

We argue that we don't

believe it is in question.
QUESTION:

MR. SHUTS:

The land itself belongs to California.
No* the land belongs — the land is

located within California and Nevada and much of it is in
private ownership* and some is in Federal ownership.
QUESTION:

Part of the land that originally was in

California is still California land* taxed by California,
controlled by California.
MR. SHUTE:
QUESTION:

Through the local zoning authority.
Mr. Shuts, is the State of California a

party to this suit?
MR. SHUTE:

The State of California was a named

defendant in the complaint* but —
QUESTION:
MR. SHUTE:
QUESTION:
MR. SHUTE:

Has never been served.
-« has never been served.
So* why are you here?
Because we were parties in two of the

other consolidated actions before the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:
MR. SHUTE:

Are those two actions before us?
It is our understanding that the Ninth

Circuit entered one judgment in the consolidated opinion with

46
the four cases and that technically the four cases are here*
QUESTION:
MR* tSHUTB:

Who is representing those cases?
No one.

No one has appeared to file the

briefs.
QUESTION:
MR. (SHUTS:

And you think they are still here?
I am not sure about that# Your Honor# but

I do know the rules say that if it is one judgment the cases
are before the Court.
QUESTION: Well# assuming for the moment# you are
properly here# the only issue addressed in your brief# if I
remember it correctly# is the- Eleventh Amendment issue.

Is that

right?
MR. SHUTS:

In the opposition to certiorari# we argued

no Eleventh Amendment waiver.

In our brief on the merits# we

pointed out that we do not believe that the TRPA is an instru­
mentality of the state.
of our brief.

That occupies about ten or twelve pages

So we have briefed the point that I am arguing.

QUESTION:

I am a little bit puzzled.

This goes back

before your time to the Amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure# when you could bring in parties.

Originally a

defendant was allowed to bring in a party that was -- that he
claimed was liable to the plaintiff instead of him.

And the

result was that all sorts of defendants used that rule to kind
of point the finger at somebody else and say# "No# it's not me#
it's the other guy."

And they finally changed that rule because

47
of that fact.
It seems to me the state’s position here is a little
bit like that.

You are not just trying to get yourself off the

hook, -you are trying to get the agency on the hook.
MR» SHUTE:

No, Your Honor, we are -- First of all,

v/e were parties in the other cases consolidated.

And I would

respectfully request that our role be considered amicus curiae,
if the Court disagrees that we are properly parties in this
action.

But, beyond that, it is our position that a state

instrumentality was not created.
by the Ninth Circuit.

That was expressly ruled on

And that is why we take this position.

We never did think the agency was entitled to Federal immunity.
No one did until the Ninth Circuit came out with that ruling on
its own motion.
QUESTION:

But how could that hurt the State of

California, if this Court were to hold that it was entitled to
some sort of immunity?
MR. SHUTE:

Well, because then it would be considered

a state instrumentality, and in a state court proceeding,
presumably, we could be responsible for its actions, "when,
as I had pointed out, we don't believe that we control them,
and we don't,therefore, think we should be responsible.
Just a brief observation on waiver.

The parties

agree on the test to be applied, that there must be either an
expressed waiver or a xvaiver by such overwhelming implication

48
as leaves room for no other reasonable construction.
Article 6(b),which has been alluded to, is basically
an enforcement provision.

It gives venue and jurisdiction over

actions brought by or against the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.
We believe the reference to Federal court jurisdiction refers
to otherwise existing Federal jurisdiction, as where the TRPA
brings a lawsuit in Federal court, by general appearance,
waiving whatever immunity it might have for that particular
case.
And, further, that language could refer to general
Federal jurisdiction that would ■ exist if our position is
correct, that a state instrumentality has not bean created, in
any event.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, what if we agree

with you on the immunity issue?
with respect to the agency?

Where do we go here then

Put the individuals aside, what

do we do then?
MR. SHUTS:

The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency would

be a proper party in the Federal court proceeding, because
we do not assert the state’s immunity.
QUESTION:

Eo we just decide the Eleventh Amendment

issue and if vie disagree with the Court of Appeals just reverse
and stop there, is that what we do with respect to the agency?
MR. SHUTE:

I think what you should do is decide that

the agency is not an instrumentality of the state and is not

49

entitled to assert state's immunity, and then there would be no
further Eleventh Amendment issue.
QUESTION:

I know, but is that the only issue for

us, with respect to the agency?
MR* SHUTE:

I think, Your Honor, there can be other

issues with respect to the kinds of causes of action —
QUESTION:

Does the state have a position on the

cause of action question, or not?
MR* SHUTE:

No, Your Honor.

The argument of whether

Bivens can be raised before this Court, and so forth, we have
not briefed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have just one minute

left, Mr. Bartko.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BARTKO, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BARTKO:

The Court has focused on the cause of

action question, which has been neglected by the parties and
treated as one of only remedy.

In fact, we believe that that

question is one which can be easily decided in Petitioners'
favor.
If there is a hierarchy of constitutional rights,
there is none that should be singled out for greater protection
than the Fifth Amendment.

This Court has already implied such

a cause of action for violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The

50
language of the Fifth Amendment., itself* specifically, proscribes
the taking of property without just compensation,

It is- a long

and easily recognized right in the history of this country.

It

was recognized before the Constitution* is expressed in the
Constitution
QUESTION:

Your submission is* when you are talking

about the Fifth? Is there any agency created by an interstate
compact as part of the Federal Government?

And if it had

power of condemnation and took something* send them to the
Court of Claims and get the money.
MR, BARTKO:

Is that your submission?

It is not our submission.

It is that

it is appropriate as a Fourteenth Amendment clam as well* and
we pled it under Section 1983»
QUESTION:

Why do you keep talking about the Fifth

Amendment?
MR. BARTKO:

Because the Ninth Circuit has* in fact*

put us in that position.

Vie believe our 1983 claims are

equally appropriate,
QUESTION:

Well* you need to talk about the Fifth

Amendment* if you are going to say that it was incorporated in
the Fourteenth* don't you?
MR. BARTKO:
QUESTION:

Yes* we do* Your Honor.
And then your analogy is basically to

Moor v. County of Alameda* in saying that this instrumentality
is like a subdivision of a state which doesn T:t get Eleventh

51
Amen dm en t Immunity ?
MR. SARTKO:

That is correct.

It is a lower body

not entitled to immunity.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you. gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 11:05 o'clock* a.m.* the case was
submitted.)
