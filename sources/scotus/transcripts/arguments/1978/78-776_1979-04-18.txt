But th t--the fact that it didn't indicates--? mean
that question raises some serious proble?ne.
I think another absurd result that might reoult from
this decision is that Section 922(h) (1), under which the
respondent was prosecuted and convicted, applies not only to
those who have b en

of a felony, but those

t-o were

under indictment for a felony.
There is no s11ch equivalent provision in the

Therefore, n defendant who wes under indict-

five year penalty, but a day later, when he

convicted, the

Turn..ng to the quo6tion of constitutione.1--the
underlying con£titutional que tiona, aa Y've indicated, the
two

statute•, llthough in application in this ease have similar

proof involved, they are vury different.
The &ecpe of the two statutes, the person's activitie•, and the eonmeree elauao element are very different.
And indeed, as this Court recognized both in Baas and in
Scarborough, it may well have been that

it

was enacting, in the bio-year otatute, a statute along the
lines of Perez, thaL is, a stetute not requiring individualized
proof of co::imerce clause juria11ction in each and every ease.
And i'l Jfar e.s tho Congress thought that it was
doing that,

t:W'o statutos wore very much

After t e decisions in B&ns, Barrett and Scarborough,
they're still d f o e t

&or.tething of that nature.
Thero'o no assertion in this case that there are-that prosecuticn was bn&ed on any of those factors.
But

look:l.ng at tho record, one can well

imagine why the prosecutor chose to pursue revpondent under
