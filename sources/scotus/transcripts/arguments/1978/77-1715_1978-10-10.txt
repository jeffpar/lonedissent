MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: .We will hear arguments
next in No. 77-1715* Secretary of Public Welfare of
Pennsylvania against Institutionalized Juveniles.
Mr. Watkins, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J. WATKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from a three-judge court determin­
ation that two of Pennsylvania's statutes, which prov5.de that
parents may voluntarily admit their children to mental health
or mental retardation treatment in Pennsylvania facilities,
are unconstitutional.
The statutes involved are, first, a 1966 Act that
provides that parents of a mentally retarded child, under
the age of eighteen, may apply for voluntary admission of
that child for treatment.

Upon acceptance and a determination

that the child is, in fact,, in need of mental retardation
therapy, the child may then be admitted upon the application
of the child.
The 1976 Act provides that parents of a mentally
ill child, under the age of fourteen, upon the application of
the parent and upon the determination of a psychiatrist or
a physician of the need for treatment, may consent to the

4
voluntary treatment of that child.
Furthermore» under the 1966 Act» Pennsylvania
promulgated, regulations that require — and this deals with
the mentally retarded again — that require not one» but two,
independent medical determinations that the child is, in fact,
retarded and requires the treatment which has been recom­
mended .
The Plaintiffs in this case, and there are twelve
of them nine of whom are mentally, ill and three mentally re­
tarded, all were admitted upon application of their parent
or guardian or one standing in loco parentis.

Eight were,

in fact, admitted by their kparents and four were admitted
by child care agencies, inasmuch as they were, for one
reasons or another, wards of the state.
Each of these children -- and this is typical —
have had

and the record shows this -- a minimum of three

independent medical evaluations, indicating the need for
the treatment which they were receiving.

Furthermore, not

one of these Appellees nor any members of the class involved
strike that -- not one of these Appellees sought to termin­
ate that treatment by way of any of the existing court pro»
cedures of which they may avail themselves from moment one
after the admission.
Furthermore, as we.stand here, some of the Appellees
remain in the treatment setting and there are mo proceedings

5
under way in state.court to terminate that treatment.
Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs brought this challenge primarily
and exclusively on the Due Process Clause, asserting that
prior to the effectuation of the admission the children had
a right to counsel and the full panoply of due process.
The lower court, agreeing with the Plaintiffs,
ordered essentially two hearings. First, what was called the
probable cause hearing at which it would be determined if,
in fact, there was probable cause in the courts or the
tribunals of view to believe that the child was mentally ill
or retarded and whether or not the medically recommended
treatment was, in fact, advisable.

Within two weeks of that

hearing, assuming affirmative findings on both counts, the
tribunal would convene a full adversary proceeding at which
the findings required are whether, in fact, the child is
mentally ill or retarded and whether, in fact, the treatment
which has been medically recommended is approved by the court
or tribunal.
QUESTION:

You say or a tribunal.

What is the

alternative to a court?

judicial hearings.

Well, initially,-» this case has

Initially, the lower court required
This order was slightly amended to allow

the state to provide an independent neutral tribunal.

How­

ever, it should be noted that this tribunal must have the

6
authority to protect the child's rights which are specified
rights to cross-examination, to present testimony and further­
more to approve a waiver of this significant constitutional
right which the child has been given by the lower court's
order,
QUESTION:

Has the Pennsylvania Legislature created

such a tribunal?
MR. WATKINS:

Not at this time, Your Honor,

I would suggest, also, that the court’s modifica­
tion-

as to the tribunal —and the requirement of counsel —

has been substituted by the requirement for a trained advocate,
However, once again, this trained advocate must be able to
vouchsafe the child's rights to cross-examine and confront
witnesses, present testimony and, in fact, must be able to .
make the legal determination of whether or not the child
should waive his rights to ~~
QUESTION:

Where did they come from?
MR. WATKJNo :•

The lower court modified the original

two significant modifications.

And those are the

However, as I relate in my

brief, the practical effect of them is probably not very
significant inasmuch as a lawyer and a judge are

7
QUESTION:

Where is the source of a trained advocate,

if not the bar?
MR* WATKINS:

As far as I am concerned, it would

have to be the bar,
QUESTION:

Did the district court —

MR, WATKINS:
QUESTION:

There was no elucidation on that point.

Normally, in the district court the

source is the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of
the United States.
MR* WATKINS:

Absolutely.

The entire order is

predicated upon that.
QUESTION:

I didn't ask my question clearly enough.

By source, I simply meant where is this pool of trained

advocates?
MR. WATKINS:

None exists presently, Mr. Justice

Brennan, other than the. bar.

And, again, in order to waive

this right,which the trained advocate would have the right
to do, I would suspect that a lawyer would be required.
There are two threshold questions in this case as
in the previous.

First is, of course, whether or not these

children in this context possess a liberty interest which is
cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is my position that the lower court in finding
such a liberty interest made,essentially, four analytical errors.
First, without any evidence whatsoever the lower court

3
presumed that in this context parents may toe presumptively
assumed to act contrary to the interest of their children*
Moreover, the court presumed, without any evidence bearing
this out that -QUESTION:

That doesn't really have anything to do

with whether or not there is a deprivation of liberty, does
it?
MR. WATKINS:

I think to the extent that the lower

court relied on this Court's analysis in In Re Gault, it
certainly does, because clearly -~
QUESTION:

A voluntary commitment results in a

deprivation of liberty, doesn't it?

A voluntary commitment

by an adult results in a deprivation of liberty.
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

A voluntary or involuntary?

Voluntary.

MR. WATKINS:

A deprivation of liberty, absolutely,

but it is not of constitutional significance because -«•
QUESTION:

But it does result In a deprivation of

liberty.
MR. WATKINS: . That's correct.
QUESTION:

So, therefore, I would think this view

of the district court which you are attacking has nothing to
do with it, basically, or is irrelevant to the question of
whether or not there is.a deprivation of liberty.
MR* WATKINS :

me point is that the lower court, by

9
relying on this Court's decision in In Re Gault, I' think,
this percieved the relationships at stake in this case.

For

example, the lower court would liken the relationship of a
doc tor,-pa rent and child to the relationship of prosecutor and
defendant.

Obviously, when one looks at the relationship

between prosecutor and defendant in the criminal context,
there is a conflict of interest inherent in that relationship
and it should be presented.

That is not so in the relation­

ship between a parent and child and. between a doctor and
patient.

And the lower court's presumptions to this effect,

on a barren record, should be overturned.
Finally, and it has been discussed at great length
in the prior argument, the lower court's order Ignores
entirely the traditional role of the family in these
decisions.

Obviously, these are very difficult decisions.

Nevertheless, it is just these types of decisions that we
entrust to the family and entrust to the family in con­
junction with a physician, in a medical context.
QUESTION:

None of these things you have been

talking about has anything to do with whether or not there
is a deprivation of liberty, does it?
MR.'WATKINS:

I believe it does, Mr. Justice

Stewart, in the sense that when a parant acts on behalf of
his child ha is normally presumed to act In the interest of
his child.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

And when an adult acts on behalf

of himself he is presumed to be acting on behalf of himself* MR, WATKINS:

That’s correct.

QUESTION: -- in his best interest.

And when he

voluntarily commits himself to a hospital there is a depri­
vation of liberty.

Whatever else there may be, there is that.

MR, WATKINS:

That’s correct, but inasmuch as it is

voluntary, no additional proceeding is required.
QUESTION:

In other words, even if.you are right in

all your submissions on what you have just been telling us,
there still remains a deprivation of liberty.
MR. WATKINd:

That’s correct, as a factual matter.

The question which must first be addressed, though, is whether
or not as a constitutional matter, when parents act on behalf
of their children in this context
QUESTION:

Whether it is the equivalent of a

voluntary admission, that's the point, isn't it?
MR. WATKINS: • That's correct.
•

The analysis that we would urge upon this Court is,

of course, the Court’s analysis that was used in Matthews v,
Eldridge, whether or not in Pennsylvania the children have
been adequately protected throughout the process.

In

Pennsylvania, before a child can be admitted upon the
application of his parent, there must be at least one,and
most times two, medical determinations, independent, indicating

11

a need for treatment.

Moreover, from the moment the admission

begins, the child has the right to initiate judicial pro­
ceedings to test the validity of the treatment, to test the
validity of the decision of the physicians and the parents
and to test whether or not the entire procedure was consti­
tutional, if you willo
Every issue that's presented in this case could well
have been presented through habeas corpus 'proceedings in state
court.
QUESTION:

How does the child initiate that?

MR. WATKINS:
number of ways.

The child may initiata that in a

QUESTION:

'If the parent can’waive all the child's,

rights, why couldn’t the parent waive the right to bring this '
proceeding?
MR. WATKINS:

Because, as I say, in contradistinction

to the statute which provides that a parent may apply for ad­
mission, the statute, regarding habeas corpus, indicates very
clearly that any person who is institutionalized or in a
facility may challenge the basis.
QUESTION:

Yes, but a child,under ordinary -- quite

Generally

in Pennsylvania a parent speaks for his child,, doesn’t he?

That is correct.

Wouldn’t that also, presumably, be true

QUESTION:

to know where the court was?

QUESTION:

The question was asked earlier:

How

many other .cases have you had like this one? .
MR. .WATKINS:

In Pennsylvania?

None that I am

aware of.
..QUESTION:

In the world,

MR, WATKINS:

None that I am aware of, other than

the proceeding one, Mr. Justice Marshall.
. QUESTION:

All right.

I mean a ten year-old child

doesn't know about legal proceedings. -Does a ten year-old

child know what a writ of habeas corpus is?
MR. WATKINS:

That's correct, but I think the point

that the proceedings exist is that if, in fact, it is sus­
pected that the child is being treated when he does not need
to be treated anyone can initiate the proceedings.

It

needn't be the child.
QUESTION:

But did the child know whether he was

being treated properly or not, the ten year-old?
MR. WATKINS:

Presumably not, but the point is

someone else may, the child's friend, the child's —
QUESTION:

Wouldn't most of the child's friends be

ten year-olds, and no smarter than he is-?
MR. WATKINS:

In this case, Your Honor, the child's

next friend was a very competent advocate, and I would assume
that that situation could exist elsewhere.
QUESTION:

Well, how many other cases has that

beautiful advocate filed in Pennsylvania?
MR. WATKINS:

There is a very active advocacy

I am not certain that there are any.

Admittedly, it is difficult, but just as a child —
QUESTION:

Why doesn't the argument hold that whett

any case comes up here involving incarceration without due
process to say you can remedy that by ignorance?

You don’t

want us to establish that principle, do you?
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

In this case, I would not --

You don*t want to say to the state you

can put anybody in jail if he allows them to file a writ of
habeas corpus?
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.

I hope not.

MR. WATKINS:

The purposes of that confinement are

manifestly different, however, from the;confinement in this
case.

And I should point out that the confinement which has

been attacked and adjoined in this case — the treatment runs
the gamut not only from institutions but all the way down to
group homes and small family-like settings,

So that many of

the arguments which may or.may not exist, Indicating that
there need be safeguards against such treatment, really do
not apply with respect to this Court's order.
I would also urge that one of the primary reasons
that we place importance on these procedures is to minimize
the child's admitted interest in not being erroneously

16
admitted to a mental health or mental retardation facility.
I would suggest that the record in this case, as
well as Pennsylvania statutes, indicate very clearly that
rigorous safeguards are in place to assure that, in fact.,
this medical determination of the need for treatment is
appropriate and that the admission and the treatment under­
taken is appropriate.

It is important to note that in

Pennsylvania there are required, by law, periodic reviews of
the child5s treatment program, so that if it turns up that
the child no longer needs treatment, by law, the child must
be discharged from treatment.
QUESTION:

Are all

these

same procedures equally

applicable to adults who have voluntarily committed them»

selves?
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Pennsylvania equates the two?

MR, WATKINS:

Pennsylvania equates the two with

respect to treatment, not with respect to the process for
admission, other than equating an act of a parent for the
act of a child.

That's »»

QUESTION:

With that exception, it equates*™ voluntary

commitments.are voluntary commitments.
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

For an adult, they are done on behalf

of himself or herself, for a child they are done on behalf

17

of that child by his or her parent.
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

Beyond that, they are precisely iden­

tical; is that right?
MR. WATKINS;

Absolutely.

One of the central arguments to the Plaintiffs'
case in this case is that we should mistrust the diagnoses
of professionals in the field of psychiatry and in the field
of mental retardation.
QUESTION;

In Pennsylvania, will the Pennsylvania

state institutions take children who need treatment but could
be treated at home?
MR. WATKINS:

In Pennsylvania, the law with respect

to the mentally ill is very specific that they must be
provided the least restrictive setting where treatment may
be afforded.

The law is not that clear with respect, to the

mentally retarded.

That is the older statute.

However,

it is the policy of
QUESTION:' The parents can't get the state just to
warehouse their children?
MR. WATKINS;

Absolutely not.

Not only because

of the legal mandate, but the state has an interest in
keeping the rolls of its facilities down.

It is expensive

to provide treatment, and Pennsylvania, like every other
state, has a,scarcity of resources,

It simply is not easy

18

to gain access to these facilities.
QUESTION:

You make that same statement in your

brief., "like every other state."

Would it shock you if I

said I know of states where there is overflow capacity,
unused capacity in state mental institutions, since the
advent of the tranquilizer?

What’s the matter with

Pennsylvania?
MR. WATKINS:

Pennsylvania, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

is making a strong effort at lowering the population of its
facilities and has done a great deal toward that.

The fact

of the matter is that resources are not being placed in
Institutions, but rather diverted to community resources.
St is a long and arduous task, but at present time, with that
effort in mind, it simply is very difficult to gain admission
to a facility in Pennsylvania,
QUESTION:

Well, I am merely saying that I

question the accuracy of your statement, because I know
states where there is surplus room in state institutions.
MR, WATKINS:

I may have taken liberty.

I know

that it is generally referred to in studies as a common
national problem, the overuse and overutilization and under­
staffing of facilities throughout the country.

However,

there may be states in far better shape than Pennsylvania
in that respect.
The point that I was making is that the lower

19
court’s finding, and central to the Plaintiff’s case, I
think, is a presumptive mistrust of medical determinations
in this area.

And I. suppose that the mistrust springs, in

large part, from the nature of the treatment that often
follows a medical determination in this area.
I would suggest, first and foremost, that the
evidence in this record does not indicate that any of the
medical evaluations and recommendations for treatment were,
in fact, erroneous, were, in fact, inadvisable,

X would

further suggest that the court made no findings to that
effect, and 1 would suggest that if, indeed, it is difficult
for psychiatrists and psychologists to make these difficult
determinations, it probably would beequally as difficult for
lawyers and judges to do so who are completely untrained in
the field.
It is this lack of merit for the adversary pro­
ceedings that is most troubling.

We are going to inject into

the diagnostic process a procedure which, at best, is going
to prove to_ probably, ratify any unchecked medical opinions
that are offered at the trial.

And, if not, it is going to

prove as a debating ground for professionals in the field,

i
and I question whether or not the tribunal would be qualified
i
to determine the final result accurately.
It is important to note that in Pennsylvania if
there is disagreement with respect- to the retarded, if there

20

is disagreement between professionals as to the admission,
the admission simply does not take place and may not take
place,
QUESTION:

Mr, Watkins, I think we were told that

in Georgia if the institution determines that the child could
better be treated at home, but the parents say, "No, we simply
can’t take care of the child at home," then the institution
would take the child,
Are you telling us that in Pennsylvania in that
situation the institution could say no, the parents must
take the child back?
MR, WATKINS:

With respect to a mentally ill child,

yes. The institution must say no.
QUESTION:

If treatment —-

If it says no, then the parents must

take the childj is that it?
MR, WATKINS:

Provided that the professionals do

not determine that that would endanger the child.
QUESTION:

Well, the hypothetical in the Georgia

case was that the institution said that the child would be
better off at heme, but the p:rent refused to have the child
at home, saying, "No, too disturbung.
get on,"

We simply could not

So the child in that circumstance the institution

would take.

That is not the case in Pennsylvania?

MR, WATKINS:
that is true

With respect to the mentally ill,

21

QUESTION:

How about as to the retarded?

MR, WATKINS:
know.

That 5.0 not the case, as far as I

The determination must be made by the institution.

Independently of any recommendations that come to it, that
the child is, in fact, retarded and, in fact, needs the
treatment at that facility.

So that, absent those f:tnd3.ngs

by the state, there could be no admission,
QUESTION:

You were going' to describe the situation

as to the retarded now.
MR, V:ATKINS:

What about that?
In Pennsylvania, the mentally re­

tarded may not be admitted to any state or private facility
without two independent determinations that that admission
is required.

Furthermore, children thirteen years of age

and older, under the regulations are provided — if they
object in any way, orally or in writing, to the continuation
of the treatment -- they are automatically provided counsel
and automatically provided what amounts to an involuntary
commitment proceeding,. That's for children thirteen and over.
Children under thirteen, it IS presumed that they cannot
competently object, a presumption which, I might add, carries
throughout medicine in Pennsylvania.

Children under the age

of eighteen in Pennsylvania, unless they are married or are
pregnant or are seeking pregnancy services, simply may not
consent to or 'withdraw from treatment, absent parental consent.
Thus, the program with respect to mental illnesses is very

22
similar.
QUESTION:
procedure.

Could I ask you a question about the

Maybe it is clear from the record, but

The individuals who make the determination that the child is
in need of care or treatment -- I forget the exact statutory
language — and also the people who make the annual review
under the statute, are they full-time staff members or are
they some part-time people who are also in private practice?
MR. WATKINS:

In both cases, they would be full-time

staff.
QUESTION:

They-would be full-time employees of the

state?
MR. WATKINS:

There may be exceptions to that, but

the statute and regulations require with respect to the re­
tarded that the staff at the facility determine.

And,

although there are some part-time medical staff at these
facilities, there are — in every facility, there is a body
of full-time medical staff,
QUESTION;

Do we know how many of those people

have to be doctors, M.D.'s?
MR. WATKINS:

In the case of the retarded, there

has to be a determination by either a physician or a
psychologists who is trained In the area of mental re­
tardation.

With respect to the.mentally ill, it must be

a medical determination.

23

QUESTION: ' When you say "doctors*” do .you mean Just;
a doctor- you don’t mean a psychiatrist?

He just has to be

MR. WATKINS:

ta rd ed, fc ha t ’ s c orrec t.
QUESTION:

He doesn't have to be more than just

Could an obstetrician do it?
MR, WATKINS:

An obstetrician, presumably, if that

physician felt competent to make this medical diagnosis and
he was licensed to do so, he could make the diagnosis and
it would be •*- Unless the medical people in our facility
disagreed, that recommendation would be given credence, yes.
QUESTION:

Does this judgment that is under review

here affect the institutionalization in private facilities?
MR, WATKINS:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Are you making the same argument with

respect to them or a different argument?
MR, WATKINS :

The same arguments, plus the asser­

tion that X made In my brief that with respect to admissions
to private facilities there simply is no state action.
State employees are not involved; state employees don’t
provide the examinationsj state employees, in fact, play no
part in the admission process and, In fact, the state receives
no notice, necessarily, of these admissions.

The only contact

the state has, with respect to these — and there are

24

probably over 350 private facilities involved — the only
contact that it would have is the fact that the legislature
has provided the rules under which they are supposed to
provide these admissions.
QUESTION:

How did the district court deal with

that argument on state action?
MR, WATKINS:

The district 'court* in my view, dealt

with it incorrectly -QUESTIGN:

How did it deal with it?

MR, WATKINS:

It simply found that because the

admissions were obtained pursuant to state law, then the
state was involved,

I suggest that that is not the test that

this Court has set down in cases such as Flagg Brothers and
■ Metropolitan Ed Ison and similar cases.
So that, what we have involved here, so we are
entirely clear, are not only the mentally ill but the
mentally retarded, and not only state institutions but private
as well, and not only institutions but group homes and com­
munity based treatment facilities, as well.
Any time any parent seeks in-patient osyehiatric
or mental retardation habilitation;services for his child in
Pennsylvania there must be a full panoply of due process
unless those procedures are waived.
' QUESTION:

Was this judgment on remand before or

after the Flagg Brothers case?

Do you know that case?

25
MR, WATKINS:

I don't know,

I can't put the dates

together at this particular moment, although it clearly was
after Metropol1tan Edis on.

X think the Judgment runs afoul

of the test in that case as well* or certainly the Court's
teachings in that case.
QUESTION:

To what extent does the State of

Pennsylvania regulate the private institutions?
just license them?

Do they

Do they inspect them?

MR. WATKINS:

There may be limited inspection - »

none that 1 am aware of and none that has been brought before
the Court ~~ there is nothing in the record on this.

As

far as the law provides* it is merely a licensure or approval
of the facilities to dispense service.
QUESTION:

Does the state regulate staffing?

MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not. Mr.Justice Brennan.

Do they forbid institutionalization In

private hospitals unless these procedures are satisfied?
MR. WATKINS:

That is the state law.

There is no

regulatory body to approve each admission or to see that,
in fact, it is followed.

One presumes that these facilities

are following state law,

The fact of the matter in Pennsyl­

vania and Involved in this case are a number of facilities
that bear no relationship whatsoever to what xve normally have
in mind when we talk about mental institutions, facilities
that may, Indeed, be private schools, or the like, that have

26

been,b©cause of some special cadre of professionals that they
employ, have been approved by the state to provide these
services when necessary.
The fact of the matter is that the 'lower court's
order would require treatment of all of those children as
prospective mental patients.

I think this clearly is going

to be injui'ious to the children.

It Is certainly not going

to be conducive to the serious undertakings that are taking
place in those facilities.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ferleger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FERLEGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR, FERLEGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to begin by correcting a number of
errors in Mr. Watkins' presentation.
First, the Habeas Corpus statute in Pennsylvania,
page 6 of his brief,, indicates that the courts have Jurisdic­
tion over habeas cases only when the person has been com­
mitted by a court, not — or by a two-doctor medical
certificate -» but that statute has been declared uncon­
stitutional.
If a child could get into court under habeas, I
believe the statute would require the court to reject that

27

petition.
Secondly ~QUESTION:

Do you mean Pennsylvania doesn't provide

habeas relief for confinement, generally?
MR. FERLEGER:

The Habeas Corpus statute with

regard to mental patients ~~ at pages 5 and 6 of Mr. Watkins',
brief -*> and that gives jurisdiction and venue on the several
courts of the Commonwealth for petitions, and Sections 1, 2
and 3 indicate that it has to be a place where a court has
ordered the commitment.
For the mentally retarded, I want to note that,
as Mr. Justice Marshall raised, the state regulations permit
the retarded to be committed —
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferleger, before you leave the first

point, why isn't the language of Subparagraph (a), quoted on
page 5#brcad enough to cover a child's petition?

Subparagraph

(b) just talks about the grounds he may allege.

I don't think

(b) is exclusive,
MR, FERLEGER:

No, (b) is not at all exclusive.

I

was talking about (c), which is the jurisdictional section,
Mr, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Oh, X see, but the language of (a)

would seem to cover any child.
MR, FERLEGER:

The language of (a) is more general,

but when you get to (c) which :1s where courts have jurisdiction,

28

I believe that would exclude juveniles.
QUESTION:

If a child was found in an institution

and the parents didn't know where the child was and found the
child in an institution in Pennsylvania, there is no way the
parents could get that child?
MR. FERLEGER:

If the parents did not know where

the child was?
QUESTION:

If they didn’t know and then they

eventually did find out that the child is in Institution A.
Is there no way that the parent could get that child out of
there?

Is there no procedure in Pennsylvania for that?
MR. FERLEGER:

There aren't so far as I know.

X

think that —
QUESTION:

I just don’t believe that.

MR, FERLEGER:

I think that a parent might be able

to file some sort of a mandamus or other —
QUESTION:

Some sort of habeas ~-

MR. FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

Right.

Mr. Ferleger, I just don’t mean to

pursue it, but you started your argument on this point and
the jurisdiction restrictions in (c) relate to petitions filed
under Subsection (b), both of them.

X was asking you about

one filed under Subsection (a), and there is nothing in (c)
to limit the venue or jurisdiction of such a petition.
MR. FERLEGER:

I read the separate sections of the

29
statute as the one section of the Mental Health Law that
they are.

Ho jurisdiction is conferred on any court for any

kind of voluntary ~~
QUESTION:

You are saying, then, that there is no

jurisdiction in any court to bring a proceeding pursuant to
Subparagraph (b).

That seems highly unlikely.

MR, FERLEGER:

So far as X know, and I don't believe

there is any —
QUESTION:

There is no. court that holds that that

is the way to read Subsection (a), is there, no decision?
MR, FERLEGER:

No, none.

For the mentally retarded the recommendation for
commitment can be made by any psychologist, any physician, by
any pediatrician, regardless of the knowledge of that person
or the needs of the mentally retarded.
For the mentally ill, there, is no requirement In the
commitment statute that there be any referral, any outsideexamination, any separate examination by anyone except the
institution psychiatrist,
Mr. Watkins is incorrect that the district court
or the Plaintiffs have presumed anything about parents,
children, the conflicts between parents and children or'
between institutions and children.
The district court found, as a matter of fact,
that conflicts frequently arise with regard to mental

30
institutionalization of children.

The district court found,

as a fact, that parents often institutionalize their children
for reasons that are unrelated to the needs of those children.
The district court also found as a fact that the institutions
and their staffs have —
QUESTION:

What was the evidence on which the con­

clusion that many parents warehouse their children — what
was the evidence of that?
MR„ FERLEGER:

With regard to the mentally re­

tarded after remand, only one expert testified for the
Plaintiffs.

The Defendants put on absolutely no testimony or

evidence regarding the retarded.
QUESTION:

And what was that testimony?

MR, FERLEGER:

That testimony was that whether or

not children find themselves in mental institutions is
circumstantial, that parents are subjected to great com­
munity pressures.
QUESTION:

This was in Pennsylvania?

MR0 FERLEGER:

Yes.

The expert was familiar with Pennsylvania
facilities —
QUESTION:

Where did he come from?

MR, FERLEGER: • It was Linda Glenn who is the
Commissioner of Mental Retardation for the State of
Massachusetts

31
QUESTION:

She came from Massachusetts?

MR, FERLEGER:

That‘s right and she had toured

institutions and facilities in Pennsylvania and is familiar
with conditions in those facilities*
QUESTION:
in the facilities.

We are not talking ahout the conditions
We are talking about how the children

got there, whether or not they got there improperlyj isn’t
that right?
MR* FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

That's correct,

How would she know that?

MR, FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

How would she know?

Yes,

MR, FERLEGER:

Linda Glenn is an expert and was

stipulated to be an expert on retardation —
QUESTION:

you could be. an expert on retardation,

per se, but how does that give you a basis for an opinion
that most or a great many parents do what she said?
MR* FERLEGER:
■ •

j

■

.

The district court found that

parents often institutionalise their children for a variety
of reasons.

She —

QUESTION:

I am going to get the expert first,

How does the expert know?
MR. FERLEGER:

She knows, I believe, from her

experience working with retarded persons, working with
families of the retarded and being aware of the need of those

32
families for assistance*

For example* Exhibit 1 of the

Defendant* an application for commitment to an institution*
lists thirty-one community services and asks whether the
parent knew or didn't know that they existed, which ones had
been used,
The mother of Gina S, vjrote*
about these services."

"I don't know anything

Parents* as well as the children*

need some process* some system for dealing with their own
emotional conflicts* their own lack of knowledge of alterna­
tives to instituticnaliation.
QUESTION:

Were those thirty-one services available

to children only or children and adults?
MR. FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

Children and adults both.

Dovou suppose adults who voluntarily

commit’ themselves to mental institutions know about all those
alternative services available before they do so?
MR. FERLEGER:

They may often not know. They have

the opportunity* however, to make decisions on their own
about their own rights and what rights they want to waive or
give up.
QUESTION:

Well* children have the opportunity --

MR. FERLEGER:

Children do not* in this situation*

because there is no one with no conflict of interest to help
protect them.
QUESTION:

Does Pennsylvania have procedures for

33
determination that a parent is unfit or incompetent as a
parent because of neglect of his child or mistreatment of his
child?
MR. FERLEGER:

There are neglect

and dependency

laws in Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

So there are plenty of procedures if

there -- to find a parent, unfit as a parent and to certify
that a parent is unfit.,

And if that happens somebody else

replaces the parent in that parent’s place* in loco parentis.
MR. FERLBGER:

Yes* that is correct.

In regard to the commitment of children* mentally,
retarded or mentally ill* it's the feeling of the experts*
with regard to both classes* that a process by which the
child has an advocate and all the facts and considerations
can be aired* that that, process* just like the abortion
process, perhaps* in Beilottf v. Baird* that process is what
is most likely to lead to the best resolution of the problems,
of the child.
QUESTION:

Unlike Bellotti v. Baird, or the other

case, we are not dealing here with a parent’s veto of a
child!s wish to have medical treatment* are we?
MR, FERLEGER:

VJe are dealing with the parent’s

veto of the child ’s constitutionally protected interest and
liberty.

And that is why it is similar* in my view* to the

Qanforth situation.

1
.

QUESTION:

34

In Panfprfth, you had a child who wanted

to have medical procedures* and the question was whether the
parent could veto it.

Here you don't have the child wanting

to he admitted to the hospital* do you* and with the parent
vetoing it?
MR. FERLEGER:

The similarity is that in Danforth

what the parent was vetoing was the child *s assertion of a
constitutional right.
QUESTION:

In the mental health area —
Which has been recognized in Roe and Doe-..

Now,.is there a constitutional right not to have medical
treatment?
MR. FERLEGER:

No, but there is a constitutional

right to liberty implicated in mental institutionalization,
as the court found in O'Connor v. Donaldson,
The constitutional right here is the right to
liberty and to be free from the inherent deprivations of
liberty in institutionalization.
QUESTION:

That is not necessarily just confined to

mental institutions, that could be in a hospital where you
are placed.for treatment of a physical medicine problem;
could it not?
MR. FERLEGER:

To respond to that, Mr.Justice
?

Rehnquist, I may have some difference with Mr, Cromerty with
regard to the coerciveness factor.
is the determinant factor here.

I.don't believe that that

35
As the district court found* page ,1077 in the
Appendix, to their opinion* what we have here is not only
the stigma of mental illness* not only the chance of error*
not only the greater potential for long-term loss of liberty*
but we also have the conflict or divergence of Interest
between the parents and the child that is not present when
there are other medical treatments going on.

'We also have the

need here to consider a vast variety of non-medical considera­
tions .
QUESTION;

Let me interrupt you for a moment.

If

your critical element is the potential conflict of interest
and that’s what distinguishes it from physical treatment*
why shouldn't the factual inquiry that you have proposed and
that the lower court said was required by the Constitution*
be limited to the issue of whether or not there is* in fact* a
conflict of interest between the parents and the children*
rather than these elaborate findings as to whether the child
is or is not mentally treatable* and that sort of thing?
MR. PERLEGSR;

I think that the process ordered

by the lower court will result to a large extent in that
inquiry because —
QUESTION:

But what I am asking you is why shouldn't

it be limited to that inquiry* not whether it should result
in that inquiry inter alia.
MR. FERLEGER:

The full hearing that the lower court

36
described., the right to confrontation and presence of person
unless waived# those rights, even the right to counsel, would
not come into play unless the advocate for the child, this
independent party who could look at that issue, decided not
to waive the hearing, or unless the —
QUESTION:
decision.

Generally, an advocate doesn't make a.

An advocate is an advocate and it is a neutral

decision-maker who makes a decision.
MR. FERLEGER:

In our case, the mutual decision­

maker would have to accept or reject the waiver.

Vi hat the

court found is that because of the potentially and the
t

factually found divergences of interest between the parents
and the children, you need to put somebody else in the place
of the parent for the purpose of deciding that waiver issue,
QUESTION:

Why, unless or until you found there is

a conflict of interest ---MR, FERLEGER:

The court found out, as a matter of

fact, anchthere is no challenge by the Defendants, that that
fact is clearly erroneous,
QUESTION:

What fact Is clearly erroneous?

MR. FERLEGER:

That parents often commit children

for reasons unrelated to the needs of the children,
QUESTION:

But if a parent does that he is an unfit

parent, isn't he?
MR. FERLEGER:

Mot necessarily.

He may be a parent

37
who is unaware of alternatives*

Re may be a parent who is

pressured by neighbors or community into committing the
child.
QUESTION:

If a parent is pressured by neighbors

or community into boating his child, he is an unfit parent#
whatever the motivation comes from, isn't he?
MR. FERLEGER:

Not necessarily,

I think that there

are ****
QUESTION:

Wouldn't he be removed if you could show

to the. proper fact-finder in Pennsylvania, the juvenile court,
or whatever, that a parent habitually mistreated and beat his
child?

Wouldn't that be grounds for finding him a neglectful

parent?
MR. FERLEGER:

Yes, it would.

If the problem was

pressures outside, unrelated —
QUESTION:

Wherever the pressures came from.

MR. FERLEGER:

There might be situations where the

parent would need the help, would need the knowledge, vjould
need the assistance,of experts in order to deal with those
problems.
QUESTION:

Isn't there another alternative, that

the parent might just be uninformed and confused, not evil
in any sense?
MR. FERLEGER: . Definitely, Mr, Chief Justice.
What the experts found in our case and what the court

38
found as a fact is that the process that was mandated can
help parents deal with those sorts of issues.
would not harm treatment for the child.

The process

The court found* as

a matter of fact* that there would he —
QUESTION:

Since there is so much talk about less

restrictive measures, aren't there less restrictive measures
to inform the parents about these things than holding a fullscale hearing1, such as counseling by the state's family
guidance counselors?
MR. PERLEGER:

The district court does not require

that a full hearing be held in any case.

The district court

says a number of times that they expect that hearings won't
be required in most cases* because in many cases there will
be agreement between the parent and the child, if the child
needs to go into the hospital.

In many cases, especially

once an advocate gets involved for the child, things will be
worked out so that there is no need to insist on a hearing.
QUESTION: '-.'What's the advocate's function here, under
your theory?

Is his function to help the doctors decide what's

best ~~ the doctors and the parents decide what's best for
the child — or is his function to keep the child out of
confinement at all costs?
MR. PERLEGER:

I don't believe the advocate function

is to keep the child out of confinement at all costs.
QUESTION:

That's normally the function of an

39
advocate, Isn't It, when he is confronted with a confinement
problem?
MR, PERLEGER:
advocate.

That is often the function of an

I don't know if that is —
QUESTION:

In criminal prosecution, that's his only

function, Isn't it?
MR. FERLEGER:

Yes.

Having represented children

and adults in commitment hearings, whsfc

you often find is

a situation where it is clear that some kind of help needs
to be imposed.

At that point, I believe the function of the

advocate is to try to work out the best
QUESTION:

So, now the advocate is slipping into

the position of the medical adviser, isn't he?
MR, FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

No, I don’t believe so, because --

He is helping to decide, you said.

MR, FERLEGER:

The reason is a very important one,

that the advocate is not becoming a medical officer.

Medical

officers are not presumptively mistrusted in my view and in
district court's view...

In a commitment to a mental hospital,

there are important non-medical considerations that have to
be taken into account.

The recommendation of a psychiatrist,

even if accompanied by. the kind of detailed report that %*as
required in Spechfc v, Patterson .does not take care of the
social interests, consideration of the school, the community,
the child's friends, the child's relatives, all the kind of

40

background that is non-medical that must be considered, that
the Court held must be considered in Gagnon in the parole or
probationer revocation.
The doctor can make a recommendation for the
medical factors, psychologists, perhaps, for the retarded,
because a doctor is not required in retardation because it
is not a medical problem, but the doctor cannot make the
kinds of social judgments about depriving a person of liberty.
In my view and in the tradition of American law and
Pennsylvania law,in particular, commitments to mental hos­
pitals are very different from other kinds of medically
recommended treatment.
QUESTION:

How long, historically, have there been

state mental hospitals?
24R. FERLSGER:

The earliest institution, I believe,

was built in 1751 in the United States, but there were very
few until the mid-1800*s,

As they came into being, the

courts in Pennsylvania, as I indicate in my brief, made it
very clear that whether it is commitment to a private or
a public institution a guardian does not have that power.
In a number of early cases, people who had been appointing
guardians of mentally ill or mentally retarded individuals
attempted to commit their wards to a mental hospital and the
court said, "You cannot do that.

The power of a guardian does

not extend to confinement in an institution.”

QUESTION:

I suppose before there were mental

hospitals the power of a guardian to lock somebody up in an
attic wasn't questioned because that didn't involve any
action by the state and, therefore, didn't implicate the
Constitution.
MR, FERLECER:

Actually, the first commitment in

1676, which occurred in Pennsylvania, the first commitment
in the record that I know of, involved a father petitioning
Colonial Court in Pennsylvania for the commitment of his son,
and the court ordered that a blockhouse be built and that his
son be confined in that blockhouse.
In Pennsylvania, it wasn't until 1966, when the
statute challenged in this case was passed that parents had
the right to indefinitely commit their children to mental
institutions.
QUESTION:

Will you say that again.

MR, FERLEGER:

Certainly.

Not until 1966, when

the statute,challenged before and today in this case, was
passed,' did parents have the power to indefinitely sign
their children into mental institutions,
QUESTION:

In Pennsylvania.

MR. FERLEGER:

In Pennsylvania,

Pennsylvania, from the beginning, treated mental
commitment as far different from any other kind -~
QUESTION:

And prior to 1966, what was the

42
procedure for the so-called voluntary admission of somebody
who had not reached adulthood?
MR. FERLSGER:

For the mentally retarded, sworn

affidavits were required and there was an application pro­
cedure that required doctors to submit something to a magis­
trate or a judge for the mentally ill, back a while ago.

The

procedure has changed over the years.
The first hint of the voluntary commitment by
parents came in 1961, when the Legislature allowed parents
to sign their children in for up to 30 days, after which a
court commitment was required.

There has always been, in

Pennsylvania, a balancing between the individual's interests
and the parents' interests, with the parent only getting this
awesome power not more than twelve years ago.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume at

1:00 o'clock.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock, the Court recessed
to reconvene at 1:00 o'clock, p.m., the same day.)

43
AFTERNOON SESSION
{1:02}
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continua,

Counsel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP DAVID FERLEGER, ESQ., (Resumed)
ON BEHALF CP THE APPELLEES.
MR. FERLEGER:

May it please the Court:

1 would like to speak to two issues that came up

earlier, then refer briefly to several other Issues that I
believe are important.
First, the general issue in this case is how to
protect children, people who are likely to not be able to
protect themselves, when their parents may be unable, either
by inclination or by information

or lack of information ~~

to protect them.
It is my view that the procedures ordered bsr the
lower court are a process for determining whether the parents'
interes tv the parents* decision, coincides x^ifch what the
needs of the children, a re.
So, in effect, we do have a process by which that
determination, weeding out the proper decisions by parents
from the improper decisions, a process by which that can be
d„one.
QUESTION:

You haven’t talked yet, Counsel, about

whether the net effect, the ultimate effect, of this might

be more damaging to children, bo fcake them through this
gauntlet of an adversary proceeding, in which, the very
procedure itself puts them in opposition to their parents.
Of course, with a serious emotional condition, they may
already be in that posture.

The question is x^hat evidence is

there here, if any, in the record about whether that would be
a good thing for the children?
MR, FBRLEGER:

The district court found as a fact,

in its opinion at page 1081
QUESTION:
finding was.

,

1082 —

What's the evidence?

I know what the

I wanted to know what the evidence is to

support that finding or whether that is just conjecture on
the part of the court.
MR. FERLEGER:.
of the court.

It is not conjecture on the part

It is based.on the testimony of eight psychia­

trists, four for each side, in the first case, and the testi*mony on the retarded, uncontradicted, of Commissioner Glenn,
that a hearing would not be traumatizing, that there would be
little trauma, if at all, and if there would be any trauma,
of course, the presence at the hearing can be waived, the
tribunal can approve a waiver of that presence.
QUESTION:

'The presence of the child at the hearing.

MR. FBRLEGER:
. QUESTION:
What

That’s correct.

But in this context is the child —

has the child got to evaluate whether he or she

should take part in this affair or should not?
MR, FERLEGER:
would be the child’s.

If the child is able, the decision
If the child is unable, within the
?

confines of the cannons of ethics, as Mr, Crcmerty referred
to, the waiver would be made by the counsel or advocate with
the approval of the tribuna.
The other question, Mr. Chief Justice, you raised
earlier on the role of counsel in these hearings.

Over the

lunch break we read the opinion of the lower court, and the
lower court opinion makes it very clear in Footnote 47, page
1079, that the advocate has to protect the child’s interests,
rather than the all-or-nothing get the child out of the
institution.

The function of the advocate, according to the

lower court, is to advance the child's best interests.
QUESTION:

' It Is the potential for deprivation of

liberty that calls into existence the right to have an advo­
cate in the first place; isn't it?
MR. FERLEGER:

Yes, it is.

The experts indicate —

and I believe the record is clear — that when you are
thinking about Institutionalizing someone you end up weighing
the risks and the harms that are inherent in every Institu­
tionalization, against the potential benefits.

And the

advocate would have the responsibility for advocating
whatever the best interests of the child would be.
QUESTION:.

Is that all that much different than a

46
lawyer for a defendant in a criminal case advising fche
client to plead guilty?
MR, FERLEGER:

I think a lawyer in certain

criminal cases probably has the obligation to advise fche
client to plead guilty or not.

However, in fche criminal

area, X think that there is more of an obligation to avoid
fche criminal sanctions than fche lower court put on fche
advocate here.

The responsibilities placed on the advocate

here'-- X think the fact that the lower court isn't requiring
counsel, indicates that it is more of a best interest test,
rafcher than a looking one way advocacy kind of thing.
QUESTION:

Now, when you get to this point in this

kind of an enterprise, you will have decided that the
parents are not to make the decision.

That's a given factor

here, isn't it, that the parents are not to make this
decision unilaterally?
MR. FERLEGER:

Not unilaterally.

QUESTION: ;■ .Having taken fche parents out of the
decision-making process, then some doctors have presumably
advised certain treatment and certain procedures and to go
to a hearing *■>«• We are taking them out, at least temporarily,
taking them out until it has been subjected to an adversaryproceeding or inquiry.
MR. FERLEGER:

No, we are not taking fche parents

out, we are not taking fche doctors out.

We are bringing them

47
together.
QUESTION:

Their decision isn't going to control.

The decision of the parents is out. . I don't mean the
physical presence, obviously.
be able to decide this.

The parents are not going to

Novi, then, the doctors who have

been counseling the family, they aren't going to be able to
decide it alone.

Now, you appoint an advocate and you say

the advocate looks the whole situation over and then he
decides what's best for the children.

Isn't that making the

advocate virtually the judge in many aspects?
MR. FERLEGER:

The case would be presented to the

mutual tribunal, itfhich would have to approve any waiver of
the hearing.

That could be if everyone agreed, if the child,

parents, doctors, advocate all agreed that it was befit for
the child to be institutionalized there wouldn't be any need
for any full kind of hearing at all.
QUESTION:

Aren't you giving the advocate here a

greater role than you are giving either the parents or the
medical adviser?.
MR. FERLEGER:

No, because the unbiased tribunal

has to confirm any waiver of any rights.
QUESTION:

Is the unbiased tribunal necessarily

a judicial one?
MR. FERLEGER:

No, not at all.

The lower court

made it very clear that it -was not determining what sort of

48
tribunal it has to be, simply neutral and unbiased,
QUlESTXON:

Is there a right of appeal?

MR. FERLEGER:

The lower court did not discuss any

right of appeal,
QUESTION:

What's your opinion 3s to the con­

stitutional requirement of an appeal?
MR, FERLEGER:

The state, when the court asked it

to give its views on what kind of hearing would be required»
suggests that an administrative hearing, subject to appeal
through the administrative and then court process that we
have in Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with that?

MR. FERLEGER:

1 think that would be constitutionally

sufficient, yes.
QUESTION:

Do you think it would be constitutionally

required?
MR, FERLEGER:
QUESTION:

To have an appeal -~

An appeal as well as your initial

hearing.
MR. FERLEGER:

No, I don't think it would.

Two other points.

First, the district court's

opinion is very clear, as is its order in the record in the
■case, that this case only involves commitment to institutions,
not to group homes, not to community care.

It came up in the

May 10, "73, hearing, it came up in our motion for a class

49
action which said "facilities" means institutions for resi­
dential treatment.

It came up in the court's order specifying

that only evidence relating to institutional confinement was
admissible and it is absolutely clear we are only talking
about In-patient Institutions for residential care.
QUESTION:

1

take it you do agree that the advocate

becomes, in this setting, a very important factor.
MR. FERLEGER:

Yes*

and I think that the responsi­

bilities of the advocate :ls spelled out. in the district court'
opinion, along with the waiver provisions and the neutral
tribunal's oversight of the whole process.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

May I ask what folks in the mental

MR. FERLEGER:

The Federal law, under the Develop­

mental Disabilities Act, requires every state to have a
protection and advocacy system for the retarded.

For the

mentally ill, many states, such as New Jersey which filed an
amicus brief here, New.York has Mental Health Information

There are many legal and■non-legal advocacy groups

existing in the country,mental health associations, national
associations for retarded citizens —
QUESTION:

My question really was: How do those in

the mental health field get special training in advocacy?
Who gives them that?
MR» FERLEGER:

I, myself, have participated on

faculty -- various continuing education kinds of proceedings
to help teach people how to be advocates, in terns of the
legal rights of the patients.

Are those citations in your brief?

MR. FERLEGER:

No, they are not at all.

to receive proper treatment, the least restrictive treatment
and protection of their rights.

Are these just with respect to re­

QUESTION:

This Federal system wouldn't prevent

No, not at all, but it would permit

Pennsylvania to use the so-called PSA system, protection and

Is this person a sort of ombudsman for

There is a staff, there is a

system of using and training volunteers as well as profes­
sionals to provide independent legal advocacy.

The Federal

statute requires that the state mechanism have the means to
institute legal action, as well as simply to be an ombudsman.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferleger, before you sit down, just

roughly how many of these applications for commitment are
there in —** for a year, or something like that?

How big a

53
problem are we talking about administratively?
MR, FERLEGER: In Pennsylvania?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, FERLEGER:

In Pennsylvania, as I recall, the

record below on the mentally ill, when we had it from zero to
eighteen, there were,during the year, three or four hundred
commitments in the whole State of Pennsylvania of children
from zero to eighteen.

Nationally, 60$ of commitments of

children are children from fifteen to seventeen.

So that,

we are probably talking about a rate of relatively few
commitments.

For the retarded, many institutions, in

Pennsylvania no longer accept new commitments.

The insti­

tution where Plaintiff George S. is has not accepted any
commitment since 1971, except under a court order.

As

Mr. Watkins indicated, states are retreating more and more
from the use of institutions.
QUESTION:

I am trying to figure out how many

such people would be required to do the -- I assume they

Mr. Watkins, you have two minutes left.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP NORMAN J. WATKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANTS
MR. WATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the C ourt:
I have.but four points to make.

55
First, in response to two questions, I believe
delivered by Mr. Justice White.

This Court’s opinion in

Flagg Brothers was decided May 15th, and the opinion of the
lower court was rendered on May 25th.
QUESTION: Bo you know whether Flagg Brothers was
brought to their attention?
MR. WATKINS:

Unfortunately, ray brief was filed-.,

well before this Court's decision in Flagg Brothers, and I
don't recall whether or not my opponent brought it to the
Court’s attention.
QUESTION:

What do you think about Flagg Brothers?

MR, WATKINS:

I think Flagg Brothers, with respect,

to private license facilities, indicates that there is no
state action

Involved.

QUESTION:

In this case?

MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

In this case.

Do you think the district court was

wrong?
MR. WATKINS:

That's correct.

Secondly, I believe, Mr. Justice White, you" inquired
as to whether or not Pennsylvania inspects these private
facilities.

Pennsylvania Lav/ requires at 62 P.S, 911 that

an inspection be conducted at least annually, as to the
conditions in the facility.
The third point I wish to make is a clarification

56
of a question addressed by Mr. Chief Justice Burger on
whether or not any — what the condition of Commissioner
Glenn's testimony or conclusions was with respect to the
erroneous admissions of children in Pennsylvania.'
The fact of the matter is that not one of the
experts that testified in this case examined any of the
children involved in this case, and the record reflects this
very clearly.

For example, I cite 495A of the Appendix,

where Dr. Finer candidly admits that he was not familiar
with any of the conditions in Pennsylvania.

635A, Dr.

Messenger admits that the only thing that he. was familiar
, with at the time of his testimony was that which was provided
by counsel dealing with the legal process Involved, and,
finally 1030A, where Commissloner Glenn indicated that her
only familiarity was with the regulations that was provided
to her prior to her testimony.

i
Finally, I would only submit that the coverage
of the lower court’s order with respect to community based
facilities is clearly addressed in my Reply Brief, the green
covered brief, and I defer to that.
Thank you, very much,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

The case is submitted,
(Whereupon, at 1:19 o'clock, p„m„, the case was
submitted,)
