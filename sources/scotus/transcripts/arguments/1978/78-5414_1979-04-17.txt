PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Wolston v. Reader's Digest.
I think you may proceed whenever you are ready,
Mr. Dicksteln.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY DICKSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The petitioner in this case is Ilya Wolston, who
is the nephew of Jack and Myra Soble, admitted Soviet
espionage agents.

Following the Sobles' arrest in 1957 and

their later plea of guilty to espionage charges, Wolston
received and failed to comply with a grand jury subpoena.
Following commencement of the trial on the resulting contempt
charge, Wolston pleaded guilty, received a one-year suspended
sentence conditioned on his future cooperation with federal
authorities and was placed on three years probation.
Newspaper stories relating to Wolston!s failure to
appear, his contempt hearing, his plea and his sentence were
published between July 15 and August 14, 1958.

As the

District Court observed, however, Wolston had led a thoroughly
t

private existence and he was generally unknown until his
fai?i.ure to appear before the grand jury became public
knowledge.

And after the flury of publicity attending his

a
conviction ceased, he apparently succeeded for the most part
in resuming his private life.
The defamatory statements at issue here are found
in a book entitled ”KGB: The Secret Work of Soviet Agents,”
which was written by John Barron, an employee of the Reader’s
Digest Association, Inc.

It was published in 197^ by the

Reader's Digest Press and republished by two book clubs and
in paperback by Bantam Books.
The defamatory statements in the book identified
petitioner as a Soviet agent undifferentiated from the
Rosenbergs, William Remington, Judith Coplon, Harry Gold and
other infamous figures of Soviet espionage.

A footnote to

the identification of Wolston as a Soviet agent can be read
to mean that petitioner had been indicted for espionage as
well as convicted of contempt of court.
Following petitioner’s filing of this action, a
diversity action in the District of Columbia, the author of
KGB was deposed.

He testified that his identification of

Wolston as a Soviet agent was predicated upon a I960 FBI
report —
QUESTION:

Mr. Dickstein, could I ask you the same

question I asked counsel in the case preceding this, then the
source of law is District of Columbia law?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

The source of law insofar as federal

Issues are not concerned is, of course, the District of

0

Columbia.
QUESTION:

The basic right rises out of District of

Columbia lav??
MR. DICKSTEIN:

That Is correct.

Barron also testified that prior to and while he was
writing KGB, he was completely familiar with a book entitled
"My Ten Years as a Counterspy," which was written by Boris
Morros and published in 1959.

In this book, Morros recounts

that Soble has Identified his nephew Wolston as Slava, a
person who had purportedly furnished Soble with information.
Morros5 book referred to Wolston's sentence for contempt of
court, but the book concluded, that he knew nothing about
Wolston's activities except that which Soble "a confirmed
liar" had told him.
Barron testified that notwithstanding his authoriza­
tion to invest as much time in research as necessary on the
book, the full backing of the Reader's Digest organization,
the assignment of a full-time researcher, his use of the
worldwide research facilities of the Reader's Digest, and
cooperation by the FBI and other federal agencies which had
been assured and which he received.
In the over four years that this book was In
preparation, he made no attempt to verify the information set
out in the book concerning Wolston and relied, he said,
solely on the FBI report.

With regard to the footnote reference in the book
which the District Court and the Court of Appeals both agreed
appeared to state falsely that Wolston had .been indicted for
espionage, Barron testified that he knew that Wolston had
not been indicted but that the persons to which the note
referred, which included Wolston, had been convicted of
espionage or falsifying information or perjury and/or contempt
charges — and that I take It meant Wolston — following che
espionage indictment of other people.
In support of the defendant’s motion for summary
judgment, Barron submitted an affidavit in which he says:

"I

was confident upon publication of KGB that the book as a
whole and each and every statement in it were true, and I was
aware of no fact that tended to make me doubt the truth of
the book or of any statement in it.”

He added that "At no

time have I been aware of any fact that would give me reason
to doubt the FBI report or any statement in it."
QUESTION;

Isn’t it the rule on summary judgment

that where a party defendant makes an affidavit that he not
only —- you have a right to depose him but that the District
Court has to resolve issues against him If they are triable
issues of fact?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

That is the normal rule, of course,

but that is not the rule that was followed by the courts
below.

In fact, that is not the rule which appears to pertain

7
in the District of Columbia, where there is a special law
that deals with motions for summary judgment in matters in­
volving libel.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the basis for any different

rule in a libel case?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

It seems to have been suggested that

the very existence, persistence, if you would, of a law suit
which can otherwise be nipped in the bud at an early stage
has a chilling, an Inhibiting effect upon the press which is
forced to continue to defend that case through the normal
processes of trial,

and so summary judgment is encouraged in

the District of Columbia and in the Fifth Circuit as well.
That is the rule that was applied here.

Because we think it

is evidence from the record — and I will refer to this — if
inferences were drawn which could fairly have been drawn,
even if an actual malice standard were to have been applied,
a jury could have- concluded that Barron did entertain serious
doubts about the truth of the allegation, the accusation that
Wolston was a Soviet agent but went ahead and published any­
way.
The courts below did apply the actual malice stand­
ard here, purporting to follow this Court's opinions in Gertz
and Firestone.

They concluded that Wolston was a public

figure and crediting Barron's self-serving assertion they
concluded that malice could not be shown and granted summary

8
judgment for the defendants.

It is from that summary judg­

ment that we have come before this Court.
QUESTION:

Did you depose Barron?

MR. DICKSTEIN:
QUESTION:

We did in fact depose him.

And they nonetheless chose to believe In­

stat ement without a trial of fact?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

That Is correct, precisely.

The

basis for the conclusion of the courts below that Wolston

.as

a public figure subject to the actual malice standard was
that in failing to comply with the subpoena, he had volun­
tarily exposed himself to the publicity that might and did in
fact ensue.
QUESTION:

In your view, is the issue of whether or

not the person is a public figure invariably a fact issue for
a jury?

Or where would you put it in the range, since you

seem to sup;gest some special rules about First Amendment
cases ?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Your Honor, we argued in the courts

below that the question of whether one is or is not a public
figure in a close case would be a question for a jury.

We

have not raised that here and we don't argue it here because
we do not think this is a close case.

We think this is a

case In which Wolston cannot be classified as a public figure
and hence no fact issue arises which a jury would have to
consider.

9
It is possible to postulate a case, hypothesise a
case in which an individual

to whom public attention was

drawn as a. consequence of action which was contemptuous or in
any other way in violation

of criminal law, could be said to

have made a political statement by his conduct.

The case of

the Hollywood Ten is brought to mind, where in their actions
which were one and the same time held to be in contempt of
Congress, it i^as clear that they were making political state­
ment s.
If it occurred that there were fact issues and
there were ambiguities as to whether or not someone is a
public figure under those circumstances, then possibly a jury
question might be presented.

We do not think one is presented

here.
The reason why the courts below held that Wolston
was a public figure beyond any question of a doubt, I suppose,
was that they found in his actions the kind of voluntariness
which this Court they said had in mind in Gertz.

Our reading

of Gertz to the contrary was dismissed as too literall, too
restrictive.

But we submit that the significant language of

this Court’s opinions dealing with public persons simply can­
not embrace petitioner Wolston.
of achievement.

He had no fame or notoriety

Certainly he occupied no role of special

prominense in the affairs of society, nor did he attempt to
Influence society with respect to the outcome of public

10
issues.
QUESTION:

Counsel, your argument now centers on

1958 as well as on 1974, does it not?
MR. DICKSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

If you lose on the former, if he were a

public figure in ’58, have you abandoned the argument that he
ceased to be one in '74?
MR. DICKSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, we have.

Could I ask why?

You made the arguments

in the courts below?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

Upon reflection ~~ and I must say in part, at least,
persuaded by the views expressed by the courts below •— we
reached the conclusion that the rights of privacy and the
rights of defamation are so different and. apart that while it
could be argued that one who had lost his right of privacy
in 1958 would have had it restored by 1974; that in a work
of this kind, a work which is reportedly

and I suppose on

its face to be regarded — as a reflective work of history.,
if one were a public figure In 1958, one would remain a
public figure for the purpose of commenting upon those same
events in an historical work published in 1974.

So, yes,

Your Honor, we did abandon that argument.
QUESTION:

Would the passage of time also serve to

impose on the defendants a greater measure of operation in

11
the ^recklessness concept?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

We think so and certainly so.

In

fact —
QUESTION:

Haven't you lose that by abandoning your

argument?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

No, we don’t — as a matter of

fact, it is raised in our relief brief. Your Honor, because
in determining what is reasonable care, that is to be the
standard, negligence Is applicable here; or even in deter­
mining actual malice -- and the Court was very careful in
noting in St. Amant that what the definition of actual
malice would be and presumably the facts which would support
it would vary from case to case.

We think the circumstances

are particularly important.
Here where there wen an interim period between the
event and the publication of 16 years, 16 years of oppor­
tunity for reflection, and four years of writing and oppor­
tunity for determination, for research, for checking out,
for interviewing, and those opportunities were foregone.

We

believe that those circumstances demonstrate negligence in
the first instance, and we

believe that they would satisfy

the actual malice standard as well if that were the issue
here.
We do not think that one can treat this book as if
it were hot news written by the Washington Post, say, on the

12
morning of publication of the FBI report, and so we do think
there is a difference and we havene’t abandoned that.
QUESTION:

You say you filed a reply brief?

MR. DICKSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

I assume we have it.

MR. DICKSTEIN:

Being in the form of a porous case,

the reply brief was not printed.

I do not believe that the

clerk was able to print it prior to the argument.
We agree that Wolston by his actions became news­
worthy, and it is clear that if the plurality opinion in
Rosenbloom were the law, the actual malice standard would be
applicable to petitioners case.

But we believe it strains,

in fact distorts the plain meaning of this Court’s opinion in
Gertz to equate petitioner’s conduct with the inviting of
attention and public comment, which is one of the hallmarks
of a public figure.
It has been said that we read Gertz too literally,
but we think the Court meant exactly what It said in Gertz.
To invite means to welcome, to solicit, to court, to entice,
and that is what public figures indeed do, whether they are
public figures for all purposes or for single issues, for
unless they attract public attention they cannot achieve their
purpose.

And it is precisely because they purposely seek

public attention that the press is accorded more room in
dealing with them.

QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t that approach really re­

strict the public figure to those who indulge in political
speach?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Not at all.

The public issues which

I think are the concern of the eases beginning with Times v.
Sullivan and Its progeny are not necessarily limited to
political Issues.

We do not so contend and I don't think the

Court has so held.
There is a whole range of public issues which are
matters of public concern, but the focus of course is on the
activities of the plaintiff in the defamation suit, not on
the surrounding circumstances which gave rise to the defama­
tion.
There are other ways in which Wo1ston simply does
not match up to what this Court has held a public figure to
be in Gertz and Firestone.

One thing is crystal clear:

Unlik

Wally Butts and General Walker, Wolston did not command suf­
ficient continuing public interest, nor did he have sufficient
access to the means of counterargument to be able to expose
through discussion of falsehoods and fallacies of defamatory
statements.

One wonders how these falsehoods could have been

exposed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o'clock, Mr. Dickstein.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon, the Court was
recessed until 1:00 o'clock p.m.)

14
AFTERNOON SESSION -- 1:00 0«CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dlckstein, you are

going to rest at this point and reserve?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

I will reserve the rest of my time

for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Buckley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BUCKLEY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BUCKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In Gertz, this Court stated that public figures are
persons whose actions invite attention and comment in the
context of a public controversy,
QUESTION:

That isn’t the only thing, the only

definition though, is it?
MR. BUCKLEY:
other definitions.

That’s correct, Your Honor, there are

For example, there are some individuals

who have attained a degree of prominence in society generally
who may be public figures merely by virtue of their status.
But there are other individuals who have engaged in conduct
which invites if not compells public attention and comment in
the context of a public controversy and therefore become
public figures by virtue of that voluntary conduct.
In this case, Wolston s conduct fit that description

15
precisely.

He failed to comply with a subpoena issued by a

grand jury investigating Soviet espionage.
QUESTION:

In what year was that?

MR. BUCKLEY:

In 1958.

That conduct occurred in

the midst of a public controversy over Soviet espionage and
that conduct In fact invited and resulted in attention and
comment.

Nov;, the larger controversy —
QUESTION:

Mr. Buckley, would that be true of any

criminal defendant then, that the press is free to libel or
defame him and is subject only to liability under the public
figure standards?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think that is generally the case,

that a person who engaged in criminal conduct will result in
being a public figure at least for a limited range of issues
relating to his conviction.
QUESTION:

In this case, however —

Well, what if he is acquitted?

MR. BUCKLEY:

Your Honor, if he is acquitted, then

it poses a more difficult question.

Of course, in this case

the citation for contempt resulted in » plea of guilty to
the charge.

If a person is, however, acquitted, then there

would still remain the question of whether he engaged in
voluntary conduct which invited attention and comment.
QUESTION:

You said he Is a public figure for a

narrow range of Issues.

You wouldn't suggest that a person

who is convicted of burglary or an armored car robbery in

16
1958 Is necessarily a public figure if he is accused of doing
the same thing in 1979.

He has never been heard of since.

The only thing is he is accused of robbing another armored
truck in 1979.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, I would say, Your Honor, that

he would not be a public figure for the purposes of comment
for —

QUESTION:

Although he might be with respect to the

'58 episode.
MR. BUCKLEY:

That’s right, he would not be for

purposes of a statement that he was a Soviet agent, as in
this case.

He may not be for some unrelated criminal conduct.

He certainly would be for the criminal conduct for which he
was convicted.

And in this case —-

QUESTION:

You mean be remains a public figure if

he were accused of being a Soviet agent today, he would still
be a public figure?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think in this case, of course, one

need not reach that result.
QUESTION:

I know, but your statement a while ago

Indicated that, yes, he would be a public figure.
MR. BUCKLEY:

If the statement was to the effect

that he was in the fifties and remains today, I would submit
that he eould be a public figure for those purposes because
the controversy is an on-going one.

Now —

17
QUESTION:

Well, he has never been heard of since.

MR, BUCKLEY:

Of course, again in this case it is

limited to historical comments on what he was in the 1950’s,
QUESTION:

How many people are arrested in New York

City in any one day?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Your Honor, I have no idea.

I would

Would they all be public figures?

MR. BUCKLEY:

I think they would all be public

figures for the purposes -QUESTION:

MR. BUCKLEY:

And the reason that --

MR. BUCKLEY:

First of all, it requires conduct

The public controversy is that a man is

MR. BUCKLEY:

That's right, and the controversy

revolves around the conduct for which -QUESTION:

In my case, in my hypothetical, there

is no controversy, he pleaded guilty.
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

He pleaded guilty, right.

That takes the controversy out of it,

doesn’t it?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, by a guilty plea he has con­

fessed at being engaged in voluntary conduct that was
criminal.
QUESTION:

So he becomes a public figure?

19
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And nobody ever heard of him.

I don't think it makes any difference,

for the following reasons, that —

MR. BUCKLEY:

According to —- let me say to begin

QUESTION:

I assume his mother and father knew about

him, but -—
MR. BUCKLEY:

Obviously the police were aware of

his actions because that resulted In his arrest and eventu­
ally of his conviction.

Let me say that in this case, we are

not dealing with a totally obscure figure because as a result
of Wolston's conviction for contempt in 1958, he received at
that time a fair degree of publicity and at least fifteen
newspapers published in two cities at the time and a book
written by Boris Morros in 1959 and in an FBI report published
in I960, all of which discussed his failure to appear before
the grand Jury and his guilty plea to contempt, all show the
notoriety which Wolston gained for himself by his unlawful
conduct.
QUESTION:

Would you say that was an instance of

20
his injecting himself into a controversy intentionally?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Yes, I would say so, for this reason,

that Wolston became an activist for the purpose of insuring
that he did not appear before that grand jury on July 1, 1953.
Initially, of course, he received a subpoena, but that is
hardly a basis for complaint on his part, of course, because,
as this Court has held, the law and the grand jury as its
embodiment is entitled to every man’s evidence.
not compel Wolston to do what he in fact did.

But that did
He had two

lawful alternatives, to comply with the subpoena or to move
to quash the subpoena if he thought it to be unreasonable,
oppressive or in violation of any constitutional or statutory
right.
QUESTION:

If he complied with the subpoena, he

might get a lot more publicity than if he refused to comply,
isn’t that a possibility?
MR. BUCKLEY:

But his conduct could not be said to

be, as it can fairly be here., to have been of such a nature
as to have invited defamatory comments as to have opened the
door to speculation on the basis for his refusal to comply
with the subpoena.
QUESTION:
comments.”

Now you use the phrase ”invite defamatory

Who invites defamatory comments?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think whan one engages in conduct

which inevitably attracts by its very nature public comment

and attention, and especially when that conduct is criminal
conduct, that it invites people to discuss his actions, par­
ticularly where the conduct is committed in the midst of a
federal investigation into Soviet espionage.

It sparks the

public debate, it arouses the public*s Interest, it runs the
risk of closer public scrutiny and, of course, even more
than if he had mounted a rostrum, it constitutes on his part
a relinquishment of some measure of his interest in the
protection of his own. good name, it opens the door to —
QUESTION:

You really mean it invites discussion,

not defamation?
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

I well, I would say that no —

It doesn't Invite somebody to tell a lie,

does it?
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

I would say your observation —

That doesn't invite somebody to tell a

lie, does it?
MR. BUCKLEY:
is true.

I would say Your Honor's observation

In every case of a public figure, including someone

who runs for office, in no sense does he invite lies, but he
is nonetheless a public figure.

So here in this case,

Wolston engaged in conduct that bears all the earmarks of
public figure status under Gertz, conduct which attracted
public attention in the midst of a public controversy, which
ran the rusk of closer public scutiny, which constituted a

22
relinquishment of some measure of his interest in protecting
his own good name and which Invariably opened the door to
speculation on the reasons for his refusal to comply with the
subpoena, including the possible and related inference that
he was in fact a spy.
QUESTION:

Now, he is an American citizen, is he

not ?
MR'. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, he is.

Now, if you were to say that an American

citizen was asked to help in an inquiry into foreign espion­
age, refuses to assist the United States government, then I
could understand your argument that he has at least — if
invited is not the right word, he must take into account that
that wil.1 attract a lot of attention.
MR. BUCKLEY:

That I can understand.

Certainly a person who engages in

criminal conduct to refuse to obey a subpoena Invites comment
on his actions.

That is an invariable consequence of his

refusal to appear and it certainly was in this case.

After

all, if one pauses for a moment to look at the context in
which this conduct occurred, the FBI had been engaged in a
ten-year1 investigation of Soviet espionage.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly that wasn't public,

MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

The Sobles —

It was at the time of the arrest --

The FBI’s probing was published?

uncle, were indicted for espionage, entered pleas of guilty,

The stage had

The subject of Soviet espionage

by the middle of 195$ had achieved a prominence in the public’s
mind.

After all. It did concern national security.

His

failure to appear was the climax of an unsuccessful 15-month
effort by the grand jury to obtain his testimony.

Now —

2-4

QUESTION:

Well, it sounds like that is the Metro­

media plurality test, if whatever attracts public attention
makes somebody a public figure.
MR. BUCKLEY:

No, for this reason, that we are not

relying here only on the fact that this conduct attained
publicity but on the fact that the conduct by its nature in­
variably attracted, invited and compelled comment and atten­
tion.

After all, there is the clear language of Gertz that

public figures are persons who invite attention and comment
in public controversies.
QUESTION:

Now --

But I would have thought that meant a

voluntary — that they deliberately invited.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, let’s examine that.

I think

the position taken by petitioner here is that to be a public
figure it is not enough to have engaged in conduct attracting
by its very nature attention and comments in a controversy
but to have desired the publicity as well,

That is I believe

the nub of his theory.
Let’s look at it from two standpoints.

Saddling the press with

proving what the causative or primary motive was in engaging

25
in that conduct I would submit does not promote the constitu­
tional values involved.
QUESTION:

It is a dicy task to determine actual

malice under the New York Times standards too, isn’t it?
MR. BUCKLEY:

That’s right, but I think here I

don’t think that important distinctions in the measure of
constitutional protection afforded free speech should turn on
so slippery an enterprise.

But let me take it to a different

stage, which is let’s look at it in terms of the two values
or two interests accommodated by the public figure doctrine.
Now, what this theory would require is dividing a
class of libel claims, all of whom took conduct which invited
and attracted public attention and controversy and comment
in a controversy into two subclasses which would depend on
the method by which they used to effect the controversy or
to attain the notoriety.
For example, the- division would be between voluntary
conduct which purposely seeks notoriety and voluntary conduct
which inevitably by its nature attracts notoriety, betx^een
open advocacy of a particular result and conduct which in­
evitably affects or has that same result.
So Wolston here says in his brief that he will be
a public figure if he had mounted a rostrum and argued
against his grand jury appearance, but that he shouldn’t be
if he merely engaged In a contempt, precluding his grand jury

26
appearance.

The first interest accommodated by the public

figure doctrine is the public’s need to know.

How is that

need to know any less in one case than in any other?

The

citizen in becoming informed about Soviet espionage has as
much a need to know about someone such as Wolston who commits
a contemptuous act precluding the grand .jury from obtaining
his testimony as it would about Wolston if he merely advocated
against it.

Indeed, the need in this case would be greater

because he didn't just talk about it, he did something about
it.
QUESTION:

But precisely that same dichotomy is in­

volved in cases of libel defendants with twenty newspapers
who all publish the same story.

The libel plaintiff is

equally damaged by all twenty of them.

But if it is pub­

lished with actual malice, there cen be recovery; if it is
published without actual malice, there can’t be, and yet the
good name is equally tarnished regardless of the motive.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, here in both instances by the

same degree the conduct engaged in by the public actor,
either in mounting a rostrum or in engaging in conduct,
criminal conduct which attracts publicity, is the same.

That

is, the public's need to know is the same and there is no
reason to draw a line between the two.

In fact, the need to

know is greater in the case where one speaks about pure con­
duct than in the case where one speaks about pure advocacy.

27

The other interest to be accommodated under the
public figure standard is the reputational interests of the
public figure which are regarded as less than the wholly pri­
vate person because he has committed conduct which has
created an enhanced likelihood of defamatory statements being
made about him because he has invited indeed the very types
of comments about which he now complains.
Now, surely that is true whether Wolston mounts a
rostrum to argue against his grand jury appearance as it
would be if he in fact took contemptuous conduct precluding
his grand jury appearance.

In both instances, to the same

degree the conduct creates an enhanced likelihood of defama­
tory statements, it runs the risk of closer public scutiny
and —
QUESTION:

Mr. Buckley, your analogy to mounting a

rostrum prompts me to ask this question.

It is sort of

absurd to think about anybody getting on a rostrum to argue
against complying with a subpoena.

That isn't the kind of

public debate one gets into when he gets a legal process
served on him.

I notice the language in Gerts describing

the public figure emphasises being drawn into a public con­
troversy, and in the last sentence is "he assumes special
prominence in the resolution of public question."

What is

the public controversy or the public question that this man
had prominence in, or something that could be resolved by the

28
public?
MR. BUCKLEY:

The public controversy was the contro­

versy over Soviet espionage and the actions -QUESTION:

What was the controversy?

Everybody is

There aren’t pros and cons about

that, are there?
MR, BUCKLEY:

Well, I don't think that the term

necessarily means that it is limited to some matter that is
about to be put to a referendum.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t it supposedly a controversy

over a debatable issue on which people in the public might
disagree?

Otherwise, what is the purpose of this whole area

of free speech?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Under that statement, it qualifies as

well because in all instances, particularly in this instance,
where we had a ten-year investigation by the FBI into Soviet
espionage, actions by the grand jury standing well over a year and a half, there was a controversy over the subject of
the —QUESTION:

What was the public controversy?

MR. BUCKLEY:

The controversy was over the pro­

priety of the actions by the public officials running the in­
vestigation, by the grand jury conducting it, it was in every
sense something that related to the matters of ■—
QUESTION:

The public controversy over whether the

29
Investigation was being conducted properly?
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And what did he have to do with that

controversy?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Because he became an activist for the

purpose of insuring that the grand jury did not obtain his
testimony regarding Soviet espionage and did so by his own
voluntary conduct.
QUESTION:

Going back a bit, I don't have the time

frame in mind, but in the middle fifties was there a great
deal of controversy, public controversy over the methods be­
ing used to investigate Soviet espionage —
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

— and borderline conduct?

MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Certainly, sir.

Is that the kind of controversy you are

talking about?
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

Let me say to begin with --

Criticism of the FBI, for example, and

of the CIA?
MR. BUCKLEY:

That certainly could be.

Let me say

to begin with though that any time the government takes actions
particularly in the context of an investigation of Soviet
espionage, there is a matter pertaining to the affairs of
government about which the public has a right to be informed.

30

Now, in Firestone this Court focused on the meaning of the
phrase "public controversy" and the Court held that a matri­
monial dispute is not a public controversy, under the reason­
ing that —
QUESTION:

Well, it wasn't that broad, but in the

setting of that case —
MR, BUCKLEY:

That's right, the dissolution of a

marriage —
QUESTION:

That particular case was not a public

controversy.
MR. BUCKLEY:

That's correct.

And the Court's ra­

tionale was that at heart this was a dispute between two
spouses that had only been brought into the court because of
the requirements of the state, and that a dispute between two
spouses in a marriage is a private domestic affair that does
not qualify as public controversy.
Now, in this case there is a clear difference, the
commission of criminal conduct by Wolston,if there was not
already a controversy on-going, created a new one, that is a
controversy involving himself on the one side and the federal
government on the other.
QUESTION:

How public was it?

Everybody didn't know

about it.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, there were fifteen newspapers

that were published at the time —

one other one that was involved.
MR. BUCKLEY:

gation.

Many of them were well known.

QUESTION:

It is ironic to think of someone trying

to conceal his activities as a spy from being a public
figure.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, I don't think it is ironic at

all.
QUESTION:

And that is why he did not want to

testify.
MR. BUCKLEY:

It is because espionage inevitably

invites and attracts publicity, but it must be done covertly.
If one is going to steal the plans to the hydrogen bomb, he
hardly goes about it by walking in .in broad daylight into the
Pentagon and looking for the plans.

But nevertheless, it is

because of the recognition that if someone knew what you were
up to, the press would indeed bo interested in it by its very
definition —

MR. BUCKLEY:

Yes, I have.

I ask you because I had

not read it

As you know, in

that reply brief the distinction is made between the loss of

33
privacy and the public figure, and it may well be that a
person who commits a criminal offense or allegedly commits
one or somebody who resists a subpoena loses any claim he may
have to privacy with respect to publicity of that fact,
publicity emanating from his conduct.

But does it follow —

and that loss of publicity serves to satisfy at least one of
the interests that you have described to us.

Does it neces­

sarily follow or should it, that loss of privacy is equiva­
lent to becoming a public figure?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I don't think in each and every case,

someone who is a public figure under the privacy law Is so,
for purposes of libel law as well.

But certainly in the con­

text of this case, I would submit that the results should be
the same because someone like Author Barron in writing a
book on the KGB and in discussing the more recent disclosures
concerning the activities of that organization has a compell­
ing need to refer to the history of the controversy, to the
background of how these present events evolved.
QUESTION:

In fact —

And to be sure, when the petitioner re­

sisted the subpoena and didn’t appear, there could have
been legitimate reporting of that fact and he would have had
no right to hold anybody liable for reporting it because he
had lost his privacy pro tonto.

But does it follow, does it

necessarily follow at all or that it is at all equivalent
that he is thereby a public figure?

34
MR» BUCKLEY:

I don’t think it follows in each and

every case., but if one looks at the earmarks of public
figure status identified in the Gertz opinion, 7. think that
in this case it follows, at least with respect to someone
who engages in a criminal
QUESTION:

And one can understand that if a person

becomes a candidate for governor or mayor or president or
indeed if he is elected to any one of those offices, he is
a public figure and he does invite adverse criticism, some of
which will oe false probably and he knows it is going to come
and that is a true public figure.

But if someone simply is

arrested for robbery or held in contempt for disobedience of
a subpoena, he loses his privacy but it certainly doesns't
follow that he becomes a public figure and can reasonably
expect or be said to have invited adverse and perhaps false
defamatory comment.
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think he has because the conduct by

its very nature attracts attention and notoriety, criminal
conduct —
QUESTION:

And you are reporting the fact.

MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, these are the earmarks of

public figure status under Gertz.
QUESTION:

Running for office is quite a different

thing, isn't it, or holding public office?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, he creates the enhanced

35
possibility by his criminal conduct of the very types of com­
ments about which he now complains, and just as much as if he
had run for office to have an effect upon the governmental
process.

The failure to appear before a federal grand jury

in response to a subpoena has a direct effect, much more than
it did if he had mounted the rostrum and —QUESTION:

So you say they are basically equivalent

as far as the law and the Constitution goes, resisting a
subpoena and running for the Dresidency?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I wouldn’t say that in order to

qualify for a public figure one has to almost be a public
official.

But in this context, 1 think it was sufficient.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ralph Nader is a public figure but

doesn't hold any public office.
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

What if just an ordinary citizen, a

secretary, a clerk in the government. is accosted on the
street by a. policeman who wants to arrest them and has no
reason and some opinions of

some courts have said that a

citizen may resist an unlawful arrest, and that person does
resist the arrest and gets his name in the paper and on the
i
evening television news, does that make him a public figure?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Well, it would depend on whether he

in fact engaged in criminal conduct.

That's what this case

is all about, commission of criminal conduct.

QUESTION:

Just what I have said to you

MR. BUCKLEY:

I would like to bring you back to my

Brother Stewart's point, a very simple question:

thing was published in 1970 and he has now gone in a monastery,
what would happen on this —
MR. BUCKLEY:

If the public controversy was still

QUESTION:

Would that be the determining factor,

whether the controversy was still alive?
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

If the comment pertained to --

The comment pertains solely to what he

did in 1950.
MR. BUCKLEY:

He is a public figure for those purif

poses, yes.
.QUESTION:

And then what is published in 1970 is

protected even though in 1970 he is in a monastery?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think it Is impossible to write a

37
book such as KGB without referring to the history of the
activities of that agency, and certainly I think it would
not make sense in that regard to have on every page the
constitutional standard varying back and forth depending on
the time period in which the conduct or the comment refers
to.
QUESTION:

But you are libeling, you are injuring

a man who is a private figure.
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

He is a public figure.

In 1970 he is in a monastery, it is

rather private.
MR. BUCKLEY:

He is still a public figure for the

limited range of issues relating to his earlier conduct.
QUESTION:

That is your position?

MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

That is.

Mr. Buckley, would you say he is a

public figure if he hadn’t been convicted for contempt?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think that would create a much

more difficult question, because

1 am not saying he neces­

sarily would not be, because the criminal law imposes
standards that are different than those imposed for deter­
mining whether someone :Ls a public figure.

For example,

and still be a public figure and —

I would submit for a range of issues relating to possible
reasons why he did not comply with the subpoena, one pos­
sible inference being, of course, that he was a Soviet spy
and this conduct occurred in the context of a major contro­
versy over Soviet espionage.

Let me say that there is no

contention here that Wolston was the prime actor in the
entire controversy, but he was at least a supporting actor
who was starring in his own sub-plot with a script he
largely authored by his own contempt and therefore became
part of a larger drama,

Nov;, what if having been convicted

either by a government employee going home from -work and

I think it does.

is he a non-public figure?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Not necessarily.

MR. BUCKLEY:

But we are dealing with something

near to your case, the criminal conduct that you have de­
scribed .
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

I think that —

Well, he certainly can’t be in and out

as a public figure.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Always the question is what was the

underlying voluntary conduct.

It may have been criminal or

non-criminal. If It was criminal, I would submit there is a
strong indication that that conduct, criminal conduct by
Its nature attracts public attention and comment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Buckley, it seems to me that you

have spent a good deal of your time defending an issue that
is not before us, as I understand it.

You don't have to

defend the position that anyone convicted of any crime at
any time becomes a public figure.
MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I don’t.

As I understand your brief and as I

understood the opinion of the District Court and the Court
of Appeals, this man became a public figure In the opinion
of those courts only because he was convicted of contempt
In the context of the great furor in this country that ex­
isted at that time with respect to Communist espionage.
Now, why don’t you confine your position to that?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Your Honor, I was trying to be

H2

helpful to the Court, members of the Court who wanted to
broaden the question under examination.

But the whole

point of this is that this was not routine crime as all
of the hypotheticals put involved but, rather, real major
controversy involving a ten-year FBI investigation, a grand
jury that had handed down a series of indictments against
others for espionage.
QUESTION:
question.

Mr. Buckley, let met just ask one

I realize your opponent has pretty much abandoned

the argument, but on the question of the time gap between
when the conduct occurred and when the book was written, do
you think it is appropriate to have the same standard of
care for the writer who has to meet a deadline as it is for
historians?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think so, because -- especially

with respect to —
QUESTION:

But historians should equally have the

same latitude to be really make notice of falsehood before
he has to be careful about what he says about it.
MR. BUCKLEY:

I think for two reasons.

First of

all, the public’s need to know is the same.
QUESTION:

Well, would that serve the public’s

need to know or would it serve the public’s need to know to
say, well, if you are going to write a history, be careful?
MR.BUCKLEY:

Well, in writing — few things are

43
pure history»

The KGB is not pure history.

Some of it

involves more recent activities of the KGB.

Should one

delay publication of this hot news in a sense about the
more recent activities because one has to snend more time
investigating under a different standard of liability the
history of the controversy, I don't think that makes sense
because —
QUESTION:

Well, he had four years to write this

book, didn’t he?
MR. BUCKLEY:

He did, four years In writing the

book and his reliance was placed upon an official report of
the FBI, the accuracy of which had never been called Into
question.
QUESTION:
gesting that.

Well, maybe he wasn’t — I am not sug­

Maybe they were totally

had good defense

i

there.

But just on the question of the standard of the

author, does it really seem reasonable to say that an
historian should have the same latitude xvhen he has plenty
of time to research and presumably writes something that has
a stamp of careful research on it as opposed to the reporter
who has to meet a deadline and get in before 4:10 or what­
ever the time the story has to be filed?
MR, BUCKLEY:

Well, In the present context there

were more recent activities of the KGB itself.
QUESTION:

This wasn’t a recent activity.

MR. BUCKLEY:

No, this wasn’t.

But in order to

illuminate, give meaning, give context to discussion of the
more recent activities, it is necessary to give history.
If one operates on a theory that you should take longer to
write the background, that will delay the publication of
those matters that are more current, and therefore I think
the policy defeats itself because the two are really re-lated.
QUESTION:

Under Gertz what might be negligence

for a news magazine, a. weekly news magazine might not be

as to the standard of liability, that is actual —
QUESTION:-

That has to be your position.

MR. BUCKLEY:

That’s right.

I don’t think that

the definition of actual malice changes because the publishe
is a news reporter versus an historian.

The standard Is the

same, was the comment published with a high degree of

45
awareness of probable falsity, as the Court stated in —
QUESTION:

Well, If there is an element of wreck-

lessness In It, there is a difference.
MR. BUCKLEY:

I don’t really think so because the

policy underlying the actual malice standard is getting at
the calculated falsehood.
QUESTION:

I don’t see —

Mr. Buckley, am I right in understand­

ing Mr. Dickstein and Is he right in saying if I am right in
understanding him to say so, that the District Court simply
accepted at Its face value the affidavit of an interested
defendant, that he intended no malice and granted judgment
on that basis?
MR. BUCKLEY:

That is no so.

First of all,

With respect to the statement that Wolston had been Identi­
fied as a Soviet agent as a result of an official investiga­
tion, it was undisputed that Barron relied upon an official
report of the FBI which so identified him.

So there was no

evidence here of knowledge of falsity or wreckless disregard.
Now, in addition to that, Barron submitted an af­
fidavit and was deposed and in that context swore that he
believed the truth of his publication.
QUESTION:

But there is no reason why the District

Court has to believe that and a motion for summary judgment.
MR. BUCKLEY:

On the motion for summary judgment,

if the court can grant summary judgment, if there are no

contrary inferences that can fairly be drawn from the
evidence.

If —
QUESTION:

But an interested party’t testimony

can always be disbelieved by a jury.
MR. BUCKLEY:
stand alone here.

If it stood alone, but it didn't

One had the FBI report which itself in

fact identified Wolston as a Soviet agent.

I think that in

the reply brief, the petitioner candidly admits that his
position is that a plaintiff in a libel case has no obliga­
tion to introduce evidence contradicting the sworn assertions
of a publisher as to his belief in the truth of his publica­
tion.

It would have —
QUESTION:

The burden is on the party moving for

summary judgment and the credibility of interested witnesses
for the jury.

Do you dispute either of those propositions?

MR. BUCKLEY:
QUESTION:

No.

Then why should your party have gotten

summary judgment here?
MR. BUCKLEY:

Because there were no contrary in­

ferences which cou3.d be fairly drawn from the evidence in­
volved in this case.

How can reliance upon an official

report of the FBI unequivocally categorically identifying
someone as

z.

Soviet agent constitute proof in any sense of

actual malice.

Were it so, then historians and newscasters

would report, the official findings of such agencies at their

peril, because under petitioner’s view there must always be
a costly trial Irrespective of the evidence, and he is
under no obligation, in his view, to present evidence to
the contrary, putting in issue as he must a genuine issue
of material fact.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we have de­

tained you unduly long, M(r. Buckley.
MR. BUCKLEY:

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dickstein, do you

have something further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY DICKSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

We would probably have a quite different case here
if Mr. Wolston had challenged the FBI’s right to investigate
into espionage or the right of the United States government
to issue a suhpoena compelling his attendance before a grand
jury conduc ting such an investigat ion.
But one thing Is quite clear even on this abbre­
viated record and that is that the only justification, the
only excuse that Mr. Wolston ever gave for nob complying was
his physical and mental condition at the time the subpoena
was issued.
He did not take a position in this public contro­
versy with a view toward influencing it.

Indeed, if one

looks at the contemporaneous newspaper articles, they are
replete with references to "he refused to comment," "he
disappeared," "he could not be reached."

And when you read

the article concerning the event of the trial, it certainly
appears as if the reason why he terminated the trial and
plead guilty was because he wanted to resist any further
intrusion into his privacy and the privacy of his family.
We are not

—
QUESTION:

Suppose the witness was subpoenaed in

these same circumstances, instead of just refusing to appeal’
and taking all the consequences of a contempt citation and
so forth, decided to go to one of the Caribbean islands or
South American countries and then there would be a good many
newspaper accounts, assume newspaper accounts that he had
fled the country.

And then perhaps when extradition pro­

ceedings were started to get him back, he moved to some South
American country that has no extradition treaty with the
United States and you had another series of stories.

Do you

think that night at some stage bring him into the public
figure category?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Not as I understand the teaching

of this Court’s opinions in Gertz and Firestone.

We are

not suggesting that this Court should assume that Wolston’s
actions were non-volitional for purposes of determining
whether or not he was a public figure.

In fact, we are

prepared to have the Court assume that they were volitional,
that he did not obey the subpoena and that he was properly
plead.
But that is not the kind of activity that we under­
stand is spoken of in Gertz and in Firestone as to making
him a public figure.
Mr. Buckley has asserted that this is a very
evanescent proposition.

How can the press expect to know

what Wolston's state of mind was when he failed to obey the
subpoena?

,hn.t we

He never suggested that for one moment.

have said is that there is not a scintilla, there was not a
scintilla of Indication that Wolston was refusing to obey a
subpoena in order to have impact upon the processes of
controversy, the dispute, in order to persuade the public
of a position, much like the analogy that I employed in my
opening argument with respect to the Hollywood Ten.

No

guesswork was required here.
But what of the standard that Mr. Buckley does
advocate?

He suggests that perhaps when someone has been

convicted of a crime, some special things occur.
point at least he becomes a public figure.

At that

Well, if one

thinks about guesswork in terms of assessing concrete facts
then self-evident, what about the crystal-balling that
would be involved in application of such a standard?

The

press would rightfully complain how can we possibly know

50
how much breathing space we have, how much room we have
for error in commenting upon this man's conduct in the
trial and his background if we have to wait until convic­
tion and final judgment before we know whether or not and
what we can say.
Indeed, I dare suggest that given the criminal
processes which fortunately were speeded up somewhat in
this country, in most instances the statute of limitations
on libel in most jurisdictions would have run long before
the press could fathom the extent of the room which it was
being allowed by such a standard.
To be sure, Mr. Wolston has been stripped of his
privacy, but that does not mean that he is thereby to be
ftg.de a

subject

of additional sanction at the 'behest of the

Reader’s Digest.

Judge Kashin twenty years ago decided

what was an appropriate sanction.
With regard to the question of actual malice and
your questions, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if the actual malice
standard was applicable here, and we say it is not, but if
it were held to be the question would then be whether Barron
had serious doubts about the truth of the statement that
Wolston was a Soviet agent but went ahead and published it
anyway.
Now, lest we be misunderstood, we are not suggest­
ing — and I .answered before, Mr. Justice Blackmun —• that

51
there is a varying standard depending upon the length of
time that has occurred since the events which ostensibly
or purportedly make one a public figure.

We say the

standard is the same, but the manner in which that standard
is to be applied is not rigid, it must take into considera­
tion, and particularly if one is going to ascribe to the
balance the accommodation of Interests referred to in Gertz
and predecessor opinions, one must take into consideration
the circumstances of publication.

And hence whether you

are talking about actual malice or negligence or the minimal
standard of fault permissible by Gertz, we think it com­
pletely appropriate that the trier of fact, the jury in
this instance, have the opportunity to determine whether or
not whatever standard of care is to be employed was employed
under these circumstances.
When Barron testified, when Barron submitted gin
affidavit that he had no doubt whatever about any statement
in his book, I submit that such extravagant overstatement
should have been self-impeaching.

Instead, it was fully

When he said, yes, I knew about Morros’ view of

Soble’s credibility, that he was a confirmed liar, but I
didn’t rely upon that, I relied upon the FBI report and did
the two put together create any doubt in my mind —
QUESTION:

Mr. Dickstein, he Is a confirmed liar

as all agents are confirmed liars, aren’t they, all spies?

52
I don’t really understand your theory about why that should
have put him on notice that his statement after he had
acknowledged his status as a spy would necessarily be
suspect.
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Your Honor, there is so much in

that book which is just completely inconsistent,

chat is in

which Slava is described, is completely inconsistent with
Wolston, a man as he lived.

There is more than that.

We

are talking about an accusation made, a statement, a report,
if you will, filed by the FBI in I960, at a time when it
was known that accusations of this kind were rampant and
often overstated.

We have a period of time which ran since.

We also have the indisputable fact known to
QUESTION:

Barren —-

None of those things wouId put the

author on notice that maybe this statement was false.
MR. DICKSTEIN:
Your Honor.

There are other circumstances,

I am not necessarily saying on notice.

I

think the man was on notice, and the question was what was
his own self assessment as to the extent to which he enter­
tained doubts.

The mere fact as he knew it that Wolston

was in the grip of federal prosecutorial power and yet was
never indicted for espionage should have said somethin,;; to
him.

All of these things — Barron's testimony at deposi­

tion was not only extravagant and self-serving, some of it
sounded like a lawyer’s post litem inventions.

That in and

of it self should have enabled us to challenge ills credi ■
bility.

This over-broad statement with respect to every

proposition in his book being true, that should have been a
basis for assessing his credibility.

The fact that ho saw

facilities —
QUESTION:

But even if you consider he was totally

impeached, just remove all testimony from the record, you
still have some affirmative burden of showing a knowledge of
falsity.

I am trying to find out how you discharge your

affirmative burden.

Maybe you can eliminate his affidavit.

Let's strike it from the record.
MR. DICKSTEIN:

What have you got left?

Given the facts that we have, if

a jury believes that Barron was lying, we think that that
alone is —
QUESTION:

Maybe they won't put him on the witness

Maybe they won't even put him on the witness stand.
MR. DICKSTEIN:

0h; but I would, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

QUESTION:

Well, they might believe he was lying,

but that doesn't necessarily follow that anything was untrue,
does it?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

If there are facts and circumstances

which —
QUESTION:

Just because a jury can disblieve and

54
disregard his affidavit doesn?t mean they have to conclude
that he absolutely knew or suspected that something was
false.
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Standing by itself, that those

were the facts here, that might be the case, but it does
not stand by itself, because there are —
QUESTION:

Say the mental element could be satis­

fied if there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of
the informant or the accuracy of his report.

Now, as Mr.

Justice Stevens asked you, how do you satisfy that burden
of proof?

What obvious reasons were there for the defendant

to doubt the accuracy of his information objectively?
MR. DICKSTEIN:

Objectively, there was the fact

that Wolston was never indicted for espionage, there was the
fact that Soble who, while the witness denies that that was
the only basis for the FBI report, was characterised as a
liar by one who knew him best.

There were facts in the FBI

report and in the Morros book which demonstrably had no
bearing and no connection with Wolston, they could not be
one and the same person.

There was the fact that in the

Morros book, Morris clearly suggests that in his view Soble
was putting him on in order to get some money out of him, in
order to cool him, what he refers to with respect to
Soble5s always declining, always finding excuses so that
Morros could not meet Wolston —

QUESTION:

So you say at least there was a jury

question about that?

MR. DICKSTEIN:

Exactlys and this case was dis­

posed of on summary judgment.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
