MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Geller, I think you may nroceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of ce^tiorar-’ to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

The

issue is whether a defendant is entitled to collateral relief
for his conviction under 28 U.S.C. 2255 merely because the
District Judge failed to follow the formal requirements of
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in acc:pt
ing his guilty plea.
We believe that under this Court's consistent inter
prstation of the scope of habeas corpus

for non-constitution

al errors, the respondent was not entitled to section 2255
relief as a result of this violation of the rule and that
the Court of Appeals therefore erred in reversing the
District Court's order denying the writ.
The facts may be briefly summarized as follows:
The respondent was one of twenty-two defendants named in a
narcotics conspiracy indictment filed in the Eastern District

4
of Michigan in May 1972.

After extensive plea bargaining,

the respondent agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy
count of the indictment.

In return, the government agreed to

drop the remaining 17 substantive counts and also agreed not
to pursue an unrelated bail jumping charge against him.
The District Court then conducted a Rule 11 proceed­
ing at which it questioned respondent prior to determining
whether to accept his plea.

There is no dispute that the

court’s inquiry at this proceeding fully complied with Rule
11 in every respect except one.

Although the court mentioned

that the respondent pleaded guilty, he could be sentenced to
15 years in prisonment and a $25,000 fine., the court neglected
to add that the respondent would also be subject to a mandatory special parole term of at least three years.
Four months later, the respondent was sentenced to
ten years in prison, live years special parole, ana to a
$5,000 fine.

Now, the respondent did not appeal his convic­

tion, nor during the following two years did he signal his
displeasure with any other aspect of his plea in any xvay.
In August 1976, however, the respondent moved to
vacate his sentence under section 2255, alleging for the
first time that the District Court had violated Rule 11 by
failing to mention the special parole term at the time of
his plea.
The motion is set out at page 11 of the joint

5
appendix.

It alleges only that Rule 11 was violated.

It

doesn't expressly state that the respondent was actually un­
aware of the special parole provisions when he pleaded guilty,
and more Important, it doesn’t claim that the respondent
wouldn’t have entered the exact same guilty plea if the judge
had. notified him on the record of the special parole require­
ment .

v
In fact, the motion doesn’t allege that the respond­

ent was prejudiced in any way by a violation of the rule.

And

the same can be said for the respondent's allegations in his
memorandum in support of his motion, which is set out begin­
ning at page 14 of the appendix, and the oral argument at the
hearing on that motion, which begins at page 18 of the joint
appendix, no allegation of actual prejudice.
Now, the District Court denied respondent's 2255
motion.

The court acknowledged that it hadn’t complied fu!Py

with Rule 11 in taking respondent’s plea, but it concluded
that the respondent hadn’t been harmed in any way by the
technical error and that he therefore wasn’t entitled to
section 2255 relief.

The court noted that there was strong

indications in the record that the respondent had been in­
formed by his attorney of the consequences of his plea prior
to pleading guilty, but that even if he hadn't, in light of
all the other factors involved in the plea bargain, knowledge
of the special parole provisions wouldn’t have influenced the

6
respondent's decision to plead guilty.
The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded with in­
structions to vacate respondent’s conviction and to allow him
to plead anew.

The Court of Appeals didn’t dispute any of

the District Court’s fact findings, but it held, relying
primarily on this Court’s decision in McCarthy v. United
States, that since Rule 11 had been violated, the respondent
was automatically entitled to withdraw his plea without
regard to whether he was actually prejudiced by the defect
or whether he had raised the Rule 11 violation on direct
appeal or on collateral attack.
Now, I think it would be helpful for me to begin my
discussion by explaining the limits of the government’s sub­
mission in this case.

We certainly don't contend that a

defendant who pleads guilty is therever foreclosed from
ever attacking his guilty plea.

The defendant has a number

of adequate remedies.
He can move to withdraw his plea before sentencing,
and under Rule 32(d) withdrawal for virtually any reason is
to be freely allowed at that stage.

And after sentence has

been imposed, the defendant may appeal his conviction and may,
of course, raise any objections he may have to the plea
taking procedure or to the plea itself.

And even after the

time for appeal has run and the conviction has become final,
a defendant unquestionably may always attack his conviction

7
collaterally under section 2255 if the plea was involuntary
or otherwise constitutionally defective.
Our contention here is simply that a defendant who
foregoes all of these remedies is not entitled to collateral
relief from his conviction.

Often as in this case, years

after his guilty plea, when all that he can show is that some
portion of Rule 11 was not complied with when his plea was
accepted.

We believe that on collateral attack there must

also be some showing of substantial prejudice to the defend­
ant either in the sense that the Rule 11 error materially
affected the defendant’s decision to plead guilty or because
for any other reason it would be manifestly unjust to hold
him to his plea.
This standard of collateral reviet? of noneonstitutional errors is one that this Court has frequently
applied.

And perhaps the case closest in point is Hill v.

United States, 368 U.S.

That case, like this one, involved

a motion to vacate sentence under section 2255 by a defendant
who claimed that his conviction had been entered in violation
of the rule of criminal procedure.

The rule involved there

was Rule 32(a) which gives a defendant an absolute right to
make a statement prior to sentencing.
Although the court acknowledge in Hill that the
right guaranteed a defendant by Rule 32(a) was an important
one and that the defect would have required vacation 'of the

8
defendant's sentence if it had been raised on direct appeal,
the court denied collateral relief saying that the error was
not a fundamental defect that "inherently results in a
complete miscarriage of justice."
QUESTION:
Hill about prejudice?

Mr. Geller, was there anything said in
I read Hill to simply mean this is

not the kind of thing for which you can have collateral
relief3 period.
MR. GELLER:

Well, the court could have decided

Hill I think on the ground that not having appealed Hill was
foreclosed from getting collateral relief.

But it went on,

it didn’t go off on that ground, it went on to discuss what
requirements are for getting collateral relief for nonconstitutional plea3 and it set forth the standard that we
rely on here which Is that there must be a fundamental defect
that inherently results in a substantial miscarriage of
justice.
QUESTION:

But is it because the nature of the

fundamental defect is such that the defect will inevitably
in every case result in a denial of justice, or is it a
question of prejudice case by case?
MR. GELLER:

I think it must be a case by case de­

termination.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Is that the way you read Hill?
Well, Hill says that for Rule 32 error,

9
the only remedy Is direct appeal.
QUESTION:

You just can't have collateral review

for a Rule 32 violation, no matter how badly you are preju­
diced by it.
MR. GELLER:

Well, except I suppose in the situa­

tion of a change in law such as in the Davis situation —
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

In Davis.
-- that made that limited exception,

but otherwise I would agree with Your Honor.

The court' added

in Hill that collateral relief, as I said, is not available
in that type of situation, and these same statements that
the court made in Hill were repeated even more recently in
the Davis cast?, 417 U.S., and again in Stone v. Powell.
In light of these decisions, we think it is rather
clear that the respondent's claim, which as the District
Court noted, amounts to nothing more than the assertion that
Rule 11 was violated when he pleaded guilty is not cognisable
under section 2255.
QUESTION:

Well, when you include Stone v. Powell

along with Hill and Davis, in Stone v. Powell there was a
clear claim of a constitutional violation that would, except
for some other rule, be cognisable under 2255s wouldn't it?
MR. GELLER:

That's right, there were other reasons

aside from the scope of the habeas

corpus which led the

Court in Stone v. Powell not to grant the writ for reasons

10
that related to the exclusionary rule.
QUESTION:

I take it that if the claim was inade­

quate assistance of counsel, you would have a different view?
MR. GELLER:

Yes, that would be a constitutional

error, assuming there -was no procedural fault which would
prevent its being raised on collateral attack we concede
would be — section 2255 relief would be available.
QUESTION:

Is there a procedural fault?

Certainly

pleading guilty doesn’t waive an inadequate counsel claim,
would it?
MR. GELLER:

I would assume not, not an inadequacy

of counsel claim.
QUESTION:

What procedural fault would bar an in­

adequate —MR. GELLER:

I assume if new counsel handled an

appeal and decided not, for whatever reasons, decided not to
raise inadequacy of counsel at the trial on the direct
appeal, that might preclude habeas corpus relief later on,
but that —
QUESTION:

Not until they — not if they took it
v

back to the state courts and exhausted it.
MR. GELLER:

Well, when you are dealing with 225^

relief, there may be questions of comity, but I think in
section 2255 that absence of —
QUESTION:

Well, if you have exhausted it in the

11
state courts., you have exhausted it.
MR. GELLER:

That’s right, but if there is cause for

not raising the issue on direct appeal, then it may be allow­
able to raise the claim on section 225^ or 2255, but that of
course is a rule in cases of constitutional errors.

The

court has always drawn a distinction between constitutional
and non-constitutional errors as far as the availability of
collateral attack.
QUESTION:

What about the failure to inform, assume

the failure to inform the client before a Rule 11 hearing
that the minimum mandatory was three years before parole can
be considered, would the failure to inform the client of
that be Ineffective assistance of counsel?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Well, I hesitate to answer that —
On a whole record of this kind, could

you —
MR. GELLER:

I would think not.

I would think not,

that is our argument here essentially, that what is important
is whether the defendant would have pleaded guilty nonethe­
less, if he would have even if he had been given this actvlee
which he says he was not given, then we don’t see how he has
been prejudiced, and in the absence of prejudice he is not
entitled to collateral relief.
QUESTION:

Well, the representation at least as the

District Judge construed it was that the defense counsel had

12
represented that he had Informed his client of all of these
elements.

Was that not so?
MR. GELLER:

That is correct.

The District Court

had ■—
QUESTION:

Is there in effect a fact finding that

that was so?
MR. GELLER:

That is one of the grounds we relied

on,
QUESTION:

Well, he didn’t testify that he had in­

formed him specifically of this —
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
He just said generally his practice is

to —
MR. GELLER:

Well, there are two thinp;s that the

District Court relied on.
QUESTION:

But he had no specific recollection of

advising this person of this particular issue.
MR. GELLER:

That’s correct, although the District

Court relied on two separate statements by defense counsel.
One was a statement at the Rule II proceeding Itsseif that
he had advised his — that he was of the view that his client
was aware of the consequences of his plea, and then the
second statement was the one you just referred to, Mr. Justice
White, which is at the section 2255 hearing a few years later
when counsel said that it was his practice before allowing a

13
client to plead guilty, to advise that client of the conse­
quences of the plea although he couldn’t say whether in this
particular case, two years or so having passed, he had actually
done so.

But there were two separate statements by counsel
/

that the District Court relied on in inferring that the
respondent actually knew of the special parole term, but that
wasn’t the only string to the District Court’s bow and it is
not ours.

We also allege that the respondent would not have

changed his plea from guilty to not guilty if he had been
informed of the special parole term.

The District Court

made that finding also and we think that that finding, which
respondent has never challenged, is amnly supported by the
record in this case.
QUESTION:

Are there not a line of civil cases

with respect to wills and to some extent some of them
notarial acknowledgements that years after the events, where
the notary or the witness to a will cannot have any — says
he does not have any personal recollection of the event, that
his practice was never to sign a will unless he saw the
testator sign it or never to take an acknowledgement unless
the person personally appeared before him.

That line of

cases is that the testimony as to general practice is suf­
ficient to carry the day.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Well, I agree that —
How do you apply that?

Do you think

that is equally applicable to a criminal —
MR. GELLER:

I think it is of probative value that

defense counsel stated at the section 2255 hearing; that it
was his practice not to allow clients to plead guilty before
making certain that that client is aware of the consequences
of the plea.

I think it was certainly open to the District

Court to take that into account in making the fact finding
which we have relied on here.
Now, as I mentioned —QUESTION:

Mr. Seller, before you p;o on, If I

understand the government's position correctly, the District
Court should not even leave had a hearing because the allega­
tions really weren't sufficient to raise it.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
here.

That's correct.
Of course, they did have the hearing

You attach weight to whether he would have pleaded

guilty or not.

There were a group of cases about ten years

ago on the question of when there is no eligibility for
parole.

1 am sure you have read some of those cases, the

failure to advise the defendant of ineligibility.

Under

your view, would that be grounds for collateral attack?
MR. GELLER:

I think you would have to engage in

the same sort of inquiry we suggest here, which is that if
the defendant had not been told of his ineligibility for
parole —

15
QUESTION:

Assume that, a violation of Rule 11,

right.
MR. GELLER:

no, I don’t say there would not be

a per se rule, you would have to make a determination whether
— oh, excuse me, I am to assume that he wouldn’t have pleaded
guilty if he had —
QUESTION:

No, I just say assume that he was not

advised and that there was therefore a violation of Rule 11.
MR. GELLER:

Yes, you would still have to engage in

ohe case by case analysis thac we suggest here on collator
attack to determine whether that defendant if he had been told
that he was ineligible for parole would have changed his plea
from guilty to not guilty.

I think that arose in the Seventh

Circuit cases.
QUESTION:

Would you say that anything counsol tell:

him that the judge needn't tell him even though Rule 11 re­
quires it?
MR. GELLER:
been violated.
vO

i. > ‘vt -L JL

Not when the question is has Rule 11

Certainly, Rule 11 requires the District Court

-he defendant certain things, but —
QUESTION:

Yes, I agree, that would be a violation,;

but how about —
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

That would be a violation of Rule 11,
But what about collateral attack?
On collateral attack, certainly.

It Is

16
exceedingly important what the defendant knew and not who told
him in determining whether or not there has been prejudice in
holding him. to his guilty plea.

Certainly it would be ex­

ceedingly relevant if, although the District Court violated
Rule 11 in not telling the defendant certain things, his
attorney told him that information.
But as I mentioned here, the respondent has never
alleged that he wouldn’t have pleaded guilty if he had known
about the special parole term, and the District Court
expressly found that the Rule 11 error had no effect on his
decision to enter his plea, and this fact finding is certainly
supported by the evidence.

The respondent obtained the dis­

missal of 17 serious narcotics counts and a bail jumping
charge by pleading guilty to the one count in this case, and
he unquestionably knew that his guilty plea couict result in
a sentence of up to 15 years in orison and a $25,000 fine.
Now, I might also add in this regard that at the
time the respondent pleaded guilty, severs'1 of his co­
defendants were undergoing a trial In the Eastern District of
Michigan at which the government was presenting devastating
evidence against them, evidence that would have been I think
equally probative of the respondent’s guilt, and that also I
am sure entered into the respondent’s decision to ™
QUESTION:
MR. CELLER:

Is that in the record?
Yes, it is, during the section 2255

17
hearing.
QUESTION:
MR. (SELLER:

The devastating evidence?
Yes — well, actually the court does

make certain statements during the Rule 11 proceeding about
how the trial was going on at the moment either in that pro™
ceedlng or in the section 2255 hearing, he does make certain
statements about the overwhelming weight of the evidence tlat
liras being introduced at that trial.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

How did he know about it?
Excuse me?
The judge knew about what was going on

in somebody else’s trial?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

The judge was trying that case.
Oh.
So like the District Court, in light

of all these factors, we think it is exceedingly improbable
that respondent would have changed his mind about the plea
bargain if he had been informed that he could

be sentenced

to a term of special parole which would not have any appre­
ciable effect* upon him unless he were years later to violate
the conditions of the parole.
Moreover, there is no manifesting justice in hold­
ing respondent to this guilty plea.

As I just mentioned,

the respondent knew when he pleaded guilty that he could be
sentenced up to 15 years imprisonment and his eventual

18
sentence of 10 years imprisonment plus 5 years special parole
is therefore no greater for all practical purposes, it is
substantially less than he was told he could receive.

Even

if the respondent violates the conditions of his special
parole and the parole commission determines to send him bach
to prison for that 5-year period, he can't serve more than
the 15 year’s imprisonment that he knew was his exposure when
he pleaded guilty.
Now, perhaps the most important reason in our view
why the respondent isn’t entitled to section 2255 relief as a
result of this non-constitutional violation is that this is
hardly a situation where, as the Court said in Hill, the
need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus
is apparent.

There is no reason why this Rule 11 defect

couldn't have been raised on direct appeal.

All the relevant

facts relating to the violation are apparent on the f&e© of
the record and the respondent, who had the advice of counsel„
should have been aware at the time of sentencing that the
trial judge had neglected to mention the special parole 1

• i

when the plea was taken.
This is especially true, I would, think, when if a
defendant’s ignorance of the special parole term truly played
a meaningful role in his decision to enter the guilty plea.
There is no reason why a defendant such as respondent should
be allowed to forego direct appeal and to wait several years

19
to raise a claim such as this.
QUESTION:

This was a guilty plea?

MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It used to be considered a little odd for

somebody who had pleaded guilty and had been found -— and had
been convicted on the basis of his plea of guilty immediately
to take an appeal.

1 guess there is no problem about that

any more, is there?
MR. GELLER:

McCarthy was a case just like that,

direct appeal after a guilty plea.

There is no bar to doing

it if the violation relates to the plea taking procedures
itself rather than some —■
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Is there any bar anyway.?
Excuse me?
There is no bar anyway, I guess, any

more, is there?
MR. GELLER:

Well, a guilty plea waives any ante­

cedent constitutional violations.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Nevertheless you can take an appeal.
You can take an appeal, although you

won’t be very successful, I would assume.
QUESTION:

Does the record show when the defendant

here first became aware of the special parole term?
MR. GELLER:

No, it doesn't.

20
QUESTION:

So we don't know whether he knew it

before the time to appeal or not ?
MR. GELLER:

Well, the fact is he was sentenced to

a special parole term.
QUESTION:

So I understand, but if it is in writing

-- you know, these documents are rather complicated to read,
and —
MR. GELLER:

He had the advice of counsel.

the assistance of counsel at this time.

He had

If in fact he

pleaded guilty because he didn’t know anything about a
special parole term and he never thought he would be exposed
to one, it seems to me that he should have been curious about
what it was when he was sentenced, when he was sentenced to
it.
QUESTION:

But he didn’t start to serve it right

away.
MR. GELLER:

No, but he should have been aware of

it at that point and if he thought he got sentence to some­
thing greater than he had bargained for, one would assume he
would have raised it.
QUESTION:

But you just said the record doesn’t

show whether he became aware of it until after his appeal
time had run.
MR. GELLER:
at that point —

That’s true, but if he was aware of It

21
QUESTION:

If he was, but we don’t know whether he

was or not.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
I suppose if one were sentenced to ten

consecutive terms in open court, he wouldn’t start actually
serving the tenth consecutive term, say, of five years, for
forty-five years.
MR. GELLER:

That's right, but presumably he should

be aware at that moment if he has been given a greater sentence
than he thought he was exposing himself to by pleading guilty.
Now the Court of Appeals didn’t necessarily disagree
with many of the arguments that I have just made about the
scope of collateral attack.

In fact, the Sixth Circuit

candidly remarked that the Rule 11 violation in this case did
not seem to rise to the level of a "fundamental defect which
inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice."
Nonetheless, the court felt that the respondent was
entitled to relief because of the presumptive prejudice rule
of McCarthy.

The court read McCarthy as holding that a Rule

11 violation Is per se prejudicial to the defendant and thus
satisfies the Hill and Davis test.
Now. we have explained in our brief why we think
that the automatic reversal rule of McCarthy which was announced in the exercise of this Court’s supervisory powers
rather than as a rule of constitutional law, may have outlived

22
its usefulness, especially since there is now a new version
of Rule 11, in effect.

But whether or not some of the

premises of McCarthy should, now be reexamined — and I don’t
think the Court has to reach that issue in this case —
believe that the automatic reversal rule has no place in a
motion to vacate sentence under section 2255, where the sole
relevant inquiry is whether the particular defendant's
detention is unlawful.
McCarthy, of course, was a direct appeal and there
is nothing in the Court’s opinion to suggest that every
violation of Rule 11 constitutes the sort of substantial
prejudice sort of miscarriage of justice that would entitle
a defendant to habeas corpus relief.
QUESTION:

In fact ~~

Mr. Geller, couldn’t we maintain your

position by merely saying that two findings of the District
Court were enough and not get into the general rule of howfar 2255 goes?
MR. GELLER:

I think you can, but I think what you

have to confront is what the Sixth Circuit held in this case
which is that the automatic reversal rule

this Court

promulgated in McCarthy has no application on collateral
attack.

I think you would, have to say, which is what we

suggest the correct rule is, that on collateral attack there
is no such thing as presumptive prejudice, the defendant has
to show that he has actually been prejudiced.

Now, I think

23
if the Court adopts that —
QUESTION:

It is all right, but as I understand

this party himself in District Court said in so many words
that he hadn't been prejudiced.
MR. SELLER:

He has never alleged that he has been,

that is correct.
QUESTION:
MR. SELLER:

Well, isn’t that enough?
Well, except, as I say, if he doesn’t

have to prove prejudice to be entitled to rel-'e^ because of
a Rule 11 violation, which is what the Sixth Circuit said,
We think that the Court should reject the notion that on
collateral attack that the presumptive prejudice rule should,
apply and that it should be up to the defendant on a 2255
motion to show actual prejudice which, as I agree with Your
Honor, you can’t do in this case.
Now, this Court is well aware of the strong
societal interest in the finality of judgments in criminal
cases.

And while society may be willing to incur the sub­

stantial costs associated with collateral attacks in order
to correct errors of constitutional magnitude or cases
where a prisoner has been greviously harmed, the writ is the
only effective means of preserving his rights, we believe
that a contrary result is clearly dictated in cases involving
non-constitutional violations, especially where those viola­
tions could have been raised on direct appeal.

24
Since the Rule 11 error in this case didn’t influ­
ence the respondent's decision to plead guilty or otherwise
lead to a complete miscarriage of justice, we believe that
the respondent should have raised a technical violation on
direct appeal or not at all, and the interst of justice is
certainly not served by allowing the defendant such as the
respondent unlimited time and a free option to undo their
convictions by establishing a non-prejudicial omission in
their Rule 11 inquiry.
The Court of Appeals in our view therefore erred in
holding that the respondent was automatically entitled to
vacate his conviction under section 2255, and we submit that
accordingly this Court should reverse the judgment below.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Geller.

Mr. Mogill.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M, MOGILL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MOGILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At issue in this case is the continuing availability
of section 2255 relief to persons who have no other remedy
available to them and where in custody in consequence of pleas
taken without advice of the full penal consequences of their
please.

Also at issue is the standard of review to be applied

25
in cases raising such claims.
I think it is important initially to make clear
that the statement of facts offered by the government is in­
adequate and it does not fully represent the facts of the
case.
QUESTION:

Well., are we free to rely on the colloquy

that is in the record that —
MR... MOGILL:

Certainly, and I would like briefly

however to point out to the Court where the facts offered by
the government are insufficient.
QUESTION:

But you don’t contend that this transcript

is inaccurate in any respect?
MR. MOGILL:
on the transcript.

Certainly not.

In fact, I am relying

I am pointing out--to the Court that at

the time Mr. Timmreck offered his plea he specifically
affirmatively stated to the District Judge that he was not
aware of the consequences of his plea.

The District Judge

advised Mr. Timmreck that he was subject to a potential 15
years maximum incarceration; the District Judge did not
advise Mr. Timmreck that a mandatory special parole term of
three years must be applied if a sentence were imposed and
that —
QUESTION:

Would you suggest that the District

Judge's finding that he was informed was not permissible under
your representation that that was your practice, to inform

26
clients but that you didn't have any independent recollection
at the time?
MR. MOGILL:

I don't think the District Judge made

a finding that Mr. Timmreck wasn't informed.
QUESTION:

Well* he in effect made such a finding.

MR. MOGILL:

I think he concluded that -- well, I

think the Important —
QUESTION:

He concluded that you had adequately

Informed your client.
MR. MOGILL:

The important points here are, one,

regardless of whether I informed Mr. Timmreck of the manda­
tory special parole term.

It is clear that at the time he

offered his plea, he was not aware of it, he so Indicated to
the judge.

And the second point that is important and is

part of the reasoning underlying the particular requirements
of Rule 11, Is that Rule 11 is desip;ned to insure that the
adequacy of the record of a voluntary plea appears from the
four corners of the record of the plea and it does not require
any fact finding outside of that record.
QUESTION:

When, as you say, he responded that he

did not understand fully and the judge told him he was
subject to a 15-year imprisonment, what was your obligation
to the court at that time and to your client?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I —
What was your obligation to the court

27
and to your client?
MR. MOGILL:

My obligation was the same as that of

the Assistant United States Attorney and both of us candidly
apparently missed the fact that the District Judge failed to
advise him.

Had I caught it, it would have been my obligation

to advise the court that it had failed to mention it, that a
mandatory special parole term of at least three years and
possibly up to life was to be imposed in the event of a
custodial sentence.

It would have also been the Assistant

United States Attorney’s obligation.

1 think it was important

for the Court to note that both parties, counsel for both
parties inadvertently, for the same reason the District
Judge inadvertently neglected to advise the respondent of the
mandatory special parole term, but that in fact did occur
and that the respondent had indicated that he was not aware
of the consequences.
QUESTION:

Didn't you have several days to talk

with your client?
MR. MOGILL:

There were no problems in terms of

communication with my client.
QUESTION:

What I mean — you mean you forgot it

for a whole lot of days?

How long were you talking with him

before he pleaded guilty?
MR. MOGILL:

There is nothing in the record of this

ease indicating the time period Involved of communication

28
between counsel and
QUESTION:

Well, it was before he walked in the

court room?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

Certainly.
And before he walked in the court room

the attorney advised him as to the law involved, didn’t he?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

I have no present recollection -Didn’t you?
The record indicates that —
Well, don’t you usually find out what

the law is?
MR. MOGILL:

—- and it reflects that I indicated to

the District Judge at that —
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:
or not.

And this time you didn’t?
I have no recollection whether I did

The point is ~
QUESTION:

And if you did have a recollection, your

client would be out of court?
MR. MOGILL:

Not if my client did know regardless

of whether he was advised by counsel.
QUESTION:

I said if you happened to recollect that

you did tell him, your client would be out of court.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

Not necessarily.
Well, what ~
Justice Marshall, I think the important

29
point here is that regardless of whether he is advised by
counsel5 the important inquiry is whether he was advised on
the record at the time of the plea and whether he knew on
the record at the time of the plea.

The fact is he didn't

knovj on the record at the time of the plea, he indicated as
much to the District Judge.

The government has never alleged,

and I don’t take it to be alleging now that anyone’s memory
conveniently lapsed or anything like that and as an officer
of the court I suggest that —
QUESTION:

Mr. Mogill, your statement or your con­

clusion that he did not know about the mandatory special
parole term is based on his statement that when he was told
it could be as much as 15 years in jail» he said I know it
now?
MR. MOGILL:

And immediately prior to that, whc.::

the judge asked him are you aware of the consequences of your
plea, he affirmatively said no.
QUESTION:

Well, you think that necessarily fore­

closes the possibility that he did know about the mandatory
special parole term?
MR. MOGILL:

I think it Indicates to anyone reading

that record that he was not aware of the consequences of his
plea.
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

Of all the consequences.
And a mandatory special parole term is

30

a direct consequence, in fact the government concedes it to
be a direct consequence.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the no doesn’t mean he didn't

know about any of the consequences of the plea.
MR. MOGILL:

I think it speaks for itself in what­

ever interpretations -QUESTION:

All right.

Anyway, that is what you are

relying on?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

Yes.
For the District Court to say are you

aware of the consequences of your guilty plea, and the
defendant saying no, and neither the judge nor any of the two
lawyers present say anything, is that what the —
MR. MOGILL:

Again, the record speaks for itself

in that regard,
QUESTION:
MR, MOGILL:
Court will be doing

But is that all we have to go on?
I believe that hopefully what the
in part in this case is addressing it­

self to the standard of review to be followed.
QUESTION:

Well, what I am concerned with is not

what this Court is doing but what the District Court was
doing,’what you were doing and what the Assistant U.S.
Attorney was doing.
MR. MOGILL:

I think all the parties were interested

in seeing that the Rule II proceedings were adequate.

The

31
District Judge I assume inadvertently neglected to advise Mr.
Tiramreck that a mandatory special parole term of at least
three years and as much as life was involved.

Counsel for

the government neglected to catch the error and defence
counsel neglected to catch the error.
QUESTION:

I can see that.

But I gather from what

you say s that somewhere in the record there is a Q and an .A
and the Q is from the District Judges is nAre you aware of
the consequences of your plea?" and the A is "No, 1 am not."
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
And nothing further was said by either

the judge or the —
MR. MOGILL:

No.

The next thing that happened was

the judge informed Mr. Timmreck that he xvas subject to up to
15 years.

The judge did not say that if a custodial sentence

was imposed for the violation to which he was pleading guilty,
there must also be a mandatory special parole term of at
least three years and possibly up to life.
QUESTION:

So the judge didn’t just leave it hanging

after the client responded no?
MR. MOGILL:

No, but he did not fully inform Mr.

Timmreck and in fact he misled him by failing to advise him
of the mandatory special parole term.
QUESTION:

Mr. Mogill, if the trial judge has asked

the defendant, "Are you aware of the consequences of your

32

guilty plea?" and the defendant had said, "Yes, I am," that
wouldn’t have been any indication or any proof that he was in
fact, was it?
MR. MOGILL:

That is correct, and again it goes to

the underlying purpose of the rule to make a record at the
time of the plea.
QUESTION:

And the rule imposes a duty upon the

trial judge to advise him, whatever the response is, doesn't
it?
MR. MOGILL:

And regardless of vrhether counsel has

advised him or not.
QUESTION:

Because even if the defendant says yes,

I am, he might be quite misinformed of the consequences.
MR. MOGILL:

That is correct.

Even if he was

accurately informed, the District Judge has the same obliga­
tion.
QUESTION:

Have you ever raised at any stage or has

it been suggested at any stage that there was ineffective
assistance of counsel on your part?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

It has not been.
Did you recommend to your client that

that was one issue that could be raised, a constitutional
issue?
MR. MOGILL:
up.

I do not believe that that issue came

I might point out to the Court, however, that at the time

33
the 2255 petition was initially filed in this cases the
government conceded the applicability of a Sixth Circuit case,
Wolak, and virtually conceded the merit of the 2255 petition.
The argument: the government is raising today was filed in a
supplemental — was first raised in a supplemental memorandum
filed the day of the —
QUESTION:

Mr. Mogill, they conceded the applic­

ability of that rule in the Sixth Circuit, it was not the rule
of other circuits in the United States.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

No, this case —
And it was not the rule in the Seventh

Circuit.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

No.
But Rule 11 doesn’t put any require­

ment on the defense counsel at ahl.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Well, where does that obligation arise?

MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, sir, which obligation?
The obligation of counsel to vive the

client full advice?
MR. MOGILL:

I think it Is part of counsel's gen­

eral obligation to render effective assistance.
QUESTION:

Is it a constitutional issue, effective

assistance of counsel?
MR. MOGILL:

Certainly.

3't

QUESTION:

So it arises out of the relationship of

client with counsel and linked with the constitutional Sixth
Amendment right, does it not?
MR. MOGILL:

Yes,

The purpose of Rule 11, one of

the purposes of Rule 11 though is to avoid these kinds of
inquiries, is to insure that the record at the time of the
plea reflects that the defendant was fully advised and made
a fully knowing waiver so the kind of collateral inquiries
that became involved in this case are unnecessary.
QUESTION:

On page 9 of the abstract you were

asked by the court at the plea hearing, are-you of the opinion
there is a factual basis for the plea, and you said yes, and
then and that your client knows full well the consequences
of a guilty plea might be, that’s correct.

So you were of

the opinion then that he was fully advised?
MR. MOGILL:

Clearly.

I had missed the fact that

the judge had missed advising Mr. Timmreck of the mandatory
special parole term.
QUESTION:

Not necessarily because you could have

advised him and your statement would still have been a
hundred percent accurate.
MR. MOGILL:

Right, but even if It was, it was

clear that Mr. Timmreck had forgotte'n that or didn’t know It
or hadn't paid, any attention at the time of his plea.
QUESTION:

That is a matter of interpreting, what

we have talked about before.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

Yes.
Yes.
The sentence that was imposed in this

case subjected Mr. Timmreck to a potential combined custodial
and parole,incarceration and parole custody for in excess of
15 years.

In fact, the combined sentence here subjected him

to a possible combined custody of 20 years less one day and
that is so because of the unique nature of the mandatory
special parole term.

Mr. Timmreck was sentenced to ten years

in custody under his initial sentence and five years manda­
tory special parole.

Because of the unique provisions of the

mandatory special parole term, he could serve four years and
eleven months and 29 days and if he violated on the last day
he still would be sentenced to five years, the full five
years in custody.
QUESTION:

Nov;, you represented at page 9, when

the court said to you, "Mr. Mogill, are vou of the opinion
there is a factual basis for this plea," and you answered,
"Yes, I am." "And that your client knows full well the conse✓

quences of his guilty plea might be?"

"That's correct."

You

were surely representing to the court there affirmatively,
not by inference but affirmatively that you had fully, full
vie 11 informed your client of the consequences of the plea.
MR. MOGILL:

The record speaks for itself in that

36
regard.
QUESTION:

Yes, but on the next page, the next

couple of pages, you took that back.

You said that if you

failed that you didn't really mean to represent that you
remembered that you had —
MR. MOGILL:

The statement to which you are refer­

ring; to, Mr. Justice White, was from the hearing on the 2255
and, yes, I would agree —
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

That is two years later.
That is correct.
But at the time of the Rule 11 hearing,

which is the fulcrum here, It is perfectly clear that you
represented to the court that your client had been fully In­
formed.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
And it does not do for me Individually

as a member of the Court to have you say the record speaks
for itself.
MR. MOGILL:

The only noint I wish to make, Mr.

Chief Justice, is that I have no specific recollection at
this point in time what my conversations were with my client.
QUESTION:

In any event, the government as I under­

stand it concedes that there was a Rule 11 violation.
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

Yes, it does.

But this colloquy that I am referring to

37
conceivably might have at least raised a question in your
mind whether you could appropriately continue to represent
this man without letting some other counsel come in and raise
the question of ineffective assistance of counsel

which might

or might not be a stronger case, being a constitutional
violation.
MR. MOOILL:

That was certainly Mr. Timmreck's

choice and he chose to retain me on the 2255 petition.

At

the time Mr. Timmreck was sentenced in this case,he was not
advised that he had a right to direct anneal, and it is alec
important to note that in terms of this Court being fully
advised of the facts, the government below not only initially
conceded that the Sixth Circuit case, Wolak, controlled in
the Eastern District of Michigan at that time, but also the
government didn't allege that Mr. Timmreck would have con­
tinued with his plea had he been advised of the mandatory
special parole term, the government didn’t allege that he
deliberately bypassed his right to appeal, the government
didn't allege that there was intentional delay and the
government didn't allege that its ability to reprosecute was
in any way impaired by the passage of time involved.
QUESTION:

Well, as of the time your client was

sentenced, was there an obligation on the District Court in
taking a guilty plea to advise the defendant that he had a
rIght to appeal?

MR. MOGILL:

No.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure

32(a)(2) to this day does not require a District Judge to
advise a guilty pleading defendant of a right to anneal.
QUESTION:

I would hope not.

MR. MOGILL:

At the same time, however, for the

government to argue that direct appeal is an adequate remedy
is somewhat undercut by the fact that there was no likelihood
that a guilty nleaing person is in fact going to know that
remedy in time to make use of it, and it is for that reason
that it is significant to remind the Court that 32(a)(2)
QUESTION:

Unless his attorney advises him.

MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
And isn't it reasonable to infer that

If there had been a dramatic difference between the actual
sentence and the anticipated sentence, that that proposition
would have been considered?
MR. MOGILL:

Not necessarily.

I don’t like being

in the position of suggesting that certain Inferences should
or should not be drawn.

However, If the purpose of Rule 11

is. what it plainly is. to avoid colloquy outside of the
record, I think that those kinds of inferences have to be
avoided because they require speculation as to facts outside
the record.

There is nothing on the record to Indicate

whether or not Mr. Timmreck was advised of his right to
appeal, whether or not he was advised of collateral relief,

39
whether or not he was surprised at the length of the sentence.
The fact is I think that if we are going to engage
in inferences, I think that it is a very real inference that
a person who had no criminal record before and who has just
been sentence to a very lengthy nrison term is going to be
very much taken aback by that and may not be in a position
to think clearly about whether or not to request advice from
counsel as to remedies until the initial shock wears off,
and by that time the time for appeal may well have passed.
QUESTION:

Have there oeen cases holding that the

failure to advise about this particular special parole pro­
vision is a violation of Rule 11?
MR. MOGILL:

I think it is conceded by the govern­

ment —
QUESTION:

That isn't what I asked you.

MR. MOGILL:

The Sixth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit,

the —
QUESTION:

The government can't concede what the

rule means.
MR. MOGILL:

I'm sorry, Justice White.

The Ninth

Circuit, the Sixth Circuit obviously, the First Circuit and
the Third Circuit and I believe the cirtuis not only hold
that but also find collateral relief available.
QUESTION:

The Sixth Circuit agrees with you on

this point, doesn't it?

40
MR. MOGILL:

That’s right.

The finish to the answer

was that the circuits which do not find collateral relief
available also I believe unanimous agree that this is. a direct
consequence of the plea, too, and that the failure to advise
would be a violation.
QUESTION:

Of Rule 11?

MR. MOGILL:

Of Rule 11.

They disagree as to

whether or not collateral review would be available.
QUESTION:

Counsel, when the judge announced the

sentence, exactly what did he say?
MR. MOGILL:

He pronounced sentence of ten years

Incarceration, five years mandatory special parole and a
$5,000 committed fine.
QUESTION:

So at that point your client knew about

the mandatory parole?
MR. MOGILL:

At that time those words had oeen

uttered, yes.
QUESTION:

Whether or not he knew it was

mandatory

is another question.
MR. MOGILL:

Whether or not he knew the significance

of it —
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

The judge used the word ’’mandatory”?
That’s correct.
Yes.
I think the key word to someone who is

4l
being sentenced is "parole."

And the fact that this is a

different kind of parole that applies only in drug cases and
only since 1970 and does not apply in other circumstances in
the federal system might easily escape the person who is being
sentenced in terms of the significance and in terms of the
differences between the mandatory snecial parole and tradi­
tional parole.
Section 2255 exists to insure the capacity of our
legal system to provide substantive justice and to insure a
forum for relief in all cases of illegal restraint.

It is a

flexible remedy and as this Court indicated in 1cnguage in
its opinion in Davis, there is nothing in the holdings, in
the prior holdings of this Court to indicate that the avail­
ability of 2255 is in any way reduced where the allegation
of illegal custody is one grounded in laws as opposed to the
Constitution of the United States.
I think that is by way of background, that under­
cuts the government’s argument with respect to the non­
constitutional nature of the argument here.
Additionally, I think that it is important for the
Court to consider the role of Rri.1 e l.i -i.p protecting the
adversary system, that In contrast to a trial situation and
a collateral atta„ek after a trial such as occurred in Davis,
where there is adversary litigation as to numerous questions
of law and where there is a full fact finding process, the

42
likelihood of any one error being prejudicial, of being
fundamentally prejudicial is reduced.

In a guilty plea

proceeding, however, where charges are not disputed and where
a person is convicting himself or herself out of his or her
own mouth, an error that fails to advise the defendant of an
important consequence of the guilty plea assumes much more
fundamental dimensions.
When the additional fact that approximately 85 per­
cent of the convictions in the federal system are a result
of guilty pleas is taken into account, I think that the sig­
nificance to the importance to maintaining the principles
underlying the adversary system is enhanced.

And it is

taking those matters into account that I think the govern­
ment’s argument with regard to restricting the scone of
collateral review has to be unpersuasive.
I think that the government's argument with regard
to direct appeal being sufficient remedy is further undercut
by the fact that Rule 32(a)(2) does not require an accused
to be advised of the right to appeal.

And in point of fact,

Mr. Timmreck here was not advised of his right to appeal.
And it is also important to note that the mandatory
special parole term is a unique provision which operates
very differently from traditional parole and can result in
incarceration for the entire period of the mandatory special
parole term even if the violation occurs on the last day*

also that the risk of incarceration is not minimal, the
statistics would indicate that between 35 and *J5 percent of
persons placed on parole are subsequently returned to prison
for violations and that approximately two-thirds of those
violations are technical rather than being for commission of
additional felonies.
The government’s argument in this case that particu­
lar prejudice ought to be shown is similar to its argument in
McCarthy that substantial compliance with Rule 11 was suf­
ficient for purposes of direct appeal.

The rejection of

that argument in McCarthy I think applies with equal force
here, because, as this Court noted in McCarthy, a violation
of Rule 11 inherently prejudices the accused because it de­
prives him or her of the rule's procedural safeugards that
are designed to facilitate an accurate determination of the
voluntariness of the plea.
Similarly, the government’s argument that particular
prejudice ought to be shown I think would create a standard
which is more difficult to administer than the objective
standard applied by the Sixth Circuit here.

It would involve

the District Courts in hearings on the question of particular
prejudice, it would involve the courts in — it would be more
time consuming in terms of judicial time, it would be more
difficult to achieve uniform results, and it would make it
difficult to any defendant, regardless of whether the defendant

would in fact have continued with the guilty plea to meet the
burden of proof.
I would hope that the government would concede that
persons plead guilty for numbers of reasons, any number of
reasons, some of which are beyond the comprehensive of ex­
perienced counsel and judges, and that at least in some cir­
cumstances persons would not have continued to offer their
pleas.
The standard that the government, proposes is one
which would make it difficult for all persons, including them,
to sustain their burden of proof.
An objective test would promote judicial economy
by results being determined on the basis of the pleadings,
and it would provide an additional incentive not only to de­
fense counsel and to government counsel on the basis of their
general ethical responsibility, but provide an additional
incentive because of the standard —QUESTION:

for more than that?
MR. MOGILL:

MR. MOGILL:

Had an objective standard been applied

by the District Judge, there would have been no need for a

have entitled Mr. Timmreck to relief in --QUESTION:

You are arguing that in a 2255 you file

a piece of paper and that Is it.
MR. MOGILL:

Depending on the circumstances.

This

has been a violation, that should be sufficient because the
violation Is one which is so fundamental to the defendant’s
offering of a knowing and voluntary guilty plea.
QUESTION:

But don’t you think the government is

entitled to a hearing?
MR. MOGILL:

If an objective standard were adopted,

the government would have an incentive to insure that there
would be no need for further litigation because the government

46
would have an additional incentive, as the Sixth Circuit noted
in its opinion here, to insure that mistakes such as the
judge and both counsel failed to catch here did not occur,
QUESTION:

Mr. Mogill, you don’t cite Stone v.

Powell at all, do you?
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

I do not.
Do you Just dismiss the government's

reliance on that case?
MR. MOGILL:

I think that — I read Stone v. Powell

carefully and I don't think that the government other than
mentioning it in passing is really relying on it in this
case.

I think their primary reliance is on Davis and on Hill.

I think —
QUESTION:
in passing.

Well, they mentioned it more than once

They cited it about six times.

MR. MOGILL:

I think the facts and the issues in­

volved in Stone v. Powell are sufficiently different, dealing
as they do with questions of state-federal relations dealing
with the question of the exclusionary rule, dealing with the
question — and also turning on the opportunity for full
hearing in the state court, that in the preparation of my
presentation it did not strike me as a case that would in­
volve itself in this Court's decision here.

To the extent,

however, Justice Blackmun, that the question does arise, I
think that the question of opportunity for hearing as being

47
critical in Stone v. Powell, is in some respect similar to
the fact that here there was no opportunity, there was no
advice as to the right of appeal and therefore there was no
assurance that the defendant knew of his opportunity to have
a new hearing on direct appeal.
QUESTION:

Well, if the government wins this case,

would it also win a case where the defendant wasn't advised
at all of the sentence and pleaded guilty, no appeal,
collateral attack saying he wasn't advised of his sentence at
all, in violation of Rule 11?
MR. MOGILL:

Obviously that would depend in part on

the grounds that the Court states in support of its decision.
I think that depending on the grounds that this Court were
to choose for rendering its decision in this case, that if
a subjective standard i^ere adopted such as the government is
suggesting, It is entirely possible that a person who was not
advised of the penal consequences who, for whatever reasons,
did not take an appeal and later challenged their conviction,
but who in fact would not have offered a guilty plea, may be
out the door even though as a gut matter they should be
entitled to relief.

That is one of the reasons why the

government's position is —

twenty years, that strikes me as being pretty unfair.

QUESTION;
MR. MOGILL:
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand that.

Right.

Right.
Mr. Mogill, on the other hand, if the

Court said that based upon your representations at the bottom
of page 9 to the court, notwithstandinp’ any other views that
the Solicitor General might have about it, based on that
there was a finding, the judge said I find on this record,
there was a finding and that finding is not clearly erroneous,
then you wouldn't have any open door to the kind you have been
suggesting.
MR. MOGILL:

If I understand the Court's question,

I believe that Judge Peikens' language is somewhat -Inappro­
priate for the reason that anybody, whethe?r it is a judge or
anybody else, is only speculating as to what the defendant
would have done.
QUESTION:
MR. MOGILL:

What you told him I find on this record.
I understand that that is hie language.

What I am suggesting, and I think that in a concurring opinion
In the Paige case, Judge Boreman from the Fourth Circuit says
the point I want to make now, and that is that it is pure
speculation what the defendant would have done, and for the
judge to conclude that Mr. Timmreck would have continued to
offer his plea Is in fact a matter of opinion and can't be
construed as a finding of fact.
QUESTION:

Would the clearly erroneous rule apply

50
to this situation?
MR. MOGILL:

I don't believe that the nature of

that statement by the judge is a finding of fact, so that I
don’t believe the clearly erroneous rule would come into play.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Mogill.

Mr. Geller, do you have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. GELLER:

Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.

First of all,

1 didn’t mean to mislead you. Justice

Stevens, with regard to my answer concerning your ineligibility
for parole hypothetical.

Our approach would be exactly the

same, there would have to be an inquiry, if it were raised on
collateral attack, as to whether the defendant was actually
prejudiced.

Our approach would be exactly the same as the

approach that you took as a member of the Seventh Circuit.
QUESTION:

At least I understood you to say that

if he on such a collateral attack proves that he would not
have entered the plea had he understood it, then you would
agree that was fundamentally unfair and the collateral attack
would be —
MR. GELLER:

Yes, that's right, but I didn’t mean

to -QUESTION:

It wouldn’t mean automatic.

51
MR. GELLER:

-— suggest that it would be automatic.

Secondly, I think that the notion that it is either
not feasible or not seemly to inquire into prejudice when
there has been a defect in the guilty plea proceeding and it
is raised on collateral attack is rebutted by this Court’s
decision in Henderson v. Morgan in 426 U.S., which was a case
of a defective guilty plea proceeding, and everyone agreed
that the defendant in that case had not been told about one
of the elements of the crime to which he pleaded guilty, but
the Court didn’t stop there.

It then inquired to see whether

he might have had that information from somewhere else.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, when you are talking about

prejudice and whether he would have pleaded guilty anyway,
are you talking about at the time he was in court before the
judge?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
So there is no automatic answer for you

against the defendant if a week ago .he was told about the
parole term?

;

MR. GELIyER:

No, that is correct.

You have to

measure voluntariness by what he knew at the time he pleaded
guilty or what he would have done at the time he pleaded
guilty if he had been told what he now claims he should have
been told, and

subsequent events are only relevant I think

in determining whether it is fair to hold him to his plea,

52
which is a separate sort of an inquiry, although an equal
ground for allowing collateral attack.
The final thing I want to say is that Mr. Mogill
made the statement a moment ago, I think in an attempt to
show prejudice for the first time, since his motion never
alleged prejudice, that his client could be imprisoned for
longer than he was told or at least subject to supervision
for longer than he was told.

He can't serve more than 15

years because he got a 10-year prison sentence and a 5-year
special parole term.

Even if he began to serve his special

parole term and after two or three years he violated it, he
couldn't be returned to prislon for more than five years of
his special parole term.

That is not unusual.

Almost every

defendant can make the same claim.

QUESTION:

Let me be sure I understand your.

If

after four years of special parole he violates the-parole,
can he not then go to jail for five years?
MR. GELLER:

That's right, but he would only be in

prison --

QUESTION:

So he could serve more than a total of

15 years.

MR. GELLER:
years.

No, he couldn't serve more than ip

He could be under supervision for
QUESTION:

Okay.

But he could have 15 years of

prison time plus 4 years of parole?

53
MR. GELLER:
any defendant.

That’s right, but that could happen to

Let’s assume a defendant v/ho pleads guilty to

a 15-year felony, it is not a drug case, let’s assume, we
don’t have a special parole problem, and he gets 15 years, he
is told he can get 15 years and he gets 15 years, presumably
no Rule 11 violation.

After 10 years he is paroled, he then

begins to serve his 5-year parole term, after 3 years let's
say he violates the conditions of his parole, the parole
commission could send him back to prison for 5 years, so that
defendant also would serve 15 years in prison and be under
supervision for a couple of extra years, and no one has ever
suggested that those sorts of nuances have to be explained to
a defendant.
QUESTION:

What you are saying is there is no obli­

gation to advise about the consequences of violating parole?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

No one has suggested that is the case.
Yet.

MR. GELLER:

Yet.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:17 o’clock p.m. , the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
