MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.»

We will hear arguments

next in 77-S067* Duren against Missouri.
Mr. Nation* you mciy proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE M. NATION,, ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NATION?

Mr. Chief Justice* and mev it please the

Court s
In March of 1976, petitioner Billy Duren appeared
for trial in the Jackson County Circuit Court.

Appearing with

Mr. Duren was the jury panel. That panel of 53 people included
only five women.

Billy Duren moved to quash the jury panel

on the basis that the Missouri procedure for selecting jurors
violates his right to a reasonably representative crosssectional jury.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Nation., excuse me, there’s a crank

on the side there? you can get that up.
MR. NATION;
QUESTION;

Okay.

Thank you.

\
I think I8m okay.

X mean the microphone.

QUESTION; We can hear you better.
QUESTION;
MR. NATION;

No* up the other way,
Mr. Duren5s motion to quash* filed

before trial* was overruled*

and he was convicted of murder

in the first degree by an all-male jury.
Of course our challenge here is bottomed upon Taylor

4
vs«, Icuis 1 ana<>

Taylor holds first that petitioner Billy

Duren can raise such a challenge concerning women on juries?
and second, that if women are not in juries in sufficient
numbers, Billy Duran’s right to a fair cross-sectional jury
panel has been defeated»
The Missouri court —
QUESTION: Wait a minute»

Did you say on the jury or

on the jury panel?
MR» NATIONS
QUESTIONS
MR. NATION;

On the jury panel»
Not the jury.
The Missouri court and the State here

attempt to distinguish Taylor in two wayss

first, that the

effect of the Missouri system is different than the effect of
the Taylor system,
I will speak to that issue.

My co-counsel, Professor

Ginsburg, will speak to the distinction the State makes with
respect to the operation of the women’s exemption.
The facts of this case speak strongly»
County is 54 percent women.

Jackson

The voter registration rolls are

used to pick the master jury wheel, and we would assume that
the voter registration rolls, through the statistics in our
brief, would mirror the population characteristic of 54 per­
cent.
Each year the voter registration rolls are subjected
to a random computer search, which draws out 70,000 names.

5
These names are then sent questionnaires to determine whether
or not the 70,000 names meet Missouri’s law as to eligibility
for service»

The questionnaire also contains the women9s

exemption„
The first question on the questionnaire is '“State
your sex” and, parenthetically, '"if you are a woman and do not
desire to serve, see the bottom of the page»"
Missouri makes it very easy at this stage for women
to opt off, and they do in significant numbers.
This questionnaire procedure unquestionably causes
the diminution from 54 percent women in the community to the
panel which is 30 percent women
wheel is 30 percent women.

excuse me, the master jury

Our inquiry does not stop there,

however, because women are given a second opportunity to opt
off the juries.
Each week before trial summonses are sent out.

These

summonses compel only the attendance of men to serve on the
juries.

The questionnaire in red

the July Commissioner."
The Jury Commissioner, John Fitzgerald, also testified

words, an excused female.

She was, in Mr. Fitzgerald's

Men, however, their names, if they

fail to appear, would be — their names would be sent to the

6

bailiff or the presiding judge, who would attempt to contact
them ,
This summons procedure is the only reason for the
diminution between the master jury wheel, which is 30 percent,
and the number of women appearing for trial week after weak»
QUESTION:

Mr, Nation, the Supreme Court of Missouri

expressed some dissatisfaction with your numerical claims.
In what posture do you think we find that factual question?
MR, NATION: Well, the Missouri Supreme Court cited
new — can you be specific as to which claim you're referring
to?
QUESTION:

Well, it's the Court's majority opinion,

I don't: have the opinion directly before me, but it's a phrase
that casts some •—* gives some indication it is not satisfied
that you have satisfactorily demonstrated the fact on which you
rely, but goes on to treat it as if you had, and 1 would like
\

MR, NATION:

Yes, There are several things. First,

they didn't like the fact that we used 1970 population
statistics, which of course are the only statistics that are
available.

They didn't like the fact that in the opinion,

that the master jury wheel count was, as they said, only an
unverified pencil sketch. Apparently they forgot to read the
transcript, because there was testimony concerning the actual
count of the jury wheel.
Week after week after week, prior to Billy Duren's

7
trials the panels averaged 14»5 percent women»

They questioned

the statistics, but I believe the statistics in this case are
in such a posture that we can reach the merits certainly,,
Further, a woman is again given an opportunity to
opt off jury service even after she appears — even after she
appears, at any point before she is sworn as a juror»
decidei

She can

to go home.
Petitioner Billy Duren's jury panel in this case of

53 people, with five women? there were almost ten times as many
men on the jury panel as there were women»
Now, the State and the Missouri Supreme Court have
said that these facts are not conclusive»

In sum, what they

want petitioner to do is to prove that there is no conceivable
or even inconceivable reason which would cause this underrepresentations

As was noted in the amicus brief filed by

the Solicitor General, the constitutional provision allowing
women to opt off juries is the only possible explanation for
the under-representation»
QUESTION;

Further, petitioner —

You mean the federal constitutional

provision or the Missouri constitutional —

MR» NATION;

The Missouri constitutional provision»

Further, it is petitioners position that we have
made a prima facie case, that we have shown, first, that the
jury selection procedure in Jackson County is non-neutral, that
women are given an exemption which men are not»

And, second,

8

we have shown that in week after week jury panels appear for
jury service that are only 14.5 percent women in a community
that is 54 percent women.,
QUESTIONS

Is that because of some lesser registra­

tion in the voting process by women?
MR. NATION;

Well, the statistics that are in our

brief indicate that in Missouri men register to vote — 71 per­
cent of the men register to vote, and 69«9 percent of the women
register to vote.

Therefore, I think we can assume that right

around 54 percent will be what the voter role is.
Further, —

MR. NATIONS

That's right.
— you5ve got roughly 70 to 60.
That's correct.
Any explanation for that in the record?
It's 70 to 69 percent.
Well, roughly 70 to 60.
Excuse me, I didn't — what was your

question?
QUESTIONS

Any explanation for why the drawings

MR. NATIONS

I imagine the computer selects people

from the voter registration rolls, and we don't know exactly

9

what percentage of those people selected,, or those people who are
sent questionnaires, are men and women, because obviously some
of the questionnaires never return,,

People either ignore them

or they’re lost, or people have moved away or died»

So we

have no way of knowing who is mailed questionnaires»
But presumably, if it is randomly drawn from voter
registration rolls, it would be about, again, 54 percent
female»
Petitioner Billy Duren asserts here that we have made
a prima facie case, that we have shown a non-neutral jury
selection method and that we have shown under-representation»
Thus, it is now incumbent upon the State, upon the respondent,
to give soma constitutionally permissible reason for the fact
that Billy Duren’s jury panel -was 9 percent women»
There’s one point that I agree with, with respondent

and with the Missouri Supreme Court»
bad as Taylor.
low»

Jackson County is not as

The Taylor panel of one percent was very, very

But X don’t believe a fair reading of Taylor, that Taylor

stands for the proposition that anything above one percent is
constitutionally permissible»

Instead, the thrust of Taylor is

obviously that any system which denies an accused his right to
a panel with reasonably Representative participation of the
elements of society also violates his right to jury trial under
the Sixth Amendment.
The importance of a jury, Your Honor, as everyone knows

10
is that it is the body that is interposed between the accused
and the accusor»

It is our way of guaranteeing a man a fair

trial*, and thuse it must ba woven from the fabric of the
community; that we cannot exclude any identifiable group

,

that

they must be represented on jury panels*, so that the individual
can have a possibility of having these people on

his final

jury»
QUESTION;

Well* where do you get that from?

the Federal Constitution prohibits a State from excluding any
identifiable group?

MR0 NATIONS

Well, the identifiable groups in a common

sense language, in terras of juries and the jury cases, they have
not been recognized as important enough that we need to include
them on j uries«,
QUESTIONS

Don't you think a lawyer can make a much

bigger impact if he’s a member of a jury than a woman as a
woman or a Mexican-American as a Maxican-American?
MR» NATIONS

Wall, perhaps ha might be able to»

However, lawyers are a very small percentage of the community,
and even the possibility of their being on juries is de minimis„

Finally, this system which denies a defendant his
right to a reasonably representative cross-sectional jury
panel violates the Sixth Amendment and should be reversed»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS» RUTH B„ GINSBURG, ESQ»/
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS» GINSBURG%
the Courts

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

12
My argument addresses the citizen’s duty tied to a
defendant's fair cross-section rights and the complete absence
of justification for exempting any woman.
Though Jackson County jury panels are dominated by
men, the Missouri Supreme Court said that the right affected is
unimpaired.

That reasoning,, in two key respects, is topsy­

turvy .
First, the right central in this case, the right
secured by the Sixth Amendment, is the criminal defendant:,
here Billy Duren's right to a fair chance for a jury genuinely
representative of the community's complexion? and, second, the
vaunted women's privilege, viewed against history's backdrop,
simply reflects and perpetuates a certain way of thinking about
women.

Women traditionally were deemed lesser citizens —

QUESTION?

That wouldn’t concern Mr. Dutren, would

it?
MRS. GINSBURG;

Mr. Duran lias a right, to a jury

drawn from a panel reasonably representative of the community.
And as this ~~
QUESTION;

Yes, but he wouldn't be interested in

the factor you mentioned, whether this is fair or unfair to the
women, —
MRS.

GINSBURG;

QUESTION;
called

Yes.

to be called for jury service or not

13

MRS. GINSBURGs

But that was the traditional

justification given by States, first, for excluding women
altogether, and then the second step was providing an exemption
for "any woman", the notion being that women are not really
needed, not really wanted for participation in the democratic
processes of government»
Viewed in that light, this is hardly a privilege,
this is hardly a favor to the supposedly favored class»
But as to the core right

at stake, Judge Seiler,

dissenting below, pointed out that a defendant's fair crosssection right can be meaningful only if it hinges on a
correlative duty, the duty of the citizen to show up for jury
services when summoned.

A privilege to avoid service at whim,

prorainantly advertised and readily available to any woman or
any man or any other large stable distinctive population group
debases, the defendant’s cross-section right. That

right is

real only when the obligation to service is placed 6n citizens
without automatic exemption, based solely on their race, nationed
origin, or sex.
QUESTIONs

I take it that very few doctors serve on

juries in Missouri State Courts, as is true in most States.
Would you regard that as —
MRS. GINSBURG3

Exemptions that apply on the basis

of one's occupation reflect determinations by the State that
certain occupations, for the good of the community, should be

14
pursued uninterrupted»

And it makes no difference whether a

person is male, female, black or whitef it's the neutral
functional category that is excluded, doctor, lawyer, dentist,
clergy, not "any woman15
QUESTIONs

Would that preclude the State from saying

that, without getting into that old cliche about ''woman's place
is in the home”, if the State said, in fact, mothers of small
*

children belong at home, not serving on juries0

Now, suppose

it were narrowed to housewives with children under 16?
MRS» GINSBURG;
QUESTION;

There are several

Would you still have the same problem?

MRS o GINSBURG ;

There are several States that have

exemptions for persons primarily responsible for the care of
young children»
QUESTION?

So that would be husbands or wives?

MRS» GINSBURG;
QUESTION;

That could be husband or wife, yesG

And you —

MRS. GINSBURG;

But by using the term, assuming

that it will be the woman here or in a more general "any woman"
excuse, the STate is providing an ineludable method that; the
male citizens are counted by government as the essential
participants in the administration of justice, but the female
citizens are not so counted? their service is expendable»
I would like to stress —
QUESTION;

Mrs„ Ginsburg, may I ask a question?

15

If we look at it from the point of view of the
defendant? and you take the view? as I think you do? that men
and women are essentially fungible for purposes of jury service?
how is the cross-section hurt if women are excluded?
MRS, GINSBURGs

That was an issue that the Court

addressed in Taylor v, Louisiana.

Yes? men and women are

parsons of equal dignity and they should count equally before
the law? but they are not the same; there are differences
between them that most of us value highly. This Court said
twice? first in Daughtrey v, United States and then in Taylor
v, Louisiana? that there is a certain quality that would
certainly be missing from that jury -*•
QUESTIONS

What is the relevant difference between

men and woman for purposes of jury service? from the point of
view of the defendant?
MRS, GINSBURGs
QUESTION s

What is the relevant —

Yes,

MRS* GINSBURGs

It is that indefinable something «—

[Laughter,3
QUESTIONS
MRS,

That sounds kind of like a stereotyping,

GINSBURGs

I think that we perhaps all under­

stand it when we see it and when sa feel it? but it is not that
easy to describe; yes, there is a difference.
In any event? Missouri's insistence that 9 to 15
percent representation of woman is quite enough ~ although it

16

is an exorbitant argument -- is understandable for the State to
this dciy has urged x*o justification whatever for exempting
"any woman".

Missouri makes no claim that this women’s excuse

is even minimally rational. Thought to overcome a defendant’s
Sixth Amendment rights Taylor held merely rational grounds
would not suffice.

The Court said in Taylor that it is untenable

to suggest it would be a special hardship for a women to perform
jury duty simply because of her sex.
Post~Taylor, then,, a woman’s work, whether at home
or on the job, and the administrative convenience of treating
all women as expendable, these are not even arguable bases for
diminishing the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right by diluting
the quality of community judgment a jury trial provides.
Moreover, eliminating the exemption for "any woman”
clouds not reasonable jury service exemption, only two States,
Missouri and Tennessee, today maintain a solely sex-based
exemption.

Other Missouri exemptions are tied to occupation,

prior service, individual hardship? not to an unalterable
identification each of us is marked with, at birth, and
identification bearing no necessary relationship to one’s
capacity or life situation and therefore inherently unreasonable
as a bcisis for jury duty avoidance.
In sum, no sense at all nourishes Missouri’s solely
sex-based exemption implemented by Jackson County’s prominent
invitation to "any woman" to sign off.

And the Jury Commission-

17
er's assumption, from a woman8s inaction, that she doesn't want
to serve.

Habit, yesy but surely not analysis or actual

reflection accounts for an excuse based simply on a woman's
sex and not on what she does or is capable of doing.
Finally, the Court's 8-to-~l judgment in Taylor leaves
no roof for the Missouri argument that Billy Duren must show
how he, in particular,, might have been disadvantaged by violation
of the fair cross-section requirements.

Selection of a criminal

trial jury from a representative cross-section, the Court held
in Taylcr, is an essential component of a defendant's Sixth
Amendment right.
Neither Missouri nor this Court is at liberty to
apply or dispense with the cross-section rule, based on the
view of prosecutor or of judge, of the strength of the evidence
against a defendant, full respect for the cross-section command
is required of a State, because the constitutional safeguard
is

guaranteed to all, and it may be relied upon by every

person, the most low and the least deserving to the same extent
as the most upright and virtuous.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Ginsburg, somewhere in these briefs,

the opposing briefs, there’s a suggestion that if Mr. Duren
prevails here, the Missouri jailhouse doors might be opened.
Do you have any comment — what is your response to that
suggestion?
MRS. GINSBURG:

I think it's certainly the case that

this objection is available only to the defendants who have
properly raised it below and pursued it on. appeal.,
Moreover, it would be relevant, only in the case of
Jackson Countya

That questionnaire and that summons in the

record that flags and signals repeatedly that women may take
themselves off, those are used only in Jackson County and no
other county in Missouri»

So I would say we are talking about

one county only, about trials post this Court’s decision in
Taylor v. Louisiana, and only in cases where the objection has
been properly raised and pursued under Missouri law»
QUESTION: Do you know what the follow-through in the
Louisiana case was?
MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes»

Billy Joe Taylor was retried

and reconvicted»
QUESTION:

But was that ruling specifically held

and not retroactive?
MRS» GINSBURG:

You held that it was not retro-

active»
QUESTION:

And so the result is that the Louisiana

jails were not opened? and you think this would follow here
also?
MRS» GINSBURG:

In Taylor v» Louisiana, you over­

turned a 1961 precedent in Hoyt v. Florida»
QUESTION:

But you would think, you would argue,

I suppose, that Taylor mandated invalidation of the Missouri

19

law?
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTIONs

Well, I certainly think soe

And that this ought to go back at least

to Taylor?
MRS. GINSBURGs
QUESTIONS

At least, yes,

Yes,

MRS. GINSBURGs

Although that’s not a necessary part

of the case that’s here today,

Yes, 'chat was the message that

New York got, and other States, all States except Missouri and
Tennessee got that message.
To conclude, tha unconstitutionality of Missouri's
excuse for "any woman'5 as it operates to distort Jackson
County jury panels .is plainly established.

Any sensible reading

of this record juxtaposed with this Court's 8-to-l judgment
in Taylor lead ineluctably to that conclusion,
QUESTION;

You won’t settle for putting Susan B,

Anthony on the new dollar then?
[Laughter,]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I think you have no juris­

diction to make that concession, Mrs. Ginsburg.

Thank you,

Miss Laughrey„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS NANETTE LAUGHREY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MISS LAUGH REY;
the Court;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

20

I think there are three issues that we have to address
herea

First of all, does Missouri's jury selection system

systematically exclude women?

Which I believe is what was held

in Taylor vs» Louisiana to be unconstitutional if it resulted
in jury panels which are almost totally male0
I think we also have to find out what degree of
disparity must be proven in order to make out a violation of
the Sixth Amendment»

And I think there’s also a question as

to the allocation of the burden of proof in these cases»
I will first address the question as to whether
Missouri's jury selection system systematically excludes women»
I think there is a distinct factual difference between
our system and the Louisiana system, in that in Louisiana women
were not included in the jury wheel, tinless they took
affirmative action» There was an assumption that they were not
interested»
In Missouri, on the other hand, women, are treated at
the inception of the process in exactly the same way as are men»
The voter registration lists are u3ed,, and names are selected
at random from those lists and questionnaires are sent out»
QUESTION; Are you suggesting that they are generally
in the category of physicians and others who, it was conceded by,
I think, your friends on the other side of the table, would be
a permissible exclusion on the part of the States for reasons
of public policy?

21

MISS LAUGHKEY :

I think an exemption does not exclude

women or doctors, it gives them the opportunity not to partici­
pate if they choosea
QUESTIONS

Well, whether you call it exemption or

exclusion, since it gives the woman the opportunity to get off
the jury more readily than it gives other people, carpenters
and bookkeepers, then why is it different — you suggest it is
essentially the same as that dispensation given to physicians?
Is that part of your argument?
MISS LAUGHREY;

Yes, Your Honor, it is essentially

the same as any exemption which the State of Missouri grants„
QUESTIONS

Well, wasn't it true that: they have —

the woman has two, a woman doctor has two exemptions0
MISS LAUGHREY%
QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor«

And you don’t see anything wrong with

that?.........................................................
MISS LAUGHREY5

I think it is wrong if there is a

violation of the Sixth Amendment,

I don't think the question

is whether the fact that we give women a special privilege
is wrongo

I think it’s a question of whether, as* a result of

that, Billy Duren’s Sixth Amendment rights were violated,
QUESTIONs Well, isn’t that a direct result of his
having only 0,9 women on the jury, the direct result of the
Missouri practice?
MISS LAUGHREY%

Your Honor, we would submit that

22

no, it is not,, and petitioner:
QUESTION;

has

not shown it to be„

Well, what would cause it?

Where you have 54 percent of the population, what
would make it possible to have such a small amount to serve
on juries?
MISS LAUGHREY:

Petitioner — Your Honor, we do not

believe that it is the obligation of the State to show why
there were so few women on the jury, but rather that the burden
of proof was on the petitioner,,
QUESTIONs

Well, if you are unreasonably requested

to do so, can you?
MISS LAUGHREY;
QUESTIONz

You can't justify it, can you?

MISS LAUGHREY:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, because —

What do you mean by justification?

What the word say3a

........ MISS LAUGHREY:

The reduction in the number of women'

available, or the reasons for the exemption?
QUESTION: The reason for the exemption, one —MISS LAUGHREY:

One, no.

The exemption originally

was given because of the presumed role of women in the home,
and that there ware so many women in that situation that they
should be given an exemption0

Also there was some intimation

that women should be given a choice as to whether they wanted
to participate in the selection of juries, where certain
details might be described that they were uncomfortable in

23
hearing „
QUESTIONs

And at a time when they weren't even

qualified to vote*
MISS LAUGHREYs

Yes, Your Honor, that is true, and I

think the Court in the past has characterized those ■—
QUESTION s

Or to make contracts — or to make

contracts?
MISS LAUGHREYs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think that ~

They just couldn't do anything but tend

home .
MISS LAUGHREYs

I think the question, Your Honor, is

not whether we can justify the exempt:.on, because we only
need to justify the exemption once it has been shown to be a
violation of the Sixth Amendment, and once it has been shown
to operate in such a way that there are so few women on the
jury panel that it is no longer fairly representative of the
community.
And it is our belief that the figures in this case
are sufficient to show that there was a fair cross-section
of women in the community on the panel.
We would point to the fact that there were 29 percent
women on the master jury wheel, even after women were given
the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire and take their
exemption, it was still 29 percent women, which is three times
more than the situation in Taylor vs. Louisiana.

24

There were 15 times more women on the venires than
there were in Taylor vs, Louisiana»

In Taylor you stated that

it would be a violation if we could — if it were shown that
the exemption or the exclusion resulted in almost totally
male panels.
We submit to you that almost totally male is not an
accurate characterization of the panels which tried Billy
Duren and which are used in Jackson County, Missouri,
As I said before, I agree that what once were
justifications for our exemption may be outmoded and archaic,
and yet it seems to me that the basis of the petitioner's
position is that Billy Duren somehow was deprived of a fair
and impartial trial because of the undefinable something that
distinguishes men and women,
I submit that is equally outmoded and archaic, and
not a basis for finding a violation of the defendant's
Sixth Jmnendment,
QUESTIONS

Didn't Taylor say so?

MISS LAUGHREYs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor, Taylor did say so,

Taylor is based on an outmoded stereotype

is what you8re saying?

Is that your argument?

I think it is, isn’t it?
MISS LAUGHREY;

I submit that is the fact,

I think an important question here also is where the
burden of proof is going to be allocated in these cases.

In

25

other cases which are pending before this Court on petitions
for cert, you are aware that there has been evidence introduced
to show that the reduction from 54 percent to 29 percent on
the jury wheel was the basis of the questionnaires and the
exemption for women.

This, however, is not in the record before

this Court, and we submit that it should not be considered by
this Court, since it was not considered by the Missouri Supreme
Court in. the making of their decision,
Even, however, if you do consider that evidence,
there is still no explanation for the diminution of the amount
of women from 29 percent to 15 percent, because, we submit
that if a woman has a right to check the questionnaire and
say, "I don't want to serve13, and she doesn't, then we can't
assume that she is later, when she's called to serve, going
to say "Well, the only reason I’m not interested in serving is
because I am a woman,”

And there is no proof in the record

here ass to why women were excused for cause by the judge, as
evidenced in the tables which are in the Appendix,
QUESTIONS

Miss Laughrey, let me get back for a

moment, if I may, to your comment about the outmoded stereotype
in response to Justice Stevens’ question.

Actually juries —

lawyers who pick juries operate largely on stereotypes, don't
they?

In the sense that, you know, people of certain

nationalities are believed to award higher personal injury
verdicts than others, and other types are supposed to be more

26

favorable to criminal defendants, others kind of hardhearted
and favorable to the prosecution» There may be very little to
them, to the stereotypes, perhaps, that are not justified?
but certainly a lot of lawyers use them in the picking of
juries, and using their preemptory challenges»
MISS LAUGHREYt
know»

That may be, Your Honor, I don't

Is there a question?
QUESTION %

Well, the question -- you say, in effect,

that it didn't make any difference to Billy Duren that there
weren't that many women on the jury because there really isn't
much —■ the concept that women would react differently than
men is outmoded»

Or do I misinterpret your answer?

MISS LAUGHREYs

No, that was correct. Your Honor»

I think, though, that when we're talking about a
violation of the Sixth Amendment and saying that he did not
have a fair and impartial trial, that — and not allowing the
State of Missouri to justify their exemption on the basis of
outmoded and archaic ideas, it seems rnconsistent to rely on
those kinds of ideas to fashion the Sixth Amendment violations»
I'd like to discuss the question of burden of proof
for a minute, as it relates to the reduction of women from
29 to 15 percent mid from 54 to 29 percent»
The Solicitor General would like this Court to say
that there's some kind of a prima facie case made out when
you shew a non-nautral selection process»

And you show under-

27
representation<>

And they try to relate this to the situation

in which this Court has found discrimination in exclusion of a
particTilar group from a jury on the basis of a lower representa­
tion of that group and a non-neutral selection process} a
subjected selection process,, and have shifted the burden to the
State,
We submit that there is no .reason to make such an
allocation of the burden of proof in these cases because of the
fact that the same situation is simply inapplicable here
that is applicable in a discrimination case.
When you're talking about trying to point at some
place in a subjective process where discrimination has
occurred, it is impossible for the defendant to go into that
process and find out at what point that happens , and therefore
there is a reason for developing these rules about the prima
*■

facie case and shifting the burden of going forward with the
evidence to the State,
We submit that there is no fsimilar reason here, that
there is nothing in our process which makes it easier for the
State to show why it is not the exemption for women than it
is for the defendant to shot* that it is the exemption for
women that results in the under-representation.
As evidenced by the fact that they have counted the
questionnaires, they have found out the reason as far as other
cases go

28

QUESTION s

Suppose it was thought that a prima

facie case had been made out, does the State

what’s the

State’s strongest argument in justification?
Or do you have one?
MISS LAUGHREYs

Are you talking about justification

for the exemption?
QUESTIONS

Yes,

For treating women different than

men in terms of excuse0
MISS LAUGHREY;

We recognise that women still play

a primary role in the home, and that even though women may in
fact be working mothers, does not mean that they have been
relieved of the responsibilities of their obligations to the
home or to their family»

And that just because they work is

not a sufficient reason for saying that they no longer carry
the responsibilities that they were once thought to have»
QUESTION:

Is that a legislative

do you think

that’s a legislative decision?
MISS LAUGHREYs

The justification for this exemption

I don't know what the legislative justification was, we do not
have any evidence»

I submit that that is the strongest

justification that the State of Missouri can make for the
exemption»
QUESTIONWell, under McGowan v, Maryland, if there
was any rational reason for it, we give that considerable
weight, I suppose, would we?

Should we?

29

MISS LAUGHREY;
protection case,

Yes f but again it9s not an equal

I don9t think the question is whether our

exemption is good or bad, it's the question of whether it fits
into the mold of Taylor vs« Louisiana»

And in Taylor vs»

Louisiana there were certain statements about what made out
a violation of the Sixth Amendment»

There had to be systematic

exclusion of women»
We submit that there was not exclusion of women here,
because we did not assume that they were not going to serve on
juries merely because they did not opt in to the jury selection
process»
I would like to point to one place in the petitioner9
reply brief that I think is an inaccurate characterization of
the fact»

On page 3, they indicate that if women do not

return their questionnaires and do not respond to the Jury
Service summons, it is assumed that they do not want to serve»
And that is not true»

If a woman does not return her question­

naire, she is automatically put in the pool from which juries
are selected»
The second pari of that statement is true.

If a

woman does not respond to the summons, they do assume that
she's going to exercise her right to an exemption»

Rut I think

there is a distinct difference between a process which at the
beginning does not include woman in the jury selection system,
and a process at the end which does not send the police out

30

to arrest women because they may have used their exemption,, is
a distinct factual difference,,
I think also if you look at the statistics in the
Appendix, in the tables which petitioner has provided, you
will see that the number of women who dod not respond to
summons is insignificant in comparison to the number who have
appeared for jury duty, who are excused, and for other reasons,
and end up appearing on the jury wheel.
QUESTION;

What happens to a man who does not

respond to a summons?
MISS LAUGHREY;

The testimony is that the police

will make an attempt to find out why he has not responded»
QUESTION:

Well, if they find him and he says, WI

just didn't want to serve”
MISS LAUGHREY:

There is a distinction at that

point„
QUESTIONs

And he tells the police, "I just didn't

want to serve? that’s the reason I didn’t respond»"
Then what happens to him?
MISS LAUGHREY:

He is subject to being held in

contempt of court»
Now, in the record in this case, there is no great
discussion about how many men in fact are found to be held in
contempt, of court or whether they do anything about it,,
I would point you, however, to a footnote in the petitioner's

31
reply brief, page 2, footnote 1, when they talk about the St*
Louis :jury system and state that if we were to amplify, v/e
would indicate that in St* Louis they do not assume,from the
fact that woman do not answer the summons , that they do not
to serve*
?
In talking with Mr* Ruland, who is the author of the

authority which thay cite, the situation in St* Louis is that
for a period of time they experimented and they went out and
tried to find out why people did not show up* And if a woman
did not show up, they did nothing to her*
i*ay as in Jackson County*
QUESTIONs

In exactly the same

What they really —

Is Jackson County Kansas City?

MISS LAUGHREY:

Jackson County is Kansas City,

Missouri *
QUESTIONS

How many counties are there in Missouri?

MISS LAUGHREYs
to

that question*

Your Honor, I do not have the answer

There are more than a hundred*

Jackson County, Missouri, of course is one of the
largest population areas*
QUESTION; So a case based on statistics from

Jackson

County, although it would affect a substantial number of people
in Missouri, would not be determinative of other convictions
jf

obtained in other counties, I take it?
MISS LAUGH REY:

1 Miink that: is the — certainly the

import of Taylor is that it is only when it results in an under-

32

representationo

In a particular case»

And

if it doesn't

result in under-representation in St» Louis or Boone County,
does that mean that, you know, the exemption is still valid»
QUESTIONs

So a federal habeas judge sitting in the

Western District of Missouri may be scanning convictions of —
if the Supreme Court of Missouri is reversed here — fifty
different counties, and he's going to have to get evidence as
to the functioning of the jury system in each of those counties
before he can decide»
MISS LAUGHREY:

Well, that's true, Your Honor, but

we would submit that even if the Missouri Supreme Court were
reversed in this case, that this is not a situation that
should be made retroactive? that we think that the rules which
were applicable in Taylor vsa Louisiana are equally applicable
in this case, for two reasons;

No» 1, because of the factual

distinctions between Taylor vs, Louisiana and the situeition in
Missouri, we do not think that Taylor is so dispositive of
the question that we can just say this is an application of
Taylor? we submit that it is an extension of the rationale in
Taylor»
Largely because it's based on statistics»

We never

know what is going to be a fair cross-section of the community,
Your Honor»

We know that one percent is too small, and we

know that 54 percent would be an exact mirror»
where, in between that, the Sixth Amendment

We never know

violation occurs»

33

And therefore to say that it's merely an application of Taylor,
I do not think is correct,
?

And before , you have stated in Daniel

and in Stoical 1

?

vso Penno, the standard that you want to consider when you" re
deciding whether something is retroactive or not.

Two of

the standards, in addition to our reliance on prior law, would
be the interest that the constitutional provision was intending
to protect? and, as you stated in Daniel, you're not
submitting that Billy Duren was prejudiced in any way,

That,

you know, it may not have made one iota of difference to
Billy Duren whether there were women in his pool or on his
jury or whatever.
So there is not the kind of inherent prejudice and
problems that would be where a defendant is denied the right
to an attorney during the process of a trial,
QUESTION: Are you hinting at a harmless error, even
assuming all that your friends say, that it's harmless error?
MISS LAUGHREY:

No, Your Honor,

We, of course,

submit that. v;e do not think that there is any prejudice in
this case,

' .>
QUESTION:

No, an alternate — I wondered whether

you were making an alternative argument, that this is
harmless error even if otherwise —
MISS LAUGHREYs

No, I*m saying that if you decide

that it was error and it was unconstitutional, and you are

34
considering whether it is retroactive or not, you look at the
question of what did the constitutional provision protect,
and in Daniel you indicated that what the Sixth Amendment fair
cross-section

protects is not of the kind that would

necessitate a retroactive application,
The third most important thing is what happens if
you make this retroactive.

The petitioner has tried to minimize

the effect that it would have on the administration of

justice

in Jackson County by saying that it is only one county in
Missouri.

I am sure that this Court is aware of — that half

the population of the State of Missouri is in the metropolitan
Kansas City area.
QUESTION:

I didn't know that,

MISS LAUGHREY:

And that there is going to

be a ■

substantial undermining of the administration of justice in
Jackson County, Missouri,
QUESTION:

And what percentage of the convicts who

ware convicted in Jackson County -- what percentage of those
still in, who have been convicted since Taylor are still there?
MISS LAUGHREY:

Your Honor, we of course do not have

those statistics at this time.

You are aware, though, of how

many petitions for cert have already been filed in this Court,
that they are in limbo at this time, that the petitioner can
certainly tell you that there is certainly more than 150 cases
in which this issue has been raised and in which the statistics

35

have been made out.
And one of the issues that you indicated that you
would consider in Stowall vs» Denno, Daniels vs» Louisiana, is
the effect on the administration of justice»

And to make the

State of Missouri re-try all of those cases would have a
devastating effect on the administration of justice in our
S tate «
QUESTION;

Daniels y0 Louisiana was the case that

held the Taylor doctrine not retroactive?
MISS LAUGHREY:
QUESTION s

That is correct , Your Honor,,

I don't ~ is it cited in your brief?

MISS LAUGHREYs

No, it is not»

We did not discuss

If there are no further questions,

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well»

Do you have anything further, Mr» Nation?
MR» NATION s

Yes »

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We seem to have — there

36

saems to be a disagreement on the factual situation between
you and the State, about women who do not return their question­
naires,,

She says they are automatically put in, you said they

were automatically out»
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEE M. NATION, ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» NATIONS

The statement made in our reply brief

was that women ’who do not return the questionnaires and who
do not follow the request of the summons do not appear for
jury service »
QUESTION: That isn’t quite the way you put it in
your oral argument»

I think there was a little —

MR» NATIONS

It was something like that in the

brief, that — yes, that's the reason that the wheel is as
high £B it is, that’s the reason there are 29 percent women
on the wheel; is because if they don't return the questionnaire,
they are put onto the wheel, and then they opt off when they
receive the summons»
I'm not sure what we could further prove prior to
trial, to prove a case, I believe, under the precedents of
this Court, a prima facie case has been made»

We showed a non-

neutral selection procedure, and we showed marked under­
representation of women»
Nov/ it is incumbent upon the State to come up with
some reasonable explanation»

And attributing the fact that 14»5

37
percent of jury panels could possibly be random chance, or
something else, the possibility of that happening is infinitesi­
mal o
QUESTION?

You don't claim that the Missouri statute,

though, is unconstitutional in all situations? it has to be
accompanied by your Jackson County statistical showing*
MR* NATION %

Well., under Taylor you have to prove

that there is an exemption and that there is under-representai

tion®

No statute is per s© unconstitutional? but in its

effect here in Jackson County, it is*
Further, the only reason
QUESTION:

That is because of your statistical

showing as well as because of the practices and procedures in
Jackson County?
MR® NATION 2
QUESTION;
MR® NATSONs

Yes®
I see®
The exemption is the same for other

counties in the State, but other people hide the exemption
from their women®
QUESTION2

In a specific case could this ever, in

your view, be harmless error?
MR® NATION?

Only in a case where there is absolutely

no question of credibility for the jury*

In any case where

the jury has to determine the credibility of witnesses, it is
impossible to say that it’s harmless error or harmless constitu-

38

tional error.
QUESTIONs

Well, what if a defendant on the stand,

under cross-examination, as has happened in some cases, testified in a way that it added up to essentially a judicial
confession of the crime, would you think that would be the kind
that could be harmless error?
MR* NATIONS

Well, Your Honor, as a criminal defense

lawyer, I have occasionally had instances where my client -the only reason where a trial is not to contest the facts
but to try and receive a light sentence, because in Missouri
the jury sentences*

And it's my experience that women are

much more sympathetic towards defendants than men are*
So in that instance, even in that situation, —

No, I don't think they are fungible*
I think we're going to get in a lot of

MR* NATIONS

There is -- I don’t know how many,

uhere are seven, .. believe, petitions for certiorari on this
issue before the Court. And I have nowhere near 150 cases? but
I am not sure what the number is.

Bui: we believe as far as

xereactivity that this case falls squarely under Taylor, and
that anyone who raised it prior to trial introduced evidence,

requested the court to quash the jury panel and give him a
reasonably representative jury at trial, should be afforded a
