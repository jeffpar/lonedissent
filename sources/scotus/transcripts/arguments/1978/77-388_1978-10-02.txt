ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT;»
MR. GORTONs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the courts
The Yakima Reservation is an extensive tract of land
in Central Washington of core than 2,000 square miles, almost
the size of the State of Delaware.

Four--fifths of that land

is held in trust or restricted status by the United States for
the benefit of the Yakima Nation.
removed from

The other one-fifth has been

trust status end sold almost entirely to

non-Indians.
Most of the fee land is located in the Northeastern
portion of the reservation, as shown in gray on the map which
is Exhibit 34 in the record,.
The population of the reservation was stipulated in
the pretrial order in this case to be about 25,000, of which
3,000 were members of the tribe.

Since the date of that pre­

trial order, the members of both groups have increased.

4
Indians and non-Indians live together on most of the
inhabited portions of the reservation, but most of the nonIndians live on

fee lands near the Yakima River,

The Indian

population is scattered more evenly throughout the non-forested
portions of the Reservation,
Two small cities, Toppenish and Wapafco, are located
entirely inside the Reservation borders.

Each of those cities

has an Indian population of slightly less than ten percent, and
each of them is located almost exclusively on fee

MR. GORTONs

Yes.

agricultural use and has been leased to non-Indians.
QUESTIONS

By the Tribe?

MR, GORTONs

Yes.

In addition, to

City police officers in Toppenish and

Wapato, the law enforcement system includes about 40 deputy
sheriffs, almost twice the number

who were on the force at the

time of the trial, a considerable Tribal «colice force, and a
State patrol detachment with headquarters at Toppenish,

are cross

All deputy sheriffs and all State patrolmen

All Tribal police are

cross-deputized by the Sheriff with authority for arrest within
the exterior boundaries

of the Reservation

5
And many of the officers of each carry Federal
commissions from the B1A as well»
Thus the bugaboo of checker-boarding and the use of
tract books which is a constant refrain of the Tribe and the
Solicitor General is therefore just that, a bugaboo.

As

several of the Sheriffs deputies testified almost any law
enforcement officer can make an arrest anywhere on the Reservation for any criminal offense^ whether the offense is to be
tried by a Tribal Court, a State court or a Federal District
Court is decided later by lawyers.
QUESTION:

But does it not depend on what laws are

applicable, whether there has been a crime?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Yen, it does.
Well then, the arresting officer must

know three sets of laws?
MR. GORTON:

The arresting officer in at least 99

percent of all cases is not going to need to know three sets
of laws at all.

Generally speaking a traffic offense is going

to be an offense against each of the two.

It would not be

in violation of the -QUESTION:

But it does depend on what law is applicable,

whether there has been a crime?
MR. GORTON:

It does depend on what law is applicable,

whether there has been a crime.
QUESTION s

Is there anything in the materials that

6

have been submitted to us indicating what percentage of kinds
of conduct might be a criminal offense under one or more of
these laws and not be under the other?
MR. GORTON:
Obviously,

I do not believe that there has been»

by far the fewest offenses would be offenses of

Federal Criminal Code offenses, because those are only the major
crimes.
The largest number of offenses would presumably be
State offenses because its jurisdiction is the broadest.
The Tribal offenses, of course, are limited to minor
crimes with the penalty of not more than six months in jail.
QUESTION:

But anything that readily comes to mind

such as assault and battery or stealing or larceny would
presumably be an offense under both State law and County Code?
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

And so the Deputy Sheriff can

arrest and if it is under the jurisdiction of the Tribal Code,
the lawyers will decide tkat that is where! the offender goes.
If it is under the State Code, the offender will go to a County
jail and be tried in a County Superior Court or District Court.
Yakima County, however,

does have some difficulty

in making arrests on much of the trust land because the portion
of the Reservation west of the line roughly like that is closed
by Tribal action to non-Indians.
Perhaps it goes without saying that this is not a
racial discrimination case.

The trial court found no discriminatio!

7
against Indians in the State program of law enforcement, a
judgment which is based in part on the explicit testimony as
to the absence of such discrimination from the Chief of the
Tribal police force himself.
The complaints of the Yakimas about inadequate law
enforcement

protection are identical to those of non-Indians

in Yakima and throughout the Nation,
them.

There is not enough of

Why is there never a police officer around when you

really need one?
As the court is aware, we do not regard the order
noting probably jurisdiction as encompassing the assertion of
the Tribe and the Solicitor General that Washington was required
to amend its constitution in order to assume jurisdiction under
Public Law 280.

Your order omits that question, of course, for

the very good reason that you have already decided it in oar
favor on three different occasions;

in Makah, Tonasket and

in. Comenout.
Nevertheless, that disclaimer cause argument repre­
sents the principal submission of our opponents, occupying some
60 percent of the 162 pagus of argument in their three briefs.
Our reply brief 'for this reason demonstrates that your
three decisions

on the subject were correct.

Even before one

reaches the argument, however, that the enabling Act and our
State constitution still prohibit our assumption of jurisdiction,
4

one must first decide just what lands are covered geographically

8

by the disclaimer clause language as well as what type of
governmental power or jurisdiction the State was mandated to
disclaim in 1889.
QUESTION:
these dismissals.

General Gorton, you have just referred to
In your brief on page L7 I read:

"These dismissals constitute rulings on the merits,
which the court should now reconsider."
MR,, GORTON:

We refiled the correction changing the

"W" to a "T*.
QUESTION:

Well, we didn't get one.

MR. GORTON:

Under the enabling act language in our

State constitution, Washington disclaims and I quote:
"All right and, title to all land s owned or held by
any Indian or Indian tribes.

And un oil the title thereto

shall have been extinguished by the United States, said
Indian land shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction
of the United States,"
The United States title to fee Lands on the reserva­
tion has been so extinguished.

The disclaimer clause thus is

not applicable to those fee lands.
Solicitor General

concede

full jurisdiction over fee

And even the Tribe and the

that Washington has acted to assume
lands.

Fee lands are, therefore, not covered by the disclaimer
clause or by a debate over: the existexxce or validity of partial
jurisdiction.

9

Next what substantive forms of jurisdiction are covered
by the disclaimer clause.

In an 1896 decision,: Draper almost

contemporaneous with our enabling act, this Court held that
enabling act disclaimers do not encompass the type of criminal
and civil jurisdiction envisaged by Public Law 280 at all.
Draper arose in Montana, which shares the same
enabling act with Washington.

These arguments are, of course,

academic because you have three previous

decisions chosen by

Washington to assume jurisdiction under Public Law 280 were
correct.
This is not to say that we entirely disagree with a
basic premise of the Solicitor General in this case.

We agree

with him that the Congress could have required a popular refer­
endum as a prerequisite to assumption of jurisdiction by an
enabling act state or for that matter by any other state if it
had wished to do so in 19^3.
We also agree with the Solicitor General that Congress­
man Westland and others involved in the drafting

of Public

Law 280 assumed that Washington would be required to

amend its

constitution in order to assume jurisdiction.
But

we disagrees that those two facts lead to the

conclusion advanced by the Solicitor General
They contend that Congress

added to a law designed to facilitate

the assumption of jurisdiction by the State an
Federal requirement

and the Trite.

that the handful of those States do so only

?

In the words o:: the Solicitor

General in this case that goal was and I quotes
"To pull down the reservation fences that kept
out

State law,"
We agree.

Congress passed Pubi:.c Law 280 to enable

the States to pull those fences down by removing every Federal
impediment, not

to build new fences.

In fact, some States were required to assume juris­
diction without either legislative or popular approval.

Sam®

other states had constitutional amendments! tied to their
enabling acts.,

Those enabling act impediments were removed

and Congress authorized the amendments of those State constitu­
tions to which they we re tied two important, words as a qualifica­
tion and I quotes

"Where necessary."
s'

Obviously

that phrase "where necessary" implies

t let in some enabling act states a constitutional amendment

was

not necessary,
The phrase is clearly inconsistent with the contentions
that the Congress intended to add the requirement of

a

11
constitutional amendment as a Federal requirement even when no
such requirement existed tinder State law»
for the Subcommittee

In fact, the counsel

which drafted Public Law 280 explained

that that Section 6 granted states permission to amend their
statutes or constitutions where state cour ts deemed such per­
mission to be necessary.
Still other states, those in vhich neither a con­
stitutional nor a staturofcy amendment t as necessary were required
to take affirmative legislative action not including a popular
referendum to show their willingness to assume the burden of
law enforcement on Indian

reservations.

But the Congressional purpose was consistent through­
out all three categories of states, to encourage state assump­
tion, to remove impediments

and

roadblocks, but not to create

them.
In 1959 the Washington Supreme Court decided that no
constitutional amendment was necessary, and has repeated that
conclusion on at least three more occasions.

The Ninth Circuit

agreed in the Quinault case.
QUESTION:

Well now, the Washington Supreme Court

decided that as a matter of State law.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Did it deal with the claim now being made

with the Tribe in the Solicitor General that as a matter of
Federal law it was?

12
MR'- GORTON:

Yes.

It dealt directly with it and

found that it was the legislative history of Public Law 280
together with its precise language and the "where necessary"
clause made it a State law question.
QUESTION:

And. further held it as a matter of State

MR. GORTON:

Exactly.

I am coming to that with my

next point.
The State court's rationale —
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Did you cinish your answer?

Yes.
I want to be sure, in 1957, as I recall,

the State took jurisdiction with the consent of nine of the
tribes as to nine tribes
MR. GORTON:

In 1957 the State legislature passed

a statute to take jurisdiction on any reservation from which
there was a tribal request.
QUESTION:

And there were eight or nine tribes who

made such a request?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Is the Solicitor General’s argument

applied to those tribes as well as to the Yakima Tribe?
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

Half of his arguinent does; his

argument that we were required to amend oar constitution.
The State court s rationale, Mr. Stewart, was that,
though it is technically irrelevant here, the people of

13

Washington speak through their legislature, just as the people
of the United States speak through the Congress.

Our consti­

tution's Article XXVI has not been repealed, but the disclaimer
portion has been rendered, ineffective, just as the Congress
rendered ineffective the enabling act provision on disclaimer
without repealing it or even amending it in express

terms.

This is just whc.t Congress seems to have had in
mind back in 1889 when it passed the single enabling act for
Washington, Montana and South Dakota.
South Dakota1s

equivalent to our Article XXVI states

that the consent of its people is to be "expressed by its
legislative assembly", although a long portion of the Solicitor
General's brief is designed to show that Congress meant that
these amendment act changes would have to be made by a popular
referendum.

But the President of the United States —

President of the United States approved South Dakota's con­
stitution as being in total conformity with the enabling act»
If the Solicitor General's argument is correct, one star should
come out of the flag because South Dakota is not validly in
the Union»
This is exactly what our State Supreme Court inter­
preted our constitutional disclaimer to require.

By 1968,

of course, Congress knew both of our State Supreme Court
decisions and of the similar Ninth Circuit Court decision in
Quinauit.

The Solicitor General himself agreed that the Ninth

Circuit was correct in a brief submitted to you in Quinauit.
The Congress has listened at length to both the legal
and policy arguments of the Yakimas and their supporters on the
subject.

Congress knew that Washington's assumption under

Public Law 280 was both the most significant and the most
controversial of all of the option states

but the Congress

consciously and explicitly in 1968 confirmed pre-existing
assumptions of jurisdiction and obviously meant to include
Washington.
Next, the Tribe and the Solicitor General assert
that Public Law 280 did net authorize what they characterize
as Washington's partial assumption of jurisdiction, but Washington
did not obligate and bind itself to use the terms of the Act
to merely partial jurisdiction but to full jurisdiction.
In fact, it did so twice, in X9£>7 and in 1963.

The

15
Solicitor General quarrels with the manner in which the State
assumed the jurisdiction in 1963.

That year the State obligated

and bound itself to assume full jurisdiction, but it did not
exercise full jurisdiction on the Yakima Reservation because
it made that exercise sub;ect to the consent of the Yakima
Tribe.
We did what Public Law 280 required of us,

even

if Public Law 280 required a State commitment to assume full
jurisdiction, a requirement which is evidenced neither on the
face of the statute nor in its legislative history.
By now incidentally, it should be abundantly clear
that while the formal position of the Trite and the Solicitor
General is that the State exercises too little jurisdiction,
their actual grievance is that it exercises too much.
At any rate, the Ninth Circuit not only upheld the
1963 State statute in Quinault, it characterized it as we do,
as an undertaking to assume full jurisdiction as authorized by
Public Law 280.

That court also focused on the question of

whether or not the State could condition its exercise of full
jurisdiction on tribal consent and decided that it could do
so.
When the Quinaults attempted to bring that decision
before this Court in 1967, the Solicitor General filed a brief
here agreeing with us that Washington's assumption of jurisdiction
■was valid, even though he characterised it as partial.

The

16

Solicitor General still be».lieves that the phrase "in such
manner" in Section 7 of Public Law 280 permitted the State
to condition its assumption of jurisdiction in its entirety
on tribal consent. We can see nothing in that phrase which
forbids state by state flexibility in dealing with the extent
to which each authorises a tribal option.
For that matter, the phrase does; not seem to bar
even a true assumption of only partial jurisdiction, a course
which is actually adopted by five option states.

After all,

the 1953 Congress wished to facilitate the assumption of
jurisdiction by the states and itself provided for a form of
partial jurisdiction in all but one of the mandatory states.
It knew less about the situation in the option states,
while it was actually working in drafting Public Law 280.It is
thus

difficult to believe that Congress was not willing to

permit flexibility in those states and impossible to find such
an unwillingness in the language of the statute or in its
legislative history.
QUESTION a

Does Washington law parmit the amendment

of the Washington constitution by a convention as well as by
a referendum?
MR, GORTONs

What the Washington constitution does

not permit an amendment of our constitution by an initiative.
It permits the legislature to call a constitutional convention
after an affirmative vote of appeal, which can then deal with the

17
constitution as it will.
QUESTION:

At some stage though there is a public

referendum on the proposed amendment to the constitution?
MR. GORTONs

Yes.

Washington thus did not violate Public Law 280 by
the manner in which it obligated itself to assume jurisdiction.
By 1968 the Congress knew of the details of the Washington
system.

It knew that the Yakimas and their supporters objected

to that system strenuously.

Those tribes pressed vigorously

for the right of unilateral retrocession.
The Congress knew of the Quinault decision, validating
the Washington system.

It knew that the Department of the

Interior believed in the validity of that Washington system
and the Interior asserted that partial jurisdiction was not
only a good concept but was authorized by Public Law 280.
Congress heard other witnesses, on the other hand,
who felt that the option of partial jurisdiction was such a
good idea that it should be expressly spelled out in the statute.
In 1268 with this knowledge Congress rejected the Yakimas'
demand for unilateral retrocession, ended the argument over
partial jurisdiction by expressly authorising it, and confirmed
pre-existing assumptions of jurisdiction, of which Washington
had been pivotal during the debate leading up to those 1968
amendments to Public Law 280.
QUESTION:

General Gorton, let me take you back a few

18

steps.

Do I understand from your answer to Mr. Justice

Rehnquist that the constitutional amendment in the State of
Washington must first go through a constitutional convention
called by the legislature and then subject to the vote of the
people?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.
Which is it?
The constitutional amendment in the

State of Washington in the normal, sense is proposed by the
legislature and acted on by the people.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Then in what circumstance —
The legislature may also call for a

constitutional convention which, if it is approved by the
people, then meets and presumably can write an entirely new
constitution.
QUESTION:

Then there is delegated power to the

convention?
MR. GORTON:

The action that a convention would have

to be approved by the people.
QUESTION:

I thought you said to Mr. Justice Rehnquist

that even after the convention drafts the amendment, the
people must

pass on it by a referendum?

MR. GORTON:

That is true.

If a constitutional

convention is calleu into being in the State of Washington,
its actions, if any, would be subject to the approval by the

19

people.

Our point in connection with this case is that

Article XXVI which includes the disclaimer clause has in it
the preamble that it is a compact with the United States, which
cannot be changed without the permission of Congress and the
people of the State.
It is that phrase, "the people of the State”, which
our State constitution has interpreted as meaning the people
of the State acting through their legislature, exactly the
way that South Dakota more expressly provided.

In other words,

we have not amended the Article XXVI of our constitution, our
disclaimer clause, any more than Congress has amended the
enabling act.

But Congress said "not withstanding the enabling

act" you can do what you need to take jurisdiction.

We have

done what we needed to take jurisdiction and we did not need
to amend Article XXVI in order to do that.
QUESTION:
with "by the people".

General Gorton, I have a little problem
Could the legislature amend the con­

stitution?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

No.
Is that right?
Correct.
So "by the people" means not the legisla­

ture?
MR. CARTON:
QUESTION;

No.
Well why did it not say that it could be

20

by the legislature?
Congress"?

Why did it say "by the people and the

Why could it not have said "the legislature and

Congress”?
MR. GORTON:

Legislation is often preceded when it

passes the legislature by the people of the State that acts
— hereby enacts the following Code of lav.
QUESTION:

IBm not talking about that.

I'm talking

about a legislative document talks about one legislative body,
Congress, and then says the people and talks about the other
group.

If they meant the legislature, could not they have said

the legislature in Washington and the legislature of the United
States?
MR. GORTON:
by Congress.

The enabling act was, of course, passed

The United States neither then or today has any

power of referendum or any submission directly to the people
for votes.
QUESTION:

But in this instance the legislature of

Washington can in effect amend the constitution?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

No, I am not.
What are you saying?

Congress took — gave its permission.

It wiped out its side

its entirety.

It says "notwithstanding tne

And that means notwithstanding the reference to

21

Congress and notwithstanding the reference to the people; notwithstanding the enabling act, a State may amend its constitution
where necessary in order to take jurisdiction»
Now the same phrase appears as a preamble to Article
XXVI.

The State Supreme Court in interpreting Article XXVI,

not the enabling act — in interpreting Article XXVI said that
under the laws and constitution of the State of Washington,
the people speak through the legislature.
Now Congress approved that thinking in 1889 because
they accepted it from South Dakota.
QUESTION s

Then you think that in Washington — the

Supreme Court of Washington said that the State can speak through
its people through the legislature?
ME. GORTON%

Yes, in connection with removing any

impediment to take jurisdiction on an Indian reservation.
QUESTION *

so then the State of Washington says that

any provision for the protection of the Indians in the constitu­
tion can be amended by the legislature?
MR. GORTON;

No.

If that Article of the constitution

had not had such a preamble which authorized the legislature
to act presumably as long ago as 1889 when Congress had given
its consent, that answer weuld not have obtained in the State
Supreme Court.
QUESTION;

I guess we are bound by the State of

Washington interpretation

of what is meant by —■

22

MR. GORTON:

The question here is whether or not there

was an independent Federal requirement.

Yes, you have always

allowed State. Supreme Courts to interpret State constitutions.
The question here is whether or not this was a Federal require­
ment,

Our position is the Federal requirement was totally

wiped out by the Congress when it passed 'Public Law 280.
What it wanted to do, it gave the State the permission
to do whatever State lav; required to get rid of its disclaimer
clause language.
The failure of the Solicitor General to join the
Tribe in defending the Ninth Circuit Panel's decision overturning
the State law on equal protection grounds speaks volumes.

MR, GORTON:

QUESTION:. Correct.
But your opponents made no cross appeal?
MR. GORTON:

No, they did not.

In fact, the State choice was not only not irrational?
it was both reasoned and logical.

It tied the tribal option -—

the tribal choice of law to Indian lands cr to lands under
Indian control.

Most non-Indian

residents and businesses on

the Reservation are located on fee land? cost transactions between
Indians and non-Indians, like those involved in your cases of
Williams versus Lee and Kennerly take place on fee land, as no
doubt do most Indian claims against non-Irdiars for consumer
fraud.
Most traffic offenses and minor crimes by both Indians
and non-Indians which affect one another in an integrated,
society take place on fee land.

Thus, it

was on fee land —

with fee land that the legislature was most concerned about

25
establishing a uniform system of law.
Obviously that concern affected Indian lands as well *
in the

of traffic offenses and various social

programs administered and financed by the State, but there the
Indian desire for tribal self-government was a major counter­
vailing consideration.

So in the classic manner of all legis­

lative bodies, the Washington legislature compromised the
demands of those who wanted plenary State jurisdiction

every­

where and the tribes who wanted no State jurisdiction anywhere.
The Ninth Circuit Panel decision from which this
appeal is taken found as e basis for its equal protection holding
that a Yakima Indian living on trust land received no law
enforcement protection from the State while his Indian neighbor
on fee land did.

That is a fatally erroneous view of the

effect of the State law.
State law does protect a member of the Yakima Tribe
on trust land from anyone except a fellov member of the Yakima
Tribe, and that omission is due solely to the choice which
the Tribe has made.
Even in that situation the Tribal member is treated
exactly as is a non-Indian on trust land who also lacks State
law protection as against a member

of the Yakima Tribe.

The

distinction is not based on a difference in the need for legal
protection by the State, but on the State's concern in 1963
for the preservation of a maximum of tribal self-government.

26

In Antelope less than two years ago this Court held
that the use of land status is the basis for the choice of
which criminal law is applicable to an Indian did not constitute
a denial of equal protection.

It was simply of no consequence

that the Federal Criminal Code differed from that of the
surrounding State.
In Antelope that choice of law worked to the detri­
ment of the Indian defendcint.

In this case it works to the

advantage of the Indian who prefers Federal or Tribal juris­
diction to that of the State.
And. in footnote 13 of. Antelope you recognized that
a similar choice of law question would be involved on almost
any military base.

Actually scores of military reservations

throughout the United States are divided into not two but three
types of jurisdiction;

exclusive Federal, exclusive State and

concurrent jurisdiction, depending on the date and circumstances
under which the United States acquired its title.
That haphazard mixture is apparently of no con­
stitutional significance and .in addition to that it seems to
work.

There are, of course, some limits to the tribal option

offered by the State even on Indian land, the eight subjects
enumerated in RCW 37.12.010.

The Tribe attacks that form of

what it calls partial jurisdiction as well, as the geographical
distinctions based on trust status as an unconstitutional
depravation of equal protection and due process.

27
I have already discussed the rationale for the State8s
handling of those eight subjects on trust lands, but that same
rationale caused the Congress in 1929 and again in 1946 in
25 U. S. Code 231 to authorise the states
matter jurisdiction

partial subject

on Indian reservations over health regula­

tions and compulsory school attendance.
And in 1968 the Congress amended Public Law 28D
expressly to permit partial subject matter jurisdiction with
consent over any subject.

By reason of those 1963 amendments

to Public Law 280, partial, retrocession is also possible, but
to the best of our knowledge no such request of the State legis­
lates e has ever been made by the Yakima Tribe.
Clearly the tools now exist for a flexible approach
to State jurisdiction and it is difficult to conceive that
their use

to accommodate both Indians and non-Indians either

now or in the past would constitute a den Lai of equal protection
or due process to either group.
Finally, the subject matter of this controversy has,
of course, been before the. Congress alraosr continuously for
two centuries, and will without doubt be considered there again
and again.
The Solicitor General and the Tribe, therefore, ask
you to frustrate the obvious intention of both the 1953 and the
1968 Congresses and of the Washington Stare legislature.

They

assert that the practical effects of such a determination would

28

be minimal.

They can make that assertion only by ignoring

reality and by assuming , as the Ninth Circuit Panel did, that
only the tribe is affected by this controversy.
The 1963 legislature in contras-; with what we believe
was a considerable better understanding of the way in which an
integrated society actually operates was concerned with the
welfare of all of its citizens.

It sough: a stable legal system

which recognized the legitimate aspirations of both Indians
and of their non-Indian neighbors.

Instead of wiping out

tribal self-government in the jurisdiction field entirely, as
the Solicitor General believes the State had to do under Public
Law 280, the State substantially preserved it.
Instead of ignoring the desire of reservation nonIndiana for the right to be governed by their own laws — a
demand not unfamiliar to those who live in the District of
Columbia — the legislature granted that right, but not to
its maximum extent without the consent of the tribes whose
members are also voting citizens of the County and the State.
Washington did what it was authorized to do by Public
Law 280 and did it well.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. CLAIBORNE

%

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court;
With the Court's permission I will concentrate my

29

argument on the disclaimer point/ that is, the proposition that
the State of Washington could not assert any additional juris­
diction over Indian reservations within its borders without
first amending its State constitution.
QUESTION;

On what grounds do you present this issue?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice White, we take the view,

I hope correctly, that an appellee is entitled to defend the
judgment in his favor under Section 1254.2 of the Judicial
Code on any Federal ground.
QUESTION:

Well, what if your ground, if you succeeded,

if it were sustained would give considerably different relief?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
a problem.

Mr. Justice White, there might be

The relief here, however, would be identical whether

that judgment is sustained on the ground reached by the Panel.
QUESTION:

I thought that if you invalidated on the

ground that you are about to urge, it would invalidate the
entire law, would it not -- Washington's entire statutory scheme?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But Mr. Justice White, so did the

Panel decision in this case.
QUESTION:

On equal protection grounds?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Finding impossible to sever the

permissible and not permissible portions, the Ninth Circuit
struck down the entire Washington law.
QUESTION:

That is the way you interpret, it?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is so, Mr. Justice White.

30

We deal with this matter of jurisdiction, that is,
the propriety of the appellees raising these statutory grounds
on page 15 and 16 of our brief and particularly our footnote
9 thereof.
If I may in the shortness of tine turn to the sub­
stance of the argument.

May I begin in this ways

The suggestion

has been made that the prepositions put from this table frustrate
the true intent

of Congress.

I suggest ho the Court that far

from weaving' any fine spur arguments or erecting any technical
obstacles to defeat what everybody knows

Congress intended

in 1953, we on the contrary are faithful to that Congressional
intent in 1889, in 1953 and in 1968.
That, is demonstrable in at least, two ways, but for
Congress' recognition that Washington had what appeared to be
an impediment in its State constitution, it is predictable
with some assurance that Washington would have been treated
as her neighbor, Oregon, end as four other states -- that is,
V

would have been subjected to automatic or mandatory coverage.
That is because the five states that were so treated
in Public Law 280 were those where the responsible officials
had consulted both the State authorities end the tribes.

And,

therefore, the Department of the Interior was in a position
to say to Congress, "These States want jurisdiction; the tribes
either acquiesce or wish to be exempted."
QUESTION j

Do you not have some problem with the equal

31

footing clause in the distinction between the five states you
are talking about and the other states so that Washington was
not given equal footing when it was admitted to the Union if
your construction is correct?
I mean, to what extent can Congress impose a limitation
on a state sovereignty that is not imposed on other states
and have it survive the adoption of the State constitution of
the submission to the Union, like your Coyle case where Congress
prescribed where the capital of Oklahoma should be located?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I take it

that there would have been no constitutional difficulty in
Congress8 including Washington with the other five, making it
six, just as they did in the case of Alaska, a disclaimer state.
QUESTION:

Well, there would hare been some difficulty

in treating Oregon and Washington differently, would there not?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

But they did.

X am not suggesting

that Public Law 280 is unconstitutional because Oregon was
immediately given jurisdiction, whereas Washington was not.
QUESTION:

But how about the constitutionality of the

enabling act?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am obviously

missing the thrust of your question.

I take it as clear that

Congress could have overridden the disclaimer and indeed the
State constitutional disclaimer in Article XXVI, just as it
did in the case of Alaska which had those impediments and it

32
could have treated Washington as it did Oregon by giving it
immediate
QUESTION:

My question goes further back in that?

and what I am referring is the doctrine of the Coyle case which
is 221 U. S. 559? where the Court said that even though Congress
could insist that a State put something in its constitution
as a condition for coming into the Union? the State may later
repudiate that if the result of not repudiating would be to
give it less of an equal footing than the other states that
were admitted without itMR. CLAIBORNE:

Well? I am not :.n the least attempting

to take on the Coyle case? Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but since
here Congress gave permission to the Statej to remove this
obstacle? the Coyle problem would seem to disappear,,
But my suggestion was? Mr. Justice Rehnquist? that
but for Congress5 recognition that Washington like seven other
states have an impediment in its corisituti.on because it had
consulted with the State officials in Washington — and we
have Congressman Westland's word for it in the Congressional
Committee that Washington wants to come in on jurisdiction? the
Indians had be^en consulted and two of the tribes had indicated
their objection.
What is more? the Department of the Interior indicated
that they would at least tentatively recommend exemption of
those two tribes and one of those two trites is the Yakima Tribe,

33

So that if Washington had been treated like Oregon,
the result would have been that Washington would have been
fully covered, except only for the Colville and Yakima Indians,
who like the Warm Spring Indians in Oregon would have been
exempted and this problem would never have arisen»
Wow that .is how Congress treated every objecting
tribe with respect to whom the Department of Interior indicated
that they had a functioning lav/ and order system»
to believe the Yakima would not

No reason

have been similarly exempted.

So we begin there that it is a fluke, ms it were,
that the question even arises with respect to the Yakima.

What

is more, and this is conceded by the State of Washington, it
is clear that if anybody walked in on the Congressional hearings
on this matter in 1953, they would have come away with the
conviction that every member sitting thought Washington could
not take jurisdiction until and unless it had amended the
constitution.
And for that reason

and for that reason alone --

Congress wrote Section 6 of Public Law 280.
it write Section 6, it

And not only did

provided the proviso to Section 6 to

the effect that jurisdiction under this Act shall not take hold
until after the appropriate amendments have been made.
So the Congressional understanding was that Washington
would not now be free to assume jurisdiction, having failed
to take any action to amend its constitution.

34
QUESTION ?

Do you think in view of the language of

Section S that, even though a statutory amendment had required
— held been required under State law, that would nonetheless
have to have been by the people rather than by the legislature?
MR. CLAIBORNE?

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, had the

obstacle only been statutory, the legislative history is
ambiguous.

I think it is probably right to say that in that

event it would have been in view of those writing of Public
Law 280 a matter to be determined by State law.
QUESTION ?

And yet the language is exactly the same

in the law as written.
MR. CLAIBORNE?

But one must —• I suggest, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist — look at it in. this way?

The words "where necessary"

are introduced for one of two reasons we suggest? either to
r* imply identify those states with disclaimers, it meaning nothing
more than that, or as we suggest in our brief, it may mean
where there are only statutes, not constitutional provisions,
and in the view of the State court it is nevertheless necessary
to remove that obstacle by popular referendum.
It was so suggested by Committee counsel in the
hearings.

And that is, we suggest, the only reason why the

words "where necessary61 were introduced.
To read it otherwise is to make Section S wholly
surplusage.

And to read out the proviso which says such juris­

diction shall not obtain until and unless the appropriate

35

amendment has been made.
QUESTION;

Mr. Claiborne,, I am not 3ure that completely

answers Justice Rehnquist s question because both in the proviso
and in the introductory portion of 6, there is a reference of
the people amending the constitution or statute as the case
may be.

In both cases the word ‘"people" would seem to encompass

acts by the legislature.
Do you agree or disagree with that?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

I am not clear.

Mr. Justice Stevens, I think the

choice of the word "people" was because of the recognition that
a constitution, in the case of Washington as everywhere else,
has to be by popular referendum.
But that word does do double service.

It includes

the legislative amendment of the statutes,
QUESTION:

So you would agree that the word "people"

as used in both parts of Section 6 can refer to acts by the
legislature without a popular referendum?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Insofar as it addresses statutory

— only statutory impediments.

I think that is the best we

can do, Mr. Justice Stevens, in attempting to parse out what
was in the Congressional mind.
QUESTION:

I agree it is the bent you can do.

MR, CLAIBORNE:

Now certainly the question whether

Congress acted on its understanding, right, or wrong, that the
Washington constitution w«is an impediment that only popular

36
referendum could erase is a Federal question, if Congress acted
on that understanding and wrote Section 6 in the proviso thereto
with that understanding, that is binding even if as a matter
of State law the impediment could have been erased by legisla­
ture .
We think Congress did act on that understanding,
whether or not it was a misunderstanding and that, as a matter
of Federal law, the State must do what Congress thought to be
necessary in order to take jurisdiction*
1

QUESTION s

Do you think that after Congress acted

on that assumption Washington amended its constitution so an
to make amendments adoptable just by the legislature?
MR. CLAIBORNE3

Mr. Justice White, that is an

interesting in between situation which, fortunately, we do not
have to face,,
QUESTION?

Well, I do not know.

Since that time

the Supreme Court of Washington has interpreted its constitution
not to require a referendum.
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Had they amended their constitution

to so provide, we might have a closer question.

I would still

argue that the State was bound by the conditions imposed by
Congress.

It would have been perfectly clear if Congress had

said the Statas of Washington and the other seven shall not
assume this jurisdiction vmtil they have by popular referendum
amended the provisions

of their constitution which we rightly

or wrongly view as a bar to their taking jurisdiction.

37
No one would arcue in those circumstances that it
mattered what the State lew situation were,
QUESTIONs

If the language had been simply "by law",

there would be no problem, would there?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed.

And we say that construed

in the light of its legislative history that is what the court
is confronted with in Section 6.
Now we do go on to say that Congress was correct
in assuming that the obstacle in the State constitution, because
it derives from the enabling act, which was ■— and therefore
was written in the Congress for a Federal purpose, must as a
matter of Federal law be construed as not erasable by any means»
QUESTION:

But your contention that Congress was

correct in its understanding is not really a necessary pact of
your argument, is it?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
so.

Mr. Justice Stewe.rt, it is exactly

It is not a necessary part.
QUESTION:

Because your basic arc ument is whether

Congress was right or wrong about the necessity of providing
what it did, it did in fact so provide.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed, Mr, Justice Stewart.

One last word, if I may, the result which we suggest,
is rightly reached in this case.

It does conform with the

Congressional policy in i960 to compel the parties, thes tribe
and the State, to reach accommodations at arms length and,

38

therefore, to reduce the friction and the inefficiency of a law
enforcement system where the parties are at odds»
The parties should now return to the bargaining table
as free agents and work out an accommodation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, before you sit down, I

would like to ask you one further question on the jurisdictional
problem that Justice White identified.
Is it not correct that if we accept your theory, as
opposed to the theory of the Court of Appeals, that will
invalidate the assumption of jurisdiction with respect to the
nine tribes who consented to a full exception of the jurisdiction,
whereas the rationale of the Ninth Circuit did not?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, you are certainly

correct that our submission would ~ perhaps not in this case —
but the logic of our submission would invalidate those assump­
tions with respect to tribes between 1957 and 1963 for full
jurisdiction.
And it may be that that is not the consequence of the
Panel's decision, except only if one reads the '63 Act and the
857 Act as

part of a whole? and I suggested to Mr. Justice

White that that is how I read the opinion of the Panel.
QUESTION:

Well, the opinion of the Ninth Circuit

just dealt with the one section.
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

I think I stand corrected.

And how about, Mr. Claiborne, how about the

39

State jurisdiction over non-Indians, over whites?

What about

whites against Indians?
MR. CLAIBORNEs

Well there, I think, the Ninth Circuit

did hold that one could not pass it out,
QUESTION:

Well, they dealt with only one section.

That section dealt only wrth Indian defendants,
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Well, I had thought -— I may be wrong,

\

Mr, Justice White — that what the Ninth Circuit held was that
the 1963 Act is unconstitutional.

They perhaps left standing

the 857 Act, if one can read it as an independent legislation,
which of course historically it was.
QUESTION:

Well, it said we invalidate Section 37.12,010

tod 37.12.010 cited in its footnote — it just deals with
Indian defendants, does it not?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But if one looks at the jurisdictional

statement at page 35, Mr. Justice White, on the right-hand
column, can the invalidatcid portion of Section so forth be
separated from the remainder of the statute or does the whole
statute fall?
The Washington legislature could have severed these
provisions, but we cannot do so.
severability clause.

The statute contains no

We are unable to attribute to Washington

a willingness to include more jurisdiction than it undertook
partially to assume.

And I read that perhaps too hurriedly

as indicating that all of the 1.963 statute with its discrimination

40
between trust and non-trust land and its discrimination between
cases in the eight categories sshich are within State jurisdiction
even over trust land and even over Indian dependents, that that
whole complicated structure must fall.
QUESTION;

But that is just the 1963 Act.

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Justice Stevens, as I think I

indicated, I must withdrav? the answer I gave to Mr. Justice
White and agree that to that extent the results appear to be
different.
QUESTION;

Well then the question that raises •— and

I do not know the answer to the question that raises — does
that affect our jurisdiction to entertain this particular argu­
ment?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

The result may be, Mr, Justice Stevens,

that while the successful appellee can hardly be deprived of
his judgment when he had no

standing to bring the case here and

is therefore entitled to defend it on any Federal ground, perhaps
the judgment cannot go further than it would have gone — than
it was in his favor below.
he cannot go further.
QUESTION;

He merely defended the judgment and

I would make that submission.
In any event, it is nort of a housekeeping

rule, is it not?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Indeed, Mr*. Just.ice White.

And,

of course, this Court itself indicated its willingness ~
QUESTION;

And reaching statutory questions first is

41
also housekeeping.
MR, CLAIBORNE;

And it is the reason, of course, without

any disparaging the other argument that we put the statutory
questions first and foremost.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Hovis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. HOVIS, ESQ.
ON BEHAI,F OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HOVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it pleases

the court:
If I could just take a moment to respond to the last
question, this 37.12.010 has only to do with Indians and, as
Justice White

has pointed out, right in the first part it says

"assumes jurisdiction over Indians only and it does not assume
any jurisdiction over non-Indians by the 37 12.010."
The State's assumption of jurisdiction over nonIndians within the Reservation fall from the McBratney and the
Draper exception.
QUESTION:

Well when did Washington — under what

statute did Washington rather than the United States have
jurisdiction over non-Indians committing crimes on an Indian
reservation?
MR. HOVIS:

non-Indian against non-Indian

The fact is a rather confusing one for all of us to deal

with because ■—
QUESTION;
in this

Well, does the old '53 Act that is involved

case deal with non-Indian tribes — non-Indian defendants

or just Indian defendants?
MR. HOVIS;

It just deals with oases in which Indians

are involved.
QUESTION:

And what Act, if any, deals with crimes

by non-Indians on Indian reservations or is there such a
Washington Act?
MR. HOVIS:

There is no such Washington Act.

And

I am just going from the plain reading of the statute 37.12.010.
The State has interpreted different prosecutor by prosecutor
in different areas.

It depends on who does not want to do the

job when the complainant comes to the particular prosecutor.
But I direct your attention to the plain reading of
the Act as to whether it effects Indians or non-Indians.
In the Treaty in 1855 the Yakima Nation was reserved

43
explicitly and implicitly the right to control its internal
affairs by its

own laws and by its own government.

And for

a good number of years the Yakima Nation exercised that right
with responsibility.
At the time in 1953 they were exercising that right
of control within the exterior boundaries of their Reservation
with responsibility and Congress, because of other areas of the
country which were not
Public Law 280.

exercising their responsibility, passed

This Act provided directly for state juris­

diction in five listed stcites and provided for assumption by
statute in ten other states, and in Washington and seven other
states provided for assumption of state jurisdiction by the
amendment of the State constitution.
In 1955 in the first legislative session after that
Act, the proponents of State jurisdiction over Indians tried
to get a constitutional amendment through their legislature.
They did not amend their constitution.
In 1957 they provided by legislative act that the
tribes who wished jurisdiction could petition for jurisdiction.
Ten did and others did not.
It is interesting to note, however, that even the
tribes who have given it a fair trial and who wished jurisdiction
because of their experience they have had for the lack of
adequate protection are petitioning this court in the amicus
brief to be removed from State jurisdiction in the State of
Washington.

44
We came to 1963 and unilaterally and without amendment
of their State constitution the State of Washington passed 37»
12.010»

And this Act allowed the State to assume full jurisdiction

over non-trust lands and assumed partial jurisdiction over trust
lands for eight non-specified or non-defined or non-referred
categories.
The rest of the jurisdiction over Indians and Indian
matters remained with the tribe and with the Federal government.
And so we had about four different systems underneath this
Act for law enforcement officers to become familiar with.
Now the result of this unilateral action by the —
on the part of the State of Washington, contrary to the Treaty
promise to the Yakimas , has been law without order on the
Yakima Reservation.

The record is clear :.n this case that the

system is not adequate to handle the problem.
The State has admitted that the;.r system is not
adequate in two reports and to which we have referred to.
it is particularly

And

and our biggest problem -- it is par­

ticularly discriminatory snd causing a lot: of problems as regards
our Indian youth.
The problem is that the State and County have neither
the inclination or ability to provide law and order that they
so unilaterally assumed over our objection.

Mr. Gorton had

his map here and ha pointed out the vast area of the Yakima
Reservation* over 2*000 square miles.

Ancl there is deeded and

45
non-trust land sprinkled throughout even in the closed area,
but if you will notice from the record that in 1971, which was
the last available figures at the time this case was heard in
1972, the State made two felony arrests outside of the cities
and towns, out in this vast area, and 17 misdemeanor arrests»
Unfortunately, gentlemen, the Reservation law and
order system under Washington system does not either meet any
national standards? it does not meet any parity state-wide
standards.

Sure, we have as good law and order as they do in

some other bad parts.

It has no parity wr.th cities, and it

has no parity, if you please, with the — with other parts of
the County,
You notice that, while they are talking about 40
deputies assigned to the County, at the time of the trial there
were 29 and, even though the whole area oi: the County is only
4,700 square miles, only two were principally assigned to the
Reservation, which is over half that area, and only seven were
assigned to the entire lower valley which has a bigger population
than the rest of the rural areas.
Now what has happened here has teen a decline of
arrests of over 2,000 percent above and beyond the time when
the Indians — when the Federal government was handling the
responsibility and the juvenile situation is a scandal and that
is our biggest, problem.
Washington in its reports agrees to the lack of

46

that adequacy as you see in the record.

\nd the County officials,

particularly in the testimony,particularly agreed that it was
discriminatory, that there was more factors available for nonIndian youth than there was for Indian youth.
Now if there is going to be law and order on the
Yakima Reservation, we must regain our law and order and we
are here today to see ivhether underneath che law it is ours.
The Yakimas throughout all of this time, and are
today, have been vary responsible on this , in spite of the
unwarranted intrusions into their jurisdiction, they are
spending per capita for each and every mexaber more for law and
order than any other community in the United States, even though
they have not got the total responsibility.
Washington, as I said, in contrast refuses to meet
any reasonable standards.

Now as I understand my duty to this

Court, and it is first my duty to indicate» to this Court why
I believe that 37.12.010 should not pertaix* to the Yakima
Indian Nation before I get into the constitutional grounds.
Now I think that can be easily demonstrated, gentlemen.
It is undisputed by all the parties here that the treaty with
the Yakimas explicitly and implicitly reserve the Yakima
powers over their internal affairs to be governed by their own
laws and by their own government.
QUESTION %

Just one question — kind of a broad

question, I guess — but you emphasised there were only two

47
felony arrests by the State.

In the felony area, is it not

true that the replacement was the State instead of the Federal
authorities, because there was no

tribal jurisdiction anyway.

it was, felony arrests.

I have trouble with this.

Why is it

any more confusing now than it was before when it was the

MR. HOVISs

That is what puzzles me.

Now generally, practically among lav;

enforcement officers, they tend to respect each other's jurisdiction.

For example, the FBI would not any more be going

into a matter — getting away from the Indian situation, would
no more go into a State and start investigating a crime until
they were requested by another department.

That is just one

of the ways that it works.
Departments respect other department's jurisdiction.
So they give the other department the first crack at it.

That

That is the reason.

Then we have got. the tract system.

No one can tell

on the Reservation whether it is deeded property or trust
property.

These tracts are all interspaced and non-Indians

live on the Indian lands or trust lands, and Indians live on
deeded lands.
No one knows just exactly what the title of the land

Now that is the next problem.

MR. HOVISs

The District Court's opinion.
— District Court's opinion.

Nov; with all of the problems we have, having these
treaty powers and having them taken away, does this Public Law
280 affect the Yakima Tribe?

And we think it does not.

That

is the first problem that we think the way the Court handle
this question.
Now we do not think that this law affects the Yakima
Nation.

And let me explain to you why not.

We have those

explicit and implicit powt^rs to govern out people in our own
way by our own government.
Now Washington has contended that Congress has the
power to -- the absolute power to abrogate these treaty powers
and these treaty provisions. We disagree.
Court has said that this

We think that this

power is not absolute;to abrogate

the treaty that Congress must act in a constitutional manner,
number one; and two, nmst specifically and explicitly abrogate

-QUESTION;

Why?

*

Number one, what do you do with

Lone WcIf against Hitchcock?
MR. HOVISs

Well, as I understood this Court's decision

in Weeks versus Delaware,they said that Lone Wolf versus Hitch­
cock has been ignored by this Court for some 50 years?, and it

54
was about time that this Court said so»
QUESTION:

Well, it was cited in DeCoteau in a case

as recently as two years ago.
MR. KOVISi

I suggest that this ■— I was hopeful in

the reading of Weeks that this Court had determined that Congress
when it came to doing away with treaty provisions would have
to act in a constitutional manner and in that regard.

And that

is the way I interpreted the decision of this Court in Weeks
versus Delaware.
And also in Menominee# I understood this Court to
say that you must specifically and explicitly abrogate treaty
rights.

You cannot do it by implication.

And it must be done

clearly.
So it is clear in this case that. Congress knew neither
explicitly or implicitly abrogated these treaty rights# and it

xs also els r that# as the Solicitor G leral pointed out# that
Congress clearly intended to exclude th*, Vakimas because of the
hurried manner in which this Act was put together# and I suggest
that neither the Federal Act or the State Act is any specimen
of good legislation drafting# but in the hurried enactment of
that legislation# the Yakimas were not excluded.

If they had

of the named states# they would have been excluded.

Their law and order was satisfactory and it was recommended
to Congress that they be excluded.
Mow Washington has contended in this case that Washington

55
assumed

-jurisdiction over the Yakimas in any way or manner

that Washington in its sole judgment determines.

They were

saying that it was up to the State to determine whether they
could ignore the mandatory provisions of their constitution.
And I want to point out to the Court that that is
what they have done.

They have ignored --- they did not even

amend Article XXVI of their constitution even by a legislative
act.

It still sits there.

Whatever amendment to Article

XXVI there is, it is by implication only.
QUESTION;

Well, of course, that question has been

decided for us, has it not, by the Supreme Court of Washington.
And even we, sitting on the side lines, might think it is a
very wrong decision, it is none of our business and we have
nothing to do with it.
MR. HOVISs

Is not that correct?
I do not think that is true.

that is an issue here.

I think

First, I think it is an issue in

interpreting what Congress did.
QUESTION:
MR. HOVIS:

Well, that is a Federal question.
That is a Federal question.

In other

words, for the State of Washington to have different rules
in amending sections that apply to Indians and allowing it
to be done by implication, where you have another section that
applies to the rest of the populace or other problems, they
have to go through the mandatory amendment procedures.

For the

Supreme Court to come up with that kind of a decision, I think

is a lack of due process.
QUESTION:
MR. HOVIS:

Well, is that argument made here?
Yes, it is.

this case, if the Court please.

It has been made all through
And also I think it shows that

the Congress is right when they ask this Court — when they
ask the State of Washington to amend their constitution.
QUESTION:

If necessary.

That is a matter of State

law, is it not?
MR. HOVIS:

It is necessary as a matter of Federal

law and as a matter of constitutional law.
QUESTION:

Now whether or not it is necessary to

amend the Washington constitution in order for the Washington
legislature to do this, that or the other thing, is not that
wholly a matter of State law?
MR. HOVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. HOVIS:

Whether the State —
Matter of State constitutional law.
It is a matter of State constitutional

law, but the State no matter has to follow the constitutional
provisions of the United States and they must things in a due
process and with equal protection way.
QUESTION:
MR. HOVIS:

Withoist question.
Yes, whether it is the constitution or

whether it is the statute.

And they have not done that.

They

have not accorded this due process in the amendment of the
constitution.

If that is due process, thr.t is something I did

not —
QUESTION;

Can Congress tell ths State of Washington

how it may and may not amend its constitution?
MR. HOVISs

Congress cannot tell them how they may

amend their constitution, but this is the power that was
solely with the United States of America, the relationship
between the Indians and the jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

I know what you are driving at.

Can

Congress say that if Indians are involved. a state cannot
amend its constitution by the legislature'*
MR. HOVIS:

Congress can say we are delegating this

Federal power to you over Indians, but before you can accept
this Federal power over Indians, you must amend your con­
stitution in the way that we say you must amend it.
And it is clear in this case that Congress —
QUESTION;
MR. HOVISs

That it is different from my question?
It is different.

Congress cannot tell the State how to amend its
constitution, but if they are going to delegate the powers
to the State, like in this case, they can tell them what to
do.

And they did.

people.

They told them they had to do it by the

And that is what they have done.
I really question in this case that the matter is up

whether Congress could make such an unfettered delegation
anyway.

These legislative and judicial powers that are

53
definitely Federal are vented with the Federal government and
not with the State government.

And such a loose delegation,

as counsel would argue, that it was said to the State to do
it any way that you want to or any way that your laws permit
is not what I think Congress did nor something that I think
Congress can do.
I think to delegate this exclusive Federal power
in such an unfettered manner is not within Congress5 powers.
Finally, we reach the question of the Circuit Court
decision of this being uncjqual protection underneath the laws
of not providing protection based on the title of the land.
And the Circuit Court said that that provision was not equal
protection and, therefore, that portion of the section under
1963 would be stricken as unconstitutional.
Now I think the court was very clear on that.

They

did not go into whether there would be strict scrutiny or not.
They said there was no rational basis.
I want to point out to the Court, however, that the
rational basis that the State has come wi ;h here at this very
late date is the very — is new, never been brought into this
case before, and is inconsistent from their present position,
and inconsistent with their position before this Court in
Docket- 78-119,

In that case in the fishing matter, the

Supreme Court of the State of Washington :.s saying that in
regards to Indians and non-Indians -- in regards to the treaty

59

rights that there can be no differentiation or it is a violation
of equal protection of both State and Federal constitution.

So

the State is trying to have it this way in this case and the
other way in the other case.

And it is certainly a new

rationale that they came up with.
I would like to have the Court consider also in
matter that strict scrutiny should apply.

this

It is true that this

is not a racial situation, but certainly ny clients are discreet
and a minority, and certainly the rights involved -- the rights
to protection of person and property are most fundamental.
And if

necessary, I would like to have the Court

give that consideration.

I do not think that even this new

fancied rationale that the State comes up with at this late
stage, which is inconsistent from any position that they have
ever taken, that the Court will be necessary r.o reacn that
question„
There is no question that the clearest and easiest
way to reach this question is on the constitutional disclaimer
problem.

I certainly think that that is most clear.
Thank you very much for your tine,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

General Gorton, did you

have something further.
REBUTTAL OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, GORTON;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

60

please the courts
Mr. Justice White, you were inadvertently, I am
certain, totally 100 percemt misled by the answers of both
Mr. Claiborne and Mr. Hovis to your question on the scope of
RCW 37.12.010.
That statute — under that statute the State of
Washington obligates and Linds itself to assume criminal and
civil jurisdiction over Indians and Indian territory, reserva­
tions, counties, lands, the whole works.

It is of course from

that statute that we derive our jurisdiction to try a nonIndian for assaulting an Indian, which we did not have under
U. S. v McBratney. Precisely every prosecuting attorney in the
State knows that.
QUESTION:

Well, your opponent suggests that

Washington has never assumed jurisdiction over crimes by nonwhites .
MR. GORTON:

That is simply nonsense.

My co-counsel

here is the prosecuting attorney of Yakima County.

He literally

does that every week.
In any event, that source of jurisdiction is — as
a matter of fact, it is because of that reading of 37.12.010
that I indicated to you what I did.
QUESTION:

I picked this up from your brief.

You

indicate that if you do not prevail here, uhe State's jurisdiction
over whites, over non-Indians will be invalidated and that the

61
Federal government will assume that.
MR. GORTON:

Absolutely* except for the McBratney

exception.
QUESTION:
the other side?

But that would not expand the relief to

That was covered by the Ninth Circuit?

MR. GORTON:

Th«i Ninth Circuit does that totally

and without condition.

The Ninth Circuit may not have invalidated

the 1957 Act* but the 1957 Act is not applicable to the
Yakimas.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Gorton* you said except something.
Except for the McBratney exception.
Yes* a non-Indian against a non-Indian?
Exactly.

In any event* that statute

is what gives to Indians and non-Indians on both fee lands
and non-fee lands* on trust lands* exactly the same measure
of protection.

They have total protection on fee lands3 both

the Indians and the non-Indians have protection on trust
lands against everyone except for a member of the Yakima Tribe,
The Indian and non-Indian are in exactly the same situation.
QUESTION:

What about Indians committing crimes on

fee lands within the reservation?
MR. GORTON:

On fee lands within the reservations

are totally subject to State jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

And so there is a difference as to who

prosecutes misdemeanors?

It depends where they were committed.

62
MR» GORTON;

Yes, it does»

Now I did not answer your first question to me on
my Direct as well as I should have.

Actually, that police

confusion is practically ron-existent because the tribal code
is practically identical in all of its definitions to the State
Criminal Code.

That is simply a practical matter, however.

The other matter which really amounted to retrying
this case, which Mr. Hovis stated here even though he did not
prevail in the trial court, has to do with this outrageous use
of arrest figures.
Mr. Justice Stevens really answered that question.
What has happened, Mr. Justice Stevens, is that those arrests
now are being made by the tribal police under their deputization
from the County Sheriff.
arrested.

The same number of people are being

They ©re not being arrested by the Deputy Sheriff

because the tribe

keeps us off of two-thirds — you know, has

closed two-thirds of the reservation to entry by non-Indians.
QUESTION;

Well, if the tribal policeman is acting

as the County Deputy Sheriff, would not the arrest figures show
that the arrest was made by the Deputy Sheriff?
MR. GORTON;

No.

The arrest figures that were given

there were arrest figures by the County Sheriff.
QUESTION s
MR. GORTON;

Not by the Deputy?
Not by anyone else; not by the State

Patrol, which among other things had four times as many arrests

63

as the County Sheriff did., and which is also cross-deputized
by the tribal police.
Now back to the submission of the Solicitor General
in this matter.

The Solicitor General wishes that the phrase

"where necessary" were not in the statute.

And it would make

his case a great deal easier and mine a great deal more
difficult, but he says, well, maybe it just is a reference to
the fact that these are disclaimer states, or maybe it applies
only to statutes.
But, of course, it does not.

That phrase appears

right after the word "amend”

— "to amend where necessary

its constitution or statute."

And what it; means is quite

obvious.

It means that the State determines under State law

whether it is necessary to amend the constitution or a statute.
If it is not necessary under State law, the State is a Section
/

7 rather than a Section 6 State.
Congress was not interested in building up extra
fences, making additional federal requirements which did not
pre-exist.

I simply wish to go back to the point which 1 made.

A great deal of the Solicitor General's brief has to do with
the fact that this requirement of a vote by the people was made
way back in 1889, but when in 1889 South Dakota said, no, sir,
it is not by the people, the President of the United States
accepted that as total compliance with the same enabling act.
South Dakota, Washington, Montana were admitted

64
pursuant to the same enabling act.

That debate actually was

all over South Dakota ■— Dakota and its division into two
separate states? 40 states in the country -— 35 states rather
very clearly have neither enabling acts nor were required to
take jurisdiction on a mandatory basis.
Yet they were given the choice to determine under
state law what jurisdiction they wished to take.
with this entire arguments

The problem

We would not be here before you at

all because of the fact that you have already decided the
enabling act question, except for the fact that we were more
considerate of the tribal desire for self-government than was
any other state that dealt with Public Law 280.
Their argument is you could not give the tribes that
option.

That is what it amounts to. 'We took full jurisdiction,

Mr. Justice White.

We exercised full jurisdiction over every­

thing that was covered by the enabling act; even when the
enabling act was in full effect.

Fee lanes, as I said earlier

and in an argument that was not answered here, fee lands are
not covered by the enabling act at all, ar.d over them we took
full jurisdiction. On those, lands in which the Indians have
the greatest interest the ones which they own or which are
held in trust for them we deferred to their, — to the Tribe,
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Except in eight categories?
Except in eight categories.

We agreed to take full jurisdiction.

That is what

65

we are required to do.

But that statute, Section 7, also says

"at such time as the State legislature may determine."

That

time is when the Yakima Tribe agrees.
We gave them the choice, a generous choice, and we
should not be penalized for it.
