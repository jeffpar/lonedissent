PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in United States against Addonisio, No. 78-156.
Mr. Easfcerbrook, I think you may proceed whenever
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case involves questions about the allocation
of authority to determine how long a convicted prisoner
remains in jail.
It presents the question whether a district court
can reduce a lax^ful sentence if a judge determines that a
decision by parole authorities frustrated the judge’s expec­
tations about when the prisoner would be released.
Mv argument has a number of strands, and my presentation may be clearer if I tell you now where I intend to go
durina the argument.
After stating the case, I will argue three propo­
sitions:

first, there has not been any dramatic change in

the practice of the parole authorities since respondents
were sentenced; consequently, no one’s expectations should
have been frustrated.
My second proposition is that any subjective
expectations of the judge that were frustrated in fact were

4
not legitimate expectations, because courts never had a right
to insist, or even expect, that the parole commission would
exercise its discretion in any particular way, so that release
would take place at a particular time „
The third proposition is that even if judges have
some legitimate expectations about the date of release,
thev are not entitled to insist that the parole commission
conform its behavior to those expectations.
QUESTION:

And part of your third point:

Even if

they had some legitimate expectations, and even if those _
aRd even

there has been a change of policy of the Parole

Board, nonetheless.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

My point then is that there is

no collateral remedy for that sort of thing, that there's no QUESTION:

Inother words, even if you're mistaken

on the first two points, nonetheless?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Nonetheless; that's the sense of

what I intend to present.
QUESTION:

Where does the phrase,

expectation,'1 come from, Mr. Easterbrook?

"legitimate

MR. EASTERBROOK:

QUESTION.

fou, mean judges have property rights and

.Liberty rights under Roth?

5
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I don't want to argue that judges

have liberty or property rights under Roth,

They're not

vindicatina their own rights.
Although there's a strong undercurrent in the Third
Circuit's opinion in this case, that this case's all about the
rights of judges; that this is about the right of judges to
insist on the release at a particular time; that it frustrates
the legitimate expectations to do anything else.
And in that sense, arguments about legitimate
expectations and the like responds to what the Third Circuit
was talking about.
But I'd like to begin with a short statement of the
facts.
Addonizio was the Mayor of Newark between 1962 and
1970.

In 1970, he was convicted of 63 counts of extortion;

essentially, of conspiring with members of organized, crime
to sell for money his performance of governmental services.
The maximum sentence on these convictions exceeded
1,000 years in jail.

Judge Barlow said that Addonizio had

committed, and I quote, "crimes of monumental proportion, the
enormity of which can scarcely be exaggerated."
And he said, these were no ordinary -QUESTION:

What was your time frame in which he

expressed that view?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

This was in 1970, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

That's when he imposed the sentence?

MR. EASTERBRQOK:
convicted.

Yes, when Mayor Addonizio was

lie said these were no ordinary criminal acts, but

instead were — and I againquote from page 10 of the Appendix ’brazen, callous and contemptuous of the law."
The judge then sentence Addonizio to 10 years in jail
and said not one word about his expectations of release on
parole.
The Parole Commission essentially took the judge at
his word, and concluded that Addonizio was not an ordinary
criminal.

The Commission decided that because of the magni­

tude and nature of the crimes, Addonizio should serve approxi­
mately srx years of the 10 year sentence in this case, at the
end of which he would be released mandatorily on good time
credits„
Judge Barlow responded to this decision by reducing
the sentence from 10 years to 5, stating that the Commission's
decision had frustrated his expectations that Addonizio would
be released after 3 or 4 years.
Because the Commission had decided to hold Addonizio
longer, Judge Barlow said it was necessary to reduce his
sentence to achieve earlier release„

Whelan and Flaherty are much the same.

They were sentenced to 15 years in prison»

And they

sought reduction of their sentences when it appeared that the
Parole Commission would hold them for a little more than 7
years before their release.
Judge Biunho denied relief, finding release would
frustrate the sentencing intentions of Judge Shaw, who
imposed the sentence,

■f

But the
;

Third Circuit affirmed* in Addonizio's
}•

case and reversed in Whelan’s and Flaherty's.

And it gave

two principal reasons for holding that district judges have
authority to reduce their sentences in response to parole
decisions.
First it said because judges have almost unlimited
authority to set a maximum terra of imprisonment it just
follow that the judge's expectations about the actual time
to be served should be vindicated to the fullest possible
extent.
The change in the Commission's approach to release
decisions had thwarted the judge's ability to achieve release
at a particular time, the Third Circuit reasoned.

And so the

only way that judges could vindicate their expectations, and
achieve release,, was to shorten sentences.
And the second argument that the court

gave was

8

that traditional standards of criminal justice reject imposition
of double punishment.

They found double punishment here

because both the district judge and the Parole Commission had
taken the nature of the offensa and its severity into account
in making their decisions.
Underlying much of the Court of Appeals8 reasoning,
and all of the arguments of respondents, is the contention
that in 1973 the parole officials radically changed their
approach to making decisions.
Until 1973, they thought, well behaved prisoners
could expect to be released after serving approximately onethird of their sentences.
After November, 1973, this was no longer true, they
argued.

Judges had imposed sentences, they thought, in the

expectation that there would be release after one-third, so
that they could achieve an easily predictable date of release
simply by sentencing defendants to three times as much as
they really wanted them to serve.
And then when the Commission rudely surprised
everyone by changing its policy, requiring some people to
serve more than a third, the argument runs, judges were
entitled to revise their sentences to bring the actual time to
be served back in line with what they had in mind to begin
wi th.
The same argument, I assume, would apply whenever
the Parole Commission changes its policies or its guidelines,

9

a practice that now occurs every six months to every year, as a
result of hearings, and continuing oversight of parole prac­
tices .
But this argument really doesn't hang together.

It

fails at a number of points.
It assumes, first, that there was a radical change
in policy.

There was not.
Ac assumes that judges were entitled to set sentences

in a

waV

that achieves definite release dates.

They were not.

And it assumes that there's a statutory source of
authority to resentence a defendant if the original plan goes
awry; there is not.
But I will start with the argument that there has
been a radical change in parole criteria sometime between
1970 and thepresent.
The first place to start on that score, it seems to
me, is with the statute that allocates authority between
judges and the Commission.

The basic statutes allocating

authority are unchanged between 1970 and today.
The principal statutes prohibit judges from setting
a minimum term of imprisonment of more than one-third of the
maximum„

The consequence of this is that the Commission

retains substantial discretion between the one-third and the
mandatory release date on accumulated good-time credits.
Another statute, a statute dealing with probation

10

prohibits split sentences»
was very careful.

It's a statute in which Congress

When a term of imprisonment is combined

with a sentence of probation, the imprisonment component
\

cannot exceed six months.
The effect of this is that a judge cannot divide
up release supervision with imprisonment in a way that sets a
release date at any distance in the future,
There's another statute, 18 U.S.C. 4218(d), which
provides that release decisions are committed to agency
discretion by law, which effectively prohibits any judicial
review, even under the arbitrary and capricious standard, of
decisions to the Parole Commission about actual release date.
And there's one more rule which allocates authority.
This Court held in the Affronti and Murray cases that a judge
cannot reduce a sentence after service has commenced, even if
he discovers that the sentence was a mistake, which was the
case in Murray.
That rule has been changed by a Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 35, but only by giving the court authority
for 120 days.

And the 120 days marked the dividing line

between the authority of courts and the authority of the
Commission under the statutes.
And all of those have remained constant throughout
this litigation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, may a judge say . the

11

sentence is going to be from three to seven, and I want him to
remain confined for at least four?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

A judge could —

Could he to that extent impinge upon the

authority of the parole —
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, he could not say three

to seven, because three is more than one-third of seven.
He could say two to seven, for example.

And he could say

that he wants the Commission to release him at the end of four
years.
QUESTION:

What standing does that advisory utterance

have?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Commission is now required by

statute to consider what the judge says in that respect.
There's an explicit statute providing that judges can give the
Commission recommendations, £md requiring the Commission to
consider them.
In that sense —

Well, what I'm trying to get at is, can

the judges' desires and expectations.
t

i

QUESTION:
MR.

Okay.

EASTERBROOK:

One of the ironies of this case is

that if you credit the Third Circuit view that the Commission
cannot consider the nature and seriousness of the offense,
the Parole Commission would presumably be prohibited from
releasing someone early in his sentence on the ground that the
crime is trivial and that the defendant didn't deserve to stay
in jail.
Because that entire field is prohibited by the Third
Circuit's decision.

It cuts both ways.

In any even, the Commission in 1970 —■ the time of
the sentences here — faced substantial pressure for change.
It was under criticism from the administrative conference;
from respected scholars such as Professor Davis and some others,
who contended that it was making arbitrary decisions without
published standards and so on.
And there was substantial desire on the Commission's
part, and on the part of the academic and administrative law
community, that the Commission do something else.
What it did was to cooperate with the National
Counsel on Crime and Delinquency to study its own procedures.
Persons sat in at hearings that were being conducted by the

13
Commission and tried to figure out what the Commission was
doing in fact.
The study found that the Commission's decisions
could be explained most adequately if you knew three kinds of
things:

If you knew the nature and seriousness of the offense;

if you knew his release prospects, that is, how likely he was
to commit new crimes if released; and if you knew something
about his prison behavior.
And of those two, the nature and seriousness of the
offense, and his release prospects, were the most important.
These findings became the basis for the system of
guidelines which the Commission adopted in 1973, which allows
you to look up in a table some range of dates, for example,
26 to 35 months, within which approximately 30 percent of the
people of a particular offense's seriousness and a particular
release prognosis could expect to serve.
What the Commission was trying to do there was to
regularize its decisions to prevent what had been perceived as
arbitrary, erratic and unexplained decisions, and in no small
measure, to control its own hearing examiners, because parole
policy is

supposed to bemade by the Commissioners rather than

by the hearing examiners, and if the Commission didn't have
published criteria, how could the hearing examiners know what
to do.
What happened in 1973 -- at least what the Commission

14

contended happened in 1973 -— was that the release criteria
that had been used all along become visible and routine, rather
than invisible and erratic.
And there’s substantial confirmation for the Commis­
sion's view of what it was doing.

No one should have thought in

1970 that there was presumptive release after one-third of
the sentence„
The statute, in effect, in 1970, which we have quoted
at note 14 on page 27 of our brief, said that the Commission
acquired discretion to release someone only if it found two
things first:

One was that rehabilitation or -- it was a

rehabilitation and welfare criteria, essentially.
And the second dealt with the welfare of society.
The latter, we think, included considerations of general
deterrence, just desserts, and so on; or at least the Commis­
sion so interpreted them.
But even if a prisoner could show that he was
rehabilitated, and that release was not incompatible with the
welfare of society, what the statute then provided was, quote,
the commission may in its discretion elect to grant parole.
In other words, it had absolutely unbridled
discretion. Nothing in the statute could have supported an
inference or a belief that there was an entitlement to release
after one-third of the sentence.
The Commission, during the period at issue here,

15
repeatedly said that it took offense severity into account.
That's diseased at pages 51 to 53 of our brief, where we
!

i

reproduce some of the statements by the Chairman of the
Commission and others of the Commissioners.
If anyone had a contrary expectation about what the
Commission was doing, it was invented; it wasn’t derived from
what the Commission said,
QUESTION:

Well, Mr, Easterbrook, we were advised

some years ago by a public official to pay attention to what
we do and not to what wa say.
MR, EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Precisely,

And —

MR, EASTERBROOK:

The Commission’s deeds comported

with its words, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s what I was going to ask you.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

In the 1970 Parole Commission

biennial report, which collects figures from 1966 to 1970, the
report of the release decisions over that period, table 10
of the report, which apnears at page 20, describes release
decisions,
And according to the table, of all adult prisoners,
only 45.5 percent were ever released on parole; that is more
than half of all adult prisoners were held until mandatory
expiration.
Those figuras speak, I think, quite loudly about the

15

absence of any presumption of release at the one-third point.
We've also collected, at page 47 — excuse, at note
47 of our brief, some data that were assembled by the
Commission on Crime and Delinquency, the same commission that
conducted the study that led to the guidelines.
And those data show that almost ■— if you can find
the sample of the first offenders who were sentenced to more
than a year, approximately 30 percent of that group was
continued to expiration of sentence, in 1970, that particular
year, the year of the sentencing of Mr. Addonizio.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, was it not true at that

time that there were a number of narcotic offenders i^ho were
ineligible for parole?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

It’s true.

How much of that — how much do they

account for?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The data in this brief contain

only people who were eligible for release on parole; that's
my understanding,
That's one reason why — not only were they excluded,
but it was also necessary to set — to select a class of
prisoners who were serving more than a year; because under
statute, prisoners sentenced to a year or less were not
eligible for parole.

They're just held to release on good time.

17
QUESTION:

Have you got any figures for first

offenders?
MR» EASTERBROOK:

Yes, the first offenders are in the

first paragraph of the note on page 47.

The Parole Commission's

published table —
QUESTION:

That is, note 47 on page 55?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Note 47 on page 55 in our brief;

the first paragraph does try to break down the first offenders,
distinguishes first offenders from all offenders.
The Parole Commission data, which is at page 20,
table 10, of the biennial report for the years in question,
does not break it down that way.

You can't get a breakdown

on first offenders fromthat table.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easfcerbrook, on that footnote 47,

how precise is this one-third?

It says a certain percentage

up to one-third, and some 61 parcent sometime after one-third.
How — in other words, two weeks after a third, or three
weeks, or how much?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

No -- in fact, it was pointed out

that we hadn't been sufficiently precise by respondent
Addonisio.
The data apparently deal with releases within
two months of the one-third point.

If you are released within

two months of one-third, you treated as being released at
one-third.

Releases more than two months after one-third are

18

being treated as after one-third.
QUESTION s

I see.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

The reason for the two month gap

is because many people didn't have their hearings until very
close to the one-third point, and couldn’t be released —
QUESTION:

Well, in fact, it didn't happen until

after they passed the one-third point? isn't that right?
Don't regulations provide that there’s no hearing until the
one-third, and you have the hearing, and then in the time it
takes to do the paperwork, a lot of people —•
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That — yes, Your Honor, that was

the reason for the allowance of the two months.
QUESTION:

And is two months enough to take care of

everybody who is successful at his first —
MR. EASTERBROOK:
is.

The Parole Commission believes it

I must say I haven't e xaminad the data
QUESTION:

myself.

But it is —- it is correct, is it not,

there was a mandatory parole hearing under the regulations
then in effect then after one-third?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Yes, there was.

And —

MR. EASTERBROOK:

It — with the exception of persons

sentenced under what's now the (d)(2) sentence —
QUESTION:

Right.

1Ro EASTERBROOK:

— that is, persons who were

QUESTIONS
out.

And they were even later, the way it worked

They got a meaningless hearing early, and a significant

one later, is the way it worked.

At least the Seventh

Circuit —
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Some people, as the data show, got

released at the allegedly meaningless first hearing.

They

were released almost right away.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

In many events, because the Commis­

sion thought the crime was trivial.

And there was a policy of

letting them out.
But —
QUESTION:

But in any event, there was --

putting

those to one side, there was a regulation which mandated a
hearing after one-third of the sentence had been served?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

There was.

And is it not true that a significant

number of people were released at that hearing?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
about that.

Oh yes; oh yes... There's no doubt

It comes tolerably close to 40 percent or 50

percent of all prisoners who had a hearing got released right
then.

And that is -—
QUESTION:

And I just wonder, is it your position

that the judge could not reasonably anticipate that a

20

defendant who had good institutional behavior would very
likely be released at the end of approximately a third of hi.s
sentence?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

I think in 1970 a judge could

reasonably have anticipated that a substantial portion of all
prisoners with good institutional behavior would be released
in that time.
The question is whether he could have reasonably
expected that the substantial proportion was not simply 50
percent or 60 percent or the like; hopefully, including
persons like Mr. Addonizio.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

But even in 1970 there was —- if

you can visualise a bell-shaped curve —- there's a -- really a
tail^off toward the more serious end.
Somebody has to fit in that tail, even in 1970.

And

the Commission had a habit then, and it still does, of filling
that group with persons like Mr. Addonizio whose crimes are
really quite severe, or are perceived as quite severe, by the
Commission's qualified judgment.
QUESTION;
6

Mr. Easterbrook, if the government prevails

here, does Addonizio have to —
MR. EASTERBROOK;

If the government prevails here,

Mr. Justice Brennan, his original 10-year sentence willbe
restored.

And the Commission's practice has been in cases of

21

this sort — and it has informed me that it will follow the
practice

—■ of giving the prisoner another hearing before

his return to orison.
In many of the cases —
QUESTION:

Well, what — didn’t Judge Barlow actually

reduce the sentence to time served?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

He did, and he had served five years

and two months.
QUESTION:

And you challenged --

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

We challenged —

— his power to reduce it?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor.

So that if we

prevail here. Judge Barlow's order will be set aside> and the
sentence restored to 10 years.
The Commis sion —
QUESTION:

How long has he been out now?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

He5s been out for a little more

than two years now.
And in light of that •—
QUESTION:

Didn't I release him at one time?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, Judge Barlow released

him, the Third Circuit ordered him to return to jail, and the
Supreme Court, by a vote of 7-2, released him.
But before the Commission would order him to serve
any additional portion of his sentence, it would hold an
additional hearing to take into account what's happened in

22
the two years he's been released.

And my understanding of

other cases in which district judges have ordered persons to
be released, and the Commission has then prevailed on appeal —
in the First, the Eighth and several of the other circuits
that have this kind of litigation going on — is that a
substantial number of persons are now returned to prison or
are continued on parole„
That judgment will ba for the Commission to make in
all three cases here.
But even I'm wrong on all of this, and if you grant
that there was a change in policy, I think it clear fromthe
network of statutes and rules that we've been discussing that
Congress gave the Commission the power to establish the parole
policy and its exercise of the parole policy, its change of
the parole policy, is not something that can lead to resen­
tencing „
When a prisoner is sentenced, he's subjected to the
Commission's discretion.

That's exactly the meaning of the

sentence that gives the Commission authority between the onethird point and the end of the sentence,
A particular use of that discretion is, we submit,
not a ground for complaint, even if ten years ago the Commis­
sion would have exercised its discretion in a different way,
A

judge can object to the consequences of that kind

of change only if he has some legitimate ability to control

23

the time of release.

But it’s exactly that ability to control

the time of release that Congress denied to judges.
The Third Circuit's general view, which is, that
because judges have absolute control over the maximum time to
be served, they must have control over the actual time to be
served, is a classic nonsequitar.

It's nothing but disagree­

ment with the statutory policy giving one branch of government
authority over the maximum and another branch of government
authority over the actual time fcobe served,
i

It's almost inevitable that that kind of process is
going to produce frustration.
legitimately so — that
after four years.

Judges may well believe — and

a particular prisoner should be released

Given the statutory framework, there is

no way he can hand down a sentence saying, "Hold this many for
four years and then release him,"
A judge must attempt to approximate. But his inability
to predict correctly the error in successive approximations is,
we submit, not anything that entitles a judge to claim the
very power that Congress withheld, the power to set a precise
release date.
My final argument is that I could be wrong in that
too, and respondents still aren't entitled to relief.

No

statute authorizes a court to review sentences in response to
the frustration of sentencing judges, even if the frustrations
and the judge's expectations were legitimate.

24

This Court's decision in Affront! and in Murray
established that courts cannot reduce sentences after their
service has commenced.

Rule 35 mitigates that only to the

extent of establishing a line of demarcation at 120 days
after the judgment, rather than at the beginning

the

sentence.
The Court of Appeals held that Section 2255 supplies
a residual source of authority to revise sentences.

This, we

think, is incorrect.
That very proposition was implicitly rejected in
Murray and Affronti.

But more than that, the Court of Appeals'

position overlooks the limits on the scope of collateral
review.
As this Court held in Davis, collateral review in
non-constitutional cases, or in cases of non-constitutional
defects, is available only when necessary to avoid a
miscarriage of justice.
But all that happened here was that respondents
lawfully sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment,
have been required to continue in service of those terms;
no matter how you look at it, v;e think, continued service of
lawful terms of imprisonment is not a miscarriage of justice.
Respondents here should be treated no differently
than other persons who are held in jail after the judge
believes they should be released.

There may be circumstances,

25

such as the religious conversion of a prisoner, that would
lead a judge to believe that his sentence had become wildly
inappropriate.
And yet it seems clear that the release discretion
at that point is entrusted to the Commission, or perhaps to the
President, rather than a continuing supervisory authority of
the courts.
We think that a court at that point cannot claim to
use Section 2255 to produce the result that is otherwise
forbidden.
And for all of these reasons, we submit, the judgment
of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Easterbrook, was there ever a claim

in this case chat the Commission's change in regulations
constituted an ex post facto law?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

There has never been such a claim

in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, did Judge Aldisert refer

to Affront! in his opinion at all?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

He did not, nor to Murray.

Was it urged on him at the Third Circuit

level?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I believe it was, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL EDELSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ADDONIZIO
MR8 EDELSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My brother Mr. Easterbrook gave you some background,
factual background, in the Addonizio case.

He told you about

the indictment? he added up the cumulative sentence which
might have been imposed.
To a certain extent, I think that that goes to the
heart of this case.

This was a 15 co-defendant, multi-count

co-conspiracy trial.

The trial judge sat through a very

lengthy trial.
After conviction, the trial judge set a sentence for
a particular purpose to achieve a particular end.

In his

opinion granting the Section 2255 motion, Judge Barlow
said, "Yes, indeed, I felt Mr. Addonizio was guilty of a very
severe offense."
QUESTION;

That’s putting it mildly, isn’t it, in

light of the excoriating statements he made at page 10?
MR. EDELSON:

Well, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice,

in that entire indictment, Mr. Addonizio was accused of
receiving $4,000.
QUESTION;

But I’m not — I’m concerned with what

the judge said about the nature of his offense —

27

MR. EDELSON:
QUESTION;

All right.

— which he committed by betrayal of

trust as the highest elected official of Newark.
MR. EDELSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

Judge Barlow also stated at page 9, in the Appendix, in
response to arguments made by trial counsel, Judge Barlow
stated, "An intricate conspiracy of this magnitude, I suggest
to you, Mr. Addonizio, could have never succeeded without
the then-Mayor1s approval and participation."
QUESTION;

And he was the then-Mayor.

MR. EDELSON:

He was the then-Mayor.

I suggest to Your Honor that the finding of
guilt with regard to Mr. Addonizio was the finding that he was
the Mayor, and that as the Mayor, he bore ultimate responsi­
bility in terms —
QUESTION;

Well, are you suggesting that this

record doesn't show that he was in it up to his eyes?
MR. EDELSON:

I am suggesting, if your Honor please,

that this record does not show that he was in it up to his
eyes.
QUESTION:

Than this was an outrageous statement on

the part of Judge Barlow to make.
MR. EDELSON:

Judge -— I understand that.

Judge Barlow found it to be extremely severe.
Honor said, that may be an understatement.

Yes, he —

And as Your

28

What Judge Barlow said is clearly set forth.

The

words are there.
What he intended, his evaluation of the severity of
the offense, and what he intended to be the punishment based
on his evaluation of the severity of the offense, he also has
said very clearly, and he has said that in his opinion
granting the motion, the Section 2255 motion,
QUESTION:

Than do you suggest that Judge Barlow was

not fully aware that the parole authority would ultimately
take into account what he would say in passing on possible
parole release?
MR. EBELSOM:

I would suggest to Your Honor that he

was -- in one sense -- he was not aware that the Parole
Board would re-evaluate the severity of the offense and take
into consideration his statements —
QUESTION:
It just shows

Well, they didnlt have to re-evaluate it.

very clearly in the record that they didn't

re-evaluate it, they just took Judge Barlow's svaliaation —
*•

■-

.?

.

.

they say at page 11, as the highest elected official of the
City of Newark, you were convicted of an extortion conspiracy
in which, under color of your official authority, you and
your co-conspirators conspired to delay, impede, obstruct and
otherwise thwart the construction — construction in the City
of Newark in order to obtain a percentage of contracts for the
privilege of working on city construction projects; and

29
because of the magnitude of this crime, the money being
$241,000, indicated, its effect on the city is very great; and
so forth.
Now, the Parole Board was doing what it should do,
namely, take into account the total record up to the time of
the imposition of the sentence, including everything in the
presentencing report; everything the sentencing judge said
either by way of mitigation or aggravation; isn't that
correct?
MR. EDELSON;

If Your Honor please, in reviewing the

pre-sentence report, and everything said by

way of mitigation

and aggravation, and the weight that they ultimately gave to
that review, I suggest to the Court that they were in fact
re-evaluating the severity of the offense.
QUESTION;

Well, I would read the Parole Board's

statement as much more moderate than Judge Barlow's statements;
not involving a re-evaluation at all.
MR. EDELSON;

Well, if Your Honor please, we do at

least know that Judge Barlow felt that the punishment which
fit the crime, in his evaluation of the severity, would
have been incarceration for 3-1/2 to 4 years; that is
perfectly clear from what Judge Barlow has said in his motion
granting the Section 2255, in his opinion granting the
Section 2255 motion.
QUESTION;

Mr. Edelson, with respect to 2255, did

30

Judge Barlow or the Third Circuit give any explanation for
why they thought this was a sentence subject to collateral
attack, in view of our holdings in Murray and Affronti?
MR. EDELSON:
and Affronti.

Well, neither court addressed Murray

But yes, they did give reasons why they felt

Section 2255 —
QUESTION:

I've read their opinions, and I'm amazed,

frankly,that they didn't even discuss Murray or Affronti.
They addressed other lower-court opinions.
MR. EDELSON:

Well, Murray and Affronti, if Your

Honor please, did both — if I'm correct — did both deal
with the interpretation of probation statutes.

And probation

is somewhat different from parole, and also in this case,
what both Judge Barlow and the Third Circuit found was that
there was in fact a radical change in the criteria which was
applied in parole decision-making after sentence, and before
parole eligibility, and that was the controlling fact.
QUESTION:

But did Murray and Af fronti suggest that

that was at all relevant?

Whether or not there had beena

radical change?
MR. EDELSON:
suggestion there.

Well, I would agree that there is the

But I also believe that the cases are in

fact distinguishable. I can't answer for the Third Circuit
or Judge Barlow as to why those issues were not addressed in
the

opinions.

31

If the Court please, when the sentence of 10 years
was set, at least what Judge Barlow says he was doing was some­
thing very specific»

He was trying to set, in accordance

with the statutes then in effect, and what was known by
sentencing judges, a time of incarceration.
Mr. Justice Brennan asked, could the judge set a
three to seven sentence, and say, "He may not be released until
four years?”
In 1970, in order for Judge Barlow to have guaranteed
that Mr. Addonizio stayed in prison, stayed incarcerated, for
the 3-1/2 to 4 years that he intended, he had to give him a
10-year sentence.

But he also had the expectation that when

he became eligible for parole under the statute, under

4202,

at the one-third point, his eligibility would then be
considered based upon his institutional record and the evalua­
tion of the probability of recidivism.
QUE-STIONs

But maybe Congress didn't want to give

Judge Barlow either the power to guarantee a minimum or to give
him any expectation as to a maximum.
MR. EDELSON:

Well, I think they did give — they

did give him the right to guarantee the minimum.
QUESTIONs

By fixing a higher maximum.

MR. EDELSONs
QUESTIONS

That's correct.

Yes.

MR. EDELSONs

Because the statute provides when —-

32

provided, and still provides — when there is a straight
sentence, then the inmate is not eligible for parole until he
has served one-third of his sentence.
QUESTION: But there's still nothing in the sentencing
statutes about giving the judge any expectation as to a
maximum.
MR. EDELSON:

Well, there is nothing — I would agree

that there is nothing in the statute.

There was a lot in

case law by 1970.
QUESTION:

In this Court?

MR„ EDELSON:
please.

Not in this Court, if Your Honor

I don't —■ although there were — there are comments,

general comments, on the philosophy of parole, which I assume
were shared by trial courts in their expectation of how the
parole system worked.
In the Third Circuit, for example, we had the case
of -QUESTION:

Of course what we have —

MR. EDELSON:

— of Berry v. United States.

Excuse

me, I just wanted to give you the citation.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. EDELSON:

Where the Court said that the

reasonable expectation is that the prisoner will serve onethird of the full sentence.
QUESTION:

Well, the fact that the Third Circuit's

33

opinions may have given Judge Barlow the district judge in
New Jersey, an expectation, certainly doesn't bind us in any
way, does it?
MR„ EDELSONs

If there was such an expectation, and

if sentences were imposed based on that expectation, it is
our contention that there was a crucial error in the imposi­
tion of sentence.
QUESTION?

Even though this Court had never sustained

the Third Circuit’s position?
MR, EDELSON?

Yes, even though this Court had never

sustained the Third Circuit’s opinion, because there was
nothing from this Court to say whether or not there? was an
expectation, other than this Court — there are — there are —
there is language in Morrissey v. Brewer, for example, which
is similar to language in many circuit court cases, that the
object of parole is to release the inmate as quickly as the
parole authorities have determined that he has shown rehabili­
tation and can be put back on the street without the fear of
recidivism, without —
QUESTION:

Isn't there another factor that's added

to that at every level, and that is, wehther in weighing —
looking at the seriousness and gravity of the crime, the
release at that time will discourage or depreciate the
administration of justice, and undermine the deterrent factor
of punishment?

34

MR, EDELSON:

If Your Honor please, that was very

specifically added in the 1976 Parole Commission Reorganization
Act, a comparison between 184203, and the present 184206(a),
which sets the criteria, shows that first of all, the old
criteria did not tell the Parole Commission, or Parole Board,
at that time, to look at the severity of the offense; and
4202 — I3m sorry, 420 — 420 — I was correct at first,
4203, said that if it appears to the Parole Board from a
report by the proper institutional officers, or upon appli­
cation by a prisoner eligible for release on parole, that there
is a reasonable probability that such person will live and
remain at liberty without violating the laws, and if in the
opinion of the Board such release is not incompatible with
the welfare of society, the Board may in its discretion
authorize the release of such prisoner on parole.
That, if Your Honor please, should be compared to
4206(a) today, which contains the additional language, if
an eligible prisoner has substantially observed the rules of
the institution or institutions to which he has been confined;
and if, the Commission, upon considering the nature and
circumstances of the offense and history, and characteristics
of the prisoner, determines that release will not depreciate
the seriousness of his offense, or promote disrespect for the
law,
Those words were not in the statute in 1970,

They

35
were —
QUESTION:

Do you suppose they were in the minds of

the people who were experienced in this activity, and judges
who were imposing sentences?
MR. EDELSON:
QUESTION:

I --

There's nothing new about those concepts?

You find them through the literature on the subject over the
last 30 or 40 years.
MR. EDELSON:

Judge, I believe that until the new

act, the punishmant-retribution-daterrence aspects were
covered generally by the sentence imposed.

Parole was not

viewed as having a primary, or even meaningful secondary,
purpose in serving those functions.
Parole started out as an ameliorative measure.

MR, EDELSON:

attended.

I have never

I have read some reports and synopses of things

that are said.
Of all the things that I have found published that
have taken place at those institutes, I would say that most of
the comments of the judges were concerned with their assumption
that in fact release was really almost automatically granted,
and our case does not depend on that.
Severity of the offense was mentioned.

But our

position here is that it was almost a flip-flopping of what
the criteria were when they were — as applied in 1970 and as
presently applied, and as apply after Mr. Addonizio was
sentenced and became eligible for parole.
QUESTION:

There certainly was a flip-flop by the

sentencing judge from the expressions he gave at the time of
sentencing and the expressions he made when he took his
final action.
MR. EDELSON:

Well, my time is up, but if I may just

respond to that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes.

I don't think fcher*e was a flip-flop at

Mayor of the City had ultimate responsibility for what he
felt was a horrendous crime, and he fashioned a specific

sentence to deal with that.

lines changed the import of that sentence radically.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr„ Greenspan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEON J. GREENSPAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS WHELAN AND FLAHERTY
MR. GREENSPAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I represent former Mayor Whelan and former Councilman
Flaherty from the city of Jerscsy City, New Jersey.
Thcjy, too, were sentenced under what was commonly
known as the Federal extortion statute for selling to the
public in general, whoever was willing to buy, their favors in
government.
Unlike Mr. Addonizio, Messrs. Whelan and Flahertv
were not connected with organized crime, and also unlike
Addonizio, they were sentenced to 15 years rather than 10
years.
Also unlike Addonizio, there was a tax problem that
was connected to the Whelan and Flaherty case, which was
resolved by

i

plea of guilty, and the imposition of a

sentence to run concurrently with the 15 years sentence.
Also unlike Addonizio, unfortunately, Judge Shaw
was presiding in a much higher court; he passed away.
Thereafter, an application was made in the district

38

courtfor the District of New Jersey, and it was referred to
Judge Biunno, who was presented with the problem of ascertain­
ing,

under the Third Circuit rule, what was the expectation

of Judge Shaw at the time that he passed the 15-year sentence.
I would submit to this Court that regardless of what
my brother, the Solicitor General, has to say, he is after the
fact attempting to ascertain what was the fact in 1970, and
prior to 1970, with regard to the expectations of sentencing
judges at the time that a sentence was passed upon any prisoner
or any convict before a judge.
And under the rule of U.S. v. Berry, the courts
themselves enunciated the fact that it was commonly known
that after one-third of the service of the sentence imposed,
the prisoner would be released unless there were factors that
were present at that time to determine that he should not be
released.
And I take the position that under the statutes as
they were then in existence, and as they would be applicable
today, that the onus shifted not so that it was now upon the
Parole Board or the Parole Commission to have a burden of
proof as to why a prisoner should not be released once he had
served the one-third of his sentence.
The statute that was in effect then was the statute
that my clients were sentenced under.

And they had every

right to expect that if they met the criteria, as they did,

39

that they would be released at the end of one-third, and Judge
Shaw had every right to expect, because that is what he had in
his mind at the time that he sentenced the two individuals,
simply because that was what was in the minds of all the
judges who were sentencing prisoners at that time, because
that's what the judges said was in their minds, and it says
so

u«5» v° Berry.
QUESTION:

Do you think Judge Shaw's rights survived

his death?
GREENSPAN:
rights.

It's not a question of Judge Shaw's

It's the question of rights of individuals under the

constitution to be protected from an impingement upon the
powers of the judiciary by the powers of the executive.
All that the judge is doing at the time that he
fixes a sentence, or in this case, at the time that he acts
under 225, to correct or modify a sentence, is to vindicate
the rights that are inherent in the individual to be sentenced
to a term of years that is no more than the judge wanted him
to serve at the time.
Now, if the Third Circuit uses language that the
judge was frustrated; that —- it's vindicating the judicial
function; all it's saying is that it's vindicating the rights
of individuals to have the judiciary determine how long they're
going to serve, .when it was the judiciary —
QUESTION:

Where do you find those rights?

You find

40

them in an act of Congress, don't you?
MR. GREENSPANs
is set up the courts.

No, sir.

All that. Congress does

The powers of the courts are inherent in

the constitution.
QUESTION:

You mean a judge could impose whatever

sentence he wanted after a guilty verdict, regardless of what
Congress has said about that?
MR. GREENSPAN:

No, sir.

What the Congress does is

pass the maximum sentence under which the court can — is
required to act.

That's a legislative function to determine

the limitations.
Once the judge passes the sentence, which are
within the limitations, then it's not the executive’s to say —
unless the court wishes to pass on to a certain degree its
rights in pronouncing the sentence to the executive — to
determine „
Not ifyou have a statute that says, yes, the judge
can make a sentence, pass a sentence, that will say, we are
going to sentence you at the discretion of the Attorney
General? or at the discretion of the Parole Commission.

But

that's not the case here.
You have a classic balance of power problem, one
that I haven't seen before this Court before? and that is,
where does the powers of the judiciary to vindicate not its
rights, but the rights of the individual, stop? and where does

41
the power of the executive begin?
I do not agree with the Solicitor General that
magically at the end of 120 days the courts have no powers
whatsoever to see what's happening.

I don't believe there’s

any magic in that 120 days, and I do believe that 2255 was
put there specifically for the purpose,, not of vindicating the
right of a judge, but of upholding the right of a judge to
vindicate the rights of the individuals.
QUESTION;
Federal rule?

What is your explanation, then, of the

You must have some explanation of it?

MR. GREENSPAN;
QUESTION;

Rule 35?

Yes.

MR. GREENSPAN;

I think that Rule 35 deals with

an entirely different proposition? that's not the proposition
we have before us.
I think that 2255 deals in a — if I may attempt to
explain it in this fashion — with a —
QUESTION;
2255.

— tell me what your explanation is of

Tell me what the explanation is of Rule 35, which you

say is such a different proposition?
MR. GREENSPAN:

If a judge has made a mistake, if

something has happened where a judge for one reason or
another wants to do something different, bat Congress has
given the judge the authority to change the sentence, for
whatever reason or no reason, the way I see Rule

35.

42

However, 2255 is entirely different, where a mistake
has been made in the nature of a quorum notice type of
problem, where something has happened which is a question of
fact, which was unavailable or unaware at the time that
whatever happened happened, that's when 2255 comes in.
QUESTION:

What about Affront! and Murray?

MR. GREENSPAN:

Affronti and Murray have absolutely

nothing to do with this.
QUESTION:

I know — that's why — I would expect you

to say that.
Why not?

They just say that the judge can't — hasn't

any power once he's — once the sentence has begun -- to change
his probation rule.
Don't they say that?
MR. GREENSPAN:

Sure, but it doesn't apply here,

simply because Affronti and Murray assume that the judge has
changed his mind; that the judge wants to do something
different than what ae's done.
QUESTION:

Yes, it certainly does.

And I thought

you said that 2255 would be available for the judge —
MR. GREENSPAN:

No, sir, I didn't say that.

I said

2255 would be available in a situation where the judge has
passed a sentence based upon a set of facts as he perceives
them at that time, and which were the fact, which were in
existence.

43

And in this case I would say, the state of the lav;
would be a fact that was in existence at that time.

2255

is available so that the judge can say, "Now, wait a minute.
I don't want something to happen today that's different than
1974."
QUESTION:

Well, what about — what if a judge

discovers that some facts -- what if the probation officer
came in and said, "Gee, I gave you a very bad report last
year.

This fellow should have rea!3.y gone on probation.

Instead, he's in the prison for five years."

And the judge

says, "What do you mean?"
Then he gives him some facts he didn't have.

And

the judge says, "Gee, if I'd known that, I'd have put him on
probation."
And the probation officer says, "Well, I listened to
that argument in the Supreme Court last week.

You've got

power under 2255 to effect a different result based on facts
you didn1t know."
MR. GREENSPAN:

If Your Honor please, I don't know

-y

that that wouldn't be a good rule.
rule.

But I'm not arguing that

I'm arguing something entirely different.
I'm arguing that where the judge has an intention,

where the facts were the facts at that point, and nothing
has changed, except that somebody else wants to treat it
differently, then 2255 applies.

44
I don't know that 22155 wouldn't apply under the fact
pattern which you've described to me,

I would suggest that it

does.
QUESTION:

Well, you’d have to do something about

Affront!, wouldn't you?
NR. GREENSPAN:

In that case, I certainly would.

not in the case that. I argue hare today.

But

I'd say Affront!

and Murray just have no place in this ax*guxnent, and I believe
that the brother in the Third Circuit so believed because
they didn't even discuss it.
I would suggest that we’re dealing with a question
of wherever you have a question as to who has to have the final
word in a conflict between co-equal branches of government,
that I believe that it’s the judiciary that has to have the
final word, unless there is a clear statutory or constitutional
mandate that the judiciary does not have the final word.
Otherwise, you're going to have the situation which
has been described as a judicial frustration, but it's not
really a judicial frustration — although the judge may feel
himself frustrated — but it is a frustration of the rights of
individual who is before the judicial system who is seeking to
have the expectations that was pronounced upon

him vindicated,

Now, I cannot accept any rule which would say that if
a judge has pronounced a sentence based on the state of the law
as it was then, under the facts as he perceived them to be,

45
as they were then, that the executive department could say,
"I'm sorry, judge.

We have decided that the sentence that

you gave was not severe enough.

We’re going to change that

sentence."
Now, there is no implicit or inherent right in the
executive department to do that.

There is the implicit right

in the judicial system to see that when a sentence is passed,
that the expectation of the judge was vindicated, because it
was the expectation of the judge that should be vindicated
in this point, and not the expectation of the executive
department.
QUESTION;

How can a judge, at that stage, have any

idea how the prisoner is going to conduct himself in prison
over a period of a few years, five years into the future?
MR. GREENSPAN;

He can't,

And that's precisely why

the only discretion that's invested in the executive department
under that set of circumstances is to determine whether or
not he ha3 adopted to the prison life, whether there is
going to be recidivistic tendencies, and whether the other
criteria which are set forth in the statutes and the a
regulations, are met.
QUESTION;

You mean

the Parole Board cannot take

into account the nature of the crime?
MR. GREENSPAN;

Absolutely not, simply because it

would — in my judgment -- be a violation of the constitutional

46

prohibition against double jeopardy.

You would be unconsti­

tutionally enhancing the amount of time the individual is going
to serve after the judge has already said, "I'm sentencing
you to this sentence because of the severity of the crime,"
and now the Parole Commission is going to say, "Well, now that
you've been sentenced because of the severity of your crime,
we're going to keep you longer because of the severity of the
crime."
It just doesn't —
QUESTION:

Longer than what?

MR. GREENSPAN;
QUESTION:

Excuse me, sir.

Longer than what?

MR. GREENSPAN;

Longer than the expectation of the

judge in sentencing, because of the severity

of the crime.

Now at the time it was one-third.
I —
QUESTION:

So the parole commission is just a rubber

stamp?
MR. GREENSPAN;

No, it's not just a rubber stamp.

I think that if this Court were to hold that there was no
right in the judge under 2255, the judge would be a rubber
stamp.
It would be — the judge would say, "I'm going to
pass a sentence
QUESTION;

That's not — I asked one question.

I

47
didn't say a word about the judge did I?
MR, GREENSPAN:
my own language.

No, you didn't, Your Honor,

That was

But that's what I would learn from that.

I think that we're dealing with a very, very
narrow, narrow issue, which is even getting narrower.

And

that is the question of what happens to sentences that ware
passed before 1973 when the individual was not released accord­
ing to what the expectation of the Court was at the time that
the sentence was passed.
As the years go by, we’re not going to be dealing
with many more of these cases.

I think that if there's a

constitutional issue before this Covart, it's merely, just
where do the rights of the judiciary end, and where do the
rights of the executive begin?
?

!4

I cannot see it in a

120(a) line.

There has

to be some sort of an overlap where there is some sort of
concurrent jurisdiction.

And we've argued that in our

brief, and we have specifically narrowed it in our brief.
Nov?, amicus has filed a brief which purports to argue
that certiorari was improviden;ly granted.

I would adopt that

argument, and I will not devote any more of my time to it.

I

believe it is well written in that brief.
I would just close by saying that this Court many
years ago in the Morton Salt case came to the conclusion that
executive officers cannot usurp judicial functions, or prevent

43
the court from exercising such functions.
If this Court ware to permit the Parole Commission,
under the peculiar facts in this case, to hold in prison
Messrs Whelan and Flaherty any longer than the time they’ve
already served, I would submit that they have usurped the
judicial function, and that they should not be permitted to
do so.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
