MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No, 77-1202* Michigan against Doran,
Mr. Derengoski, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A, DERENGGSKI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OERENGOBKI:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it

please the Court:
I first address the question in this cause of the
motion for dismissal on the grounds of mootness* which has
been filed by counsel for the Respondent herein.
extradition case.-

This is an

Exactly one year ago today the Michigan

Supreme Court handed down its decision setting aside
Mr, Doran’s incarceration and turning him free on the basis
that the extradition papers., the warrant and complaint from
Arizona* did not, on their face, show probable cause, and
that it was an argument and question and objection which
could be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding in the asylum
State of Michigan.
The motion for mootness indicates that counsel has
searched diligently for Mr. Doran and has been unable to find
him and that, therefore, any action by this Court could not
be effectively implemented.
I say to this Court, in opposition to the motion
for dismissal on the basis of mootness, that we, the State of

4
Michigan* with probably somewhat greater resources* have
not attempted to locate Mr, Doran.
it.

There is no reason for

After all* we couldn't do a thing to him.

It would only

be harassment if we did go out and look for him, X presume.
He is free by mandate of the Michigan Supreme Court.
Nov/* admittedly, at the moment* we do not know where
he is.

However* I would hate to say that precedent should be

that an appeal to this Court can be thwarted,, indeed* a party
may prevail by merely not showing up.
X would say to Your Honors that this is not the
concept which would evoke an order of this Court dismissing
on account of mootnees this cause.
New, except for this order of the Michigan Supreme
Court which we herein seek to set aside* there is a viable
Michigan Governor's warrant for the arrest of this man.

And

once this Court does set aside the Michigan decree* it will
be pursued and pursued diligently.

Otherwise* the very thing

that we are so fearful of as a result of the Michigan Supreme
Court's decision would* indeed* come true* namely* just keep
yourself absent* step over the boundaries into another state
and you are home free.
I have little doubt* Michigan being the home of
Mr .Doran and his family* or remnants thereof* are still
there* that in all likelihood he is in Michigan,
he be

Why shouldn't

5
QUESTION:

Would it make any difference whether he

is in Michigan or in Cuba, for the purposes of this case?
MR* OERENGOSKI:
QUESTION:

That's right, sir.

Well, it would make a difference If he

were in Arizona, would it not?
MR. DERENG03KI:

Yes, sir.

At the moment, I would suggest to Mr. Doran,
Michigan.

After ail, he is safes there.

He has the mandate

of the Michigan Supreme Court keeping him free.
Mow, the matter — I will proceed to the merits of
the cause.

We do not take exception to the claim and the

assertion that the provisos of the Fourth Amendment, namely,
probable cause for a warrant, are applicable to cases of
extradition.

Are big thrust is —

QUESTION:

You do concede --

MR. DERENGCbKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, we do.

This simplifies the case considerably.

MR. DERfiNGObKT:

We say that these are matters which

are to be examined in the courts of the demanding state.
concept of probable cause, I suggest to the Court, can be
somewhat gossamer.

What is, maybe, probable cause In the

mind of the Governor and the judge in Arizona may fall shy
of probable cause in the mind of the Michigan courts.
Obviously, it did.
On the other hand, this case went through four

The

6
Michigan courts before they found a court which said, "This
does not show probable cause within the concept that we have,
and therefore it must fail,, it can be raised in an ancillary
proceeding in habeas here and we will discharge this man„"
QUESTION;

Would you say that the asylum state may

at least demand that the demanding state, when it presents
its papers to the Governor of the asylum state— must the
demanding state at least show that probable cause has been
determined in that state before a warrant was issued?
MR» DERJ2NGQSKI:

Yes, sir.

And we believe that

that has been done here,
QUESTION:

Eo you think the asylum state may demand

not only that the demanding state demonstrate that probable
cause has been judicially determined in the demanding state,
but that the demanding state demonstrates the basis for that
determination?

I know you say that it cannot be redetermined

in the asylum, state,
MR, DEHSNGQaKI:

Yes, sir,

1 think that what we

have here is Michigan's examination of what Arizona found to
be probable cause.
QUESTION:

Re examination.

Why do you concede that with respect to probable
cause?

You are dealing with a provision of the Constitution

that was adopted in 178? about the Interstate Rendition of
Fugitives and you are dealing with a Fourth Amendment provision

7
that was held applicable to the states only in 1961,
MR. DERENGOSKI:

Yes, sir.

We, of course, rely nearly completely and wholly on
Article 1.

It is so clear.

QUESTION:

Article 1 of what?

MR. DERENGC8KI:

Of the United States Constitution,

which says that upon demand of the Governor of one state a
fugitive shall be rendered up to the demanding state.
QUESTION:

I thought that was Article 4, Section 2.

MR. DERENGOSKI:

I stand corrected, Article 4,

Section 2„
QUESTION:

Well, if you rely on that, why do you

get to the issue of probable cause under -QUESTION:

Why did you concede just what you did,

that the asylum state may at least demand that the ~~ a
showing that the demanding state passed on probable cause?
MR. DERENGOSKI:
concession, sir.
QUESTION:

I do not know that I made that

If I did, I certainly retract it.
Were you undertaking to tell us that

all the demanding state need to show is their prima facie
case of probable cause, by its papers?
MR. DERENGCBKI:

Yes, Sir.

The big complaint, as I get it, here is that the
affidavit in complaint pursuant to which the warrant of
arrest was issued merely stated the crljne in the, quote,

8
"conclusory," end quote, language of the statute, but it
showed who, what, where, when —
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, doesn't a warrant

show that Arizona said that this man stole a car in Arizona
on the same day he was under arrest in Michigan?
MR. DERENGQSKI:
QUESTION:

Is that possible?

MR» DERENG0SK1:
returned.
warrant.

Yes, sir.

No, sir, it was sent back and

It was a stenographic error in the original
It was corrected to show December 3, 1975* instead

of the same date on which he wae picked up in Michigan.
QUESTION:

But when was the warrant issued?

How

long after the crime?
MR. DERENGQaKI:

Let’s see.

We picked him up on

December ~QUEoTION:

I am talking about the Arizona --

MR. DERENGGSKI:

The Arizona, I think, it was issued

in the middle of January.
QUESTION:

It wasn't issued until after he was

picked up in Michigan?
MR. DERENGQSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And after Michigan notified Arizona, that

was when it was issued?
MR. DERENGQiKX:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Real cooperation.

9
MR* DERENGOSKI:
QUESTION;

When did you pick him up?

MR. DERENGOSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

We picked him up December 18# 1975«•

And when did the Arizona warrant issue?

MR. DERENGOSKI:

Arizona issued l/7/76j less than

a month later# the Arizona warrant issued# sir.
QUESTION:

Well# then# may it be said that the

Arizona authorities were relying on the Michigan arrest for
probable cause?
MR. DERENGOSKI:

No# sir# there was a complaint

made by the prosecutor in the Arizona court.
QUESTION:

When?

MR. DERENGOSKI:

It was sometime between December

18th and —
QUESTION:

Was it before or after the Michigan

arrest?
MR. DERENGCSKI:
QUESTION:

It was after# sir.

And it was after Michigan notified

Arizona»
MR. DERENGOSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.

And so far as the record shows# Arizona

didn't knew anything about it.
MR. DERENGUiKX:

That is right# sir.

They didn't

know where this man was until Michigan said# "We have him."
QUESTION:

It doesn't say that.

They could have

10

Issued the warrant without knowing where he was; couldn't
they?
MR. DERENGG3KI:
QUESTION:

Don’t they usually do that?

MR0 DERENGQSKI:
QUESTION:

I suppose» but to what avails sir?

Not to ray knowledge» no» sir.

Can you give me any case where this

happened» where a warrant was issued after the man was
arrested in another state?
MRo DERENGQEKI:

Most of the extraditions that I

have dealt with did that» yes» sir» after the asylum state
advised the ultimate» demanding state that» "We have one of
your people»"
QUESTION:

That's when they issued the warrant?

MR. DERENGOIKI:
QUESTION:

For arre3t.

MR„ DERENGOqKI:
QUESTION:

Yes» sir.

Often they don't know who he Is.

MR0 DERENGCbKI:
QUESTION:

Yes» sir.

That's right» yes» sir.

Until he is apprehended in the asylum

state.
MR. DfiRENGOiKX:

That's right.

And how this

happened» sir» he was driving this allegedly stolen vehicle
in Bay City» Michigan» and was making too much noise» as I
understand It and there was a complaint and officers came
and they checked through the lien and found that this was a

11

stolen vehicle from Arizona.

And he was charged in Michigan

with receiving and concealing stolen property3, which charge
was ultimately dismissed upon the arrival of the Arizona
requisition.
QUESTION:

And you kept him in jail two years,

MR. DERENGCSKX:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes* sir.

That would be a

What is the amount of time you get for

stealing a vehicle in Arizona?
MR. DERENGQSKI:

I suppose It is less than five

years, sir,
QUESTION:

It could be two* couldn't it?

, MR. DERENGCbKI:

It could, yes, sir.

But you have

to recalls sir, that during the time that he was incarcerated
in Bay City* he was attempting these habeas actions through
the Michigan, courts.

And you know* sir* it takes very little

imagination to know why this man would rather molder in a
Michigan jail than assert himself to his constitutional right
to a speedy trial in Arizona.
QUESTION:

He just wanted you to abide by the law*

that's all,
MR. DERENGQSKI:
QUESTION:

Now, historically

It takes very little imagination, but I

don't even have that minimal amount of imagination.

Why did

he — ■»
MRo OERENGCtjKI:

Obviously, he did not want to run

12

the risk of conviction and sentence in Arizona.
QUESTION:

He couldn’t be any worse off than being

in prison* could he?
MR* DERENGQSKX:
QUESTION:

Yea, sir.

I can't understand that.

You say it takes very little imagination

to see why he did what he did*
MR* DERENGQSKX:

Obviously* he believed the risk of

conviction end sentencing in Arizona was so very probable
that ha would rather sit in a Michigan jail*
QUESTION:

Well* that's a certainty* when you are

in jail* not a probability,
QUESTION:

He was there then pending the possession

charge in the State of Michigan., was he not?
MR* DERENGCSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.

When was that charge dismissed?

MR* PERENGQSKI:

It was dismissed in January of

1976* when the Arizona requisition arrived and the Governor
of Michigan issued his warrant of arrest* pursuant to
QUESTION:

So it was promptly dismissed* as soon ae

the people from Arizona arrived; is that right, or the
requisition arrived?
MR* OERENGOEKI:
QUESTION:

So the two years was after that*

MR. PERENGQSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes* sir.

You are suggesting he was following

13
Hamlet *s advice that*

"We would rather bear those evils we

have than flee to others that we know not of"?
MR, DERENGCbKI:
QUESTION:

Perhaps, sir, perhaps,

Or are you suggesting that Michigan jails

are warmer than Arizona ones, or something like that.
I share Mr, Justice Stewart's confusion about it
doesn't take much imagination to know why,
MR* DEHENGGSKI:

Obviously, he did not want the

Arizona conviction and probable sentence that would follow,
QUESTION:

And he correctly anticipated that if he

stuck it out in the Michigan courts he might ultimately get
free, which he did,
MR, DERENGCbKI:

Oh, yes, sir,

It took four courts,

but he made it.
QUESTION:

He is probably happier now than he would

have been after a trial in Arizona.
MR. DERENOOiKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Did you ever think that there is a good

possibility that this man is innocent?
MR. DERENGCbKI:
QUESTION:

Well, sir, yes, but --

Your assumption is that he was going to

be convicted in Arizona.
MR. jDERENGQbKI:

Oh, no, sir, I would never sub­

scribe to that,
QUESTION:

Didn't you just say that the reason he

14

did it was because if he went to Arizona he would be con­
victed^

Didn't you say that?
MR. DDRdNGOiKI:

He was obviously afraid of that,

yes, sir,
QUJiSTION:

Well, then, you don

assume that the man

is innocent,
MRe DERJSNGOiKI:

I will alvmys assume.

Evidently,

he didn't.
Historically

and under the rulings of this Court,

in the asylum state you may question the fugifcivifcy, ,the
identity of the accused -- in this case, we had his picture
-- and whether what he did was a crime, under the laws of the
demanding state, and whether he, indeed, was in the demanding
state at the time of the alleged crime.
QUESTION:

You say that is the end of the inquiry

by the asylum state?
MR, DERENGCbKI:

Yes, sir, just to make sure that

this man who is- charged., that he was in the demanding state
and that you have the right- person.
Now, the Michigan Supreme Court went off very heavily
on the District Circuit decision by Judge Skeiley Wright in
Kirkland.

They also

I would like to point out to the

Court that Justice Skeiley Wright, with all deference to him,
much of his opinion was based on compassion.

I say that is

a proper ingredient in the administration of our laws, but

15

should not be so weighted as to frustrate a constitutional
provision,

Judge Wright mentioned "hauling these people

away from their home to a foreign jurisdiction/' and all the
problems that could come in that regard,

While., actually,

in most of these cases, these people merely are. being sent
back home.

And in this particular case, xvs are not sending

these fugitives off to some primitive state, seme nether
region,

We are sending them off to a sister sovereign state

of this Union, whereby all of the constitutional rights will
be given to him,
QUESTION:

Well, the Governor of Michigan can

exercise compassion, under Kentucky v, uennison, if he wants
to, can't he?
MR, UERjiiNGQaKI:

Oh, yea, sir.

I am not sure that

Kentucky v » ben nils on says that.
QUESTION:

It says that duty can't be enforced by

mandamus,
MR, EERENGQiKI:

That’s right, sir.

I seriously

question the propriety of these governors in the exercise of
executive clemency doing by indirection arid frustrating
Article 4,
QUESTION:

We don't have that here, though.

MR. DERJtSNGQiKI:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

It wasn’t the governor who did this.

MR. OeRENGQvKI:

No, sir, it was not.

It was the

16

Michigan Supreme Court.,
oo I say to the Court all of these protections* these

arguments should be raised in the demanding state, where the
evidence is there, where the witnesses are there.

Unless we

can have that as the law of this land, you could have 48
states which bee cane havens for every bail bond jumper in the
country.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. BjiRENGOSKI:

Thank you, Mr. Derengoski,

X would like to reserve the remainder

of my time for any rebuttal that may be necessary.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Miss Cummins.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP KATHLEEN M. CUMMINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RES POND ENT
MISS CUMMIM.J :

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the C ourt:
First of all, 1 will address myself to the memorandum
suggesting mootness, which we filed.

I, by no means, intended

that this memorandum be taken as my assertion that this case
was definitely moot.

It was filed because I felt that

Mr. Loran’s continuing absence compelled me to inform the
Court of a set of facts that might well render the case moot.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It was entirely appropriate.

Miss Cummins, for you to do so.
MR, CUMMIN^:

I do have one additional fact to relate

17

to the Court which came to light after the memorandum was
filed, however.

Our investigator had contacted a Deputy

Sheriff in Bay County who knew Mr. Doran and had asked him to
look.for Mr. Doran,

.shortly after we received the Attorney

General’s response to our memorandum, this Deputy informed us
that he had seen Mr, Doran in a local hotel about two months
before last week.

However, he was unable to give us any

further infomafcion and our efforts to check out this lead
didn't reveal any further; information.
%

QUESTION:

That was a local hotel in the State of

Michigan?
Mlbo CUMMINS :

In Bay City.

We argued before the Michigan Supreme Court and they
took the position that where a request for rendition is based
on a mere charge, such as here, an untried charge, and where
the request is supported solely by a complaint and warrant
and/or additional supporting affidavits, that such charging
documents must facially reflect probable cause,
.secondly

QUESTION:

Miss Cummins, is there any explanation

in the record as to the original Michigan arrest?
MlDo CUMMINo :

Well, the record is somewhat murky

as to the details surrounding Mr. Doran's original -QUESTION:

What wag h® agrigsfcii# fwt

MUD CUMMIN- ;

He was arrested on a charge of

18

possession of a stolen vehicle in Bay City on December 18th -~
QUESTION:

This is the same vehicle?

MISS CUMMINS:
QUESTION;

How do you know it is the same vehicle?

MISS CUMMINS:
driven from Arizona,
QUESTION:

Yes .

It was a vehicle in which he had
There is no dispute about that,

He was arrested because he was driving a

car without a state license?
MISS CUMMINS :

Apparently# a check -« and I am not

sure of this and the record does not really clear up this
question»-- Apparently a check was run on the plates and this
check revealed that it was a stolen vehicle,
QUESTION:

But that was after he was arrested,

MXhS CUMMINa:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

If you will back up a little, I want to

know when he was arrested, they said, "You are arrested" for
what?
MU*., CUMMINS :

I don’t believe that was ever made

certain, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Vie don't know# do we?

MI33 CUMMINS:

Mo.

He was, shortly thereafter# charged with receiving and
concealing a stolen vehicle.

However# after the Arizona warrant

and complaint were issued and a fugitive warrant was issued in
Michigan to hold Mr, Doran for extradition, the local charge

19

itfas dropped on February 5* 3.976,
The Michigan Supreme Court was faced with a real,
dilemma here*

They had to decide whether or not they could

extradite an accused fugitive not a person convicted of crime
or a person who had violated parole or who had jumped bond,,
but a person charged with crime in another state,
QUESTION:
Miss Cummins?

Isn’t that what most extraditions are,

The overwhelming majority are relating to

persons merely charged.
Miae CUMMINo :

Yes, Your Honor, I don't know what-

the statistics are on that.

However, it is significant in

this case —
QUESTION:

Loesn't the Constitution say that, "A person

charged in any state with treason, felony or other crime who
shall flee from justice and be found in another state, shall
on demand of the executive authority of the state from which
he fled be delivered up"?
MXEO CUMMINO:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr,, Justice Rehnqu 1st,

Where is the dilemma then?

MIEE CUMMINe:

I don’t dispute the fact that ex­

tradition may be had on a mere charge.

However, here the

Michigan supreme Court was provided *»- or the Michigan
Governor, originally, was provided with documents in support
of this charge which did not contain any particulars supporting
the charge, whatsoever

20

QUESTION:

Coes the Michigan Supreme Court review

the Governor's exercise of discretion or do they review under
the Constitution and the Federal Act?
MIS.J CUMMINS :

They are acting as a habeas corpus

court that hacs traditionally been provided to accused fugitives.
Mow, what they had before them v/ere a warrant, a
complaint and an affidavit that were framed entirely in
conclusions, not only -QUESTION:

They certainly indicated that a charge

had been made.
MIcd CUMMIN^:

Yes, they indicated that a charge

had been made.
QUESTION:

And held that despite the Constitution

something -- some papers indicating something besides a charge
was necessary.
MJSo CUMMINS:

No, Your Honor.

What they said was

that papers -- a complaint and warrant were submitted in
support of an extradition request, that that complaint and
warrant and other supporting affidavits, or whatever, had
to reflect on their face sufficient details to support a
probable cause finding.
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes they must show

something besides the charge?
MXEd CUMMINO:

Yes, they must show something besides

a mere conclusion that probable cause has been found in the

21

mere name of the charge,;
}'

QUESTION:
jury.

Suppose he had been indicted by a grand

Could the Michigan courts reexamine the basis upon which

the grand jury indicted?
MISS CUMMINS :

No, Your Honor,, and the Michigan

Supreme Court distinguished that situation.

They said, "We

are not dealing here with an indictment."
QUESTION:

That’s all.

They said, "We are not?*"

dealing with it, but could they?
MISS CUMMINo:
QUESTION:

No, they couldn't reach that,

And what's the reason for that, because

the Constitution uses the word "shall" surrender up?
MIoS CUMMINo:

I believe the reason for the dis­

tinction was that a grand! jury indictment imports a finding
of probable cause or at least a finding that is equivalent,
that the law views as equivalent to finding probable cause,
QUESTION:

What if just a charge, without any

supporting papers, had been furnished to the Michigan author;.-*
ties?

Would the Michigan Supreme Court have come out the

same way, in your view?
MI-o CUMMIM, :

I think more so,

They would have come

out more emphatically.
QUESTION:

oo that, it isn't a question of the

Arizona authorities having furnished too much.

It is a

question ythat any demanding state must furnish not only

22

evidence of a charge, but evidence of probable cause*
MIBB CUMMINB:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

How do you reconcile that with the

statement in Matter of Bfcrauss, the opinion of this Court
by Justice Brewer, where he says that, "Who would doubt that
an information is sufficient"?
MIBB CUMMINS:

I think what Matter of Strauss is

really dealing with was at what stage does the criminal
prosecution have to be advanced before extradition can be
had upon that, charge?

In Matter of Bt rausa, the Petitioner

was arguing that since the prosecution had not advanced beyond
a mere charge, had not advanced to the stage where he had been
bound over for trial, that extradition couldn't be had on this
basis,
QUESTION:

But in Btrauss the Court does say informa~
/ /

felon would be sufficient,which is what was involved in
■/

Gersteln v, Pugh and this Court held was not sufficient for

■;

I

probable cause,
MIBB CUMMINB :

Yes, Your Honor, but perhaps,at least

as far as that proposition is evident in Matter of Strauss,
that case should be reexamined in the light of Gersteln,
But we don’t have any dispute with Btrauss1 basic
proposition that a mere charge is enough and that the meaning
of the word "charge" is to be construed liberally,
QUESTION:

What, in fact, Miss Cummins, was furnished

23

by the demanding state, by Arizona, in this case?
MISS CUMMINS:

The demanding state furnished a

warrant supported by a complaint.

The warrant ant complaint

were virtually identical in their language.

They recited the

charging language of the Arizona statutes for theft of an
automobile, or, in the alternative, embezzlement of an automobile.

The complaint was sworn out by a police officer.

It was made expressly on information and belief,
QUESTION:

Sworn to?

MISS CUMMIN;:
QUESTION:

Sworn to before a magistrate,

So, it would be — The constitutional

provision says a person charged in any state, and tnafe *s the
extent of what it says in that respect, and the s-atute
says that if the demanding state produces a copy of an
indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate,
Would you concede that the complaint fits that
description, an affidavit made before a magistrate? Fits
the statutory requirement, the language?
MIES CUMMINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It wasn't an insufficient demand so far

as the statutory language goes?
MIES CUMMIN.;:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

The Solicitor General said that date of

December was changed.
MXSo CUMMINS:

Where is that in the record?
Well, the complaint was amended to

24

change the date of the offense from December I8teh -QUESTION:

Is that in the Appendix?

Mibb CUMMINb:

I don’t believe the amended complaint

is in the Appendix.
QUESTION:

How does it get before us?

MIsb CUMMINo:

Well, I was under the impression that

the Court had at its disposal the complete record.
QUESTION:

We do.

QUESTION:

Well, didn’t you work on this Appendix?

Mlba CUMMINS:
QUESTION:

Yes. I did.

And you left two documents in here that

were corrected and you didn’t put the corrected ones in.
MISs CUMMINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

However, I did

MISS CUMMINS!

Yes* a warrant accompanied the com-

plainto
QUESTION;

Yes* but it was an arrest warrant?

MISS CUMMINS:
QUESTION:

Yes* it was.

I wondered -- My brother* Rehnquist,

asked you about Strauss earlier.
from Strauss:

There is another excerpt

"Doubtless the word 'charged' was used in its

broad signification to cover any proceeding vjhich a state might
see fit to adopt* by which a formal accusation was made against
an alleged criminal.

In the strictest sense of the term* a

party is charged when an affidavit is filed* alleging the
commission of the offense and a warrant is issued for his
arrest."
And this is true whether a final trial may or may
not be had upon such charge.
Now* wasn't that test of Strauss satisfied by the
papers that were filed in Michigan in this case*, by Ariscna?
MISS CUMMINS:

Yes, Your Honor, papers were filed

which charged a crime*
QUESTION:

My question is:

There was a charge,

a sworn charge of a crime in Arizona, together with an
arrest warrant that issued*

Doesn't Strauss suggest that that

is enough to satisfy the requirement?
MISS CUMINS :

Strauss merely ~~ In my interpretation,,

Strauss takes a liberal view of the meaning of the word

26

"charged,11 not as to the substance of the charge, but as to
how advanced the charge has to be* how advanced the prosecu­
tion has to be.
QUESTION?

My real question was;

Wasn’t everything

that was submitted by Arizona fco the Governor of Michigan in
this case — Did not those papers together satisfy what
Strauss said would satisfy?
MISd CUMMINS;
QUi&TXQN:

Yes* Your Honor* definitely.

Then why doesn’t atrauss cover this —

and call for a reversal?
MISo CUMMINo;

Because I think that Strauss has

expanded, or at least further clarified by other holdings
of this Court, extradition cases* which state upon habeas
corpus review of the demanding state's charging documents*
an accused may raise the question of the substantiality of the
charge, and that this is a question of law and that it is
limited to the face —
QUESTION:

An issue that Strauss didn’t deal with,

that's your point, isn't it?
MISd CUMMINS*
QUESTION;

That was not an issue in Strauss

MISS CUMMINo;
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor ,,

This warrant also recited, however, that

a magistrate had found reasonable cause fco believe.

They

didn't just recite a charge, but he affirmatively recited in

2?

the warrant that he had found reasonable cause to believe
that the accused committed the crime.
MISS CUMMINS:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor, but that --

And you suggest that there must be some

facts to support that* is that It?

Not only some facts, but

enough facts to satisfy the asylum state that there really is
probable cause.
MISS CUMMIM;':
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor.

The other document filed gives the name

— the motor number of the vehicle, describes the vehicle,
the regist©3"ed owner of the vehicle^and says he took it from
that person on such and such a date.

Wouldn't that be enough

substantiation of the fact that there was probable cause,
together with the conclusory statement of the magistrate
that "I have found probable cause"?
Kovj

Why do you need more?

much more do you need?
MI’S CUMMINS :

are really not facts.
QUESTION:

Weil, these details that you mention
They are conclusions.

Didn't the arresting officers in Michigan

verify that this was a vehicle and they arrested him because
he was thought to be in possession of a stolen vehicle?
Didn't they know this?
MlDo CUMMIND:

They knew no more than the complaint,

which was eventually issued, which was stated on information
and belief

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the charge in

Michigan had no basis, the Michigan criminal charge against
this man that was dismissed?

Are you telling us that that had

no basis In law and fact?
MIDI CUMMINd:

It is quite possible.

The details

surrounding that charge* as I mentioned* are extremely murky.
The important point here is that the details surrounding the
Arizona charge are also extremely murky,

We have the owner’s

name* we have the vehicle number* we have the defendant's
name- we have the names of the relevant statutes involved,
we have a conclusion stated on information and belief that

MISS CUMMINS ;
QUESTION:

Oh* yes* Your Honor,

You seem to be calling for some evidence*

rather than ultimate facts,
MXSJ CUMMINSj
for evidence.

Mr, Chief Justice* we are not calling

The Michigan Supreme Court was careful to point

out we do not suggest that we inquire into the underlying
facts,

What they were attempting to do was make a confirma­

tion of probable cause* based only on the face of the docu­
ments* not inquiring Into the merits of the criminal prosecu­
tion,

Because, as this Court has noted, the question of

probable cause is viewed as extraneous to the question of

29

guilt or innocense.

And what the Michigan Supreme Court was

compelled to find was that these papers, on their face, were
factually deficient to show probable cause and, hence, could
not provide a factual basis for a magistrate's Independent
finding of probable cause.
QUESTION:

Didn't some official in the State of

Michigan make a determination of facts that are essentially
consistent with the determination made by the magistrate in

QUESTION:

I am not speaking of the Governor, I am

speaking of whatever judicial or other officer caused to be
filed a charge against Doran in Michigan courts.

That was

for possession of the stolen car, wasn't it?
MISS CUMMINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Suppose there is a deficiency,-for the

moment.;» in the conclusions that you object to.

Aren't they

supplied to the State of Michigan by Michigan's own action?
Michigan has found that this man has a stolen car in his
possession, and it happens to be the same car that Arizona
said he took out of the State of Arizona.
MISS CUMMINS:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but the issues

in a case of receiving and concealing a stolen vehicle are
different from the issues involved in a charge of larceny.

30

And, further * as I said before,, I am not willing to
concede that the charge in Michigan was founded.

And* even

if it were* the papers that Michigan was presented with —
even If there were additional details that could have been
brought to Michigan's attention* what was brought to
Michigan's attention was not sufficient to permit an inde­
pendent assessment of the question of probable cause by
Michigan,

The Michigan Supreme Court held that they have

that right not to hold an evidentiary hearing in the asylum
state to determine whether or not probable cause existed* but
merely to confirm the question of probable cause,
QUESTION:

Well* the Michigan Supreme Court really

didn't hold that they had that right in the sense that
Governor Milliken had that right.

They said that Governor

Milliken couldn't execute the extradition warrant because the
Federal Constitution prohibited from doing so, until they
made that determination* didn’t they?

This wasn't a question

of Kentucky v. Dennison type thing, where Michigan voluntarily
says* "We won't do it until we are satisfied."
MISS CUMMINS:

No* the Michigan Supreme Court stated

categorically* "This state cannot extradite unless provided
with sufficient details*" in a case like this to confirm a
showing of probable cause.
QUESTION:

And the reason was the Federal Constitution,

MIbd CUMMINS:

Yes

QUESTION;

Miss Cummins* I have before me the

record which consists of a certification of the record* the
briefs and appendixes and opinions of the Court»

Now* where

is the material that is going to show me what you relate?
MISS CUMMIN.- ;

Well* Mr„ Justice Marshall* perhaps

this confusion is resulting from my ignorance of this Court's
procedural rules about whose responsibility it is to bring up
the entire record»

It was my — When I received the rules

QUESTION:

All I am saying* Madam —

MISS CUMMINS;

-- the appendix need not be complete

because the Court would have the whole record before it.
QUESTION:

All I am saying is that you told me it

MISS CUMMINS:

I assumed It was here* Your Honor»

QUESTION:

Thank you»

QUESTION:

Miss Cummins* I suppose it is completely

Irrelevant* but does the record show whether the Arizona Justice
of the Peace who .Issued the arrest warrant was a lawyer?
MICE CUMMINS:

No. Your Honor* as a matter of fact*

the record does not show that.

In Arizona* I believe*

justices of the peace ure not required t o be lawyers *
QUESTION:

Secondly* is- there any evidence in the

record that the justice of the peace had before her fch€i

32

nine-page report that is referred to in the supporting
affidavit of February 3?
MIBB CUMMINS:

There is an indication that she

didn't have it before her, because that affidavit was issued
February 3rd,and the warrant and complaint were iusuecJ
January 7th.
QUESTION:

But we don't really know that -- the

totality of what was before the justice of the peace.

They

might have been personal statements.
MISS CUMMINS:

There might have been.

The Arizona

procedure, as pointed out by the Attorney General, does
provide for an additional investigation.

As a matter of

fact, it makes it the magistrate's duty when faced with
a complaint based solely on information and belief, such as
here.

However, here there is no indication that such an

additional investigation ever took place.

And the facts of

the complaint and warrant, and just the way that they are
framed, such as the amendment of the date of the offense
and the fact that the offenses are stated in the alternative,
A

seem to indicate that Arizona did not have additional facts,
But if they did have additional facts, it would have been of
little imposition on them and very little imposition on the
extradition process to have included those additional facts
in the face of their extradition supporting documents.
that's all we are requesting here.

And

We never suggested that

33
the scope of extradition habeas corpus should be expanded
beyond an analysis of the face of the documents.

All we

are suggesting is that this is really a minimal safeguard to
impose in light of the very# very serious threat to personal
liberty caused by extradition.
QUESTION;

I suppose you would permit the demanding

state to participate in the hearing?
MISS CUMMINS;

If they had expressed any interest

in doing so* yes.
QUESTION;

Would you permit them to present evidence

of probable cause?
MISS CUMMINS:

Yes* Your Honor* although we are not

suggesting that habeas corpus review be expanded beyond a
legal revisit of the sufficiency of the documents.

And I

think that if that were proposed that that would present a
serious question of whether or not the extradition process
was being encumbered and whether cr not' that would thwart
one of the aims of the extradition clause.
QUESTION;

You mean if the asylum state determined

that the papers were insufficient* that it would really
expedite extradition to say the demanding state couldn't even
supplement the information?
MISS CUMMINS:

Oh* no* Your Honor.

be interpreted as saying that.

I don't want fco

What I am suggesting here is

just the minimal requirement* the bottom line* that if they

34
don't wish fco make a factual presentation in the asylum court,
and certainly they are not required to do so* that they at
least provide papers showing probable cause* or at some later
date provide additional facts upon which probable cause can
be confirmed* and that was never done here,
QUESTION:

But no matter hex* probable cause is

determined in the demanding state or had been determined*
you would say the asylum state has a constitutional obligation
to review that determination?
MISS CUMMINS:

Yes* Your Honor* because if confirma­

tion of probable cause is not hod In the asylum state prior fco
rendition* then the accused will have no Fourth Amendment
remedy for extradition*once extradition takes place.
QUESTION:

All Cerate in said Is that there must be

a probable cause determination* isn't it?
•MIUS CUMMINS:
QUESTION:

Yes *

If the demanding state says there has

been* and you have no reason to dcubt that that event took
place, why doesn't Gerstein satisfy?
MISS CUMMINS:

Because Gerstein requires probable

cause determination by a neutral and detached magistrate.
QUESTION:

I know, but the papers here show that

there was one in the demanding state.
MISS CUMMINS:

Your Honor* this Court has always

held that a probable cause finding by a neutral and detached

35
magistrate may be subject to review to determine if there
were facts before the magistrate, which really indicate
that he made an independent assessment of probable cause»
QUESTION;

Not in the asylum state.

MISS CUMMINS:

But in the situation of a conventional

arrest or conventional search warrant.

And here extradition

poses arguably an even more significant restraint than a mere
arrest or search.

And since the accused will have no Fourth

Amendment remedy for extradition, once he returns, it is
essential to require that the asylum state be able to act
as a reviewing court and make the determination of probable
cause, based on facts sufficient to show that the magistrate
acted independently and was not merely rubber stamping the
conclusions of the police.

And if there was ever an example

of rubber stamping, it exists in the Arizona documents here.

38

QUESTION:

Well, that’s saying she acted wrongly,

not that she was not neutral and detached„
MISS CUMMINS:

Fart of the neutral and detached

requirement extends to whether or not the facts are sufficient
to convince — a) to support an independent finding, a
detached finding; and b) to satisfy the reviewing court
that such a detached finding was made.
QUESTION:

In Chadwick v. City of Tampa,which Justice

Powell wrote for the Court some years ago, we held that city
clerks of Tampa were neutral and detached magistrates, and
I don’t think we felt It encumbent to review all the probable
cause determinations they had made in the course of six months
or a year, to decide whether they were neutral and detached.

It is just a question of whether you are separate from the
prosecuting arm.
MISS CUMMINS:

Yes, that’s one aspect of the

neutral and detached requirement that was reviewed in
Chadwick v0 Tamps, and the question there was whether or not
clerks of the court could be judicial officers.

MISS CUMMINS;

Not necessarily* Your Honor, but

in an extradition case, not a renewed finding,, not a
rehearing, but a confirmation of the existence of probable
cause must be made if the accused rights are to be protected.
QUESTION:

Of course, as a practical matter, this

man had spent more than two years in^a Michigan jail when
he might have had this whole matter resolved, by simply
responding to the extradition.
