PROCE E D I H G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments next

in 77-952# Group Life and Health Insurance Company# etc.# efc el.#
versus Royal Drug Company # ©t al.
Mr. Kaiser# you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITHSR E. KAISER# ESQ.
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KAISER?

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

courtt
I represent Group Life and Health Insurance Company
also known as Blue Shield of Texas.

This case involves the

construction of the exemption to the Antitrust Laws established
under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
There is only one issue before the Court in this
case# and that issue is whether the statutory term# "business
■of insurance"# as contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act
includes the contract between an insurer and a health care
provider to furnish benefits owed to the policyholders under the
insurer's health care service benefit policies.

We talk only

about one issue.
Blue Shield's health care service benefit policies# anc.
in particular the prescription drug pharmacy policy which we
talk about today# are a tripartite service benefit agreement.
The tripartite service benefit agreement is composed of a policy
between an insurer and an insured obligating the insurer to

furnish benefits to the insured in the form of goods and ser­
vices as opposed to cash reimbursement*
A second feature of the tripartite service benefit
agreement is that it expressly obligates the insurer to enter
into a provider agreement, in this instance, Your Honors, a
Pharmacy Agreement, to provide the goods and services which are
•the risk underwritten or the risk assumed in the policy*
QUESTIONs
Kaiser,

I want to be sure I understood you, Mr*

You began by saying it is a tripartite situation*

And

did you say that the contract between your client, Blue Cross,
and —
MR, KAISERs
QUESTION:

Blue Shield, Your Honor*
Blue Shield and the insured expressly

provides that Blue Shield shall enter into a contract with the
suppliers?
MR, KAISER:

It expressly provides that the benefits

will be provided to the insured through a participating provider
and it obligates the insurer to enter into participating
agreements with providers*
QUESTION:

In other words, it would be inconsistent

with the insurance contract if Blue Shield itself were to go
into the business of being a pharmacist and itself provided the

MR, KAISER:
Your Honor,

With this policy, it certainly would,

5
This policy only provides that Blue Shield will
contract with the provider to provides goods and services or
needed goods and services in the form of prescription drugs»
QUESTIONS

And Blue Shield could not have its own

drugstores under this insurance policy?
MR» KAISER2
QUESTIONt

Mo, sir* not under this policy»
Mr» Kaiser* what is the business reason

either from the point of the view of the insured or the insurer
for requiring in the policy between those two that Blue Shield
enter into an agreement with providers?
MR» KAISERs
of history»

Your Honor* that involves a little bit

The business reason in this particular instance

was that the insureds and the beneficiaries insisted on that
type of policy.
The insureds under tha policy that we are

or under

the forerunners of our policy were the domestic automobile
4■

manufacturers. During a rather prolonged strike in 1967* one
of the major issues between the unions and the manufacturers
was additional fringe benefits* specifically health insurance
benefits.
Out of that collective bargaining agreement between
the unions and the domestic automobile manufacturers arose an
agreement that the. domestic automobile manufacturers would in
fact provide health insurance benefits in the form of full
coverage service benefit provider agreements.

6
Our tripartite agreement here is the end result of
that collective bargaining agreement.

Wow we are not saying

that we are connected with the unions or the auto manufacturers.
We are saying though, Your Honor, that the insureds and their
beneficiaries — the insureds being the automobile manufacturers
and the beneficiaries being their employees and the employees®
families — insisted on this type of arrangement.
QUESTION!

Why did they insist on it?

MR. KAISER!

They wanted full benefits coverage, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

But could they not get that sort of

coverage and leave it up to the insurer to decide how he was
going to go about procuring the benefits?
MR. KAISER:

That could have been done, Your Honor.

However, it was insisted that provider agreements be included
in this type of policy.

This entire tripartite agreement was

not conceived or instigated by Blue Shield.

It was conceived

and instigated by the insureds and beneficiaries from the very
beginning.
QUESTION:

In other words, the reason that the

insurance contract contains the provisions that it does is
largely a historic reason.

It is not essential that the contract

be that way, I mean if you were doing it now from scratch, but
there are historic reasons why the contract is as it is?
MR. KAISER:

The essential provisions in the policy

7
dealing with benefits and coverage were all insisted and, in
fact, demanded by the insureds and the beneficiaries *
QUESTIONS

As a matter of historic fact.

MR. KAISER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Would it be fair to say in broader terms

than you have cast it that this was a response to the demand of
consumers?
MR. KAISER:
QUESTION:

Mo doubt about it, Your Honor.
It would not just be limited to the auto­

mobile people?
MR. KAISER:

Mo, sir, and it has not been limited to

the automobile people.

Normally,

MR. KAISER:

Yes, sir.
The beneficiary receives money directly

from the insurance company.

There is no reason why it should

not receive benefits in kind directly from the insurance company
directly or through a subsidiary, is there?

QUESTIONi

This is net inexorably a tripartite

The logic does not inexorably require that it be

a tripartite agreement?
MR. KAISER*

I might add, Tour Honors, that tripartite

service benefits agreements are a distinctive feature of the
health insurance industry.

That is- for a number of reasons*

MR. KAISER:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
But that is not necessarily tripartite.

He just gets the money from the insurance company.
MR. KAISER:

There is another distinctive feature

of this particular type of arrangement and that is that under

QUESTIONS

Xfc

is not a full coverage, is it?

There

is a $2«00 deductible*
MR* KAISER;

There is a $2.00 deductible here with

each prescription.
QUESTION;

So that is not full coverage then, is

it?
MR. KAISER;

No, lour Honor.

Over and above the $2.00 deductible, there is full
coverage.
QUESTION;

Well, how is 'this any different than the

old-fashioned automobile policy or liability policy in which
the insurance company agrees to provide the defense the the
insured gets sued, and the company then hires lawyers to
represent the policyholder and provides, in effect, the benefit
in kind through the services of the lawyer and, therefore,
enters into agreements with the lawyers to work at such and
such a rate and be available and so forth*

Is that not just

like this?
MR. KAISER;

Your Honor, I cannot agree that the

health insurance industry is anything at all like the casualty
insurance industry because of the very peculiar nature*
QUESTION;

I am talking about the contractual arrange1

meat between the liability insurance carrier and the lawyer
who defends cases from time to time for the benefit of the
policyholder.

Why is that any different or is it any different

IQ
from agreements between the health insurance carrier mid the
drug company that will provide drugs?
MR. KAISER:

Inasmuch as you are talking about that

being a part of the benefit?; and coverage of the policy —
QUESTIONi
HR» KAISER:
QUESTION s

Correct.
~~ there is really no difference»
So if you are correct and you may well

be that this is the business of insurance, then lawyers when
they represent insureds under liability policies are equally
engaged in the business of insurance?
MS. KAISER:

No, Your Honor, I do not think so.

cannot cay that because for a very simple reason.

X

We say that

there is a bright line standard to be drawn here and what is
included in the business of insurance in the context of our
case — and we are balking about a provider agreement

does

not encompass everything that an insurance company can do.
It does not encompass every contract that an insurance
could enter into.
QUESTION:

But it might well encompass a provider

agreement when the agreement involves the probation of legal
services to somebody who is sued as a result of an automobile
accident.

2 do not see why you would run away from

that.

That helps you? it does not hurt you.
MR. KAISER:
but ~~

Your Honor, X am not arguing the court,

11
QUESTION;

I would not if I were you.

You can argue

all you want, but not on this basis because that is in your
favor.
You cannot distinguish between the variance in the
case Justice Stevens posed was servicesi here it is goods.
MR. KAISERs
QUESTION?

Goods and services, Your Honor.
And unless someone can distinguish between

those two variances from the normal concept of insmr&’bce * that
is very strongly in your favor.
MR. KAISER;

Ho.

I think that that is the normal

concept of insurance as understood.

I just do not want the

Court to think that I am coming in hare arguing for the auto-'
mobile casualty insurance industry when I am not.
Wo believe that the health insurance industry is
somewhat di£ferent.
QUESTIONs

Well, X happen to disagree with my

brother Stewart’s comment that your answer to Justice Stevens’
question helps you rather than hurts you.

And I do not see

the bright line that you are talking about between an agreement
on the part of a casualty insurance company with a law firm
to defend its policyholders in lawsuits which *— in which they
are sued, and an agreement with drugstores or pharmaceutical
houses to provide drugs where the casualty insured against is
•in need of drugs.
MTU KAISERs

Your Honor, we think that the proper line

.12
is that an agreement —™ a third party agreement which relates
directly to the provision of benefits, those benefits which
are underwritten in the policy„ and anything in that, agreement
which directly relates to the cost of those benefits to be
delivered and which are underwritten in the policy would con-»
stitute a part of the business of insurance for McC&j.re aFerguson, for instance»
QUESTIONs

But Justice Stevens' question meets every

one of the criteria you just set. forth? the covenant on the
part of casualty insured to defend the insured if he is sued
as a result of an accident.
If l am wrong

in thinking so,, tell me why 1 am

wrong.
MR. KAISERs
policy there.

Your Honor, there is no service benefit

I mean, there is no tripartite agreement there.

There is no tripartite agreement that has been established by
the insured.
QUESTION §
as a part

So if the insured simply went ahead and

of the policy with the — if the insurer went ahead

and as a part of the policy with the insured said, "We are
also going to draw up an agreement with the law firm to provide
services to you" and that is part of this policy, then the
two would be the same?
MR. KAISERs

Your Honor, I think we are getting very

close to prepaid legal services in many states, which have been

13
proposed to be operated in just that fashion»
QUESTIONS

Is it not true that soma firms? some policies

with insurance besides replacing the casualty loss* fire or
whatever? also provide a fixed amount for the loss of profits
during the period when the building or the plant or the factory
is being rehabilitated ? and you certainly would not say that
that takes it out of the business of insurance because it goes
that.fars would you?
MR» KAISERt

Without knowing the full terms of the

policy and the requireaieats of the insurer — the contractual
obligations of the insurer? I am not really sure that I can
comment on that.
The Pharmacy Agreement in this particular instance
though is the integral and indispensable part of the. tripartite
agreement.

Without, it? neither the policy -- the policy is

not effective and without the policy then th© Pharmacy Agreement
is not effectiva.
QUESTIONS

I would like to go back because I am not

at all clear in light of the way you started out your argument.
Xou emphasised the fact that historically this arrangement was
a result of collective bargaining and you seem to think that
that was important to your case.
As I understood the briefs that have been filed in this
case? the arrangement is supposed to be beneficial to the con­
sumer and also to Blue Shield? your client — financially

14
beneficial in terms of lower rates to the consumer# the public,
the insured,

to 1. correct in understanding that is your

position?
MR. KAISER:

Your Honor# first of all# let ra& — maybe

I misunderstood you# but we are not hinging our case upon the
fact that this arose out of a collective bargaining agreement.
The essential fact there though is that this type
of policy was demanded by the insureds and the beneficiaries.
That is how wo got into ~
QUESTION s

Demanded because it offered this coverage

at lower rates?
MR. KAISER:
QUESTIONs
MR. KAISERs

Precisely, Your Honor.
Kell, I hadn’t heard you say that.
It offers full coverage and at lower

rates and it guarantees the provision of benefits.
QUESTIONS

tod it in a sense protects, 2 understood

from your argument and your brief# the Blue Shield Company
and similar insurers from the hazard of perhaps higher charges
by pharmaceutical retail outlets around the state.
MR, KAISER;

One of the principal policies behind

e enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act was that insurance
companies be able to maintain themselves# manage their own
business subject to regulation by the states# and that they
be able to# in managing their business# more fully assess their
risks and provide solvency for their policyholders.

15
This provides the reliability that a:a insurance
company mast have.

That is one of the reasons for the Pharmacy

Agreement because it does-

in fact assist Blue Shield in
i

controlling the cost of the risk that it has assumed.

It

controls the magnitude of the risk so to speak.
And in such a situation as her®* where we have a
full benefits coverage policy open-ended, these is no limit
fco this policy.
QUESTION?

For all of these reasons I would have

thought Blue Shield would have wanted this without regard to
any pressure from the labor unions.
ME. KAISERt

I am sorry, Your Honor, I did not

understand.
QUESTION*

I said for all of these economic reasons

I ‘would have thought Blue Shield, as a business operation
serving the public, would have wanted this sort of contract
without regard to any pressure from
ME. KAISERs

a labor union.

Your Honor, 'these tripartite benefit

arrangement policies have been in effect since the early 1930s.
They were an outgrowth of the depression when people could not
get adequate health care service at a reasonable cost.
It initially started out with a three-party arrangement
between the insurer and hospitals and the insured.

By 1940

these three-party arrangements had increased to where they
had 4 million subscribers across the United States.

16
This is not sonething new.

Subsequent to that,

insurers began to enter into three-party arrangements for the
precise reasons that we have for — with physicians to provide
physician services to the insureds.
In 1944 during the Joint Senate/House debates on the
passage of the McCarran-Ferguson exemption, Attorney General
Biddle made an express comment referring to the tripartite
nature of these service benefit policies.

And in his comment

he said that the insurance —* or the policy that they were
talking about — the arrangements that they were talking about
during the discussions fits but one word and that perfectly.
He said that word is the "business" or is "insurance".
Attorney General Biddle was referring there to a
company called Group Health who had physicians on its staff
and it agreed with its policyholders to provide hospital ser­
vices.
So this is nothing new, Your Honor, just as you said,
but the pharmacy arrangement portion of it is relatively new.
It became effective in 1969«,

Tripartite arrangements though

have been around since the early 1930s.
Your Honor, as we believe that under th© plain meaning
of the statute, the statutory construction in this court's
two prior decisions, that clearly Pharmacy Agreements come
within the business of insurance.
QUESTIONS Does last term's

St, Paul

case, have any

1?
bearing or* this?
MR, KAISER*

Your Honor, the St, Paul versus Barry

case dealt with the 3(b) portion of the statute, the boycott
exception,
QUESTION*

So it really does not have any bearing,

does it — any direct bearing?
MR. KAISER*

It has no direct bearing, but it hae

some bearing that X think is very beneficial end that this
Court ©aid in St. Paul versus Barry

that there is no indication

in the legislative history of the Act that Congress intended
to define the business of insurance in a manner Inconsistent
with its ordinary meaning or customary understanding, that being
the state of the industry at the time of the Act's passage.
And as I just related, the state of the industry at
the time of the .Act's passage.

And as I just related, the

state of the industry at the time of the Act's passage was. that
tripartite health service benefit arrangements were flourishing.
They were well known to the public? they were known to Congress
and in fact brought to Congress3 attention by Attorney General
Biddle.
With respect to the meaning of the statute, we see

“business o£ insurance" and “every
There is no indication in the statute

that Congress intended to limit the meaning

of the term

"business of insurance” even though during the Senate/House

18
debates in the Subcommittee meeting there were numerous sug­
gestions that the McCarr&n-Ferguson Act be limited severely.
QUESTIONS

I have a question about the words "every

person engaged therein'5»

Is it your position that those words

grant an exemption to the pharmacies?
MR. KAISER8

No, Your Honorr we are not saying that

the pharmacies are exempt.

Xt is our position that the Pharmacy

Agreement constitutes a petrt of the business of insurance and
is exempti therefore# both signatories to that agreement must
be exempt or we eviscerate the purpose of the Act.
QUESTIONi

Does that mean that if the pharmacies

hold a trade association or similar meeting and say we would
like to increase by 15 percent the price of drugs on our
schedule under these Blue Shield policies, that that meeting
would be exempt and they implement it by then going around to
the insurance companies and say we want 15 pereant more and
you renegotiate the agreement with the group as a whole and
come out with a higher drug price.

Is that exempt or is it

not?
MR. KAISERs

As I understand your question, if there

was collaboration among the pharmacies and than they went —
QUESTION s

If there are parsons engaged in the business

of insurance is my question. You are saying they are not persons
engaged in the business of insurance though.
MR. KAISER:

We are saying that the Pharmacy Agreement

the purpose of the Act,- both signatories to the Agreement must
be exempt,
QUESTION?

Well then* are the .signatories exempt

insofar as they collaborate with one another in dabs mining how
to negotiate with Blue Shield about the price schedule?
. MR. KAISER?

Your Honor, it would be our position

that if the signatories collaborated among themselves, went to
the insurer and said we want a 25 percent increase in the
dispensing fee which you are prepared -to offer ~~
QUESTION?

The pharmacist

We pay him a dispensing fee,

plus the acquisition cost of the drug.

That is the formula

on which he is reimbursed.
However, back to your question, Your Honor, if the
pharmacist went to Blue Shield and said we want to readjust
the formula and we want more money, and if that was ultimately
agreed upon and. incorporated into the Pharmacy Agreement, which
is a part of the business of insurance and therefore exempt,
we do not believe that that would be an actionable collaboration
between the pharmacists

No,

The reason it is beside the point

is because the exemption, if it applies, would cover the conduct

illegal in this —

And you mentioned it would be set in a

between Blue Shield and the drug companies, rather than com­

So that soma think that maybe

MR. KAISER:

X think that is right, Your Honor,

But

MR. KAISERs

No, Your Honor.

It is our positioa that the "business of insurance”
with respect to a provider agreement encompasses only those
provisions which directly relate to the delivery of the goods
and services underwritten in the contract and only those
provisions which directly relate to the cast of those goods
and services delivered to the insured*

As 1 said earlier, an insurance company might put
a number of- non-cost related items into any of its contracts,
whether they were —

MR. KAISSRs

of the exemption of the ^business of insurance15 under the
situation that we have here.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Kaiser, your time may be running a bit

26
short.

I am interested in knowing precisely what the Insurance

Commission of Texas did with respect to these agreements.

1

understood that initially it exempted them from approval; but
thereafter regarded tha agreement as subject to all other
laws applicable to the insurance business in Texas.
MR. KAISER*

Your Honor; initially tha State Board

o£ Insurance in Texas absolutely disapproved tha issuance and
the use of the policy.

Then it issued an order to prevent a competitive
disadvantage with a foreign insurance carrier who was carrying
on the same business in. Texas , and permitted — authorised
Blue Shield to issue and use this policy in the. State of Texas,
specifically referring to the Pharmacy Agreement, and the fact,
that Blue Shield would enter into participating providers to
provide dispensed drugs to the policyholders under the forms
of the contract.
Later on in 1&74, another policy form was submitted
to the State Board of Insurance identical in content to the one
that was submitted in 1969, and the State Board unequivocally
approved that policy for issuance and use in the State.
Now with respect to your question

or the inference

of exemption, Your Honor, from the Texas antitrust law there
is a provision in the approval statutes of Texas and we do
require that all new policy forms be filed for approval prior
to issuance or use

27
But if the Commissioner of Insurance determines that
a policy should ha — for reasons that are totally discretionary
with him and within his regulatory capacity, if the Commissioner
determines that a policy saay be issued or should be issued and
used within the State, them he may exempt that policy only
from the approval requirement, a very limited exemption.
Thereafter, the policy is subject to all of the
regulatory authority, all of the regulatory statutes and other
provisions within the State of Texas.

So there was no exemption

from regulation.
QUESTION:

Well, X understood you to say initially

that the policy had been approved, and now you say that it was
exempted, and 2 so understood the opinion of the Court of Appeals
to oay •— and I have it before me «— that in September 1989 the
Texas Commission of Insurance issued another written order
exempting the policy from the approval requirement of the Texas
Code.
MR. KAISERS

QUESTION?
MR. KAISERs

Yea, sir.

Is that correct?
Yes, sir, that is exactly correct.

We

are talking about two separate policies that were submitted to
fcha State Board of Insurance.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but what is the current status?

MR. KAISER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL B. PULLEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PULLEN*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court s
First of all, I would like to set this case in the
proper path.

We do not here have a policy of insurance which

in any way mentions the pries fixing aspects about which we
complain.■
All the policy provides with respect to who is a
participating pharmacist is that he is someone who has agreed
to furnish covered drugs to Blue Shield's Insured.

There is

nothing said about the agreement with the pharmacy beyond that
language.

And this is the policy that was exempted and this

is the policy that was subsequently approved.
At nowhere in the process, however, was the Bharr&cy
Agreement considered or approved or anything dene to it, other
than the fact that it was mailed to Austin to the State Board
of Insurance.

They took it and they did not send it back.

When, we took depositions of the people at the State
Board, I asked the® specifically, "Bo you claim any jurisdiction
over pharmacies?5’

Thsir answer was no.

I said, "Do you

regulate this Pharmacy Agreement in any manner?"
no.

And they said

And I said, "Why not?5’ And they said, "Because it is not

part of the business of insurance in Texas." .
So we have today presented to the Court a question
•which is basically not

the situation that the McCarran Act

was designed to reach.
QUESTIONS

Is that the testimony referred to on page

28 of your brief?
MR. PULLEMs
QUESTION %

I believe that it is, Your Honor.
Where does he say it is not part of

insurance?
MR. PULLEM %

I asked?

"Questions

So that the

record will be clear, is it your understanding that the State
Board, of Insurance under the regulatory authority granted it
under the Texas Insurance Code has authority to regulate con­
tracts between a company such as Blue Shield and an' independent
Pharmacy?n
"Answer*

My personal opinion is that this particular

contract that you showed me" — then I said, "You are talking
about Deposition Exhibit 6, the Pharmacy Agreement?"
"Right.

he said

Would be a contract between an entity and a provider

which would not be part of the original or full contract of
insurance.

The contract would be filed with us for informa­

tional purposes which ttfould be part of a plan for operations,
but when we get an entire plan of operations in, there are
certain aspects of it that we file, such as the Pharmacy
Agreement, certain aspects of it that we approve."
QUESTIONi

I am reading that, but why did the

Commission report to approve a contract in 1974?
MR. PULLEN;

I believe if you will look at the

contract, Your Honor, we covered this in our brief.

The contrac

It does not say anything aboutthe price fixing

It provides for approval

And the policy form here which the State has

permitted to be used does not include the price fixing aspect
of the Pharmacy Agreement.
If all we had here was an agreement that was con­
sistent with the policy, we would not be here because the
issue would not have corns up because all they would have asked
the pharmacy, "Will you furnish covered drugs to our insured?”
Well, obviously, they will.
What is bad about it is it goes beyond the policy
terms.

And they knei*/ it.

In fact —

32
QUESTIONS

What if the State had chosen to regulate

this contrary to your contention?

Would you say that you

.should lose your case?
MR» PULLENs

No, Your Honor»

I still think that that

would, be a situation where this court could determine under the
MeCar.ran Act which is a Federal statute what for McCarr&n Act
purposes under Federal law constitutes the "business of
insurance",
QUESTIONS

But you say even if it constitutes the

"business of insurance", if the State is not regulating it,
then

and who was this person that you had on the witness

stand that you were asking these legal questions to?
MR. PULLENs

That was Mr. Pogue who was, I believe,

the Assistant Manager of the Department of Policy Regulation.
QUESTION?

Was he a lawyer?

MR. PULLENs

No, Your Honor, but he is the man who

regulates the policy.

He is the man who actually determines

what policies are approved and which are disapproved.
QUESTIONS

Was that deposition or that testimony

given prior to the 1974 approval of this policy?
MR, PULLEN:

No, Your Honor.'

It was given after the

approval.
QUESTION:

How did he reconcile that action of the

Commission if indeed the Commission did act that way with his
testimony?

33

MR. PULLEN:

Well, the Commission only approves

It does not approve or disapprove the Pharmacy

Agreement.
QUESTION:

But I understood that the policy called

Pharmacy Agreement —
MR. PULLEN:
make myself clear.

No, Your Honor.

Apparently, I did not

The only agreement to which the policy

form refers is an agreement with the pharmacy that it will furnish
covered drugs.

It says nothing about the price at which they

will bs furnished.

And that is our argument.

QUESTION:

It does say something about the price at

which they will be furnished to the beneficiaries — the drugs
will be furnished to the beneficiaries.
MR. PULLEN:

Yes, in other wards

No, Your Honor.

And that is an important

The policy provides that if an insured

patronizes a participating pharmacist, which is defined as
someone who has agreed to furnish covered drugs, the policy”
holder pays the deductible- and Blue Shield pays the rest.
Now, that is not how it operates in practice.

But,

first of all, to stay on your question, Your Honor, if he
goes to a non-participating pharmacist who is defined, as some­
one who has not agreed to furnish covered drugs — that is
the only test?

price is not the thing — then the policyholder

still pays his $2.00 but it is clone in a different manner.
He pays the cost to the pharmacist.
to Blue Shield.

He then sends his claim

Blue Shield then deducts the $2.00 deductible,

but penalizes the pharmacy, and only reimburses him 75 percent
of a reasonable charge as determined by Blue Shield.
QUESTIONi
MR. PULLEMs

You say it penalises the pharmacy?
Yes, sir.

Well, it penalizes the insured

who in turn learned very quickly that he had better go to a
Blue Shield pharmacy who signed this agreement.
I think it is extremely significant in this case that
in 1975 when we took the depositions in October, over 98
percent of the 31,000 claims a month which were filled in Texas
under this type of coverage went to participating pharmacists.
And I think the significance of that is it shows the

35
coercive effect; it certainly shows a boycott.

And I think

the question that was raised earlier;Does the boycott exception
have anything to do with this case?

I think it does very

strongly because what this Court —
QUESTION;

How does it show a boycott?

I do not

understand that.
MR. PULLENs

Because, Your Honor, the effect of the

policy is to allocate the business of Blue Shield's insureds
to those pharmacies who have agreed to fix prices with Blue
Shields.
QUESTION;

Who agreed to accept the price Blue Shield

is willing to pay is what you are saying, which has to be a
lower price than, the others want for their drugs.

I do not

understand that to be a boycott.
Anybody can get in that participation, can they not?
MR. PULLEN;
problem.

Yes, Your Honor, but that is not the

The problem is if you do not gat in, if you try and

have a free market transaction with your customer, Blue Shield
then exerts this effort on his customer.
QUESTION;

Well, we are talking now about the merits

I suppose than about the "business of insurance"?
ME, PULLEN;

Well, we are talking about the boycott

provision of the exemption, Your Honor, which I say is a matter
that this Court should consider.
QUESTION;

Would a retail drugstore have an action.

36

against the Bank of America because the Bankamericard kind of
coerces people to go to drugstores that will accept the
Bankamericard and even take five percent off their gross as
a result of it?
MR. PULLENs

I am not familiar with how the Bank­

americard works»
QUESTION %

Well, any kina of a credit card is going

to have a certain coercive effect.
MR. PULLEN:

I think that is true, Your Honor.

But

lat us look at this transaction — and I think it will be
very quickly demonstrated.
A pharmacist is in business to sell drugs and phar­
maceuticals.

A customers comes in? he has a prescription from

his doctor that the pharmacist wants to fill and the customer
wants filled.

The pharmacist fills that prescription.

gives him the bill for his normal charge part.

He

Blue Shield

says that we have some particular interest in that transaction,
even though it is

a

transaction in the ordinary course of the

pharmacy business which occurs everyday.
They say you are dealing with our insured.

And

apparently their feeling is that they have some sort of vested
interest in that insured, and that, therefore, they can determine
at what price the pharmacy will sell the drug to his customer.
And I do not think the Court should be misled that
this case and the Court's decision is going to be limited to

37
pharmacists.

If this action is the “business of insurance**, it

is going to foe the business of insurance or similar actions
in every aspect of our society where insurance is written.
Home fire insurance companies can have participating construction
agreements; automobile ~
QUESTION s

Getting back to the drugs, what other

interest, does Blue Shield have other than to get for its
customers the lowest priced drugs they can get?
MR. POLLENs

I do not know that that is their

interest, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Well, give me what other- interests they

have .
MR. PULLEMs

I think their interest basically is to

increase the amount of money which they will retain out of
the transaction.
QUESTIONS

hnd in the meantime they get drugs cheaper'?

MR. PULLEN:
a crime at all.

And that is & crime?

Mo# Your Honor# I do not say that is

What I say is that it takes the transaction

out of the competitive process and it allows the insurance
company# rather than the free market price# which this Court
has been very eager to protect and rightfully so — it takes
that transaction out of the marketplace transaction.
Now# following along — and this was the question
that in ray analysis of this case X became concerned about this —
I saids

Is the insurance company — let us reverse it.

Are

they debating# so to speak# a target for whatever the druggists
want to charge?

Well clearly not.

-They have a way to protect

themselves and they oar. protect themselves within what has
traditionally been recognised as the insurance relationship in
their contract with their insured.
QUESTION z

Is not there a factor of the predictability

of prices that goes into the actuarial activities of the
insurance company as volunteer?
MR. PULLENs
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor.
They must know reasonably what the exposure

39
of risk amounts to?
MR. PULLSN:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree with that.

If they are at the mercy of anyone who

wants to charge a higher price, they cannot predict the prices,
can they?
MR. PULLENs

No, they cannot predict the price, but

they can by specifying in their contract what they are going
to pay? predict their exposure on which their premium was
based.

And they could do it much better if they did it that

way because in that manner they could also cover the cost
of drugs.
We have cited statistics which show that drug costs —
and all we get from Blue Shield is our acquisition

cost of the

drug — we have shown statistics that those costs have gene
up 59 percent.

Yet the pharmacists' total cost for furnishing

service is only up 28 percent.

If they were truly concerned

with maximum control, they would regulate the drug cost.
QUESTION:

But the participating druggists manage

to accommodate themselves to the economics, do they not?
MR. PULLEN:

That is the question, Your Honor.

Many

tell me they cannot continue to function and furnish competition
and services.
QUESTION?

Well, is there anything in the record,

here that would indicate that?
MR. PULLEN ,i

In some of the deposition testimony of

40
some of the plaintiffs in ray caso,. I believe you will find that,
your Honor, because there was inquiry about what is wrong with
what you are getting and they say it is too low.

There is

also a letter in the record that says the price is too low.
QUESTIONs

On ybur approach to this thing, although

it is obviously not involved in this case, if you carried it
to its logical conclusion, you would undermine the whole
cooperative movement in the United States, would you net?
MR. PULLEN %
QUESTIONS

X do not think so. Your Honor.
Part of it is bargain for the lowest prices

and limit the areas of their purchase, do they not?
MR. PULLEN:

Yes, Your Honor, but I think here we

are looking at something to determine not the cooperative
movement, but the business of insurance.
QUESTION:

Well, they have coupled the cooperative

concept with the business of insurance here.

the interpretation of the insurer as to the scope of that
policy and the meaning of the language of the policy, did they
not?
MR. PULLEN:

Your Honor, my reading of Mr. Pogue's

testimony was that this came in? they did put it in the file,
although they did not stamp it "filed®, but it was just a
matter which they received for informational purposes.
As I read his testimony it is — even though I may
read this and examine it, I have no jurisdiction over it.

And

that, 1 believe, is what he said as the record will reflect.
QUESTION3

Well, is this a question which was ultimately

decided by the Supreme Court of Tessas?
MR. PULLEN:

sition very much so.

look at the State statute.

I think you have to

And when you look at the Texas

State statute, when it talks about what will be filed, it is
insurance policy fonts.

And this is the point I tried to make

when I first opened ny argument, that that is all the statute
provides Texas has regulatory authority over.

There is nothing

in the Texas statute and there is nothing that has-been cited
to this Court that show:.; any authority of the State to approve
the Pharmacy Agreement.
QUESTION;
MR. PULLEN:

/

Then you do not need the depositions?
No, sir. • I think it helps considerably

because he is the man who is enforcing the Texas law and this
is how it does operate»
1 would point out to the Court in answer to Justice
Marshall's question before lunch about whether prices would
increase»
1969«

The pharmacy dispensing fee of $2»00 was fixed in

There were no studies at that time to determine whether

that was adequate.

There have been no studies since to deter/

mine whether it is adequate.
Our position is that wo wish to compete? we wish to
have our prices set subject to the competitive forces.

They

may increase if this agreement is held subject to the antitrust
laws, our competition may keep them from increasing, but. it
would be the competitive factor in our society which would
determine that.
I would like to also spend a little time talking
about the type of policy we have here.

Despite fch® terms

that counsel for Blue Shield has used, it is purely and simply
an indemnity type of policy»
/

Page 255a in the Appendix which is the Michigan
contract, they say Blue Shield is not a party to this drug
sale.

The Walgreen contract in Texas which is at 203 of the

Appendix says Blue Shield is the underwriter of insurance
protection only.
On page 182a of the Appendix which is a form latter
for Blue Shield it talks about how they will make payments.

And

45
that basically is what we have here.
The compensation to the pharmacy is fixed at one
level for all pharmacies.

The net result of this — and

particularly since it stayed the same since 1969 except — and
this is not in the record — I think it did go up to 2.25
after the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

It is our position that

this eliminates competition in 'the retail sales of drugs and
pharmaceuticals, not only price competition but service com­
petition .
Our clients say that we cannot operata and compete
fully.

We cannot compete in the area of services? we cannot

compete in the area of hours, and that this is also a sig­
nificant factor.

But it also shows in my opinion that the

transaction in question is purely and simply a business trans­
action between a pharmacist and his customer.
Blue Shield goes further and says that customer
happens to be an Insured of ours.

,

So, therefore, Mr. Pharmacist

wa can tell you what to charge him and wo can make it stick
and they cannot, and they have.
They have entered into a conspiracy.

wants to get the maximum reimbursement he has to go where the

QUESTION*

with that in your view in antitrust terms?

Your Honor, in my opinion, that is a

The

figures show — Blue Shield's own figures show that 38 percent
of their customer's business goes to the participating pharma­

cist»

That is not anything that you have

QUESTIONS

with the merits of the antitrust claim, but merely whether or
not the defendant is under the statutory exemption, and to
be under the statutory exemptions the defendants have to be
first in the business of insurance and, second, not regulated

Assuming you are right

that these provider agreements are not regulated by the State,

MR. PULLEN:
QUESTION :

That is my understanding, Your Honor.
So that even if you might consider for

purposes of the McCarran-Pergusen Act these provider agreements
to be within the contemplation of the words "insurance business";,
the Sherman Act would nevertheless apply in Texas if Texas
did not regulate those agreements?
MR. POLLEN %
QUESTION £

That would be certainly my understanding.
But it does not have to regulate them

under its Insurance Commissioner.

It can regulate them through

its antitrust laws or any other way. But it does not purport,
to regulate them at all, I gather.
HR. PULLENS
QUESTION:

Sir —
I wonder if Mr. Justice Stewart is right

because Section B says it will supersede any law enacted by
any state for the purpose of regulating the business of
insurance.

1 do not think that language covers state antitrust

laws, does it?

49
MR* PULLENs
Your Honor*

I have had some question about it,

In looking at the MeCarran Act legislative history,

the court in my opinion was talking about affirmative acts of
state regulation because they talked about agreements which
the public authority has approved.
On this point, Mr. Kaiser

mentioned the Texas

Article XXI of the Unfair Labor Practices, we have shown in our
'brief and cited a Texas case that that would not apply to us
because we have no insurance policy.
someone who has.

We are just selling to

And I do not think that that would apply

to us.
Obviously, Blue Shield if they are going to be in
court would rather be under the Texas Antitrust Act.

And we

do have one and theta is no question about it, but it has not
been one that has bean used for damage suits, and it is
considerably less severe in the recovery to a plaintiff.
I have soma question about whether an antitrust
statute, which would apply on an after the fact basis and
perhaps never be invoked by a private plaintiff, is the type
of regulation that the McCarran Act -QUESTIONs

Well, the question is not whether it is

applied after the fact.

The question is whether it is a law

enacted by the state for the purpose ©f regulating the "business
of insurance13.
MR. PULLEN2

As compared to just regulation of

50
business in general.
QUESTION s
MR. PULLENS
QUESTIONs

Yes.
Yes# sir.
Well# Section 2(b) has no such limiting

language# and 1 thought that was the exempfciva section that
was in issue of this case.
MR. PULLEN s

I have been quoting from Section 2(b).

To continue# lour Honor# the matter is not one-sided.
If contracts for the sale of merchandise — the people who
have insurance coverage — do broadly constitute the-business
of insurance# the situation may turn to a horrible type of
thing.

Bor example# if on® of these contracts automatically

la within the. business of insurance and exempts any. trust
violations# could the pharmacist get together with the small
insurance company# acquire control over it and then say to
Blue Shield# "Well# we are sorry# gentlemen# we are dealing
with this insurance company and we are not going to deal with
you.

And we do not have a boycott because there are other

people and they may deal with you# but we are going to service
only the customers of this other insurance company# and we
are not going to give any service to your insureds and we are
not going to reimburse our insureds for dealing with other
people,"
I believe my time has expired.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OS RICHARD A. ALLENDP ESQ.
AMICUS CURIAE
MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court:
The issue in this case is whether Blue Shield's
agreements with various pharmacies constitute the "business
of insurance* within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the
KcCarranHBerguson Act.

The issue does not concern the

merits of Respondents8 antitrust allegations.
There has been no ruling on

the merits of the anti­

trust issues and there have been no facts developed with

respect to it, but X would stress — simply stress at the
outset the point that Mr. Justice Stevens made which was
that the consequence of petitioner’s position would be that
even if the facts showed a conspiracy between a group of
pharmacies to fix the price of prescription drugs and -the use
of a Pharmacy Agreement with an insurance company to implement
that conspiracy, the consequence of petitioner’s position would
be that it would be the business of insurance and, therefore,
exempt from antitrust laws.
But the issue presented —
QUESTIONs
this.

Mr. Allen, I just want to foe sure about

I know I put that example forward.

But is that true

if the State of Texas has not specifically approved that
particular arrangement?

52
In other words, doss not the exemption only come into
play as part of 2(b) which says no hot of Congress shall in­
validate the State law for the purpose of regulating

insurance,

and unless you have State approval, you do not have the State
law?
MR. ALLENs

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, there are

two portions of Section 2(b) which may be a source of some
of your confusion, but under either portion if an activity
is not the business of insurance, it makes no difference whether
the state law regulates it or does not.

Our position is that

the Pharmacy Agreements are not the business of insurance.
QUESTIONs

Well, let me fos sure that I get my con­

fusion cleared up because I am confused.

What part of 2(b)

would grant an exemption if you had no state regulation?

you

just told me that there were two parts to 2(b), one of which
was -MR. ALLEN;

Excuse me.

No part to 2(b) would grant

an exemption from the antitrust laws if there was no state
regulation.

Does that answer your question?

QUESTION;

Right.

So that then in my hypothetical

there is no exception unless there is state regulation which
authorised that particular arrangement?
MR. ALLEN;

That is true, even if the activity is not

the business of insurance.
QUESTION;

State regulation does not have to authorise

53
it.

It just has to be state regulation.
MR. ALLEN;
QUESTION ;

That is correct.
It is tli© language to which my brother

Stevens adverted in Section 2(b) -- at least as I understood
as referring to non-preemption prior to June 30th, 1948, and the
general exemptive language I thought was in -the latter part
of 2(b).
MR. ALLEN%
QUESTIONs
MR. ALLENs
QUESTIONS

That was my understanding.
After June 30, 1948.
That is mv understanding too.
Is it not true that all the state lav?

would have to do is purport to regulate provider agreements?
/ou would not have to have a specific action of the state
authorities on a specific provider agreement.
MR. ALLEN:

That is my understanding; Mr. Justice

White.
QUESTION:

And even if a provider agreement was in

violation of state law, you would have to leave the policing
Uj> to tlie state authorities not to the antitrust laws.
MR. ALLEN:

If the provider agreements were part of

the business of insurance.
QUESTIONs
MR. ALLEN;

But if they were not, of course —

/es, I understand that.
The issue presented by petitioner’s

motion to dismiss in the issue before this Court is simply
whether the Pharmacy Agreements are part of 'the business of

54
insurance„
QUESTION:

I hate to talcs up all your time on my

confusion but I think it is important that X understand the
statute»

So I am going to ask you one more question.
What is the language in the McCarran Act which grants

the exemption?
MR. ALLENg

Section 2(b).

QUESTION:

Read me the words that you talk about*

MR, ALLEN:

The pertinent portion, I think# is

'•’provided that after June 30# 1948 the Act of July 1890# known
as the Sherman Act and the Act known as the Clayton Act and the
Act known as the eederal Trade Commission Act shall be applicable
to the business of insurance to the extent that such business
is not regulated by state law.*-’
QUESTION:

And does it anywhere say — and you say

by reversa implication?
MR. ALLEN:

By reverse implication that would suggest

that if it were regulated by state law# those particular
acts would not apply,'
The main provision of Section 2(b) provides “no Act
of Congress shall" »—
QUESTION:

I understand that*

In. other words# it is the reverse implication of the
proviso is the sole source of the exemption?
MR. ALLENs

That is my understanding# although of

55
course under our position it would not make any difference
because under our position it is not the business of insurance»
QUESTIONs

Well# the words "business of insurance"

are found in -that Section 2?
MR. ALLEN;
QUESTION;

That is correct.
All right.

I am sorry to have taken

your time»
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That is quite all right.
Well# I would suppose the first part of

2(b) would satisfy any state law that was in conflict with
the antitrust law?
MR. ALLEN:

The first part of 2(b) provides -that

nc Act of Congress shall be construed to supersede# according
to memory# any state law enacted for the purpose of regulating
insurance„
QUESTION;

That is right and including antitrust

lews.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Including the antitrust laws.
So this Act would not apply if it served

to supersede a state law?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So the first part of 2(b) would give

insurance business exemption from the antitrust laws if -—
MR. ALLEN:

That is correct# Mr. Justice White.

first part of Section 2(b) would —

The

55
QUESTION:

Well then, why do you say it is the

latter part, only the latter part?
MR. ALLEN:

Well, let raa modify ray position,,

not only the latter part.

It is

The latter part refers specifically

to the Sherman Act upon which the petitioners relied for their
antitrust complaint.

The first part would include the

Sherman Act.
QUESTIONS
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION ;

And every other federal law?
That is correct.
It also includes the Robinson-Patman

Act, the first part of 2Cb), which is not referred to in the
proviso.
MR. ALLEN;

That is correct.'

But the first part

would only limit the application of federal law to the extent
it happe?ied to supersede a state law designed for the purpose
of regislating the business of insurance, if I have made myself
clear.
In any event, we contend that the Pharmacy Agreements
are not part of the "business of insurance", and our argument
nay ba summarised as follows;
The precise scope of the business of insurance
exemption is not clearly delineated in the McCarran-Ferguson
Act., and there may be areas of reasonable doubt? although this
Court has frequently stated the principle that in areas of
reasonable doubt antitrust exemptions are to be narrowly

57
construed and antitrust application to be favored.
QUESTION:

That is implicit exemptions, is it not?

MR, ALLEN;

No, Mr, Justice Rehnquisfc, this Court

has applied that principle even in the case of expressed
exemptions.

The two cases, for example, that we cited in

our brief,- Abbo 11 Labor a to ri e a and federal Maritime Commission
versus Sea.train were eases of express exemptions from the
antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

Dc you think that one applies the

principle of narrow construction equally to express exemptions
as to implied exemptions?
MR, ALLEN:

fes, I do, four Honor.

When you are

dealing with an express exemption such as th® McCartan-ir ergueon
'1

Act or the many other express exemptions, the principle applies
to that exemption as to be narrowly construed.
In any event, what the legislative history of the
McCarran Act does indicate, as this Court has held in SEC versus
variable Annuity Company, and SEC versus National Securities is
first that Congress* core concern with respect to the "business
of insurance" was the underwriting risk, and the relationships •
between insurance companies and policyholders that concern the
underwriting of risk.
And the second thing the legislative history indicates
is that Congress did not intend to exempt everything an
insurance company does

50
Those two facts support our contention that the
Pharmacy Agreements are not the business of insurance.

lirst,

the Pharmacy Agreements are not the underwriting of risk.

They

are simply contz-acts for the purchase drugs and drug di&“
tribufcion services by Blue Shield.
QUESTION:

What is your response to what was suggested

this morning on the universal practice of public liability
insurance, insuring not only against the risk of the ultimate
judgment against the policyholder but the cost, of litigation?
MR. ALLEN:

My response is that that example is a

good illustration of our point.

We think it would be absurd

to contend that an agreement between an insurance company and
a law firm concerning the supplying of legal services to the
insurance company is the "business of insurance" in any
ordinary sense.
QUESTION?

How about if it is in the policy itself?

MR. ALLEN?

Even if it is in the policy itself, it

is simply common ordinary understanding to say that an agreement
between an insurance company and a law firm — how much the
ara going to pay par hour is the "business of insurance".
QUESTIONS

Is it not also true that medicine is

part of health?
MR. ALLEN:

That is true too, four Honor, and our

argument would follow.
QUESTION?

Well, is the paying of the doctor's bill

59
insurance?
MR* ALLEN:

The paying of the claims to the insurer

to the policyholder is the "business of insurance".

An agree­

ment between the insurance company and somebody who provides
services is we contend not the "business of insurance"*
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Including the doctors?
Including the doctors.

There is no

difference between pharmacies and doctors.
QUESTION:
not be covered.

Then under the Group Health plan it would

It would not be .insurance, would it, because

they pay the doctors.
MR. ALLEN;

I am not certain I understand your

point, Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTIONs

They pay the doctors.

The Group Health

hires the doctors.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION;

That is true.
So that would not be insurance then,

would it?
MR. ALLEN;

The hiring of the doctors would not t-i

the "business of insurance".
.QUESTION;
MR. ALLEN:

It would not be covered by this?
It would not be part of the "business

It may be perfectly lawful.

There is no

reason to suppose it is not lawful, but it would not be part
of the "business of insurance".

60
QUESTIONs

What if, forgetting any problems of

legal ethics —■ what if an insurance company just had a stable
of lawyers, its employees that it furnished under its insurance
contracts to beneficiaries who were sued for liability, would
those contracts with the lawyers be 'the "business of insurance"?
MR. ALLEN:

I think not, Mr, Justice Stewart,

It

is hard to see how those contracts would violate the antitrust
laws, but the relationship between — although the question
is net so clear.
QUESTIONS

If

not clear, then why is it clear

if the insurance company does the same thing with independent
contractors that it all of a sudden becomes very clear?
MR. ALLEN:

Well, there seams to me a basis for

distinction between one's dealings with one's own employees
and one's dealing ~~
QUESTION:

In this case the insurer is furnishing

the fservices and what difference is it, bo far as this exemption
goes, whether it does so through its employees or through
independent contractors?
MR. ALLEN:

As I say, my first response would be

that I do not think labor relation agreements between an
insurance company and doctors ~
QUESTION:

Those are not labor relation agreements,

but they are employment contracts.
them a. fancy name

There is no point in giving

61
MR. ALLEN;

Between an insurance company and its

doctors my first reaction was I do not think that would be
the "business of insurance's although 1 think the question
there would be closer because 2 think there is a basis for
distinction.
But the point we wish to emphasise is that at some
point we have to draw the line.

Insurance companies have

myriad relationships with third parties, what you would call
independent contractors, to furnish the insurance company with
goods and services.

They contract with printers; they contract,

with lawyers; they contract with building owners.
There is no suggestion in the legislative history
the Act of Congress intended all of those kinds of relation­
ships tc be "business of insurance".
QUESTION;

fou do not seriously contend that the

promise to defend a person in the case of an accident is not
insurance?
MR. ALLEN;
QUESTION:

No.

The promise is insurance.

I would not think that, you would think

that if there has been an accident and the company is called
upon to furnish the legal services that were promised, you
would not think furnishing the legal services was not insurance?
MR. ALLENs
QUESTION;

No, 1 agree that that would be insurance.
And if they are going to furnish the

legal services, they are going to have to pay for them?

62
MR. ALLEN*
QUESTION*

That is correct, but oaly in the same —If the insurance company goes out to an

independent law firm and hires them to furnish the services
that were promised, the furnishing of those services is part
of the insurance business?
MRo ALLEN*

The furnishing of the services to the

policyholders* that is right.
QUESTION*

But you would not think that the negotiations

of price at which they ware furnished was part of the insurance?
MR. ALLEN*

The negotiation between the insurance

company and the lawyer we would contend is not the "business
of insurance" because there is no principal basis for dis­
tinguishing that kind of agreement between the insurance
company —
QUESTION*

Well, why do you not draw the line and

say, well, perhaps that piecemeal negotiation is one thing,
but a forward contract, a sort of supply contract in the
indefinite future?
MR. ALLEN:

Because any distinction on that basis

would break down.
QUESTIONi

Any distinction breaks down.

What about

the contrast to purchase the paper on which the policy is
'written, now is that part of "business of insurance”?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION*

The contrast to purchase the paper?
On which the policy is written.

S3
MR. ALLEN:

We would contend, it would not be and

that a conspiracy between printers to fix the price of printing
services, which use an agreement with an insurance company
to implement that conspiracy, is not what Congress intended
to exempt from the antitrust law.
QUESTIONS

Well, the insurance company could be

a plaintiff in am antitrust lawsuit against a paper manufacturer
who agree to fix the prices»
MR. ALLEN?
QUESTIONs

Exactly.
It could be a plaintiff here against

any pharmacists who agreed among themselves to fix the prices.
MR. ALLEN;

Under our contention, but not under the

petitioners5 contention.
QUESTION;

No, no.

But th© point is that now wa

have am agreement with them,between the insurance company and
the pharmacists to provide services.

And the question is

whether or not that is the "business of insurance"?
MR. ALLEN:

And our response is that it is not because

if it were, then everything an insurance company would do to
save its own cost of services would be the "business of
insurance".
QUESTION;
MR. ALLEN:

Well, perhaps that is th© answer,
Congress did not so intend.

It is

clear from -this Court's decision.
QUESTION;

2 understood Mr. Kaiser this morning

64
when X put 'the question to him to say that the action of the
drug people together, independent of the agreement with Blue
Shieldf could be an antitrust violations, and one of the ways
that could be asserted would be for Blue Shield to sue them
because they were pushing the price up,
MR. ALLEN;

That is correct, Mr. Chief,Justice, but

the distinction is important.
that is perfectly true.

H© makes that concession and

We agree with that, but what his

position necessarily entails is that if that conspiracy between
th© pharmacists ware embodied in an agreement with an insurance
company, that would b© the — that agreement would make it
all part of th© "business of insurance”.
QUESTIONS
not render them.

No.

His response to that was that would

It might be part of the ^business of

insurance” as between Blue Shield and the druggists, but it
would not render the druggists lammed from an antitrust
violation for their own agreement.
MR. ALLEN;

Wall, I do not understand that to b©

their position, four Honor.

I did not hear him say that this

morning.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

I understood it very clearly.
But if that is his position, what he is

saying is that then we can violate th© antitrust laws by
entering into an agreement with pharmacists and then th©
pharmacists —

S5
QUESTION?

Welly that is exactly what an, exemption

means, that you can engage in conduct which would be violating
the antitrust laws if you did not have an exemption.

That

is exactly what an exemption means.
MHo ALLENs

But what this Court has established

is that the MoCarran-t erguson Set did not intend it to immunise
entities.

It intended to immunise conduct, agreements,

practices.
QUESTION:

Except at a business, the business of

insurance.
MR„ ALLENz

That is right, but it does not matter

who is engaging in it.

Mr. Chief Justice, if there was any

confusion with our discussion earlier toddy, it would be our

MR. KAISER;

It would be my initial impression right

now that if the agreement was embodied into the Pharmacy

QUESTION;

But Blue Shield is, at least in ordinary

human experience, not very likely to enter into conspiracies
to raise their own costs?

67
MR. KAISER:

Not at all, /our Honor, that would

be totally against our own interest and the interest of our
policyholders.
QUESTION:

So the hypothesis is, at least economically,

not very real.
MR. KAISER:

That is correct.
Unless they get together to keep Blue

Shield from going too low and Blue Shield gets paid off in

Well, it has been true, has it not, in

some pieces?

MR. KAISER:

Not to my knowledge.

I am not familiar

with anything of that nature that has ever happened.
QUESTION:

Does the price fixing agreement have to be

to fix maximum prises to be unlawful?

Supposing it is an

agreement to fix prices much lower than anybody else will

MR. KAISER:

There is considerable dispute about

that, but as I read the eases price fixing can either be to

It would be illegal either way, would

Strictly from an antitrust —
If you had a group of large druggists who

wanted to have a very■low price in order to drive small
companies oat of business* for example* and persuaded Blue
Shield to go along with it, then that would normally be an
antitrust violation?
MR. KAISER:

My thoughts are undor the theory that

Blue Shield would offer this agreement to everyone? some would
possibly be able to accept and some possibly could not.
QUESTION:

Is there any limitation now?

MR. KAISER:

Any lici&n&ad pharmacy in the State of

QUESTION:

Mr. Allen* to be' sure that my confusion

is completely cleared up, do you agree with the view that
in order.to qualify for the exemption under Section 2(b) of
the MoCarran Act, you must establish both that you are in
the "business ©f insurance", and secondly, that that which you
claim a© an exemption is regulated by state law?

Ho, sir.

They said that in view of the

fact that it was finding that th© Pharmacy Agreement did not
constitute th© “business of insurance", it was not required
to go to th© second step relating to stats regulation, nor was
it required to go to th© step relating to boycott.
The business of insurance is a federal question.
There seems to have been considerable discussion today about
the state's interest and whether or not th© state has regulated
and whether or not the state considered th© matter to be th©
“business of insurance”„
QUESTION:

Ifc is true that the exemption, however,

exists —- the exemption for the "business of insurance” exists
only to the extent that it is regulated by state law,

That is correct, four Honor,
And your opponent in Part 2, I think it

is, of his brief asserts that this is not regulated by state
law,
MR, KAISER:

I just wanted to make cur point clear.

We are not relying upon what th© state did to say that this
constitutes fell© "business of insurance",

We are relying strictly

70
upon a federal standard .

that the "business of insurance” has to foe regulated by state

Supposing you pay money and you go out

and borrow mousy from a bank to pay off a claim in dollars, is
that the "business of insurance"?
MR, KAISERs
QUESTION:

If the insured?
No, the company is a little short of cash.

So they go to the bank? they raise the cash to pay up a very
iorga claim of some catastrophe of some kind?
MR. KAISER:

four Honor, I do not believe that would

QUESTION:

Well, I believe that it would fall too

.far outside the relationship between the insurer and the insured,,
the assumption of risk in providing the benefit.

MR. KAISER:

This Court sot out some vary broad

criteria in determining what constitutes the "business of
insurance" in -that case, but the real nexus for what does
constitute the "business of insurance" are matters that
intimately relate to the insurer/insured relationship.
The Court also said that the type of policy which
could be issued, its reliability, interpretation and enforce»
meat and other activities of insurers, which relate closely
to their status ©s reliable insurers constitute the "business

of, insurance" for McCarran purposes.
QUESTION:

ion apply all that language to making a

big loan from a bank to pay off the policy obligation.
MR. KAISER:

four Honor, the preceding cas© in 195®

of Senuritiss and Exchange Commission versus Variable Annuity
said that the marger of two insurance companies, even though
the sale of stock or the holding of stock involved the insureds
to some respect, said that that was not sufficient.

That did

not sufficiently relate to the insurer/insured relationship.
And I think your proposition ©bout going out and
borrowing money would be more akin to the Variable Annuity case.
