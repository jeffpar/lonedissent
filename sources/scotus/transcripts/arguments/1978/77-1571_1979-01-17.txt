OPAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. GBERLY, III, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. OBERLYs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court s
The case that is presently before this Court for
consideration concerns a vary narrow question of whether polis®
officers will be permitted to stop motor vehicles for the sols ,
limited purpose to conduct a license end a registration check.
The facts of this particular case are not in dis­
pute.

On November 30th, 1976, an officer ©f New Castle County

Police Department stopped a motor vehicle in which the Raspon|'dent, Mr. Prouse , was an occupant,

The stop was motivated solely to check for a dri'{

There was no other wrongdoing or facts indicating suspicion at

the time the vehicle was stopped.

approaching the vehicle, the officer, -noticed

a smell of marijuana.

A subsequent search and arrest ensued in

which mairjuana was found in the car and ©n the parecrn of
Mr, Prouse.
At the trial court a motion was mad© to suppress

4
the evidence which was granted and the holding was then appealed
by the State of Delaware to the Delaware Supreme Court®
On January 30th, 1978«. the Delaware Supreme Court
Affirmed the trial court's ruling holding that random stops
without articulable facts should justify a reasonable suspicion
that there is evidence of wrongdoing are unconstitutional under
the Fourth and 14th Amendments.
The State of Delaware respectfully disagrees with
that holding and sought certiorari in this Court.
In so ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court specifi­
cally recognised that there was a legitimate state interest in
the enforcement of its motor vehicle laws.
Furthermoref the Delaware Supreme Court noted that
it was adopting what it called a rigid invalidity rule and the
state submits that such rigid rules have been qschewed by this
Court where they do exact a high toll on the public and where
they Car: frustrate legitimate law enforcement efforts®
It is the state's position, that the Delaware
'Suprema Court r ading of the 14th and-- 4th Amendment requirement
'of articulable suspicion erred in failing to apply the reasonableness test that has been used by this Court sine® Terry
and Brignonl-Force.
The reasonableness test to measure police conduct
has been applied on numerous instances and it caused the Court
to consider the interest ©f society measured against the

5
individual rights that were involved in a particular ease.
The: test that has been set out calls for the Court
to weigh the factors of the purpose and the degree of protection,
the public perception of th© stop or seizure that may be in­
volved in a particular case and the alternative methods or pro­
cedures that would be available to conduct the particular
search or stop in an alternative manner.
After

considering these factors * the expectation

of privacy of th© individual should fee considered and the intru­
siveness of that particular search.
It is the state8s sontonfeion that the Delaware
Supreme Court erred in failure to give full consideration t©
these factors, that had it don© so, that the interest of society
fl^buld clearly have indicated that such stops should' «have been
: permitted

Initially, the state would not© that there is a

When I walk out of this

courtroom, I will ba affected in ©©sends by the motor vehicle
laws of the District of Columbia.

"'V.

Th© ©afire way home will b© affected
The State of Delaware and other surrounding states
and jurisdictions have a paramount sonearn as to who can drive,

6
when you can drive* where you can drive* who has insurance and
who doss not have insurance and it is submitted that this is
®ore than just a minimal estate interest* that it is a substan­
tial state interest and I need not burden —
QUESTION:

Did the police officer ask if the driver

had insurance?
MR. OBERLY:

In this particular eas®* no* he did

not* Your Honor,,
QUESTIONs

He did not* I knew but would you say*

would the state have — would it be permissible for him to in­
quire of the driver on that subject on © random basis whan h@
stopped him?
MR. OBERLY:

Yes* Mr. Justice Stevens* in Delaware

a registration cannot be obtained — which is kept inside
the car — unions there is insurance.
registration that

St is stamped on your

it is valid so in order to even get th©

stamp * you have to have shown that you have insurance.
In the interim* if the insurance had expired during
that period of time the state would submit that you would be
■•’able to inquire because Delaware statute does require that
all vehicle drivers carry a certain minimal amount of insurance
for personal liability.
QUESTION:

Would he also have the right* I suppose*

to ask the man if he had had a drink within the last hour?
MR. OBERLY:

I do not believe that he would have

7
that right unless he had some articulable suspicion to pursue
it any further than that.

The state is asking for solely a

limited right simply to check whether or not the individual is
qualified to drive and whether or not that vehicle is properly
registered.
It is not asking that they be given permission to
go any further than that.
QUESTION:

I am having trouble with the word

"random."

Is that really the word or do they stop whoever they

have some

MR. OBERLY %
QUESTION:

Can yon stop anybody?
No, but —

2 thought this Court went to great de­

tail to explain what happened in Terry.

That policeman

watched Terry for about three or four hours, did he not?
MR. OBERLY:
QUESTION:

Yes, he didf Your Honor.
Well, does not random by definition

mean nothing more than the person is driving a motor vehicle on
the highway and that there is not any other ground for stopping
him?
MR. OBERLY:

That is the state's contention, yes,

sir, Mr. Justice Relinquist.
1 would indicate that in Terry the Court did state
that it was concerned with the possibility of harassment
against either racial minorities or other minorities and it was
contended in the ©pinion that it is virtually impossible and a
futile protest to lay down rigid invalidity rules that can

QUESTION:
MR. OBERLY:
QUESTION:

Yes, he did and that of course -Was this driver easing any place?
1 am sorry?
What was ha doing?

He was driving a

car and there is nothing illegal in that at all, is there?
MR. OBERLY%

That is correct.

He was doing

nothing more than driving a car at the point when he was stopped.
QUESTION:

There is nothing illegal in driving the

car if he has a license and if he has insurance.

10
MR. OBERLY:
QUESTIONs

That is correct.
And if h© does not have a license, them

it is illegal, is it not?
MR. OBERLY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

This is a threshold -

Your point is that Delaware claims the

right to stop any car to s©@ whether h@ has, number on©, the
license to drive it which implies carrying insurance and that
that driver has the title papers to the oar, I suppose9 to
cheek that?
MR. OBERLY3

Tha registration would necessarily

include that that car is properly titled and the name to whom
it is registered and that is all the state seeks is a threshold
determination of whether or not the occupant or the driver, I
am sorry, the driver of a particular vehicle is qualified and
fit to occupy a 4,000-pcund vehicle on our highways or in the
states.
QUESTION:

Does Delaware have safety inspection

laws?
MR. OBERLY s

Delaware has a yearly inspection of

the automobile at which time it is run through an inspection
point to test the brakes, safety and the registration is signed
and a fee is paid and a sticker is given the driver and it is
put on the license and a card indicating the ownership of the
vehicle is then stamped which indicates that the proper insur­
ance is ©e there.

11
QUESTION %

Wellf ycm do not stop him to s@@ if he

has a sticker?
MR. OBERLY:

No, the sticker is displayed on the

license plats.
QUESTION:

I should hope so.

QUESTION:

This is only yearly.

MR. OBERLY2
QUESTION:

That is only yearly, Your Honor.
Does Delaware have a policy of making

random stops?
MR. OBERLY:

There is no sat policy by any of the

police departments in Delaware that I am aware of that requires
any officers to conduct random stops.

Random stops are fre­

quently conduct rid, however and hav© been conducted by the police
department in the State of Delaware.
QUESTION:

Apart from a state policy is there any,

does the record show whether this particular officer was working
pursuant to any local policy or was it just his own initiative?
MR. 0BE1LY:

The record s© indicates it was his

bile or the vehicle in which Mr. Prousa was located in ha had
a lull in activity.

Be was not responding to any other crime

scenes and he saw the vehicle and he decided to stop it for the
license registration check but he was acting on his mm at that
time.
QUESTION%

Was the marijuana package in plain sight

12
or did he detect that first fro® the odor of the marijuana?
MR. OBBRLY %

As soon as he walked up to the car

h® never had the chance even t©

engage in the initial ques­

tioning before he smelled the marijuana.
Ka smelled the marijuana, walked back t© the patrol
car, called for radio assistance, since his stop was going to
be obviously longer than h© anticipated, went back to the car,
asked the driver and the passengers to exit the vehicle at
which time the marijuana was? seen in plain view and a subse­
quent arrest of Mr. Prouse and a frisk ©f him found the mari­
juana — additional marijuana on his person.

QUESTION t

1 did not think fch@ Issue here was

whether or not the state could do this.

The question was

whether having done it in th@ maimer it was d@n@ here, the
marijuana seised could b© used as ©videnc®

©gainst the driver.

Is that the issu©?
MR. OBERLY:

Well, I think it is a combination ©f

both.
QUESTION:

You may be denied that without being

denied any authority fe© stop and make a traffic cheek.
MR. OBERLY:

That is a possibility.

However, as

noted in the footnote ©£ the Delaware. Suprema Court Opinion,

in this ease was in plain view that actually, there was articulaoie suspicion -~

Of course you could, as Mr. Justice

cannot possibly enforce these unless we have that right.
QUESTION:

MR. OBErlYs

You can cancel their license,

You can

You may not be able to convict them.
Your Honor, it is tha state's fealiaf

that if w© sire not able t© stop absent articulable suspicion
and that the Delaware Suprema Court ruling is affirmed, tha
moaning of that would basically fee that any person without ©
driver’s license who has a suspended license, a revoked li­
cense or no insurance is being given notice that you may drive
upon the roads of the State of Delaware unless you axe unfor­
tunate enough to drive past the officer who previously arrested
you or you violate some other rule of the road and then we
submit that it is possibly too late at that point, that the
determination of who is fit and who is not fit is whether or
not you possess that license, not whether or not you violat®
& law and then you are found not to possess a license.

Does Delaware pursue the practice also

of setting up random check points at which the license of every

driver is checked?

exercise random stops only at certain periods of time and
certain localities pursuant to concerted plans or

whereas police officers may be driving around doing their

they have times when they really do not have anything els© to
do.

It would require a greater effort additionally in addition

to the amount of inconvenience it causes every driver.
1 co not believe it necessarily is required.

Th©

application of the exclusionary rule to a ease in which there
has been no evidence whatsoever presented by the Respondent ©£

laid down the rule to guide in these particular-type cases.
Lastly,, it would be the state's contention that we
would respectfully request that this Court apply the use of the
word "reasonableness™ in interpreting what the Fourth Amendment
requires in weighing the society’s interest, loss of life, the
property damage of who is fit to drive and who can be insured
and weigh that against the minimal inconvenience of al driver
who is stopped and it is the state’s contention that that would
come down on the side of the state to exercise this type of
■activity.
There has been no allegation ©f discrimination by
the Respondent.

There are no facts other than supposition or

hypothesis that this could be abused.

Case law is clear that

24
in situations where there is abuse that can be shown — it was
shown in the Hyland

case cited by the Defendants where long­

haired individuals were stopped and no ease of which the state
is aware has the exclusionary rule ever been extended to a
situation in which there has bean no proof ©f illegal police
conduct and we would submit that that would be an erroneous
extension of the exclusionary rule.

anything that was found in the car following this stop may not
be used in evidence in any single case.
MR. LUKOFFs
QUESTION:

Is that right?

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
Suppose instead of the prohibited drugs

they had found in the trunk of the ear a human being bound and
gagged who was :eing kidnapped?

You could not prosecute ‘the

kidnapper for that offense, then, under your theory and under
the theory of the Supreme Court of Delaware.

Well, that, Mr. Justice Stevens, is

The state is asking here for the mare oppor­

tunity to seise the vehicle for a moment, as they state, for
checking licens® and registration.
QUESTION:

Let ra® add a factor.

The victim,

hearing soma conversation, makes enough noise in the back of
the trunk so that the suspicions of the police are esscitad
and aroused.
MR. LUKOFF :

There is obviously no question that

they could assist the victim.

That is of first and utmost

importance„
QUESTION:

the kidnapper.

Mr. Chief Justice, is that is in fact the case.

Because that

QUESTION:

them.

There are a lot of ways you can find evidence of crime

if you do not have any limitation on the amount of stopping and
searching you do.
MR. LUKOFF:

That is, in fact, the case.

The state

is not asking, as I understand it, to have the authority to go
beyond just the initial seizure.

They are not attempting to

search the vehicle or stop the vehicle in any manner looking
for other evidence.
QUESTION:

Suppose we return to my question now,

to complete your answer about fell® body in the back of the ear.
MR. LUKOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, the difficulty, ©f

I think

it would follow as the most horrible situation, perhaps, that
assuming that, in fact, the body is in the back of the car,
th®'s if the seizure is invalid, the seizure is unconstitutional,
that it would therefore follow that evidence would be .excluded.
But. that xa not what the state is looking for nor
asserting as an interest hero.

on© of traffic safety, that the documents that ar® possessed by
th® individual in some way ar© going to assist them In that

the practice of game wardens of making random stops to see
whether the hunters have licenses and also to s@© whether or

killed at that time or perhaps duck hunters have killed more

QUESTION:

I thought you conceded that it was an

important interest.
MR. LDKQFF?

Mr. Justice Rahnquist, we did not con­

cede that — we concede that traffic safety is an important
interest and that is the asserted interest that the state has
presented hare.
QUESTION?

Well, the State of Delaware has deter­

mined, apparently, that the way it will further that interest
is by the policy of random stops that apparently everyone has
agreed upon in

discussing this.

You describe it as arbitrary.

The stata describas it as random.

When a police officer is not

called out on any other thing more major, he simply will stop
a car at random without any reason to believe that the person
does not have a license and without any articulable' grounds for
bsuspicion.
MR. LUKOFF:

That is what the state is attempting

to get.
QUESTION:
MR. LUKOFF?

That is their policy.

the state policy or the policy of on® police officer?•
MR. LUKOFF?

That is not, as I understand it, the

state policy, Mr, Justice Marshall,

Mr. Justice Reimquist, I would refer specifically
to questioning of Officer Av®na in the suppression hearing in
which he was asked whether there are departmental regulations
and he answered in the negative-? none that h© knew of.
whether there was an

And

Attorney General guideline and he also

answered in the negative and I have reviewed the statutes and
there is nothing in the statutes which permit this.
QUESTIONS

Well, then, let us say it was the policy

of this particular officer to do that®

No one disagrees about

that, do they?

K'.:, :r-‘

he does it sometimes.

Well, the disagreement is that he says

It is - arbitrary.

He can choose

whomever he pleases9 for whatever reason.
QUESTIONS

Well, unless the Constitution forbids

MR. LUKOFF?

’

Our position is that the Constitution,

her©.

That is true, Mr. Justice White.
And the random problem has no relevance

It really does not.

33
MR. LUKQFFs

Mr. Chief Justice,, the difficulty

with randomness is how you test whether it is truly random.
If there is soma form of electronic device which picks every
tenth car in a truly random manner? that may b@ random.
QUESTIONs

Well, ami you not assume that a police-

man can count up to ten?
MR. LUKQFF:

We can assume that but we cannot

assume that he ■—
QUESTIONS

He does not n©@d an electronic device

to stop every tenth car? does he?
MR. LUKQFFs

He does not need that? Mr. Chief

Justice? but the difficulty is that how do we check as to
whether or not he in fact is doing ’that?

Again, it is arbitrary,

if all he says is, "I stopped the tenth car.”

We do not know

it was not the eleventh or the ninth.
QUESTIONs

Your response to Mr. Justice Whits

indicates that it would not make any difference for your case
in the position you are taking whether the state legislature had
authorized the Attorney General to promulgate rules?' guidelines
and he promulgated them and said the officers may do thus and
so, you would still make the same points.
MR, LUKQFFj

Mr. Chief Justice, that presents a

slightly different problem.

There are different legal issues

that may b® involved if the legislature has spoken, being the
duly-elected officials of the paople.

The question there is,

34
again, there wonId have to he some way to test the guidelines,
we submit.
QUESTION 5

I think that your response to the Chief

.Justice certainly differs from — shows that you differ, at
least, from my understanding of constitutional law that I would
think that the action taken by the state here and. represented
by a state attorney represents the policy of the state, albeit
you cannot argue that it is a uniformly-applied policy and that
for the legislature to place its imprimata on the policy does
not make it any different from a constitutional point of view.
MR. LUKOFFs

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the state

has not taken it upon itself to give us any guidance.

There is

nothing in the record that can be shown or that 1 know of
personally about the State of Delaware in which they have said,
"This procedure is going to be followed.”
It is true, the state has appealed this case, has
brought writ of cart to this point but that does not give us
the sanction that the defense would submit is necessary.
QUESTION:

Does the Supreme Court of Delaware have

any authority to speak for the State of Delaware?
MR. LUKOFF:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Wall, it said, "We rule that before the

government may single out an automobile to stop it, there must
exist specific facts justifying the intrusion.

Conversely, a

random stop in the absence of specific justifying facts is

35
unreasonable and unconstitutional."
That is the Suprema Court of the State of Delaware.
MR. LUKOFFi

That is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I have spoken to that issue.
QUESTION s

Does that have as much authority as the

designee of the Attorney General's office?

QUESTION?

QUESTIONs

QUESTION:■

^question to ask®

Mr® Lukoff,

1'have a rath®r"'s@rious

The record, as 1 understand it, shows that

Mr. Prouse was sot '‘die driver of the oar, that there were three
passengers in the car and that the officer's tesfcimosiy suggests
. that h© was not the driver.
1 do not think under Raicus against Illinois ha
has standing to raise the Federal Constitutional Issue.

So

is it not neces rary to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted?

the difficulty ©£ course is that it is elaar from the record
that Mr. Prouse was the registered owner o£ the vehicle, that
Im had a proprietary interest in the vehicle because of his
ownership.
Now, 1 do not believe Ralcas would apply in the

It is our position that the state interest, asserted
