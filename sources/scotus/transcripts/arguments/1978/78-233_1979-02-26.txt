MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v, Feeney.
Mr, Kll@ys I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. KILEY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. KILEY:
Court:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

My name is Thomas R» Kileys and I am the First

Assistant Attorney General of the Oommoswaalth of Massachusetts,
With me as counsel today is Attorney General Francis X, Bellotfci.
We appear today in defense of the Commonwealths
veterans9 preference statute9 a statute which was codified
when challenged, is Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 31»
section 231 and which is set forth in the

form in which it

existed at that time at page three of our

brief.

In essneee, it is a positional veterans® preference
statute which places veterans who qualify for civil service
jobs by passing examinations at the top of civil service lists
of those eligible for appointment to jobs.
This positional preference statute Is challenged by
Helen B. Feeney, a 7 on-veteran female who alleges that the
application of the

statute denies her and

gendre equal protection of the laws.

The

people of
thrust of

her
her com­

plaint is that few vomen are veterans and that application ©f

the veterans’ preference naturally excludes women from civil
service jobs.
The case comes to this Court on appeal from a
divided three-judge panel of the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts.

That court first decided

this case in March of 1976, invalidating the state statute
largely on the basis of its impact on women.

On our original

appeal9 you remanded the cause to the District Court for
reconsideration in light of Washington v. Davis, a case which
we submit repudiated the impact analysis used by the court
below»
QUESTION:

Is this exclusively an equal protection

case?
MR. KILEY:

It is explicitly an equal protection

ease, Mr» Justice Stewart.

It could not be a title 7 case.

Under title 7® veterans’ preference statutes are explicitly
excluded»
QUESTION:

And no reliance is placed upon the due

"i

process clause?
MR. KILEY:

It is an equal protection clause ease as

it has been decided.
QUESTION:
MR. KILEY:

And as has been argued, supported?
Yes, Mr» Justice Stewart»

The thre@*»judg® panel reconsidered this ease on the
original record and adhered to its original ruling, essentially

5
agreeing with Mrs. Feeney’s basic contention that the veterans*
preference statute as applied in Massachusetts Invidiously
discriminates against women in violation of the equal protection clause.

We obviously disagree with that conclusions

but we do not disagree with everything that the District Courthad to say in this cases and the areas of agreements are im­
portant to emphasise

at the outset of the argument because

they serve to narrow our focus»
First3 nobody seems to contend that the concept of
civil service hiring preference for veterans is itself uncon­
stitutional.

Each of the judges who considered this eases

the parties before this Court and the amicus curiae all seem
to start from the premise that veterans® hiring preferences
are constitutional In that they further important societal
objectives.
QUESTIONt

That is, there is no claim that — assume

there were an equal number of males and females who are
veterans and non-veterans — there is no claim that the dis­
crimination in favor of veterans and against non-veterans is
itself —
ME. KXLEY:
QUESTION:

Unconstitutional„
— violative of the equal protection

clause.
MR» KILEYs

And those who challenge the concept of

veterans9 preference8 those who challenge this preference do

6
not challenge it because of tlhe concept but because they be­
lieve this statute goes too far.
QUESTION:
MR. KILEYs

And discriminates against females.
I think the essence of the District

Court's opinion is that there is nothing unconstitutional
about the statute even though fewer women benefit3 but that
this particular statute goes too far.
QUESTION;
opinion.

Well, you refer to the District Court’s

You really have to take Judge Campbell’s opinion

and Judge Tauro’s opinion together, don’t you9 to
MR. KILEY:

Frankly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, 1 think

I have to take both of their opinions in both of the eases
because of the way this particular case happens to come be­
fore the court.
To the extent that the disagreement on the form of
the particular statute may be appropriately framed in the
judicial as opposed, to legislative forum, its resolution
before this Court may well turn on the operation of the
Massachusetts civil service system and the facts of this
particular case.
If I accomplish nothing else todays I hope to focus
the Court’s attention on the operation of the statute and on
the facts in this case.
The second statement of the District Court's
opinions with which we wholeheartedly concur is the conclusion

7
that the Massachusetts veterans’ preference was not enacted
for the purpose of disqualifying women from receiving civil
service positions, and Its concession that the state’s prime
objective of aiding those who serve our country in time of
war is rational and legitimate0
The third point on which we agree with the lower
court is that this case is not a vehicle for an evaluation of
the constitutionality of federal enlistment policies, policies
xtfhlch the plaintiff, Mrs0 Feeney, presumes amount to a de jure
system of sex discrimination in federal military service.
If the plaintiff or a class of women want to chal­
lenge the federal enlistment policies, let them do so directly
and not collaterally and let the federal government have the
opportunity to defend its own statutes and regulations.
We are concerned here today not with the federal
policies themselves but solely with the question of the
validity of the Massachusetts veterans’ preference and the
answer to the question turns largely, according to the plain­
tiffs, on the application, operation and effects of the
statuteo
Before any analysis of this case, we must begin
with an understanding of the Massachusetts civil service
system.

To begin with, all state jobs are not covered by

that system.

Forty percent of the jobs, many of the upper

level, higher paying, policy-making positions, the kind of

8
positions this Court discussed in Elrod vD Burns, are not
covered by the civil service system at all.

Sixty percent of

the jobs are and they fall entirely into two categories of
jobs®

They are the classified labor service and the classi­

fied official service, and Mrs» Feeney's challenge in this
case goes only to or at least her evidence in this case goes
only to the official classified service, one of the two com­
ponents»
QUESTION:
MR. KILEY:

That is the classified official service?
Classified official service.

I tend to

mix up my adjectives, I think.
QUESTION:

Does Massachusetts have the same veterans'

preference with respect to each?
MR, KILEY:

Yes, we do.

In the labor service, there

is not the same examination procedures that we go through in
the labor section.

In fact, the plaintiff and the court

below seem to have narrowed the focus even further , conceding
that women obtain a significant proportion of the jobs in the
category of classified official service, but arguing that
they are excluded from upper level higher paying jobs, what­
ever they may be.
Anyone who applies for a —
QUESTION:

In that service?

MR» KILEY:

In that service.

Anyone who applies for

a position in that service Is required as a first step to pass

9
a qualifying examination.

On many of the lists that we have

seen before us In the record,, that qualifying examination
weeds out significant numbers of applicantse

Those who do

pass the examination are placed on eligible lists.

But

veterans who do not pass that qualifying examination get no
form of veterans5 preference whatsoever.

Those who do pass

are placed on elip’ible lists and the personnel administrator
of the commonwealth applying Massachusetts law prepares those
lists by listing first disabled veterans, then veterans, then
surviving spouses or widowss and finally all others who pass
within each group in accordance with their respective examin­
ation scores «,

It is now surviving spouses and widows

As it stands, the argument is that it has a dispro­

Chief Justice0
QUESTION:

Is it also true that — let's move it up

military service, in combat?

Perhaps 60 is

QUESTION:

I am talking in terms of numbers.

How

11
many men — what percentage of the armed forces of World War
II are over 50 years of age, unless they were colonels or
generals?
MR* KILEY:

My reference I think, Mr„ Chief Justice,

is to the age of individuals now and the preferences that
operate now,

The class of non-eligltoles for the veterans5

preference includes approximately a million males„

The class

of preference eligibles includes about 800,000 males, about
16,000 females„
After passing an examination, one waits for a
requisition to come from a particular appointing authority0
And while there are various methods of certification that the
personnel administrator uses, they all share one prime
characteristic, and that is that he certifies more names than
there are positions to be filled.

Moreover, at this stage of

the process, at least now in Massachusetts, the personnel
administrator may certify a number of minority or women equal
to the number of individuals who would be certified under the
normal process if he first makes a determination that there
has been discrimination against those people on the basis of
race, sex, or national origin»
The final step in the appointment process is the
actual hiring, and it ia made by an appointing authority, not
by the personnel administrator.

It is important to emphasise

that the appointing authority need not appoint those who appear

12
at the top of the list.

Certification guarantees considera-’

tion but not appointment, and an appointing authority is free
to reach past the individual who appears at the top of the
list and hire somebody who appears beneath him or her®

Thus,

a veteran who is looking at the civil service system from the
outside faces two significant barriers to employment®

First,

he has to pass the civil service examination and then, even
if he gets to the top of the list, he may not be hired by the
particular appointing authority.

It is that sysem that Helen

Feeney challengesa
As I stated earlier, she is not a veteran and she
never made application to serve in the military, although in
World War II she was of an age when her peers, her contempo­
raries in terms of age were of an age when they were either
volunteering or faced conscription®

In fact, Helen Feeney’s

affidavit tells us the reason that she did not enter the
service, although she inquired as to admission practices, is
that her mother didn’t think that the reputation of women in
the military at the time was good.
Helen Feeney turned 21 in 19^3.
apply to the military thereafter.

She chose not to

Helen Feeney has an expan­

sive employment record, spanning 28 years from 19^8 to 1975®
The early years of that service fall in private sector jobs.
Until 1963, she x^orked exclusively In the private sector.
1962, she took and passed her first open competitive civil

In

13
service examination.

It was for a clerical position, and in

1963 she was appointed to the clerical position in the
Massachusetts Civil Defense Agency.

She held that clerical

position for approximately four years, at which time she took
and passed an open promotional examination and became the
agency’s Federal Funds & Personnel Coordinator,

She remained

in that position for approximately eight years, until a point
within 53 days of the date she filed this particular action.
On that data, the Civil Defense Agency was effectively
abolished in Massachusetts,
In addition to the two open competitive examinations
that she took regarding the Civil Defense Agency, Helen Feeney
took and passed approximately seven open examinations in the
civil service system in the ten years proceeding this com­
plaint.

For one reason or another, she was never appointed to

any of the positions for which she applied.

But she predicates

the complaint largely on two particular positions which she
applied for and did not obtain.

Those two positions are the
«

head Administrative Assistant to the Solomon Mental Health
Center, Exhibit 2 of the appendix pertains to that slot, and
to the positions of Administrative Assistant in the Mental
Health System generally, and Exhibit 6 in the appendix per­
tains to that.
Now, I will return to these two positions later in
my argument and I will demonstrate that in each instance any

Injury that Helen Feeney suffered by virtue of the applica­
tion of veterans5 preference was an injury that she shared
in common with male non-veterans and that she would have
suffered the same kind of injury whatever the form of
veterans* preference had been applied.

By that, I mean if a

five- and ten-point preference model on the federal system
had been in effect»
Before this Court3 the plaintiff has recast the
issue, if you will, and she now asks the question whether a
preference which excludes women from competitive civil service
positions, by granting men an absolute preference violates the
14th Amendment.

Her argument makes it clear that she uses

the word ’'competitive*1 in this context in the sense that it
is used to apply to upper level, higher paying positions,,
There are two over-statements in this formulation
of the issue which I want to bring to the attention of the
Court9

The first is the assertion that the preference af­

forded to veterans is absolute.

As the earlier discussion

of the Massachusetts system shows, preference is not absolute
in any sense Of the word0

Veterans first have to pass quali­

fying examinations in order to benefit from the preference,
and then may be passed over for people ranking lower on the
eligible lists»
The second major over-statement which courses
throughout the argument is that somehow Helen Feeney and women

15
have been excluded, excluded from the federal military by
restrictive policies, are excluded from the Massachusetts
civil service system by application of veterans9 preference.
We submit that the record in this case just does
not support those broad conelus ryo

statements.

Both the

exclusary effects of this statute and of the restrictive
federal policies are more fiction than fact.

While veterans9

preference does benefit a class comprised more significantly
of men than females, this adverse incidental impact is not
enough to invalidate the statute in an equal protection
challengeo
QUESTION:

Mr0 Kiley, in reading the Massachustts

statute, at least as it is described, in the District Court
opinion, section 23 as I see it just refers to other veterans
in order of their composite scores after disabled veterans»
Is it a separate statutory provision that provides that they
must have been veterans in time of war?
MR» KILEY:

Yes, the provision on defining what a

veteran is is chapter 4, section 7 of the general laws»

It is

a definitional section which applies throughout Massachusetts
law.
QUESTION:

And that is set forth in the brief?

MR. KILEY:

It is set forth 5.n the briefs.

The

»

statute it cited.
it is clause 43«

It is chapter

section 7S and I believe

16
Any methodology of equal protection analysis begins
with a focus on the classification’s facial neutrality of the
nature of a particular classification.

I do not intend to

spend much time on the nature of this particular classifica­
tion.

The statute in question clearly draws lines, but it

draws lines not on the basis of one’s gender but on the basis
of objectively identifiable standards shared by individuals
of both sexes»

It bestows competitive advantages on in­

dividuals, regardless of their sex, who performs military
service for the Nation in time of war or who lost a husband,
a wife, a son or daughter.

Those preference eligibles are

objectively Identifiable and they are objectively identifiable
on the basis of characteristics which have nothing to do with
gender,
The pool of eligibles and the pool of ineligibles
are both comprised of significant numbers of people of both
sexes and under any categorisation this statute is facially
neutral in terms of gender»

However uneven the application

of the statute may be, you never obviate that facial
neutrality.
In Washington v. Davis, this Court articulated the
principle that fits such facially neutral acts will not be
invalidated solely on the basis of discriminatory impact»
In Arlington Heights, you amplified on that holding and sug­
gested a number of evidentiary factors which can illuminate

17
the search for discriminatory intent.
One might have thought that the search in this par­
ticular case would have been very simple»

After all, the

District Court the first time around in this ease stated that
the Massachusetts veterans’ preference statute was not en­
acted for purpose of dlsqulifying women from receiving civil
service appointments, but that the statute’s laudable purpose
was not enough to insulate it from judicial invalidation.
This was because, in view of the District Court, in the context
of the 14th Amendment

it was the result and not the intent

of the Act which mattered»
In spite of the obvious differences between that
holding and this Court’s holdings in Washington v. Davis and
Arlington Heights, in this ease the District Court did make
a finding on remand of discriminatory intent»

And I submit

that the methodology that the court used in doing so cannot be
condoned by this Court.
QUESTION?

Well, I don’t read Judge Campbell’s

opinion to make a finding of discriminatory intent»

I read

Judge Tauro’s opinion to find that.
MRo KILEY;

I would suggest that Judge Tauro9s

opinion makes a specific findings of intent.

Judge Campbell

articulates the premise, but under Washington v8 Davis this
is a very difficult case to deal with, and to the extent that
one must find discriminatory Intent in order to invalidate the

18
statute, it is there, he votes to invalidate it.
QUESTION:

Well, let me read you from page 19a of

the jurisdictional statement, where he says — about the
middle of the page — to be sure the legislature did not
wish to harm women, "But the cutting~off of women’s oppor­
tunities was an inevitable concomitant of the chosen scheme
as Inevitable as the proposition that If tails is up, heads
must be down.

Where a law’s consequences are that Inevitable,

can they meaningfully be described as unintended?

Doubtless

the impact on women, if considered at all, was regarded as an
acceptable ’cost’ of aiding veterans,"

I would read that

simply as saying that where the foreseeable consequences are
that obvious, they won't save a statute even though the intent
was not there to discriminate between men and women.
MR. KXLEY;

I think that if I might characterise

Judge Campbell’s opinion, he Is saying that foreseeability of
impact is the equivalent of a finding of intent, and if the
results are inevitable, that that in Itself, that predictably
discriminatory impact is a substitute for intent,

I would

submit that awareness of probable disparate effect can never
be the constitutional equivalent of a finding of invidious
intent to discriminate.
QUESTION?

You wouldn’t suggest that a court review­

ing a statute like this couldn,t find as a fast from inevifcA

able consequences that there was In fact discriminatory intent?

19
MR. KILEY:

I think that one can use foreseeability

of impact under limited circumstances as a factor in the
evidentiary search,, in the search for clear and convincing
evidence or for substantial evidence that intent exists.

But

I do not think that foreseeability of impact in and of itself
can ever satisfy an Intent ease, unless the case — unless
the impact is so disparate as that in Yick Wo or Qommilion or
the types of cases that this Court discussed in Arlington
Heights and in Washington v. Davis.
Legislative awareness of a probable disparate
effect is not the constitutional equivalent of purposeful
discrimination»

The contention of the plaintiff echoed in

the opinions of the lower court that the purpose, motive and
Intent somehow all mean different things in a constitutional
sense I think is treated quite well in the Solicitor General’s
amicus brief.

He makes the point that purpose, intent and

motive all have the same kind of ~ all mean the same thing
in constitutional cases and that the Court should be looking
for convincing evidence of the motive or motives which in­
fluenced a particular governmental act.
Now, the court in this case focused primarily on
the impact of the statute, saying that the impact was pre­
dictable

and that it was devastating, and they pointed es­

sentially to four types of proof of that fact — Mrs. Feeney’s
own employment record, the employment record of other women in

20
the official classified service, some unquantifled general
statements about the way veterans5 preference operates that
appear in paragraph 20 of the agreed statement, and then an
analysis of fifty lists which were appended to the complaint
as examples of thousands of lists — as an example of lists
on which women were harmed by the application of veterans5
preference but not as typical lists,
Mrs. Feeney’s own employment record doesn’t demon­
strate the proposition that women were absolutely excluded
from upper level civil service jobs and by the application of
veterans9 preference.
QUESTION;

General Kiiey, you are not seriously

contending, are you, that this veterans’ preference doesn’t
have an extremely discriminatory impact on women, that 98
percent or some such percentage of all the veterans in
i

Massachusetts are males?
MR. KILEY:

Is that correct?

I am contending that the impact of this

particular statute has been consistently over-stated.
it on this basis:

I do

Helen Feeney herself held a significant

civil service position.

The single largest group of in­

dividuals hired in the ten-year period, if they are based on
both sex and veterans’ status, is non-veteran femalesa
obtained 42.2 percent of all of the jobs in the ten-year
period.
QUESTION:

In this classification?

They

21

MRo KILEY:

In this classification — far* out­

stripping male veterans,, far out-stripping male non-veterans.
QUESTION:

Why should that be with the veterans’

preference?
MR. KILEY:

All X am saying, Mr. Justice Stewart,

is QUESTION;

Well, why is it with the veterans' pref­

erence?
MRo KILEY:

My own personal view Is that tradition­

ally men and women do not always compete for the same jobs.
We submitted an affidavit of Wallace Counts which pertains to
a two-month period after the court originally Invalidated
this veterans’ preference statute in 1976 and have demon­
strated that on 61 percent of the lists compiled in that timeframe, veterans’ preference would have made no difference on
the gender classification of those certified 6l percent of
the times.

Men and women do not simply always compete.
QUESTION;

That is ancient history now. Isn’t it?

Remember9 we had a case about a woman who wanted to be a
prison guard In Alabama.
MRo KILEY;
QUESTION;
MR. KILEY;

i do3

I remember the case well.

Do you remember that case?
I do.

QUESTION;

That was out of the ordinary, wasn’t it?

MR„ KILEY;

I don’t know whether It was out of the

ordinary,
QUESTION:

Well, aren’t all civil rights Individual

rights?
MR. KILEY:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Certainly.

And isn’t that ordinary right be just as

important —
MR. KILEY:

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.

All I am

suggesting is that in this record, in the time frame that we
have this evidences women obtained significantly more jobs

Well, the record I think I can remember

is ’’certain jobs»”

QUESTION
MR» KILEY:

The figures we have -That is typical, isn’t it?
The figures that we have -~
That hasn’t gone yet, has it?
The figures which we have, Mr. Justice

Marshall, are for the entire official classified service»
Now, the court would extrapolate from fifty lists which were
appended as examples of lists on which women were harmed ~
the court would extripolate the conclusion that somehow women
are excluded from upper level positions, but those positions
are listed in the appendix at pages 9^ to 96, and those po­
sitions, I think if the Court will look at them, do not
demonstrate or are not themselves upper level positions.

23
There are positions on there like school bus monitor,
telephone operator, teacher's aide — those aren't the kind
of upper level positions that the court can be talking about
when they say women are excluded from upper level, higher
paying positions»
The broad general statements that common awareness
tell us are true, that i?omen and men don't always compete,
that in some instances veterans’ preference will hire more
women than men, those are truisms, but they do not support
the —QUESTIONS

I will also give you a truism, that a

lot of women don't even bother taking the test because they
are not veterans and they know they can't overcome the great
big handicap»
MR. KILEY:

It may be, it is somevrtiat speculative.

The only indication in this record that that is the case is
that Helen Feeney in her affidavit says in some instances
she herself did not take examinations.
What 1 am suggesting is that, after Washington v.
Davis and after Arlington Heights, a lower court has to look
for clear evidence, hard evidence that there is an invidious
intent to discriminate.

The impact in this case on this

record does not demonstrate that kind of impact.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kiley, do you take the position that

the legislature must have specifically Intended to harm women

2H
before this
MR. KILEY:

I think that there has to be a motivat-

ing factor which if it is not characterized as an intent to
harm women,, is an intent to perpetuate archaic and over-broad
stereotypical notions about the roles of women„

There has

to be a motivating factor which is in some way invidious.
QUESTION;

Is there any big medical truck like the

one for TB that you drive up to the legislature and have them
all go through and find out what was on their mind?
MR. KILEY:
QUESTION:;
MR. KILEY:
QUESTION::
MR3 KILEY;

No»
Well., what other way could we do it?
No9 I am not —
What other way could we do It?
I think that the Court has articulates

the way in which the lower court looks for motivations, and you
look to every scintilla of subjective or objective evidence
that one can find.

You have articulated evidentiary factors»

All I am saying in this case is that those eviden­
tiary factors do not support an inference of intent, and that
minimum rationality applies.
Now* under traditional standards of equal protection
analysis and minimum rationality, we are not concerned with
the wisdom of a particular statute»

There is no requirement

that the Massachusetts legislature served every conceivable
social value in formulating their civil service system and

25
their veterans5 preference statute,

There can be no better

example of the need for elbow room for state legislatures
than in the area of distributing civil service jobs to
veterans, minorities, women, and still balancing the interests
of the state in an effective federal work force®
Indeed, the fact Is that legislators throughout
this country grappling with these weighty problems have
adopted a myriad of approaches to veterans5 preference
statutes.

Almost no two of them are alike.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P® WARD, ESQ„s
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. WARD:
Court:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please the

I am Richard Ward, and 1 represent the appellee, Helen

B. Feeney®
Before turning to the difficult legal questions

26
presented by this eases whether the adverse and disastrous
impact upon women is in fact a deliberate discrimination
sufficient so that this Court should pay perhaps some less
deference to the legislative judgments, and then applying
that standard to the question of whether or not the profit
objectives are in fact substantially well served by
Massachusetts’ choice of an absolute and permanent form of
preferencee
In light of the Commom^ealth’s arguments it is im­
portant to understand exactly how this absolute preference
system works and to understand the significant systematic
adverse impact on women B

And I don*t believe that the

Commonwealth has carefully enough demonstrated or indeed
admitted what that impact is8
Most of Brother Klley’s argument rests on the fact
that 42 percent of the persons over a ten-year period who
obtained jobs were female*

That entirely misses the thrust

of this action, the thrust of Helen Feeney’s case, and indeed
the basis of the court’s decision below.

It also misses the

admission of one of the prime defendants in this ease, the
Director of Civil Service, who himself stated for the court
exactly how the system worked, especially in light of more
recent changes in the civil service system, where now they
have what are called banded examinations for large numbers
©f positions which large numbers of persons apply, including

27
large numbers of veterans who are principally male and large
numbers of non-veterans for upper level or positions of
significance who are principally female.
The Director of Civil Service, in his testimony
to the court below in the form of affidavit, said that the
system would work as follows:

Women will continue to be

employed primarily in the relatively low-paying entry level
clerical positions for which men traditionally do not apply»
He goes on to say, however, for the relatively
high paying civil service positions, such as programmers,
planners, psychologists, administrative assistants, head
administrative assistants, et cetera, the continued use of
the veterans3 preference statute will result in few if any
female eligibles being considered and appointed to such po­
sitions»

Thus, it is not a true demonstration of the effect

upon women simply to point to the fact that k2 percent of
all the persons hird were female.

They are principally being

hired as secretaries, in the stereotypic jobs for which
Massachusetts for seventy-five years has allowed women to
obtain and allowed women to obtain in

more rigorous,

explicit sex distinctions in terms of the practice for
seventy-five years of recruiting on the basis of sex, the
female jobs and male jobs»
This Is the thrust of the action and one must under­
stand exactly how this veterans' preference system works»

28
Although referred to below as an absolute preference — and*
indeed, this Court is faced with the most extreme form of
preference, what is generally known as an absolute preference„
The Commonwealth,, of course,
tional preference.

refers to it here as a posi­

It doesn’t sound so bad.

But it is an

absolute preference in the following sense»
What it does is it places a head on an

QUESTIONS

>

What if number three is a non-veteran,

f may he be picked?
MR. WARD;

Yes, Your Honor, If he is certified»

The

problem with the system is there are so many veterans apply­
ing for Jobs of significance that the veterans all go to the
top of the list, about all non-veterans, regardless of the
score»

So it is absolute in that sense, and that is the

sense in which it distinguishes this form of preference from

29
a point preference, which only gives veterans some help or
moves them up somewhat relatively, but doesn't move them as a
group to the top of the list.
Essentially the way it works ■=>- and 1 think one of
the best lists to look at is in Exhibit 7, which is the
administrative assistant list, and that is one of these
banded examinations, for which 43 administrative assistant
positions are available —
QUESTION:

What page, do you happen to know?

MR. WARD;

Pardon?

QUESTION:

What page is Exhibit 7 on, do you happen

MR. WARD;

Not off the top of my head.

QUESTION:

Well, I can probably find it®

MR. WARD;

It can be found.

QUESTION:

I see, page 132.

MR® WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

to know?

Go ahead*

There are approximately 1?6 people that "were found
Ineligible.

Twenty-three percent of the eligibles upon that

administrative assistant list, that is Exhibit 7, were
females.

As a result of the application of the preference,

however, in terms of the top 43 positions on that list to be
certified, to be considered for these 43 jobs, no females
were on the eligible list.
QUESTION:

Do you think the average veteran

30
non-disabled has the same argument to make as you are making
now with respect to disabled veterans?
MR. WARD:

No, Your Honor, I donst believe so.

Some

of them may* if the court at some point articulates the
standard for persons who are handicapped,

Some male non-

veterans, through no fault of their own9 are also discriminat­
ed against.

But what sets apart the discrimination against

women in this case from the discrimination against non­
veteran males is the very basis upon which we suggest that
this should be considered a deliberate discrimination against
femalesp and that is principally because of the fact that the
veteran classification amounts to a condition precedent to
being able to obtain a job and it necessarily incorporates
by reference the de.eades of discrimination against women in
terms ~ by the military, in terms of entry into the military.
Whole categories of women were not allowed into the service,
and whether that is right or wrong or lawful or unlawful as
far as the military is concerned, nonetheless it is a discrimination0

Whole categories of women, women who happened

to be married were not allowed in the service,

Women who

had minor children^ the female parent were.not allowed in the
service.

Women had to wait until age 21„ otherwise they

needed parental consent.

Males over the age of 18 did not

need parental consent,,
QUESTION;

Is it also discriminatory to bar women

31
from combat and then make combat service the basis of the
preference?
TOo WARDs
the following sense.
QUESTION;

I believe it would be, Your Honor, in
It could have -Are women permitted in combat service

now under the existing law?
MR. WARDs

Generally not, Your Honor.

But the

discrimination, of course,, is far more — was more severe
than that, resulting in really the systematic exclusion of
women from the military*

And the decision that is at stake

is the judgment of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, how
will it run its public employment system*

And what it has

don®, whether there is justification for that discrimination
against the military, is taken all those restrictions by
making the veterans’ classification, as the court found
below, a replacement for testing as the determining factor
as to who appears on the top of the list.

Massachusetts has

incorporated wholesale all these entry level restrictions
of the military into its public employment system, and it is
that judgment for which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
we submit, should be held responsible*
QUESTION:

Mr0 Ward, is there any way under your

argument 'where Massachusetts could retain the preference for
disabled veterans and nonetheless give it up for non-disabled
veterans?

32
MRo WARD:

Your Honor-s in terms of the record pr@“>

sented to the court below

and* for example9 Exhibit 12 —

one would sea that the number of disabled veterans that apply
is relatively minor in number as to the number of disabled
veterans who apply and are eligibles is relatively minor in
comparison with the total number of veterans.

As a result9

the impact indeed would be much less severe if they simply
had a preference for veterans9 whether or not an absolute
preference for disabled veterans would indeed still have the
•inevitable systematic exclusionary effect on women which
i\ /

leads to9 as what the court found belows the mere blanket

;

t

exclusion of women from all upper level Jobs of interest to
mal®o

We don8t know on this record,, but we think there might

well fee a distinction,

That would be a leaser form of

•

preference.
Of course* what the court is faced with here is one
of the most extreme forms in terms of 9 as the court below
said* a broad-brush approach,
QUESTION:

I was asking under your argument whether

a disabled veteran preference could survive.

Is your answer

yes or no?
MK0 WARD:

Th© answer is a disabled veteran would

still constitute to the extent it produced a disproportionate
impact on women* because of the incorporation of the military
discrimination* it would still be an intentional

33
discrimination against women and is deliberates but it might
well survive the heightened level of scrutiny accorded by
this Court in terms of whether or not the means chosen being
reasonably tailored to disabled veterans who perhaps are In
the most need of rehabilitation or some readjustment assis­
tance, that might well pass the so-called middle level
scrutiny because it is a more finely tailored means8

But I

think it would still be a deliberate discriminations Your
Honor, but it perhaps might pass muster under the substan­
tial relation test.

QUESTION:

in Washington v. Davisa does the inten­

tional or deliberate or knowing discrimination against a
particular group — In this case, women — have to be a dis­
crimination against that group as women, an intention to
discriminate against women, or can it just — what if it is
simply, as it appears on the face of this statute, an in­
tention to discriminate against non»»veterans, with knowledge
that many more women are non-veterans than men?

MRo WARD:

I believe, Your Honor, that under

Washington va Davis, in order to invoke this Court's somewhat
heightened level of scrutiny, we have to show that the dis­
crimination is a deliberate one against women, and we believe
the record adequately substantiates that fact.

QUESTIONj

So that discrimination against non-

veterans, which it clearly is on its face —

MR, WARD;

Yes* it is,

QUESTION:

In any equal protection ease then, if

you get Into court and you make the record and show that this

automatically foreseeable impact and you would always get
your injunction.

QUESTION:

Well, what else do you rely on?

MR. WARD:

We rely on two other principal factors.

First of all, the fast that we make a distinction between
foreseeability and inevitability.

We don't believe those

problems of the foreseeability test «=QUESTIONs

QUESTION:

Statutory.

MR. WARD:

Statutory, but the Court did suggest

that you are dealing with a different type of problem when
you in fact burden the group, and here we have a group that
hs§‘ historically been u Mened in the employment context.

We

have women, women constitute two-thirds of the non-veterans
and virtually all the w'vmen are in the non-veteran category,
Massachusetts sets up a preference so absolute that systemat­
ically they are excluded from every .job

of Interest for

males.
And to .set back to Mr. Justice White8s question, we
do have additional evidence.

If foreseeability and inevitab­

ility is not enough to satisfy this Court’s view of when is

38
enough proof shown that we will hold the state responsible
because of a deliberate and purposeful discrimination, we
must bear In mind that this particular classification on Its
face incorporates essentially by reference the military dis­
crimination., but more than that, we have the entire legisla­
tive history,
In examination of the legislative history of the
public employment system in Massachusetts, it shows that for

85 years the Commonwealth Intended to expressly treat males
and females differently; right along with its reason for
having the policy for having an absolute preference, the
Commonwealth also had a policy of separately requisitioning
and recruiting on the basis of male jobs and female jobs,,
and there is substantial evidence in the record that shows
this®

Exhibits 6*1 through 79 —
QUESTION:

Mr. Ward, if you pursue that argument, it

seems to me you have an even stronger case against the
federal statutes that discriminate because there is a history
in the military of discriminating between men and \romen, so
this clearly would invalidate all of the federal veterans’
preferenes, I suppose.
MR® WARD:

We think not, Your Honor®

Again, one

might find that —
QUESTION:

Your burden benefit distinction?

MR, WARD:

—» all the veterans’ preferences

39
constitute some deliberate discrimination against women, but
they might be tailored finely enough to their purposes that
they would pass the appropriate level of scrutiny.
QUESTION:

Your brief makes a

pretty persuasive

argument that they weren’t very finely tailored»
MR. WARD:

Not in this case, Your Honor.

In this

QUESTION:

No, I am talking about the federal ones.

one —

You have discussed those in your brief. In the military, and
you quite persuasively show that they were not finely tailored.
MR» WARD:

Well, with respect to the ~

QUESTION:

Male and female.

■■

~

MR0 WARD:

Certainly, in terms of the military re­

strictions, they are not very well tailored, and that leads
to the fact that this statute should essentially be treated
as an explicit distinction between males and females In terms
of its effec

of excluding women from public service jobs.

QUESTION:

But you made two points of saying that

foreseeability isn’t enough»

One is you said there is a

difference between Inevitability and foreseeability, and,
secondly, you say if the governing body has a history of
treating males and females differently, you look especially
closely at ite

I submit to you that both of those arguments

would condemn all the federal veterans’ preference legisla­
tion

40
MRo WARD:

They would then —• not necessarily con­

demn them, Your Honor, it would make us conclude that they
also constituted deliberate discrimination against women.
But as the amicus brief for the Department of Defense showed,
the U.S. Civil Service Commission study of the effect upon
women of a point system shows that it has a much less sig­
nificant impact on women, and in terms of whether or not this
statute does particularly meet its goals» when you bear in
mind that this statute originally was passed back in the days
in the 19th century when the assumption was that women would
not be looking for upper level jobs, and when you look at the
specific statutes and you see the requisitioning policy —
QUESTION:

They weren’t looking for stenographic

jobs either3 do you remember?
MR,, WARD:

They —

QUESTION:

Do you remember?

Only men could run

those machinesp women couldn’t run them.
MRo WARD:

That’s right., Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Women couldn’t run them.

MR* WARD:

Except there is evidence in the record

that shows that right about the time In the early — the end
of the 19th century and the beginning of this century, the
Commonwealth was at least starting to realise that perhaps
some women could run those stenographic machines, and that is
why they carved out and didn't apply the preference and they

41
tried to so-called protest women’s jobs0

The clear history

of this civil service system is a history of expressed de­
liberate distinctions between male jobs and female jobs, and
running along with that history was a decision to have an
absolute preference«,
QUESTION:

Well, if history alone is enough to con­

demn any law that has any sort of a discriminatory impact
against women, and if history alone is enough to show intent,
then any law passed by any state would be constitutionally
invalid because up until fairly well along in this century
no state allowed women to vote»
MR. WARD?

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart,, and

that is why we don3t say that the fact that this statute was
passed in the 19th century is in and of itself enough to
condemn it*

We add that specific legislative history, the

administrative history to the fact that the manner of using
this preference, incorporating wholesale the military's
discrimination renders the statute essentially one which ex­
plicitly distinguishes between males and females in terms of
who in fact will receive jobs in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and that is the way the statute works.

It

works as if you had incorporated all the military discrimin­
ation in terms of entry

level into the military right into

the public employment system.

This runs with a history of

explicit distinctions between the sexes for seventy-five

H2
years in terms of the hiring and requisitioning policies.
QUESTION;
tinction ^

You say it runs with the explicit dis­

Do you think that the Massachusetts legislature

when It passed Its Veterans’ Preference Act thought this
will be another good vray to keep women in their place9 or do
you think It thought we want to do something for the people
who have been veterans?
MR. WARD;

Your Honor,, obviously the ultimate pur-

pose was to drive some aid or help in some way to veterans.
That was the ultimate purpose.

Okay»

But as this Court has

recognised, there are various factors that detrmine the de­
cision and constitute motivating factors.

And if you express

It in terms of a desire to get women or to harm women9 we all
shrink back»

That is not discrimination®

Products of a male

dominated society are not going to want to harm women»
What In fact happened3 Mr® Justice Rehnquist, back
there in the 19th century is that the legislature assumed
that women either would not or should not be Interested in
upper level jobs®
QUESTION:

I was talking about the Veterans'

Preference Act.
MR® WARD;

Yes.

QUESTION;

Was that passed In the 19th century?

MR. WARD;

It was passed9 the first one in 188^ and

the one that parallels the one we have now was passed in 1896,

I}3

And when they passed it, Mr„ Justice Rehnquist, what they did
was they basically said this preference will not apply to
jobs especially calling for women»

The statutes on their

face throughout the years show expressly a desire to dis­
tinguish between men and women because women's jobs could be
protected* again based on the stereotype that turomen should
not or would not be looking for upper level jobs»

That is

where, if you are going to get into subjective motivation,
this history literally leaps out at you and shows that
Massachusetts intended and has continued to intend to deal
differently with males and females under the stereotype that
there are women's jobs and there are male’s jobs.
QUESTIONS

Of course, that isn't the approach that

the District Court took, is it?
MRo WARD:

The District Court relied basically, Mr,

Justice White, on the objective evidence»
QUESTION:

I know, but the answer is no, that was

not their approach?
MR, WARD:

Well, they certainly were aware of it»

It was argued, and in a footnote in the last decision they
show that it at least suggested —
QUESTION:

But that isn't the way they arrived at

their intent.
MR„ WARD:

No, it is not. Your Honorc

QUESTION:

Would it be foreseeable that thia Act

would exclude a great many handicapped, disabled people?

MRo WARD:

Yes, it would. Your Honor, because they

again, through no fault of their own, were not allowed Into
the military, and it would0
QUESTION:

And also, as I suggested to your

colleague, it would certainly exclude foreseeably most of the
people over age

or 50?

MR, WARD:

And looking at the fact that it is mostly

young persons that go in, it in one sense would in terms of
the persons who obtain a preference in terms of what age
they were when it was most likely that you would go into the
service,
QUESTION:

So that the consequence of this, in terms

of Impact, is not limited to women, it hits a great many
categories of people, does it not?
MR, WARD:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but

women are the most severely affected because virtually all
women are non-veterans.

Non-veteran is the inferior classi­

fication here —
QUESTION:

Well, all disabled, handicapped people,

all, not most, are —
MRc WARD:

Well, that's true, but two-thirds of the

non-veterans. Your Honor, are women, and virtually all women
are non-veterans.
QUESTION:

Does It make any difference whether the

category or group against whom discrimination is asserted is
a small group or a large group?
MRo WARD:

No, Your Honor, but the group asserting

it, Mrs. Feeney happens to be a member of a class of women
and that is the one that is before the Court»

The handicapped

may well have an equally compelling argument under the equal
protection clause.

Vie deal here with the facts of the ease

of a woman, and we are looking at the standards applied by
this Court»
So to summarize, basically we would feel that the
wholesale Incorporation of the military's discrimination
against women into the public employment system, combined with
the inevitability of the exclusionary effect virtually totals
—■ Judge Campbell below said it constitutes a mere blanket
exclusion of women from the whole segment or a major segment
of employment, and it goes a long way towards making upper
level public employment in Massachusetts a male preserve»
Based on those two objective factors and the legis­
lative history, we think clearly that this is at least a
deliberate and purposeful discrimination against women.

And

when we turn now to the question of what is the appropriate
standard, and we look to tt.e standard that has been applied
by this Court in cases involving discrimination against women,
we see that the Court ask;; whether or not the classification
served an important governmental

objective and whether or

not the means chosen to substantially relate it to the
achievement of those objectives,,
And the one question the Commonwealth could not
answer when asked below, and the one question that the
Commonwealth does not address itself to here is why have such
an extreme form of preference, an absolute and permanent one,
one that lasts throughout a veteran*s lifetime and gives
women virtually no chance, no matter how much ability is
shown by an individual woman, does not give any of those
women a chance for any of these upper level jobs.

And that

is the question we have to ask ourselves»
This is not a ease of any preference, simply a head
start, but we are challenging this form as an extreme form of
preference in which only a handful of states have a similar
type of preference.

Most states, of course, have the more

modest point preference»
And when you look at the profit goals offered by
the state, we see that this particular form of preference
does not well serve those goals.

First, we hear from the

Attorney General and from the Commonwealth in their brief a
lot of solicitude about readjustment back to civilian life,
a lot of solicitude for the recently discharged veteran.
When we look at the absolute and permanent form of
preference, and we ask what does it do for the recently dis­
charged veterans, and again if we look at Exhibit ?, the

administrative assistant list* x*je see that it does very
little for the discharged veteran»

In fact, of the 96 veterans

on the two major lists, Exhibits 7 and 9» the administrative
assistant list and the other longer list, the counsel list,
we find that 40 of the veterans were discharged in the 1940’s,
20 in the 1950's, and 15 in the I9605s»

Only 3 of the top 25

on the eligible list for administrative assistant had been
discharged within five years of service9 because it such an
extreme preference» so broad, a permanent preference»

It

tends in fact to reward or to give benefit to the persons
who are longest out ©f the service.

It also gives them addi­

tional benefit in terms that they rank relatively higher
within that preference category than their most recently
discharged veterans, in that the scores are also a function
of how much training and experience you have®

So the longer

you are out of the service, the higher score you will have.
On those two lists, the average year of discharge
was 1956g a full 19 years before the establishment of the
lists.

So when we look at this extreme form of preference,

we see that it does not really well serve the veteran most
in need of some readjustment assistance.

And as the Common­

wealth has po5,nted out, it is also the fact that a lot of
veterans can't pass the test»

These are the persons that

logically are most in need of some readjustments»
QUESTION;

What is the definition of veteran in

Massachusetts?
I©, WARD;

It is very broad, Your Honors and it in­

cludes anyone that served during the period between 19^0 and

1975» for most of that period simply a minimum of 90 days,
and during about nine of those years a period of 180 days.
So It Is extremely broad»

And in terms of the other rationales

the -QUESTION;

Including periods when there were no

military activities going on?
MR» WARD:

That's right.

It sweeps broadly.

Again,

It is an extreme form of preference, not well tailored to any
of the profit goals»

There is certainly no evidence whatso­

ever that the profit goal of encouraging enlistment9 if that
is a particularly Important interest to a state, Is served at
all3 no factual rationale»
And in terms of the broadly stated reward rationale,
we simply say with regard to that, that Is a broad statement
of a goal,

There has to be some limit when you say that your

goal is simply to reward veterans»

For example, the state

couldn't really say that only veterans could practice law in
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or only the children of
veterans.

There has to be some limit.

And when we look at

the —
QUESTION:

You are not9 as I understand it at least,

4

attacking the veterans5 preference as such.

Your claim on

behalf of your client isn't that she is a non-veteran but,
rather, that she is a woman, is that correct?

here,

MR, WARDs

That's correct. Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Isn't that right?

MR., WARD;

And the effect on women is invidious

It violates the basis concept of our system, that

burdens should be imposed based on some wrongdoing or in­
dividual responsibility.

Or as this Court recognised in

Frontier©, what the effect of this Is by excluding women as
a class, it invidiously relegates the entire class of females
to
QUESTION;

But the excluded class is not .just women,

MR, WARD:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Isn't it equally invidious on the non­

no.

veteran male?
MR, WARD:

Not equally, given the history of dis­

crimination against women, particularly in employment,
QUESTION;

Well, the economic impact is the same on

a non-veteran male.

MR, WARD:

It works the same on other non-veterans,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

I am asking whether or not there is any

such claim in this case.
MR, WARD:

I am making the claim for Helen Feeney

QUESTION:

And the class of females to which she

suffered a long history of discrimination and that the Job
market has been particularly inhospitable to women seeking any
but the lowest jobs»
from the men,,

That is what distinguishes the women

The men have not been Invidiously discriminated

against in employment.

In here9 Massachusetts perpetuates the

very stereotypes that constituted the premise upon which this
«

statute was passeds women should be in women8s jobs and men
should be in men's jobs.

And while they have removed some of

the more express discrimination, the effect of this statute
and its original design and premise produces the exact same
result9 women could not obtain jobs of interest to men and
they are necessarily perpetuating the stereotype as to what
jobs males should obtain and what jobs females should obtain
In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts»
We believe that it goes much too far and it con­
stitutes invidious discrimination and we ask the Court to
strike it down»
Thank you very much.
