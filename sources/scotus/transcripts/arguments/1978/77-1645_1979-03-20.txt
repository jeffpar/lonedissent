ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M, ANDERSONa ESQ.9
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, ANDERSON:

Thank you.

Mr, Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
The case now before the Court, Transamerica Mortgage
Advisors v. Lewis, presents a narrow technical question of law
and a broad important question of judicial policy.

The

question of law presented is whether section 206 of the

Investment
action.

Advisers Act of 1940 affords a private right of

The question of judicial policy presented is whether

this Court should imply a private right of action under the
Advisers Act and then leave to further litigation resolution
of such questions as who may bring the action, who may be the
defendant, who may be sued for what breaches of what duties,
as v?e 11 as questions of reliance, causation and intente
This Court Is being asked to interpret a statute,
but

I submit that it is being asked in a larger sense to

assess its role in the application of the federal securities
laws.

This Court is not being asked to deny relief to those

clients of investment advisers who have been victims of the

advisers9 deceit or negligence.

Ample federal and state

remedies already exist for the redress of grievances by clients
of investment advisers.
This Court is not being asked to read the Investment
Act narrowly or restrlctively, in violation of the principle
announced in the Brouk case.

We do simply urge that this Act

be read as it was written by the Congress and it has been
amended„
The facts of this ease briefly are as follows;

The

ease came to court in April 1973 with a 3uit by the plaintiff
and respondent Harry Lewis asking legal and equitable relief
for alleged violations of the Investment Advisers Act.

The

lawsuit was case as both a derivative action on behalf of
Mortgage Trust of America, a real estate investment trust, and
as a class action on behalf of the shareholders of Mortgage
Trust of America,
The petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for
failure to state a claim and argued that since Mortgage Trust
of America was and is a mortgage lender which does not deal
in securities within the meaning of the federal securities
law, it -was not subject to the Investment Advisers Act of 19^0,
that further, since Transamerica Mortgage Advisors is not a
public investment adviser in any sense of those words, it is
not subject to the Act.

We further argued that the respondent

had failed to make proper demand on the trustees of Mortgage

5
Trust of America.

And finally we argued that the Advisers

Act does not afford a private right of action in any events
The District Court noted that the petitioners®
arguments all had what were called substantial merits but ruled
that since the Advisers Act does not afford a private right of
action* there was no need to decide the other arguments ad­
vanced.
On appeals petitioners again argued that the Investmenf Advisers Act does not apply to the petitioners or the
facts in this case,, and that there is no private right of
action in any event.
QUESTION;

Is there a question of whether or not

there is a private right of action or whether or not there is
a private right of action for money damages?
MR. ANDERSON;

The question is whether or not there

is a private right of action»

The question as originally posed

in the petition for cert9 Mr0 Justice Stewart* was whether or
not there was a private right of action»
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR» ANDERSON;

In preparing the brief, we narrowed

tie question to x^hether it was a private right of action for
money damages.
QUESTION;

And thereby incurred the attack from

your adversary.
MR» ANDERSON:

That is correct.

The reason for the

6
narrowing of the question, which I believe to be proper within
the meaning of the Court’s rules, was that the Court of
Appeals decision which is in question here, in the Ninth
Circuit, was based on and simply incorporated the decision of
the Second Circuit in a case called Abrahamson vc Pleschner,
'That case was devoted exclusively to the consideration of
whether or not there was a private right of action for damages
Equitable issues were not present in that case, or equitable
claims were not present, and for that reason we narrowed it.
We narrowed it also because much of the claims for equitable
relief In this case seemed to be moot© and for that reason we
deemed that to be the issue; nonetheless we, as Mr, Justice
Stewart suggested, incurred the wrath of our opponents in

their brief and for that reason in our reply brief we address
the problem across the board broadly, both equitable and legal
relief.
QUESTION:

And that is the question as described in

your petition for certiorari?
MR0 ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And you agree now that that is the ques­

tion before the Court?
MR0 ANDERSON:

Yes, Mr0 Justice Stewart, that is the

question that is before the Courte
Returning to the chronology of events that bring us
here, on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit-

8
dichotomy there?
MR, ANDERSON:

It may suggest thats but I think a

reading of the Act as a Tfhole suggests that, and particularly
the language which follows the expression "suits In equitya"
Mr, Justice Rehnquist, suggest that that is because the Act
as a whole is geared to enforcement by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and that Commission being given broad
powers to seek injunctive reliefs and I think that is the
reason for that particular provision in the Aets a point
which I will stress later in this argument,
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be more likely that the

public authority would seek the equitable relief than private
in the general rule of cases?
MR. ANDERSON:
case.

Yes, I think that is probably the

However, I do not believe that the limitation of the

language to suits in equity suggests that the Congress meant
to imply a right to equitable relief.
site.

I think quite the oppo­

I think that, as suggested by some of the legislative

history —
QUESTION:

Congress intended to create a private

right of action- for equitable relief,
MR. ANDERSON:

That's correct.

That's correct, Mr.

Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

It clearly is a provision for suita for

equitable relief brought by the enforcing agency.

9
MRo ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

That ia correcto

In any event, you feel we have to decide

the equitable feature here?
MRo ANDERSON:
the Court.

Yes.

The equitable issue is before

It is a prayer or an aspect of the prayer in the

complaint which was filed in this case, and as counsel for the
respondent correctly point out, It is an aspect of the prayer
or of the relief which they sought, and so I think it is
properly before the Court.
QUESTION:

That isn’t my question0

My question is

do we have to decide it.
MR, ANDERSON:

Since the issue before the Court is

whether there is an implied right of action encompassing both
legal and equitable relief? the answer would be yes0

I think

the answer is that it has to be decided by the Courtc
QUESTION:

And yet your question presented in your

own brief is this, may a private right of action at law for
damages be Implied under the Investment Advisers Act.
MR» ANDERSON:

Yes, Mr» Justice Blackraun.

The

reason for that again was because In the decision which was
subject to appeal here, namely the Ninth Circuit decision In
this case, simply incorporated a Second Circuit decision in
the ease called Abrahamson v. Fleschner, and in that
particular —

I am familiar with that case, and I am

QUESTION:
place?

I

don’t want to —

Why should we decide this in the first

Why shouldn’t we send it back?
MR» ANDERSON:

I, don’t want to be presumptuous to

suggest what the Court has to do»

It i my view that the

question of both legal and equitable relief is before the
Court.
QUESTION:

Well, there isn't any compulsion on the

Court to treat them on an all or nothing basis, is there?
MR. ANDERSON:

No, Mr» Chief Justices 1 think there

is not such compulsion,

Howevers it would seem to me that to

the extent that we are here seeking to solve problems that
it might be helpful to litigants at large if there were some
indication of the Court’s views on the subject of ~
QUESTION:

And in your submission,, no valid distinc­

tion can be made?
MR» ANDERSON:

I believe that to be the case.

I

think, for examples here that the problem that might be
pointed out by that kind of distinction is illustrated by
this very case in which the respondent seeks

rescissionary

rights and incidental damages, and it seems to me that that
sort of runs together the Issue to such an extent that it
would be very difficult if we tried to separate them out.

11
QUESTION:

Is not. the equitable moot?

MR. ANDERSON:

The equitable relief entails in the

first instance a prayer that an advisory contract be enjoined
from renewal or enforcement.

It has in fact been renewed

since the beginning of this litigation and there has been no
effort to seek, preliminary or interim relief by the
respondents, so I take it that it is moot to that extent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson, isn’t it also true that both

equitable and legal claims were asserted and the District
Judge dismissed the entire complaint?
MR. ANDERSON:

That is correct.

That is correct.

And it is also true that in the Ninth Circuit decision, the
court talks of both legal and equitable relief, notwithstand­
ing

the fact that

it

waa

simply incorporating the decision or

ruling of the Second Circuit in the Abrahamson case.
In the appeal to the Ninth Circuit, we argued again
that the facts of this case do not lend themselves to applica­
tion of the Advisers Act in any event and that there was no
private right of action.

The Court of Appeals declined to

decide ;he other Issues advanced and with one judge dissenting
ruled that the Implication of a private right of action for
irjunctive relief and damages under the Advisers Act in favor
of appropriate plaintiffs is necessary to achieve the goals of
Congress in enacting the legislation.
The Court of Appeals opinion, as I indicated, simply

12
adopts wholesale the opinion of the Second Circuit, both the
majority opinion and the dissenting opinion in the ease of
Aforahamson v. Pleschner.
Now, it seems to me that the resolution of this case
entailed3 first* consideration of the special wording of the
Advisers Act*

And I want to stress that the Advisers Act is

unique among all the federal securities acts in the grant of
jurisdiction, not simply in limiting to the question of actions
— the elimination of the expression ’’actions at law,” but in
the phrase which follows that, and I wish to emphasize this
because it has not been the matter of extended treatments in
the brief, but in the Advisers Act the jurisdiction is con­
ferred E’of all suits in equity to enjoin any violation of the

Act."

It

does not

confer

jurisdiction over actions at law or

actions other than suits in equity to enjoin.

All of the

other federal securities laws, the *33 Acst, the '3^ Act, and
the other securities acts in question, all refer to jurisdic­
tion of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to
enforce any liability or duty created.

There is a signifi­

cant and I believe to be important distinction in the nature
of the jurisdiction which is conferred between the 1?40 Act
and the 1933 and the 1931? Acts in particular.
The second matter which I believe must be resolved
here is the consideration of the factors pointed out in the
Court’s 1973 opinion In the case of Cort v. Ash, in which the

13
Court specified or suggested factors to be considered in de­
termining whether or not an Act not expressly providing
private right of action would nonetheless afford implication.
In doing that kind of analysis, which I do not in­
tend today to belabor, it seems to me that the most important
aspect of that is attention to the legislative history.

The

legislative history of the Investment Advisers Act belies any
suggestion that Congress thought initially or has thought
since that it ought to be the basis for private right of
action.
And finally I would submit that the Court ought to
consider the results that would follow if this Court were to
Imply a private right of action under the Advisers Act.
The original legislation in 19^0 began with an SEC
bill which contains standard jurisdictional language which
included reference to jurisdiction over suits In equity and
actions at law, the same language that was in the 1933 and
the 193^ Acts.

Following negotiation and hearing, a comprom­

ise was reached and arranged on various aspects of the bill,
and one of the changes made was that the language "actions at
law'1 with respect to duties and violations of the Act was
eliminated, and we now have the statute which Is before us
which refers only to suits in equity, to enjoin any violation
of the Acte
Secondly — and there is another important

distinction — from its inception in 1940, the investment
Advisers Act has never had any provisions for express civil
liability.

Unlike the 1933 Act and unlike the 1934 Act, the

Investment Advisers Act does not provide any express liability
in any of its provisions.

In I960, the Advisers Act was

amended and the Securities and Exchange Commission was given
additional enforcement powers, but the grant of jurisdiction
or the limitation of jurisdiction, if you will, was not changed»
It remained the same.
And in 1970 there was I believe to be the most im­
portant and direct announcement by the Congress as to the
meaning or intention with respect to the Advisers Act, when
the Congress added a private right of action to the companion
statute — that is the Investment Company Act of 1940 •— and
they added an expressed private right of action to that legislatlon and further specified in adding that expressed right
of action who may be the plaintiff, who may be the defendant,
the nature of the duty that would be violated giving rise to
the action, they allocated the burden of proof, they estab­
lished evidentiary standards, and finally they prescribed, the
damages which may be recovered»

This was all done In 1970,

at a time when amendments were being made to both the Invest­
ment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act.
No creation of express civil liability, no creation
of an express private right of action was had under the
\

15
Advisers Act even though it was done very specifically and
deliberately under the Investment Company Act®
QUESTION:

Well, was it proposed?

MR. ANDERSON:

It was proposed by the SEC at various

times, Including in 1970, but there was no action taken on it
and, as my colleague,, the attorney for the respondents, reminds
us^ we are not to make much of silence, I gather®

But the

fact is that it has been proposed and was most recently pro­
posed as a matter of act in 1976 by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and there has been no action taken on it.
I would like to turn now, if I may. to the results
that would, follow if this Court were to imply private right of
action®

Because of the special warding of the Investment

Advisers Act, it would create at a minimum a hornets nest of
litigation because it cannot help but create a series of un­
answered questions.
The Investment Advisers Acts section 206, the basis
fcr the claim of an implied right of action in this case,
refers bo wrongdoing against clients of investment advisers
or prospective clients*
"prospective clients."

The key words, of coursea are
And the first question that must come

to mind Is what is meant by prospective clients®

I submit

that the use of that phrase is consistent with conferral of
authority and jurisdiction on the Securities and Exchange
Commission to seek relief against investment advisers who are

16
soliciting business, going after business.

It is 1 think

equally Inconsistent with the notion that from that could be
implied a right, a private right of action, the first question
being, of course, who are prospective clients of investment
advisers.
QUESTION:

Well, that would be equitable relief only,

wouldn’t it?
MRe ANDERSON:

It might — yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

it may suggest equitable relief only, but I think it raises
the problem which this Court addressed in the Blue Chip
Stamps case, namely who are this class of people who might be
clients of the investment advisers»

And, it seems to me that

the use of prospective clienta belies any suggestion that it
was Intended that this Act confers jurisdiction on people who
could claim that they might have been a client of the invest­
ment adviser if they had but known what good advice or what
bad advice he was going to give*

I mean, it seems to me that

it simply creates an open-ended class of plaintiffs without
limits, as Judge Gurfein suggested in his dissent in the
Abrahamson case®
QUESTION:

Mr® Anderson, on that point, as 1 recall

the beginning of your argument, you said there were state and
federal remedies available to clients of investment advisers
who had been defraudeda
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, sir

17
QUESTION:

What are the federal remedies that are

available to clients?
MR. ANDERSON:

Mr. Justice Stevens, the most obvious

one that would coma to mind would be that in the event a
client of an investment adviser purchased stock and in con­
nection with that purchase the Investment adviser had acted
intentionally deceitful with respect to representations about
the stock. It would seem to me that the client would have a
claim under rule 10(b) or rule 10(b)(5) under the 193*5 Act*
QUESTION:

I see*

They don't have a remedy for

violation of section 206 though or whatever the number of
this is?
MR® ANDERSON:

The question, of course?, before the

Court in whether or not they would have if you Imply private
N

right of action.
QUESTION:

Yes®

MR® ANDERSON:

1 am suggesting that there is a

remedy, there is a remedy available «*QUESTION:

For violations other than the ones that

are alleged in this complaint?
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct*

For violations of other provisions of

the Act*
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

That’s right*

I see

18
MR. ANDERSON:

And It is significant, Mr® Justice

Stevens, that in this case there is no allegation of a purchase
or sale9
QUESTION:

Right*

MR. ANDERSON:

We are dealing instead with a fact

situation which has been characterized at the conclusion of
the complaint as being by its nature fraudulent,, deceitful or
in violation of the Act.
The second result of implying a private right of
action here Is to leave open the question of prospective de­
fendants*

Section 206 speaks of those who aid or abet

in the

familiar language, and therefore I submit that the question
not only is open as to who may sue but who may be a defendant»
It leaves open also the question of reliance and causation,
and it leaves open the question of intent which this Court
dealt with in the Hochfelder ease9
Now, the potential reach of a private action under
the Advisers Act is illustrated by this very ease®

It is

alleged here that the adviser to a real estate Invesment trust
has violated the Advisers Act.

There is no allegation that

the wrongdoing occurred in connection with the purchase or
sale of any securities, there is n© allegation that the acts
of the trustee-petitioners constituted willful deception,
there in no allegation here of intentional concealment of any
material fasts„

The complaint simply constitutes a description

19
of facts, facts which were revealed and In fact reported to
the SEC in registration statements and then characterised as
being in violation of the Act under section 206S
I would submit that in the considerations of whether
©r not the language lends itself to implication of a private
right of action, the Court be mindful of the fact that if a
private right of action were to be implied in this ease, it
would open the door to the avoidance of the limitations on
private security actions which have been recognized by this
Court, limitations with respect to whether or not there was a
purchase or sale, a limitation recognized in the Blue Chip
Stamps case»

It would permit disregard, of the requirement

that the plaintiff allege and prove intent to defraud and
dfccoive

a limitation recognised in the Hoehfelder casee

It

would permit disregard of the requirement that there be willful deception, not Just breach of fiduciary duty, a limitation
recognised in the Santa Pe Industries v„ Green case.
I reserve the remaining timee
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr* Keisman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP ERIC Lc KEISMAN, ESQ9,
OM BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR3 KEISMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In sharing our time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, we will concentrate on all aspects of the case

20
except the third of the Oort v. Ash criteria, the necessity
or the importance of supplementation of government activity,
which area will be covered primarily by the government in
the time it has to argue.
We would like to start first by reidentifying this
ease.

The complaint in this action is primarily and always

was a classic bill inequity, seeking a declaration of voidness
of a contract between an investment adviser and the advisee,
to wit the Mortgage Trust of America, which we have called in
our brief MTAS

It also seeks restition of the consideration

paid under that contract on the grounds that the contract was
at all times in violation of the Investment Advisers Act of
19^0, including section 20S, and of course that relief arises
under 215(b) of the Act, providing that contracts in violation
of the Act or practices under contracts in violation of the
Act are void.
This is the primary relief sought in this action
and always was.

Mow, the respondent has said some of this is

moot because we never sought preliminary relief, even though
the contrast has been renewed.

It is rather difficult to move

for prelirainary injunction on the basis of the complaint that
has been dismissed for want of

subject matter jurisdiction»

The equitable relief sought Is in no sense moot, it is the
gravamen of the action®
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled

21
very narrowly and quite properly*
that was before it.

It reached only the issue

The District Court had dismissed the

complaint for want of subject matter of jurisdiction, finding
that there was no private right of action under the Advisers
Act, no matter how cast, and the Court of Appeals disagreed
and therefore it reversed and said that in the proper ease
there could be a private right of action for injunctive
reliefs equitable relief ©r damages* and it got no farther.
It adopted the rationale of Abrahamson but, of
course, Abrahamson is the very, very different ease.
Abrahamson was a suit that could only be characterised as a
suit for damages arising out of participation in a hedge fund,
and this Court denied certiorari in that case*; in Abrahamson.
And as we have said In our brief, we respectfully contend
that this would be a peculiar case and a most peculiar record
in which to attempt to relitigate Abrahamson»
QUESTION:

Well, what Intimation do you draw from

our denial of certiorari in Abrahamson?
MR. KEX3MAN:

I draw, I believe, Mr., Justice

Rehnqulet, no Improper intimation.

It holds nothing»

It

holds I believe only that the Court did not consider that
case of sufficient Importance to warrant at the time its

review.
QUESTION:

As Justice Frankfurter used to say, four

justices didn’t vote to grant»

22
MR. KEISMAN:

Quite so, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst.

What

I am saying here, however, is that this is not Abrahamson and
the petitioners to a certain degree seem to stress that they
would like to relitIgate all the questions In Abrahamson, but
those questions aren’t here.
money damages,

This is not a suit primarily for

This suit does not raise the question of

whether in order for there to be subject matter jurisdiction
this Court must allow an action cast in law.

This is not to

say that we don’t think it is proper to imply such an action.
And I will get within the next couple of minutes to the ques­
tion of whether anything at all, much less anything important,
is to be drawn from whatever happened to section 21H of the
Advisers Act in the few weeks that it was not considered by a
committee but presented willy-nilly to the floor

after some

other rapid redrafting®in. the summer of 19^0,
But at the very least, the very least we say that a
'hili' In equity, which is what this ease is, lies.

Now, we

agree that the Cort v. Ash criteria, that is at least the
Commission and I agreed to east our argument along those lines,
;V

-

Now, we think the first of the criteria expressed
by this Court, whether the statute in question was passed for
the special benefit of a particular class of persons, and
whether as this Court itself explained that, that means
whether it creates a federal fight.

And we think that in

this instance that the Advisers Act creates a federal right

23

on behalf of the clients of investment advisers within the
context of the advisory relationship.

This is obvious and

manifest and we are not going to belabor what is in our brief.
This Court itself in the Capital Research Bureau
case analysed the meaning based on thata with the passage of
the Advisers Act, nothing has happened in the interim to
change that analysiss

Congress a s concerned about the rela­

tionship inter se se between the adviser and the client
advisee.

It was not concerned In passing the Advisers Act,

with all due respect to the petitioners, with the purchase
and sale of securities by the adviser on behalf of -the advisee»

fa

It was concerned and It was seriously concerned with the rerelationship inter se se*

.

:

On© of the things In the legislative history, perhaps
yferjJi significant in this case, was that one of • the things
Congress expressed its concern about in both the Senate report
and the House report was the kind of compensation arrangements
ithat advisers dealt for themselves with their advisees®
they, as the SEC had warned

Were

in its 1939 study, dealing them­

selves compensation arrangements which encouraged them to go
out and take untoward risks.

The most common in those days

were; contingent ones which are, of course, prohibited as to
registered advisers*

More common today or yesterday in the

rather rrlef era of the assendency of the real estate Invest­
ment trust was the compensation contract based at least in part

upon undispersed commitments which encouraged the practice of
heavy forward committing, borrowing short to lend long, and
Incurring reverse leverage so that in order to expand your fee
base you borrowed money for more than you could get for it if
you had committed it sufficiently.

Of course, much of that is

no longer Important In the Investment community, but the inter
se se relationship, the way a compensation arrangement is d@signed was definitely a concern in both houses of Congress, or
at least the cognisant committees in 1939 and 19^0.
i

Now, the special benefit, well there was n© other
beneficiary of this Act except, of course, for the sovereign
interest in the integrity of securities markets and the health
of the capital markets«

reports., in the hearings, in Senator Wagner's statements was
to protect the investors.

This is obvious.

What form of

remedy Shey might seek is no part of the question,- much less
the answer®
One© a federal right Is created, it is nothing un­
common for the legislature to leave the method of its protec­
tion to the courts.

We contend that it has long been accepted

by legislatures that the special genius for designing remedy
is judicial.

Vey often the legislative attempt, to foresee

what kinds of violations of the general terms of the statute

25
will occur.
QUESTION:

You say one© that the federal right has

been created, do you mean once the federal private right has
been created or just ones a federal prohibition has been
enacted?
MR® KEISMAN:

.1 begin with one® a federal prohibition®

1 am not trying to imply my conclusion in my premise, Mr»
Justice Rehnquist*

I am saying that a federal positive: 1'aw

enacted by the Congress says that practices that operate as a
fraud or deceit by advisors upon advisees®

When I went to law school it was con­

Now perhaps that difference has been blurred in the

ensuing years.
MR® KEISMAN;

I respectfully submit that this

Court's interpretation, its proper Interpretation of sections
like 213j> that is section 29(b) of the Exchange Act and the
Second Circuit's Interpretation of 26 of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act require a vast change in the law if we
are now to say, oh, n©„ all 215(b) means is it can be used
defensively.

It would also make the statute meaningless®

Are you talking about this Court's in­

terpretation of the last few years or over a period of a.

MR® KEISMANs

Well, the first statement of which I

am well aware, Mr® Justice Rehnqulst, is in Deckert which in
turn cites authority as to the meaning of these provisions in
the securities laws, and it says that they are voidable at

QUESTION:

Going back to the Safety Appliance Act

and so on®
MR. KEISMAN:

The Safety Appliance Act, Rigsby and,

of course, way back to Couch ve Steel and Dean Thayer's com™
mentaribs that when federal positive law Is created or any
positive law is created, saying such act ©r omission is
criminal or otherwise wrongful, as against such persons, then
it :\s the most natural thing in the world for the civil process
as well as the sovereign penal process to imply a remedy with
respect thereto to the party aggrieved®
Now, the petitioners here we think recognize this
because they mount a massive exegesis upon a thre@-»w©rd
omission from section 21^!, the special federal question

28
jurisdiction subsection»

As we believe we have developed,

perhaps too exhaustively in our brief9 section 214 has no
legislative history worthy of the name.

Section 214 as known

to the floors of the House and the Senate9 as described to it
in the committee reports that same to the floor* is described
as being comparable to the provisions contained in the Invest­
ment Company Act.

As a matter of fact, every section in

Title II of the Advisers Act after section 20? is so described
as comparable8
If a member of the Senate or a member of the House
were more than ordinarily curious he might have turned to the
legislative history of the Investment Company Act in the
Senate and House report on that which happened to be on his

desk In

Now* if the intent of Congress is the intent of

someone on some subcommittee9 then the reasonable interpre­
tation of the intent of the sovereign body of Congress with
respect to 214 is what it intended to do9 what it had done

committee reports and read the committee hearings9 there was
nothing in any of those that carried the remotest suggestion

There is no factual historical explanation that says
why at some point on some day 214 was drawn precisely the way
it was.

Historically the most rational is that for a long

time* as we went through the rapid spring and summer of 19^0
drafting these laws, large pieces of Title I and Title II,
the formal pieces., jurisdiction, venue, offensess procedures
had been picked up from the 1935 Act and put in bodily perhaps
as a way of^saving time.

At

point, the industry protested

that this bill was sloppy in effect®

This was what actually

happened. Title 1 and Title II should be separated, that
section should be written®

Rather quickly sections were

written and we have the committee print that pops up now with
sections all neatly done for Title I and Title II, with no
comment on any of them, not the slightest off the floor nor on.
Now, to create a monumental doetrind to 3&y that
the Advisers Act shall be different from all other acts because o ‘ this bit of draftsman’s trivia and against what the
floors of each house enacted in, this bill without substantially

being told is an excuse, It is not a valid reason for an

exegesis9 for a different result, for change of the conse­
quences of the broad anti-fraud provision of the Advisers Act

argument was recognised, that to put another weapon in the

hands of a company seeking to take over another, as it were
the predator, was to tilt the balance in a way different
than Congress had in mind.

The Williams Act was enacted

because the Congress expressed great concern at the rush of
cOiiipanios, conglomerates, aggressive corporations to take over
others, and the Williams Act- was passed, to make that a little
more difficult.
Now, If the predator as it were could sue not only
his competitor but as the logic appeared to be could sue the
target company If it fought back hard and slipped into some

to mount what the financial press used to call the Saturday

Mr, Ferrara.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH C. FERRARA, ESQff,

AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FERRARA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may It please

the Court:
The Securities and Exchange Commission believes that
an implied remedy for damages caused by violations of the anti­
fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act is consistent
with the Act’s legislative scheme and necessary to achieve
effectively its goals.
As you have already heard, a primary congressional
purpose underlying the enactment of the Investment Advisers
Act

particularly its anti-fraud provisions, was to eliminate

fraud and overreaching by investment advisers, abuses which
had compromised the interests of advisory clients and deroga­
tion of the delicate fiduciary nature of an advisory relation­
ship „
Judicial recognition of an implied right of action
hers:1 would effectuate that congressional goal.

Far from

interfering with the Actes regulatory scheme or its

35
enforcement by the Commission In the manner explicitly pro­
vided for in the statute,, section 206 — I'm sorry, implying
a right of action under section 206 of the Advisors Act would
serve as a necessary supplement to governmental action.

With­

out a private remedy, statutory objectives would be frustrated
and congressionally provided protections for advisory clients
would be significantly diminished.
Like section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange
Act,, section 206 of the Advisers Act is a general anti-fraud
provision, an across the board prohibition of the countless
varieties of deceptions and cunning devices to which clients
of investment

advisers might be subjected, and all who meet

the statutory definition of adviser, including those who are
exempt from registration by the Commission, are covered.
Section 206 is therefore a provision .intended and
structured by the legislators to provide broad protections to
the clients of investment advisers, to the clients of invest­
ment advisers.

Congress clearly articulated a federal right

and that a special class.
Becuase of this specific congressional purpose,
section 2GS in some respects is more limited to the anti-fraud
provisions of section 10(b) of the Exchange Act.

For example,

section 206 is limited in its applicability to an adviser's
relationship with his client.

On the other hand, the limita­

tions contained in section 10(b) that the fraud be in

36
connection with the purchase and sale of a security is not a
prerequisite since Congress recognised that fraud by an
adviser may take forms which do not alleys directly relate to
the purchase and sale of securities,, thus the legislative
history of the Act repeatedly emphasises the need to protect
the special class of clients from unscrupulous and fraudulent
practices*
By 19^0, of course, Congress had enacted a full
panoply of securities laws which were in part designed to pre­
vent fraudulent practices, yet Congress perceived a deficiency
in the legislative scheme in that it was not as effective as
it could be in preventing the types of abuses that had grown
up in the investment advisory field*

Congress intended to

remedy this deficiency and this Court has directed lower
courts that it is their duty to provide such remedies as are
necessary to effectuate the congressional purpose*
It is therefore significant to the Commission that
each of the three appellate courts that has considered the
issue presented here and the overwhelming number of district
i

>

courts that have done so have concluded that a private remedy
is both appropriate and necessary to achieve the goals under­
lying the Investment Advisers Act.

And as the Firth Circuit

has stated in the Wilson cases there are no less drastic and
more closely tailored means by which to do so*
We submit that the many courts that have considered

37
this issue have been faithful to the Court’s direction»

There

are, as this Court has pointed out, of course, circumstances
in which a private remedy would not only fail to contribute
to furthering the legislative scheme but would also actually
interfere with Congress’ intent»

But we do not have in these

circumstances, we do not have in this case an assertion of a
private remedy by

one

that the statute was meant to regu­

late as we had in the Piper case.

Here the clients of the

advisers were intended to benefit from the statute, and that
is who is bringing the action»

Nor do we have a situation

in which private enforcement would not be harmonious with
the exercise of the enforcement powers entrusted to govern­
mental agencies, as was the case in Amtrak and Barbour.
It has been the Commission's consistent experience
that even where allegations in a separate private damage
action parallel the Commission action in an enforcement pro­
ceeding, private remedies do not Interfere with their own
enforcement activities and, of course, many private actions
are brought where the Commission does not or because of
limited resources could not institute its own proceeding.
We recognise, of course, that administrative or
institutional limitations! alone do not justify the implica»
tlon of private remedies, but an appreciation of the dimen­
sions of the enforcement problems faced by the Commission and
how that problem has changed through the years is useful to

38
an understanding of the depths of the problems that are faced
today.
As in Broukj one measure of the necessity for a
private action is to provide — X should say is provided by
the scope of the practical problems that the agency faces in
attempting to administer the Act,

In X9^0a the investment

adviser industry was indeed a fledgling profession.

That

emerged in response to a depression and the public’s perceived
need for investment expertise to supervisors5 investments.
But that fledgling profession has experienced dramatic growth
since 1940, and recent statistics indicate that that is a
continuing trend.
In 1941, barely 750 advisers registered with the
Commission under the Investment Advisers Act, as compared to
approximately 6,000 broker-dealers that were registered with
the Commission back in 1941.

Currently the Commission5s

records put the number of registered investment advisers -and that is not the entire universe of advisers9 but the
number of registered investment advisers at 5,500, almost
equalling the number of registered broker-dealers.
Perhaps even more indicative of the importance of
the advisery industry to the nation’s affairs, of our
national economy is the growth of the assets under advise­
ment.

While the number of advisers increased seven-fold

since 19*119 the amount of assets under advisement has

39
increased fifty times.
advisement.

Today there are $200 billion under

And it must be taken into account that, unlike

overseeing and disciplining the broker-dealer community
where the Exchange Act provided for a Commission and selfregulatory partnership in enforcing the Act, the Commission
must bear the primary responsibility for regulating and en­
forcing the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act®
Moreover, the enforcement role, as I said a moment
ago, extends to all those who meet the definition of an
adviser, including the many advisers who are exempt from the
Act's registration provisions®
For various reasons not limited to the scarcity of
available resources, the Commission must carefully choose the
cases it brings®

Sven in those cases it does b3’ingfl moverover,

it is normally impossible for the Commission to obtain
redress for injured investors.

As Mr® Justice Stevens pointed

out, it is fundamental to our adversary system that selfish
interests of litigants provide the best guarantee that a claim
will be effectiveless asserted.

Certainly, it is true that

there is no policeman so effective as the one whose poekethoOk
is affected by the degree to which he enforces the law.
As we have pointed out, many of the reasons which
compel a conclusion that a private right of action should be
available under the Exchange Act also militate for the con­
clusion that a private action should be provided under the

Advisers Act.
QUESTION:

Do you draw any distinction between legal

and equitable claims?
MR. FERRARA:

Well, indeed, I suppose the Commission

would prefer to see the case decided on the narrowest grounds,
principally because we have been told and we understand that
implied actions are not favored.

However, I think that in

this case, although the relief prayed for is basically equit­
able; relief, damages are also prayed fer3 and we think prob­
ably this would be a good time to resolve the question of
whether there is an implied remedy under the Investment
Advisers Act,
QUESTION:

That doesn't quite answer my Brother

White's questions as 1 understood

QUESTION:

To put it differently» why should you get

a different and how could you get a different answer on the

legal side and on the equitable side In terms of the private

MR0 FERRARA:

Briefly3 we would follow the direction

of Mrc Chief Justice Burger in the Piper ease, where he asked
as one of the criteria that were utilized in that case If
there was a less drastic means by which to prov5.de the
remedies that were needed to fulfill the congressional purpose.
And Mr0 Justice Burger might say in analogy to the Piper case
that this is —
QUESTION:

How about the Commission?

MR. FERRARA:

We would agree that if the Court chose

a less drastic ~
QUESTION:

What do you urge the Court to do?

MR0 FERRARA:

We urge the Court to find that implied

right of action under section 206 of the Advisers Act 9 but
should the Court choose to find —
QUESTION:

For whata both legal and equitable?

MR. PERRARA:

For legal and equitable relief„

How­

ever
QUESTION: You think the Act should be construed that
way?
MR. FERRARA:

We do indeed,,

Howevers we recognize

that should the Court wish to find only that an equitable
remedy should be implied under section 206, it could do so.
QUESTION:

Remedies sometimes don’t put any money in

**3
anyone8s pocket3 Isn’t that ao?
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

Indeed they do not.

The Commission isn’t so much concerned

about putting money in people’s pockets as stopping wrong­
doing that is on-going, isn’t that right?
MR. FERRARA:

That’s correct.

We generally seek

prospective relief.
QUESTION:

But you told us that your argument Is

based upon the economic motivation of private parties.
MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

I9ni sorry?

A great deal of your argument is based

upon the fuel that is provided by the economic motivation of

MR. FERRARA:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And economic motivation has to do with

putting money in people’s pockets generally.
MR. FERRARA:

The protection of the economic inter­

ests of clients Is the very point of prohibitions against
adviser fraud.

Mr, Chief Justice, the Commission normally

seeks prospective equitable relief in getting an injunction.
A private litigant seeking equitable relief oftentimess as in
this ease, would seek rescission, restituion and accounting
and to some extent restitution as the equitable analogue, I
believe,, of damages.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ferrara, which If any of the four

factors identified in Oort v„ Ash would suggest that one could
draw distinction between legal and equitable remedies?
MR» FERRARA;

It would be the third, sir, that is

whether or not the action was consistent with the underlying
legislative scheme*

That is the way that —•

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting then that perhaps an

'}■

equitable action is consistent but a damage action might be
inconsistent?
MR* FERRARA;

No.

What I am suggesting is that in

providing a gloss over the four-part Cort test 5„n the Piper
case9 1 believe this Court suggested in focusing on Cort
factor three, that is where the action i.s consistent, this
Court asked an additional question and that is whether or not
the

action,

a

private

action could go forward in a leas

drastic fashion than to seek full legal damages*

And since

there was no response in that case, they found in part that
the third factor of the Cort test had not been met.
I think in this case, should the Court wish to take
that; approach, should the Court wish to provide that gloss of
Piper on Cort ve Ash, it could decide that at a minimum the
third degree or the third criteria of the Cort test could be
met by providing equitable relief.

However, we believe that

the Court should decide the broader question and that is
whether there is an implied right of action generally under
the Investment' Advisers Act

Mr. Anderson, don’t they appear in the

34 Act as those Acts have express actions at law

available for Remedy?
/

^R/ ANDERSON:
QUESTION:-

Yes, that9s correct.

However -»

There is no such express action at law

available under this statute.
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, that is correct.

However, in

46
the ’33 and '34 Acts where there are creations of expressed
rights ©f actions those provisions providing those expressed
rights of action create and have in them those very sections
conferral of jurisdictions and so it seems to me that the
significance is not the omission or the Inclusion for that
purpose but to suggest a broader range of remedies available.
There are a few number of suits against real estate
investment trusts because of the uncertainty as to whether or
not a private right of action exists under this Act®

That I

think is the answer to the fact that there are only some 15
suits that we have been able to find in recent years,

As the

Court may know9 the District Courts have been divided on this
issue and all of the Courts of Appeals which have considered
thiss there has been a strong dissent.
With respect to Judge Gurfein’s comment that there
might b@ equitable relief available, It should be pointed out
that equitable relief as an issue was not In that case, but
■J,

more Importantly I think it would be anomalous for this Court
to conclude that there might be equitable relief because the
existence of equitable relief presupposes under standard
equitable principles the existence or the absence of adequate
legal relief*

And I think it would be on that technical

legal ground, it would be inconsistent to do so.

But more

importantly, as we point out in this case, since there is a
prayer here for rescission, the line between equitable relief

*7
and money damages relief Is bound to be blurred.
The Securities and Exchange Commission refers to
the only other case in which this Court has considered the
Investment Advisers Act, namely the Capital Gains case.

In

the Capital Gains case, this Court held that the Commission
need not show intentional willful misconduct, old fashioned
fraud in order to obtain an injunction*

Are we to understand

from that that a private litigant seeking injunctive relief
also would not have to show old fashioned -fraud, intentional
conduct*

And if that is the case, does it not undermine

thin Court's ruling in the Hophfelder ease where the limita­
tion on the kind of conduct that could be prescribed.
The argument is made in this case that the Advisers
Act at least provides for equitable relief that 5a based on
section 215(b) of the Advisers Act, and as we submit and
discuss at length in the red reply brief9 that argument is
based on misreadings of that section and does not account for
the fast that that section was undoubtedly based on state
law in which the voidability provision was available as a
defense for someone seeking to enforce an adviser contract,
did not confer necessarily or by experience a right to
affirmative action-/
The Advisers Act, unlike the 1933 and 1934 Aetss
does not purport to regulate the marketing of securities
generally*

It is aimed at a small specific segment of the

securities Industry»

It is aimed instead at a special rela­

tionship rather than a range of transactions, and we submit
that to use 1933 and 193^ Act principles in wholesale inter­
pretation of the Advisers Act; simply because they are both
or all three are federal securities law Is misleading and
inappropriate, given their different aims and different
purposes®
Accepting the premise that the Advisers Act was
intended to protect clients of investment advisers, it.is
Ironic I think that if this Court were to imply a private
right of action under that Act, it would plunge those
litigants, those claimants, those clients of investment
advisers into years ©f unknown litigation -*» and I say unknown,

as

to who

may

bring the suit, who may be a defendant, who may

be shied, what are the standards for causation, and what are
the questions for intent®
How much more it would benefit the investors, how
much more it would benefit the clients of investment advisers
if the federal courts were to leave t© Congress the task ©f
weighing and considering those very questions, as the Congress
itself ;< id in 19?G in its evaluation of the Investment
Company Act.

It seems t© me that the beneficiaries of the

Act, namely the clients of Investment advisers, would benefit
more from refusing to imply a private right of action here
and allowing the Congress to weigh and to evaluate the

remedies before opening the door to witless protracted private
litigation in the federal courts.
Thank you®
