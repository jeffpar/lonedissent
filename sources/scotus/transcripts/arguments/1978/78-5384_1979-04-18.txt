We will hear arguments

Mr. Boggs, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BYRON W. BOGGS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOGGS5

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it pleas© the
4

Court s
The law cf this nation has always been that the
criminal defendant is entitled to the presumption of innocence.
This Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment
(_____ ._______

due process clause protects the criminal defendant against
conviction except on proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
as to each fact necessary to constitute the charge.
The Court has further held that the State carrying
this burden may not shift the burden to the defendant such as
by presumption.
QUESTION s

That has not prevented the courts generally

from holding that the possession—evidence of the possession
of recently stolen property, for example, permits a jury to
draw the inference that the possessor was also the thief, has
it?
MR. BOGGSs

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

But there is

a difference between permitting a jury to infer, and telling
them that they are to presume, or telling them that the law

4
presumes.
And the difference is critical to the right of a
trial by jury upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTSOMs

Mr. Boggs,

X3m sure that all of us \

trained as lawyers would probably agree with you that there is a
difference between tha statement that you may presume and you
may infer.

i
i

i
•
Do you think tha average jur«ar really gets much of a

difference between those two sentences?
MR. BOGGS:

I think that any juror or literate lay

person knows the difference between the word "may" and the
word "shall,” or the difference between the words "may infer,"
and the phrase "the law presumes."
I think they know there is a difference.

They might

differ as to exactly how they would describe that difference.
But in general, tha difference in those terms would be a
difference significant, and at th® heart, of the reasoning
process of the jury.
The "may infer," allowing them to read, as if you
were inviting them to read? the "shall" or the "law presumes"
phrase, prohibiting them from reasoning.
Petitioner was charged with th® crime of deliberate
homicide,

jhe crime of deliberate homicide under Montana law

has the elements t:hat the defendant shall have caused a death?
and that he shall have caused that death purposefully or

5
knowingly,,
And the Montana Supreme Court has said that those
terms , "purposely" or "knowingly" embody the concept mens re.
It stood admitted in the ease„ both by written
confession and by myself in open court, as petitioner9s attorney,
that there had been a death that had resulted as a consequence
of the acts of petitioner0
QUESTION%

You don't find any fault with that kind of

an instruction in a civil case, 2 take it, although that question
J

is not before us?
MR, BOGGSs

I would see no fault in the instruction

in a civil case, Mr» Chief Justice»

However, I would note

that the instruction as given in this case would not conform
with the Federal rules of evidence pertaining to civil trials»
As I read Rule 301,2 pertaining to civil trials, the
most that could be instructed under the circumstances of this
case was that the jury may infer the presumed fact.
But the fact is strictly aside from the argument that
I present to you, which is based ©n this Court's rulings as to
criminal trials and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The only

question in the case, if I may say, the reason for the jury's
being invited to the courtroom to listen to the evidence was to
determine the factual question as to the mental state of
petitioner at the time he engaged in .the fatal acts.
The question of whether he had acted purposely cr

6
knowingly was fairly raised by tha evidences, in the written
confession, which constituted the State’s case, together with
collaborating evidence.
While' admitting that the death had been caused by
the petitioner,, in no instance states that he intended to kill
*
v
her? that he wanted to kill her? that he knew she was dying.
Hot once is the word death mentioned.
The facts of the confession stood at the .basis for
the opinion of a psychiatrist and a psychologist, both of
v

-

whom had examined petitioner and had formed opinions concerning
his personality and intelligence, and had formed opinions as
to his mental state at the time of the fatal act.
And their opinions offered for the jury* s benefit
were that he had not intended to cause this death? that he did
not have the death in his view at thatftime.
QUESTION!

Mr. Boggs, let me taka you back once more

to the instruction which you complain of, which I guess is on
the bottom of page 5 of your brief:

the law presumes that a

person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary
acts,
What if instead of that th© court had instructed,
"you may infer that a person intends th© ordinary consequences
of his voluntary acts?91

Do you think there would foe any

constitutional question raised?
MR. BOGGS %

I don’t think so

7
Let me say in that regard that the instruction was
given in addition to €he instruction of which I complain which
said—and it’s instruction number nine on page 36 of the
AppendIk--purpose and knowledge are manifested by the circum­
stances connected with the offense»
not

Purpose and knowledge need

be proved by direct evidence* but may be inferred from

acts* conduct and circumstances appearing in evidence»
\

And 1 would say that that would be substantially the same
as the instruction you just phrased»
QUESTIONs

You would have no objection to instruction

number nine?
MR» BOGGS:

I have only ©n@ objection to it; it’s not

of constitutional dimensions.
The objection I have is the word "are” in the first
line rather than the word "may be/’
QUESTION s

6

Counsel * I take it that this crime could

have been proved if this jury found beyond a reasonable doubt
that he not only—that just knowingly* as distinguished from
purposely* caused this death?
MR. BOGGS %

Yes* knowingly in the sense that h® was

aware at that time—
QUESTION?

i
But this instruction—instruction number

five hasn’t really any connection with that.

Let’s assume that

the instruction had been that—to find the defendant guilty you
must find that he knowingly caused this death.

8

Instruction number five wouldn't bother you on that,
would it?
MR, BOGGS:
QUESTION:
,

MR. BOGGSs

Mr. Justice White.
QUESTIONS

Well—
Isn’t it just in connection with purpose?
It’s most clearly Identified with purpose,.
But it would bother me as to knowingly also.
Why would it”»

\

MR. BOGGS:
QUESTIONS

And for this reason-”
Well, I guess you can say that there was a

general verdict here, wasn’t there?
\

■MR. BOGGSs
QUESTIONS

Yes.
So you don’t know whether the jury found

purposely or knowingly.
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION?

That’s true.
And if they found purposely, you say this

instruction is fatal to the case.
MR. BOGGS:

That’s true.

But Mr. Justice White, if I

can pur sue that for a moment, the crime is deliberate homicide«
The verdict was guilty of deliberate homicide.
QUESTION:

That may be but the instructions told them

what it was.
MR. BOGGS:

But the official Code comment to the

section states that this section deals only with acts done
deliberately, that is, purposely ©r knowingly.
QUESTION:

Thatmay be, but that isn’t what the jury

9
was told.

And you don’t say that they told them wrong.
MR. BOGGSs

No, I don’t say that.

trying to say is this:

But what I’m

The concept of knowingly in the

context of deliberate homicide must surely b© that the indi­
vidual has an awareness that he is causing a death at the
«
time he is causing it in such circumstances as he might turn
away from the consequences.
QUESTION %

Well, you don't say--you say knowingly and

purposely, then, are the same?
MR. 30GGS;
QUESTION s

They are certainly related,
Well, they may foe, but they certainly—

the instructions define them separately,
MR. BOGGS:

Yes, but—

y

QUESTION; V The statutes define them separately,
MR. BOGGS;

I think they are two attempts at getting

at the same concept, albeit different avenues;.
QUESTION;

Doesn’t purposely have some connotations

of motivation to a greater extent that knowingly?
MR, BOGGS:

Yes, I would agree with that, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION;

So that it is appropriate to define them

separately and not—
MR. BOGGS;

I don't disagree

with that.

But I only

say that the instructions—the argument of course is not
necessary for my position.

Because if th® jury followed the

10
instruction and presumed purposee then they didn't have to ask
themselves the question, did he act knowingly? for they had
found sufficiently on the basis of that presumption to convict
him.
*

But supposing, as Mr. Justice White has said, that
th® crime did not even contain the term purposely? and the
only question was, did. this instruction prejudice the issue
on "’knowingly?" I think it tends to prejudice that issue,
because the concepts of intent and knowledge are interrelated.
That was th® only point I wanted to make in that
regard.
The—as I had stated, the question was fairly pr@j

sented, and the question of fact for jury determination.

The

instructions complained of spoke directly to that question.
The meaning of the instruction is ti^at the jury should
not reason from the evidence to a conclusion of guilt beyond
reasonable doubt, but rather should accept the acts presumed
without proof.
v'*"'

- X believe that that would be close, if not—I think

that’s a very fair statement of the common understanding of th®
term, presumed.
The---of course the law of presumptions is not simple,
and jurisdictions differ as to it.

But th© law of the State of

Montana as to presumptions is clear, and direct, and it is set

II
out in the rules of evidence that were applicable to this trial
It is stated in Rule 301 of the Montana Rules of
Evidence that a presumption is an assumption of fact that the
law requires to be made„
This presumption is stated to be a disputable presump
tion„

And as to disputable presumptions, the rule in Montana

in rule 301(b) is that a disputable presumption may be over­
come by a preponderance of evidence contrary to the presumption
Unless the presumption is overcome? the trier of fact must
find the assumed fact in accordance with the presumption.
QUESTION 2

Was this instruction given to the jury

which yousr© now reading?
MR, BOGGSs
QUESTION!
MR. BOGGS:

Mo,
Well? how is that material?
If therQ is any question as to how the

public mind might interpret presumptions? if it is thought that
the purposes—the interpretations ©f the law might have
influenced the jury's consideration ©f the meaning of

the

instructions? then I believe the rule states what that meaning
would be.
QUESTIONs

But how does that apply to the jury?

Tha

jury visas its own-each one of the jurors uses his individual
interpretation of purpose? doesn’t h©?
MR, BOGGS s
this rule was

W© cannot assume that the jury knew what

12
QUESTION:
MR, BOGGS:

Yeah, that's what 1 mean.
On the other hand, we cannot he sure that

at least one of them didn't know what it w&s.
QUESTION:

Well, i@ the ©abject of rebuttable pre­

sumptions, in the legal context, something w© would ever expect
to b© generally known to the public, members ©f juries, unless
the judge has instruced them on it, as Mr, Justice, my'colleague,
has just suggested to you?
MRe BOGGS:

I feel confident in saying, Mr,, Chief

Justice, that a jury is not going to know th© convolutions and
details of

th© law of rebuttable presumption»
QUESTION:

It's difficult enough for them to grasp

th© ones they are instructed about, isn't it?

MR» BOGGS:

I wouldn't think that this particular

instruction would have been difficult for them to grasp; some
perhaps would be, but this one would not®
But I certainly would say that they would not know th®
law of presumptions®

Thatdoes not mean, however, that they

would not be somehow influenced by th® clear statement of what
a presumption means in th© State ©£ Montana as it's contained
in Rule 301, which was a codification of the prior assisting
statute, and stated the ease law rule as well»
QUESTION§

And you don't think the instructions 13 and

14, and the others that you must be convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt, offsets and takes ear© of this presumption?

13
MR. BOGGSs

No, 1 don't, Mr» Chief Justice»

And 1

believe that the Montana Supreme Court itself, in its second
opinion in State of Montana. v0 McKenzie stated better than I
could why that instruction would not cur® the error contained
in

instruction number 5? and that is, whan it said that yes,

the State carries the burden of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, but the presumption is a means by which that proof can
shouldered?

I'm paraphrasing, not quoting®

QUESTION:

Mr® Boggs, you have going for you another

presumption Instruction, don't you?
' MR. BOGGS %
QUESTION %

Yes.
You are instructed that the law presumes

a person innocent until he's proven guilty.
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You don't think that operates to balance

the on© of which you complain?
MR. BOGGS:

Again, X think it is likely that a jury

would believe that the instruction number 4 followed directly
by instruction number 5 was compatible in the law? that they
would believe, as X believed, that the court was capable of
stating a blatant contradiction, on® right after the other,
would shake their belief in the consistency and fairness of the
law. :—_
And I bsliev© that they would think that instruction
number 5 was to b© read

&s

compatible? it was to to® read as a

14
means by which instruction number 4 could be satisfied.
QUESTION %

Is there a harmless error in Montana?

Does the harmless-doss the Montana Supreme Court ever hold that
the failure to give—giving an improper instruction was harmless
error?
MR. BOGGSs
QUESTION £

Yes* Mr. Justice Rehnquisfe.
Your client confessed, and his confession

was'-introduced against him?
MR. BOGGS:
QUESTION *
MR. BOGGS:

Yes.
What was the theory of your defense?
The theory of the defense was that the

statements as contained in the confessiora 'were not proof beyond
a reasonable doubt that he acted purposely or knowingly,
QUESTIONi

Well, I'm looking at page 11 of the

!

Appendix, which is part of the confessions
wheel her
to do.

"She started to

wheel chair and 2 got scared and didn5t know what

There was a knife laying on the counter, so 2 grubbed

that and stabbed her.

I stabbed her in the back five times."

Now with a confession like that, does it really make
to© much difference, how finely tuned the instruction of the
judge is?
MR. BOGGS s

Your Honor—-Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

based on that same language, two court-appointed mental
health experts acting independently of one another, cams to the
conclusion that he did not act purposely or knowingly,

15
QUESTIO!*? $

And all that was submitted to the jury for

their decision?
MR. BOGGS:

Yes.

Beyond that, might X say that this Court has ruled in
a different case* where a man was stabbed thirty times, that
no matter how strongly the Court may believe that the element©
of the crime are mad© out, that cannot deprive the defendant
of the right of a properly instructed jury.
But that's not the same ease as we have.

Because as

X told you, those as®®.© facts ware the basis of two independent
assessments that said that the elements of the crime were not
mad® out.
QUESTION?

What stage in the proceeding was the
?

insanity defense abandoned?
MR. BOGGS %

The insanity defense was of course first

raised at the time of arraignment.

W© had appearing before fchs

court on the issue of insanity, at which time feh© exparts stated
their view that the man was ian@.

tod for all intents and

purposes, at that time fch© defense was abandoned.
tod 1 informed the jury and the court that it was
formally--! formally informed them that it was abandoned at the
time ©£ my opening remarks.
QUESTIONi

Well, if you rely to any extent now on the

psychiatric testimony or on his condition, ar© you then indirectly
suggesting .a diminished responsibility idea?

IS
MR. BOGGS2

Bo.

And I in admitting that the

petitioner had the capacity to form the mental elements
required--the defense is that he did not form those al@K-.ents.
That is, that he was sane.
Mow, he was—had certain personality makeup that
lent itself perhaps fc© this situation.

But I am not saying

that it was such that it prevented him from having the capacity
to form the mental ©1manta required for this crime.
QUESTION*

And th© court specifically so instructed?

Number 12?
MR. BOGGS*

1 believe that5® correct, YcW Honor.

They were instructed that they could not consider the defense
of insanity.
QUESTION«

Yes.

You have no objection to that

instruction?
MR. BOGGSs

1 was bound by it.

1 had invited it by

my swn remarks.
The jury was assembled to determine the factual
question, th© presumption told them that the law presumed
what their conclusion was to b©* and by mo instructing them
it deprived petitioner of due process of law in depriving him
of a jury determination of guilt based on all of the evidence,
upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
And that is my case.

General?
OEM. ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. 6REELY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GREELYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Certainly the State of Montana is not enamored
with this instruction,

tod sine© the beginnings of this ease

w© have informed the prosecutor© in the State of Montana
not to use it.
That's not to say that we do not believe the
instruction as used in this particular case--that we do
believe that the instruction as used in this particular case
is unconstitutional.
We have told the prosecutors not to use it essentially
for the problems that have ©risen, tod I call your attention
?
?
to the Mann instruction in the, I believe it's the Chiantes
case of the. Fifth Circuit, which had a lot of problems with
instructions similar to this.

And rather than trying to draft

some kind of instruction that would meet all of the different
opinions that we’ve received from all ©f the different
circuits,, we decided to inform prosecutors that this instruetion probably wasn't needed.
And indeed, in this particular case, our position
is essentially that the instruction was superfluous.;
Now, in Montana, there ar® essentially three elements o

18
the crime of deliberate homicide.

One of the elements is that

it has to be a voluntary act; and another element is that the
defendant had to cause the death of his victim; and thirdly,
the act had to be committed either purposely or knowingly .
How that isn't the alternative.
QUESTIONs

You don't think they're the same?

MR. GREELYs

Absolutely not.

Purpose—if you were

going to try and prove "purposefully," you would have to
prove specific intent to kill.

If you're going to prove

"knowingly," you can prove that the defendant had a high
probability that the acts he was committing would create in
this case, death; the actual stabbing.
QUESTIONs

Well, would you always then—-if you ever

found purpose, you would always find "knowingly," too?
MR. GREELYs

Probably.

I suspect that rather than

always—if you ever find purpose, always find knowingly, I
think probably the likelihood of ever finding purpose isn't
too great, unless you really have a—if you have a premeditated
the old premeditated malice aforethought situation, you
probably can find a purpose.
QUESTION?
knowingly, then?

Well, why would you ever put purpose or
why wouldn't it always just be knowingly if

you always—
MR. GREELYs

I'm not certain

of the justification

for it other than that our criminal cede was adopted largely

19

from the—
QUESTION%
MR. GREELY:
QUESTIONs

And they do define them separately?
They are defined separately.

And they—

.And yon don't know which the jury found in

this case, do you?
MR. GREELY?

No.

But I think it's pretty clear in

this case as far—
QUESTION?

Well, you don't know.

You don't know.

Let's assume that there was something wrong with the
\

instruction on purpose, unconstitutional.

Say the instruction

on purpose, defining it, or somehow, was unconstitutional.
Then you'd have a problem, wouldn't you?

Because you wouldn’t

know which ground the jury rested on, whether it's purpose
or knowingly.

Because it's a general verdict?

MR. GREELY?

Well, obviously, you'd always have that

prob3_em in determining what the jury actually—what they relied
upon.
But I think the Court can look at the facts in this
case, and the attempts by the defendant in his proof would
indicate the jury in this case could probably—more likely than
not have found knowingly as opposed to purpose.
I think the—I think defendant produced evidence to
indicate to the jury that the defendant didn't do it on
purpose, as far as their understanding of the instructions
were concerned.

I think that's fairly clear when you read the

20
confession and the transcript and so forth»
QUESTION;

But the judge thought there was a jury case

on purpose# didn't he?
MR. GREELY;

Well# he instructed on purpose.

And of

course# the alternative---the way the law la defined# the
statute itself would always require that both the instructions
be given# and that both knowingly and purpose would be used.
With respect to a given situation# the judge# within his discrete
could say that purpose is not applicable.
QUESTION s
MR. GREELYs
QUESTIONS

And I think that—

Suppose he—
—said that in this ease.
Suppose he hadn't instructed on knowingly

at all in this case? he just said purpose—just the purpose
instruction.
MR. GREELY%

Then I think there'd be some—there8d be

more of a difficult—more difficulty in upholding our position
than there would be otherwise.
QUESTION %

Oh# really?

You mean just on the evidence#

or would you think that your problem would be rooted in
instruction five?
MR.1 GREELys

j think that the fact that the jury

possibly could have found that—-used the presumption.

Now#

of course we're suggesting to the Court—
QUESTIONS

So your answer is# yes# instruction five

would give you real problema if all the judge had instructed

21
on was pmpose?
MR» GREELY:
QUESTIONS

I think that's correct, your Honor»
Which is the more aggravated of the two

crimes, purposely, or knowingly?
MR. GREELYs

1 don't know that they can ba—I don't

know that they can be separated?
QUESTION:

Which requires the more specific degree of

intent?
MR. GREELY: Certainly, purposely would require the
element of specific intent: and obviously, knowingly does
not.
QUESTION:

What does an indictment charge?

Just

deliberate homicide?
MR. GREELY:
or knowingly.

Deliberate homicide committed purposely

The charge in this case, of course, walways

describes the fact that the defendant had killed a victim
in whatever manner he did it.
QUESTION:

Well, so what difference does it make whether

the jury finds it was—-in this case th© jury didn't make any
finding as to purposely or knowingly.
MR. GREELY:
QUESTION:
find that.

Does the judge sometimes require them to

was don© either purposely or knowingly?

MR. GREELY:
Your Honor.

Correct.

I don't believe that's ever happened,

I obviously don't know.

I've never—in my

22
experience, in any cases that are brought before our Supreme
Court that I'm directly familiar with, I'm not aware of any
instruction being given on just one or the other; it's almost”
it's always, it always has been given in. the alternative, just
*x

as tie wording of the statute.
QUESTION;
the disjunctives

--position, Mr. Attorney General, is in
purposely or knowingly?

Isn't it?

MR. GREELYs That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And is a finding of either one to support”

and the sentence is simply th® minimum-maximum sentence as
if

3.1

-

provided for the defense of deliberate homicide?
MR. GREELYs

That's correct.

And also, purposely

and knowingly also is required as a part of mitigated
homicide, even though the instruction in this case was—that
was given to th© jury was wrong.
QUESTION?

Well, assume—let's just assume that if

there had been an instruction on purpose alone, that this
conviction would have to be reversed because of instruction
number five.

Let's assume that.

Now, there wasn't an instruction on purpose alone.
It was an instruction on purpose or knowledge.

Now you think

the 5!or knowledge" would save th® case?
MR. GREELYs
QUESTION:

Y©s.
Because, you think the evidence is—it's

so likely the jury want on that ground?

23
MR® GREELY:
QUESTIONS

Correct®
Is that what the case turns on or not?

MR® GREELY§

Well, no, I think the case turns on if

there is—the alternative to that, ©f course, in this case is
that the question is whether or not the jury had taken a
short-cut, and had accepted the purpose instruction and
used the presumption in the meaning—or the way it's described
in Montana law that there would—it would raise a serious
constitutional question®
And that's the primary reason wa have suggested to
the prosecutors not to use it any more, because it could
happen that a case would come that would cause that problem.
But as far as the State is concerned, the presumption
i
as it was given in this case had a similar effect to the
inference of ours, that the fact that it wasn't fully described
in any of the other instructions®
Now, usually In Montana you will find that this
presumption is given—that other instructions are given that
would qualify it®

In this particular case, that didn't

happen, for whatever.

So there wa»@ no qualified instruction

saying that it—saying that the defendant had to be—that if
it were an inference that the jury could or could not find
that presumption®
But, obviously, in any situation when you're proving
intent, you've got the problem of an inference or presumption®

24
Because you can't really prove intent by direct evidence0
Basically? the State5s aware of the constitutional
questions that arise here»

And essentially as we understand

the history of this Court in the various casos that hav©
been cited in the brief? namely? the series of cases Gainey?
Todd? and other cases which relate to specific intent crimes?
the--the problem

here is whether or not the burden of proof

has shifted to the defendant? and that the defendant is in a
position of having t© prove a specific element? or disprove a
specific element? of the crime»
And 1 think this case relate® in that respect to
Mullaney»

But in the Mullaney case? th® aspect of malice?

which was an el@sj.ent of that crime? that aspect of malic©
was presumed?' end the defendant was in th® position of having
to disprove that»
Mow? in the State of Montana, mitigated deliberate
homicide has the same elements a® deliberate homicide? except
that it can be mitigated by an affirmative defense of extrema
emotional or mental distress»
The presumption in this case—-and I use the term
loosely? because you are all ©war® that presumptions and
inferences have become tremendously confused»

I do not agree

with the defense counsel that th© legal description of a pre­
sumption in the State of Montana applies t© this ease?
because those instructions war® not given to the jury»

25
So the effect of the presumption—of the term, a
parson is presumed to intend the ordinary consequences of his
acts, has soma other meaning in this case*

And we're suggesting

that the meaning in this ease is that the presumption had the
effect of an inference, an inference very similar to that
in Barnes*
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, the™-number fifteen,

the cleanup, the final catch-all instruction, you are to
draw no conclusions or inferences from the fact that the
defendant does not testify*
i

Now, if they went through the process of analysis that
we perhaps mistakenly assume that they do, wouldn't they get
some ideas out of instruction number 15 that they could
not draw any conclusions or inferences ©r presumptions from
th© fact that the defendant didn't take the witness stand?
MR. GREELY:

1 think that's probably true, Your Honor*

I don't know what effect that would have had as far as the
i

jury's looking at instruction number 5.

The thrust of the—

the thrust of the defendant's ease, apparently, was in essence
to prove that he could not have ©rested the intent to kill,
and mistakenly, the instruction was offered to suggest that
if the jury did not find knowing or purpose, that he would be—
he could ba convicted of mitigated deliberate homicide.
Now, that's an incorrect instruction.

However, it is

clear, I believe, that the jury h&d an opportunity to look at

26
the knowing and purpose instrustions, and I suspect that the
way this case came about that the jury believed the testimony
of the defendant's witnesses that the defendant indeed ?did not
have the intent to kill; and therefore,, they were forced into—
if they wore going to find deliberate homicide, they were
forced to look at the knowingly provisions, and the definitions,
that he should have understood the high probability of the
consequences of stabbing the deceased„
And I think that that's indeed what happened in this
case *
QUESTION?

Mr» Greely, let me—-X want to be sure I

understand the thrust of your position,,

Your opponent has

conceded in response to Mr» Justice Rehnquist, if the
instruction had said you may infer instead of the law presumes,
it would have been all right»
Are you arguing in effect feh© jury

may have so

understood the instruction?
MR» GREELYs

Yes»

We're arguing that they could have,

that the Instruction itself, since the facts of the case
indicated that the jury could have found him guilty of
deliberate homicide, based on the knowingly aspect of the
element of proof, that the jury could have disregarded the
instruction»

Or if they had looked at the instruction, that

they could have taken the position that it was aa infaranee
like that in Barnes; in other words, that it—*

27
QUESTION:

That they could not—

MR. GRHELYs

—that because he stabbed this person that

he intended to kill her»
And I believe the facts in the ease indicate that the
jury came to the conclusion that he did not intend to kill this
person.

I think that's probably what they came to—obviously—

it appears almost more likely than not that that's what
happened.
QUESTION:

Well, except that—the jury is the judge of

th® facts, which should—determines on all the admissible
evidence in the case.

But it—as to th© law, it gats its

instructions from the trial judge.
And this instruction wasn't that the law allows you to
presume, or permits you to infer? it says th© law presumes,
and that was th© law, as that jury was instructed.

Th® law

presumes that a person intends th© ordinary consequences of
his voluntary acts.
And that would require them, if they were—did their
duty ©s jurors, to take th® law ®s it was given to them by the
trial judge to find this person guilty of intention purposeful
homicide? if th® law presumes that.
MR. GREELYs

It could, if feh@y didn’t have th©

alternative of accepting a knowingly prospect.
QUESTION %

Why would they ©van turn to the alternative

after being told this by the trial judge, that th© law

28
presumes this?
MR, GREELYs

I think that fch© reason they would

turn fco it is because the facts in the case would have suggested
to them that possibly defendant did act intend to kill,
QUESTIQHs

But feh® law—they were told that the law

presumes that a person intends, and these were voluntary acts?
there's no question of that,
MR, GREELYs

Wall, the only—certainly they—

was. and whether or not—

it better?

MR„ GREELYs

I think that if they had treated it as an

tells you to do this.

The law prosum©a it®

No the law

c
entitles you to presume it or authorises you to infer it, but
that the law itself presumes it,
MR. GREELYi

True, that's true.

That instruction,

it's possible that it could have been interpreted that way,
QUESTION *

There is the risk, I take it—

29
MR. GREELYs
QUESTION:

Exactly.
—-there Is the risk that once the jury has

found that the act was voluntary, which they would find from
finding that it was purposeful» then the next step ia» as
Mr. Justice Stewart suggested» almost automatic; at least
that is the risk that they would think it out that way if
juries indeed do go through that sort of process.
MR, GREELYs

Certainly there is the—-certainly wa

could not deny that there isn’t & risk in this case.

But

essentially that is why the instruction has created some
difficulties.

And X think it's clear in this case that the

prosecution could prove deliberat® homicide beyond a
reasonable doubt based on the knowing aspect of the elements
of proof» and possibly even by an inference» such as a

\

Barnes inference» could have proved inference beyond a
reasonable doubt.
But obviously the better position to stand with» and
the better approach to take as far as what the jury actually
did» is that they found the defendant did this knowingly»
and even that they may have found'that they accepted the
defendant’s evidence and found that h© did not intend to kill»
bo

ppurposely did not become a part of their deliberation.
Basically» we're—the Stats is also arguing that the

effect of the instruction number S acting as an inference»
rather than a presumption» that if there was any shifting that

30

was taking place as far as the defendant was concerned, that it
was a shifting of the burden of pjoduction and not the shifting
of a burden of persuasion.

Although admittedly Montana law

suggests that a presumption does not suggest—- states that a
presumption requires a parson to overcome that presumption by
a preponderance of the evidence.
In this case

if that instruction were treated as

an inference, th© effect of it, according to the ruling of
our Montana Supreme Court in this case, would be that the
defendant would be required to com® forth with some evidence,
just as in the Barnes case when the inference was used to
state that the defendant knew that h® recently received
Treasury notes were stolen.
The inference in that ease

that the more possession

of those recently-stolen notes would create the presumption or
inference—and those terms are used interchangeably, although
I think most scholars understand what the difference between
01

those two are—that in that ease, essentially, you*re requiring
the defendant .possibly to testify in violation of his Eifth

More subtle because there were not any

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BYRON W. BOGGS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
----MR. BOGGS s

,

I wanted to pursue a point that Mr .

Justice Rehnquist raised.

And if I understood you correctly,

you asked which was the worst crimef to purposely take a
life or knowingly take a life.
And the commentators to the code—it was enacted in
1973---that originated this language, state that purposely
is the worse crime,
v

It is the equivalent ©£. the premeditated homicide in
H
the common law.
QUESTION:

What operative effect does that—does it

have, when the jury comes out and simply finds a verdict of
deliberate homicide, no separate verdicts ©r® requested as
to whether it was purposeful or deliberat®, what operative;
effect does it have on your client.

32
MR0 BOGGSs

Well» this is th® reason I wanted to

pursue that point.
QUESTION;
MR» BOGGS:

Because I think it has due process

With th® general verdict; guilty

of deliberate homicide , based on the information stated in the
disjunctive , the sentencing judge than is prepared*, or may*
sentence either the minimum ©r the mssimum, as I baliev© you
observed.
And of course tha maximum was 100 years in prison.
Now. if I understood the Attorney

General correctly, h© has

said that h© thought th© jury probably concluded that the
petitioner did not intend t© kill.

And I would

say, well, he

did not act purposely then.
And that is th© worst crime.

But under the general

verdict, the judge could sentence to th© maximum.

And 1

argued to the judge at sentencing that there was not th®
aiements of premeditation, and that premeditated murder had
been considered th© worst crim© in eur tradition, and that h®
should consider a lesser penalty than the maximum penalty,
based on that proposition.
maximum penalty, 100 years.

And he sentenced him to the

QUESTIONz

You don31 have capital punishment in

Montana?
MR, BOGGSs

It is not applicable under the facts as

stated»
The prosecution attempted to place the case within
the context of the capital punishment statute,
QUESTION*
MR, BOGGS*
QUESTIONs
MR, BOGGS*
QUESTION*

So you do?
But the judge took it away from th® jury,
So—I see.

In this case—

In this case it was not within his—
—th® death jsentences could not have been

imposed?
MR, BOGGS*
QUESTION:

That's right.
Does Montana practice permit th© requesting

of separate—submission of a verdict asking the jury to
decide whether they found it bto b© purposeful or knowingly?
MR, BOGGS*

I know of no procedent for that?

Although after arguing this case, I think 1 might pursue one»
Now, with respect t© th© suggestion by th© Attorney
General that th® state—th© Instruction, the law presumes
a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary
acts, shifted the burden of productione And this is in the
©pinion of the Montana Supreme Court,
The—unfortunately it doesn't make sense in this
case.

The burden of production would have required—and the

34
Montana Supreme Court said it mm Id have required—that he
produce some evidence contrary to the fact presumed»

But

in characterising the defense evidence, it characterised it
as being to th® effect that the defendant may not have intended
the death»
So by its own characterisation; it certainly called
for some evidence contrary to the fact presumed»

So there

was a contradiction inherent in that position.
Finally^ of course, in that regard; the jury was not
told that that was th© requirement under that instruction.
If I'understand th© .Taw of those jurisdictions that interpret
presumption as shifting th® burden of production and requiring
the production of some evidence; and w© have some of those
with regard to affirmative defenses, it is that once the—
some evidence has been produced , then th© jury is directed - to
weight the evidence, according

to th® applicable burden of

persuasion which of course would have bean proof beyond' s.
i

reasonable doubt»

And there would have bean no instruction as

t© the presumption.
But in this case, of course, the jury was instructed*
QUESTION*

The Attorney General has told us that this

instruction is no longer given in criminal cases in Montana*
D© you acknowledge th® truth—th© accuracy of that statement?
MR* BOGGS §

It may have been that he's directed feh®

county attorneys to discontinue th© use*

But as i© always

33

th© casa in circumstances of this kind—
QUESTION 3

It doesn't help your client?

MR. BOGGSg

It doesn’t help mina» and it'll continue

to b© used until each on© of them is alternately brought in

line»
QUESTION:

It isn't binding ©n th© trial judges*

X

suppose th® Attorney General can’t enforce that request*
MR. BOGGS*
QUESTIONt

No*
H© can merely direct his county attorneys*

MR. BOGGSt
QUESTION s

Yes.
Ths casas you cite in your brieffrom th®

/

Federal courts of appeal» as x glance over them, all indicate

I
disapproval of this sort of instruction and said to the
district courts in their respective circuits, don’t do this
anymore, but didn’t reverse the convictions? is that about
right?
MR. BOGGS*
Justice Stewart.

Some reversed th© convictions# Mr', "

There have been a mise of cases that either

reversed or didn’t reverse.

The cases in general predate this

Court’s ruling in MulXaney, and in many cases predate this
Court’s ruling in re Winship.
QUESTION;

I5m looking at page 21# what’s that, the

Second Circuit and th© Third Circuit? the Ninth. Circuit.
They’ve all been just admonitions not to do it anymore#
haven’t they?

36
MR. BOGGS s

I think both the Ninth Circuit cases were

reversals.
QUESTION s
MR. BOGGSs

On that ground?
On that ground,

And I think that may be

also true of at least one, if not both, of the Second Circuit
cases.
The two supervisory opinions, as it were, in the
Fifth Circuit and the Third Circuit, do not reverse.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
Thank you, gentlemen.

Very well.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon at 1:49 o'clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.3
