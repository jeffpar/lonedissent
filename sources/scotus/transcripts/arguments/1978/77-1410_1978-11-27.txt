you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. STEVEN BRACKETT, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BRACKETT;

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it plaasa

fell© Courts
This ©as® arose as a controversy between a
mortgage® and the bankrupt estate as to whether or not feh©
mortgagee of feh® bankrupt ©state was entitled to rent
realized from mortgaged property between the time of the
mortgagor9® bankruptcy and feh© sal© of this property
pursuant to mn order of feh© bankruptcy court,
I

think it’s necessary preliminarily that w©

discuss some of the fact® in this e&s© as feh@y relate t© the
North Carolina law, and if ’feh® Court will indulge me, I would
like fee discuss feh@£i@ facts £a detail.
This ©as© began as a Chapter XI proceeding,* that
is & plan ©£ arrangement «uder feh© Bankruptcy Act wherein
a bankrupt ©state, in tills ©as®, owned tracts of real
©state a© well &@ personal property which was sold as
merchandise in a retail business.
Only at

real ©state owned by feh© bankrupt estate

4
cw 4

th@r® existed a first deed of trust., and also second deeds of

trust»
During the period ©f arrangement, after the
commencement of Chapter II proceedings, work was don® and
performed at the instruction of the bankruptcy court by
various attorneys,, certified public accountants, and others.
There was about $800,000 worth of personal property
which was inventoried in the 'bankrupt estate which was disposed
©ff during this period @f arrangement.

No proceeds were

dedusted from the sale ©£ this personal property in inventory
fc© b& applied t© th© cost ©f administering the bankruptcy
©state ©r as payment £@r any ©£ th© attorneys, accountants
and various other ®mpl@y@e® engaged by the bankrupt ©state.
During the period of bankruptcy, some on© year after
the

'bankruptcy had been initiated, th® second holder of deeds

ef trust in the property perceived that the bankrupt ©state
under its plan of arrangement was not able to keep current the
first deeds of trust or th© first security on th© real astat©.
Therefore, these first and second mortgage holders
through th© bankrupt debtor’s attorney, sought the appointment
of a receiver who was to receive and collect all ineo m©
produced by the estate, that is, the rental income from the
real ©state, and apply that, pursuant to th© order of the
bankruptcy court, to federal and state income tare®, the
monthly mortgage payment® d«@ the first mortgagors,* t© th®

5

Ikw 5

ad valorem taxes; payment ©f fire insurance; and to the
interest and principal payments due the second mortgage
holders.
It was also, within a period of a few months later,
a standby trust®© appointed»
trustee

This standby trustee is the

defendant in this case»
Also, at the time this receiver was appointed for the

collection of the rent, there — bankruptcy court specifically
ordered that th® second secured parties in the real estate
not attempt in any way t© petition or foreclose their property
in th® state courts without the specific permission of the
bankruptcy ©@«rt»
This, of course, was in addition to the general stay
order that had been executed against th© creditors when the
bankruptcy proceeding was initiated»
Because of default by several of the bankrupt — the
defet©r-in~p©@s®8si@n ereditors, that is, several tenants on
their r@al estate in their mortgage — in their rental
payments, th© tenant and other financial reversals — there
was not sufficient cash flow being generated by th©
debtor in possession to ©omply with th© bankruptcy judge’s
order regarding payment of th® — the various four payment® that
I°ve previously mentioned t© the Court»
This petitioner, therefore, who is her® before you
today filed an application with th© bankruptcy court on th©

6

6

30th day of December, 1974, to have one of three acts performed
by til® bankruptcy court:

that is, to convert the Chapter XI

proceeding, that is ‘the plan of arrangement, t© a liquidating
bankrupfecyi two, t© remove the stay outstanding against the
second d@©de ©f trust holders so that they could pursue their
state remedies under the state laws of North Carolina? ©r
three, fe® <e@nv@rfe the proceeding from a Chapter XI fe© a
Chapter X proceeding under the bankruptcy rules»
At this time, the second deeds of trust outstanding
t® fefe© petitioner in this case war© not in default? they w@r®

paid current*
On the 14th day @2 February, 1975, the bankrupt —
that is, feh© debtor in possession, wasi

adjudged to b®

bankrupt ~ was adjudged bankrupt.
A trust®® was appointed, that is, the trust©© who is
the def@nd©nt inthis case, wag appointed fe© proceed with the
bankruptcy proceedings.

K® was ordered — in hi® order, and

the ©rd©r appointing him as trust®©, to collect and receive all
nsnts, issue, income and prefifes and fe© hold and retain all
monies and profit received to the end that the same may be
applied under this ©r different or further orders of the court»
.tod on April 16th of 1975, some two months after the
trusts©® appointment, the ire was a first meeting of creditors»
It was suggested at this time by the trustee, as well as the
petitioner in this case who was a second mortgage holder, that

7
Jkw 7th

ther© was no equity in the property, and that the property
should ba conveyed ~ not abandoned, but conveyed -- to fch©
second mortgage holder in order that they could work out
arrangements with feh© first security holders under the real

©state *
At this time the bankruptcy court, in its hearing as
documented in th© appendix in this record, suggested that there
were substantial amounts of administration costs of bankruptcy
which had accrued during the period ©f the arrangement, and
was curious a© t© what sours® would produce the money to
satisfy the costs ©f administration, and indicated ala© that the
economic conditions were bad at that time:, that perhaps they
w©uld improve in the next several months, and indicated
therefor® to the second mortgage holder and the trustee that he
was not inclined to convey the property to the second
secured parties under the real ©state»
Thereafter, the property was sold pursuant to an order
©f th® bankruptcy judge, late in July ©f that year»

At the

time of the sale, which was a public sale after d«© notice,
there was a substantial deficiency? that is, lath© sum of
approximately $213,400? that is, that the; second deeds ©f
trust holders wars without their security t°

that

extente
The petitioners in this case again approached the
bankruptcy court, moved that the bankruptcy court not confirm

8

dkw 8

this sale* and that they abandon the property to the
second secured holders®
The bankruptcy court declined ./

x

Than the petitioner

in this ease appealed it t© the district court; the district
court remanded to the bankruptcy court with the instruction
that the bankruptcy court ©rd@r the property sold again with
the petitioners, that is, the second mortgage holders, being
allowed to us© the credit due them on their deads of trust
t© the extent ®£ $360,000»
Under these conditions y@«r petitioner in this ease
purchased the property, having a deficiency undor hi@ debt ©f
$186,000 o

-

.

Thereafter,, the trustee in this ease drew a deed
conveying all four tracts of property fe© the petitioner in
this s&@©®

The petitioner — the trust©© ale© had that deed

recorded and delivered it to the petitioner in this case.
S@©n after the petitioner made claim for disbursement
©f funds ®n hand, soma $160,000 plus accrued interest, which
were collected by the trustee m rental ©si the property in
which the petitioner held the security in®
Th© bankruptcy judge held a hearing regarding this,
and found that the petitioner in tills case was an unsecured
creditor fe© the extent of $186,000®
From this ruling, petitioner appealed to the district
courta

The district court reversed the finding of the

9

lew 9

bankruptcy judge»
Circuit.

This order was appealed to the 4th

Th© 4th Circuit reversed the district court's

order, determining that the petitioner in this case had not
complied with th© state law ©f North Carolina in seeking to
sequester and have these rentals set aside and held for his
benefit, and therefor® declaring him to b© an unsecured creditor.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Brackett, let me interrupt then at this

point.
MR. BRACKETTS
QUESTION t

Yes, sir.

Do you have any comment with respect t©

tli@ passage of th© n@w Bankruptcy Act and its hearing on this
esstg"'

MR. BRACKETTs

four Honor, we felt like that was

probably ©a® ©£ the reasons we were her®, and on this case.
I don't -- in my ©pinion, I don't see th© baaring
of the p&ssag® of the new Bankruptcy Act on this case, other
than perhaps paragraph 57(h), which has been cited by -the
govemment in their brief here„

That might have some

bearing•
And also, I think we need to have a resolution of
the diversion between the circuits here, in order that secured
creditors can know what their standing is, and what is going to
b® required ©f them to protect their interests when their
monies are in the hands of a trust fund.
QUESTIONS

Well, if it does ha^@ a boaring, it may

10

ikw 10

make this ease a lot i@ss important than it might otherwise
be.
MR» BRACKETTS
QUESTION:

Yss, sir»

Lot m® read this on® provision to you:

The commencement ©f a ease creates an estate.
©state is comprised of the following property:
product, offspring, rent.
MRs BRACKETT:

Such

proceeds,

Which would cut against you?
Y@ss, sir.
*

To that extent, 1 again reiterate fe© his Honor,
that t© the extent, of the new Bankruptcy Act, we're not that
familiar with the proposed new Bankruptcy Act? fe© the extent
that this affects, or the new draft ©f the Bankruptcy Act
would affect th® rights of secured debtors, then yes, this
cas® is of asfcrema importune® t© th© drafters of th© new
Bankruptcy Act and this Court in considering th© case.
QUESTION:

D© the courts of appeal in their split

treat it as a question of federal law ©si which they disagree,
©r do they treat it as a question of state law' arising
within their various circuits?
MR. BRACKETT:
©f the cases.

Your Honor, I think that is the split

I think lt = g a perception of the various

circuits as to what bankruptcy is.
Apparently the 3rd and 7th Circuits perceive bankruptcy
to b® an equitable remedy, and therefor® the 3rd and 7th
Circuits tend to apply equitable principles.

The remain — th©

11

Skw il

2nd, 8th and 9th Circuit», I thinks are the circuits that are
involved hera in these particular cases, follow the principle
that so far ae state 1m is not in conflict with federal bankruptcy
law* they are going to apply the stats law in recognition of
a secured creditor8® rights, only being consistent with the
real estate that's located in your states,
QUESTION:

Do any of the courts of appeal take the

position that if fch© creditor had

provided for, in the

Mortgage agreement, that the rent should suews the security,
that that would not b© followed by the bankruptcy court?
MR, BRACKETT:

No, sir, I don't believe so,

I don't

think we have ~ they have disregarded that principle, in any
©ass, t© apply a so-called federal rule.
they have adhered to that principle.

As a matter of fact,

That has been a consider­

ation in a number of *—
QUESTION %

S@ a mortgage® can protect himself within

any of the circuits by putting a provision in the mortgage

agreement.
MRa BRACKETT:

Skillful drafting of the mortgage

agreement would be the first step that a mortgagor would have
to protect himselfi yes®
As I have attempted to point, out fe© the Court,
there is a split among the circuits,

And the circuits that follow

the so-called equitable rule would be th© 3rd and 7th Circuits•
This was was a ©as© — the principal ©as®. s®fe out there Is the

12
Ikw 12

Bindaeil v. Liberty Trust Company.
This casia says that, in essence, that bankruptcy
interferes with state remedy t© such an extent that a creditor
is prohibited from exercising certain rights that h© might have
under state law, &ad in eases such as this, where equitable
principles would allow it, the bankruptcy court will allow his
lien, to the extent there is a deficiency, to follow the

raafealss that are turned over to the hands of a trusts®.
The remaining -- the remaining circuits, that is the
2nd, 8feh and 9th circuits, adhere t© the rule that they will
fellow the state law, and that that law Is to be applied c®r©“

fully.
Under either comprehension of the law, we suggest that
the petitioner has complied with — under
both circuits»

the diversion ©f

.tod in any event, in this ease the petitioner

should b& granted a security interest in these rents.
tod the primary basis for this is the ©as® of
Parkas Company v9 Coam^soial Bank of High Point.

This is

cited in 204 Worth Carolina 432.
W®

contend that this is the law in th© stata ©f

North Carolina? and that the 4th Circuit failed to properly
address itself to this case in determining that the petitioner
in this case had net complied with the state laws.
In the Parker @a@®, there was a judgment creditor,
that is, a creditor who had pursued his remedy through a

13
judgment; there was an outstanding mortgage held by a first
deed trust against an automobile company, or motor company.
The mortgagor, under the deed of trust, began a —
Initiated a foreclosure proceeding.

The judgment debtor in

that ease filed an action t© enjoin fch© foreclosure proceeding.
Rents were accumulated while this action was pending in the
courts ©f North Carolina,
Subsequently, the mortgage holder obtained a
deficiency judgment and reduced it to judgment.

The judgment

debtor, who had initiated the action to enjoin the foreclosure
had had a receiver appointed to collect these rents.
The court held that the mortgage creditor was entitled
t© satisfy hie deficiency judgment from the funds collected by
the receiver during the pendency of the action.
We contend that this ease is directly analogous
t@ the ease before the Court her©.

The opposition would

contend that w© have failed to take steps as required under
North Carolina state law t© protect ourselves, citing the
ess© ©£ Gregg va Williamoong which placas 'North Carolina in
alignment with the majority of states in this country that
require that a mortgagee, in order to assert a sscurity
interest in fch® real ©sfc&fe® —» in the rentals collected, tsk©
gome action which substitutas for taking possession of fch©

property.
That is, ordinarily, the mortgagee would have to take

14

ikw 14

possession of the property.

And these courts have held that

where taking ©f the property is not possible as in a bankruptcy
©as®,, the mortgage© must take some other action to protect
his security interest? that is, he must seek to have the rental
sequestered or seek to have a receiver appointed in the
bankruptcy proceeding.
In this ease —
QUESTION:

Mr. Brackett, can I just interrupt you?

MR. BRACKETTs
QUESTIONs

You're relying on the Parker case, is it?

MR. BRACKETTs
QUESTION 2

Y@s, sir.

Did y@« cite that in your brief?

MR. BRACKETT:
the government*

Yes, sir.

No, sir, we did not, it was cited by

And w® think that it was favorable to our

position.
QUESTION:

Oh, I sea.

MR. BRACKETT*
QUESTION%

All right.

Y©3, sir.

It8 a in the government brief?

MR. BRACKETT:

Yes, sir.

W© found in the Williamson

lisa© of cas@s ©it@d by the government.

And it's th® best case

wm contend @n th© standing, on what feh© requirements ©£ North
Carolina law ®r®i as t© whether or not w© have den© tlx© things
n@c©g©ary @r required by North Carolina law, w© contend that
w® feav®, and that9® fell® factual issu© that was addressed in
feta© dissent in th© 4feh Circuit by Judge Bryant.

15

3kw 15

Tha ~ our opponents in this case would have the Court
rule that actions taken by tha petitioner during the plan of
arrangement war© not taken during bankruptcy.
W© contend -- of course, have cited in our briefs
that proper — the applicable bankruptcy rules, which say
©f course that ~ and there are an umber of cases so holding —
that actions taken during the plan of arrangement are, of
sours®, equivalent t© tfees© actions which are taken after the
adjudication ©f bankruptcy.
We say that the real eruss of this case as it relates
t@ the petitioner is that h© had a receiver appointed by making
requests ©f the attorneys £@r th© debtor.

Our opponents would

argue t@ the Court that because the attorney for the debtor
actually filed the motion that that the petitioner should not

be allowed t© fe®®@£it from that.
1 ask th© Court t® address themselves in particular
t® that, application which recites th® fast that th© secured
creditors had approached the attorney for th® debtor and

i

requested this and fch© reasons therefor©.
Subsequently, in the Chapter —
QUESTIONt

Mr» Brackett —-

MR. BRACKETTS
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

— just so I can follow it.

2tss a

rather complicated ©as®.
MR. BRACKETTs

Yes, £tes a complicated set ©f facts.

16
i

16

I'm sorry.
QUESTION;

Two questions on that»

First, where in

the record is the document you just described?

And secondly,

in that document, did they request an assignment of the rant?
MR. BRACKETT;

No, air.

Th© document is t© be found in the record — bear
with m® for just s. moment.

At 204a in th© appendix.

This

w&s a petition fey th© attorney for th© debtor, and it
recites in th® petition that th® petition was made because of
th© request ®£ th© secured creditors.
QUESTION s

I thought you said North Carolina required

y©u t© get th® rents, t© request them.
MR. BRACKETT:

North Carolina requires that you take

posseesi©®, that the mortgage© take possession ©r ©feherwis©
seek t© protect himself by having a receiver appointed.
QUESTION $

Well, but you didn't r©qu©®t th© rent?

¥©u <s@uld have?
MR. BRACKETT;

No, ©is.

$!@ contend -» what we «lid her® was address th® attorn©;/
for th® debtor, auk him to have a receiver appointed, and that
th® receiver*s instructions from th© bankruptcy court were t©
collect th© rent®.

And then they established a priority as t©

how those rents were fc© be diepoasd ©£.
QUESTION;

what y©« called our attention to in feh@

r@©@rd is th© order appointing the trustee or whatever h@ is

17
to act for the cotirt.

And that order recites that the motion

was made by the attorney for the debtor.
MR. BRACKETT:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And you’re telling us that -that motion

was mad® by the attorney for the debtor because you requested
him to do so.
Where is your request for him to do so in the record?
MR. BRACKETT:

Your Honor, if you’ll look two pages

before that in the record, I believe you’ll ■— at 202.
QUESTION:

There are several parties — shall be

savings — &r© they all second mortgagees —
MR. BRACKETT:

No, sir.

As I point out to 'the

Court, again, this is a complicated fact situation.
QUESTION:

But this is the key to your case, as I

understand it.
MR. BRACKETT:
were four tracts of land.

Yes, sir.

There are four — there

Four different institutions held

first deads of trust on those properties.

The petitioner

held a so-called blanket deed of trust which was secured by
all four tracts of property.
Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

And the point is that the second

mortgage© or second deed of trust holders? requested this
procedure and that the first lien holder be taken car© of
first and all the rest would be paid t© your people?

18
tw 18

MR. BRACKETT 2

Yes, sir.

It might be important to note I think the record
QUESTION:

Yon really just asked that the mortgage

payments be mad®.- though,

MR. BRACKETTS
QUESTION:

And any balance t© unsecured creditors?

MR. BRACKETT:
QUESTION 1

Yes, sir.

No, sir.

Wall, that's what your request was.

MR. BRACKETT:

I think the request is to b® taken

in context with the order.
QUESTION:

And tha request was —

For the benefit of secondary lien holders

and fell© unsecured creditors,
MR. BRACKETTS

Yes, sir.

To the extent that — as the Court can see from the

order, titer® were four priorities set up.

And the unsecured

creditors were not a part of the priority ordered by the
bankruptcy eourfe at all.
QUESTION:

But tit® trustee didn't have to pay ~ ©r

didn't hav© to d@ anything more than pay the payments as they

©am© due?
MR, BRACKETT:

Y@Be sir.

He was required under th®

order fe© collect the rents,? te sequester those, to keep proper
leger card®, and the® to apply them in accordance with, th©

order of the bankruptcy judge.
w® say that that was a sufficient action on ©ur

19

dkw 19

part fe© eoxnply with North Carolina's requirement that a
r@c©iv@r b® appointed*,
QUESTION:

Wall# suppose there was more current

income than necessary fc© pay the mortgage payments.
MRa BRACKETT:
QUESTION:

¥©s# sir.

Wh&fc happens with the balance?

MR a BRACKETT:

Then that —■ it would be my contention

that that would accumulata until the conclusion of the
bankruptcy# and then it would fo© disbursed —
QUESTION:

That wasn't what — it doesn't sound like

what y@u asked for.
You didn't ~ was to® — did you accelerate the —
did you declare the entire balance duo on these mortgages?

MR. BRACKETT

%

No# air.

As I stated to the Court

in trying to r@eit© the facts® in this ease# what brought about
this request for a receiver was the fact that to® bankrupt
debtor in possession was not able from the sash flow to keep
feh© mortgage payments current.
QUESTION:

Well# I understand that.

But this occurred

after ~ did this petition and order occur after bankruptcy#
after a straight bankruptcy?
MR. BRACKETT1:
significant fact.

eir.

No# sir.

That's another

This occurred during the plan of arrangement.

When th® second creditors perceived that fcholr security was
in peril# they requested that a receiver be appointed.,

20

ikw 20

This receiver

QUESTIONS

After straight bankruptcy occurred, you

could have asked that the property be abandoned to you.

And

1 guoas you did, didn’t you?
MR® BRACKETT:

Yes, sir, we did.

The Court will s®® -QUESTIONS

Until you did that, you did nothing else

in @r<fl©r to try to get feh® rents?
MRa BRACKETT:

Yes, sir, we did.

If the Court will review the record, the Court will
find in addition t® the appointment ©£ this receiver, that on
D©©@ssib®r the 30th @£ 1974, and thera is a petition application
filed by the petitioner in this ease, t® have three things

d©ra©

by

the bankrupted court*
That ia, to convert it to a straight bankruptcy;

t.@ allow the second secured creditors to b© allowed to pursue
their stat® remedies; or to convert it to a Chapter X proceeding
under bankruptcy law.
So those things were done.
QUESTIONs

Wall, I knew.

And the ju^g© said -- what

happened vmm, it was put into straight bankruptcy»
MR. BRACKETT:
QUESTION:

Ye®, sir.

Now, what does the secured creditor, if

fe@ doesn't want to file a 'secured claim and proceed
accordingly, what doss he usually do?

21
MR. BRACKETT:

w 21

QUESTION:

la tills e&s® —

In state bankruptcy.

MR. BRACKETT:

In this ease, if there'a not equity

in the property for the general creditors or beyond his own,
h© asked that the property b© abandoned.
QUESTION:

And did. you?

MR. BRACKETT:
abandonment filed.,

Yes, sir, with a petition for

There was also mi oral request made at a

hearing which ~ the transcript ©f the hearing is in the

appendix.
Asad tha bankruptcy court at that time indicated -and I think this is an overwhelmingly significant fact — that
tfe@r@ were not sufficient funds ©a hand to pay the cost ©f
©drain!®taring the arrangement proceedings.

There war© not

sufficient monies t® do that, even though $800,000 worth of
inventory had haesi sold.
■ QUESTION:

But what are feh® priorities — what are

e@mp©r@bi@ priorities between <s@@ts ©f administration and
rent in a situation like that?
MR® BRACKETT:

We contend that where there is a

s©e®r©d ereditor who has not realized the full extent of his
d©bfe, that fete© priori,ties for tha rants generated by the real
©gt&t© lies with the secured ©raditor ©a the deficiency ©f
his debt.
QUESTION:

So the bankruptcy judge is not entitled

22

to say, there8 s not enough to pay the costs of administration,
s© I w©a8t abandon the property for that reason?
MR„ BRACKETT;

In my opinion, that was a gross abuse

©f discretion on the part of the bankruptcy judge»
What ha did in doing — in following this procedure
is, h® k©pt the security of a secured creditor away from him
in an attempt to generate funds to cover the cost of administerin
a bankruptcy proceeding»
QUESTION;

Wall, it wouldn't b© the first time a

bankruptcy jwdg© has dona that.
MR. BRACKETT;

No, sir, it would not.

It would

nsfc.
In —“ it0® particularly significant though that tha

bankruptcy court had appi?o¥®d and confirmed the sal© of a
ferem®nd©us amount ©f retail sales inventory without taxing
that property and fch@ funds derived from that property with
any cost @f feh® administration.
I think that0® very significant in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, did. the court of appeals ~ I gather

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. RYAN,

JR. , ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. RYAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s

I think it’s fair to say that all sides agree that
this cat©

th® issue in thin case is not answered by the

Bankruptcy Act as such.
And if I ffi&y rs£@r to a question Mr. Justice
Biaokmun posed earlier, I think that the new Bankruptcy Act
will not b@ any more helpful than fell© ©Id ©a® was.

I don’t

think that. the new Bankruptcy Act will answer this question
any

clearly than it is answered now.
S@ although rents specifically ar® mentioned, the

question ip whether th© mortgage interest overrides that right
t© rents.
I think it’s also fair fe© say that ail sides agree
in this case that had Golden Enterprises not gone into

25

ikw 25

bankruptcy, the petitioner* as mortgagee* would have had no
right under North Carolina law to the rents unless and until
instituted a foreclosure action and obtained the appoint­
ment ©£ a receiver to collect the rents for him,
tod where we part company in this case is that the
petitioner gays that bankruptcy makes all the difference
after that fact* stad wa say it really makes no difference
at alio
Specifically* w© recognize that one© the property
here earn® under the aegis ©f the bankruptcy court* which in
this ©as® was when the Chapter II petition was filed, the
petitioner was ss@ longer ffr©@ to begin foreclosure and' seek
the appointment of a receiver without the permission of the
bankruptcy court®
Th© petitioner argues that from that fact alone
h© was entitled to the rants as an equitable matter.

And

w© believe, on the other hand* that just a® the petitioner
would have been required under state law to take some affirmative
step to reach the rent in the absence of bankruptcy, so ha
should h® required to take some affirmative step to reach them
©no® bankruptcy

occurred »

Although foreclosure ia a state court and appointment
of a receiver in a state court war® barred to hi®, other steps
were not* a® I will discuss in a moment»
The petitioner argues, and h@ places a great deal

26
*

26

©f emphasis on this* that even if we are correct in that
reading of North Carolina law — and I don3 fc understand him to
disagree with us ©n that — ha did pursue an alternata
course sufficient t© protest his interest»
We foaliesv© that the court of appeals was correct
in holding that he did not do s©„
And finally w@ believe that ®v@n if the minority
v£@w of the circuits , and the view of the petitioner is
©orr®ct, that equity should prevail, the facts of this case
demonstrate that the petitioner has suffered no loss, looking
at the transaction ass a whole? and therefor®, that equity should
not require that the rests ba handed to him in this case.
But let as© return to ®y first and most important

point.
As this Court ha® recognised in & series of cases,
the nature .and extent of a ©roditor'e security interest in feh©
property of a bankrupt is a matter of state, and not federal,

law a
Congress presumably could make it otherwise in its
exercise of its powers under the bankruptcy clause, but it
has n©fe don® @@®

In this respect, it has chosen to defer to

gfeat© law.
Ond@r North Cardina law, if petitioner wished to
reach the r®ists @£ feh© property by virtue of his security
interest, he would have had to go to court and request that a

21
21

resalver be requested for that purpose.
Such a remedy Is provided in North Carolina law
a part of a foreclosure action.
As X say* we recognise that in this case that
precise step was not open t© him, but we do not believe that
by that fact h© could vindicate his claim by doing nothing.
That is ossenfcially what he is arguing here.

He is

saying that aino© 1 could not g© to stats court, X ought to
hav© tli© rent as a matter of aguity.
We believe that if he

■ •

wished to reach the rants,

that h© was obliged fe© tsJte® some action in ‘the bankruptcy

court.
As far as what the North Carolina law is, before X
leave that, X don"t think there is any dispute, and I don't
think there is any need for this Court to resolve conflicting
views ©f what th® law is in North Carolina, because the pe­
titioner has said that th© Parker case, which we cite in our
brief, is th© best ©as® @n what the North Carolina law is.
And w© agree with that,' and we think that the Parker
case states the law quit© succinctly.

And I would think that

if th® Court refers to that ©as®, it will have all the North
Carolina law it needs t@ decide this e&@*3„
That — my opponent did not quote the whole holding
of that ©as®, and 2 will only paint out to the Court that th©
Parker ease says, and X quote, ordinarily a mortgage© ©r

28

creditor secured by a dead of trust has no right to collect
the rents or other Income from property even after default
in the payment of a secured indebtedness.

This right arises

only after the mortgage® or trustee has taken possession of
the property conveyed by consent, ©r pursuant to an order or
d©er@© of a court of competent jurisdiction.
But where, aa in the instant ease, says the court,
a receiver appointed by the court in & foreclosure action has
taken possession of the property and collected the rents,
then the rents should b© applied as payment on the secured
indebtedness.
Now, we hav® no problem with that holding at all.
What —
QUESTION;
her®r, in that order,

Mr. Rymi, why isn't that what happened
h®

calls ©ur attention to, that, order

at 204 of the record, that h® requested that a representative
©£ the court b® appointed to collect the rents.
Isn't that

doesn't that fall right within that

language you just read?
MR. RYAN;
it does not.»

In this ease, no, Mr. Justice Stevens,

tod th@ reas®» it does not is because that request

was mad® during the arrangement proceedings of the ease.
In tli® first place, I would not agree -that it was a
receiver.

appointed

It was not a receiver? it was a» agent that was

29

ew 29

Bat even, assuming that it was a receiver, rule
201 ©f the bankruptcy rules, provide that when a trustee is
appointed in a liquidating bankruptcy, the receivership is
terminated.
So even if th@r© was & receiver appointed during
the Chapter XI phase ©f that «as®, that phase was ended and
that receivership was terminated by the appointment — or
actually by the qualification ©f the trustee.
N@t only that, but the trust©© — this is why this is

a matter @£ substance and net simply ©£ form — the
trustee received a completely separate and distinet set of
marching orders from that that had h@®n applied to this
agent ©r receiver or whatever h® is called.
Because th® agent or receiver was told to pay -t® apply the resits in a certain specific priority:

taxost

fir© insurance, and s© on and s© forth, with the second
mortgage© ©n the bottom of the list.
Th© trustee, on th© other hand, was told not to pay
any ©«penses, but to ©imply accumulate the rants produced
by the. property until further order of th© court.
S© by reason first ©f all ©f rul© 201 ©£ the
bankruptcy rules, and secondly, by th© fast that feh© trusts©
was given a totally different set of instructions from that
received by th© receiver in this case, w® say that that action
is simply insufficient to govern the rents fromth® .time

©f bankruptcy until the time 'that the mortgagee took
possession.
That's the tiros period that wa’re looking at in this
ease.

I would answer that question by saying

that it would depend on whet the effect of an adjudication of

31

dkw 31

MR. RYAN:

There aw two things that I think the

petitioner could have done in the bankruptcy court which we
think that he should have done.
Rule 701 provides for adversary proceedings to,
quote, determine the validity, priority, or extent of a lien
or other interest is property.

Petitioner could have filed

an adversary proceeding claiming that his mortgage extended
to an interest in the rent.
Under rul© 7S5 of th® bankruptcy rules, which
adopts rule 65 ©£ the federal rules,th© court could have
ordered the trust®© not to commit feh® funds pending an adjudication, although this* in fact is what that bankruptcy court
had told tiie trust®© anyway.
tod tfeea if petitioner had failed in this adversary
proceeding, the bankruptcy court could have entered an order
of sequestration or attachment telling fell® trust®© to pay
the rent® over to th© mortgagee.
Or,? a® a second sours© ©f set ion, the petitioner
could feav© gone in radar rulo 601 (c) ©£ th.© bankruptcy rules
and asked for relief £r«a th® stay ©f stat® court proceedings
which rule 601 imposes.
la othor word®, 60.1 says you will not enforce any
action against tin® property in © state court.

But there Is a

provision, section -Co) of that rule, that says that
©m application of any party or any creditor th® state ~ the

32
&kw 32

b&nkruptcy court may lift feh© stay arid permit the creditor
to go to state court.
So h© could have don® either on© of those two things.
W@9r©n©t asking for a feudal or ceremonial gesture.

We8re

asking for very real and substantive complianc© in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ryan, what about the conditions of the

mortgage thatthe mortgagee will have the benefit of the rent?
MR. RYANs

There was no such provision.

QUESTION:

I know, but what if there is?

MR. RYANs

If there is, that qu-astioa of whether or

1

I think there are

34

ikw 34

two reasons that wo are asking that the Court require the
petitioner fc© take some action.
In the first pl&o®, it- is not the scheme of the
Bankruptcy Act, it is not the intent of Congress, to giv© the
creditor any enhancement ef the remedies h© otherwise would
h&v® merely by virtu© ©f the fact that his debtor is in
bankrupt®]/ ©orart.
13<t could not readh these rents in the absence ©fa
specific action, namely, appointment off a receiver la state

©ourt? fe© (3h@uld not be able to d© s© in federal court absent
a ©@siparabl@ action.
The second reason,

©na that I think is most

important here, is that the petitioner8® &c3ts in this case,

©E’ lack ©f acts, have really disrupted the orderly adiainistratios
of this bankruptcy.

Because the first time that petitioner

ever ©@m© in and said, I have a right to these rants, was
after the property had been -sold, after his proof of claim
/

had been submitted.
2n fact, in his proof of claim, fe© specifically
disclaimed any interest i» these rents,

what h© said was, I

have n® interest other than, quote, that in the not® and

deed @f trust, end quote,

Neither ©f those documents said

anything about a security interest in rest.
So he presented this to the trust©® and said, here's
my proof of claim.

The trustee looked at it and said fin®,

35

dkw 35

and acted on that basis, and then nom® six months afterwards
h@ comes back in and says, well, I have also a proof — 1
also have a claim on fch® primary gousee of income in this
©stats.
That is simply eonfomding the trust©® and will
continue to ooafomd. feh@ trustee in future cases if that is the
result that is allowed hsr@6

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs Cagle.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE N. CAGLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS
MR. CAGLEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

Court:
Speaking as trustee, my colleague just stated it
is important for the trusita® and the bankruptcy rseurt and the
creditors'5 seommitte®, and others interested in a bankruptcy
©a®©, to know ms soon as possible what the liens ©r security
interests are on assets in a particular bankruptcy case.
And this ®€i@d 1» know, w® suggest, is amply satisfied by reliaao® on local law.
The local law la the source that w® contend should
be applied is this case.

Reliance on local law gives

the

debtor-creditor relationship emphasis ~ or it give® them the
knowledge that they need in the transaction® ia dealing with

36

real astata and the mortgages on them, that — so that when
there is a bankruptcy ease, everybody knows what their lians
and their status, their rights, are with respect to certain
assets in the bankrupt ©state,
Everybody in this particular case relied on that
fact, that is, that the local law was governing, and the fact
of the matter is that under local law, the petitioner had —
has no Ilea on feh® rent.
The p@titi@nar had a second mortgage on the real
©state, not a lies ©n the rente.
Bankruptcy intervening should not expand any of the
rights of the second mortgage® and grant to him any lien that
fe@ did not have.

That would be inconsistent.

We suggest that feh® bankruptcy law —■ the bankruptcy
court should follow th© jurisdiction of the situs of the
property*

itod I d©net -- d@ not foellev© that we really have

any dispute about th© law off North Carolina.

Gregg v.

Williamson or the Parker case, as we have cited in our brief,
is North Carolina, just to simply be redundant if I will —
If you permit as© — a mortgagee has t© file an action in state
court t© £©r®cl©@@ hi® mortgage as & part of the foreclosure
h© can obtainp as an ancillary remedy, the appointment ©fa
receiver.
The law is that he must obtain possession, that is,
h© must acquire a deed baffor® h® is entitled t@ feh® rent under

37
kw 37

th© law of North Carolina.
The analogous part in bankruptcy, if you want to talk
about due process, a mortgage® has remedias available, proced­
ures available, to it, in existing Bankruptcy Act, that is,
part 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, rule 701 and the subsections
©r sections thereafter, allows the a trustee os creditor to
institute an adversary proceeding which is called a complaint,
with a©rvt@@ like our adversary proceeding before the court
in North Carolina, fe© foreclose & mortgage.
This procedure and the adversary proceedings allow
you to, quote, recover property or money; to determine the
validity or priority or extent ©f a lien or ©fchor interest
in property? to sell property fr@© ©f a lien or other interest?
to object to ©r revoke a discharge? t© obtain an injunction?
to obtain relief from a stay ~ that is the injunction under
rule 401 or 406 — @r to determine fete dischargability of a

debt.»
That adversary proceeding sectionrule 701, and
part 7, is the whole mechanical ©r procedural sotup in the
Bankruptcy Act, in

the bankruptcy

court, whereby a mortgagee

goes into court, seeks an order from the bankruptcy court to
allow him to foreclose on his mortgage under state law.
We believe that adversary proceeding section of the
Bankruptcy Act is the critical part of this case.

method or mechanics os procedure, whatever you want to sail

during th© straight bankruptcy or liquidation part of th®
bankruptcy proceeding.
But even during the arrangement, what I wanted to
emphasise is, the adversary proceeding is available to all

creditors»

And in fast that does stop a lot of arrangements

because one of the creditors better secured, that is secured,
does not go along, and he files an adversary proceeding.
W© suggest that the petitioners took no comparable
or analogous action in the bankruptcy court under rula 701
that is comparable to

tb,® state law of North Carolina.

W® think that the local law is the law that should
be followed in the bankruptcy courts, where the site of the
property is.

That8s where everybody knows, or should know,

what the law is.
And that is what we believe should be applied in
this case.
And ©van if the property had been abandoned, that
does not automatically give him title or give him a lien on
the rents. - That.simply is not the North Carolina law.
And w© suggest that abandonment really is immaterial.
And back up just a minute to — I might say that during the
arrangement that was ©a @,g@nfe, a disbursing agent.

And the

preamble to that petition to appoint Simon Joseph Golan as
an agent said that there was only on© employee left and that
th®r© needed to be somebody there to disburse the funds, to
collect and disburse the funds.
It was not a receiver in any bankruptcy sens©.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Your Honor, if I could have just a

Two minutes remaining.

Two moments, yes, sir.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. STEVEN BRACKETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRACKETT:

First of all, I'd like to address

myself to Mr. Justice Stevens* questions.
the fact that

That is, I appreciate

he brought to the Court's attention that this

affidavit would take up a substantial part, perhaps two-thirds
of the government *s brief in this case, and their argument
regarding equity in the property was filed on November the
11th, or was prepared and signed by the trustee on November
the 11th.
And the decision of the district court judge was on
November the 12th»

I frankly do not think that that was

even considered by the district court judge, and it is a
hindsight look at what happened after the petitioner got the
property.
And we argue and contend it should not be considered
in any decision of this

.Court.

Secondly, it's clear from the record in this case
that there was no equity in this property.

If that is a

consideration of the Court, it's clear that there was no
equity.

At the first sale* even according to the government's
figures, the deficiency on tha petitioner's debt was
substantially more than at the second sale.
Now the trustee would argue that the fact that
there was a bankruptcy order involved in that allowing the
petitioner to bid in his second deed of trust chilled the
competitive bidding.
In fact, the sale brought more money at the second
sale than it did at the first sale.
There was clearly no equity in this case.

I ask

that the Court look at the first meeting of creditors in the
appendix.

And — where the trustee who has argued before

this Court today stated that in his opinion there was no equity
in the property? that it was clear there was no equity in the
property as in December.
The particular argument that I want to address
myself — my attention to the Court is that —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do that very briefly.

Your time has expired.
MR. BRACKETT:

Yes, sir.

Pardon me, Your Honor.

I would like to reiterate Justice Bryan's dissent
in the 4th Circuit regarding continuation of whether this
was during or after bankruptcy.

question?

QUESTION:

Can I take five seconds and ask you one

MR. BRACKETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

If there had been an abandonment, what

would that have done to the second mortgage indebtedness
when you requested it?
MR. BRACKETT:

I think that it would have extinguished

the second mortgage indebtednesss.
QUESTION:

Entirely?

MR. BRACKETT:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:02 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.1
