ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 78-329

MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
My name is Garrick Cole.

I am an. Assistant Attorney

10

General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

11

you today on behalf of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth

12

and its District Attorneys, the named Defendants in this matter

14
15

X appear before

The Attorney General was sued because he is the chiefi
law enforcement officer charged with enforcement of the statute
After summarizing briefly the prior proceedings in

16

this case, reviewing the results of the abstention process and

17

stating the significant facts, I propose to concentrate my

18

argument this afternoon on two questions:

19

should consider the statute constitutional on its face, and

20

whether the District Court's remedy, a declaration of the total

21

unconstitutionally and an injunction against enforcement of

22

any aspect of the statute in the first trimester, the second

23

trimester, the third trimester, as to immature minors or as to

24

mature minors

Whether the Court

i
1

Wg are content to rely upon the arguments in our

2

briefs concerning the other issues, the District Court's hand­

3

ling of discovery and the matter of costs on appeal in this

4

Court, on our prior appeal.

5

As the Court may review from the briefs, this matter

6

was commenced in 197^ In the District of Massachusetts befor4

7

a three-judge district court, as a civil rights action seeking

8

invalidation of a state statute.

9

to

The Court had this case before it for decision in
July of 1976 in which it vacated the District Court's decision
/

11

on abstention grounds and sent it back for further proceedings.

12

Those further proceedings occurred in 1977 and the case was re­

13

tried in October of 1977.

14

entered its decision, an order which we seek review of in this

15

Court here today, enjoining the enforcement of the statute in

16

its entirety and declaring the statute unconstitutional on its

17

face.

In May of 1978, the District Court

18

Now, the process of abstention, which this Cou.r*t di»

19

rected the District Court pursue, has had a substantial impact

20

on the Issues that are before us today.

tion, the meaning of the statute is now clear and its purposes

Is there possible disagreement as to this

MR. COLE:

I am sorry, Your Honor, as to fche meaning

now?

11
12

QUESTION:

of fche statute?

13

QUESTION:

No, as to just what you said, that fche

14

15

statute.

MR. COLS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I believe not.

I

17

believe that the Supreme Judicial Court's opinion on this in

T8

this regard Is quite definite, that the judge's decision ~

19

QUESTION:

That’s the way I read it, but I wondered

20

whether you knew, as between counsel on the opposing side of

2.1

the podium, whether there is any disagreement as to this.

22

Maybe I'll ask them.

23

MR. COLE:

Perhaps, you might, Your Honor.

I think

24

they may make an argument that — well, I'll let them make that

25

argument, whatever argument it may be.

li

6
1

QUESTION:

Well, anyway, what the court clearly also

2

held was that the District Judge was not permitted to find that

3

this was a mature minor, capable of -- equivalent to an adult

4

so far as being able to decide her best interests by her own

5

lights, and that was sufficient, therefore, to approve the

6

abortion»

7

It had to say that — Your Supreme Judicial Court

8

held that no, that's not enough and that's not the judge's

9

function.

The judge's function is to decide,even if this is

10

equivalent to an adult woman so far as maturity and ability to

11

make her own decisions, that nonetheless it is the judge's

12

function to decide, in his opinion, whether it is in the best

13

interest of this person to have the abortion.

14

isn’t it?

That's correct,

15

MR. COLE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

And I think that is one of the issues

17
18

between you.
MR. COLS:

Well, let me just suggest why I don't thint

19

that means that an answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question

20

should have been different.

21

QUESTION:

I didn't suggest it should have.

22

MR. COLE:

I think it is important in responding to

23

your question that we realize that the Supreme Judicial Court

24

placed its comments in that regard in a context.

25

that assuming that this requirement, this purpose on the part

And it said

7
1

of the Superior Court judge is constitutional* then we believe

2

that it is consonant with the long-es tab lished tradition of

3

judicial supervision over the welfare of minors that the Court

4

not stop simply at a finding of maturity of informed under­

5

standing*, but rather look and see whether there are things

6

which it sees which the child or adolescent may not see* for

7

whatever reason* and make a determination on that basis.

8
9
10
11

So* I think* for that reason the Supreme Judicial
Court's suggestion as to the judge's proper role is consonant
once again with the tradition for which this statute stands.
QUESTION:

I suspect* for the purposes of your case*

12

you might be willing to accept the very emphatic argument that

13

you just heard in the preceding case* that a 16 year-old is

14

not capable of making any decision affecting his rights or

15

her rights* alone and without advice.

16

MRo COLS:

Well* Your Honor* we don't share that view,

17

I don’t think the evidence supports that view.

18

District Court found* however* and the expert testimony is that

19

age does bear relationship to the ability of a child or adoles­

20

cent to make an informed decision* that the older the child*

21

generally the more probable is -~

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

I think the

You are not arguing for any per se rule*

in any event?
MRo COLE:
certainly not.

No* Your Honor* we are not.

We are

8

QUi^TION:

But* as I understand It — I want to be

sure I do understand it, because it is quite important to me.
Your Supreme Judicial Court held that even though the

4

trial judge finds that this particular minor is the equivalent

5

of a rational, mature adult, so far as declsion°making goes,

6

nonetheless, since she is in fact a minor, then the District

7

Judge, despite her ish to have an abortion, can say, "1 find It

8

is in your best interest not to," which of course he could not

9

do if she were, In fact, an adult.

10

MR„ COLE:

That's absolutely true, Your Honor, he

11

could not do that if she were an adult. And the Supreme Judicia

12

Court's suggestion in its. opinion Is that the Superior Court

13

should perform that function if it is constitutional to do so.

14

Vie suggest that, under our analysis of the situation,

15

It ought to be constitutional for the judge to do that, because

16

maturity, in the sense of informed understanding, is not always

17

a guarantee — indeed, I would suspect in this area it is

18

virtually no guarantee at all

19

has the life experience, has the understanding of the abortion

20

decision which a judge who is familiar with these problems,

21

perhaps over a sequence of cases may acquire.

22

QUESTION:

that an adolescent or a child

It is undoubtedly true that most adults

23

during the course of their lifetime make decisions which are

24

foolish decisions, but a free society allows them to do so,

25

and protects them in doing so.

9
1

jMRo

COLS:

Absolutely, Your Honor, and I think, as

2

this Court has recognized in other contexts, it is the peculiar

3

circumstances of minority which sometimes justify, Indeed, do

4

justify the state's taking a more protective role than it other­

5

wise would be permitted to do in the case of an adult.

6

And I believe that the SJC’s suggestion in that

7

regard, Your Honor, is consistent with this Court’s observation

8

in other contexts,

9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

Mr, Cole, just straighten me out.

If this mature minor were a widow, the situation woulc
be different, would it not?
MR. COLE:

Well, the situation is that — Your Honor

13

is referring to Section 12(f) of the statute, and the answer

14

is yes, as a result of the provision, except for the proposi­

15

tion that Section 12(f) does not apply to abortions.

16

fact that -- and I think I should perhaps explore that point

17

at this point, so that you understand it.

18

So the

Section 12(f) is a general, as the Supreme Judicial

19

Court says in its opinion, legislative mature minor rule.

But

20

it applies only in a very limited set of circumstances.

It

21

applies only to those minors who meet its six criteria.

And

22

they are narrow criteria.

23

common law notion of emancipation, but they go a little broader.

24

But they are still quite narrow.

25

face» does not apply, as a result, to the vast majority of

To some degree they codify the

And Section 12(f), on its

i
10
1

children* male or female* who live with their families in

2

Massachusetts.

3

Now* it is also true* Mr. Justice Blackmun* that it

4

does not apply to abortion or sterilization* neither does

5

Section 12(e)* dealing with methadone maintenance.
The Legislature has made a determination — and we

6

7

suggest one which ought to be within its constitutional power

8

to do --- that some health care decisions* maybe a lot of them*

9

maybe ones which include very serious surgical procedures or

10

other things of that nature* ought to be within the adolescent's,

11

ability to decide for his or herself* and others should not.

12

And abortion* sterilization and methadone maintenance are three

13

of those legislatively singled out severe and controversial

14

decisions which the Legislature has determined an adolescent or

15

child should not be able to decide.

16

As a result of the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling*

17

we suggest that there are only two questions of substantive

18

quality before the Court.

19

because

20

and notice in every case* all cases* and is it invalid* on its

21

face*simply because it requires parent© who attend mature,minors

22

adhere to the same requirements which govern the conduct of

23

physicians who attend immature minors?

24
25

First* is the statute invalid simply

on its face now — it requires parental consultation

Now* the appreciation of the narrowness of these
questions* it seems to me -- narrowness which derives from the

I

11
1

process of abstention, Is a helpful basis for turning to a

2

consideration of the facts at issue in this case.

3

The facts are important, we believe, because they

4

show the tenor and complexity of the judgment which the

5

Legislature has made.

6

nature, however, because we are not talking about an "as

7

applied" attack, not talking about any Individual minors, we

8

are talking about the general power of the Legislature.

They are predominantly legislative in

9

Skipping briefly through them, I want to suggest to

to

the Court that pregnancy among adolescents is an increasingly

11

serious and common phenomenon.

12

adolescents, between the ages of 15 and 19 become pregnant

13

each year, and approximately 30,000 adolescents, under the

14

age of 15, become «—

15
16

25

who has

As a person who has no parental — yes,

The statute deals with the parents who

have left home, parents who have deserted their child.
QUESTION:

I am talking about the child who gets an

apartment and lives by herself.

23
24

MR. COLE:

QUESTION:

21
22

How about a young, -— below 18

the statute deals with that, Mr. Justice Marshall.

QUESTION:

17

Approximately one million

MR. COLS:

Right.

I am sorry, your question prompts

my memory.
In the SJC opinion, there is a mention «•- and perhaps

12
1

my associate can find it for me »- of a situation in which

2

no substitute parent is available* and the situation there

3

would be that -- I suppose that someone either who could

4

perform that function would do it for the child on the child's

5

behalf —

6

QUESTION:

Here's a child who is living by herself,

7

taking care of herself and not depending on anybody.

8

business is it except her's?

9

from the ordinary case,

10

11

MR, COLS:

Whose

It seems like a lot different

I agree with you.

What you are really

talking about* I suppose* in the common law notion —

12

QUESTION:

Is the exception,

13

MR, COLS:

— is the emancipated minor situation,

14

I see the thrust of that argument.

The Legislature's

15

judgment is that abortion is a terribly difficult consideration,

16

And a child who is able to make many other decisions, indeed*

17

virtually all of them on her own behalf* may fiipd herself

18

totally at sea when she faces this one.

19

QUESTION:

20

she gets over that.

21

MR. COLE:

22

I understand your point* Your Honor.

23

QUESTION: M guess the real question is that some

24

people that you and I know are mature at 17 and some people

25

who are not mature at 30.

Yes* but she also has to face suicide and

If she doesn't do it.

I guess that’s the answer* isn't it?

13

MR. COLS:

Itk absolutely true* Your Honor* and

we use bright lines* somewhat arbitrary distinctions.

is no question about it.

We turn to the facts in this case.

It is 360 Northeastern 2d 294
The evidence

10

establishes that abortion surgery* although it Is*from a

medical risk point of vlevj* relatively safe, is not without

12

its hazards.

13

rates vary from ^ of 1$ to as much as 5^ for abortions per­

15

They are much higher when one considers abortions performed

16

And the evidence indicates that complication

The evidence also establishes that pregnancy and

of evidence in the briefs of Appellees in this case concerning

We feel this matter, as Judge Aldrich ruled at trial, was an

issue not relevant to a facial attack, and therefore we do not

think that it is a matter which the Court should properly con»

narrow criticisms.

17

tradition recognized In the law and Mr. Justice Stevens'

18

opinions and the opinions of Mr. Justice Brennan'in the Carey

case, note the importance of parental counseling.

20

parties all agree that supportive parental counseling is in

21

the best interest of minors.

22

Our argument is that it's a longstanding

And the

So we start from that proposition.

The evidence also contains support of the importance

23

of parental support in the minds of professionals.

The Americai

24

Academy of Pediatrics — as the Court may be aware from reading

25

our brief and looking at the record — in 1973 had before it

the question precisely of whether minors, adolescents and

2

children, should be able to consent to the performance of

3

abortion and sterilization on their own behalf.

testimony and exhibits on file indicate that the American

Academy of Pediatrics decided the answer to that question ought

to be no.

is "supportive," isn't it?

MR. COLE;

Yes, Your Honor, that’s quite so.

And I

am going to turn to that question right now.

12

Of what, then, do Plaintiffs complain?

Am I not correct your statute requires

it irrespective of whether or not it is supportive?
MR. COLE;

Your Honor, on its face, the statute

applies to the relationship, does not probe beneath it, and

19

yes, consultation is required, even though some parents may not

be supportive.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT IN NO. 78-330

Mrs. Hunerwadel is the mother of three unmarried
girls of child-bearing ageD

At the time this action was com­

10

menced, she had no knowledge of the true identity of Mary Moe.

It

She was permitted to intervene on behalf of herself and as

12

representative of a class of Massachusetts parents, having

13

minor girls of child-bearing age who are or who might become

14

pregnant and choose not to inform their parents as to the

15

nature of their pregnancy and as to whether or not they were

16

going to seek an abortion.

17

The Intervenor contends that the Massachusetts statutes,

18

as Interpreted by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Judicial

19

Court, is constitutional on its face.

20

that the Massachusetts statute is constitutional because it

21

reflects a long line of decisions of this Court holding that

22

parents have the primary right, duty and obligation to provide

23

guidance and protection to their minor children.

The Intervenor contends

24

This Court has only Interfered with the primary right

25

and duty of parents when the parents have not acted in the best

Interest of their minor children.

Typically, these girls are scared, they are frightened, they

are desperate.

16

All of the experts agreed that for a minor girl an

One of the experts described these girls as upset,

17

withdrawn, noncommunicative and anxious.

Expert testimony also

18

reveals that such girls are compelled to seek an immediate

solution to the problem.

20

And yet the experts state in this case that immediate relief

21

is not proper.

In short, they want immediate relief.

There ought to be a period of reflection.

22

This is where the role of the parents becomes critic­

majority of parents will give support and guidance to their

children.

They also agreed that parental support and involvement

instance.

to have the abortion that it is the product of reflection and

We are attempting to demonstrate to the Court why

the broad sweep of the statute Is beneficial to the child.
Inbred In the statute and consistent with previous cases of
this Court, if the parents fail, if the parents don't accomplish
what they are under a duty to perform, then the state can move
in.

And I think once the state moves in they are acting in the

best interest of tEe minor girl.
Never once has this Court ever advanced the theory
that the child should become removed from both the state, removed from the family and placed into the hands of a third party
who is in no way responsible, either legally, by the parentchild relationship, or by the parens patriae relationship
of the state, for the welfare of that child in the long run.
But the facts of this case demonstrate the need °»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH J. BALLIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLESS
MR. BALLIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Joseph Balliro.

I will address the Court

with respect to those Issues involved in Appellees' brief
concerned with the undue burdens, in the context of the due

25

process argument.
My colleague* Mr. Henn, will address the Court on
behalf of the Appellees with respect to the equal protection
arguments.
At the outset, I'd like to say that it should be
emphasized that this is a criminal statute that effectively
prevents, by its sanctions, the minor from obtaining access to
abortion facilities that she may want in order to terminate a
pregnancy,
QUESTION:

Against whom do the criminal sanctions

run?
MR. BALLXRO:

The ones performing the abortions,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Not against the minor?

MR. BALLIRQ:

Not against the minor.

I might point out in response to Justice Stewart's
question, that the penalties provide for fines between $100
and $2,000, and were the maximum or practically any amount of
those fines imposed it would effectively preclude abortion
facilities being available for the overwhelming majority of
minors,
QUESTION:

That is minors who have not received the

consent of their parents?
MR. BALLIRO:
QUESTION:

Who don't have a great deal of money.

Well, now, this doesn't talk anything about

26

money®

Ifc is jusfc talking about consent of parents®
MR® BALLIRO:
QUESTION:

not?

That's correct®

It might be in a free clinic* might ifc

I take it you have some free clinics in Massachusetts®
MR® BALLIRO:

We nofc only have free clinics* but

even clinics run by the Appellees in this case* Mr. Chief
Justice* provide in a very substantial percentage of cases
free services for those who they are satisfied are indigent*
,

.

/

*

*•. ..

and the record amply demonstrates that.
QUESTION:

Are those free clinics supported by the

State of Massachusetts or by private funding or federal, do
you know?
MR® BALLIRO:
Commonwealth of

Nona of them are supported either by the

Massachusetts or by federal funding®

As a matter of fact* I can't think offhand* Your
Honor* of any entirely free clinic* but with respect to the
existing clinics that provide abortion services* almost all
of them in one way or another* or to some extent or another*
will afford Indigenfcs free services.
To a greater degree* if Your Honor pleases* with
respect to the Appellees in this case, and more often than
nofc* other existing abortion facilities in Massachusetts
will refer indigents to the Appellee clinic in this case®
In a long line of cases* beginning perhaps as early
as Griswold* this Court has clearly established that the right

27

to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is a funda­
mental rights constitutionally protected and Insulated from
interference unless warranted by some compelling state interest.
And in Bellotti v. Baird* this Court recognized that the un­
married minor has a fundamental right to an abortion and that
that right cannot be unduly burdened.
V/hen this case first came before this Court, the
burdens imposed by the statute were somewhat unclear.

And 1

don't think that it makes too much difference, Your Honors,
whether or not it was unclear either because of the representa­
tions that were made concerning the interpretation of the
statute at that time by the Attorney General's office, or
whether they were unclear as a result of the fact that the
District Court failed to abstain.

But the fact of the matter

is that we now have the benefit or the answers provided by the
Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to
some nine questions that were certified to it.
And 1 would suggest respectfully that those burdens
fall generally into two categories.

First, those required by

the necessity for two-parent consent, and those required by
what the District Court described and which we adopt as judicial
override.
The statute first requires that the minor obtain
the consent of both parents.

And it makes no difference that

the minor is mature and capable of giving an informed consent.

28

It makes no difference that her physician may agree with her, or
that concerned friends** adults i- or otherwise, may agree with
her.

It makes no difference whether or not one or both of the

parents have previously expressed views that very strongly in­
dicate the probability of aggression or hostility toward the
child, were she ever to get pregnant.

And, as a matter of

fact, this —
QUESTION:

A minor in Massachusetts, for this purpose,

is a girl 18 or younger or —
MR. BALLIRO:
QUESTION:

Under 18, Your Honor»

If she's reached her eighteenth birthday,

she's not a minor?
MR. BALLIRO:

She's an adult.

And as a matter of fact, this record, with respect
to the Appellee Mary Moe, describes exactly that kind of
hostility and aggression having been expressed by at least one
of her parents, her father, who she testified had indicated
that — this was before she was pregnant

that If she ever

got pregnant, he was likely to kill her boy friend.
It makes no difference if the parents have expressed
unalterable views that are opposed to abortion.

Even if those

views Include the forcing of her carrying to term as punishment
for whatever transgression the parent might feel the child did
by becoming pregnant.

And it makes no difference if the

parents have been separated for years and one or the other or

29

both have never displayed any warmth, any love or any affection
for the child.

The only exception to that, as far as the

statute Is concerned, is with respect to the legal definition
of desertion, whether or not one of the parents has deserted
the other parent.

And it makes no difference, if it please

the Court, if the most renowned physician or group of physicians
or psychiatrists were to attest to irreparable or long-lasting
harm to the minor if forced unreasonably or arbitrarily or
against her will to have an abortion.
And, according to the statute as it is written, in
the face of that kind of overwhelming interest as to what would
be in the best interest of the child, even a dispassionate
judge could not order that that abortion proceed without
notification and consultation of the parents, both of them.
In short, this statute that talks in terms of a
good cause and the statute that the Supreme Judicial Court of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts discussed in terms of both
the court and parents conducting themselves in a manner that
would be to the best Interest of the child, would compel noti“
fication, consultation and the obtaining of consent of both
parents, in total disregard of what every thinking person in
a significant number of cases,I submit, would agree was totally
irrational and dangerously harmful both to the child, herself,
and very well to her parents, as the record in this case shows,
because that judge would be forced to direct that notification

30
of that pregnancy be made to parents* even though* for example,
one of them may be suffering from a very severe heart condi­
tion that could very well be triggered into something a lot
more serious were that parent to find out that its child was
pregnant.
As far back as Roe v. Wade, and reaffirmed by this
Court in Carey v. Population Services, this Court has spoken
in terms of the necessity of there being a compelling state
interest as necessary to Justify regulation of a right so
fundamental as whether to bear a child* and that more impor­
tantly, any such regulation be narrowly drawn.
Now, far from being narrowly drawn, we suggest that
obbiously the two-parent consent requirement of this statute,
is about as broadly drawn as any statute could be*.
QUESTION:

Mr. Balliro, Just to use that as an

example, as I remember the Supreme Judicial Court's comments
on the case, they suggested that if the statute were too
broadly construed the federal court might sustain its con­
stitutionality only in part, rather than taking it as a whole.
What would be wrong with the view that the court should have
simply held the two-parent consent unconstitutional, or maybe
unconstitutional as applied to the mature minor, but that the
statute should be saved with respect to the immature minor,
wherein at least in cases where the consent of one parent might
be supportive, or at least consultation?

Is it necessary to

31
examine the whole thing on a facial basis, in other words?
MR, BALLIRO:

I believe that it is, and I would

adopt the District Court finding in that respect, and more
particularly its description of the Supreme Judicial Court's
method of saving part — the major part of the constitutionality
of this statute by its chameleon change of color to satisfy
whatever this Court might feel was necessary in order for any
part of it to survive constitutionally, is not a view of
severability that I can adopt,

I would adopt the District

Court's view, Justice Stevens, with respect to —
QUESTION:

I am sure you would, but do you want to

try and persuade us why we should do it?
MR. BALLIRO:

Well, first of all, I think, you

wouldn't be doing justice to the Legislature of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts,

I think if you did that you would then wind

up with a statute that was directly contrary to what the ex~
pressed view of the Legislature of the Commonwealth was, that
there be a two-parent consent.

And I don't think it should be

the function of the federal court to make that kind of a dis­
tortion.
QUESTION:

The highest court of the state has said

if we can't have the total picture that has been presented,
we want as much of it as can possibly be saved.
MR. BALLIRO:
said

That's what the Supreme Judicial Court

32

QUESTION:

That's the highest court of Massachusetts,

MR» BALLIRO:

That's correct, but that's not the

Legislature.
QUESTION:

But our cases have said many times that

when the Supreme Court of a state speaks interpreting a statute
it’s just as if the legislature had spoken.
QUESTION:

They have said what the Legislature

provided.
MR. BALLIRO:

Well, Justice RehnquIst and Mr. Chief

Justice, perhaps the greatest difficulty I have with severing
out that portion of the legislative requirement is in my strong
feelingthat with respect to the rest of the statute, in almost
every aspect that so unduly burdens that it would not survive
if that were to be done anyway.
QUESTION:

Well,that's a separate argument.

MR. BALLIRO:
QUESTION:

But it's my answer to your question.

Mr. Balliro, have you ever known of another

instance where your Supreme Judicial Court has said this is the
way the statute is construed, but if it isn't all right and
the Federal Court thinks it ought to go another way, we will
go along that way?

Is this common in the halls of the Supreme

Judicial Court of Massachusetts?
MR. BALLIRO:

Your Honor, it is not only uncommon

in Massachusetts, nor do I know of any other instance with
respect to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where the Supreme

33
Judicial Court has evern spoken in that sense.

But I don't

know of any other decision* at least I've never been acquainted
with one, in which—
QUESTION:

Well, there are a couple of ex-Harvard

law professors on that court, and I wondered If this is what
they are teaching these days.
MR. BALLIRO:

I don't think they teach that at

Harvard, if Your Honor pleases.
Conceding the uncontradicfced fact that parental
guidance is a desirable, nonetheless the also uncontradicted
fact in this record is that in an appreciable number of cases
the requirement of obtaining parental consent of both parents

will lead to a disaster either for the child, the parents or
both.
1 note, Mr. Chief Justice, that my time is up.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Henn.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOHN H. HENN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. HENN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

C ourfc:
My name is John Henn, and I represent the Appellees

Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and others in this
case.
The Massachusetts Statute Section 12(s) singles out
the unmarried minor who chooses abortion for imposition of a

34
uniquely burdensome and discriminatory set of restrictions.
What the state has done is to Invidiously classify into one
group all minors who have never been married and who want an
abortion and into the other group every other kind of minor.
Now, these other kinds of minors consist of, first,
any minor who wants to continue her pregnancy; second, any
minor who has ever been married and who wants an abortion; and
third, any minor who wants any kind of medical treatment, how­
ever .serious, other than abortion.
For all these other minors, Massachusetts either has
no requirement of parental involvement at all, or has require­
ments which are much 2ess burdensome than those imposed by
Section 12(s).
Now, let me illustrate this.

The case of the minor

who wants to continue her pregnancy is obviously the most
simple.

She faces no requirements of parental involvement

whatever, regardless of her maturity.
The case of the minor who is or ever has been married
and who wants an abortion is also simple.

Under the Massachu­

setts Qaancipated Minor Statute, Section 12(f), she is exempted
from all parental Involvement requirements regardless of her
maturity.
QUESTION:

Is it possible, under Massachusetts law,

this statute or any other, for a parent to compel the child to
submit to an abortion?

35
MR. HENN:

It is not# Your Honor.

QUESTION:

The law makes all sorts of distinctions

between married and unmarried people, minors# doesn't it?
I mean until a person is married and during his or her minority#
under the ordinary concepts of common law, his or her parents
speak for the minor.

After marriage that's no longer true,

and that's been from time immemorial recognized by the law.
There are all sorts of distinctions made# depending on that
difference in status# aren't there?
MR. HENN:

There are a number of distinctions with

respect to minority# obviously.
QUESTION:

And with respect to marriage.

MR. HENN:

And with respect to marriage.

But I am

focusing now in the medical treatment area# and I want to
distinguish how uniquely Massachusetts has treated only the
minor who has the status of being unmarried and who wants the
treatment of abortion.
QUESTION:

It treats unmarried minors differently

from married minors in many# many other different ways# doesn't
it?
MR. HENN:

It does# Your Honor.

QUESTION:

The very concept of emancipation does

so# does it not?
MR. HENN:

That does# Your Honor# and emancipation
_}

has now been statutorily codified.

So that# if I may turn to

36
the third case of the minor who wants any form of medical
treatment whatever, other than abortion, from plastic surgery
to amputation, she may obtain that in one of three ways, all
of which are more liberal than what the unmarried minor wanting
an abortion uniquely faces.

That minor who wants some other

medical treatment may, If she fits within one of the protected
categories of the emancipated minor statute, be exempted from
all parental involvement whatever, regardless of her factual
maturity. Even if she does not fit within the statute, she can
if mature be exempted,under the common law mature minor rule,
from all parental Involvement, at least if her doctor decides
that parental notification is against her best interest.
And finally, if she neither falls under the statute
nor under the common law rule, she will have to obtain the
consent of but one parent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Henn, these are all equal protection

arguments, as I understand it.

The remedy for that, I suppose,

would be to enjoin the enforcement of the statute to the extent
that there is any disparity.

In other words, change it to

require one parent consent or, in the case of mature minor,,
hold it invalid as to that.
MR. HENN:

In response to that and in response

your earlier question to Mr.. Balliro, with respect to preserva­
tions of some portion of the statute, we suggest that this
statute cannot be preserved.

First, for the reason my brother

37
already mentioned, namely that the state court has authorita­
tively spoken as to the legislative intent.

Second, that it

would be unprecedented for the federal court to take a statute,
eliminate its construction and, indeed, its text,and Rewrite it;
and third, you would have here, by way of the construction sug­
gested, distinguishing between mature and immature minor, a
criminal statute, which would make a physician's potential
exposure to criminal liability turn on whether he correctly
assessed maturity versus immaturity,

just as this last-month

this Court considered a statute where a physician could or
could not be criminally liable, depending on how he assessed
the question of viability.
Each of those questions are questions on which
experts have differed.
QUESTION:

I suppose the doctors have to make that

precise judgment in the non-abortion area, in the cases you
just described.
MR. HENN:

They do.

They do, Your Honor, but they

do only with respect to exposure to a potential battery suit
in connection with an immature minor.
The result of the Massachusetts overall system Is
that for any case you can think of, except the unmarried minor
wanting an abortion, Massachusetts law either leaves it up to
the minor and her physician or at most requires one parent's
consent

38
Section 12(a) stands in stark contrast to this other­
wise liberal approach.

Under Section 12(a) and only under that

statute, an umarried minor can actually be forced to bear an
unwanted child.

And the consequence of letting the statute go

into effect, as the facts found by the District Court show,
which have not been challenged as clearly erroneous, the con­
sequence would be to deter unmarried minors from seeking legal
abortions, to force some of them to travel out of state or
into the hands of back-room abortionists, and to force still
others to bear unwanted and usually illegitimate children.
QUESTION:

But your argument is it is irrational, or

close to that, for the Legislature to say that the abortion
decision Is different from these other medical decisions?
MR. HENN:

In terms of all of the range of other

abortion decisions, it is probably —
QUESTION:

But you are saying that distinction be­

tween abortions and other medical procedures, where consent
of only one parent is required, that the Legislature could not
rationally consider one of those decisions more serious than
the other.
. s

MR, HENN:

I think the test would be a test of more

heightened scrutiny, namely the significant state Interest test,
but I think it is even Irrational to single abortion out where
there is still a system which provides substantially the same
kind of protection for minors who at least are incapable of

39
making decisions.

That is, the common law rule does not say

that a minor incapable of consenting to abortion can, neverthe­
less, get an abortion.

The common law rule is still the common

law rule of battery which would -QUESTION:

I was focusing on the cases outside the

common law rule, those where you do not have a mature minor.
Your objection there is »MR. HENN:

There are two common law rules, Your Honor.

There is the new mature minor common law rule -•=
QUESTION:
not a mature minor.

Let's take the case of the minor who is
Your argument is that in medical procedures,

other than abortion, the consent of one parent is sufficient,
whereas the consent of two parents is required in the abortion
case.

And you are saying there is no valid distinction between

abortions and other medical procedures that would justify a
difference in the kind of parental consent required.
MR. HENN:

There at least is no significant state

interest in that distinction because the two-parent consent
rule here is not only implementally burdensome in itself, adding
an additional consent requirement, but it triggers the minor's
exposure to all the other burdens of the statute.

For example,

the discriminatory burden of judicial veto, where in the case
other than abortion a minor may obtain the medical treatment
she wants upon the concurrent consents of herself, to the ex­
tent of her capacity, one parent and. her physician.

But

40

uniquely, under this statute, a judge may veto those concurrent
consents, even if the other parent has not opposed to abortion
in court, but merely declines to execute the required consent
form.

And the statute requires that a consent form be executed0
Now, Your Honor -QUESTION:

Mr. Henn, it probably is not terribly

important, but I wonder If, either in presentations to the
Legislature or the arguments in the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts, there was expression of any kind about the
predicament of the physician who performs the abortion after
this Supreme Judicial Court decision, assuming it is sustained,
who is later confronted with a malpractice suit or a battery
suit by a 14 year-old, 15 year-old girl after she has matured,
several years later, on the grounds that she was incapable of
giving consent, and therefore it would be a battery, in most
states, if there was no adequate consent.
MR. HENN:

If Section 12(s) were invalidated, I

think ~ In other words, if the District Court opinion in
this case were upheld, then I think the physician would have a
good faith defense, under the, I believe, the third paragraph
of Section 12(f), which in my view ought to apply, which would
provide a good faith defense, either if he was reasonably misled by the minor as to her competence or misled as to her age.
Otherwise, it is and, Indeed, would be the common law rule as
to all medical procedures, comparing the common law mature miner

41

rule with the more traditional common law battery rule* that a
physician's judgment* with respect to maturity* is subject to
exposure* if he errs and decides the minor is mature*, to a possible battery suit.
I think there should properly be a good faith defense
in that* and I can't say the common law itself is clear* in
part because the mature minor rulevas only announced in this
case by the Supreme Judicial Court.
Now, the deterrent burdens which my brother,
Mr. Balllro, has discussed at some length, are ones which, in
our view, make this statute a statute which is not saved from
the Court's holding in Danforth.
The suggestion has been that Section 12(s), its
provision for going to court as an alternative, somehow makes
this case different from Drmforth, but the burdens of going
to court were found as a fact to be severely detrimental.

And

I call the Court's attention to the finding at pages 1001 and
1002 of 450 P.Supp. in this case.

Those findings were that the

burden of going to court is a "heavy burden," that an expert
witness testified credibly and without contradiction that going
to court would be severely detrimental to the minor, testified
that most minors at least if obliged to get parents' consent
would not -- or many minors -- go to court, but instead would
seek illegal alternatives! arKj quite importantly found that if
a minor did go to court, she was in an impossible situation.

42

If she prevailed, that is,;she beat her parents in court, that
was hardly going to help her family situation.

And if she lost,

if her parents forced her to bear an unwanted child, that was
hardly going to help her family situation either.
Now, Your Honors, I would like to turn to the suggested
state interest which Appellants have proposed in this case.
The first suggested state interest is that of protecting against
immature decision-making.
I submit this state interest is already met by
existing Massachusetts law which provides for physicians to
make individual assessments of maturity, and surely a require­
ment of parental notice when by hypothesis against the minor8®
best interest, not to mention judicial veto of a'mature minor's
decision, have nothing whatever to do with protecting against
immature decision-making.

Indeed, were

the state truly

,T

concerned to prevent immature decisions, this statute is
obviously under-inclusive.

It does not impose any requirements

even of consultation or counseling on any minor who wants to
have a child, however foolish or Immature that wish may be.
And similarly, this statute sweeps far beyond any
requirement of encouraging parental consultation.

It requires

consent or notice of a lawsuit in every case, even if, by
hypothesis, harmful to the minor.
An example of a consultation statute is attached to
our brief — Our brief is the buff-colored brief — It is the

43
Maryland statute.

And while the factual workings of that

statute I can't speak to* that is at least an example of the
kind of statute which would encourage consultation in the
normal case but leave it up to the physician to decide whether
to dispense with it in cases where parental notice would be
harmful to the minor.

There are no «judicial proceedings re­

quired* and the physician may not be made criminally liable for
his decision.
As to the matter of remedy* the District Court was
surely correct in invalidating this statute on its face.

The

claims of all unmarried minors who wish abortion were before
the District Court and those are the minors to whom the statute
applies.

There is no "as applied" analysis* therefore* that

would be appropriate and this Court has not applied such
analysis in its review of prior abortion statutes.
In summary* we submit that the District Court properly
invalidated the entire statute* as imposing undue burdens and
unjustified discriminations with respect to a minor's abortion
choice.
Thank you* very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 3:30 o'clock* p.mc the case was
submitted.)
