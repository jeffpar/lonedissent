PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning and first this year in Japan Line, Ltd, v.
County of Los Angeles.
Mr. Briger, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FETER L. BRIGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BRIGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The precise issue to be decided In thi3 case Is
whether the existence of situs through the fiction of an
assumed average presence can be relied upon by appellees so
as to tax foreign containers which are used exclusively In
foreign commerce, are continuously in transit and which the
trial court found had their home port in Japan, so as to
justify a conclusion of continuous presence within appellee’s
jurisdiction.

Such presence is necessary in order to

permit the subjection of containers to an apportioned ad
valorem California property tax.

Such tax, it 13 noted, would

be In addition to full ad valorem property taxes which have
been levied upon the containers at their home port in Japan.
Unless the decision of the California Supreme Court
3s reversed, this case undoubtedly will have profound and
adverse impacts upon the foreign trade relations of the
United States.

Indeed, the court, in requesting the Solicitor

General to express his views on the case, has recognised the
important foreign policy and foreign relations questions
triggered by California's unilateral rejection of the home
port doctrine in the case of foreign owned instrumentalities
used exclusively in foreign commerce.
QUESTION:

Are you arguing both the home port doc­

trine and the customs convention, Mr. Briger?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, I am.

The —

I thought perhaps you —* you tended to

blend them together in that sentence.
MR0 BRIGER:

I do indeed.

I believe that the

customs convention is another indication of the frderal in­
terest in this area and that the home port doctrine was a
means enunciated by this Court more than 130 years ago in
order* to deal with the treatment of the taxation of foreign
owned instrumentalities, that the customs convention is one
of numerous areas of federal expression of its concern in
this area.
QUESTION:

But the home port doctrine is constitu­

tionally based, is it not?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Yes., it is.
And your case would not be as strong

apart from the home port doctrine without the affirmative
adoption of the customs convention, would it?
MR. BRIGER:

I think it probably would be.

What we

5
are arguing is that there are long established customs among
the trading nations of the world which have been recognized
by this Court in its adoption of the Hays v. Pacific Mail
Shipping Company case.

This is a basic commerce clause rule.

And there are reliance interests of foreign governments on
this long accepted policy6

They have based their trade rela­

tions with the United States in connection with the interna­
tional carriage of goods and passengers —
QUESTION:

Well, what is it that they do, relying

cn —
MR. BRIGER:

Well, every country, Your Honor — and

this comes out in the Solicitor General's brief — every
country, with the exception possibly of Afghanistan, in the
treatment of the International carriage of goods and persons
by aircraft, vessels or containers

has followed a policy of

reciprocal exemption from local or national taxes upon these
instrumentalities, and all governments of the world in their
trading relations have observed this policy„
QUESTION:

But it is the legislative branch that

speaks for this country on foreign policy, isn’t it?
MR» BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Indeed.
And Hays

v. Pacific Mail didn't depend

a

on any action of the executive branch, c.id it, or the legis­
lative branch?
MR. BRIGER:

It did not0

But there are really two

6
policies that coalesce.

The Court in the Hays decision at

that time came to this conclusion in order to eliminate the
cumulative burdens of multiple taxation.

There is a clear

statement in that case.
Now, of course, the case was decided before the
apportionment rule became the law for the states and -QUESTION:

Well, Hays wasn't an international case,

was it?
MR. BRIGER:

It dealt with ocean carriage and it

dealt with
QUESTION:

But just between two ports in the United

States —
MR, BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Indeed ~
— and the problem was among states of

the United States.
MR. BRIGER:

Well, Justice White, while the case did

deal —
QUESTION:

Well, give me one that dealt with inter­

national trade.
MR. BRIGER:

Well, we are dealing with international

trade in this case.
QUESTION:

Just give me another one under Hays or

any other one that dealt with international trade.
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

The Court has never dealt with —
Well, that is what I thought.

So to the

extent that Hays was a constitutional rule9 it was a commerce
clause rule and Congress could change it?
MR. BRIGER:

Those were the specific facts in the

Rays case.
QUESTION:

Was the argument about the container con­

vention presented to the California courts?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BRIGER:

No, I don't believe it was. Your Honor.
If It was not, may we consider it here?
There were arguments that various

treaties Invalidated the imposition of the taxs specifically
the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, the General
Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, so that the argument was
made that In general there

were treaty obligations of the

United States which Indicated its Interest in this area of
the international carriage of goods in connection with
foreign owned instrumentalities.
But we would argue that the commerce clause by it­
self gives the federal government without the necessity of
any specific legislation or treaty the exclusive interest

because this is an area that impacts upon the foreign rela­
tions of the United States, and there have been governments
which for more than almost two-hundred years have relied upon
this exemption from taxation»
In fact, we suggest in our brief that the California
constitutional provision exempting domestic owned vessels from

8
taxation was inserted into the California law in recognition
that under the home port doctrine, foreign owned vessels v/ere
accorded that privilege»
It is an area where there has been substantial reli­
ance by foreign governments upon this rule, and that fact is
the —
QUESTION:

Do you think Hays would come out the

same today?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTXON:
MR» BRIGER:

I believe ~
Traffic between two states?
Not at all. Justice White, and that is

because the apportionment rule is the law for all of the
states.
QUESTION:

You are saying that something like the

Fays rule that the Court and everyone thought appropriate for
a long time is still appropriate for international trade?
MR. BRIGER:

Yes, Your Honor, where the apportion­

ment rule cannot be enforced upon foreign governments either
by state and local governments or by the federal government.
And it is really the major thrust of om* argument and the
]ynch pin of our argument would be Standard Oil v. Peck,
where this Court confirmed that the apportionment rule was
the only means by which state and local governments could
impose taxes In connection with interstate commerce.

And

once that rule became the law of the land, it was possible

9
for this Court to eliminate the burdens of multiple taxation
which the Court since the time of Justice Stone has indicated
would clearly be a violation of the commerce clause»
But absent the binding ~
QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't say that there would

be a violation of the commerce clause, would you, if the
international practice had been Just to the contrary?
MR» BRIGER:

Noa Your Honor, not at all, and we

would argue that if there had been an international practice*
whether by practice, custom,, treaty, multilateral agreement,
that that would not then involve the foreign relations of the
United States.
But the point is that for two-hundred years this
country has followed the practice of not imposing local
property taxes upon foreign owned containers»
QUESTION:

Well, you say it wouldn’t involve the

foreign relations of the United States.

Now, supposing that

in the interest of the administration’s human rights policy
it were determined by the executive here in Washington that
s. particular state
prisoners»

government should release particular

Would you say that that is something that the

executive would have power to order the state to do over and
apart from any other substantive granted authority simply
because it furthered the foreign relations of the country?
MR. BRIGER:

It would depend on how significantly9

.10
Justice Rehnquist, it interfered with the foreign relations
of the country.

If it were incidental and the states had a

coextensive jurisdiction, it would be a weighing process.
Here
QUESTION:

Would there be the same reciprocity

factor that we have in international trade in the hypothetical
presented by Mr. Justice Rehnquist?
MR. BRIGER:

Well, this was the point I was just

going to make, Your Honor, that here we are dealing with the
clear situation where in the letter of the State Department,
where they canvassed more than a hundred embassies, there
seems to be a clearly established policy.

I think we would

have a very difficult time if roughly fifty percent of the
nations

were to impose these taxes and fifty percent did not»
QUESTION:

Well, then the authority of a state to

Impose a tax depends on a head count of what other countries
think about It, is that right?
MR. BRIGER:

Not necessarily, Your Honor, but it may.

What I am saying here Is that there —=
QUESTION:

Can you conceive of a country that would

say I think I should be taxed?
MR. BRIGER:

Justice Marshall, that could be.

If

the government ~
QUESTION:
MR. BRIGER:

Do you really think that, please tax me?
Yes, Your Honor, I could see that if

11
the governments decided that apportionment made more sense and
was more rational and they adopted rules through some type of
multilateral treaty.

If, for instance, In connection with

the current trade negotiations it were determined by a group
of nations that it is a more sensible approach to follow
apportionment, I could see —
QUESTION:

Then why not turn it all over to them

and let them decide it all?
MR. BRIGER:

What are you here for?

It might well be a good idea, and it

is our — since there has been
QUESTION:

Would you have to change the Constitution

a little bit?
MR„ BRIGER:

I don't think so at all.

I think that

the states could urge the federal government indeed to enter
into new treaties with foreign governments, and this could be
done as a matter of the treaty of the federal government and
in that sense it might be a. rational way to approach the
problem.
QUESTION:
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BRIGER:

But that is not the way you approach it.
No, Your Honor, that is —
You brought it here.
We brought it here because there has

been this clear custom, and where there has been a custom and
a reliance interest by foreign governments, what we are
suggesting is that the states, even in their power to tax.

12
cannot change a fundamental principle which has been recog­
nized by the International community of nations for more than
two-hundred years, probably longer.
QUESTION:

Well, you are familiar with our Michelin

Tire case, are you not?
MR. BRIGER;
QUESTION:

Yes, I am indeed,
What if the State Department had taken

census of foreign nations in that case and they had come
cut the same way, that they objected to this form of taxation,
do you think Michelin should have come out differently in
this Coux*t?
MR. BRIGER:

No, I think Michelin is correct, and I

think that Michelin — and the Court was very careful to
Indicate in Michelin, by the way, that they would not tax
under the import-export clause or under the commerce clause
propei’ty that was merely in transit.

And I believe the Court

left that exception there because they were concerned with
the burdens of multiple taxation in an area where apportion­
ment was not recognized by our trading partnerse
QUESTION:

Mr, Briger, your reference to this canvas

cf a hundred embassies I take it is not to suggest that we
take a poll of what they think about it, but the implications
of their answer and that those implications are that if you
tax the components of our vessels, we are going to tax the
components of your vessels,

l3nft that —

13
MR. BRIOER:
of it.

Indeed, that is the sum and substance

Also It Is the preceptlon of that department of the

United States government which is charged with foreign rela­
tions s and whether the report is correct or not, it is the
view of that agency which has the responsibility for the
foreign relations of the United States, and it Is important
because this is the perception of the State Department of the
foreign relations question.

It is not a matter of a popularity

contest, but it is the view of that agency charged with the
foreign affairs of the United States and it is making its
comment that it regards the imposition of these taxes as an
event which could have an impact upon the foreign relations
cf the United States.
QUESTION;

Mr. Briger, are you making either import-

export or a tonnage clause argument?
MR. BR10ER;

Welly we made in our brief a tonnage

clause argumentj and it is there.

I don’t really intend to

elaborate on that —
QUESTION:

Before if the tonnage clause prohibited

--hiss there would be nothing Congress could d© about it, is
that right?
MR. BRI3ER:

That is correct, that would be an

absolute test.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting then that the tonnage

clause Is a straw in the wind?

MR. BRIGER:

It is a possible argument which if one

looks at the impact of the tax and we find that the tax can
apply only because of the repeated events of importation and
exportation -- now we think there is an argument there that
the Court has said we will not look to the mere label on a
tax, we will look to its effect.

We would argue that even

though thl3 is a general property taxs it applies solely be­
cause of this transit situations and in that sense vre think
there is an argument that it could be considered a tonnage
duty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Brlger, may I get back to the ques­

tion my brother Blackman put to you before.

I think you told

us that in the California courts you argued the treaty of
friendship between the United States and Japan, but the United
States does not support you in that argument here, does it?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
Now, it does support you though in the

customs convention on the containers argument, but you never
raised that in the California courts.
MR. BRIGER:

No, that was not raised specifically in

the California courts.
QUESTION:

I think my brother Blackmun asked you

before then hoxf can you be heard on the customs convention
argument here.
MR. BRIGER:

Because it is a law of the country and

15
the fact that a treaty — the treaty Is a law of the country.
QUESTION:

But It is a treaty, as I recall It»

MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, It is a treaty»
But it deals only with import duties and

taxes and import prohibitions and that sort of thing, doesn’t
it?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Yes»
It doesn’t deal with the type of tax we

ere dealing with here.
MR» BRIGER:
QUESTION:
MR» BRIGER:

Conceivably it does.

I am not —-

Under what ~
Again, under thi3 concept that it

talks about duties for taxes of any type whatsoever by reason
of import, and we believe that there is an argument that can
be made that the tax applies only by virtue of the repeated
import and export of the containers, but we would — we look
to the treaty in •»QUESTION:

Well, If it 's an applicable treaty, I

take it that should end the case, shouldn't it, in your
favor?
MR» BRIGER:
QUESTION:
MR. BRIGER:

Yes, Justice Brennan»
If it is an applicable treaty»
If it is an applicable treaty.

We

find more support in the treaty as a general expression of
the federal government's Interest In promoting the usage of

16
containers.

We think there is an argument that the language

,!any taxes whatsoever by reason of export” can be extended to
the application of this tax in this case.

But we find more

solace from the treaty in expressing the views of the federal
government to expand and nurture the use of containers as a
*ew technological development in the shipment of cargo.
QUESTION:

It certainly would have been sensible

though if the convention addressed itself to containers and
new taxes.

I wonder, it would have been quite sensible to

deal with property taxes like that, wouldn’t lts instead of
the
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

This is the great —
— and then to reflect this international

custom.
MR. BRIGER:

Justice White, it is very difficult in

dealing in a codified world.

The drafters of tax statutes,

in their attempts to deal with each specific problem, It is
cne of the criticisms and that Is why the tax —
QUESTION:

Well, they certainly considered import

taxes because they use that expression in the convention.

But

was there any discussion at all In connection with the con­
vention of the type of tax we are talking about?
MR. BRIGER:

Your Honor, the reason why I believe

that there was not was that the perception at the time the
convention was entered into was that these were property

17
dealt with under the home port doctrine»
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. BRIGER:

That would be our best analysis of the

situation.
QUESTION:

When was this negotiated?

MR. BRIGER:

Well, the container convention which

began to be negotiated in the 1960fs as containers began to he
used at that time.

The 1962 convention was executed by cer­

tain of the signatory states in the 1960*s„

I believe the

United States became a party to the treaty in 1972.

But we

feel that the lack of any specificity in the container is due
to the general understanding at the time that the home port
doctrine eliminated this type of tax, and certainly California
in that period by following the SAS case certainly felt that
vay.

And It would appear that to the drafters of this type

treaty, that there was no need to put in this provision.

And

I believe the foreign and domestic airlines make certain
points to that effect in their brief, that this was the under­
standing.
QUESTION:

But you agree that the home port doctrine

has heretofore never been applied by this Court to anything
except domestic commerce, that it hasn’t been applied to
international commerce?
MR. BRIGER:
QUSTION:

Indeed.

And do other countries have a similar home

18
port doctrine to ours?
MR. BRIGER:

Yes.

For Instance, Japan — not only

did the trial court find that Japan applied the home port
doctrine, but we submitted to this Court a translation of the
property tax law of Japan.

Now, in that law owners of

personal property such as containers, a Japanese company is
required to register that property at the place of —- at its
principal place of business in Japan, and a tax of l.*5 percent
is imposed by Japan upon the value of the property as listed
in that register of assets.

So Japan certainly follows a

home port doctrine.
QUESTION:

Why would our negotiators be so confident

that the home port doctrine would cover property taxes when
this Court had never applied it to international trade?
MR0 BRIGER:

It seemed to be the practice, Your

Konor, and
QUESTION:

When you say ’’seemed to be the practice,"

what do you mean by that?
MR. BRIGER:

That for more than two-hundred years

states have not levied personal property taxes on things such
as airplanes.

In the one case where it was attempted in

California, we have the SAS case.
We feel that the Michelln case, in Michelin and
Washington Stevedores there was a coalescing of many of the
common principles, but they were clear to indicate that

19
property in transit, even if a tax was levied on a nondiscriminatory basis, would be considered to violate both the
import-export and the commerce clause, and I think that is
the exact situation that we are dealing with here.
QUESTION:

Are the containers here handled as the

containers were in Michelin?

As I recall in Michelin, they

arrived at wherever it was, the state, North Carolina, loaded
with tires and were unloaded and stored in a warehouse, some
cf them coming in from Nova Scotia, they simply took trailers
and attached tracters to them and shipped them from Nova
Scotia that way.

But overseas they took the wheels off in

France, was it —
MR. BRIGER:

In Michelin, these containers are not

containers with wheels, they are just boxes and they are
shipped in these vessels which are specifically designed to
handle —
QUESTION:

But once they get to California, how do

they get to the other states?
MR. BRIGER:

By rail or truck, Your Honor.

They

are carried flat —
QUESTION:
MR. BRIGER:

So they are not themselves trailers?
No, they are hold-on trailers.

But

just in response to another question that Judge Rehnquist had
raised, while the Court has never dealt with a situation
imposing property taxes upon foreign owned Instrumentalities,

20

it should be noted that none of the apportionment cases such
as Pullman’s Palace v. Pennsylvania, Ott v. Mississippi, or
Eraniff dealt with foreign owned instrumentalities.

The key

to our position is that neither this Court, the federal govern­
ment nor the states have the right to require foreign govern­
ments to accept the apportionment approach.

It might be

logical if they did, and it might well be something that could
be done through treaty.
QUESTION:

You say that Congress couldn’t by legis­

lation impose such a tax as this or authorize the states to
impose such a tax as this?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

I believe it could»
I thought a minute ago you said that not

even the federal government could authorize the Imposition of
this tax.
MR. BRIGER:

No, not the imposition of this tax, but

It could not require foreign governments to accept apportion­
ment as a means of the international taxation of these con­
tainers.

We don't have that right, You:'' Honor, the federal

government.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Secretary of the

Treasury has any regulatory power pursuant to the convention
on containers or pursuant to any other statute to effect this
tax?
MR. BRIGER:

Well —

21
QUESTION:

He has issued regulations to Implement

the United States duties under the container convention.,
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Do you think he could reach this question?

be reached only by the Court.

QUESTION:

What is the difference between a con­

MR. BRIGER:

I think that is perhaps a different

case because our containers are constantly in transit.
QUESTION:

I agree that it Is different, but there

wouldn’t be any difference in my case, would there?
MR. BRIGER:
QUESTION:

if the container —
If you have a warehouse that holds a

thousand tires and a container that holds a thousand tires,
and they both sit there for a year, the difference is what?
MR. BRIGER:

It would depend on the facts of the

case and in your illustration the container could be used as

23
a warehouse.

The containers that we are dealing with —

QUESTION:

And then you could tax it?

MR, BRIGER:
QUESTION:

If it were sedentary, I suppose —
If it were used as a warehouse, could

California tax it?
MR0 BRIGER:

If it were continually there, yes, I

would think that there are many distinctions.

I mean it Is

almost like when an item of personal property becomes fixed
to the real estate, it becomes real estate under the law.
And I suppose a container would be no different from any
ether piece of personalty that became affixed to the realty.
It would depend on the usage.

I think that is a different

case because in our case the average stay of the containers
were stipulated by the parties to be less than three weeks
per visit, and they were continually in motion.

I don't

disagree that if the container were affixed to the real estate
it could be a warehouse or a building or anything else.
QUESTION:

Well,

you think

the basis for

ruling in your favor is the danger of double taxation, Is
that it?

Is that really it?
MR. BRIGER:

It Is part of the danger.

merely a question of double taxation.

It isn't

foreign governments and it is very similar to what the Court

Number one, there are constitutionally viable

means of collecting the value of services, benefits or oppor­
tunities that can be imposed within the constraints of this
particular situation, namely to levy specific user charges;
cr, secondly, the states are not without the means to attempt
to influence the federal government to seek a new rule.
QUESTION:

But now you are talking about all con­

tainers, not just containers from Afghanistan.

What about

this property tax on containers from Afghanistan?
MR. BRIGER:

Well, we think because of the foreign

relations aspects of it, whether there is going to be retali­
atory taxes imposed is something better left to the State
Eepartment and not to be determined by any number of local
governments.

The question of retaliation or reciprocity Is

the manner In which this international carriage of goods and
cargo has been dealt itfith, so that if we are going to have
either reciprocal exemptions or retaliatory taxes with our
foreign trading partners, that clearly seems to be a matter
of exclusive federal concern.
Thank you.

Mr. Jones.

25
ORAL ARGUMENT OP KENT L. JONES, ESQ.,
PRO HAC VICE FOR THE UNITED STATES AS
AMICUS CURIAE
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Concern has been expressed so far on the question of
whether this Court has ever applied the home port doctrine in
the international context.

Of course, every time the Court

has distinguished a case, it has done so with the express
recognition that the rule may be different for International
transport, and In the first case it distinguished Hays,

the

Pullman’s Palace Car Company case, the Court expressly stated
that the rule with regard to Instruments for Intercommunica­
tion with other nations may require national treatment.
But at least since this Court’s decision in Hays,
and until the imposition of the tax by appellees In this case,
the consistent domestic practice of the United States has been
to exempt foreign owned and domiciled instruments of foreign
commerce from local property taxation.

Our domestic practice

in this regard is conformed to the international custom that
affords an Immunity from local property taxation to other
nations’ instruments of world commerce.
QUESTION:

Mr, Jones, what if this container had

been used not only to ship material from Japan to Long Beach
and inland from Long Beach, say, to Sacramento, but then a

26
separate trip had been made in the container shipping goods
from Sacramento down to the Imperial Valley a,nd then had gone
back to Long Beach?
MR. JONES;

As I understand your question, at least

part of that commerce was domestic commerce?
QUESTION;
MR. JONES:

Right.
Well, In that context the international

custom wouldn't apply because the international rule would not
purport to enter into the regulation of the domestic commerce
between points within the nation.
QUESTION:

So the container could —■ a pro rata tax

could be levied on the container based on the portion of the
time it spent making the journey from Sacramento to another
point in California carrying cargo?
MR. JONES:

If that journey were In domestic com­

merce as opposed to simply carrying Imported goods further
along or bringing exported goods out , that would not be in­
consistent with our understanding of the international practice.
QUESTION:
gests another answer,

Well, Mr. Jones, your Footnote lH sug­
’’Under Article 11 of the Customs

Convention on Containers...containers that are used 'even
occasionally' for domestic traff1c...may be taxed within"
MR. JONES:

Article 11 deals with the question of —

no, I think that Article 11 Is exactly consistent with what 1
said.

27
QUESTION:

Well, I would suggest maybe another

answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is it?
MR. JONES:

But our position with regard to the

Customs Convention on Containers is that by its terms it only
restricts the imposition of duties.

I Intend to discuss at

the close of my argument why we think it also has relevance
to —QUESTION:

Wells what does your Footnote 1*! mean?

It is yours, isn't it?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
And you say that the Customs Convention,

Article 11, says containers used even occasionally for
domestic traffic may be subjected to duties and taxes within
that nation.
4

MR. JONES:

Well, I don't see — I am having trouble

seeing —
QUESTION:

That is not another answer.

It is a

different ground for the same answer, isn't it?
MR. JONES:

Yes, I wouldn't argue with that.

The

immunity conferred by the international custom is not simply a
commercial favor granted by nations to foreign corporations.
Instead, it is based on a recognition of the special interests
that each nation possesses in the development and utilisation
of its instruments for world trade and is in this sense an
expression of deference and mutual accorunodatlon among

28
commercial nations.
The taxed imposed by appellees in this case and the
similar tax on foreign aircraft that the proposed has proposed
to assess is a direct departure from the accepted international practice.

The appellees claim that because the tax is an

apportioned tax, it does not unconstitutionally burden com­
merce.

But this argument we submit is made within a parochial

and unrealistic framework.
It is true that as recently as the Washington
Stevedoring case, this Court has stated that when a tax on
commerce within the United States Is apportioned among the
states, multiple burdens
not occur,"

on such commerce "logically can­

But the logic of that conclusion depends on the

fact that in cases Involving domestic or interstate commerce,
such as the Standard Oil and Braniff cases, this Court can
require the state of domicile as well as the non-domielllary
state to apportion the tax with the result that the property
in aggregate is subject to only one tax on its full value.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Jones, the government

makes neither a tonnage nor import-export clause argument,
does it?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That?s correct.
You rely exclusively on the commerce

clause argument?
MR, JONES:

Well, we rely exclusively on the commerce

29
clause»

We think the import-export clause argument could be

investigated but is wholly subsidiary to the commerce clause
argument.

If we lose on the commerce clause argument, we

would definitely lose on the import-export clause argument.
QUESTION:

But your Customs Convention argument

isn't an independent one, you don't
MR„ JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

It is an independent argument which —
But that isn't necessarily commerce.
No, I would say it is a supremacy clause

argument.
The logic of the domestic cases, however, have not
and cannot be realistically applied to foreign domiciled in­
struments of foreign commerce.

The international custom that

exempts these instruments from local property taxation also
recognizes, as this Court recognized in Hays, that the nation
of domicile may impose a full tax on the value of its instru­
ments of foreign trade.

The practical, logical consequence

of appellee's unilateral imposition of its tax in conflict
with the international practice is to inflict a multiple tax
burden on foreign domiciled instruments of commerce and
especially disadvantage this commerce because of its origin.
The burden cannot simply be removed by international
agreement, as the state court suggests.

Even assuming that a

rule of apportioned taxation is desirable in the International
context, such a rule cannot be dictated to the world by the

30
United States, much less by a single state»

The State Depart­

ment has noted that there is no realistic likelihood that
other nations will be willing to alter the international
practice merely to conform to the state's contrary rule.
Retaliation rather than accommodation appears the more likely
response to any unilateral domestic action.
Unless foreign commerce is to suffer, the tax treat­
ment of foreign domiciled instruments of foreign commerce
necessarily requires a uniform national rule that is based
either on the accepted International practice or results from
the reciprocal negotiations rather than international fiat.
QUESTION:

Well, would you say that is consistent

with the Bob-Lo case, what you just said?
MR» JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
That there have been either reciprocal

negotiations or uniform practice?
MR. JONES:

No, I would say that the Court’s conclu­

sion in that case was that there was no need for a uniform
national rule or in any event that the state’s rule didn't
conflict with any such need.
QUESTION:

But that isn’t quite what you said in the

sentence before that, is it, that it has to depend either on
uniform international practice or on negotiations reciprocal?
MR. JONES:

The uniform rule that we think is needed

in this case would have to come either from the accepted

31
International practice or a revision of that practice that
could only be obtained by reciprocal negotiations»
QUESTION:

But you say In some cases international

commerce does not "need” a uniform rule?
MR. JONES:

I would say that that Is correct»

The

state’s interjection of its single voice on a matter that has
previously been characterized by and we think requires inter­
national accommodation has occasioned substantial expressions
of concern by our major trading partners»

The principle of

mutual accommodation that underlies the home port rule and
the desire to avoid multiple burdens on foreign trade has
consistently been reflected in our foreign policy as in our
adoption of International conventions to provide temporary
free admission to this country of foreign containers and air­
craft employed in foreign commerce.
The state's independent action threatens the national
Interests in conducting foreign commercial relations on a
basis of international mutuality and reciprocity»

We submit

that the action of a single state cannot consistent with the
commerce clause be allowed to define the appropriate foreign
commercial policy for the entire union»
As we noted in our briefs we think there is an
additional reason that appellee’s tax is invalid based on the
rationale of the McGoldrick case.

In McGoldrick,, this Court

had before It the provisions of the customs laws that permit

32
imported articles to be admitted free of duty for manufacture
and re-exportation.

The Court held that the objectives of

this federal immunity was to provide a competitive advantage
to the trade and that that would be injured if the state were
allowed to impose its general sales tax on the merchandise,
thereby lessening the competitive advantage that Congress had
createdo
The Court concluded that the state tax was invalid
because in this practical operation it tended to frustrate
the federal objective.
In our brief, we note that the Customs Convention
on Containers provides similar treatment to foreign owned
containers in that the containers are to be admitted free of
duty for exclusive use in foreign commerce.
QUESTION:

Do you agree that this wasn't raised

before the Supreme Court of California?
MR. JONES:

My understanding of the record is that

the effecit of the — the possibility of the state tax was
/

Inconsistent with the Container Convention was raised„

Now,

the way in which the argument was framed below was different
than the wya it is framed here.

Below it was framed simply as

a question, as I understand it, of whether the state tax was

a prohibited duty.

Here it is raised on a different basis,

but it is our understanding that the Container Convention was
discussed by the court below1.

QUESTION:

But another treaty was presented, I

take it, and at least the treaty clause or the supremacy

MR. JONES:

Which was another supremacy clause argu­

ment .
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, would you think it would be suf­

ficient for the state court, for a party to rely-on the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and come up
here and say I abandon my equal protection clause argument, I
am now relying on the due process clause and say I talked
about the Fourteenth Amendment in the State Supreme Court?
MR. JONES:

Well, with the last caveat that you

added, I would say that, yes, he could raise it if he talked
about it in the State Supreme Court.

Is it in the briefs?
Oh, yes, sir.

wouldn’t you be more helpful if you could show it in the

MR. JONES:

As I recall the decision of the State

Supreme Court which, of course, incorporated the decision of
the appellate court, the Container Convention argument had
been rejected in the case the court previously considered,
the Sea-Land case, and It is my recollection =— which may be
incorrect, and I cannot find the source at this point -- that
there was reference made in the opinion in this Court to the

fact that the customs convention had been held to be inapplic­
able In its prior decision.

The issue has been presented to

the state court —
QUESTION:

So the point that you allege, you want

us to look it up?
MR. JONES:

1 don’t want you to look it up.

I knew inhere it were, but I regret that I do not.
time permits,

1 wish

I can If

I will attempt to find it.

The objective of the Container Convention is to
facilitate the use of the containers in world trade by avoiding

35
the Imposition of multiple burdens on the containers as they
move from nation to nation.

The tax imposed in this case

could under appellee’s theory be assessed also by other states
and other nations and thus create a multiple barrier to the
use of containers as instruments in world trade, a barrier
that would frustrate the object ve of the Container Conven­
tion.
I should note in one limited regard the regulations
implementing the Container Convention go beyond the conven­
tion’s subjstantive requirement that containers be exempted
from duties only while they are engaged exclusively in
foreign commerce.

Subsection (f) of the regulations allows

a narrow exception for domestic use of foreign containers if
the domestic traffic is only incidental to the foreign com­
merce and is along the container’s route in international
trade„
If any foreign containers travel under that excep­
tion, state taxation of the incidental domestic use would not
conflict with the objective of this convention which affords
an immunity only when the container moves exclusively in
foreign commerce.
QUESTION:

Where does the Secretary’s authority come

from to issue regulations?
MR» JONES:

We don’t think that the regulations

themselves here in this case control our analysis under the

\
36
McGoldrick theory, any more than the regulations were thought
relevant by the Court in McGoldrick.

We think that the sub­

stantive scheme is established by the treaty as it was estab­
lished by the statute in McGoldrick, so —
QUESTION:

So you rely only on the treaty and not on

the regulations?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That's correct0
But the regulatory authority arises under

a separate statute?
MR. JONES:

The regulatory authority — there is

regulatory authority to amplify the substantive scheme.

We

wouldn’t contend that an Incidental domestic use exception was
inconsistent with the Container Convention, but xve would say
that it is not supported by the Container Convention and that
it is only the objectives of the Container Convention to pro­
tect the use of these instruments as they are used exclusively
in foreign commerce, thus state taxation of the incidental
domestic use would not conflict with the Container Convention,
It Is only where the tax is applied, as In this case, to
containers that are involved exclusively in foreign commerce
that the tax Is in conflict with international practice and
also tends to frustrate the objectives of the Container Con­
vention.
Thank you.

37
ORAL ARGUMENT OP JAMES DEXTER CLARK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to get right down to the nature of the
home port doctrine, if I may.

The home port doctrine in

essence says that there will be no taxation of a movable
piece of property by a state which is visited unless actual
situs is acquired there.
In actual fact, the dispute between the appellants
and the appellees in this case does not involve the existence
or non-existence of a home port doctrine but only the exceptlon thereto, and that is whether or not there will be indeed
an exception created by continuous presence by means of
rotation or whether each piece of property must exist in the
taxing jurisdiction all year long.
real home port doctrine.

That is the nub of the

That is the nub of the dispute in

this case, and it Is also the nub of the enactment, that is,
the treaty dispute in this case.
I would like to proceed directly to the treaties
involving friendship, commerce and navigation, and specific­
ally that one Involving Japan.
QUESTION:

The first —»

Before you do that, just on the point

you just made about the home port doctrine, would it apply —
would there be any difference if this case involved the

38
taxation on the vessel itself rather than the container?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Quite frankly —>
The vessels were there, you know, ten or

fifteen days at a time.
MR. CLARK:

Quite frankly* Mr. Justice Stevens* it

would depend upon whether that presence was created there.

If

a vessel came Into the tax — I’m sorry., it depends upon two
things„ not only the presence* but It also depends upon the
benefits and protections conferred by the taxing jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Suppose they are precisely the same,

there Is the same amount of time in the port and exactly the
same protections?
MR. CLARK:

If those vessels came in and stayed

there for an average of three weeks and came in on a rotation
basis* as far as the Constitution Is concerned I believe
there Is no difference whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Well, that would be the same if the

average were three days, wouldn’t it?
MR. CLARK:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart,

if the continuous presence were there and ~
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

For an average of three days per annum.
Per individual ship.
Yes.
That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

That would be the case.

I think --

39
QUESTION:

And that was the case, wasn't it, in the

Hays case, that was a New York corporation with New York
shareholders, but their ships regularly went to San Francisco
and the opinion states — I don't have it in front of me —•
that the ships were in San Francisco regularly and spent
enough time in San Francisco to unload and get new stores
aboard and so ons and presumably they were there for an
average length of time, each ship, for each year.
MR. CLARK:

Judge Stewart, the problem in Hays, of

course, not only had it not considered the apportionment Idea
but in addition there was no continuous presence cited in
that case.

There was no year-long presence cited in that

case.
QUESTION:

But there wa3 in fact an average presence

per ship, obviously, wasn't there?
MR. CLARK:

That's correct, Your Honor, but the tax

was a full ad valorem tax, and the tax dealt with not an
apportioned tax but a tax on each ship as Its full value, and
that is I think the real distinction in terms of Hays'
factual situation and this one, that we do not pretend that we
can tax each container on a full ad valorem basis.

We contend

that we can tax the continuous presence of all of those con­
tainers In the taxing jurisdiction.

1 think that is a key

difference, between when Pullman's Palace Car went to that
difference, it said when It involved the situation of foreign

40
versus domestic carriers or international versus not internatlonal carriers, it was looking at a time I believe when there
were very fevr fleets of ships under one o^^^nership, and it was
looking at a single presence or a single item at a time, and
the opinion in Pullman's Palace Car said that, while those
instrumentalities in foreign commerce in no way maintain
themselves as a continuous presence in the taxing jurisdic­
tion.

That is totally different.

But at the same time, of

course, Pullman's did recognize the idea that instrumentali­
ties of foreign commerce as well as Instrumentalities of
interstate commerce may be taxed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Clark, did I understand you right

that in the good old days when the Queen Mary and the Queen
Elizabeth were coming over every week, that Cunard could be
taxed, because if so New York wouldn't have all of this
financial problem.
(Laughter)
MR. CLARK;
QUESTION:

Mr. Jusice Marshall, if that —
I don't understand how you can tax a

ship that comes back and forth and say you are not taxing
commerce ~
MR. CLARK;
QUESTION;
MR. CLARK;

Mr. Justice Marshall ~
— a ship that is in commerce.
— the logical extension of that is if

you say that the railroad cars in Pullman's Palace Car may be

taxed3 then 1 believe if the? benefits and protections are
there, you are not taxing commerce as such, you are recouping
the return on the benefits and protections conferred and the
burdens on the local government.

The distinction — yes, Mr.

Justice Marshall?
QUESTION:
ship?

Well, what benefits do you give to a

Doesn’t a ship have its own firefighting equipment?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

It may have, and .it may have a
They may have?

Aren’t they required to

have It in order to come into port?
MR. CLARK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is true,,

too, and also ports have their own firefighting equipment, as
the appellants pointed out, as far as Long Beach is concerned.
Whether or not the fee imposed by the court would negate the
idea of a benefits and protections test as applied to a vessel,
I don’t know because I have not looked into the question of a
local jurisdiction’s benefits and protections as applied to a
vessel.

I do know that if the benefits and protections are

there, that I believe that it is the local government’s right
to recoup that particular buden on them.
I admit that the containers I think are quite dis~
tinguishable from vessels in that they more clearly supply
those burdens on local government.

They go through our roads,

they stay here for at least for an average of three weeks, they
entail police and fire protection by the municipalities as

well as the county throughout their stay.
QUESTION:

Any more than the truck Itself that bears

them?
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice,, that is in all prob­

ability, no, as long as that truck has the same kind of ex­
istence in the taxing jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

The carrier, the container here doesn’t

wear the highway out any more than the truck would if they
had taken everything out of the container and piled it on the
truck.
MR. CLARK:

Yes, it would, Your Honor.

Quite

frankly, it would, with the added weight.
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

QUESTION:

No.
There would be a substantial difference

Does the record show what the added weight

is?
MR. CLARK:

Mo, It does not, Your Honor.

But, Mr.

Chief Justice, when we arrived at the particular point in
question, 1 think we have all of those benefits and protec­
tions which we have logically cited in our brief, and it is
the appellant’s burden to dispute that and to reject the
fact that the services to which the tax is put does not apply
to them, and I think that we have logically shown that they do
apply to them, that fire and police protection apply to them,

43
fchat the flood control applies to them, that all of the other
services which aid the appellants in coning into our taxing
jurisdiction as an enterprise and earning profit should be
recouped by the local government.
Once you get beyond that point, we look into the
treaty itself to determine whether or not the federal govern­
ment has indeed enacted a particular point in order to dis­
turb that relationship, I think it is w5.se to look at the
friendship9 commerce and navigation treaties.

And the start

of that inquiry, of course, is Article 22, paragraph

where

national treatment is defined differently for the states and
territories than it is for the United States itself, and by
treaty national treatment does not say no less than treatment
you will give to other people.

It says that national treat­

ment equals the same treatment you give enterprises from other
statess and relating that national treatment to the articles
which are key in this particular case we run up against the
Import-export provision in Ai’ticle 14, paragraph 5, which says
you will give national treatment In all respects to importexport; In Article 19, paragraph 3, you will give national
treatment and equal treatment to vessels coming into your
territory; and in Article 16, paragraph 1, you will give
national treatment with regard to internal taxes.
I believe that the friendship, commerce, and naviga­
tion treaties thereby show that the states — that the federal

government, even If we admit the federal power to exist to
exempt from state taxation without taking the responsibility
for the services provided, even if we say that that power
exists in the federal government, we have a problem with re­
gard to the PCN treaties.

And one would believe that in light

of the apportionment statements in the 3?CN treaties, in light
of the particular statements with regard to import-export and
vessels and internal taxes, that some demonstrable showing
with regard to the Container Convention would be present if
the Container Convention is cited as apparently overruling the
FCN treaties, that some positive showing — and as a matter
of fact, the Secretary’s authority under 19 U.S.C. 1322(a)
shed even additional light beyond that, and that is that the
Secretary has the authority with regard to all instrumentalties of commerce which come from foreign countries to say that
they will be exempt from the ordinary customs laws.
Now, if we say that this non-discriminatory uniform
property tax is indeed a customs lav;, then I think we have
said that practically every general tax in the country is a
customs law.
whatsoever.

I find no allusion to property taxes in 19 U.S.C.
I find no allusion to property taxes in the

Customs Convention or the Container Convention, which I be­
lieve ought to be present if we are going to have such an
impact which was acknowledged in the FCN treaties to be the
other way»

We would have something explicit in the Container

*15

Convention.

And to simply say that property is taxed by reason

of importation simply because it comes into the taxing juris­
diction is to say that every tax on every piece of foreign
property is immune»
Now, the idea is that in essence what the appellants
are really — the logic of the appellant's position is that
because there is a danger of multiple taxation, we should not
tax this property which has exactly the same kind of benefits
and burden relationship as any other property continuously
existing in the taxing jurisdiction.

That is not so to be

wrong by the appellants of the United States or anyone.
The United States relies on a custom of international
law, and they prove half of it.

They say that some countries

do not tax our property going into their jurisdiction, but
they do not prove the other half.

They do not say that they

have personal property tax structure in their country and
therefore they have made some kind of exception.

They do not

say that they do not recoup these matters by other kinds of
fees or taxes.
They simply say that when it gets down to personal
property taxes, most other countries don't impose them and
then they cite a few exceptions, and that is the thirty-day
rule, the ninety-day rule in Afghanistan.

One would believe

therefore that since we have a thirty-day rule on the customs
laws of other countries, that therefore California could tax

if the containers were here for over thirty days.
Now, we do have a questionmark on the factual stipu­
lation, the average is three weeks and no less than six months.
It is quite possible that many of those containers are over
here for over thirty days.

We don’t know.

But the very idea

is that if they are, then California would be going along
reciprocally with those nations who Impose a thirty-day rule»
QUESTION:

Tell me, Mr. Clark, if you prevail, could

Congress constitutionally prohibit this tax?
MR» CLARK:

Mr. Justice Brennan, it is not simply

the power to prohibit that the United States or the Solicitor
General seeks.
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

No, no.

My question Is if you prevail.

Yes, sir.
If you prevail.
Right.
Could Congress nevertheless prohibit the

county from imposing this tax?
MR. CLARK:

Right, Mr. Justice Brennan.

I believe

It goes two ways.
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

I see,
I think that Congress can prohibit per­

haps this particular levy in the national interest if It also
does not take -- if it also takes responsibility for the
benefits and protections conferred.

What the —

QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

How does it do that?
Well, the Solicitor General is urging

this Court to adopt a position that would say in essence that
Congress can exempt a piece of property from

state taxation

whereas at the same time it leaves the state holding the bag
for providing the benefits and protections to that particular
piece of property.

Now, if it does that in the name of

reciprocity, it is in essence saying, well, gee, this business­
man In Virginia needs some help and he is operating in Japan,
therefore we are going to confer a benefit on a Japanese
company operating in California.
QUESTION:

But isn’t the state of California per­

fectly free if the judgment of the Supreme Court of California
is reversed here to say to hell with these containers, we are
not going to provide any protection to them because they don't
contribute, we are not allowed to exact a share of their tax
burden?
MR. CLARK:

That may be true, Mr. Justice Brennan,

because I have a rough time saying that a state that provides
general benefits and protections can suddenly say that for —
QUESTION:

If you don't tax that container, you are

going to lose the house that that container is next to.
MR. CLARK:
Marshall.

I think that is true, Mr. Justice

We have both sides of that question, that I believe

-— I do not know that a state could simply say for one specific

person we are not going to protection you because you don’t
pay.

On the other hand, I think that there would be a danger

physically of saying that for foreign cargo containers we are
not going to protect them, when in actual fact if a fire breaks
out it imperils other structures» And, of course, there are the
other indirect public health burdens which we simply have to
provide in order to keep our population at work.
I think that what the Solicitor General is in essence
saying, Mr. Justice Brennan, is the idea that they don’t have
to do that, that they can benefit the man in Virginia ulti­
mately by this reciprocal thing without underwriting the
California expense and leave the California taxpayers holding
the bag.
QUESTION:

What Article I power would that be9 the

power over international commerce?
MR. CLARK:

I believe that It would either he the

commerce clause power over commerce or perhaps the treaty
power.

I quite frankly have ~
QUESTION:

Well, the President of the United States

negotiates treaties and then only one house of Congress gets
Involved in those and that is the Senate.

My brother Brennan’s

question to you had to do with what Congress could do, not
what the President and two-fchlrds of the Senate could do.
MR. CLARK:

Well, I hope that I have answered the

question with regard to Congress.

I believe that under Its

49
power to regulate foreign commerce, regulation and taxation
for benefits and protections ~
QUESTION:

Why couldn’t Congress under that explicit­

ly conferred power totally exempt these things from taxation,
local, state or national, and why wouldn't that be preemptive
of any county or state?
MR. CLARK:

Number one, regulation and taxation are

two entirely different things»

Mr. Justice Stewart, we exist,

or I hope we exist in a federal system.

It involves that the

people who are local to that jurisdiction, I myself can go to
my city council and say I would like to ask a question about
fire protection.

Now, if the United States of Congress — or

I would like to ask a question about my property tax, why am
I paying more than somebody else.

If the city council tells

me that the United States Congress has said that that guy Is
going to be exempted and you have to pay his till, that I
think Is right at the heart of the federal system.

If we

have a
QUESTION:

We must all concede that; of course we

have a federal system, but we must all concede further that
the framers chose to confer a great deal of power upon the
Congress of the United States in the area of Interstate and
international commerce.
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

That is correct, isn’t it?

That Is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
And if Congress would — if these things

50
are — if these instrumentalities, as they have been called,
are in international commerce, then why wouldn’t Congress have
complete power to exempt them from taxation?
MR. CLARK:

Because the regulation of commerce is

different from the taxation of the property within the taxing
jurisdiction.

The regulation of commerce deals with gearing

up toward giving somebody a benefit and not giving other
people a benefit; the taxation of commerce was treated
separately in the Constitution, and Gibbons v. Ogden recognises
the difference between taxation and regulation, and we exist
in terms of the states, as narrow as their ambit has become.
We exist in terms of a uniform nondiscriminatory tax levied in
return for benefits and protections conferred and —
QUESTION:

Did I misunderstand your answer to my

brother Bennan’s question?

I thought you said, yes. Congress

could do it?
MR. CLARK:

I’m sorry, Mr. Justice Stewart, my

feeling is that If they can, if they can do it, then they must
take the responsibility as

well as the benefits.

In other

words, if the commerce clause says that pursuant to regulation
you can disturb that relationship and take off a tax, you have
to take the benefits and protections along with it, otherwise
what you have -QUESTION:
nov/?

What protections are you talking about

Do you mean the federal government has got to come in

51
and furnish police excort and fire departments on the road
and —
MR0 CLARK;

I’m sorry* Mr, Chief Justice.

The very

idea of a tax cn a piece of property being imposed, my vision
would be perhaps that if the federal government decided that
all foreign goods would remain immune from state taxation,
that in order to proceed in the national Interest with national
resources* as was done in Missouri v. Holland, they didn’t use
state troopers to go out and protect the birds, they use
federal officers and it became a federal law that if they
use those national resources in the national interest* they
have to take both the benefits and protections along with the
-y

benefit of —
QUESTION:

Well* you mean* Mr. Clark, that the

federal government, if It were to exempt these containers*
would have to at least provide the county with the same amount
that It loses in taxes in order to help support the police and
fire?
MR. CLARK;

I believe, Mr. Justice Brennan, if there

is anything to be said about that particular point, if we go
so far as to say that the federal government can make a nondisc r iminatory tax

into a federal regulation, then I believe

they have to take the bvirdens with the benefits.
QUESTION;
MR. CLARK;

Then your answer to my question is yes?
Yes, sir, It is.

QUESTION:

What itfould we do, issue mandamus against

Congress?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice Marshall —
Well, how would you get this equipment out

there that the federal government has to, how would you get it?
QUESTION:

Oh, I’m sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall.

I

believe that the idea — If, for instance, customs had sealed
off an area, had bought a federal enclave, as they do In
federal enclaves, Mr. Justice Marshall, as —

MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Well, this Is no federal enclave,,
No, It is not, Mr. Justice Marshall.
We are talking about Long Beach.
That's right.
Do you want Congress to take over Long

Beach?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

No, Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not.
I didn’t think you did.
The very idea though, I think that what

I believe Is that —
QUESTION:

I don't know what you're talking about

when you sajr that the federal government has to give fire pro­
tection to Japanese containers in Long Beach.
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Justice Marshall —
Is that what you said?
What I am saying is this, sir —

53
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Is that what you said?
I think I said if the federal government

-- it is logical to do that if the federal government claims
the privilege of immunising a piece of property from tax ’which
is the recoupment for those benefits and protections.
QUESTION:

Well* can’t we rule against you without

all of that?
MR. CLARK:

You have to reach, I believe, Mr.

Justice —

MR. CLARK:

Can’t we —

You have to at least say that Congress can —

MR. CLARK:

We have to?
If you rely on the enactments of the

treaties —

MR. CLARK:

How do we have to, because you say so?
No, sir.

No, sir.

Of course not.

What

I —
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

I’ve got news for you.
I’m sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall, I did

not mean to in any way say that the Court has to -QUESTION:

Well, you said Congress had to.

You said

Congress, if Congress enforced the Constitution and said that
Long Beach cannot enforce this tax, that Congress would have
to give the police, fire and other protection.

Isn’t that

what you said?
MR. CLARK:

Logically, under the federal system, yes

sir.
QUESTION:

That is what you said.

MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Let's assume that fjomeone in New Jersey

starts a steam boat line running up -- or a diesel that would
be today, I suppose, a diesel running up the Hudson River and
they obviously make stops at Hudson River ports.

Can New York

tax the diesel barges and vessels going from New Jersey up
the Hudson?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

I think only «—
Let’s say they have exactly what we’ve

got here, containers.
MR, CLARK:

If they have a continuous presence in

the taxing Jurisdiction, and I think that those benefits and
protections are there, then the tax I think automatically
follows.
QUESTION:

Now, Gibbons v. Ogden didn't involve a

tax, it involved the licensing —
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

No, it did not.
— but do you suggest that New York could

tax New Jersey’s diesel barges going up the Hudson?
MR. CLARK:
Car says, Mr. Justice.

That is certainly what Pullman’s Palace
The other side though, too, Is that

55
the regulation ~ that is what Gibbons v.. Ogden I think is all
about.

It says first of all they cannot regulate, you cannot

prohibit that man from going up that river, but that you can
tax him.

You can go out there and get a return for the

benefits and protections conferred, and I think that is true
as long as the continuous presence and those benefits and pro­
tections are there.
I believe in this case the continous presence and
the fact situation that we have here fully support — and the
appellants have not refuted itthat the benefits and pro­
tections are there.
QUESTION:

Mr. Clar, suppose the President were to

negotiate a treaty with Japan, ratified by the Senate and
Congress were to pass implementing legislation under the
interstate commerce power 3aying exactly what the treaty said,
that no property imported from Japan should ever be subjected
to any state property tax so long as it was in evidence, no
matter how long it had been in this country.

Do you think

that would be constitutional for Congress to do?
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I have gotten

Into trouble with the Court on this.

I do not believe that

that would be proper under the federal system.
QUESTION:

I think

When you say "proper,” do you think It

would be constitutional for Congress to do that?
MR. CLARK:

No, sir, I wouildn’t.

I think there are

56
limitations on congressional authority, and what I was getting
to, if I may emphasize this once again, is that the logical of
the federal system requires that if the federal government
take the tax power away from the states,, they must also have a
responsibility for those benefits and protections which the
state confers in one way or another.

Now, that is the logic

to me of the federal system and the relationship between those
benefits and protections that you have.
QUESTION:

Are you making that as an economic argu­

ment, advancing it that way, or as a constitutional argument*
that there is a constitutional obligation to provide a sub­
stitute for the tax revenue?
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, 1 think the constitu­

tional argument is that there is no power in Congress to do
that in the first place»
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Well* you said —
I speak economically In the other terms

of —
QUESTION:

You said they could do it if they made

the substitute provision»
MR. CLARK:

I’m sorry, Your Honor»

I meant to say

if they could do it, I believe that that would follow, and I
believe that is an economic argument following I think the
federal relationship between the state and the federal govern­
ment.

57
QUESTION:

I just want to be sure that what you are

suggesting here about the quid pro quo, this is your idea,
there are no cases that suggest this?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

No, sir, there are not.
I am just wondering why you make the

argument so strenuously.

It seems to me you would be

tactically much better off to say, yes, Congress has all the
power in the world but hasn't exercised it.
MR. CLARK:

Well, I think that quite frankly tactic­

ally — I’m sorry, it is true, the enactment is not there.
Mr. Justice Stevens, perhaps that is a luxury of those of us
in public law have to strenuously urge those things which we
feel are right and sound, and perhaps that is where I am.

But

I believe that both arguments are quite correct.
I am concerned, Mr. Justice Stevens, if the federal
government has that power as to what is going to happen in
terms of our federal system, in terms of state-federal rela­
tionships.

I honestly believe that the states have a purpose,

and I say it has been constricted by probably correct interpretatiens of the commerce clause.
QUESTION:

Of course, what might happen is that you

won’t be able to tax things you haven’t been able to tax for
the last couple of hundred years.
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Justice Stevens, the idea of course

is that they have not been here for a couple of hundred years.

58
California has exercised I guess —
QUESTION:
going.

No, but the vessels have been coming and

I think you started earlier in saying these are just

like vessels;, and I don’t think you’ve tried to tax vessels for
a couple hundred years.
MR. CLARK:

Well, under California law we cannot.

The 3tate constitutional provision which the appellants
alluded to has been interpreted as not corresponding with the
equal protection standards and therefore the exemption was ap­
plied by the Court to all vessels.
QUESTION:

Mr. Clark, may I ask you an easier

question.
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice Powell.
If we should affirm the decision of the

California court, could the county tax aircraft owned by
foreign lines and based in foreign countries but that use
your airport?
MR. CLARK:

If the continuous presence is there —

actually, on the scheduled airlines, I think that Ott v.
Mississippi Barge Line -would go along with their regular
presence

as well as continuous
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

I would say yes.

The aircraft also use containers.
They have their own interior containers

which, however, are not used in the same way as these con­
tainers.

They are simply taken off the airplane, perhaps

59
taken to the warehouse, often unloaded directly at the air­
port and kept xvlth the airplane itself.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Clark, you say they could not

only tax the containers but the aircraft themselves, wouldn’t
you say?
MR. CLARK:

Oh, yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, I thought

that was the question, whether we could tax the aircraft, and
I think that is correct.
QUESTION:

Is it possible to distinguish the air­

craft from the taxation on the containers here so that we
could affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of California
and yet nonetheless not foreclose the question of the tax­
ability of the aircraft?
MR. CLARK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think so.

#

The aircraft — I hate to use this touching language, but the
aircraft do come in to only one place In the taxing jurisdic­
tion, and that place is covered — well, like the New York
Airport Authority, Los Angeles has the same sort of thing,
and is covered by airport fees.

When the container comes In

here, the fee in the port Is imposed on the vessel, whether
it has containers or not.

When the containers come here, they

proceed in and through and to destinations and from destina­
tions throughout the taxing jurisdiction, and that gives you
the assurance I believe that the benefits and protections and
the tax relationship is there; whereas, with the airplane,

\

60
perhaps that benefit and tax relationship is a little bit more
conjectural simply because -QUESTION:

But, Mr. Clark, if you are right and you

could tax the aircraft, I take it if Japan Air Lines has a
scheduled stop at Los Angeles ~
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— and another scheduled stop at Chicago

and another scheduled stop at New York, at Idlewild, that
Illinois and New York could also tax the aircraft.,
MR. CLARK:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Brennan»

they could Indeed but only in the sense of its apportioned
presence.
QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

Only what?
Only in keeping with its apportioned

presence.
QUESTION:

Could you also tax the trains that stop

at each place?
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Justice Marshall, we do.

QUESTION:

You could?

MR. CLARK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:
MR. CLARK:

What happened In the Pullman case?
The Pullman ease has been followed by

every state imposing personal property tax ever since its
inception, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

You put the planes and the trains on the

61
same level?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Sir, 1 think that different —
Aren't you taking a whole lot of weight?

You are only talking about a — this case only involves con­
tainers .
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
everything else»

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.
And you carry this out on ships and

How far are you going on this?

MR. CLARK:

Mr. Justice Marshall,, I think that there

QUESTION:

Won’t you be satisfied with just the con­

are —

tainer point being decided?
MR. CLARK:

I believe that it can be decided that

way, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is correct.

And I don't mean

to assert or push anybody, Mr. Justice Marshall.

What I am

saying in essence is that the apportionment doctrine logically
applies to the benefits and protections conferred to all of
these instrumentalities if, as I say, the port authority and
these other things follow.
QUESTION:

So you won’t be satisfied if we just stop

on containers?
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:
broad argument.

Oh, no, sir, I will be satisfied.
Well, it wasn’t your idea to make this

You are simply trying to answer the questions

from members of the Court.

62
MR. CLARK:

That Is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart,

and I —>
QUESTION:

He started it.

(Laughter)
MR. CLARK:

The whole port doctrine then deals with

the exception to it, and the argument with the home port
doctrine deals with that exception by means of apportionment.
The friendship, commerce and navigation treaty stands I
believe soundly for the proposition that both national treat­
ment and apportionment are the expectations which the
appellants receive when they come here.
There are many treaties involving prevention of
double taxation with regard to federal income taxes and the
like, and the friendship, commerce, and navigation treaties I
believe were intended to fill a general rule as to all other
taxes, including state and local taves, which are specifically
mentioned therein, and which in essence show that the national
treatment and the very idea of apportionment were encountered
by the people involved In negotiating that treaty and accepted
both.

So that I think the enactment of the executive and of

the federal government indicate that this tax is proper.

The

Container Convention contains no. specific language and, as I
say, if we contend that the taxation by reason of Importation
means that this tax is covered by that language,■then all
taxes are covered by that language.
