ORAL ARGUMWNT OF WILLIAM M, LEECH* JR. * ESQ „ *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRo LEECH:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may It please

the Court:
This case had its origin or Its genesis in late
October of 1972* when the Respondents in this case were arrested
for murder in Shelby County for a homocide committed in Tipton
County* Tennessee.

They were Indicted in November of/1972

before the Grand Jury of Tipton County* which was chaired by
an acting foreman who had been appointed by the trial judge
under Tennessee's system of appointing the foreman of the grand
jury.
The acting foreman was accompanied on the grand
jury by twelve other grand jurors selected from the general
venire of Tipton County.
to that indictment.

There was a per se plea In abatement

A hearing was held in the trial court*

and evidence was taken.

The trial* judge overruled the plea.

It went on to trial* and a conviction was had against both
Respondents and each was sentenced to 60 years.
The Respondents then perfected their appeal to the

4
Intermediate Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Court of
Criminal Appeals considered the same assignments of error in
the original plea which attacked the method of selecting the
foreman of the grand jury, in that the plea originally alleged
systematic exclusion in the appointment of the acting foreman
of the grand jury by the trial judge.
The Court of Appeals ruled favorably for the state
and against the plea.
Supreme Court.

It then was appealed to the Tennessee

Certiorari was denied, and in the per curiam

opinion the court found that the case had been adequately dealt
with by the Court of Criminal Appeals.
Thereafter, in 1975, petitions were filed by
Respondents in the District Court at Memphis for petitions of
habeas corpus, writ of habeas corpus.

Thereafter, reference

to the magistrate was had by Judge Bailey Brown on the bench,
and the magistrate did take proof, the trial record was filed
and affidavits were submitted.
Subsequently, the case was dismissed by the District
Court, in that the District Court found that the foreman of
the grand jury had been selected for other reasons than racial.

v,

\

:

::

In essence, the proofNb^fore the court at that time was to the
effect that the trial judge had selected the acting foreman of
the grand jury because of his prior experience and the satis­
factory manner in which he had performed that duty,
Petition to rehear was filed before the District Court,

5
which was further considered and overruled and then the appeal,
of course* was taken to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and
the action of the Federal District Court at Memphis was re­
versed and the Sixth Circuit did find that there was a syste­
matic exclusion in selection of the foreman of the grand jury.
Our arguments and contentions on behalf of the State
of Tennessee* basically* are* number one* that Judge Brown's
finding was correct* in that the foreman was selected for
reasons other than racial* and that the foreman had been selec­
ted* acting foreman* to fill the vacancy of the normal foreman
who was unavailable during that term of court* and the affida­
vits of the trial judge and the foreman of that grand jury both
indicated that it was for prior experience and satisfactory
work vjell done.
Further* at that time* it should be noted that the
foreman of the grand jury did not vote in the indictment.

The

voting of the indictment was by twelve grand jurors who were
selected from the general venire list.
Further* the record indicates that the race of the
defendants* Respondents here* was unknoxm to them at that time*
and that there was no mention or there was no alluding to the
race of the Respondent defendants.
QUESTION:

Does the grand jury vote have to be

unanimous in Tennessee?
MR. LEECH:

No* sir* it requires that twelve grand

6
jurors Indict.
QUESTION:

In other words, it takes a vote of twelve?

MR. LEECH:

Yes, sir, and the foreman is, under

Tennessee law, the thirteenth grand juror and may vote.
QUESTION:

Under Tennessee law, before a person can

be tried for this kind of an offense, must he be indicted by
a grand jury or can there be an information?
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:
as to size?

Must be by grand jury. Your Honor.
Are the grand juries statutorily regulated

Are they all theoretically thirteen?

MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Kehnquist.
Mr. Attorney General, I may have missed

your stating it, but does the record show the race of the
victims in this murder case?
MR. LEECH:

Yes, sir, the record does show that the

race of the victims was also black, as was the race of the
Respondent Defendants.
QUESTION:

Do you challenge, incidentally, the

conclusions of the court below that Respondents made out a
prima facie case?
MR. LEECH:

No, sir, Your Honor.

The court below

did hold that a prima facie case was made out by the statement
of the prior grand jury foremen, some three to four in number,
who said to their recollection there had never been a black
foreman of the grand jury in Tipton County.

7
I think that did make a -- We did not contest that,
no, sir.
QUESTION:
the history there?

How about the judges of that court, what's
Any Negroes ever been judges of that court?

Is that in the record?
MRo LEECH:

Mr. Chief Justice, it is not in the

record, and I have no personal recollection.
QUESTION:

You have no personal recollection either

way?
MR0 LEECH:

No, sir, either way.

that familiar with Tipton County.

I, frankly, am not

It is in upper West Tennessee,

across the Mississippi River from the Missouri line.

It is

probably closer to St. Louis than it is to Nashville or Memphis.
I would also add that one witness testified before
this grand jury panel.

That witness was the arresting officer*

After that a vote was taken, although there were some other
twenty witnesses subpoenaed before the grand jury at that term.
At the trial, there were some five eyewitnesses, as
to both defendants.
We contend that the trial court was correct in finding
that it was based on pragmatic reasons and was neutral to the
race Issue.
The second argument that we put forth is that even
assuming that error existed and that there was systematic exclu­
sion in the selection of the foreman of the grand jury, that it

8
would be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt# when the
record is viewed on the whole# with the evidence of guilt being
overwhelming at trial# free of reversible constitutional error
and free of any constitutional error as to the petit jury make­
up or to the grand jury makeup# who were selected from the
general venire list.
The third argument and position which the state puts
forth is that the federal habeas corpus should be limited when
we have an issue involving the selection of the foreman of a
grand jury# who is one of thirteen# with twelve voting members#
and an opportunity has been had for a full and fair litigation
in the state system which Tennessee has -- a three-tiered court
system from the actual trial before a jury of a criminal offense#
and further an extensive Post-conviction relief act.

Further#

that if the trial is free from constitutional reversible error
and no assignments are made to the petit juryj in essence# an
extension of the Stone v. Powell case.
We say this knowing that this is the first time# to
my knowledge# that squarely there has been any extension of the
rationale in Meal in 1881 to extend to the foreman selection
of a grand jury.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record as to what

the foreman does?
MR» LEECH:
QUESTION:

I am sorry?
Is there anything in the record# or any

9
place else*» that tells you what the foreman does?
MRo LEECH:

Yes, sir* The statutory description of

the foreman's duty is in the record.
QUESTION:

MRo LEECH:

Is there anything beyond the statute?
Yes, sir.

The foreman of the grand jury

did submit an affidavit before the Federal Magistrate at the
District Court level/, in which he stated in this case that he
did not vote/ and that he did preside.
We contend that the foreman's chore is basically
ministerial and administrative, in that it assists in the
organizing of the grand jury scheduling of witnesses.
He stated that since he had been serving as foreman
of the grand jury/ which had been many years — under Tennessee's
system, they are usually reappointed, as was stated by the trial
judge -- he had never voted except in one case.
QUESTION:
what does he do?

I mean

Does he just sit there?

MR* LEECH:
appear.

I am not interested in his voting.

He schedules the witnesses who are to

He asks them questions and then he turns to the other

members of the grand jury and asks them if they have any ques­
tions of the witness.
QUESTION:
MR» LEECH:
QUESTION:
MRo LEECH:

So he does have something to do?
Yes, sir.
He is sort of the chairman?
Yes, sir.

He is the chairman of the grand

jury.
QUESTION:
want?

Can Juror A call a witness that he doesn't

Does he determine who testifies and who does not?
MR» LEECH:
QUESTION:
MR» LEjECH:

Mo# sir»

Under Tennessee law ~~

You said he calls the witnesses.
He schedules them# I would suppose# or

does the ministerial function of calling them.
QUESTION:

I mean# if the foreman of the grand jury

decides who will testify and who will not testify# then that's
just not a perfunctory position.
MR» LEECH:

Mr. Justice Marshall# he does make

he

is not the sole arbiter of who testifies.

Any grand juror can

insist on or ask to hear from a witness.

As a practical matter#

I think most district attorneys general who have charge of the
grand jury schedule and report on the indictment form who the
witnesses are as a result of the investigation from the law
enforcement officer»

The foreman does work closely with the

district attorney general when the grand jury is not in session.
In many of Tennessee's counties# the grand juries are not in
continuous session.

Of course, in metropolitan areas# such as

Nashville and Memphis and Chattanooga# they are in continuous
session and there are usually two grand juries operating con­
tinuously»
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General# you say there hasn't

been any extension of Neal to foremen# but wouldn't your position

11

on the Stone v, Powell Issue be the same with respect to
challenging the composition of the entire grand jury?
MR® LEECH:

Yes* sir»

On the grand jury# we would,

under the rationale encompassed in Stone, in that Tennessee
has a full and fair ferial and appellate practice and —
QUESTION:

That issue on the grand jury just wouldn't

be open in federal collateral relief?
MR. LEECH:

Under habeas corpus, there is a collateral

attack, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

So, your position does encompass that.

So I take it you are saying that even if Stone v. Powell would
pick up challenges to the grand jury in general, It shouldn't
pick up challenges to the foreman; is that it?
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:
MRo LEECH:

Yes, sir.
Or should they both be treated the same?
I would say, of course, there Is a line

at some point •=■=* there is a breaking point.
haven't gone to the arresting officer.

Obviously, we

We haven't gone to the

committing magistrate, in the manner In which that individual
is selected.

There must be a breaking point.

Our position is that that breaking point should be
after the petit jury for that relief.
I am candid to say that if the matter was brought
before the Tennessee Appellate Court and systematic exclusion
was shown, systematic exclusions of blacks to serve as grand

12

jurors* It should* I maintain* be reversed by the Court,

But

If a collateral attack —
QUESTION:

Yes* but habeas corpus has been available

on grand jury for a long time* hasn't it?
MR, LEECH:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir,
Well* I had understood your position to be*

with respect to singling out the foreman of the grand jury* that
not necessarily just under federal habeas* but as a matter of
federal constitutional law* in this particular case* where the
foreman doesn't vote* the general rule applying in the pre­
sumption of prima facie case to grand jury shouldn't apply
just because of this particular foreman,
MR. LEECH:

In this particular case* yes* sir.

QUESTION:

I understand your position to be that* too.

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General* just so I'll be sure

I understand your position

I understood it to be that quite

without regard to the foreman — Let's assume that you didn't
have any foreman.

You had a twelve-man grand jury that indicted

the defendant* and thereafter the defendant was tried before a
petit juicy* the composition of which was not questioned* and the
defendant was found guilty.

And then the case wands its way

fitirough direct review* and ends up in federal habeas corpus,
I understand your position to be that federal habeas
corpus does not apply to that type situation* that it cannot
be invoked to review the question of whether or not the grand

13

jury was properly composed.
Is that your position?
MR* LEECH:
QUESTION:
the foreman.

Yes, sir*
Well, I wonder why you talk so much about

I take it that’s an alternative position.

MR* LEECH:

Yes.

We just simply say that since it

has never been extended to the foreman, it has been extended,
as has been pointed out, to grand jury composition.
QUESTION:

But in how many cases was it extended to

the grand jury in habeas corpus, where the composition of the
petit jury also had not been attacked?
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:
those cases?

A number, I think.
Well, how many?
I really don't know the number.
Was this question ever raised in any of

Perhaps it was.

I don't know.

I am asking for

Information.
MR. LEECH:

I really don't know the numerical break-

d own.
QUESTION:

But your point, I take it, is that what­

ever may be the law, with respect to the membership -- the
voting members of the grand jury -- that has no bearing on the
selection of the foreman?
MR. LEECH:
correct.

Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

We are saying first that federal habeas corpus should

14

not be the writ available for a collateral attack on the grand
jury composition itself in the absence of the other factors that
were discussed in Stone v«_Pgwell, or more particularly where
there has been a full and fair and impartial trial and appellate
review.
We first say that# but then we also say that certainly,
assuming this, certainly we should not depart and extend it to
include even the selection of a foreman.
QUESTION:
issue.

Yes, but that's on the basic constitutional

It isn’t on the applicability of Stone v, Powell.
MR0 LEECH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And on the basis it was hamless error

beyond a reasonable doubt.
MR0 LEECH:

Yes, sir.

Also, that's our other, in addition to the Federal
District judge being correct in finding that the prima facie
case was rebutted by neutral evidence that the decision was
made for reasons other than racial„
QUESTION:

Mrc Attorney General, in the harmless

beyond a reasonable doubt argument, would it not alv;ays be
true that any defect in the grand jury proceeding would be
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, if you got a finding of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at the trial by the petit jury?
MRo LEECH:

Yes, sir, In the absence of an actual

showing of prejudice which I cannot imagine

15

QUESTION:

How can there ever be one when the man is

proved beyond a reasonable doubt to be guilty.

So* wouldn't

that position effectively give the state free hand in doing
whatever it wanted to do with a grand jury?
MRo LEECH:

In the absence of an actual showing of

prejudice -QUESTION:

Even if there was prejudice* wouldn't it

still be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt — i.es( prejudice
at tha grand jury stage* because you see the man had a fair
trial — if we assume the man had a fair trial and was found
guilty?
QUESTION:

In other words* it isnl.tvthe : petit -jury

that determines guilt beyond a reasonable doubts

Doesn't that

wash out any possible error in selection of the grand jury?
MR, LEECH:

Yes* sir* Mr. Chief Justice* although

I would hesitate to say any possible* because I could envision
some grand jury participation beyond their regular role or -QUESTION:

Well* if it turned out that there were

only ten grand jurors and the Tennessee law requires twelve*
maybe there wouldn't be any indictment.
MR, LEECH:
QUESTION:

That's a possibility.

Right,
Wouldn't that even be harmless beyond a

reasonable doubt* because he had been proven guilty at a fair
trial?

I don't see how you are ever going to have any error

under your rationale.

Maybe that’s right, but it seems to me

16

we just eliminate review of grand jury proceedings.
MR. LEECH:

Well# .it's the indictment itself that's

faulty in the Tennessee law.

Whatever occurred in the trial

is void# because a defendant cannot stand trial in Tennessee
without first being indicted.

So# if the indictment is faulty#

and it is shown that it is defective# even in state court -QUESTION:

That's a matter of state law# is it not#

essentially?
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.
I would think then that a bad grand jury

could never be harmless error.
MR. LEECH:

No# sir# not in state court.

In state

court# if you could show that the defendant on trial
QUESTION:

Wasn't validly indicted?

Then his entire

conviction must fall under Tennessee law.
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.
And no one in federal habeas could say

that's harmless error.
MR. LEECH:

I would request to reserve a few moments

for rebuttal.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well# Mr. Attorney

General.
Mr. Kurtz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OP WALTER C. KURTZ , ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OP THE RESPONDENTS *
MR» KURTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves simply, I feel, the enforcement
of the Fourteenth Amendment in federal courts.
The Court of Appeals found discrimination in the
selection of the grand jury foreman, of the grand jury that
indicted the Respondents and reversed their convictions.
The Respondents are asking you to affirm that judgment.
I see the issues as being three.

One, whether there

was discrimination ;Ln the selection of the grand jury foreman.
If so, what is the proper remedy?
And then the third issue, the Stone v. Powell issue,
is federal habeas corpus available in this kind of issue?
Now, the Attorney General has conceded -QUESTION:
MR0 KURTZ:

Which one of those do you reach first?
I had planned to begin with the discrimin­

ation issue in my argument, but of course logically if Your
Honors were to expand Stone v. Powell —
QUESTION:

That’s sort of non-constitutional, isn't

it?
MR0 KURTZ:
QUESTION:
Stone v

The jurisdictional —
Yes, the Stone v0 Powell issue -- If

Powell bars any review here, we never reach a

13

constitutional issue* I take it„
MR, KURTZ:

That'S correct* Your Honor.

I had planned to begin with the discrimination issue
and I will do so* but 1 do concede that point* of course.
The Attorney General has conceded that there was a
prima facie case proven in the District Court.

The District

Court judge found there to be a prima facie case.

And* of

course* obviously* the Court of Appeals agreed.
The District Court and the Court of Appeals* however*
disagreed on whether the prima facie case was rebutted.
Now* what did the state produce in the District Court
in an effort to rebut the prima facie case?
QUESTION:

Mr. Kurtz* before you get to that* would

you tell me what period of time your evidence covered with
respect to no black ever serving as foreman on the grand jury?
MR, KURTZ:

Yes* Your Honor* it covered a period of

time from the early '50s to 1972.
QUESTION:

I say the early '50s —

Continuously?

MR, KURTZ:

That's what the Court of Appeals found*

Your Hon or,
QUESTION:.

What does the record show?

Aren't there

gaps in that evidence?
MR, KURTZ:

Nobody has found there to be gaps* but

there were three prior grand jury foreman testifying*,
who had served in the early '50s.

one

All of whom testified that

19

within their memory they could not recall a black grand jury
foreman.
I suppose it's possible that there was a grand jury
foreman who served in that period of time not called* and in
that respect there may be a gap* but -QUESTION:

One of the three testified hs didn't know

at all* so you are down to two.
MRo KURTZ:

I don't recall that* Your Honor.

As I

recall the record* all three said that they did not believe
there had ever been a black grand jury foreman.
QUESTION:

While we are in that area and since I

take it you are a practitioner in that area* do you know* as
an officer of the court* whether any judge of that court has*
since 1900* let us say* been Negro?
MRo KURTZ:

No* Your Honor* I do not.

I'm from

Nashville* which is approximately 180 miles from Tipton County
and have no personal knowledge* just as the Attorney General.
It is a good deal geographically removed from where I am.
QUESTION:
MR» KURTZ:

What's the city near?
Covington* Tennessee* is the county seat*

Your Honor.
And I would correct the Attorney General in one
thing.

Tipton County does border on Shelby County* and rather

than being in the Northwest corner* it is in the Southwest
corner of the state.

20
QUESTION:
MR, KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Well, Shelby is Memphis.
Yes, Your Honor.
Well, there is at least one Negro judge

In Memphis.
MR. KURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I will return to the state's efforts to rebut the
prima facie case in the Federal District Court.
They submitted an affidavit from the state trial
judge in which the state trial judge said that he had chosen
the grand jury foreman that Indicted the Respondent, because
this individual had served before and his regular foreman was
going to be out of the county.

Then he sums up, in his last

sentence of his affidavit, quote -■= this is in the Appendix
at page 113 -- "I don't think I have really given any thought
to appointing a black foreman, but I have no feeling against
doing so."
He had never given any thought to the appointing of
a black grand jury foreman.
The state also submitted the affidavit of the grand
jury foreman who tells .us that he did not vote on the indictment.
Now, once a prima facie case is shown, I say the state
has a much greater obligation than to just come into court with
an affidavit of the selecting officer

saying that he didn't

choose this person because of race.
As a matter of fact, the affidavit is much stronger

21

than that because the affidavit indicates that he did not even
consider blacks.
But what didn’t they show?
black had ever been considered»

There is no proof that a

no proof that a black had ever

served* no proof as to what criteria was used# no proof of any
rational selection procedure# like personal interviews# etcetera.
And there is absolutely* certainly no proof that the blacks in
Tipton County were unqualified to serve,
QUESTION:

What if you had a case — this is hypo­

thetical now »=* where since Tennessee was admitted to the Union
the record showed that the judge of this court that we are
dealing with had always been a white male.

Would you be making

the same argument you make here in this case?
MR0 KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MRo KURTZ:
QUESTION:

I don't think so# Your Honor* because
Why not?
In Tennessee* judges are elected.
Well* the electorate can be biased and

d is criminatory* as well as individuals 5 isn't that so?
MR0 KURTZ:

That's certainly true* Your Honor* but I

don't think that this Court has ever involved itself in the
motivation of individual voters that comprise an electorate,
QUESTION:

That shouldn't stop you.

We never decided

what the Sixth Circuit decided here either.
MR, KURTZ:

It may not stop me# Mr. Chief Justice* but

of course I am not here to argue that point.

22

QUESTION:

No, but we often explore with hypothetical

questions the reach of an argument that's presented to us,
MR, KURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor,

But I do think the selection process there is
certainly different, certainly susceptible to the exercise of
racial prejudice, but nothing that this Court has ever entered
into,

I don't believe that it would be proper for the Court

to enter into that sort of political judgment as to why voters
are motivated to elect who they do.
The prima facie case is important, and what the state
failed to prove is important, because the prima facie case
shifts the burden of proof.
Now, the judge did tell us that he did not consider
blacks.

He gave them no thought.

A person who selects members

of the grand jury has a duty to become familiar with persons
eligible for jury service, a duty to refrain from a course of
conduct that naturally tends —
QUESTION:

He didn't select the members of the grand

jury, did he?
MR, KURTZ:
term. Your Honor,

No, I use that in a sort of generic

I am talking about the grand jury foreman.

-- but a duty to refrain from a course of conduct.
This Court's cases have never allowed a simple
protestation that "I didn't mean to discriminate1' to be suf­
ficient to overcome a prima facie case.

23

In this case, we have far more than a simple
protestation that "I didn’t mean to discriminate."
the statement that "I did not consider blacks."

We have

"I didn't

give them any thought, although I don’t have anything against
them."
I think we have clearly proved a case of discrimination.
QUESTION:

In the process of the petit jury that

tries criminal cases, who does the selecting there?
MRo KURTZ:

The petit jury is chosen from the master

jury list or venire, Your Honor, and it comes from the same
basic pot of jurors that the grand jurors are drawn from.
QUESTION:

What's the mechanics of actually bringing

forty or fifty or a hundred people in at a given time?
District Court or jury commissioner, or what?
MR. KURTZ:

Commissioners choose the master jury

list, but then, as I recall, the clerk administers a system by
which names are put in a pot.

Until recently, a 10 year-old

child was brought in and drew out names at random.
to serve the grand jury.

They went

They went to serve the criminal

court juries, the civil court juries.
But then completely outside of that is the judge's
personal sort of selection procedure, where he can reach out
into the general population and choose anybody he or she wants
as the foreman, or foreperson, of the grand jury.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kurtz, I am a little bit concerned

24

about the same point that Mr. Justice Blackmun raised with
you earlier about the actual existence of a prima facie case.
As I understand it. the magistrate to whom the
District Court referred this matter decided that you had made
out a prima facie case.

The District Court then, without

opinion, denied relief, and the Court of Appeals reversed the
District Court.
Now, what standard does the Court of Appeals review?
Is that clearly an erroneous test?
MRo KURTZ:

I don’t believe it's a clearly erroneous

test, Your Honor, because, for one thing, there was no evi­
dentiary hearing in the District Court, none whatsoever.

It

was based solely upon the statistical Information available,
that there hadn't been any blacks, and the judge's affidavit.
So, I don't think a clearly erroneous rule applies for an
additional reason also, in that we have mixed questions of
law and fact here, obviously.

And the clearly erroneous rule

does not apply to that.
I also agree with your
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals didn't send it back

for an evidentiary hearing.

It simply said the habeas issue,

didn't it?
MR. KURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor, because I think that

they felt competent that the district judge had applied the
facts =“ or the law improperly to the facts 0

25
QUESTION:

Did the state aver have an opportunity to

rebut the prima facie case* even if the district court had
agreed with the magistrate that a prima facie case had been
made out?

MR0 KURTZ:

Yes* Your Honor* and I do disagree with

you that the District Court did not find a prima facie case.
I would refer Your Honor to the District Court's decision on
page 99 of the Appendix* the first paragraph.

This is the

District Court judge saying* "It would appear that a prima
facie case has been made with respect to discrimination in the
selection of the foreman of the grand jury."
Only then did the district judge allow the state an
opportunity to file affidavits* and only then did the state
\

file the affidavit of the District Court judge -- excuse me*
the affidavit of the state court judge and the affidavit of_fche foreman of the grand jury.
QUESTION:

You said the District Court gave the state

an opportunity to respond.
MR» KURTZ:

Yes* Your Honor,

Now* let me turn quickly to the issue of relief*
which I think is one of the key issues in the case* obviously*
and I suppose what legitimately -- the legitimate questions
about the fact that the foreman did not vote in this matter.
The traditional remedy has always been avoiding the
indictment for discrimination in grand jury cases as well as

26

petit jury.

But many of this Court’s cases have involved

solely grand juries.

Bush v. Kentucky,, the first one that

involved solely the grand jury, 1883.

And then through more

recent cases, Alexander v. Louisiana, Peters v. Klff and then
Castaneda.
What of the importance of the foreman in this case?
The record in that regard does not contain many facts.

The

only thing we know, on page 23 of the Appendix, is the foreman
who served at this particular grand jury, telling us, "I usually
question the witness first to get basic information to the
attention of the members of the grand jury.

And then 1 ask

each witness that has been examined if there is anyone in the
room that wants to ask further questions of the witness.

They

are, each and every one, given an opportunity to question the
witness."
So, he controls the availability of the witness and
when to break off the giving of evidence.
But what more does he or she do?
Under Tennessee law, the grand jury is an entity
made up of thirteen members.

The foreman is the presiding

officer and leader of the grand jury.
Studies in small group dynamics would certainly
indicate the force that a leader of such a small group can
exercise.

All of us who practice criminal law and have some

knowledge of grand juries and petit juries realize the
ur'j'

27

tremendous influence of the foreman.

room.

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that --

QUESTION:

I don't know what happens in a grand jury

Now, if you are in the habit of going in, you are in a

different category from me.

I don't go in on them.

all lawyers were prevented from going in.

I thought

Is that true in

Tennessee?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

That is also true in Tennessee.
How do you know what goes on in there?

MR. KURTZ:

Well, we don’t know exactly what goes on.

but I think vie are well aware of certainly the power of the
foreman of the petit jury, the power of any chairman or leader
of a small group.

And we can extrapolate from that as to the

power of the foreman.
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that a member of the

grand jury, any member of the grand jury, can call any witness
he or she wants to call?
MR. KURTZ:

No, Your Honor, I don't suggest that,

and I don't disagree with what the Attorney General said about
that.
QUESTION:

You implied in your statement that the

foreman dictated what witnesses were going to be heard.

That’s

not so at all, is it?
MR. KURTZ: Not as a matter of law, but I think as a

28
matter of just controling the proceeding.
QUESTION:

When they are satisfied with what's

presented to them, that's one thing* but is not the prosecuting
attorney some factor in what witnesses are going to be pre­
sented to a grand jury?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. KUHTZ:
QUESTION:

Oh* absolutely.
He is the dominant factor* isn't he?
That is true.
Unless Tennessee is different from all

the other states of the Union.
MR0 KURTZ:

Tennessee is not different in that

regard* Your Honor* and I didn't mean to create that impres­
sion.

But I wanted to impart the information that the fore­

man does occupy a most important role.

In this particular

case* the foreman interviewed the witnesses ahead of time
and brought them in.

But I don't suggest that the foreman is

more powerful in that regard than* say* the District Attorney
General.
QUESTION:
issue?

Are you coming back to the Stone v. Pot-el r.

lecause I would ‘like to ask you some questions whenever

appropriate.
MR. KURTZ:

Yes* Your Honor.

I will reach that*

but of course I'd be glad to address it.
QUESTION:

No* if you are arguing another point* but

you. mentioned Castaneda and some other cases a little while ago

29
and I thought you were going to continue with the Stone v.
Powell argument.
Carry on and let me know when you get to it.
MR. KURTZ:

I will definitely get to it. Your Honor.

Furthermore# the grand jury foreman must sign the
Indictment in Tennessee or the indictment is void# even if the
grand jury foreman does not vote.

And# of course# the grand

jury foreman has certain statutory duties even out of term.
I think all these things are outlined in great
detail in the briefs of this case.
Why the voiding of the indictment?
QUESTION:

You said the grand jury foreman must sign

the indictment.
The indictment need be returned by only twelve of
the grand jurors?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor.
So# If the foreman v/ere the thirteenth

and he disagreed with the action of the twelve# he would
nonetheless be required to sign it; is that correct?
MR. KURTZ:

Yes# Your Honor.

The foreman is the spokesperson of the grand jury.
The grand jury can only act vis-a-vis the court through the
foreman# but I don’t suggest that the foreman could somehow
refuse to sign.

He would have to sign or I assume he would be

subject to mandamus.

30

This Court has always supported the remedy of the
voting of indictments, by two theories, both used, I think.
The presumption of prejudice.

Certain circumstances are so

susceptible to abuse that the Court will assume prejudice.
I think this is a recognition of the evidentiary problems that
are present if you had to prove actual discrimination in court.
Grand jury secrecy.

Most difficult.

In the Castaneda case, for instance, I don't believe
that there is any proof of actual prejudice.

This Court

has always assumed that to be a legitimate rationale in support
of that rule.
Then the rule of judicial integrity.

While the

rationale of judicial integrity has fallen in, well, bad times
in the Fourth Amendment area, it has-not fallen in bad times in
this area.
For instance, in Your Honors' case, Peters v. Kiff,
you allowed a white defendant standing to challenge grand jury
discrimination because blacks had been excluded.

I think that

that is a strong statement that this Court adheres to the
rationale of judicial integrity.
Chief Justice Stone said, in an older case. Hill v.
Texas, "The conviction cannot stand because the Constitution
prohibits the procedure by which it was obtained.

Equal

Protection of the law is something more than abstract right.
It is a command which the state must respect, the benefits of

31

which every person may demand.

Not the least of our constitu­

tional system is that its safeguards extend to all, the least
deserving as well as to the most virtuous."
\

Now, Mr. Justice Powell, I will turn to the Stone
argument.
QUESTION:

May we start out by my asking you who

was injured in this case by the foreman of the grand jury
having been selected in a discriminatory manner?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. KURTZ:

I think the Defendants.
How was he injured?
Both of them were injured, Your Honor,

because their personal Fourteenth Amendment rights were
)

violated.
QUESTION:

In what respect?

Are you challenging

the composition of the petit jury?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
Is any error before us today in the

trial that you are asserting?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
So you stand here today challenging only

the validity of the grand jury that indicted him?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And, again I ask you:

How was your client

injured if he were tried and convicted by a jury properly
selected?

32

MRa KURTZ:

Well* again* I must say because their

personal Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated.,
QUESTION:

Were your clients’ rights violated In

terms of judicial integrity* as you use that tern, any more
than the public generally?
MR. KURTZ:

Well* I think they were both violated*

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

You concede your client had a fair trial*

and he was found guilty.
least three courts.
MR., KURTZ:

That guilt

has been affirmed by at

You are not challenging that?
For purposes of this hearing* I do not

challenge that, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

What is the purpose, the historical

purpose, of habeas corpus?
MR, KURTZ:

I believe the historical purpose of

habeas corpus prior
QUESTION:

It had something to do with innocence,

didn't it?
MR, KURTZ:

Yes, Your Honor, it had something to do

X'jith Innocence.
QUESTION:
MR, KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR, KURTZ:

Is Innocence involved in this case at all?
No, Your Honor.
All right,
But habeas corpus law has changed con-

siderably since it had something to do with innocence, as you

33
say* and also has to do with the jurisdiction of the court.
QUESTION:

Habeas corpus has to do with release from

unlawful confinement that may or may not have something to do
with innocence in a particular case.

But it is release from

unlawful confinement* isn^fc it?
MR, KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes and Congress —
Sometimes it has to do with innocence*

sometimes it doesn't.
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But is there any unlawful confinement in

this case?
MR, KURTZ:

Yes* Your Honor.

If we look back over

one hundred years of this Court's decision enforcing the
Fourteenth Amendment* I think there is no doubt that this
conviction was obtained in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
and* therefore* under the federal habeas statute -QUESTION:

The indictment --

Which is the first case you rely upon?
MR, KURTZ:

I would start with Strauder v. West

Virginia* Your Honor.
QUESTION:

The attack there was on the petit jury

as well as the grand jury.
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. KURTZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.
What itfas the next case?
Bush v

an 1883 case* in which

34
the attack was solely on the grand jury.
QUESTION:

Was the issue you are arguing here today

argued In that case?
MR* KURTZ:

No* Your Honor* but there is a case in

which the issue that interests Your Honor was argued*
QUESTION:
MR* KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR* KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR* KURTZ:

Which case was that?
That is Cassell v* Texas* a 1950 case ~
Was that a habeas corpus case?
No* it is not* Your Honor*
That's a very different case then*
The issue on habeas corpus has never

been addressed by Your Honors*
QUESTION:
MR* KURTZ:
QUESTION:
MR* KURTZ:

This is a novel case in that respect?
It is* Your Honor.
That's my point.
But I would like to submit that there are

tremendous differences In this case and in .Stone v* Powsll
which should not lead to the same result*

They are the dif­

ferences between the exclusionary rule and the remedy in this
case*

The rationales are different.

The rationale

voiding

the indictment in this case is supported by presumed prejudice*
judicial Integrity* and maybe deterrence* but only maybe*
possibly* deterrence*
This Court's decisions have never rested on that.
The exclusionary rule is based on deterrence alone.

35
The recognition that deterrent effect is attenuated so greatly
on federal habeas corpus that in a balancing procedure this
Court recognizes that there are certain interests more important
than the deterrent effect in enforcing
QUESTION:

*

Are you familiar with Justice Stewart’s

opinion to the Court in Elkins v. United States?
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor»
That came out a number of years ago»

I

think it spoke quite substantially about judicial integrity
r

in connection with the Fourth Amendment»
MR» KURTZ:

Yes , but as I read Stone v<> Powell ,

Your Honors have rejected such a rationale in the area of the
l

Fourth Amendment, or if not rejected certainly entered into
a balancing test, a balancing test that has never been used by
this Court in grand jury discrimination cases»
QUESTION:

That had to do with the exclusionary rule,

and it did, as my brother Rehnquist correctly recollects,
emphasize the interests of judicial Integrity in connection
with the exclusionary rule -MR» KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor»
— which is a corollary to the Fourth

Amendment -MR» KURTZ:

I certainly recognize that and support

it, but I don't think that that rationale is supported by
this Court’s decision in Stone v» Powell»

36
QUESTION:

You said in response to a question from

Mr. Justice Stewart earlier that indictment can be only by
twelve votes of a grand jury and not by information, as in
some states.
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

Yes., Your Honor.
Suppose Tennessee law allowed a charge to

be Instituted, even in a homocide case, by information from
the prosecutor, and it appeared that prosecutors ever since
Tennessee had been a member of the Union had been white males
appointed by the Governor, since you don't want to get into
the election process.

Would your argument be the same if the

charge had been instituted by that particular prosecutor?
MR. KURTZ:

I think that that could raise substantial

questions as to the validity of the charges, if it was shown
that racial discrimination had been exercised in the selection
of the prosecutor.
I would admit that that would raise tremendous dif­
ficulties in our system of justice.

It obviously would not be

as easy to administer as this rule is in a grand jury.
QUESTION:

First you would try out the prosecutor

before you could try the defendant.

As here, you want to try

out the grand jury before you try the defendant.
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

That's possible, Your Honor.
Obviously, the integrity of the grand jury

is important to society.

No one questions that.

What other

37

-

ways may the grand jury integrity be protected legally, apart
from the type action that you have here today?
MR* KURTZ:

Well, of course, the grand jury integrity

could be protected by the Federal Criminal Statute,
such a statute, 18 U.S. Code 243*

There is

Class action lawsuits as

used in Carter v« Jury Commission.
QUESTION:
MR. KURTZ:
QUESTION:

And Turner v„ Fouche.
Yes, Your Honor,
And, of course, there can be direct

attack on direct appeal in the state court and this Court
also.
MR. KURTZ:
I

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So, there are at least three other ways,

without resorting to habeas corpus,
MR. KURTZ:

That’s correct.

There are alternatives

available, but I think that there are legitimate differences
between the exclusionary rule and the rule in this case.

It

does not appear that we are going to be able to get into —
My time is up now.
Thank you,very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Mr. Attorney General?

Do you have anything

38
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. LEECH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF the PETITIONER
o

MR. LEECH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Just very briefly, I would conclude that the
Fourteenth Amendment rights have not always, universally,
uniformly been protected by the vehicle of habeas corpus,
such as where a state law requires that the plea be filed in
advance and it isn't done.

Then the individual would be

barred from raising it for not having raised it timely.
Another is in a case where there is a guilty plea,

1?)
as in Pollack, where a guilty plea some twenty years later
the defendant could not come back to be heard.
I would simply say that there are other means for
attacking discrimination in the systematic exclusions of
members of recognized classes from participation in society,
whether it be -- whether or not it's a school board appointment
or whether it affects the judiciary.

If it affects the judic­

iary, the Supreme Court of the State involved may, by its in­
herent rule-making power, promulgate guidelines and procedures
to follow for the trial bench in functioning through its ap­
pointed powers.
In addition to the class action in the traditional —
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you are not sug­

gesting this Court should promulgate rules for the Tennessee

39
courts to follow* are you?
MR. LEECH:

No* sir.

I said the state court.

If

t

the Supreme Court of the State of Tennessee perceives -this Is a statewide system we have — perceives that there
have been numerous violations or it is not working as a system
because of the propensities of some appointed judges —
QUESTION:

What if* as in this case* the Supreme

Court of Tennessee perceived there was no problem and the
federal judges thought there was a problem? Isn’t that the heart
of the matter?
MR. LEECH:

That's the heart of the matter* yes* sir.

And I would say that that* I suppose* is the deter­
rent factor under which the rationale of federal habeas corpus
has been used heretofore in Fourteenth Amendment questions.
We are simply saying in modern context, today* that
ample remedy is available and that in this kind of case* where
a full and fair and impartial hearing has already transpired*
that should be limited.
QUESTION:

Is it generally considered a full* fair

and impartial hearing when the judge whose conduct is under
review is the judge who Is reviewing that conduct* which is
what we have here?

The trial judge was passing on the suf­

ficiency of his own handling of the matter* wasn't he?
MR. LEECH:

Passing on the plea in abatement* which

went to the selection of the fore -- which would be his

40
appointment* yes* sir»
QUESTION:

Is that normally an adequate* full and

fair hearing of the issue, when you have a judge trying himself*
in effect?
MR. LEECH:

Your Honor, he would be trying the

issue presented to him as to whether or not there was — and
he did submit his affidavit -QUESTION:
procedure.

They said he did not follow the proper

That was the challenge* whether he followed the

proper procedure.
MR,, LEECH:

If Your Honor please, it wasn't so much

following the proper procedure as much as it was the charge
being discriminating by intentionally excluding blacks.

And I

don't think that*when his affidavit is read as a whole* sub­
mitted into the record* is what he said.

He simply said he

seldom* if ever* appointed people and when he did he simply
reappointed those who had been there* and he had really never
considered —
QUESTION:

And then he read his own affidavit and

decided that didn't show discrimination,
MR. LEECH:

Yes* sir,

And then he also presided

as the trial judge for the petit jury* but then that was re­
viewed by the Criminal Court of Appeals* in reviewing the
entire record, and then the Supreme Court in reviewing tne
record,

41

QUESTION:

But the issue as to a full and fair trials

as I understood it, didn't relate to whether or not the foreman
of the grand jury had been properly selected *

The issue so far

as habeas corpus being a proper remedy relates to whether or
not there was full and fair trial of the defendant by the
petit jury and the judge who presided over it.
MR. LEECH:

Yes, sir, on the merits of the indictment

as returned o
QUESTION:
v. Powell test.

That's a different test from the Stone

Under Stone v, Powell, the issue on the full

and fair hearing isn't just the trial,' it is whether there
was a hearing on the issue of whether or not the evidence had

been illegally seized.
MR. LEECH:
QUESTION:

Isn't that right?
Yes, sir.

Is that what you are asking for?

Or

are you just saying whenever there is a fair trial that's the
end of the matter?

That's kind of an extension of Stone v,

Powell.
MR. LEECH:
that it does involve

I am not saying that at all.

I am saying

VJe say there was a full and fair

hearing on the plea in abatement itself, but that did not go

to the trial of the case.
QUESTION:

But in order for your theory of Stone v.

Powell to apply, we would have to decide that there was a full
and fair hearing by the judge on the issue of discrimination in

42

picking the grand jury foreman.
Isn't that right?
MR, LEECH:

Your Honor, maybe I missed it, but I

was under the impression that our theory is that there was a
full and fair hearing on every aspect in the accusatory spectrum,
including a full appellate review and post conviction remedy,
as a system,
QUESTION:

Let's be precise.

If there was not a full

and fair hearing at the trial court level in the state system
on the question whether the grand jury foreman had been picked
improperly, there was not a full and fair hearing by the trial
judge in Tennessee, would or would not Stone v, Powell bar

MR, LEECH:

Yes, sir, it would be reviewable in the

QUESTION:

No, no,

I said would it be reviewable

in the federal court on that hypothesis?
MR, LEECH:

No, sir, under our contention that it

should be expanded to include this Issue -QUESTION:

You say Stone v, Powell would bar, even if

there was not a fair hearing by the state trial judge on the
issue raised in the federal habeas corpus proceeding?

Yes, sir.
