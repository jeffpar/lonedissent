ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. BROSNAHAN, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT ~ Resumed
MR® BROSNAHAN;

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court $
Yesterday the government argued that the Court need
not address itself to th© more serious issues in the case
because th© fact was, so the government argued, that the
Attorney General had in fast, or at least somebody.in the
office had approved electronic surveillance after the fact,
find that this Court should rest its judgment upon that position,
thus undercutting respondent9® request that the heavier issue©
©f th© cats© be addressed®
There are a number of reasons why that, we think, is
not appropriate®
First, in Fourth Amendment eases, where there is
suppression, there is no examination to determine whether or
not a warrant would b© i©?3u@d0
No® 2, th© only document that ever went to the
Attorney G©n@ral9s office, which is on page 78 of the record,
contains in it a statement, and I seek not to

use the

prajoratlv© feam but some accurate terra, contains in it a

34

statement which is false, which is relevant, and highly
relevant? and on page 78, the statement that I refer to is,
and I quote from the Internal Beverm a Service to the Department
of Justice:
"During a telephone conversation on January 29, 1975,
Caceres referred to his January 27, 575, offer to Y@e and
asked Ye® to meet with him on January 31, 19 75,69
Not true, clearly not true, and relevant, highly
relevant to the question of why approval had not been asked for
before that»
h third point is that in Exhibit 1, which is
Government's Exhibit 1, it is a memorandum of 1972 from the
Department of Justice to agencies, talking about this
regulatory plan, and in there, on page 7 there is a quota
which says, "It should be clearly understood that the use of
consensual devises will not be authorised retrospectively."
And finally our position is 'that the Court, this
Court should not ba asked to try to piece together from
inconclusive evidence what the Attorney General might have
done had it bam presented in a proper way*
Yaaterday 1 was also discussing the legislativa
history, which I'd like to mention again in a couple of
r©©p®cts, because 1 think it is tremendously helpful to
understand the nature of f2h®s© regulations, and our position
which i@ that they were intended to convey ban©fits to a

35
group of people which included the respondent in this case»
The hearings in the Senate

and this is in our

brief °»» included findings that there were routine eavesdroppings
©n meetings between federal tax agents and taxpayers»
was thought to be a grievance®

That

It was thought to be something

that should b® prevented»
And ©ur position here really, and this case, at
least to me, seems feo be quite different than the usual
Fourth Amendment analysis, this case involves a determination
by federal officials as to what was right and what was not
right®

Wh&t the privacy interests were and what they were not»

How comprehensive the rule should be, or how narrow it should be»
And all of this was set out in writing, and went into an

announcement to the public and to the Senate*

And we think

that it is at least helpful that at a time when the Senate was
considering legislation, the Executive Branch went and said,
£5We have passed regulations63® The olear import of which is
that the Legislature need not examine this particular item
further.
And, as I mentioned yesterday, Attorney General Levi
in 1975 again was referring to these regulations as an
important part of the protection that was being offered»
We submit to the Court, that these regulations are
not housekeeping regulations, and so the Sullivan case doesn1!
help the government very much®

36

More than that*, and we see this as an issue that
certainly would concern the Court# rights were to be given#
so said the officials who talked about these regulations# and
they were to he given to a group of people and that group of
people included the respondent# my client# because he was a
taxpayer and he was talking to a federal agent? and that was
precisely the class of people that were to ba protected by
this regulation»
We do not think# respondent does not think that when
the officials passed these regulations they had in mind txtfo
Glasses of evidence# and this really is the government’s posi­
tion hero# and it is hard# at least for me# to comprehend it»
Whan the Attorney General favored these regulations# when the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue favored these regulations#
and when the President of the United States indicated general
support for regulations of this kind# we think they did not
have in mind two classes of evidence# one which would be
obtained in pursuant to the authority# and the other obtained
in violation of it»

And so the argument by the government

that there’s 21© intention to have this suppressed# we think
ie wid© of tlia mark»
W® also say that the distinction offered by the
government between whether these regulations ar© law or not
diOQS not earry thsra very far»

Our position is that these

regulations are law# and that it is really not a very attractive

3?
distinction to argue that they ara just regulations and there­
fore are to be given a sort of a second-class status»
QUESTION i Would you agree, Mre Brosnahan# that this
issue arises only,to a court at least, when there is a motion
to suppress the evidence?
MR» BROSNAHAN:

I think that's right, Mre Chief

Justice»
QUESTIONS And the motion to suppress is made in the
context# as here# where the evidence obtained was evidence of
an effort ©f the taxpayer to bribe the agent?
MR» BROSNAHANs Well# that

that is true# but of

course the regulation is geared to the investigatory stag®»
I think

that's on© point I'd like to make# thinking afoout

y®sterday's argument9 is that w© have not gone and gotten some
obscure regulation and brought it in and said somehow it
should play a part in the criminal case0

We come# in a case

in some ways I think is stronger for the defendant than the
Jacobs case was# because the regulation is geared to govern
the activities of Internal Revenue Service agents as they
gather evidence in the criminal context»
aimed at

criminal procedure»

This is a regulation

So w@ think that it is very close

to the strongest kind of eas© that on© can have for a r©gula*=
tion# and 'then# as Your Honor points out# it would arise in
the motion feo suppress»
QUESTION?

If you prevail# would# in your view# this

38
apply to all regulations and rules governing law enforcement
officers, policemen?
MR® BRQSN&HANs

No* Your Honor, 1 don't think it

would,
QUESTION s Why not?
MR® BROSNAHANs

I think that there would be sorting

out to be done*, but# as far as I'm concerned,, arguing here,
you can immediately sort out the housekeeping kinds of
regulationsi some of which have already been identified by
this Court in the past, that don't really go to conferring
benefits to private citizens®
QUESTION?

What, for example, if a police regulation

of an ordinary city police force required that before making
any forcible entry under a warrant, or otherwise, where it
was justified, or fore© was justified, a policeman should not
only announce that he is a policeman, but give his name, rank
and serial number, so that the person Inside would have some
means of knowing that this was indeed a policeman authorized
to make an entry?

Would a violation of that lead to suppression

©f the evidence obtained inside?
MR® BR0SNAHA13 s

1 wouldn * fc want to argue today

forcefully that it would necessarily, or that it follows as
night th© day that it would be suppressed®

I think that I

would have to examine the purpose of that regulation. Your
Honor, that said it's for the purpose of letting the people

39
Iasida know who it is*

And then I guess you would really

have to examine the ease pretty closely*
But I would say this, this cas© presents the question
of a federal regulation aimed at federal officials, and it has
and 1 don't think '.this is an artificial argument, 1 hope
that it’s not — it has & ' quality to it that is not found in
almost any other ruling that this Court could make*

If the

Court rules that the curtilage, which is a term sometimes
used, doss or does not include the front porch, the officer,
particularly the Stata officer is standing out there trying
to remember what the major opinion was and what the dissenting
opinion was, and whether he can or cannot arrest on fch© front
porch•
In this case we have regulations drafted by the
Executive that really are quit© clear* Certainly in this
context they say to the agent and everyone

these are

federal agents, and in the record we show that they were
teaching them about these regulations ~ that they cannot
proceed unless fcbsy have the authority from the Attorney General’s
office*

That’s clear* That does not present the kind of

justifiable confusion or difficulty that law enforcement
officers have*
So we think that that’s a distinction*
I think that I would like to talk about Aceardi and
due process, because the government has come to the Court and

40
has argued that Accardi really doesn't involve due process t
©nd that due process °*» if I understood my colleague9 Mr»
Cellar®s argument yesterday ~ in the criminal context is
somehow lower than in the employment context»

I believe that

that's the government's argument»
But* at any rate„ of course, our position is that in
the criminal investigatory process due process has a great
part to play and that it should be applied in this casa»
Let me mak© an assertion and the Court can judge
whether it is accurate or not»

We think that it has been

the uninterrupted judicial belief/ at least sine© the
government conceded the. due process point in the Dulles ease,
21 years agoff that fehs government's obligation to follow its
own rule® was rooted in the du© process clause»
QUESTIONS

Wall, Mr® Brosnahan, Accardi certainly

wasn't a due process ease, wag it?
MR® BROSNAHAN:

I think that it was 0 Justice

Rehnquist,
QUESTION? Did it say so?
MR® BRQSNAHAN: It does not use the term»
QUESTIONs And didn't Horowitz last year say that
Accardi and those cases ware grounded in federal administrative
law?
MR» BRQSNAHAN-s

That's what I would call fha

residual clause in Footnote 8# the very bottom of footnote 8,

41
there Is a commente
QUESTIONS

You feel that Footnote 8 isn’t a part of

the ©pinion?
MR, BRQSNAHAN:
Court,

I feel that will ba up for the

But 1 d© not© that it is at the very bottom of the

footnote9 and that one other Justice described it as confusing
dictum,
QUESTION:

Tha majority joined it# didn°t it?

MR, BRQSNAHAN:

Yes„ surely.

And I'm serious about

say observation# I don't think that I can argue what the
Court should ©r should not do with, Footnote

B?

but I would

say this* that there may be -■=* and I've tried to make an
accurate number estimate of the number ©f cases out there in
the Circuits and in the district courts,, where judges, for
20 yearss have thought that Accardl meant due process? and my
guess is that there's somewhere over a hundred cases,
QUESTION:

And you think we're bound by them as

opposed to Horowitss?
MR, BRQSNAHAN:

No,

I don't think -- clearly this

Court is not bound by what lower courts do, except that we
would argue that when hundreds of lower courts take a position„

/ T

that that is simply something that can be judged along with
everything else,
QUESTION %

Maybe they were following each other

instead of this Court,

42
MR® BROSNAHANs

That* s entirely possible®

tod I realise that here this is a matter, in soma
ways, of first impression®
But we do say that the number, and even the quality
of soma of these opinions, would be something that could be
considered*

We also say 'that in Bridges vs® Wixon the rules

in that ease, before Aceardi, and it is cited in Accardi, as
Your Honor knows, in the Aceardi decision, that there there
was involved the government taking of statements

pretty

close to our case, really? although there is a phrase in
Bridges that indicates that there was an indication that such
statements would not be used®
QUESTION:

And you've emphasised, Mr® Brosnahan, that

various federal officials, including the former Attorney
General, had taken a position on this, the present Attorney
General and present Solicitor General have taken a different
view of what those officers meant, does he not, by bringing this
cas© feo the Court?
MR® BROSNAHAN.; Absolutely®

But we say, and we don't

mean to be —» I wish to put this correctly and nos disrespect­
fully to fcheir position — I mean to say, if ‘the Court please,
that I' rather doubt that th© officials in -the federal government
who mad® this promis® to the public would take the position
that is here* And since it is a promise, and I don't mean it
in the loosa sens©, this is a due process sense, when the

43
people are told that a certain thing will happen, we are here
today to argue that the government must do that. And that
that is due process.

That is Accardi„ And that whatever else

heppans in this ease, whatever this Court might decide, to
accept the government's position today that this Court should
whittle ©way on due process, it's »-»
QOESTXOHs Well, it's one thing, Mr. Brosnahan, to
suggest that that promise, as you call it, should be enforced,
which it can be by dismissal of the. employees who fail to
comply with it, as the regulations provide; it's quite
a
«mother to say that the hard, undisputed evidence of/feaxpayer
bribing an Internal Revenue Agent should ba excluded from the
jury as a consequence of that, in addition to the dismissal
or discipline of the employee.
MR. BROSNAHAN:

Let me speak to that, Mr. Chief

Justics, because I think in many ways that is the most important
issue in the case.
QUESTION s Because tills is an ~ you are proposing
an extension, are you not, of the exclusionary rule?
MR. BROSNAHANs

We don't think so, and I think

Franks raally deals with the question of what is or is not an
extension. At least our view of it is that when due process
is violated, by our view, under the Fifth Amendment the courts
have the power to suppress that

kind of evidence. And we

don't believe that this is an extension.

Yefe it has some new

44
aspects to it-, but we don’t believe that it’s an extension*
Let me speak to why the respondent believes that this
is a proper case for suppression*
First of all, this Court has carefully examined the
rational® for suppression and it comes to the view that the
dominant rationale is deterrence, and we accept that for the
purposes of this argument, And here the deterrent

and I

think the Ninth Circuit saw this, the deterrence here is
direct®

Hero are federal agents, told by their superiors to

proceed in a certain way, and they do not? Conceded by the
government, the violation is conceded by the governments.
Now, th® daterrene© of the Court, taking the same
position that th® executive official took, to wit, if you
do this you ar© in violation of this regulatio», is consistent
and would lead to direct and logical and fair types

of

deterrence of federal officials,
[sic]
It is interesting to note that Agent Hill in this
ease stated, under examination, that ha was familiar with
these regulations *=*“> something that very few agents could say
with regard to the more complicated Fourth. Amendment analysis
that’s sometimes required to know whether they're doing the
right thing,,
TIis cases that this Court has considered recently,
where you have found that suppression was not the proper

in
remedy, include Calandra, Stone and Janis, and/each of those

45
eases the Court was faced with a problem of suppression in a
proceeding other than a federal criminal trial* habeas
corpus* grand jury witnesses* civil proceedings»
Hare the government proposes to introduce in a federal
criminal trial evidence which it has obtained in violation of
this regulation.
There is an argument* or certainly an inference by
the government that other sanctions are adequate* and we say
that Franks is an answer to that.
Wa also not® that in nineteen* 1 believe it's either
372 or *74* when an audit was done of how the compliance was
going with regard to these regulations * the facts are in our
brief* and it shows that it wasn't going very well.

And so w®

say it is not an isolated instance* as argued by the
government* but rather a matter of serious import®
QUESTION:

Mr. Brosnahan* you make the point* as I

understand you* that there was a violation of the due process
clause.
MR. BROSMAHAN%
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.

When did the violation occur?

MR. BROSNAHAN:

I would say* Mr. Justice Stevens*

that when the government seeks to use the product against the
defendant* that the violation occurs at that point.
QUESTION*

It would b® a violation to use evidence

obtained in this illegal way against a defendant at his

46
criminal trial, that's your point?
MR® BROSNAHANs

Yes, Justice Stevens»

That's our

position®
QUESTION:

Well, that question contains a conclusion

of course that it's illegal, whereas you have

said it’s a

violation not of a law but of a regulation governing employees
of the *»■»
MR® BROSNAHANs
QUESTION:

It is a regulation, but ~

Is that, per ss, illegal whan it's done,

whan the act is performed?
MR0 BROSNAHANs
QUESTION:

We think —•

Taking up Mr» Justice Stewards point»

MR» BROSNAHANs We think that it’s illegal when it is
done® And one reason
QUESTION: But it isn't a violation of due process
until they offer it in evidence?
That's what I understood if as your answer to

■— the

combined answer to Mr® Justice Stevens and Mr® Justice Stewart®
MR® BROSNAHANs

It is certainly a violation of due

process by our view when it is sought to be introduced®
QUESTION:

You're not giving- up your right of privacy

point, are you?
MR® BROSNAHANs

No, Iexn not®

I almost did, but I'm

note Justice Marshall®
QUESTION:

If there had been no regulation, would

there have been a violation of due process?
MR0 BHOSNAHAN:
QUESTION t

No regulation0

MR0 BROSNAHANs
QUESTIONj

I would say no8

You would say no?

MRS BROSNAHAN3
QUESTION s

If there had been no regulation?

I would say no8

There was

some cf the language in your

brief? which I perhaps misunderstood? led me to believe that
you thought there may be a constitutional duty on the
Executive Branch to adopt a regulatioii of 'this character»
MR» BROSNAHAN2

We have two points? Justice Powell0

You've just referred to one»

Our major point? if I may say so

is that tills is a violation of due process under the Fifth
Amendment and should be suppressed®
A second point? fcha one you just referred to? is
that really in cases like Martinez°Fuerfee? for instance? it
was only the existence of regulations that saved that? at
least by our reading of the. opinion® And so we say that there
is some constitutional obligation to have regulations in
certain areas? but that is a separate argument on our part?
and that we do not have to pravail on that argument to succeed
May I just say on the question of suppression? the
government will not . jsfcop enacting regulations if this Court
holds that the regulations must be followed»

In the Jacobs

ease? while this Court heard argument of that very nature? the

48
Attorney General took those regulations and made them nation™
Hide* The regulations in Leahsy and Heffner are still in
■place a
There is no reason to believe that conscientious
federal officials will suddenly hold that they are not bound
©r they don’t have to pass regulations.

And finally a question

of good faith versus bad faith or? as I prefer to choose to
call it? deliberate violation of the regulation? Agent Hill
knew in March of 1974? in the record on page 24? that a
personal electronic surveillance of ray client was contemplated?
and yet in early 1975? when they did it? they didn’t have the
authorization from the Attorney General’s office.

We say

that’s deliberate.
QUESTION3

Mr. Brosnahan? if I understand your

brief? you’d make the same argument even if it were not
deliberate.

Just that there's a regulation for the benefit of

people like your client that was violated.

Isn’t that the

whole argument?
MR. BROSNAHANs

Well? X think our eas© might not be

as strong.
QUESTION:

I don’t understand why not.

What differ^*

©ne@ does it make whether it’s deliberate or not? if you’ve
get the regulation? you get it violated?
MR. BRQSNAHANs Well? our main position is that it
makes no difference. The government has strenuously argued that

49
we should look at the intent of the agents to solve the problem»
And, as a reaction to that,, we have said that tills is deliberate»
QUESTIONS

I see.

MR» BROSNAHAN:

I see»

This is deliberate»

And it was

deliberate — and this is a finding of fact in the district
court? tiie court found no explanation for the ten-month
hiatus»

The Ninth Circuit felt the same way, and I see that

my time has expired»
Thank you»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr» Brosnahan»

Do you have anything further, Mr» Cellar?
MR» GELLERs

Not unless the Court has any questions,

Mr» Chief Justice»
QUESTIONS

May I just ask one, Mr» Geller?

Would it make any difference to the government's
position if this were a statute rather than a regulation?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» GELLERs

It would make a difference in the sense

(a| the statute might itself have an exclusionary rule such
as that «*»
QUESTIONt

Well, let's take 3.109, the Chief Justice

suggested earlier, the announcement of presence before you
execute a search warrant»
MR» GELLERs

The Court has the power, in construing a

50
statute., to impose an exclusionary remedy in order to carry out
the will of Congress®
QUESTIONs

Is that what you regard Miller v® United

States as having done?
MR® GELLERs

Yes®

QUESTION;:

Well, the Court has the power to do the

same thing with respect to regulation®
MR® GELLERs
QUESTIONS

I think not* because ~
The chief one is a matter of powcsr «°"

you think not?
MR® GELLERs

*»“ in this case the Court

I think

not, because in one case you're dealing with the law, in
another case you're not dealing with something that's *»~
QUESTIONS But lay question goes to power®
MR® GELLERs

I think that the Court, this Court

obviously has the power to construe a statute and —
QUESTIONS

1 mean, until Weeks v® United States,

in 1914, there was no exclusionary rule®
MR® GELLERs

That's correct, but the Court was

construing the Constitution there®

We don't contest that the

Court ““
QUESTIONS

No, it wasn't in Weeks, it doesn't say

anything about the Constitution — it just says it was
enforcing the Constitution®
MR® GELLERs

Exactly® We think it's up to the agency

51
which has

created and defined the legal standard to be applied

when it promulgates a regulation9 to determine how that
regulation is -»QUESTION;

Well, that’s your argument.

MR. GELLERs Exactly.
QUESTION;

But certainly you’re assuming the

answer to this case if you say there’s no power on the part
of the Court to uphold an exclusionary rule. After all, the
Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit did precisely that.
MR. GELLERs We think incorrectly. We think the Court
has to find that it's only «=■”
QUESTIONs

Maybe it's incorrect, but certainly it

had th© power to do it.
MR. GELLERs

Well —

QUESTIONs Well, Mr. Geller, would you say the
Attorney General has the power to impose on the Court the duty
to exclude evidence just by including that *»- a provision
like that in his regulation?
MR. GELLERs
QUESTION:

No, no.
In this particular regulation, suppose

there had been an exclusionary provision?
MR. GELLERs

I think that —

QUESTION: Would the Court have to follow it?
MR. GELLERs

No, it wouldn’t.

I think it would like

in the petit situation in which the United States Government

52
mows for dismissal, but it's obviously up to the Court, to
decide whether to grant such a motion»
QUESTION ?

Right»

QUESTIONS

You don't buy the 800-pound gorilla theory

of this Court's power„ then»
[Laughter»]
MR» GELLER?
QUESTION?

I certainly — am sure I don't»
Let me ask the power question another way»

Supposing the regulation had a paragraph that said that any
evidence obtained in violation of this regulation shall not
be admissible in any court in the United States in any
proceeding for any purpose» Would that deprive a State judge
of the right to hear such evidence if it had it?
QUESTION?

No»

MR® GELLEKs

I still think it would be up to the

United States to determine whether to seek enforcement of that
provision of its own «—
QUESTION?

No, l*m assuming the United States

doesn't take the position one way or another, just two civil
litigants happen upon this evidence»

Would such a regulation

deprive a State court of the power to receive such evidence?
MR» GELLER?

I think not»

It's still not —— the

regulation is not law, it's merely an internal guideline for
whatever agency has promulgated it»
I think the court would have to find it's either

53
been a constitutional or statutory violation before it could
exclude 'the evidence»
QUESTION s

Mr» Gsllerj. of course

Luna v»

States was not a constitutional decision, was it?
MR» GELLER:

Section 3109»

QUESTIONS

Just 3109 --

MR» GELLERs
QUESTIONS

Yes,
*»“ and where did —» 3109 said nothing

about suppression, did it?
MR» GELLER:
QUESTION:

No, it doesn't, but wa don't ~
Wall, I know»

MR» GELLER:

It did not, did it?

It did not» We don't ——

QUESTION: But this Court directed the suppression,
didn't it?
MR» GELLER: We think the Court obviously has the
power in construing and enforcing the federal statute, just
like the Constitution, to order suppression if that's the ^Xy
appropriate remedy»
QUESTION:

But not in construing and enforcing a

regulation of the Attorney General, does it?
MR® GELLER:

That’s correct»
