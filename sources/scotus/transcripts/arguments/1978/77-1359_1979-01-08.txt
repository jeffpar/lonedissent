MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-1359, United States against Kimbell Foods.
Mr. Barnett* you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN Rc BARNETT* ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
The question In this case is whether a private lien
that has not become specific and definite* that has not become
choate before a federal lien attaches to the same property* takes
precedence over that federal lien.
QUESTION:

Do I get it* Mr. Barnett* specific and

definite is simply synonymous with choate?
MR. BARNETT:

Well* I use the words* Mr. Justice

Brennan* so as not to rely completely on the technical term
developed by this Court* but for functional purposes* I think
choate is the word* for better or worse.
QUESTION:

Does this mean that the claim must be

reduced to judgment?
MR. BARNETT:
that position.

No* Mr. Justice Powell* we do not take

The Crest Finance case* which we distinguish

here* made clear that when the amount of a lien is evidenced
by notes* notes bearing face values* that lien is choate as
the Government conceded and as the court held in that case* even

4
though it was not reduced to judgment.

Thus, if the future

advances that Kimbell made in this case, the future advances
had been evidenced by notes as were the inventory advances that
Kimbell made in 1966 and 1968, this would then be a different
case and Kimbell then would have a choate lien with respect to
those future advances.
evidenced by notes.

But the future advances here were not

The lien does not have to be reduced to

judgment when it is this kind of a lien, but there is a signlficant, a crucial difference between having a debt evidenced by
notes and having it simply be an open account where the amount
is indicated perhaps in one amount on the seller's books and in
another amount on the purchaser's

books, where there are all

sorts of uncertainties and possible defenses with respect to
the amount that are not ironed out until there is a judgment„
QUESTION:

Mr, Barnett, would it be an equally ap­

propriate phrasing of the question to say that this is a case
where the Government requests that this Court extend the choateness doctrine that has previously applied in tax areas to non­
tax activities of the Federal Government to give It priority
there?
MR0 BARNETT:

To reply, I would accept your statement,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, except for the last phrase, to apply In
those cases the same rules of first in time and choateneas,
to give the Government priority, therefore, when it prevails
under those rules, and to give the other party priority when it

5
prevails under those rules.
QUESTION:

Do you think the Fifth Circuit decision in

this case was a violation of the 'Ifirsfc in time* first in right"
rule?
MRa BARNETT:
QUESTION:

In this case?

Yes „

MR. BARNETT:

Not a direct violation# but this Court

has made clear in its decisions that there is a violation of
this Court's interpretation of the "first in time# first in
right" rule# as embodying the choateness approach to determining
when a lien arises.
QUESTION:

But that has previously been applied by

this Court only in the tax area# is that correct?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

That is true.

So you are asking us to extend it in this

case from the tax area to the fiaid of commercial lending by
the Government?
MRo BARNETT:

That is correcte

And# as we point out# commercial lending is an
activity of the Federal Government.

The SBA is not# as the

court; below said and as Respondent says# simply another commer­
cial lender.

The SBA makes loans for matters of policy# not

simply to make a profit.

The SBA operates under a statute

which provides that it shall make loans ^15 U.S.C. 636(a) (lj/
to small business concerns where financial assistance is not

6
otherwise available on reasonable terms from non-Federal
s ourc es.
In the record of this case, on the 3BA' lean guarantee
application at A-73, that policy la stated as the first of the
SBA's loan policies, quote, "The SBA will not extend financial
assistance if the funds are otherwise available on reasonable
terms from normal lending sources or the personal resources of
the principals."
QUESTION:
cut?

Mr. Barnett, what way does that argument

What you are saying, I suppose, is:

the Government is

willing to take 'greater risks in lending than private lenders
do, so why should It then need greater protection than private
lenders?

MR. BARNETT:

Well, it takes greater risk®, but it

needs protection that is consonant with those risks.
This Court, in the area/of tax liens, decided, bringing
the rule over from the insolvency statute, that the Government
needed the kind of protection reflected in the "first in time,
!

first in right" rule as adumbrated by the choateness principle.
We submit that,unless Congress says otherwise, it is approprlat^
to give the Government the same protection here.

A dollar

coming in on recovery of an SBA lien is the same to the
Government as a dollar collected on taxes.

In fact, Congress

replenishes the amount that the SBA loses.
This is not in the record, but Congress has in every

7
year since the establishment of the SBA* as I understand it,
appropriated at least enough to cover the amount that the SBA
lost.
So that* if the SBA does not recover on its security
and it does in fact take security for virtually all its loans*
Congress ends up appropriating the money.
QUESTION:

Yes* but it takes security that would not

be sufficient to induce a commercial lender to advance the
funds* doesn't it?

It starts from the premise that it is

willing to take some additional risks.
MR. BARNETT:

That is true.

And the question here is

you are correct — to what extent that would justify imposing
on the Government* this Court imposing on the Government*
when Congress has not done so* risks greater than had been
imposed on the Government in the context of Federal tax liens.
QUESTION:

The rule* I suppose* would be that it has

to fdllow the same precautionary procedures any other lender
has to follow.

It has to search the title and if it had

searched here it would have found there was a protected lien.
MR. BARNETT:

That is the rule that is contended for

here* but the rule that has previously been established with
respect to interest of the Federal Government by this Court =QUESTION:

Yes* but the difference there* as I under­

stand it* is that the Government has no way of protecting itself
in the tax case.

He doesn't know who is going to fail to pay

8
his taxes.

But here* before they advance the money* they can

go out and make a title search like any other lender can.

And

why shouldn’t they have that obligation?
MR» BARNETT:
for one thing.

Well* because Congress has not said so,

The rule that has been laid down in the tax lien

area has been followed by the Courts of Appeals and was unani­
mously followed by -QUESTION:

But you-just'told Justice Kehnqulsfc you

are asking us to extend that rule to -MR0 BARNETT:

I am asking this Court to extend it

since this Court has not done so, but the Courts of Appeals
found no difficulty at all in concluding that the reasons this
Court had given for the rule in the tax lien context were
equally applicable to contractual reasons.
QUESTION:

I just suggest to you they are not equally

applicable, because in one case the Government can check titles
and in the other case it can't»

Isn't that a justification for

a rather different approach to the problem?
MR0 BARNETT:

It may be»

It was not one of the rules

this Court gave for its doctrine in the tax lien area.
QUESTION:

Doesn't the Government expect to lose some

money on its SBA loans?
MR0 BARNETT:
4# in the latest year.

Indeed it does»

It loses approximately

The question is whether it should lose

more because of a rule adopted by this Court, or whether Congress

9
should make that decision.
QUESTION:

Or whether this Court should confine the

rule to the tax area where it now is,and let Congress determine
whether it should be extended further.
MR» BARNETT:

On what basis would Congress start?

This Court has to make some Federal law today*

Does it apply

the previous rule., or does it reach out and apply, for example,
the state law or the UCC or one of the concoctions of the
Fifth Circuit and then tall Congress to go from there?
QUESTION:

Does the Government, in theory, at least

as far as the statutes are concerned, expect to collect all its
taxes?
MR. BARNETT:-

Expect to collect all its taxes?

I am

sure,as a matter of practical prediction, it doesn't expect to*
QUESTION:

It knows that some taxpayers are going to

be bankrupt, for example.
MRo BARNETT:
QUESTION:

True.

And some are going to evade and naver be

caught.
MR* BARNETT:

Right.

And, despite that, this Court, by

laying down certain rules prior to the Tax Lien Act in 1966,
gave the Government a certain measure of protection.

Now,

Congress in that Act limited the protection in certain very
specific ways.
Our position here is that the Government, with respect

10

to its contractual liens, should be accorded the same traditional
protection, and lx" Congress wants to specifically limit that,
Congress is the body that should do it»

And it is quite signifi­

cant, we contend, that when Congress did act in the Tax Lien
Act in 1966, it dealt specifically with the question of liens
for future advances, which is involved here.
very limited protection to those liens„

And it gave only

It provided that a lien

for future advances is protected only if the advances are made
-- that is, is given priority —
QUESTION:

Couldn't Congress do the same thing in this

area?
MR0 BARNETT:

Well, they could precisely, but what

the court below has done, and what Respondent urges this Court
to do, is something very different, something that would give
much less protection to the Federal lien than Congress decided
to give to the Federal tax liens in the 1966 Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, along with what my brother,

Stevens, was talking about, you don't want us -- You say that
the SBA loses a lot of money.

You don't want us to encourage

them to lose more,do you?
MR„ BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Exactly not.

Well, wouldn't we be doing that if we

tell them don't use normal care by checking them, by checking
to see if there is a lien outstanding?
MR. BARNETT;

I don't think the Court would be telling

11

them not to use normal care.

The SBA does check0

is, what rules it must check under*

The question

In this case, if it had

checked it might well have decided to make the loan anyway.
Indeed, it was aware of ~QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, if it had checked, it would

have required that the other lien be waived in order -- It's
a pretty obvious thing for the lender to do, isn't it?
MR. BARNETT:
demand.

It is equally possible that Kimball would have refused.
QUESTION:

don't you think?
indebtedness.
ing lien.

It might have made that request or

Oh, that's highly unlikely on these facts,

They were going to pay off the outstanding

They could have easily said cancel your outstand­

I think it is really very unrealistic to assume they

wouldn't have been able to clean it up.
MK0 BARNETT:

And then Kimbell would have continued

to make loans on the same basis?
QUESTION:

I don't --

Or asked for additional security, just

like any outstanding balance.
MR. BARNETT:

I think that's highly unrealistic.

But Kimbell here might well have,

conceivably might have said, "If you pay us off, we will release
our collateral."

But Kimbell here was also demanding that it

keep its collateral with respect to the future advances.
QUESTION:
talk about it.

When you say "demand ing, " they just didn't

As I understand that footnote in the opinion,

they didn't really have a very sophisticated understanding of

12

what was going on,
MR, BARNETT:

But there is no reason to assume that

Klmbeil would have agreed to make future advances without
keeping some collateral for that.
QUESTION:

Perhaps not.

But the Government surely

could have said* "If we are going to give you $300*000, we want
to use $20*000 to pay off the existing indebtedness," which
they did* "and we also want you to terminate that protected
lien."
I'm sure that would have happened.
MR. BARNETT:

But maybe if the borroxver -- Okay* we

are not assured of being able to purchase future inventory on
credit
QUESTION:

So we are going to turn down the $300*000

because we may need to borrow $5*000 in the future?

That's

very unrealistic too* isn't it?
MR0 BARNETT:

Well* I concede that the SBA here could

have demanded of Klmbeil that it release its collateral.

It is

not entirely clear to me* and certainly there would be cases
in which it vjould not be clear* that the prior lender would be
willing to release collateral.

So it is not simply a question

of making the SBA be more careful* but of protecting some of
the loans* the admittedly risky loans, that the SBA does make*
because that’s its business* to make risky loans.

And the

question here is the measure of protection that the SBA will

13
have# and whether that measure is to be reduced as the Court of
Appeals rule here would reduce it, to a much greater extent
than Congress in the Tax Lien Act reduced the protection of
Federal tax liens.
Indeed, we find it ironic that the reason why the
choateness rule is said here to be no longer worth following,
the reason why two Circuits, the Fifth and Ninth, have abandoned
it, is said to be the Tax Lien Act of 1966 which modified it in
the area of tax liens.

But yet, the very rule that that Act

adopted for future advances which are involved here, is much
more protective of the Government's interests than the rule
that is proposed here.
QUESTION:

But the rule you want, Mr. Barnett, that

you defend, certainly gives the Government irore protection than
the Tax Lien Act.

MRo BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does, and Congress is ~~

Considerably more.

Not only -- right

across the board, except with respect to future advances.

MR. BARNETT:

That is true, Mr. Justice White, and

Congress is fully able to ~
QUESTION:

May I ask you another question.

If a

private lender had made this same loan that the SBA did, in the
face of an inventory financing schema, how would the private
lender have come out on these facts, under the Uniform Commer­
cial Code?

14

MR, BARNETT:

On these facts* the private lender would

have lost* would have had his lien subordinated —
QUESTION:

Under the Uniform Commercial Code* a per­

fected inventory arrangement calling for future advances, would
take precedence over a later perfected mortgage.
MRo BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Over an intervening perfected mortgage.

Over a later perfected mortgage.

MR, BARNETT:

Later to the initial agreement* prior

to the advance —
QUESTION:

Yes.

And so that the private lender* if

he had lent under these conditions here* would have been on
notice that there would be future advances* and he would take
subordinate to them.
MR. BARNETT:

Would have been on notice that there

could be future advances.

These were optional* but yes would

have taken subordinate to those future advances that they would
have made.

That is correct.
QUESTION:

state law?

Is that the rule in all the states* under

Or is it in forty-nine states* or what?
MR. BARNETT:

That raises the question of how uniform

is the Uniform Commercial Code.
Court here held.

It is the rule In Texas* the

It is fairly clearly the rule under the 1972

Amendments to the Uniform Commercial Code.

But* as I understand

it* those amendments have been adopted by only some twenty-one
states* to date.

So* it is not at all clear that that is the

15

rule in the forty-nine states that have adopted -QUESTION:

I suppose if the question is -- Of course#

Federal law applies here.

The question Is from what sources do

you draw the Federal law# I suppose.
You are saying just take the Tax Lien Law and apply
it.

But you don't want the Tax Lien Law# because that's now

been replaced by a statute.
MR. BARNETT:

No# no.

We are saying take the

common law principles that this Court developed on the basis#
first# of the insolvency statute# and then of the Tax Lien Law.
The Court of Appeals =*=
QUESTION:

Galling it common law# doesn't give it any

greater or less substance than just saying it is a Federal rule
that was crafted in this Court.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

That's true.

So# the question is now in the ordinary

commercial settings# from what source should a rule be drawn?
MR, BARNETT:

That's true.

The Court of Appeals

didn't decide -QUESTION:

Should be brought by comparison with some

area that Congress has already discarded?

I mean the rule -=■

that we — for tax liens# Congress has already put aside.
..'.MR. BARNETT:

We don't agree with that characteriza­

tion of It.
QUESTION:

Why don't you?

What is it that Congress —

16

MR, BARNETT:

Congress has modified it and limited it.

There are. Indeed, as the °»
QUESTION:

So, you now look to the statute, not to

our cases to say —
MR. BARNETT:

Not in all cases.

There are certain

lacunae in the statute, as the Second Circuit pointed out in
the MacArthur Village case, that might still be governed by
this Court's previous decisions.
But Congress, against the background of this Court's
previous decisions of the choafceness rule and the first in time
rule, crafted limited exceptions in the statute.
The question here is whether the Court should take a
quite different approach and adopt the UCC as the governing
Federal rule in this case.
QUESTION:

That is the choice.

MR. BARNETT:

That's the choice, although it is not

the choice the Court of Appeals chose.
QUESTION:

I would disagree, apparently, both with

my brother, White, and you, Mr, Barnett.

I would think the

Court of Appeals' opinion can be justified on the basis of
following the law of Texas.
MR, BARNETT:
QUESTION:

But the law of Texas is the UCC.

Right, but it would follow not because the

UCC was in existence in forty-nine states, but because this
particular Federal question of lien priority should be

17

determined by reference to state law.
QUESTION:

It is a Federal rule,

QUESTION:

It is a Federal rule# but it can be a

reference to state law rather than to UCC.
MRo BARNETT:

The reason why that is not a good idea#

we would submit# is because state law is variant# and the very
reason why this Court decided in Clearfield Trust that the
choice of law questioned here was a Federal question in the
first place.

It was primarily the need for uniformity.

The

Court has since emphasized that in the Lake Mis ere case and in
Miami v. Volusia County.
QUESTION:

And we have the Yazell case on the other

side of the scale.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And Householtf Finance»

MR. BARNETT:

But a rule that simply incorporated the

law of various states with respect to this question# which is
very much a question of the nationwide operation of the program
and which is rather close to questions of commercial paper#
would undermine the purpose of uniformity.
QUESTION:

Wasn't the Yazell case an SBA case?

MR. BARNETT:

I think it was.

Also# it would undermine here# we -would submit#
another reason for the application of Federal law in the first
place# which is the principle of Federal supremacy# if you will#

18

recognized by this Court In the Mew Britain case# that Federal
property interests should not be subjected to the sway of state
law.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett# are you familiar with the

position the Government took in the argument of Butner in the
case arising out of the second mortgage situation In North
Carolina?

The question is whether in determining whether the

second mortagee has to reduce the property to possession#
whether this should be governed by a Federal rule or by refer­
ence to state law.

And the United States in that case# where

it is a creditor# argued that the reference should be the stats
law# the Federal rule should be that we refer the matter to state
law.
I am just wondering if there is any basic difference
between the two kinds of situations in connection with the need
for uniformity?
MR. BARNETT:
case# so I can’t

I am sorry I am not familiar with that

say.

Even with respect to the UCC# when it is argued here
that the UCC should be adopted# there are various kinds of un­
certainties that that would create# which I think the Court
should be aware of.

For example# in addition to the fact that

the UCC rules may vary very considerably in different states#
there Is the question of what would be the scope of this asserted
adoption of the UCC?

For example# the Court of Appeals her®

19

said we are adopting the UGC with respect to when the state lien
arises.

We are not adopting it* at least not yet, with respect

to the relation-back question.

And we leave for another day the

question of whether we would apply the UCC in cases of other
kinds of liens, mechanic

'&

liens, repairman's liens, which the

Court said raise entirely different questions.
Well, if the UCC is to be embraced by this Court as
the governing code of Federal law in these cases, where does the
embrace stop?

Does it or does it not include those repairman's

liens and mechanic’s liens and state tax liens, and the questions
that they raise?
Respondent would apparently say that this Court should
limit the embrace to the consentual liens, which arise under the
UCC.
On what basis would that limit be established?

Would

this Court be telling the other Federal courts that they cannot
use the UCC with respect to those other liens? That they must,
or what?
There would be considerable uncertainties enge tiered,
which are illustrated, of course, by the Crittenden case, which
I will have occasion to discuss in greater detail later.
QUESTION:

Aren't they greater there than in this

case because in Crittenden, as I understand the Fifth Circuit's
opinion, we don't know what the Georgia law was.

But here, I

thought Judge Gee was quite clear as to what the Law of Texas was.

20

MR, BARNETT:

Bufc even if we knew what the Georgia

law was* the proposal might be to adopt the UCC* even if the
Georgia law is different.
QUESTION:

I certainly don't read the Fifth Circuit's

opinion* in this case* as saying that in Kimbell Foods.
MR. BARNETT:

With respect to when the state lien arises

I read the opinion as saying* "We will follow UCC principles on
tha t."
It happens that Texas here had adopted the UCC* but
I find nothing in this case to indicate that the Fifth Circuit
Is saying* "We will follow state law if that law happens to
diverge from the UCC."
While I agree* Mr. Justice Rehnquist* that the
problems in Crittenden are more complicated* my point is*
where would adoption of the UCC stop?
all sorts of such problems?
varies from state law?
QUESTION:

Would it not engender

Which to adopt where the UCC

To what extent to follox* the UCC?

In that respect* if you just followed the

law of each state* at least you might have some common under­
standing in the state what the rule was.
MR. BARNETT:

You would have in the state* but you

would have a complete overturning of the principle of uniformity.
QUESTION:

What principle is that?

That's the

question in this case -- one of the questions in this case -whether to have a uniform rule* and why shouldn't the SBA* in

21

operating in the various states as a lender* act like any other
lender?

Why should somebody — a bank -- furnishing inventory

financing have to say* "VJell* I guess we are good against every
kind of a lender except the Federal Government or the SBA "?
MR. BARNETT:
for one thing.

Well* because Congress has not said so*

That precise approach was opposed —

QUESTION:

I know* that's bootstrapping.

You just

don't know -MR. BARNETT:

That precise approach was made to

Congress in the drafting of the 1966 Tax Lien Act* as cited in
our brief here.

It was proposed that Federal tax liens —

QUESTION:

That's taxes.

MR. BARNETT:

That's a distinctive area.

Well* is it or isn't it?

That's the

case here.
QUESTION:

Suppose it isn't.

MR. BARNETT:

Well* then* we would cite the need for

uniformity In which this Court relied
QUESTION:

What need is that?

I don't understand

that need.
MR. BARNETT:

Well* need is that a Federal Agency

operating a nationwide program has to have some ability to rely
on nationwide standards.

No* it uses similar forms.

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

You are saying that there is a need, not

that the Government is sovereign but it needs because of some
peculiar difficulties of operating in all fifty states.

that that is a reason for applying Federal law in —
QUESTION:

Not yet* not yet.

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

In Clearfield Trust —

Not yet* in this commercial area.

MR. BARNETT:

True* but in Clearfield Trust the

proposition was that the need for uniformity is the reason for
making it a question of Federal law* in the first place* in
a commercial area such as this.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Teofan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VERNON 0. TEOFAN* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. TEOFAN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
While it may not have seemed readily apparent from
the Government's abbreviated statement of the issue presented
in this case* this isn't simply a case of a choafee Federal lien

23

versus an Inchoate private lien.

This case Is entirely differ­

ent from any of the cases on which the Government relies.

The

two competing liens that you had in this case were both created
and perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of
Texas in favor of private lenders.
lien from the inception.
of Kimbell Foods.

This wasn't a Government

The first lien was created in favor

It was perfected in 1966 and 1968» long be­

fore the second party# the Republic National Bank# acquired its
security interest# much less had it perfected# and at least two
years prior to the time that the SBA purchased an individed
90$ interest.
QUESTION:

Are you arguing# Mr. Teofan# that if. Texas

was the only state that had this code and the other forty-nine
states had a different uniform code# the case would be the
same?
MR. TEQFAN:

Yes# based on United States v. Vermont.

What the SBA is arguing in this case is that in 1961#
five years after Kimbell perfected its lien# when it purchased

■

its 90$ Interest in the Republic National Bank , security interest#
that invested that Republic National Bank security interest with
Federal lien rights and sovereign prerogatives# which relayed it
all the way back to when the lien was first taken by the

The Fifth Circuit rejected that logic and refused to
extend the choate lien test into this kind of situation»
Now* when I was reviewing this Court's opinions in
United States v. City of New Britain and United States v, Ver­
mont^ 1 realized that I had missed a very basic point in brief­
ing this situation for Kimbell.
In United States v. the City of New Britain* in that
case* you have competing local water rent lands and local tax
lands competing with the Federal tax lands.

The Court there

laid down the basic rule that in determining what is first in
time and* therefore* first In right* you must determine which
lien attached first and which lien became choate.

It didn't

say that test only applied to the private lien and not to
Government lien.
So* then* you come to United States v, Vermont* a
unanimous decision by this Court* the opinion written by
Mr, Justice Stewart,

In that case* the two liens you had
I

competing with each other were a Federal tax lien and a
Vermont tax lien which arose under a statute that was pat­
terned after the Federal tax lien and whose wording was iden­
tical.
The Vermont tax lien had been assessed first., ths
Federal lien some months later.

The Government* in that case*

argued that the Vermont Her was inchoate and urged that a dif­
ferent standard of choateness be applied to the state lien than

25

to the Government lien»

This Court rejected that.

Both liens

arose under identical statutes* and this Court held the Vermont
lien first in time and prior in right.
The basis of the Vermont case, essentially* is this.
When you have two competing liens which arise under the same
statute* such as we have here* or substantially identical
statutes* the reasonable rule is to look to the statute for
priority* and that's uniform.

. v

I submit that this Court can dispose of this case in
favor of Kimbell just by reiterating that the Federal common
law rule is that where the liens arise under the same statute*
or under substantially identical statutes* you look to the
statute for priority.

That's uniform* that's non-discriminatory

and unquestionably just.
That point is not specifically covered in the brief
and neither is the point vjifch relation to some subsequent
Congressional action.
QUESTION:
MRc TEOFAN:
QUESTION:

After the brief -Poes the SBA make the direct loan?
Yes.
And under what lav? do you suppose the lien

arises when it makes a direct loan?
MR. TEOFAN:

The basic proposition — We have no

quarrel with it -- is that it is Federal law that governs.

But

when the SBA enters into a field of consentual loans it should
be governed by the same law as all the rest of us.

Are they expected to

Congress has admonished the SBA to make only

loans of such sound value, or so secured as to reasonably assure
repayment.
As pointed out by this Court in Yazell, SBA activity
is very localized.

It is done by local offices and by agents

who are experienced in the law of those localities.
Just before lunch, I want to point out one other
piece of legislation.

The Fifth Circuit, in refusing to extend

the choateness rule of this area, looked to a recent act of
Congress as a barometer of what was going on in the commercial
world, and also what Federal intent was with relation to Federal
priority.

And it referred to the Tax Lien Act of 1966, which

abolished a lot of the priorities established by the choateness
rule.

28
Well» after the briefs were filed in this case, in
November of last year, there was enacted the new Bankruptcy Act
which goes into effect, for the most part, in October of 1978.
In that Bankruptcy Act, Congress has done away completely with
all Federal priority, except for taxes accruing within three
years of the filing of the petition.
The old subsection 64(a)(5), giving the Federal
Government priority for non-tax debts, has been abolished.
QUESTION:

But that doesn't have retroactive effect

in this case.
MR. TEOFAN:

No, sir, this is not a bankruptcy case.

I refer to that merely as an indicator of governmental policy
on Federal priority status.
QUESTION:

That doesn't get to how Government priority

is to be established.

It didn't do away with priority, for

example, that the Government would have under a perfected lien
in bankruptcy, did it?

And it didn't answer how — to what law

would you look to determine whether the lien is perfected.
MR. TEOFAN:

No, it does not answer those questions.

I just referred to it as an indicator that the super priority
which has been furnished to the Government in previous cases
has been done away with and does not carry the same
that it did previously.
I will resume after lunch.
Thank you.

it somewhere and I knew that they did.

I knew that I had seen
What I did finally re-*

member was that in U.S. v, Yazell* which is an SBA case arising
out of Texas* this Court in that case said there is no problem
in complying with state law; in fact* SBA transactions in each
state* specifically* and in great detail* adapted to state law
and it refers to Note 35.
Note 35 is the Financial Assistance Manual of the
Small Business Administration* SBA 500.

It is replete with

admonitions to follow state law carefully.

Thus* Section

401.03 reads, "Compliance with applicable law.

When the United

States disburses funds it is exercising a constitutional func­
tional power and its rights and duties are governed by Federal
rather than local law.

However* it is frequently necessary in

Accordingly, care should be used in following or

And then the footnote -QUESTION:

MR. TEOFAN:

That's exactly our position in this

case.
QUESTION:
says.

That's what the last paragraph on here

I know the hard way.
MRo TEOFAN:

Yes.

In their brief and in the argument, the Government
here strongly insists that there is a coherent,well-established,
well-understood body of precedent that would establish that the
choateness rule should be applied in this case, and therefore
urges this Court to not deviate from that rule but extend it
xnto this new field oi consentual security interest under the

32

Uniform Commercial Code.
First of all, such contention is not well taken.
There exists no such coherent well-established, well-understood
body of precedent.

This Court has never extended the choate

lien test rule outside the context of the Federal Insolvency
Statute or the Federal Tax Lien Act.

In both of those fields,

Congress has greatly reduced Federal priority.
This Court has never held in any case that the choate
lien test applies to a consentual security interest held or
acquired by the Government.

Neither this Court nor any lower

court has ever held the choateness test applicable In a case
involving a Federal consentual lien versus a private consentual
\

lien, a Federal security agreement interest under the Uniform
Commercial Code versus a private security interest under the
Uniform Commercial, Code.

j

There has been no extension of that

choate lien test into this area.

Consequently, there is no
\\

evil for the Government to correct by legislation.

This fielc'

has not been covered.
The five Circuit Court of Appeals cases relied on by
the Government,as establishing this precedent at the time the
transactions were entered into,all involve a competing statutory
special interest lien created by a state statute which either
grants that lien super priority or relates it back to a point in
time that has no reasonable connection with the establishment
of the lien.

We don’t have that in this case.

33
The choateness rule was developed primarily to prevent
the special interest lien creditors from getting a leg up on
the Government in the collecting of its taxes in the exercise
of a sovereign power.
Now, what the Government is trying to do in this case
is to take the choate lien test and relate it back and give the
Government a leg up on the private lender.
quired.

And it is not re­

What they are attempting to do is to perpetrate a re­

verse evil that the choateness rule was originally fashioned by
this Court to prevent.
Such coherent well-established body of precedent was
not even well-understood by the attorneys and the representatives
of the Government and the SBA at the beginning of this case.
In the Government's answer to Klmbell's complaint and in the
detailed pre-trial agreement that was filed with the court,
absolutely no mention whatsoever is made of choateness.

No

issue is reserved as to whether or not Klmbell's lien is choate.
i

During the trial of this case, counsel for the
Government stood up and announced to the trial court that its
position was the same as the Republic National Bank's.

The

primary line of defense

had nothing to do with choateness or

Federal super priority.

It was,one,Kimbell had either expressly

or impliedly agreed that its lien would be Inferior to the lien
*

■

vt-

o,f. .the Republic National Bank, or number two, that under appli­
cable state law, future advances were not covered under the

34
security agreement.

That was rejected by the Fifth Circuit as

not here before the Court.
It was not until after the case was actually tried
and briefs were submitted to the trial court that the issue of
choateness was' ever raised.

So, if it was such a well-established,

well-understood body of precedent, why did it appear in the case
so late?
I think the law review articles that have been
written by the authorities with relation to the choateness
rule demonstrate that It is not a clear body of law.

Even

counsel in this case is somewhat unclear as to what is or is
not a choate lien.

In the original brief, he took the position

that Kimbell's lien could not be choate because it was not re­
duced to judgment.
QUESTION:

Of course, you could say that about lots

of groups of decisions of this Court, couldn't you, in other
fields of the law?
MR. TEOFAN:
QUESTION:
MR. TEOFAN:

Say what. Your Honor?
That it isn’t all that clear.
What we are trying to do here is to

fashion a Federal rule that is a little bit clearer, at least
*

clearer and fairer than the choateness test.
QUESTION:

I notice you didn’t say "crafted," which

V

is the word that was used before.
MR. TEOFAN:

Even the Government doesn’t know when a

35
lien is choate.

They say there is a big difference between a

security interest that secures a debt owing on a promissory
note, which it now says may be choate because of its concession
made in the Crest Finance case, but that doesn't apply where the
debt is secured by an open account.

It says if you have got a

piece of paper that says it8s a promissory note, that's good,
it's choate.

If your pieces of paper are invoices submitted on

a weekly basis, plus statements of account, they say that is
no good, that's inchoate.
And why do they say that?

They say that because

there are many challenges that a creditor who purchases goods
on open account can make.

Therefore, there are many contingen­

cies and until it is reduced to judgment it can't be choate.
But that is sort of specious reasoning.

The same applies to a

promissory note.
In the Crest case, you hod a series of promissory
notes.

Payments had been made on those notes.

interest had accrued.
promissory note.

Additional

The debt secured was not the face of the

You had to go to the books and records of the

Government and you had to go to the books and records of the
finance company to determine what the balance outstanding was
on any given day.
And anybody who has tried a case on a promissory note
knows that ingenious counsel can come up with as many defenses
to a suit for the balance of a promissory note as he can for a

36
suit based on an account,,
So, if a suit -- We submit, Your Honor, that if a
security interest securing the balance on promissory notes is
not choate, so also should be held for the purpose of choateness
in this area if it applies, is the balance owing on an open
account,
At any given point in time, you can determine the
amount of the lien, the property to which it attaches, the name
of the secured party and the name of the debtor.
The other point,with relation to security interests
under the code, is that some of the cases that indicated that a
lien will be deemed choate

if it is enforceable by summary

proceedings.
It is to be noted under the Uniform Commercial Code
that upon default a security interest can be enforced by
summary proceedings.

The creditor goes out, picks up the
No judicial action is required.

The Government argues that what we really need to do
here is take the rule that will give us the stability and
certainty, so that people who are engaged in commercial lending
will know where they stand.

And they say that we can get that

I
way through the choate lien test.
We submit that is not correct.

If you take their

argument that a lien becomes -- that a private lien becomes a
Federal lien when it is acquired by the Government, and it

37
relates all the way back to when it was first created, and then
you apply the choateness test there, what you have is uncertainty
)

foretold.
First of all, the man who makes a loan for extending
credit,he will not know if the Government will ever come in
and guarantee a loan, Insure a loan, or buy somebody's loan,
or get a direct loan sometime in the future three or four years.
If the Government does come in and acquire a loan
some years in advance, then that creditor will not know to what
date that lien relates back, because there is absolutely nothing
that requires the recordation of a Government guarantee or a

I

Government security interest;even after the Government acquires
it, nothing need really be filed of record.

And as far as the

commercial community is concerned, there is absolutely no
notice to anybody that there may be a Federal lien floating out
there somewhere.
The other uncertainty, the third uncertainty, is to
what collateral will the Federal lien attach when it relates
back?

Property is sold, a lot of people have shipped in addi­

tional merchandise to the debtor, like Kimbell did in this case.
^

Kimbell's security interest is a purchased money security inter­
est.

It secures the payment price of merchandise which Kimbell

actually shipped in.

If the lien relates back prior to that

time and Kimbell's lien is no good, that's an uncertainty.
And the other uncertainty would be the amount of the

debt that would be secured at the time the Federal lien was
given effect.

The amounts balance.

$300,000* it could be down to $20.

If the loan was originally
If it were originally $300,

and it had future advances clauses, it could go up to $600.
Too much uncertainty would be created by applying the
choateness rule in this concept of consentual liens.

The per­

formance of a proprietary or commercial function by the Govern­
ment, as distinguished from sovereign function, such as col-lecting taxes.

You just wouldn't know where you stood.

Now, they make an argument in their brief that this
will not create any economic adverse effects on private loans
to small businesses.

Common sense and experience tell every

one of us that whether you are loaning money or.selling pro­
ducts, if a private lender sells to a specific portion of a
market and loses money, one of two things is going to happen.
He is either going to increase the cost of that service to the
customer or he is going to curtail doing business in that seg­
ment of the economy.
The Government has intimated that if this Court were
to adopt the priority rules that have been incorporated by
Congress in the Tax Lien Act of 1966, that Klmbell would lose
because the advances were made more than 45 days after the
Federal lien.

That argument is based on the premise that the

Federal lien was filed when it was originally filed in favor of
Republic National Bank.

We submit that at that time it was not a Federal

Why did it do that?

MR„ TEOFAN:

The reason you file those kinds of

things, Your Honor -QUESTION:

wonder why the SBA did.
MRo TEOFAN:

They may not have trusted Republic

National Bank, after their initial encounter in this case, and
didn't want Republic National Bank to be put in a position to
either release or prejudice that lien.
The reason you file a UCC-3 is to prevent the original
secured party from doing anything that would affect the assignee's
rights.

The UCC-3 doesn't creata any rights.

It is purely a

notice instrument.

MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
The statement from the SBA manual that my brother

quotes makes clear that the rights that were required in Yagell
-- makes clear that the rights of the SBA arise under Federal

QUESTION:

Is there anything In the SBA Act that says

precisely when a Federal lien arises?
MRo BARNETT:

The only thing in the SBA Act that

relates to liens is the section that we have quoted in our
brief and discussed* which provides that SBA liens are specific­
ally subordinated to state and local liens for property taxes.

QUESTION:

But there Is nothing in the SBA Act?

MR. BARNETT:

Nothing in the SBA Act, except that

specific provision which does subordinate SBA liens* but only
for a carefully tailored exception.
As you were pointing out* Mr. Justice White* the SBA
may not have to file under state law, but it does, and that is
the answer to my brother's contention that people may never
know when they are dealing with SBA.
QUESTION:
about uniformity.

But it is also an answer to your argument
They don't seem to put so much store in

uniformity if they instruct all their local people to be awfully
careful about state law.
MR. BARNETT:

Well, as a matter of convenience, and

as a matter of allowing other people to rely in the commercial
world, they do file, but it doesn't follow that their lien is
thereby created under state law.

And it doesn't follow that

state law should govern their priority rights.
QUESTION:

What if they didn't file?

MR. BARNETT:

That is not this case and we are not

here defending a situation in which the SBA lien has not been
filed.
QUESTION:

You are just talking about a practice,

though.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, that Is the practice.

But what if they didn't follow their

practice in a particular

case?

What about the other -- rights

of other people?
MR, BARNETT:

We would have -- I, at least, would

have difficulty defending that situation, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

concerned.
QUESTION: "In drafting service provisions, counsel
should carefully consider the applicable laws of the state."
That's what this regulation says.
MR. BARNETT:

True, but that does not imply that state

law governs the rights, as the earlier part of the regulation

says* "The state law governs the Government's rights."
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett* the second sentence of that

Footnote 35 from the Yazell case* which you just read from*
