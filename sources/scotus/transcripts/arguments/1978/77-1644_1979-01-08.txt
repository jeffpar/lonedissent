MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed, Mr.

Barnett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case, too, involves competing liens in a tractor.
The Federal Government at this time, through the Farmers Home
Administration of the Department of Argiculture, had a lien on
the tractor as security for loans it made to the farmer.

After

this lien had been established, the farmer took the tractor to
the Respondent for repairs, and the question is whether the
Respondent's statutory repairman's lien takes precedence over
the earlier Federal lien under principles of superpriority, or,
on the other hand, whether the Government's lien prevails under
the principle of "first in time, first in right".
The FHA makes loans pursuant to what is now the Con­
solidated Farm and Rural Development Act to farmers who are
"unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance their
actual needs at reasonable rates and terms."

Thus, like the

SBA, the FHA is engaged in lending not to make a profit, but to
serve a policy interest of the Federal Government.
The distinction that my brother in the former case
tried to make between sovereign and commercial functions of the

4
Government, we submit, is not a valid distinction, and this
Court made that clear in cases such as Indian Point.

When the

Government lends money through the FHA, it is performing a
governmental, a sovereign function, for reasons of policy.
QUESTION:

Indian Point is under the Federal Tort

Claims Act, isn't it?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes.

It is cited in our brief in

Kimbell.
Indeed, the provisions of the FHA policy is written
into the security agreement in this case, at appendix page 10,
where it expressly provides that if at any time it appears to
the FHA that the debtor can obtain a reasonable loan elsewhere
— that is, a loan on reasonable terms elsewhere — the debtor
will, at the FHA's request, apply for that loan and pay off the
FHA.
This was apparently quite a tractor in this case, be­
cause between November 1972 and July, 1973, the farmer brought
it in to Respondent for repairs a total of seven times.

In

each case Respondent made the repairs and returned the tractor
to the farmer, who did not pay his bill.

By July of 1973 the

amount of the bill was $1600.
When the Respondent brought the tractor in again for
the eighth time, in December, 1973, this time for repairs that
raised the account to $2,100, Respondent kept possession of the
tractor while awaiting payment.

5

When the tractor was finally sold in 1978 — inci­
dentally, it was sold for $1500, less than the repair bill, al­
though admittedly this was five years after the repairs had been
made.
QUESTION:

Are tractors like passenger automobiles?

Is there artivicial obsolescence?
MR. BARNETT:

I don't know, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I'm

not a farm boy.
QUESTION:

I'm not, either.

That's the reason I asked

the question.
MR. BARNETT:

While the Court of Appeals in Kimbell

Foods rejected the choateness rule for determining lien prior­
ities, the Court of Appeals in this case rejected the even more
fundamental rule of first in time, first in right, a rule that
goes back in this Court to the 1827 decision in Rankin v. Scott,
in which Chief Justice Marshall stated that the principle is
believed to be universal, that a prior lien gives a prior claim
which is entitled to prior satisfaction out of the subjected
funds.
QUESTION:

The Fifth Circuit also rejected the prin­

ciple that Federal law would refer to State lav? in this case,
didn't it?

Didn't it say we don't have to cite what Georgia

law is in this case because we're going to follow a general
common law UCC principle?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, it did, not quite a UCC principle.

6

The Court here took a rather hybrid approach.

It started with

the UCC, but the UCC in this case incorporates State law.

The

Court then looked to see what the Georgia law was, decided that
either Georgia law was unclear or it was unfavorable.

The Court

then looked back to the UCC, decided that it would adopt the
UCC provision, but without the part of the UCC provision that
says unless State law provides otherwise, and then finally the
Court picked up a piece of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 to
complete its collage.
QUESTION:

What if this Court were to decide that as

a matter of Federal law the reference would be to Georgia law
in this case?

Does the Government agree with Judge Elliott's

opinion that the District Court was right, or does the Govern­
ment think it should be sent back for consideration by the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as to what Georgia law is?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, we take the position that Georgia

law —- that tha District Court was wrong, that under Georgia law
there is no su^h superpriority here, but it's not a position we
rely on.

It's a question of State law.
But to answer the broader implications of your quest­

ion, Mr. Justice Renhquist, if the Court here were to take the
position that State law governs, we think there would be all
sorts of problems with that rule.
For one thing, I believe it would destroy the uniform­
ity which we insist that this Court has recognized, beginning

7
with the Clearfield Trust case.
The Court here recognised that.

The Fifth Circuit

here relied on Kimbell and its earlier Hext case.

The Fifth

Circuit, in stating that the Federal lav/ governs, stated the
principal reasons supporting the application of Federal law is
the need for a uniform rule of decision to govern the rights of
the United States in the administration of a large-scale program.
Now, that uniformity would be particularly destroyed
in a situation of this case, where the States are quite split on
the question of superpriority for repairman's liens.
As wa note in our brief on page 27, Note 24, there are
at least 13 states that have been held to have statutes which
deny the repairman the superpriority.
—- I'm sorry.

Those are 13 decided cases

To find the 13, the ALR connotation cited there

lists 1C, and our citations include three more.

Those are cases

that have held the States have such statutes, and there may be
other States that do.

Thus, there would be quite a divergency

in what the rule is under State law, and we submit this would
make it quite difficult for Federal agencies to administer their
programs.
Now, the Sell case, which has been cited in opposition
to this principle, was a case involving a State law of marital
property, and while the Court there followed that law, there
was a statement in the opinion saying that if the SBA regulations
were to the contrary, the result might be different.

The SBA

8

regulations now are to the contrary.

We submit that that case

is very var from the questions of commercial law as are involved
in this case.
In Little Lake Missouri as well, this Court pointed
out that the land acquisition there, although it was an acquis­
ition of land, the kind of thing traditionally governed by local
law, "is one arising from and bearing heavily on the Federal
regulatory programs.

The choice of law is therefore a Federal

decision."
In Myree v. Dekalb County, in applying State law, the
Court said- "The question here does not require a decision under
Federal common law since the litigation is among private parties
and no substantial rights or duties of the U.S. hinge on the
outcome."
Well, in this case/ the Substantial rights and duties
of the U.S. do hinge on the outcome.

The litigation is not be­

tween private parties, but the United States is involved.

We

submit that not only does Clearfield Trust apply but the prin­
ciple of unifo.tmity that is embodied in Clearfield Trust would
be inconsistent with borrowing or adopting State law as well.
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, I take it you think the SBA,

by regulation, could subordinate its lien to purchase money
mortgages and has —
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

It has.

And it —

And I take it that you think that by regul-

9
ation it could have come out with the other result on purchase
money mortgages?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think it could, by regulation.

And similarly here, it could if it wanted to

provide by regulation, that their liens would not be subordinate
to mechanics liens laws?
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

I think it could by regulation.

But it has been silent on that.

MR. 3ARNETT:

Yes, it has.

The specific security agreement here gives it the
specific authority to subordinate its lien if it wishes to in
this case.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you think by regulation the SBA

could protect itself?
MR. BARNETT:

I don't see why — Could protect itself?

Yes.
QUESTION:

From later-developing mechanics liens?

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Oh, no, no.

I'm sorry.

Well, say it has a lien on a piece of prop­

erty that the ]x>rrower sends to a mechanic, and he does some work
on it and says "pay the bill" and the owner says "I can't pay".
So he just holds it.
Mow, could the SBA provide that its existing lien never
theless is prior to the mechanics lien?
MR. BARNETT:

No, I don’t think so.

I misunderstood.

10

I thought you were asking whether they could subordinate its
lien by regulation.

In this case it tried to protect itself by

providing in the security agreement that the borrower may not
encumber the tractor without its permission.
I don't think the SBA could do that simply by regulat­
ion.
QUESTION;

Congress could, I suppose.

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION;

Congress could.

But you don't think under the statute the

SBA would have the authority to so provide by regulations.
Where did it get the authority to subordinate its
interest to purchase money mortgages?
MR. BARNETT;

I don't know.

statement, Mr. Justice White.

I will have to retract my

I simply don't know whether it

would have the authority under regulation to do that or not, to
protect itself, to enact a rule that we are saying here is the
rule of Federal common law.
QUESTION;

You mean the rule that this Court would

enact —
MR. BARNETT;
common law.

Yes, would recognize it's sort of a

I don't know.

I rather doubt —- I don't want to

say whether the SBA would have that authority under regulation.
QUESTION:

What if the FHA here had foreclosed so that

it stood in the shoes of the tractor owner, and the tractor was
being held by the repair people pursuant to the mechanic's lien,

and the only claim made was the amount owed for that particular
repair bill,, the eighth time.

Do you think the FHA could have

gotten a writ of replevin or something and force the tractor
repairman to surrender it?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes.

As I was saying, the "first in time" rule goes way back
in this Court and has been uniformly applied by this Court.

The

Second Circuit, for example, recognized that in the MacArthur
Senior Village case.
The Congress, in the Tax lien Act of 1966, did of
course make some exceptions to the rule in the case of Federal
tax liens.

But as the Second Circuit pointed out, those except­

ions were carefully tailored.

In particular, the Second Circuit

in the MacArthur Senior Village case noted one such exception,
in the Tax Lien Act, 26 USC 6323(b)(7), which applies to mech­
anics liens for the repair or improvement of a personal residence
containing not more than four dwelling units, occupied by the
owner of such residence, but only if the contract price is not
more than one-thousand dollars.
Now, if the decision of the Court of Appeals here were
upheld, the decision that relies in part on the Federal Tax Lien
Act, one may wonder among other things what the law would be with
respect to this particular kind of mechanics lien or any other
particular kind.

Would the Court here give superpriority to

that kind of lien, even though the Tax Lien Act would not?

Would

12
it give superpriority only up to the amount of a thousand dollars?
Would it incorporate the limit of only four dwelling units in
the residence?
This is, we submit, an example of the kind of uncer­
tainties that are created by the decision here.

And, we submit,

it wouldn't help to adopt any of the alternatives to the Court
of Appeals ad hoc eclecticism here, for the reasons I noted a
few moments ago in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
it would not help to adopt State law.

We submit

For one thing, State lav/

is very inconsistent on the precise question here.

For another

thing, uniformity is important, we think, and yet another thing,
the policy that State law should not be able to hold sway over
Federal property interests is involved.
Now, of course, it can be said that if this Court were
to adopt a rule of borrowing State law, the Court is, of course,
always free to examine a particular State law to determine whether
it is hostile to Federal interests or aberrant.
But we submit that would be a lot of ad hoc lawmaking
for this Court to do, and would involve supervision and criticism
of State laws in a very large area, the whole of commercial lav/,
which would be an approach inferior to that of adopting or ad­
hering to the clear Federal rule of "first in time, first in
right."

It is —
QUESTION:

agency regulation?

Unless that happened to be varied by an

13
MR. BARNETT;

Well, again, I don't know about .agency

regulation, but certainly it could be varied by Congress.
QUESTION:

Didn't the SBA regulation on purchase money

mortgages vary that?
MR. BARNETT:

It varied by subordinating its claim.

My

point is, I'm not sure that — yes, the agency regulation can
subordinate its claim.

I am not sure whether it can strengthen

or protect its claim.
The result reached by the Court of Appeals here is one
that no one could have predicted, and one, we submit, should not
be upheld, because it would create havoc with commercial trans­
actions.
Now, it may be suggested — it has been suggested —
that the model U.C.C. should be adopted instead, because it is
supposedly uniform, as State law isn't, on this question, and
because it would not be such a unique concoction as the Court
of Appeals reached here.

However, we submit that that altern­

ative would not be acceptable, either —
QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, I take it from what you said

a while ago — I just want to check it.

You said thirteen States

would permit the creditor lienor to replevin the property from
the mechanics lienholder?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, at least 13 States have statutes

that have been held to give priority to the earlier lienor against
the subsequent repairman.

I assume that would allow a replevin

14
as well as —•
QUESTION:

Without paying his bill?

MR. BARNETT:

Yes.

If the U.C.C. is looked to, one problem was that here—
and it is a problem that implicates the Kimbell case as well
is that the U.C.C. here itself refers to State law, so that if
State law is inconsistent, the resulting rule would be inconsistent
as well.
As I mentioned in the Kimbell argument, that, it seems
to us, is a problem with adopting the U.C.C. in the Kimbell sit­
uation.

How do you exclude the situation in mechanics liens

How would one know to what extent and with

adopted everywhere.

That is another respect in the U.C.C.,
It is not uniform.

It has not been

It has not been adopted in Louisiana at all.

The provisions of the original U.C.C., the 1962 vers­
ion, have themselves not been adopted everywhere, as illustrated
by Georgia's failure to adopt the provision in this case, and
amendments are not adopted immediately, if at all, and judicial
interpretations vary.

15
As the First Circuit pointed out in the Chicago Title
case, with respect to mechanics liens in particular, there are
many local eccentrreities.

We see no way in which those eccen­

tricities could fail to lead to confusion and uncertainty in the
situation in this case, and we see no way in which if the U.C.C.
were adopted in the Kimbell situation, those uncertainties would
not creep into the rule to create havoc in the general rule, and
we submit that it is for Congress to determine to what extent
Federal contractual liens and in what precise respects Federal
contractual liens should be subordinated to the U.C.C., to State
law, or anything else.
Aaain, we find it significant what Congress did in the
1966 Tax Lien Act, was to reject the proposal that it simply
adopt State law and place Federal tax liens on the same basis
as other liens under State law, but instead, adopted a carefullycrafted set of Federal rules for Federal tax liens.
QUESTION:

Do you need the transposition of choateness

from the tax insolvency field under the commercial loan field
in this case to win for you?
MR. BARNETT:

No, we don't in this case, because in

this case it's "first in time" by any definition.

We don't have

to rely cn the choateness rule in this case at all.
QUESTION:

Choateness really isn't an issue here.

lien simply didn't exist —
MR. BARNETT:

Exactly.

Whatever choateness means,

The

16

a lien is presumably inchoate when it does not yet exist.
QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

So what's really being challenged here is

the "first in time" rule?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, exactly.

Well, Respondent has made an equitable argument that
it is somehow unfair to the — unfair for the first lienor to
be given priority on the basis of "first in time, first in right",
that the repairman contributes value to the chattel and that it
is unfair to deprive him of a prior lien for that value.
We think there are several reasons why that argument
should not be accepted.

One is, it is significant that it has

not been, accepted in a number of States, at least thirteen.

The

equity that is so clear to Respondent is apparently not so clear
to the legislatures in those States.
In addition, it should be noted that in reality we are
not — the "first in time" rule does not mean the first lienor
has an unchangeable primacy.

It simply sets a starting point

from which the parties may deal, a clear starting point.

If it

is true that the value of the repairs would increase the value
of the chattel more than the price of the repairs, then it follows
that the first lienor would presumably consent to a release of
a portion of the collateral for the repairs.

And indeed, the

FHA, in the security agreement in this case, retains precisely
that option.

In the record at A-9, the security agreement on one

17
hand requires the debtor to care for and maintain the collateral
in a good and husbandlike manner, and it goes on to provide in
paragraph 3(f) that the FHA has the right to advance funds for
the preservation or protection of the collateral, with such
advances to be added to the amount of the note at the same rate
of interest.
So the question really is, who decides whether the
repair will increase the value of the chattel and is it a prov­
ident thing to do.

The first lienor, the FHA here, has tried

to maintain — to retain that right of decision, and we submit
that under the rule of "first in time" that right appropriately
belongs to the first lienor and that there is nothing inequitable
about that case.
The repairs may well be reasonable, but it's conceiv­
able, however, that they are not reasonable.

Without suggesting

they were unreasonable in this case, it might be pointed out that
we have more than two-thousand dollars worth of repairs on a
tractor that was eventually sold for only five thousand.

It is

conceivable theit the FHA, if asked, as it was entitled to be
asked, would have decided "No, it might be better for the farmer
to buy a new tractor."
QUESTION:

How much did the court below say the mechan­

ics lienor had a first lien for?
MR. BARNETT:
$500 worth of repairs -—

MR. BARNETT;

Well, one may wonder here why he went

up through $1500 and returned the tractor each time without doing
anything to see whether the farmer would ever be able to pay.
Indeed, that raises a question of the so-called practical problems
that Respondent cites, arguing that there is no way for a repair­
man to protect himself if the "first in time" -QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, how do you suggest we leave

the matter to Congress?

obviously leave it to Congress.

You just want us to decide it

followed since 1827,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hollis?

ORAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
ZAC A. CRITTENDEN, JR.
MR. HOLLIS;:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The broad impact of this case is reflected in the
amicus briefs that were filed both in this case and in the Kimhell
case, but the impact is broader than that because the individuals
that the Federal loan programs were designed to protect and to
benefit are going to be affected by the decision of this Court if

20
it overrules the Fifth Circuit.
This is true because the utilization of the "first in
time" choate lien doctrine ultimately creates a situation where
a lender or where a mechanic will not deal with one who has prev­
iously or is going to deal with the Federal Government.
Apparently the Government had abandoned the choate
lien concept in the context of this case.

In their brief they

utilize the Kimbell argument as their first argument, and I
gather today that counsel has admitted to the Court that choateness is not a concept and not a doctrine that this Court need
consider in determining whether or not to extend or amplify the
"first in time" rule.
However, the "first in time" rule incorporates and em­
braces the concept of choateness, so it is somewhat difficult to
separate the two.
The question is whether to expand a rule that was
developed in the context of the tax lien statute and the insol­
vency statute into the commercial arena —
QUESTION:

The "first in time" rule was applied by

courts long before the term "choate" was coined, wasn’t it?
MR. HOLLIS:

The choate test was, in my understanding,

was developed to determine that point in time

at which a com­

peting lien was entitled to compete with a Federal lien.

So you

need to utilize it when you consider the "first in time" doctrine
to determine that point in time which a competing lien may or may

21

not compete.
QUESTION:

But if you go back to 1827, to the case that

applied the "first in time, first in right" rule as the Federal
rule, the Court adopted it —■ it wasn't creating a Federal rule;
it was just adopting what it felt was the common law rule, wasn't
it?
MR. HOLLIS:

That's correct.

Nothwithstanding that fact, the Government attempted
to apply the concept of choateness in this case, and did so in
their brief.
QUESTION:

I understand that in Georgia, if this had

been private, there would be no problem.

I mean, if it had been

a private loan or private instrument, you would have no problem.
MR. HOLLIS:
the State court.

There would be no problem if we were in

But there is a problem inasmuch as the Govern­

ment contended in the Fifth Circuit that the State law is not
clear as to whether or not the mechanic would have a priority
under a strict Georgia statute.
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:

But you say it is clear?
I say it is clear, by virtue of the argu­

ment which we made in the latter portion of our brief, in which
the District Court judge applied in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:

Do we have to buy that in order to affirm?
No.

This Court can affirm the Fifth

Circuit by adopting the Federal common law rule based upon the

22

Uniform Commercial Code that the Fifth Circuit adopted.
You start from the proposition, as the Court has sug­
gested it will, that the Federal law must pertain, then the next
question is, what lav; — or what will be the rule of law.

It

has been suggested that you can go directly to State law and say
we will apply State law, period, or we will fashion a Federal
rule based upon something, whether it be State law or in the case
of the Fifth Circuit, upon the model Uniform Commercial Code.
,

The rule, so fashioned, at least does this:

It is a

commercial rule that was designed and developed for use in a
commercial transaction.

It is not a rule that was designed to

determine tax priorities; it is a rule that comports with 1962
instead of the late 1800's.

It's a recent rule.

The other aspect of utilizing a Federal common law
rule based upon the Uniform Commercial Code, as we will indicate
a little early, and as the Court has become aware with respect
to SBA and FRA, the regulations themselves direct the lending
offices and the direct the agencies to utilize and incorporate
and take advantage of and consider local law and local enterprise
when determining how to transaction their business on a local
level under the Uniform Commercial Code.

It does embrace a

concept of locality, the very same law which the Government
relied upon in this case to originally protect its security
interests.
This Court has never applied the "first in time" rule

23
to any area of commerce.

It has been restricted to the tax

lien area and the insolvency statute, though the Government has
prevailed upon some of the lower courts to extend and amplify
that doctrine.

There is no statutory basis at all for extending

the doctrine.
Again, the FHA regulations belie the point that the
Federal Government makes in its brief.

They contend that the

"first in time" rule is a uniform, universal rule, and that there
are no exceptions —
QUESTION:

Does the FHA statute say that whenever money

is advanced the Government shall have a lien?
MR. IIOLLIS:

No.

The statute itself requires that FflA

advances be secured as the Secretary deems necessary and approp­
riate, so it directs that FIIA conduct themselves as a commercial
lender, that they take back security for moneys advanced.

The

regulation —
QUESTION:

Well, the tax laws say that at a certain

time in the process of collecting taxes the lien shall arise.
It specifically gives the Government — it creates the lien.
Is there anything similar to that in the FHA, or in
any of the regulations?

Do the regulations say that — what

kind of paper the FHA takes to evidence its lien and that sort
of thing?
MR. HOLLIS:

The regulations — Reading the regulations

is similar.to the experience of reading the Uniform Commercial

24
Code.

You have the concept of a security agreement which was

developed in the —■
QUESTION:

So all this is right in the regulations, I

take it?
MR. HOLLIS:

Yes, sir.

It's part and parcel.

For

example, there is even one portion of the regulations that informs
the local lender about an esoteric farm loan for less than $2500,
which is a model U.C.C. provision.
QUESTION:

It's really a—

So what if you found in this set of regulat­

ions a provision that is strictly in conflict with (a), the
Uniform Commercial Code, the model act, and (b) the way it's en­
acted in a particular State?

Would you think the regulation

would govern?
MR. HOLLIS;

Under the Government's position —

QUESTION: I'm talking about your position.

What if,

say, the regulation was flatly contrary to a prevision in the
Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the relevant State; would
the regulation govern or not?
MR. HOLLIS:
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:

To determine priorities?
Yes, for example.
We contend that it would not, that the

Uniform —
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:

Because why?
Because the Court should apply a Federal

rule, such as the one fashioned by the Fifth Circuit —

25
QUESTION:

I know.

But you apparently concede that

it would be Federal law.
MR. HOLLIS:
apply Federal law.

I don’t concede that this Court should

But apparently the Court has already indi­

cated that the base question is whether or not to consider this
as a Federal case or as a purely State case.
QUESTION:

Well, aren't there two different questions:

One is whether it is a Federal question as to the priority of
the lien; another question is, conceding that it's a Federal
question, does the Court deciding that Federal question refer to
a body of State laws, to a body of Federal common law, or to some
other body of law.
MR. HOLLIS:

I think that's exactly what I'm attempting

to say, is that those are the two questions.

First, are we going

to decide it conceptually as a Federal rule, and then be fashioned
as a Federal rule, or go directly to State law as a Federal rule.
QUESTION:

But if it is a Federal law, then if it is

a Federal question, and an agency regulation was issued coverning
the disputed issue precisely, wouldn't it take precedence over
the State law?
MR. HOLLIS:

I suppose, if the regulation was not in

conflict with the Federal rule that was adopted, that it would.
QUESTION:

If it weren't in conflict with the statute,

with the Federal statute?
MR. HOLLIS:

Well, in this instance it would have to be

26
in conflict with the case law because there is no statute.
QUESTION:

If we decided in this case that it was the

duty of the courts, State and Federal, to apply State law, for
example, that as a matter of Federal law or whatever the duty
was to apply State law, then the FHA could hardly come out with
regulations to the effect that the State law would be disregarded,
could it?
MR. HOLLIS:

The way I understand it, and the way I

understood the discussion earlier, the FHA can issue almost any
kind of regulations it wants to.
QUESTION:

Quite in defiance of what might be decided

in this case by this Court?
MR. HOLLIS:
QUESTION:

That's my question.

I'm not sure whether they —
Let's say this Court should decide in this

case and its predecessor that what is applicable is the body of
State substantive law in this area, whatever the State might be,
of each of the 50, wherever the transaction is made.

Could the

FHA in this case, or the SBA in the previous case, then come out
with rules or regulations saying that State law shall be wholly
disregarded and that our liens shall have this and that and the
other priority regardless of the provisions of State law?
I'm just referring now to my brother White's question.
MR. HOLLIS:

I think they could, but it would not seem

to me they would be enforceable regulations.
QUESTION:

Why not, unless we put our decision on a

27
constitutional basis, saying that this is the only way the
Government can run its business, by constitutionally following
State law.
None of our cases ever suggested the "first in time"
rule and choateness was constitutionally routed, did we?

It has

just been a sort of Federal common law that Congress is perfectly
free to pre-empt and supersede.

Similarly, I suppose one of its

agencies, if it was authorized by statute to do so.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it isn't a question of whether

there's any statute giving it such authority.

You're not assum­

ing there is some statutory basis for FHA to draft one set of
priority rules and the SBA to draft another set, and each govern­
ment agency to draft rules that it thinks

will help in these

priority lien situations, are you?
QUESTION:

And all such rules inconsistent with whatever

the Court says in these two cases.
QUESTION:

I don't know.

I think you are partially

relying on it because the FHA has already subordinated some of
its liens to — some State liens, when it didn't have to, hasn't
it?
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:

Yes.
If the "first in time" rule is applicable,

it has.
QUESTION:

In case you feel like an innocent bystander

(Laughter) — do you agree with the implication contained in my

28

broth Stevens' question, that the agency would have to have either
implied or express authority under the statute to draft the regul­
ations which my brother White has referred to?
MR. HOLLIS:

The way I read the regulations, the enabling

act, the agency is given the authority to do specific things, one
of which is to make farm loans or operating loans.

They are en­

titled to draft legislation or regulations to implement that.
There is nothing in the enabling statute which would give the
Government the authority to have a superpriority.
So I would not think the drafting of regulations which
granted the Government superpriority over mechanics liens and
purchase money security interests and so forth would be a valid
exercise of the agencies power.
We draw on two statutory — two pieces of legislation
to support our position that the "first in time" rule should not
be extended.

One is the Uniform Commercial Code and the other

is the Tax Lien Act of 1966, which as the Court indicated in the
Kimbell argument earlier eroded the basis for the extension of
the "first in time" rule and, in fact, makes a specific exception
with respect to mechanics liens and those who retain possession
of personal property for the purpose of asserting a repair lien.
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:

With respect to Federal tax claims?
With respect to Federal tax claims alone.

We contend in our brief that the logical extension of the "first
in time" rule would mean that the Government would take superiority

29
over purchase money security interests.
In its reply brief? the Government notes that in analy­
zing that contention? that the purchase money security interest
would fail? it relies upon the Tax Lien Act of 1966 and the
Uniform Commercial Code and some tax revenue rules.

The import­

ance of this is that the Government tux*ns to statute and State
law and tax law to determine that it may or may not? as it chooses
to do so? have a priority over purchase money security interests.
So the Government flounders for a basis for this exception? but
it cannot be found.
If "first in time" prevails? it has no exceptions.

So

what we're asking this Court to do is? number one, not extend
the doctrine in the first instance? and number two, to carve out
an exception, if it is so extended? such as that exception found
in the Tax Lien Act, but more particularly, we would wish that
this Court apply the rule of law that the Fifth Circuit applied
out of a Federal common law based upon commercial rules.
QUESTION:

Aren’t there some problems? Mr. Hollis,

if you apply a Federal common law? presumably the reason that
you're doing it is to achieve some sort of certainty; and yet,
if yoix resort to the U.C.C. as interpreted by the States? you
run into quite a variety of interpretations of some provisions.
MR. HOLLIS:

Well? the policy question? from the other

side of the coin? is are you putting certainty into the commerc­
ial business arena.

Certainly it is certain and sure and clean

30

for the Government.
But it is reasonable to anticipate that people will
attempt to make an effort to work within the confines of the
choate lien doctrine, the "first in time" rules.

So if the

"first in time" rule is expanded so that the Government has a
superpriority over after acquired liens, the private sector will
then come in and make an effort to work with those rules.

So you

have complexify on the private level, which is, of course, counter­
balanced by the uniformity and simplicity on the Federal side.
QUESTION:

Quite apart from differing constructions of

the U.C.C. by the various state courts, you have in this context
the U.C.C. itself gives this super seniority to mechanics liens
of this type, unless the lien is created by State law and unless
that State law provides that there should be no super seniority.
And we are told there are some 10 to 13 States that don't give
super seniority, so you wouldn't get anything like uniformity in
this area, would you, under the U.C.C. itself?
MR. HOLLIS:
QUESTION:

Under the U.C.C. itself you would not.
No.

Because it defers to State law in this

respect.
MR. HOLLIS:

Under the Fifth Circuit rule you would get

uniformity.
QUESTION:

But you don't know where the Fifth Circuit

is going from one case to another under Judge Goldberg's opinion,
do you?

31
MR. HOLLIS:

Well, there were faced with a mechanics

lien, and the priority, vis-a-vis affected security interest by
the Government.

They decided that one question.

QUESTION:

Yeah.

QUESTION:

Was that a John Deere tractor?

MR. HOLLIS:
QUESTION:

Then where do we go next?

Alis-Chalrrers.
With someone named Zac Crittenden as the

mechanic.
MR. HOLLIS:

There are traditional exceptions to a

"first in time" rule as a layman would know it, that "whoever
gets there first wins".
money security interest.
States recognize.

Some of the exceptions are the purchase
Others are the statutory liens that

Those are traditional in nature.

So you're

talking about a rule that the Fifth Circuit fashioned to deal
with a very traditional kind of case, a very normal kind of
transaction on a very local, low level.
From the standpoint of the Tax Lien Act of 1966, they
carved out a similar exception for a repairman and for an
attorney's lien, and for a perfected purchase money security
interest.

So you're talking about exceptions to the time-honored

"first in time" rule, and you're talking about traditional except­
ions.

There is nothing so unusual or esoteric about the mech­

anics lien.

It has been around for years, especially one that is

possessory in nature.
QUESTION:

What is the situation — if it's possibly

32
relevant, and if you know — in most of the States as to the lien
of the material man, the painter or anyone else who paints a
house that has a mortgage on it?

In all the States I know about

first-hand, which would be six or seven, the material man's lien
was superior to the lien of the mortgage, even though the mortgage
was first in time.
Is there any relationship between these two in terms
of doctrine?
MR. HOLLIS;

There is the relationship, the concept of

the material man or the mechanic, that he is one who improves
or enhances the value of the property.
QUESTION:

He is -- Well, if he doesn't enhance it,

he at least is preserving the security, isn't he?
MR. HOLLIS;

At least, at least.

And the Fifth Circuit

fashioned in this case to provide protection for one who says
that it does not preserve it.
QUESTION:

Let me put it another way.

If you know, do

you know of any States in which the material man's lien would
be subordinate to the first lien of the real estate mortgage in
the circumstances I mentioned?
MR. HOLLIS:

I cannot name the States, but there are

States that do not, for example, have a statutory material man's
lien in the first instance, or that do not give it priority to
a prior perfected first mortgage.

The similar situation is true

with respect to personal property, apparently, because the

33
Government has cited some laws of some 13 States which do not
give a superpriority to the repairs of the mechanic.

So the rule

would vary, depending upon the State.
In its brief the Government seemed to elevate the importance of its lending programs to a constitutional level, and
whatever the underlying or underpinnings of the Government lend­
ing programs are, they are certainly different from the functions
it performs as a taxing entity.

In the tax arena, the Government

is an involuntary predator, and the debtor is simply a neutral
party.
However, in a Government lending program the Government
participates with, bargains with, considers with, talks with its
prospective borrower.

It’s a voluntary enterprise and it is

characterized by a commercial business dealing.

A rule which

comports x^ith commercial business dealings is one fashioned by
the Fifth Circuit, a Federal common law rule based upon the
Uniform Commercial Code.

But the utilization, expansion and

amplification of a. "first in time" rule which does not comport
with commercial expectations, inasmuch as it does not recognise
any exception but is all-encompassing and, of course, in con­
junction with the choate test, is one by and through which as
the Fifth Circuit said the Government always wins.

So the utilis

ation of a commercial doctrine as opposed to one that does not
recognise the realities and practicalities in dealing with the
business world would be a more appropriate rule for this Court

34
to fashion in the absence of any Congressional legislation to
the contrary.
It has been suggested that the Government needs to ful­
fill a particular interest in protecting its property.

However,

as the exceptions to the Tax Lien Act of 1966 reflect, the
attorney's lien, the repairman's lien, the Government is not hurt
by the recognition of exceptions to the "first in time" rule.
Insofar as the purchase money security interest is
concerned, the Government never had it; if the Government was not
on the scene, the debtor would not have had an opportunity to ever
obtain additional collateral.

But the proprietary interest that

the Government has in the debtor's collateral and the debtor's
property is not defeated, divested, defeased, or eroded by the
failure to apply the "first in time" rule.

The Government, in

fact, is better off in this case, after the tractor is repaired,
than before it was repaired —
QUESTION:

Bid you say earlier you thought the District

Court was right on Georgia law?
MR. HOLLIS:

I believe the District Court was correct

with respect to —
QUESTION:

So you think under Georgia law, if the FHA

had been a private lender, having perfected its lien the way it
was perfected here, it would have been subordinate to the mech­
anics lien?
MR. IIOLLIS:

No.

I think that under Georgia law it

35
would have — Yes, yes, it would have been subordinate to the
mechanics lien.
QUESTION:

Not only for the last bill but to all of

them; is that right?
MR. HOLLIS:

I contend that, and I contended it in the

Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION:
MR. HOLLIS:
QUESTION:

But isn’t that what the District Court —
That's what the District Court did.
And you think that's consistent with Georgia

law?
MR. HOLLIS:

As the Fifth Circuit noted, there is not

any case where anybody ever gave the property back and went and
got it again.
QUESTION:

Well, the District Court expressly found

that whether under Georgia law or under Federal —

Did the District Court so find with respect

to the first six repair jobs?

The entire repair bill.
But you're no longer asking

You’re just
You haven't

cross-petitioned?
MR. HOLLIS:
QUESTION:

I have notcross-petitioned.
You do not now have a claim for the first

five repair bills as I understand it.

36

MR. HOLLIS:

By virtue of not having cross-petitioned,

that's true.
QUESTION:

That's true.

But as a matter of the rule to

be adopted, it really makes a difference whether you say you
adopt the Uniform Commercial Code without the reference to State
law, or whether you would just adopt the Uniform Commercial Code.
MR. HOLLIS:

We believe the Fifth Circuit's rule, where

it adopted the Uniform Commercial Code with reference to State
law, is the appropriate rule.
QUESTION:

I know.

But then it didn't follow that.

It didn't go -- It didn't follow Georgia law in that —
MR. HOLLIS:

It didn't decide the whole case.

In fact, the District Court held that we had an equit­
able lien on the tractor.

The Fifth Circuit said it did not feel

compelle! to reach that question in light of the view it was
taking of the case.
Then, insofar as the Georgia law is concerned, the Fifth
Circuit looked to see whether or not a mechanics lien was avail­
able under Georgia law, and determining that it was, made refer­
ence to the Uniform Commercial Code, the Federal Tax Lien Act.
On the question of complete and total possession, the
Fifth Circuit noted it could find no case on the subject, and we
couldn't either.
QUESTION:

Clarify for me, if you will, what do you say

is the status now here in this Court, of the District Court finding

37
about Georgia law?
MR. HOLLIS:

I believe that the District Court's de­

cision with respect to Georgia law could be the basis for this
Court upholding its interpretation of Georgia law in granting
Crittenden the superpriority in this case.
QUESTION:

Now, what did the Fifth Circuit do about

that?
MR. HOLLIS:

The Fifth Circuit did not need to reach

the question of —
QUESTION:

Should we decide that here when the Fifth

Circuit — Assuming we thought we should reach it, should we
decide it here when the Fifth Circuit did not reach it?
MR. HOLLIS;

I don’t believe that this Court should

decide it, first of all, or secondly, that they need to; that it
can either remand it to the Fifth Circuit or it can adopt the
opinion of the —
QUESTION:

But I take it you agree, that if the Court

concluded we needed to decide that, we needed to decide it, we
shouldn't decide it here when the Fifth Circuit didn't reach it;
is that right?
You say we don't need to reach it, but — I'm talking
hypothetically now.
MR. HOLLIS:

I don't believe you need to decide that.

In conclusion, the choate lien test and the "first in
time" rules transported into the commercial area cannot help but

38

create confusion.
I see my time has run out.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Barnett, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BARNETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETT:

One single point, Mr. Chief Justice.

The question has been suggested that the Clearfield
Trust case and the policies inherent in it perhaps need reconsid­
eration by the Court.

I would simply point out that the court

below in both of these cases explicitly held that Federal law
governs.
The cert petition presented no question on this score,
and if the Court would be interested in reconsidering Clearfield
Trust, we would be interested in submitting a brief on that quest­
ion.
Now, I know it hasn't been suggested that Clearfield
Trust be reconsidered with respect to the question of whether its
a decision of Federal law or not.

Exit we would submit that if

State law is to be borrowed, on a wholesale basis, that implicates
the policies embodied in the Clearfield Trust decision.

We submit

that the main policy embodied there is uniformity, and if State
law is to be borrowed on a wholesale basis, one is going to en­
counter uncertainty, sacrifices of the Federal interest, and per­
haps even more uncertainty than one would have if one decided that

39

it was a State —
QUESTION:

But it doesn't remove the matter from

Congressional reach or from agency reach if Congress gave the
agency the regulatory authority.
MR. BARNETT:

That is true, that is true.

I simply wish to suggest that if that question is to
be reconsidered, we would be willing to submit a brief on it.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The

case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:20 p.m., the case in the above-entitled
matter was submitted.]
