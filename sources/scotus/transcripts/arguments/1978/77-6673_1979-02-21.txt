PRO CEEDINGS
ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Brown against Texas.
Mr. Caballero, I think you may proceed whenever you
are s-eady now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND C. CABALLERO, ESQ0 ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. CABALLERO:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Brown vs a Texas is a direct appeal from 'the County
Court at Law No. 2 for El Paso County, Texas,, from a
misdemeanor conviction for failure to identify himself, the
/

/

appellant and give a report of his name and address.
The facts are that on December 9, 1977, at approxi^
iu«u.«ly noon, two uniformed El Paso police patrolmen, in a
squad car, looked down an alley and noticed appellant and
another individual who were apparently only a couple of feet
apart, walking in opposite directions.

The officers could

not tell if the individuals had met or had spoken. Both men
ware black.

No other activity was noticed.

There was no report of suspicious or criminal
activity.

The officer stated that he decided to stop

appellant and ask him his name, and that that was the sole
purpose for the stop.
The appellant was stopped, and the officers did ask

4
him for his name, and also for the reason for his presence in
the alley.

,

Appellant protested the stop# stating that the
officers had neither right nor reason to detain him.

He

C,:

..

not resist the arrest or stop.
Brown was patted down then# and no weapons. drags
any other contraband were found on his person.

But he was

placed under arrest for the failure to identify himself.
The other individual in tile alley was never stopped
or questioned.
On the way to jail appellant gave the officers his
name# but he was still booked for the offense# the officer
stating that in his viewpoint the offense was complete at that
point.
He was later on found guilty in a non-jury trial# and
was fined $45.
How# tile provision in question does not carry any
j®5.1 term or imprisonment# it simply provides for maximum
penalty of a $200 fine.
The provision is Section 38.02 of the Texas Penal
Code# which makes it a misdemeanor to refuse to give a report
of one®s name, and address to a peace officer who has lawfully
stopped-one and requested that information.
This case is significantly different from DeFiHippo#
which you have just heard# in the following respects s

5
The Detroit ordinance at least attempted to put in
some sort of a Terry standard that there must be suspicious
conduct or criminal conduct afoot? which would allow a police
officer to investigate further and ask for one’s name»
The Texas statute does not have any such requirement,
QUESTIONs

Well? it has the word 5(1 lawful"*

MR* CABALLEROs
QUESTION;

That’s correct? Your Honor,,

Well? if you assume that the Texas courts

understood what a lawful stop was? and convicted this person?
you would have thought that? as an initial matter? they
thought the stop was lawful? and that? therefore? there was
9

at least a valid Terry stop®
MR® CABALLEROs

I think? Your’ Honor? that if you use

the word ’’lawful” in a statute such as this you can? I suppose?
read in all kinds of standards®

However? to a person reading

the statute? on its face? -»■
QUESTION;

That’s a vagueness argument®

MR® CABALLERO;
QUESTION %

That’s correct? Your Honoar®

Now you’re making a vagueness argument:?/

but you were just making a statement that the Texas statute
didn’t have any standard in it# different from the “■»
MR® CABALLEROg

What I’m saying is that simply by

reading ”unlawful"? there is nothing to tell you whether it
must be criminal activity? for example.

It may be that the

Texas Legislature thought it was lawful for a police officer

6
to stop a person walking down the street and ask him for his
name for no other reason,
QUESTIONS

Well, then you do

you are suggesting

that neither the Texas Legislature nor the Texas courts knew
what alawful” meant,
MR, CABALLERO?

I*ia suggesting they probably didn’t

consider it carefully enough* Your Honor,

The statute is not

drafted carefully enough to set forth what is lawful and what
is note and that is one of our principal arguments here.
Now? also in DePiHippo there was evidence of other
criminal activity?

drunkenness,, perhaps some sort of indecency*

sexual conduct* possession of drugs* possibly impersonation of
a police sergeant.
In this case here we are solely dealing with an
offense involving only one type of criminal conduct* and that
was tlifc offense of falling to identify himself.
Now* DaFiHippo did not involve a prosecution for
failure to identify? this case does involve that kind of
prosecution,

Also in DeFillippo* of course* there was a

question of goad-faith reliance of the police officer on the
ordinance,
Eefor® the trial court and before this Court*
appellant has challenged the constitutionality of the Texas
statute for facial vagueness and for overbreadth* because it
punishes not innocent conduct* Your Honor* but protected

?
conduct®

And there's- a big difference»

Conduct protected by

the First* Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States
Constitution* making the statute therefore invalid under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment®
The first question that comes up is a vagueness
arguments

Can a police officer ask someone questions?

This

is apart from the ability to stop someone® Can he ask someone
a question?
The point brought up by Mr® Justice White *»»
QUESTIONS Well* the answer to that is clearly yes*
he can ask* can't he?
MR® CABALLEROs

1 agree* Your Honor®

same rights —- I can ask people questions®
QUESTION?

He has the

1 can stop —

Well* particularly a police officer can®

MR® CABALLEROs

That is correct®

He has the same

rights as any other citizen to ask questions®
QUESTION; Well* at least those rights®
MR® CABALLEROs

Up to a point* Your Honor* where it

becomes harassment or where you're —
QUESTION!

To inquires

MR® CABALLEROs

What is your name?

Simply that point® For example* if

I'm arguing a case up here and a police officer came up to me
right now and asked me what is my name* I don't know if that
would be a reasonable type of inquiry* Your Honor®
there are conceivable instances —

I think

8
QUESTION %

Well; Mr» Brown wasn't arguing a case

her®; was he?
MR» CABALLEROs

That's correct# Your Honor»

I'm

saying that conceivably there could be limitations on a
person's right to ask questions»

But I think# as a general
<a>

proposition# under moot fact situations# he does have a right
to ask questions»
Now# what about the stop?

The way I read Davis vs»

Mississippi # the Fourth Amendment is? applicable to any kind of
stop»

"Detention*9# "arrest"# they are all the same# as I

understand the reading of Davis vs» Mississippi»
QUESTION* Wall# Terry v, Ohio said the same thing#
didn't it?
MR» CABALLEROs
that case

I believe it did# Your Honor»

In

I can't ex plain Terry vs„ Ohio# Your Honor»

The

only way X can say it is that under Terry you are simply
trying to protect the life of a police officer who# thinking
there is criminal activity afoot# No» 1# and two# thinking
that he might be in a dangerous position# he is simply able
to pat someone down before he starts asking the questions»
In this -*»
QUESTION*

Let's put this# for hypothetical purposes#

out of the criminal area and say that a police car is called
to an automobile collision# and there are a number of people
around»

Do you suggest that the State has no police power to

9
require the persons who observed that automobile collision to
give their names to the police officer?
MR. CABALLEROS
that.

No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting

That’s the problem with this case, that it's not

limited to civil or criminal incidents., And what I suggested
to the Court in my brief was that Texas used to have

the

predecessor statute, which was not a penal statute, a kind of
material witness type statute, provided that the police
officer could round up the witnesses to a civil or criminal
incident, which
QUESTIONS

Well, then, just to take one step at a

time, the First Amendment is no barrier to a statute requiring
a person to identify himself to a police officer at high noon,
with no criminal activity going on?
MR. CABALLERQs

Your Honor, the statute that I'm

talking about does not make you identify yourself.
a choice of doing two things?

YOu have

first, you can identify your­

self or, if you stand mut® and refuse to identify yourself,
then the officer must take you before a neutral magistrate,
at that time make provision for a material witness bond,
or to identify yourself.

But no statute — I'm not suggesting

to this Court that any statute, civil or criminal, can make
you, under the pain of criminal violation, state what your
name is or say anything.

Anything that comes from your mouth,

as far as I'm concerned, Your Honor, is a violation of both the

10

First and. Fifth Amendmentse
QUESTION?

It's orally compelled»

Bat then if you refuse to do that before

■the magistrate? in this hypothetical situation, then what?
MR, ChBALLEROs

Then ha places you under a material

witness bonds if you can't make bond*, then you're in jail,
Your Honor»
QUESTION*

I suggest to you that that pretty well

washes out the First Amendment argument you're making»
MR® CABALLEROs

Well* let me talk about the First

Amendment thing, Your Honor»
Let's assume that you have the fact situation of
NAACP

Alabamag that is*, the situation where you have a

group of persons who , for their own protection , are trying to
unite and, let's say, get rid of racial segregation, which was
the case there? and the State was violently opposed to — at
that point at least — to the NAACP.

And you want to find out,

as a State officer, who the members are of the NAACP.
Now, this Court held, under NAACP v. Alabama, that
a court could not compel NAACP to give up its membership lists.
I*m suggesting to this Court that there is a First Amendment
violation potentially h©re, if I could stop every single
person who nad attended an NAACP meeting on their way out
os she meeting and asked them, "What is your name?»»
If the person refuses to give his name, then I march
him on down to jail and have him fingerprinted, and try to

Ii
ascertain their identification through some other means®
I am suggesting, Ybur Honor, that there is a First
Amendment violation®
QUESTIONS

Wasn't that decided, at least in part,

though, ©n the theory of the freedom to assemble and petition
for redress of grievances?
MR® CABALLEROS
QUESTION®

Yes®

MR® CABALLEROs
Your Honor®

In NAACP?

They spoke more broadly than that,

I believe they said that prix^aey in one’s

associations are involved in the freedom of the association,
that in some instances your freedom to associate is endangered
if the privacy is not there®

The Iranian student type thing,

©r the “°» your ability to redress and to protest anonymously,
Your Honor®
QUESTIONS

Here your client, I take it, wasn’t

engaged in any comparable activity to that in NAACP vs®
Alabama?
MR® CABALLERO*
activity is closer

No, Your Honor, I think my client’s

and still First Amendment protected

right, which this Court decided in Norwell vs® Cincinnati,
where a police officer approached a gentleman walking under —
with a suspicious person report afoot? and he stopped Mr®
Norwell and h© asked him what he was doing there at that time
of night, and Mr® Norwell simply said, 911 don't tell you any-

12
things in those wordsj and this Court held that was protected
activity.

It’s a non-provocative protest of an arrest.

And

I think my case is closer to that.
QUESTIONS Did that case go off on freedom of sperr?.?
MR. CABALLEROs

I believe — you just said it was

protested activity,, I can only assume —
QUESTION s

Your man here is arrested for — not for

what h® said but for what he didn't say.
MS. CABALLEROs
Honor.

Well, he did say something, Your

And he did pretty mush the same —
QUESTIONs

But he wasn't arrested for that.

MR. CABALLEROs
QUESTION?

Pardon me, Your Honor.

Was he arrested for what he did say?

MR. CABALLEROs

They didn’t — he was arrested for

mmt he did not say.
QUESTION:

Yes, that’s what Mr. Blackmun was bringing

out.
MR® CABALLERO:

But he did say something, and that

was ^hafe he protested the right and reason of -the officers to
detain him under the circumstances in this case.
By implication, if you say ~ to taka the question
earlier of what "lawfully*9 means; by implication, if I only
have to give my name under the Texas statute when I am lawfully
stcppad, it would mean that if I am not lawfully stopped, then
I don’t have to give my name.

13
Now* when ia on© person supposed to know that he is
?

not lawfully stopped?

Under the [CimessttlesJ case* under

Tarry* under Davis vs® Mississippi*

a. person •»*» let's assume

you had a constitutional scholar walking down the street and
he knew about those cases
QUESTIONS

hlhen is somebody supposed to know when

th©r@ is probable cause fc© arrest?
MR® CABALLERO?

You don't®

You are. simply arrested*

That's a fact®
But in this ease* apparently a person has an option*
at least for a little while* to thinks

Is this a lawful

arrest or is it not?
QUESTION? Well* 1st ra® ask yous

what if there's

probable cause* what if a policeman thinks there's probable
cams© to arrest and he arrests' him* and ha asks him his name*
Bo you think the State could then make the refusal to give
the name a crime?
MR® CABALLERO?

Right* Your Honor* Then you’re

getting into © different ar©a* Your Honor»
QUESTION? Well* could you or not?
MR® CABALLEROi

No* I don’t think you can* Your Honor*

beeaus© it’s still protected activity®
QUESTION?

Because it would be vague?

MR® CABALLERO?

No* Your Honor®

That’s getting out

of vagueness* and you're getting into th© area of overforeadth*
/'

14
because at that point what you9re doing is you're making
criminal conduct which is protected by the First? Fourth and
Fifth .amendment®0

Mot because of vagueness*

You're setting

aside the vagueness argument at that points
Now? the California statute? the Detroit ordinance
in this case? the Henderson City ordinance? all kind of
incorporate a little bit batter than this statute does the
Terry type criteria»

In this cas© there is nothing ~ I don't

think you could read anything near Terry into the word

”lawfullyM in this case*
Also? what is
QUESTION'S

M.ra Caballero? could I just ask this?

You didn't challenge the lawfulness of the stop in this case?
did you?
MR* CABALLERO5

By filing tile motion to suppress?

I did not? I challenged the statute on its face? Your Honor*
QUESTION: So that the lawfulness? then? we assume?
MRe CABALLEROs

I think that -» my client's activity?

let's say? in this case? if they did have probable cause to
stop my client? I could still challenge the statute»
think you can assume lawfulness in this case.

I don't

What I'm saying

is that there may conceivably be eases where it would not be
a lawful stop.

This may or may not be a lawful stop,

not. conceding —» and did not at the trial court

contend that that’s not a lawful purpose*83
That's in the middle of page 18 ©f the record*
I have never conceded that this stop was lawful*

I9m assuming

the State hare, through its police officers, had soma reason
to snake an initial stop*
MR* CABALLERO?

That's correct*

At that point 1

was before the trial.

in those cases

they ar@ attempting to male® criminal a person's invocation of

No motion to suppress,

You would also assume, for purposes of

decision, that every judge who has to read this statute would
know what, the Terry standard is e and would limit the applica­
tion of the statute to those cases which fall within the

We should assume that, 1 suppose?

MR* CABALLERGt

You would have to assume that®

But,

for purposes of -«QUESTION*

Then it doesn’t seem very vague any more»

That part of the vagueness was that wa didn't really know
whether -they limited

it to the Tarry stops or not*

MR® CABALLEROs

Well, sty understanding of the term

Bvaguensss", Mr* Justice Stevens, is that a person reading
the statute would be able to tell whether his conduct was
criminal ©r note

I thought that was the test of vagueness,

not whether a court somewhere knew what Terry vs„ Ohio held*
But maybe I misunderstood it*

But that's what I thought

vagueness meant*
QUESTION!
just been discussing?

May I coma back to the question you've
One of the elements in this statute is

that the stop must be lawful®

That's what the statute says®

I realise that, you argue that "lawful" could mean a lot of
things,
Brat it seems to me from the record that that element
of the offense may be absent in this case®
attorney, Mr® Patton# on page

The prosecuting

15 of the Appendix, concedes

18
that the stop must be lawful®

He said an officer cannot go

lip to anyone on the street and ask for his name unless the
stop is lawful®

tod if you look at what the officer said#

back on page 28 and later on 31# I think in response to your
questions# at feh® bottom of page 28 you inquired:

"'Did you#

was there my action by my client that he was armed or
committed a crime at that time?05
Til® answer was KMo,w
)

BTh© only thing yon wanted to do was stop him and
ask him his name?18
tod the answer was 88Correct38®
So doesn't that wash the element of a lawful stop
out of this case altogether?
MS® CUBALLERO;

In this case# if I were to have said

the conduct of my client in this case was protected# it was
not criminal# that would be correct# Your Honor® But if you're
raising facial invalidity and vagueness# 1 would say no# Your
Honor®
QUESTION: Well# I understand that# perhaps? but why
do you have to get to the constitutional issue?

If an element

of the statutory offense is#hy concession, absent?
Maybe I'm wrong# but I -MR® CABALLERO:

You don't have to get to the

constitutional issue# Your Honor# you can simply »“ the court
below could have entered a judgment of acquittal# and I suppose

19
this Court *»“
QUESTION?

Well, you have to have some constitutional

basis for setting aside a State conviction»

I don5t ear® what

kind of «**» I do car® what the ground might be, but there has
feo be some constitutional ground»

And are you suggesting that

there wouldn't «“«° that it was without any evidence i whatsoever,
is that it?

Would it be Fourth Amendment or what?

MR» CABALLERO?

Your Honor, the constitutional grounds

would be basically Fourteenth Amendment due process, which would
also bring in the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments»
I'm not suggesting that you not reach the constitu­
tional issue in this case, I was simply «—
QUESTION s

But I take it that whatever — whatever

level ©£ suspicion there might have been in this case, the
Stats courts have apparently said that under the statute it's
enough»

And so that poses at least the constitutionality

of the statute as applied»
MR» GABALLEROs

Yes, Your Honor, as applied, and

also on its face»
QUESTION?

Well, on its face, Mr» Caballero, I

notice in your index of authorities in the front of your brief
the only Texas ease you cite is one saying that the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction only where the fine
level is over a hundred dollars» And it’s very likely not your
fault that you can't get to a higher Texas appellate court?

20
but hav© there bean any Tessas appellate decisions construing
the statute?
MR. CABALLERO?

No, Your Honor„

This question came up earlier, and 1 can answer your
question, I believe, in this manners

If the statute provides

a pretext for an arrest, such as, for example, in DeFillippo,
you find drugs

other violations, you never see this kind of

prosecution arise.

This is a very rare instance.

I don’t even

know how it got this far.
But usually, at that point, prosecutors are
QUESTION*

It is because, Mr. Caballero, you brought

it her®.»
MR. CABALLERO:

Well, Your Honor, I am only defending

my client.
QUESTION* Exactly.
MR. CABALLERO:

The only thing I can say is that

at that point prosecutors ©re simply not interested in
prosecuting someone for the mere refusal to give his name.
And you don* t see •'this kind of prosecution.

No Texas appellate

s

court to my knowledge, and I’ve checked, has ever considered
?
the issue.
In [Cinesetfeles] vs. Texas, that I’ve cited in ray
reply brief, they didn®t cite the statute but the Texas Court
©f Criminal Appeals did give you its viewpoint concerning the
lawfulness of stopping someone on the street and asking their
name.

And so *»*»

21
QUESTIONS

And unless you get a fine of over a

hundred dollarss you will never get a ease to the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals on this»
MR» CABALLEROs
QUESTIONS

That’s correct, Your Honor»

Now, somewhere in your observations you

said that the polio© off leer gave no eas planafcion, except that
h@ wanted his nero©»

I suggest that isn’t quit® accurate»

Th© police officer said, at page 29, just above the middle *—
h<§ referrad to this being a high drug area»

And this is

certainly related to the raason he mad© the stop»

That’s a

part ©f the officer’s explanation»

MR® CABALLEROt
Honor»

H© gave that explanation9 Your

I don’t, sse that anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights are

diminished in any respect because h© happens to bes walking
through a so-called high drug area»

1 don’t think you will

lose any of your Fourth Amendment rights because you happen
to b©'walking through such an area»
QUESTION*

You're going to th© legal argument, which

is your privilege»

I am simply suggesting that the officer

did give a reason»

The reason was that he was being more

observant in a high drug area when toe pcaopla come together
in sin allay»

Obviously, because they might be engaged in a

drug transaction»

They might not be, but that’s his —» there

is a reason given by the officer»
MR» CABALLERO:

That was just suspicion»

QUESTION*

It was just a frivolous or whimsical

idea*
MR® CABALLERO:

If that were' the case, though, Your

Honor, I would imagine that he would want to stop the other
party to the drug transaction, and also ask him a question or
two? which they never did*
I guess they assumed that ‘the drugs were flowing from
my elient to the other, which, in the case they really did
believe that and they wanted to make a drug arrest., they would
certainly have stopped both parties*

If they thought my

client-sold, then the other party would have it*
QUESTIONS

Is there any evidence what happened to

the other man?
MR® CABALLERO?

The only thing in the record was he

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR® HICKSs

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
My name is Renee Hicks, and I represent the State of
Tessas on tills appeal*
The statute challenged here is Section 38.02(a) of

23
the Taxas Penal Coda» And, just generally# it imposes a ■very
limited duty on citizens of the State of Texas in very narrowly

QUESTIONs

To pursue Mr» Justice Rehnquist's

hypothetical, tinder this kind of an ordinance, the really only
safe way that «a citizen can avoid embarrassment at least is
to carry some form of identification on him at all times,
isn't that true?
MR® HICKS5
QUESTIONS
MR® HICKSs

I don't think that's so®
You don't think so?
This statute is different than many

of the other statutes that are similar to this, in that there's
nothing on the faea of the statute that says someone has to
carry identification to support what they speak to the officer®

25
In other words, there’s no requiring of showing of
a validated driver’s license or a general ID card®

It just

says tha person must report his name and residence address to
a polio© officer®

And I don’t think the word "report'9 in this

instance means that they have to report it by showing proof
©f tha identification®
In other words, if someone says, "My name is John
Smith*4 to an officer who has lawfully requested it, tha officer
has no right to say, "Well# prove that you’re John Smith»"
tod fo@ has no right to arrest the person unless he has
independent grounds to think that tills is a false identified»
tion®
QUESTIONt Well, counsel, I take it then that you’re
suggesting we should judge this case on the grounds that the

permite an officer feo stop any person at any time, regardless
of the circumstances# and ask his name? and,if the person
refuses, to arrest him?
MR® HICKS?

Mo, Your Honor# I’m not saying that®

The statute requires that there b@ a lawful stop®
QUESTION? Well, I’m just asking
then?

I will ask you

Is it a lawful stop to just stop any person indis»

criminately and ask their name?
MR® KICKS?

Well# it may not be an unlawful stop,

but I do think that the words " lawful stop'5 in this instance

f

26
carries with it a certain technical meaning. The Terry vs» .Ohio
type of stop*

was a lawful stop; it had to hold so in order to convict this

MR* HICKS t

That was implicit in the judgment of

MR* KICKS?

Well, there’s “**=*

I’m just trying to help you out*

[Laughter* ]
MR* HICKS s

X understand that.

But T do

that 'the lawful stop requires a Terry vs, Ohio stop.

It may

be that the court in this situation did not read it that, way*

Possiblet but we haven’t yet,

MR. HICKS:

QUESTION 3 And this is the sol® construction of this
statute we have, that the stop by this policeman of this
petitioner was a lawful stop, or else there couldn’t have been
a conviction.
MR. HICKS:
QUESTION?

1 think that’s correct.
And if you assume they knew what the law

was, you would think it was at least a Terry stop? is that it?
MR. HICKS %

That is my argument before this Court,

QUESTIONs Well, what —
MR. HICKS s

It is possible that there was not —

that this Court would find, if it was independently reviewing
the evidence, that there was a lawful Terry vs. Ohio stop.
QUESTIONt

What if the El Paso County Court says?

"lawfully stopped" under this statute means "lawful" for
purposes of Federal Constitutional law, as well as Texas law,
and 1 conclude this was a valid Terry stop,
which is hearing the case now, says t

And this Court,

No, we do not think ip
>■

was a valid Terry stop.
We would simply reversa on an as-applied basis,
wouldn’t we?

"

QUESTION?
MR. HICKS:

... x s .
Unh-hunh.
Well, I don’t think that it’s — the

issue of a lawful stop has constantly been pushed to the back-

2 fi
ground by Mr® Brown or his compelc

And it is not really before

this Court, whether there was a lawful stop*
1 realise, under Thompson vs* City of Louisville,
this Court has said that there can be a denial of due process
if there is n© evidence to support a conviction*

QUESTION*

Well, it doesn't even «-«* that doesn't —-

that wouldn't be necessarily the ground, it would just foe
that the evidence isn't enough to justify a Terry stop*
MR* HICKS s

I understand —

MR* HICKS s

It was not *»» it was covered by the fact

that Mr* Brown's attorney said that he assumed that there was

QUESTION* Well, if he assumed it, if he assumed the

reason, then wanted the constitutionality passed on, he didn't
present the lawfulness of the stop*
MR* HICKSs
QUESTION *

That's my argument*
May I just ask a question on that?

He did ask the question, as Mr* Justice Powell
pointed out; the only thing he wanted to do was stop him and
ask him his name* And the officer said, "Correct85*
on page 28*

That's

And he says the same thing again a couple of

pages later*

QUESTION:

I really have two problems with that»

Can you -- does not the record show the absence of a lawful
Terry atop, if that’s the fact?
MR. HICKSs

I think that's very possible.

I do think that there were two other ”«*
QUESTIONs

Ho.

Then, if that is true, and if

there is -«* as we can read the record — if there just isn't
any indication of violence and no motive feo do anything but.

and he happened to is© black

and I don't know which is more,

significant as the reason for the. stop? but do we just ignore
that, than?

Or do we «=*» and what can ba don© if it is not

actually a violation of the statute?

There's no appeal in

to the position!

X can only go back

that Mr. Brown ««•

QUESTIONs

Well, then isn't it

don't we then

have to assume, as & matter of Texas law, that the Texas court,
which is the final court construing this statute, has held it
applies more broadly than Terry does?
QUESTION s
MR. HICKS3

Yea®
There are two conclusions, two possible

conclusions that could be drawn, I think®

One could be that

conclusion ■=»«» and 1 don't think that that's the proper one.
The other one would be, 1 think, that the court misunderstood
or misapplied the Terry doctrine.
Tha trial court did not apply the Terry doctrine
properly.

That might be the proper one, and X believe that

that is what's supported by the record.
The reason I say that undor the Texas statute, under
this statute ««•
QUESTIONS

Are you conceding that, do you say?

MR. HICKS:

I'm saying that this Court very well

might find that there was not a lawful stop under Terry vs.
Ohio, if it was independently reviewing the evidence, and if
•the issue was clearly presented to it.
1 do think that the Texas statute requires a Terry vs.
Ohio stop

31
QUESTION s There * a 'no indication in this case that it
does.

None.

In® fact, ail the indications are the other way.

The very fact that this person was convicted on the facts of
this ease.
MR. HICKS:

.Well,, again, I think that the other

there1® another conclusion that can bs drawn, and that is that
it was misapplied? 'fell© Terry doctrine was misapplied.
QUESTION: But you have no basis for submitting that
this law requires, at least in the justification equivalent
to the Terry v. Ohio.
MR® HICKS i
QUESTIONs

MR® SUCKSs

I think that —
There * s no basis in this case for saying

In this ease, but in Tessas statutes -«

for instance, in the Texas Code Construction Act, which governs
the Texas Penal Cods, there is provision in the Tessas Cod®
Construction Act which says that if terms of the statute have
a technical or special meaning, through some means, such as a
court decision, such as Terry vs, Ohio

but it doesn’t

specifically mention Terry_vs. Ohio «=•« then those words in
a statute are to b® given that construction.

QUESTIONg

Well, Terry__ys0 Ohio, in that case the

Court upheld what the police officer did.
statute ©r ordinance covering what he did.

There was no
It didn’t say that

ha couldn’t have don© “more or less*8, it. simply upheld what he

dia

Why are you suggesting that that's a limit of what a

police officer can ever do?
MR® HICKS?

I'm not saying that that's the limit of

what a police officer ean do®
QUESTIONS Well, you just did®
MR® HICKSs

No, I believe I said that under this

statute the tern "lawful stop" is limited by other statutes
in Texas that control the construction that the State courts
would be able to give this statute, to the situation ©f there
being a Terry vs. Ohio stop®

Since Terry

QUESTIONS Well, that's telling us -that Terry v® Ohio
represents the limit of what a lawful stop would ba? isn't it?
MR® HICKSs

I don't think that that's a necessary

conclusion from what I just said about the construction that
would foe given to this statute®
There are stops that might not amount to Fourth
Amendment detention, that would foe termed lawful, I suppose®
X mean, policemen constantly are patrolling their areas,
checking with the merchants, and so on®
QUESTION i

Is it your view7 that the Texas court

concluded that there was a lawful stop hare?
MR® HICKS;

Yes®

I think that that is implicit in

in tie judgment ©f conviction®
QUESTION;
could he?

Otherwise he couldn't have convicted.

33
MR» HICKSg
QUESTIONs

That's correct*
Now# in reaching that conclusion# it's

certainly Hornbook e that the whole record is viewed by that
judge

not necessarily by us# but by that judge# the judge

reaching that conclusion —* part of that record is that this
somewhat inarticulate policeman# and a brand-new policeman
as well# said that part of his motivation,

he implied that

part of his motivation was that it was in a high drug area®
Is it reasonable to conclude# do you think w© could
conclude# that the judge made the decision# that the lawfulness
was demonstrated in relation to the high drug area that the
policeman said was part of his reason?
MR, HICKSt

2 believe that that is one of the factors

on which the judge based his conclusion# implicit in the
judgment at least if not substantive*
QUESTIONS Than is that decision reviewable hare?
MR® HICKS%

I don't boliave it is# Your Honor®

That

is my point# that there is some evidence on the point of
whether there is a lawful stop®

As I say# this Court#

reviewing the record# or the initial trial court might
decd.de that there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt#
that there was a lawful stop»
But tiler© were two factors# I think# heres

one was

that it was a high drug area? the other faetor -- there were
three factors *»*=» the other factor was that these people were

34
in an unpaved alley j and the other factor is -that there were
two people in this unpaved alley in a high drug problem area,
near ©ns another.
Now# those three factors, in isolation# very well#
in fast probably, are not a lawful stop under Terry vss® Ohio.
But there are some evidence on that point.
tod that is the reason 1 suggest that under Thompson
vs? Louisville the conviction could not be reversed, because
there is no evidence on the point.
tod 2 do not believe that 'because a judge in Texas
may have applied Terry vs» Ohio in a way differently than this
Court might have, that that means that that court was saying
that *lawful stop" means something different in texas than it
means under the Fourth tosendmant litigation after Terry vs,
Ohio.
QUESTION« But you*re not contending here, then, that
you can make it a crime «- the State could make it a crime to
refuse to give your aw whenever you’re stopped, for whatever
reason or no reason?
MR® HICKSs

l*m not contending that it can make it

a, crime, that .is correct.

I*m not contending that Tessas has

don® that.
I think it may b© possible °*»

QUESTIONS

Suppose there were no reference by the

policeman in tills record to the fact that he was observing two
man in an alley, in a high drug area,, and that there was
nothing in the record except that he just wanted to find out
th© man*s name? would you think that would be a lawful stop*
a permissible stop under this statute?
Permissible firsts
MR» KICKS?

No»

I would not say that that would have

been a lawful stop under this statute , and I would say that
there would have been no evidence to support a conviction in
•that situation*

Xt8s the

Terry _vs„ Ohio stop that is -QUESTION? There wouldn*t be any evidence of a lawful
stop?
MR» HICKSs

That is correct? there would have been

no evidence on that point «—
QUESTION?

Welly the difficulty with the case is that

we don’t have an opinion from the Texas court, and so we don’t
know whether it’s a question of interpretation of the State
statute that may be troublesome constitutionally, or whether

36
it's an evaluation of the evidence under a perfectly permissible
interpretation of the State statute„
MRo KICKS s

X think that that is one of the main

problems in this ease»
I do think that there is support in Tessas law,,
statutory law, for the argument that this is a Terry vs» Ohio
stop, and again I cite the Texas Code Construction Act which
governs the Texas Penal Code? which says that technical terms,
or ten® that have acquired special meaning, retain that
special meaning in the Codes of Texas»
And there is also a provision that Taxas courts &r©
to construe statutes so as to avoid findings of unconstifeu»

A kind of black-letter law*

tionality.

X did want to address the problem of Norwell vs a
Connecticut

which Mr» Caballero cited as supporting his First

Amendment argument, and 1 do believe .that reading that case
will reflect that the gentleman that, was convicted of disorderly
©oriduct in that case had his conviction reversed by this Court
because d: something h© had said»

It was his — his conviction

was not because of something he had said •»<=>
QUESTIONS

It®s Cincinnatinot Connecticut»

MR„ HICKS?

Cincinnati? I®sn sorry, y@sd

It was a First Amendment question because the great
effort reflected in that ©as© was that he had been convicted
for what he had said, not for violation ©f the statute»

37
He had non-provocatively responded to the officers accosting him.
In this ease, the record reflects that he was
arrested simply for refusing to give his narae after a lawful
stop by the police officer,,
I did want to also distinguish this case from eases
such as Papachrlstou and the other eases that have held vagrancy
statutes unconstitutional, because this statute punishes
conduct not status•

I think that is an important difference,

In Pap a rib, ri & ton g the statute was held unconstitu­
tionally vague because, underlying that decision I think, there
was the feeling that people were convicted for what they were,
not for what they had don©»

I don*fe believe that is the

situation in this sasa,
t

I also wanted to point out -that there is a mens re a
requirement in this statute, it requires an intentional
refusal.

I think this distinguishes this somewhat from the

DeFi Hippo case, which did not clearly contain a mens re a
requirement, tod I think the intentional element, the mens rea
requirement does, under various decisions of this Court, save
this statute from any vagueness that this Court might find
otherwise6

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? All right, you may resuite,
then.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RENEA HICKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE — Resumed.
MR. HICKSi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please +h<*

Court s
The last argument that I would like to address, or
the last issua that I'd like to address, just briefly, is the
Fifth amendment issue that was raised in the brief on appeal
by Mr, Brown's attorney.'
I just wanted t© point out that this is an attack
on the statute on its face on all issues and not in particular,
at this point, on the Fifth Amendment question.

And the

Fifth Amendment self privilege against self^incrimination is
not a right that can be assarted vicariously on behalf of
large group© ©f people.

This Court has many times held that

it's a, personal privilege that must be asserted.
Which brings me to my second point on this, and that
is that Mr* Brown, nowhere in the proceedings until the motion

42
to set aside the information was filed invoked the Fifth

In fact, on the way down to the booking station,

toiendment®

h© told them his name*
toother point 1 would like to make is, tinder
California vs, Byers, at least in a plurality opinion, this
Court has written that a person's name and his address is just
a "'-neutral item of information which is not incriminating in
say way, and it ©an b@ analogized to the taking of blood
samples, the exhibition of the person at a line-up, and such
situationso
One question that has not corns up here so fax, and
was brought up in the DeFillippo eas©, I think Mr« Justice
Whit© asked it, was what about the Miranda situation?

Is it

required that Miranda warnings be given?
tod I’did want to point out that Miranda spoke
briefly to this issue, when it said that it did not apply to
general on-the-scene questioning in circumstances where a crime
might have bean committed, or something like that»
QUESTION$

Of course, a crime wasn't committed

until after the question was asked»
MRe HICKSs
was not®

Well, that's true.

This particular crime

tod what I was saying is, going bask to my argument

that a lawful stop means a Terry__v» Ohio stop, Miranda seemed
to say that in a situation like that you don't need to give
Miranda, warnings, because general on-the~scene questioning is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP RAYMOND C0 CABALLERO, ESQ* ,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLANT
MR® CABALLEROs

Thanks, Your Honor*

Raading Terry into fell®' word© “lawfully stopped” in
looking through the record hare, I don’t know that the court
s'

below ever considered Terry*

And 1 can’t see simply by saying

& State Legislature put in the words * lawful* or ‘‘’unlawful*

reads in or roads ©tit Supreme Court decisions*
And under th@ decision in this Court, Connally vs®
General Construction Company«*the terms of a penal statute
creating a new offensa must be sufficiently explicit to inform
those wh© are subject fe© it®*

That*© the test of vagueness,

not that some court scats place may he able to read in Terry or
read it out in a particular situation*
Otherwise* all you have t© do to make a statute pass
the vageness test her© would be to put in the words “lawfully
stopped* or *unlawful detention* or whatever you may want t©
read into the statute by those words*

QUESTION z

But don*t many statutes in fact do that?

For instance# the Criminal Justice statute says "unlawfully
on the premises® • And it may be a question ©£ considerable
doubt in the particular case ivhefehar a person is or is not
lawfully on the premises®

MR, CABALLERO; I agree with you# elr®
In the situation where you read in the word " lawful"1
that are other standards® For example# ‘’unlawfully on the
premises® normally takes the meaning that you*re on the
premises and you don’t have permission to be there®

But the

words “lawfully stopped® are so vague# it’s a question of
degree# I agree with you? if they are so vague# 883,awfully
stopped18, that in this case# for example# this Court# under
facts that I would consider that it was not a lawful, stop#
simply stepping a parson in an alley who had not been doing
anything wrong, no suspicion or report that he had been doing
anything wrong# ‘«die court held below that it was a lawful stop®
Nov;, what the court did below# feh© court had serious
reservations about, -the constitutionality of the statute# but
simply presumed that feh© statute was valid and read into the
statute# apparently# that this was also a valid stop as applied
in this particular esas®,
Now, if the stop had been unlawful# necessarily my
client would have been acquitted# and you would not be
reviewing 'the statute»

If the stop is lawful «*•» ©accusa me# if

/

48
th© stop was unlawful under the facts of the case, them it
would he like Norwe11, where you simply find that there was
protected activity, and there reach feha constitutional issue
by that means»
tod, incidentally, in Novell veu Cincinnati, I
went back and looked at it, this Court did says

We are

persuaded that the ordinance as applied t© tills petitioner
on th© facte of this case operated t© punish his constitution*»
ally protected speech»
S© that was decided on First Amendment grounds»
Th® Fifth Amendment question In this ease, it's very
difficult sometime® to s©@ how the invocation of th© right
under th© Fifth Amendment can be valid when it applies to
name only? however, in a situation where, for example, 1 saw
a case out of Texas, th© Millar cm® cited in th© brief,
where a person had made a falsa claim for insurance, 'claiming
fee was dead, feh© claim was mad© through his wife? later on
ho was’ arrested»

Had h@ given his nam© as Jo© Doakes or

anything else, that person <=>=> they never would have put the
crime together®
QUESTIONS Well, eren^t you confusing probable cause
with incriminating?

Th© disclosure of th© name may lead to

the arrest, but th® disclosure ©f the name, par s@, doesn't

i.:.^jirr.L z.Jt® hi a,

It merely sets in motion © chain of events

that will bring him into court®

}

49
MR, CABALLERO:

Isn’t that also incrimination?

Incrimination goes beyond mere evidence presented in court.
Incrimination means something that may subject me to prosecu­
tion# and I can’t see how you can totally separate the
concept ©f evidence in court and probable cause# also evidence
to give someone a reasonable cause to arrest a person.
In ■separating the two# 'I have a difficult time with
that.

To m© they ®r@ both incriminations

on® allows

©videnc® to fo@ presented in court ? th® ©t.h@r on© allows my

arrast.
Now# in either ©as® it*s incrimination.
But reaching the constitutionality — how would
you ever# under th® fasts of this eas@ how would you ever test
th® constitutionality of this statute# if you didn’t get
beyond the facts of this particular ©as© and find out whether
there was ©©institutionally protected conduct whi©h was being
J

punished

by the statute here# which is' exactly what appellant

is trying to do®
And is there constitutionally protected conduct#
which this statute ia this case makes criminal?

The fact is

you do have the right to walk down the street and stand mute®
Under the case# Norwell vs, Cincinnati# you do have the right
to walk down the street and tell a policeman.# 581 don’t want
to tell you anything,®*
QUESTION: Well# we get more than that.

)

He verbally

50

and negatively protested.

Now, in your case you don*t have

anything said at all,
MR, CABALLERO*

Yes, we do, Your Honor,

My client said, he protested the reason and the
right of the officers fe© stop him,
QUESTIONs

Yes, but he's being arrested for not

speaking? to wit, identifying himself,

I think it’s a very

different case from Norweli,
I think your First Amendment argument is frivolous.
MR, CABALLERO;

Right.

Under Norweli, whether Norweli was being prosecuted
for saying something or not doing something, the point is that
in that ease tills Court held that it was constitutionally
protected speech.

In other words, telling the polios offlee,

"I don't want to tell you anything8®, this Court held was
constitutionally protected speech.
If someone is asking my name and I tail him, HX
don't want to tell you' anything8’
QUESTION?
First Amendment,

Of ©ours© it protects speech, that's the

The question here is there's a lack of

speech,
MR, CABALLERO? All right, then you get ©loser «°®
QUESTION? What I'm saying is I think you have much
stronger arguments on other Amendments than you do on the
First Amendment, and I think you're spinning your wheels here.

51
MR. CABALLERO: Well, the First Amendment claim 1
s©e as a very real problem,not

aside from the Norwell case

and the ease of a parson who wishes anonymously to protest,
goes to a meeting but doesn't want anyone to know that he is
there*

1 think it's a very real problem*

QUESTIONS

Do you want to pin your case on the

First Amendment?
MR® CABALLERO:

I think it ought to be pinned on the

First, Fourth and Fifth®
Your Honor, they all are bundled so close together
that I don't think any one Amendment ought to decide this case®
I think this is a group ©£ rights that are so close in this
e&@©

■=**=»

QUESTION:

That may be on© of the troubles of the

©as©, you have a shotguns approach here on everything possible®
MR® CABALLERO: Well, it may be a shotgun approach,
taut I legitimately believe that the First, Fourth and Fifth
Amendments all protect the conduct in this case®
Thank you, Your Honor®
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen®

The case is submitted*
[Whereupon, at 1:15 p»ns., the ease in the aboveentitled matter was submitted»1
