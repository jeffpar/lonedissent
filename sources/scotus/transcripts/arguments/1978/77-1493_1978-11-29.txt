MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 1493, Gladstone Realtors against Village
of Bellwood.
Mr. Howe, you may proceed whenever you9re ready.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN T. HOWE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HOWEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court s
I am Jonathan Howe, representing the petitionerdefendants in these cases of Gladstone Realtors and Hintze
Realtors vs. the Village

of Beliwood.

This case comes to this Court by way of a writ of
certiorari, in which the order granting the writ has stated

the question presented as s

whether natural persons and

municipalities, who are not direct victims of discrimination
in the -ale or rental of housing, have any right under
Article III of the United States Constitution or tinder Sections
1982, 3604 or 3612 of Title 42 of the United States Code, to
bring suit against real estate brokers whom they allege to haves
engaged in racial steering, on the theory that racial steering
t*-

interferes with such persons9 generalised interest in living
in an, integrated society.
Our oral argument this morning shall focus upon the
statutory construction of Sections 3604 and 3612, which will

require the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
to be reversed, because these plaintiffs cannot stats a cause
of action tinder 3604 or 3612 of Title 42»
It is our contention that Section 3612, on its face,
provides for the enforcement

of certain enumerated rights

under Section 3604, and that the plaintiffs before this Court
possess none of these rights and therefore have no standing
to pursue or to bring a cause of action»
Section 3612, it is our contention, must be read as
a complementary enforcement provision of the Fair Housing Act,
not as an alternative for Section 3610»
broader range of complainants?

3610 has a much

the person aggrieved concept?

those claiming injury or to have been injured as a result of
a discriminatory housing practice, is far broader than that
provided under Section 3612,
In addition, the legislative history of the Fair
Housing Act is not contrary to the position of these
defendants„
It is incomprehensible that Congress would provide
in Section 3610 for an administrative and agency program and
deferral to States and local governments, and then, two sections
later, totally abandon and provide a mechanism by which that
provision of 3610 could be frustrated and evaded for all
claimants.
As to Section 1982, it is the position of the

5
defendants in this case that plaintiffs have failed to state
a claim under that section and that the decision of this Court
in ^&rfch vs* Saldin, decided in 1975, is dispositive of the
claims raised by the plaintiffs under Section 1982a
These cases were brought by identical plaintiffs in
two actions in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs that are before
this Court include the Village, of Bellwood, an Illinois
municipal corporation, and six individuals, four of whom are
white and all residents of Bellwood, and two blacks, one of
whom is a resident of Bellwood and one a resident of another
municipality.
The defendants in the first case include Gladstone
Realtors, a real estate brokerage firm in Illinois, and six
of its sales people. The second case involves Robert A. Hintze,
a sole proprietorship, the owner of that firm and two of his
sales people.
The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the
defendants had engaged in illegal racial steering, and the
defendants are charged that they undertook efforts to influence
the choice of prospective home buyers on the basis of race
and discouraged prospective black home buyers from purchasing
homes in white areas on the basis of race,,
Jurisdiction is posited in part upon Section 3612
of Title 42

6

In the complaints the plaintiffs sought declaratory
relief, injunctive relief, and over $300,000 in damages*,

The

injury that was alleged to have been sustained by the Village
of Bellwood was that its housing market had been wrongfully
and ilegally manipulated to the economic and social detriment
of the citizens of such village.

The individual plaintiffs

based their injury on two different theories.
Their first theory was that the individual plaintiffs
had been denied their right to select housing without regard
to race,

The second theory, they claimed that they had been

deprived of the social and professional benefits of living
in an integrated society.
Pursuant to discovery, and as a result of discovery
request made by the defendants, the individual plaintiffs
admitted that none of them had aver intended during the period
at issue to purchase or rent a home in Bellwood or to purchase
or rent a home through the services of any of the defendants
in this case.
Based upon that discovery, the

defendants proceeded

to file a motion for a summary judgment in both cases.

The

plaintiffs, it was contended, had not set forth a cause of
action under .Section 1982, 3604 or 3612? and, alternatively,
that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the existence of a
case or controversy under Article III,
Subsequently, Judge Decker, in the Gladstone case,

7
held and ruled in favor of the motion, and held that the
individual plaintiffs were only testers and not bona fide
home seekers and therefore could not be denied the right to
select housing without regard to race,
found

At most, Judge Decker

that the individual plaintiffs had suffered was the

indirect or generalized injury of being denied the benefits
of living in an integrated society.
Judge Decker relied in large part upon the decision
of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in TOPIC ys_„ Circle
Realty,

<r3»Bsarr?ss=sWQca3Sfl-o

In that case the Ninth Circuit had held that a cause

of action under Section 3612 exists only for a direct victim
of a proscribed practice under Section 3604,

The Court went

on to hold til at the Village of Bellwood had not suffered any
cognizable injury.
Subsequently, Judge Perry, in the Hintze case,
adopted Judge Decker’s decision, and the case went on appeal
to the Seventh Circuit,
There the Seventh Circuit found that the individual
plaintiffs themselves had not been denied the right to purchase:
or rent housing without regard to race, because the plaintiffs
did not possess a good- faith interest to enter into the
housing market, and that plaintiffs8 allegations to the
contrary in the complaint had been foreclosed by their
admissions through the discovery process.
Therefore, testers as testers did not have a cause

8
of action9
QUESTIONs

Mr, Howes, was there a cross-petition for

certiorari from that portion of the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit?
MR0 HOWEs

No, sir,, there was not.

No cross-petition

has been filed in this case,,
The Seventh Circuit went on, however, to hold that
the plaintiffs® claim that they had been denied the right to
live in an integrated society was cognizable under Section
3604 and 3612«

The Court made no decision a3 to the claims

under Section 1982«,
The Seventh Circuit, it is our position, erroneously
relied upon the decision of this Court in Trafficante vs.
Metropolitan Life Insurance, where this Court held, under
Section 3610, that residents of an apartment complex who
complained that their landlord's rental practices deprived
them of the social and professional benefits of living in an
integrated community.

The Seventh Circuit, while noting

that Trafficente was not technically controlling, felt that
its thrust arid its rationale suggests that individual plaintiffs
have stending to allege deprivation of a right to live in an
integrated society under Section 3612,
The Court specifically rejected the decision of the
Ninth Circuit in the TOPIC case.

As to the Village, the

Court went on to find without any allegations in the complaint

9
to support the conclusions, that it was apparent that the
concrete injury with a substantial nexus to the Village's
status as a unit of government could be proved»

Based upon

that decision of the Seventh Circuit, this writ was granted*
It is the position of the petitioners and the
defendants that Section 3612 does not authorize the filing in
the United States District Court of a causa of action by the
same class of plaintiffs as would be permitted to fils a
causa of action after the exhaustion of the administrative
remedies under Section 3610»
Section 3612 provides that MThe rights granted by
sections eoo 3604 „*s may be enforced ooa in an appropriate
United States District Court,"

Thus, 3612, it is our position,

limits th© rights that can be enforced to those under 3604«
3604 provides five distinct categories of rights and practices
which it declares to be unlawful*

Not one of those five

categories includes a right or a generalized interest to live
in an integrated society, nor do any of the five categories
provide any generalised right or interest to protect the
economic and social interests of citizens from manipulation
by racial steering»
QUESTIONS

Mr, Howe, you do concede, I guess, don't

you, that the practices alleged by “«■» that were carried on by
th® realtors in this case, known, colloquially at least, as
racial steering were violative of the substantive provisions

10

of tha Act?
MR* HOWEs

For tha procedural process of this case,

Your Honor, that is correct.
QUESTION?

And what section of the Act do you

concede they may violate, Section 3604?
MR. HOWEs

It is arguable, and there is substantial

case law in th© lower courts, that racial steering as to a
direct victim of such, a racial practice does have a cause of
action.

Thar® are some other cases which would —
QUESTION3

I’m not asking about who has the cause

of action» Do you or do you not agree that if the allegations
are true, there was a violation of 3604?
MR. HOWEs

If th® allegations are true, there is a

violation of 3604.
QUESTION;

At least for the purposes of your

argument.
MR. HOWE s For th® purposes of our argument today,
that is correct.
QUESTIONS

But your submission is that the steerea

has to be th® plaintiff under 3612?
MR. HOWEs

That is correct.

That is correct, Your

Honor.
We also note that 3612, by limiting access to the
federal courts to those five categories, is part of a broader
base of the entire statute»

We must look at the entire Fair

11
Housing Act to determine and to see whether the sections , as
divined by Congress, provide a harmonious whole»
The Seventh Circuit disregarded this argument, did
not even address ifc„

It is our suggestion in our argument

that we must compare Section 361,0 with 3612, and we must read
them together*
Now, Section 3610 addresses itself to the concept of
injury sustained as a result of housing discrimination by a
person aggrieved*
In Wfirth vso Saldin, this Court characterized the
decision in Trafficante and Section 3610 as giving residents
of hoiising facilities

an actionable right to be free from

adverse consequences to them of racially discriminatory
practices directed at and immediately harmful to others*
Because they wore persons aggrieved, which is a term of art,
we submit, to give broad opportunity to a class of claimants*
3612, as noted, addresses itself to rights, not to
injury»

Purely for sake of example, this Court has held in

several cases that even if a person is injured as the result
of an invasion of a constitutional right of another parson,
that injured person cannot seek redress of the constitutional
rights of an absent third party»

In fact, in the Alderman

decision, you stated that «Th® established principle is that
/sic/

suspension of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation
can b© successfully urged only by those whose rights were

12
violated by the saarch itself, not by those who are aggrieved
solely by the introduction of damaging evidence9“
And thus* 3610 does provide a cause of action,
however, to these people who have sustained some injury* They
are persons aggrieved*
And, consistent with the decision in Traffic ante,
which does provide for the concept of the private attorney
general, we have to look at this word of art of ”person
aggrieved*8*

It does have significance*

Congress has used that

terminology only when it has wanted to expand the jurisdiction
of courts to hear claims*

It has a well-defined meaning in

the case law of this country, and, as Trafficante showed, the
concept is to extend the broadest and possible standing under
Article III for the injury sustained*
Wa don't need to look at the legislative history for
the Fair Housing Act in this case, because, as this Court
stated in the Kepner case, 5,It is a well-settled rule that the
construction of language in a statute which has a well-settled
and well-known, meaning, sanctioned by judicial decision, is"
QUESTION2

Mr* Howe, if I may interrupt you once

MR* HOWEg

Surely*

QUESTIONS

Do you concede that the — these plaintiffs

more*

do allege that they suffered harm themselves, and do you concede
that they are persons aggrieved within the meaning of Section

13
3610?
MRo HOWEs

Your Honor, I think that the answer to

that question would have to depend upon the extent to which the
decision of this Court in Trafficante would be extended or
broadened to cover the class of plaintiffs in this particular
litigation0
QUESTIONs

Let me change its

do you argue that they

are not persons aggrieved within the meaning of -MRo HOWE s

We take no position because no action has

been raised under 3610 for these plaintiffs,,
QUESTION!

I see,

But they are not ~ but you do

concede, don01 you, that they are suing for an injury to
themselves rather than to third parties?
MRS HOWEs

The injury that they allege to have

occurred to them is a result of an alleged unlawful housing
practice directed to third parties,

They have claimed ~ they

did claim that they had been injured in their personal right
to select housing,
QUESTIONS Right,
*

MRo HOWEs

But the district court and the Court of

Appeals both held that this was not the case, that they were
not bona fide home seekers,
QUESTIONt

1 understand.

But they also allege that

they make the Traffleante allegation that they were denied
the opportunity to live in an integrated community.

14
MR® HOWE*

That is correct,,

That is correct* Your

Honor® But under 3612 as opposed to 3610®
QUESTIONs
alternative*

And your submission* I gather* is in the

either that’s not enough to make them persons

aggrieved* because there’s a little difference between this
case and Trafficante* or* alternatively* even if they are
persons aggrieved* 3612 somehow or other has less broad
coverage®
MR® IOWE*

Our contention* Your Honor* is that 3612

in no way includes the definition of persons aggrieved as being
a person who can bring an action®
QUESTION *

I understand®

It doesn’t have that

language in it* but —
MR® HQVJE *

None whatever®

QUESTION*

it also doesn't have any limiting

language in it* either®
MR® HOWE*

It does not have limiting language* but

our concept of the statutory scheme is that in order to give
meaning to the statutory scheme we must hold that 3610 does
have a broader class of claimants that

can bring an action

or bring the process into force than that which would be
allowed under 3612®
If* on one hand* if we establish a right to go
forward as a person aggrieved in 3610* and then two sections
later we say* ’’Well* you can bypass that administrative

15
process * you can bypass the State and local remedies that are
available* yon can bypass the exemption or the deferral to a
State court by filing under 3612"* the whole concept of two
separate*, distinct* complementary enforcement sections* it’s
our contention* is lost»
QUESTIONs

Of course* the Court of Appeals said

there were alternative remedies,,

MR» HOWE 3

That is the position of the Court of

Appeals* “*»
QUESTION*

Yesa

MR» HOWES

““ to which.* of course* we take exception»

QUESTION?

But" isn’t it also in the congressional

history?
MR» HOWE?

No* Your Honor* it is not»

Because in

the
QUESTION 3

Representative Celler* the floor manage*

said so* didn’t he?
MR» HOWE?

You have tc understand that —

QUESTION s

Didn’t the floor manager say so?

MR» HOWE 3

Yes* he did* Your Honor»

He stated —

the floor manager stated that as far as they were concerned*
based upon an ©pinion that fchay received from the Attorney
General* that 3610 and 3S12 were alternative remedies»

We

agree with that for a direct victim* a person whose rights have
been infringed*

But as to a parson as an indirect victim,

16

who is asserting the rights of absent third parties by virtue
of having suffered some kind of injury themselves, we submit
that was not considered whatsoever during any of the legis­
lative debateso
QUESTION 3

Is there any language in the legislative

history that shows that?
MR® HOWE*

There®a no language whatsoever, Your Honor,

that the Congress of the United States ever considered or gave
thought to an indirect victim bringing an action under this
Act®
QUESTION*

M/ question was*

Is there any language

in the legislative history that said when Congressman Celler
was tfilking he was talking about the aggrieved person?
Which is what you just said®
MR® EOWEs
QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor,

he —

Well, do you have any language in the

history to back you up, or is that your statement?
MR® HOWE*

Our statement, Your Honor, is that

Congressman Celler, when he was working with the bill, looked
at 3610 and 3612 as being alternatives for a direct victim®
We do not find anywhere in the legislative history of the
Pair Housing Act that Congress ever gave consideration to the
class of plaintiffs that are before the Court today®
We think that this Court, however, properly
construed in Trafficantae the concept of person aggrieved of

17
being a broader base area for a parson to bring a claim.
But when it came to 3612, that was not the intention of
Congress.
W©'ve got to remember that the Fair Housing Act was
an Act tliat cam® through great compromise,, it did not have the
benefit of any committae hearings,, it was hammered out on the
Floors of Congress without committee hearings or committee
reportso And thus, much of what may be said on the Floor of
Congress relative to what was intended by the legislation,
wa would submit, Your Honor, may not be worth much for purposes
of interpreting a statutory scheme which we think on its face
is relatively clear.
QUESTION %

Of course, Congressman Caller was also

Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, wasn’t he?
MR. BGWEs

That’s correct, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

You’re not saying ha didn't know what he

was talking about?
MR. HOWEs
that for one minute®

No, I'm certainly not.

I'm not suggesting

I'm suggesting that when he was speaking,

however, h® was speaking solely of people who were direct
victims, not indirect victims.

And therefor®, based upon that

theory, I think you can sea a pattern between the two. And
then when this Court, in Trafficante, took the concept of
parson aggrieved for a Section 3610 case and extended it to
the broadest limits permitted by Article III, that was

18
consistent with the word of art of "parson aggrieved"0
QUESTION?

Wasn't the Traffi.cante suit under both

sections?
MRo

HOWE a

Your Honor, that question has been raised

by the respondents, and while it is true that there had been
an intervention filed in the court below under 3612, the
decision of this Court addressee itself solely to Section
3610„

It does mention, as part of the statutory enforcement

schema, the existence of not only Section 3612 but also 36130
QUESTION;
sic/

Wall, we certainly didn't put Section

812 aside, did we?
MRo HOWEs

You did not. put it aside, but you did not

address it, and Justice Douglas, in his decision, stated that
in all other issues there was no opinion of the Court, and
that the Court was not going to address themB
In the Warth decision and in other decisions

of

this Court, and other courts which have looked at the
Trafflegate decision, they have viewed them as being a
decision under Section 3610,

And the language contained

there, it states that only can you give vitality to Section
3610 by a generous construction which goes to standing to sue
to all in the same housing unit who are injured by the
management of that particular housing unit, and that that
can bo within file ambient of the statute under Section 3610 „
We've got to look at.

19

QUESTION?
MR. HOWE?
QUESTIONg

Mr, Howe, —
Yes, eir?
while you’re interrupted again, I take

it there is no definition or distinction in the statute of
this terra “direct victim”?
MR. HOWEs
QUESTIONS

No, Your Honor, there ->*»
There is a definition of “parson

aggrieved”,
MR, HOWEs

There is, indeed,

QUESTION? But you would say this claim to have been
injured by the housing practice, that is a broader concept
than the direct victim concept?
MR, HOWEs

When you talk of injury, you talk about

something that somebody has incurred as a result of a housing
discrimination.

Maybe that housing discrimination was not

directed at them, but they do sustain soma injuries,
QUESTION?
MR, EOWEs

Well, —
Whereas, with a right, we contend. Your

Honor, that that's individual
QUESTION?

I understand your argument.

But maybe

I'm just repeating what Mr, Justice Marshall asked, but is
there anything in the legislative history, the language of the
statute that you can point to that says there is this
distinction between direct victim and indirect victim?
MR, HOWEs

No, Your Honor, and we submit the reason

20

that w® can’t do that is because Congress never considered the
distinction between a direct and indirect victim, but rather
throughout the thread of the legislative history was that
they were talking about people who were barred access to
housing»

They were talking of direct victims»

I don’t think

you will find anywhere in the legislative history anything
which would indicate that an absent — that a party has a
right to assert rights of an absent third party6 in the
legislative history»
And also in the legislative history, the difference
between *»QUESTION*

W®11, if most of what they’re thinking

of is direct victims, then most applications of Sections
810 and 812 were expected to be alternative remedy applications?
MR» HOWE*
Honor»

Aa far as the direct victim, yes. Your

We concede that»
QUESTION*

Yes»

Well, the most that they ever

thought about it»
MR» HOWE*

That is correct, Your Honor»

QUESTION*

There’s nothing to indicate that they

thought about this narrow category of indirect victims that
could sue under on® section arid not the other»
V

MR» HOWE:
correct»

That is correct, Your Honor»

That is

Until the decision of this Court in Trafficante,

which extended the concept of person aggrieved»

21
QUESTIONs

I see»

MRo HOWE:

But prior to that, there's nothing in the

legislative history at all which x^ould support any finding
that the concept of an indirect victim was to have any kind of
rights under either 810 or 8120
And I think that -QUESTIONi
Trafficanta

Which suggests that, if you're right,

was wrong»

MRo HOWE*

Your Honor, that’s not a decision that

has to be reached by this Court0

I think that the legislative

history, while not addressing it, but by using that term
"person aggrieved" in 810, that you could sustain the decision
that you reached in Trafficanta»
Personally, wa might take a different position than
that, but I think that as far as the decision of tills Court
ia Trafficante, in construing the traditional concept of
"person aggrieved"
QUESTION}

But in so far as the silence of Congress

is concerned about indirect victims, it’s no more meaningful
her© than it was in Trafficante, I would think»
MR» HOWE:

I would concur that the silence of

Congress and as Mr» Justice Douglas suggested, the legislative
history of the Fair Housing Act is of very little help in
trying to interpret what the Act was intended to cover»
I think that the impact of Congress, again looking

22
at the basic statutory scheme* shows that under 3610 that the
concept was of having some kind of ameliorating process* of
requiring a person to file a complaint with the Secretary of
HUD* to have 30 days for conciliation,, and if there were State
or local agencies which had substantially equivalent remedies
and rights* that there should be a deferral to
local governments®

the State and

So that there could be a conservation of

judicial time* that those people who were perhaps in a broader
position than those who would be having their rights infringed
under 3612 would first go through that administrative process0
Because 3612 has no preconditions to invoking federal
jurisdiction* and wa would consider that part of the pattern
again* the intention of Congress was to provide these two
vehicles for enforcements

one* of a less adversary context

under 3610* with a broader spectrum of individuals who could
bring a complaint under 3610* and that they could also do that
without having to go into a court for purposes of achieving
their rights«
QUESTIONS

You don’t think that under that

Tra£ficanta indicated that the people who had exhausted 'their
administrative remedies could then sue tinder 812?
MR® HOWE:

No* Your Honor* I don’t think we can

construe it that way because it provides specifically in 810
how a person may go to court after having instituted the
process ©f filing their complaint with the Secretary* the

23
referral to a State agency, the unsatisfactory solution to
that problem„ and then allowing a person to go into a United
States District Court®

Well, I would suppose, if the Court was

right, it was saying that these very rights that were rejected

and that would include indirect purchases0
MR® HOWEs

We would disagree, Your Honor, on the basis

that in order for a person, first of all, wider Section 810 to
be able to proceed under 810, if they are a person aggrieved,
it's much broader®

The rights —»

QUESTION 2

Wall, never mind, I just wondered what

your position was0
MR® HOWE*

Basically it is that it would be the

individual rights, but that you could proceed, if you’re a
direct victim, under 810 or 812? indirect would only be able
to go through 810, and the action would be brought pursuant '
to 8!0O
QUESTIONS

Mr, Howe,

having in mind that there

appears to be considerable ambiguity, a question about it, how
much in th© scales should there be weighed the ultimate
objectives of the legislation as a whole?
MRo HOWEs

The preamble of the Fair Housing Act

states "as an objective of this country to provide for free
and open access to housing»*

As to how far the scales should

26

be weighed or challenged or changed, I think that with the
statutory scheme ©s it presently is set forth, with allowing
an indirect victim who meets the standing requirements as set
forth in the Trafficante decision to proceed under 810 , gives
relief to those indirect victims, whereas we reserve in 812
the opportunity to those people who suffer an immediate and
direct violation of their rights under Section 3604 to
immediately have access to a federal courtQ

If they need an

injunction to stop the sale of property, which they have had
an interest in and have been deprived of because of some kind
of discriminatory act, then I think we have protected the
interest of those people who suffer a direct and immediate
injury by letting them go immediately into federal court»
Whereas those who may have a broader spectrum of a
complaint, they may go through the administrative process,
it allows for fch&t amelioration, it allows for that
conciliation, and many times may result in a remedy which would
be far better than a remedy that might be obtained in court»
And we would suggest, Your Honor, that the two
sections ar® not alternatives»

Because if we are to treat them

as alternatives and you allow a person to immediately go
to 3612 who is an indirect victim, you dislocate the whole
administrative scheme»

And I think also because the reference

in 810 to State and local governmental bodies and their
ability to promulgate fair housing laws, that this would

27
destroy the incentive for them to go forwards

Because if

everything is going to be decided in a federal district court,
then what should they do,, or why should they proceed?
The schema of Congress was to share that responsibility
with the State and local governments, and, in fact, during the
debate —

there any inference to be drawn from that?

that they assert are rights that simply are not created by

that they say were infringed was racial steering against

MRo HOWE?

Righto
~ that as a result of that steering

against those third parties, which would be made unlawful
under 3604, they suffered injury because they have been
deprived of that right to live in an integrated community,,
QUESTION?

Do you think Trafficants helps you very

much on that?
MRo HOWE?

Well, I think the concept

of

Trafficante

does show that this Court did consider Section 810 to confer
broad standing of the person aggrieved concepto

And we would

suggest to the Court that its absence of any "person
aggrieved*5 language in Section 812, this Court should not
imply "person aggrieved*5 in Section 8120

If there is to be

broader jurisdiction under Section 812, it should be Congress
and not the Court that grants it by virtue of letting Congress
put in the term of art, "person aggrieved*", if that is their
intention, to allow direct access to indirect victims of
racial discrimination

Mr* Caruso*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF Fo WILLIS CARUSO, ESQ* ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR* CARUSO §

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Wa would like to eovar four main topics in our
discussionc
First, that the individuals here, the individual
homeowners, are very much individual people who have been
injured and are being injured? and it is an immediate injury0
Secondly, that the Village is suing to protect the
village fisc, and that is an immediate and a very much felt
injury right new?
Third, that the legislative history shows that these
two sections, 3610 and 3612, are alternative methods of
enforcements
And, finally, that Trafficanta is very applicable to
this situation, and that the injury here indicates an even
more stronger situation of injury to individuals in taking
away rights guaranteed under 3604c
The homeowners, Mr» Powell and the others ~ Mr*
Powell happens to be white *=-> found that there was steering
going on in the Village of Hailwood, and that the impact was

31

to create fear and problems * and so they tried to do something
about it»

And Mr» Powell wanted to live in Bellwood* in an

integrated society* in integrated schools* in a normal* stable
kind of situation* and h© wanted to do something about it* so
he went to the Village and he went to the Leadership Council*
the fair housing group in Chicago* to work on this»
Miss Perry is black * and she lives in Bellwood* and
she wanted to continue to live in this community which was a
normal* integrated community* and she wanted it to stay that
way* where her children could live and deal with people of
the same kind of living situation on the normal basis? and
have a healthy real estate market* free from fear and constant
pressure by the real estate community»
At the same time* the Village here received complaints *
both the Mayor's office and the police department* of real
estate people cut steering in the neighborhood and creating
fear and problems among the people in the community»

And the

Village Board voted to ask for help from a fair housing
organisation* the Leadership Council»
Some of the plaintiffs and other people then went
out to find out what the practices were»

What they found out

was that when a white person went in and asked for a certain
kind of housing and a certain value* they were sent to
certain areas considered to be protected and set aside for
whites»

Whan blacks want out and gave the same kind of

32
information, BWe want a $45,000 house” or whatever the figure
was, so many bedrooms and bo forth, they were steered mainly
to two particular areas, where they were trying to change the
area from white to black0
The Village, after seeing this information from the
audits, both from people who are plaintiffs in this case as
well as other testers or auditors or investigators, or whatever
they may be called, the Village then voted to take action in
the federal district court and requested again assistance in
filing that case in the federal district court.
They sought direct relief under 3612, and this was
an immediate problem, this was something that had to be solved
quickly, and it was something that had to be done and get
into court right away»

And they sought that 3612 remedy because,

among other things, under 3614 there is a provision that these
cases are supposed to be expedited? and in many cases they are.
Defendants here acknowledge that there is a violation
of 3604(a), and that they think that a plaintiff, a person who
is affected by a violation of the Fair Housing Act, must,
under these circumstances, go through the route of going to
KUD and the administrativa process, and only after that could
they sue9
That seems to indicate that they see, and in fact they
say they see a system hare0

Well, clearly, if the Congress

meant to have that kind of e system, they could have followed

33

the Title VII approach, and they didn’t do that»

Congress

knew how to make that exhaustion necessary, and they didn’t
do it®
The legislative history —
QUESTIONS
this®

Let me test out how far you would carry

Suppose someone living in Springfield or Peoria came

in and said, in a complaint, alleged that they didn’t like the
kind of life they had wherever it was they were living, and
they wanted to move into a totally integrated community, and
they were thinking about coming into this particular complex,
but this situation that has been described in the pleadings
existed, and therefore they bring a suit under 3612 in
federal court immediately®
What would you say about that?
MR® CARUSOs

Well, I think that this case does not

extend anywhere near that far —» anywhere near that far®
QUESTIONS

I'm just trying to see how long the arm

is, how far you would carry it®
MR® CARUSOs

All right®

The first thing is that

.in the complaint the area involved is specifically delineated
by streets, a very specific area where this steering activity
was taking place is delineated, it starts from there®
QUESTIONS

Well, I'm assuming in my hypothetical

that that's the same®
MR® CARUSOs

And the people involved suing here

34
are the Village itself, where this area is all included
within the Village, and the people who live in tie community,
all but on® of whom live right in the municipalitya

Miss Sharp

lives in Maywood, which is a budding community, subject to
the same kind of problems and in the same marketplace,,
QUESTIONs

Do they need to live in the same community

to gat relief?
MR® CARUSO*

I think as a practical matter the

experience is, and it seems that the experience would be, and
the violation in th© future would be, people living either in
that community or very close bya

Because they are affected by

the damage that we allege, the manipulation of the marketplace,,
Now, it could be —» I don't think it extends to
Springfield, Your Honor, because I don’t think that the market*»
place extends to Spring-field»

But the marketplace under some

circumstances might include two or three communities all being
subject to a steering practice»
QUESTION *

The fact is that the Trafficante

opinion in at least two places during the course of the opinion
emphasized that the plaintiffs were occupants of a precise and
limited apartment complex, doesn't it?
MR» CARUSO*

Yes, it does»

I think that in this instance «*»
QUESTIONt

At least one of those references would

seem to pretty clearly limit the standing in that case to

35

people so situated®

Wouldn’t you agree?

MR® CARUSO i
and would be limited®

I would agree that it is very limited
1 clearly would not include Springfield,

and if, as we move in from Springfield, I think it would not
include a lot of other things®

But I would say that from

experience the real estate marketplace extends beyond sometimes
a specific community and that is —
QUESTION g

There were 8200 people in the Trafficante

apartment complex, hew many people are there in Be11wood?
MR® CARUSOs
Your Honor®

There ware about 22,000 at this time,

And Bellwood, interestingly enough, was a very

built-up community®

I mean, it was

&

community which

developed kind of the? same kind of time and a lot of people
of the same kind of background, same kind of homes, who had
lived there for quit© soma time®

It had a lot of the indices

of a very closs-knit community, with people of similar interests
and similar backgrounds®
QUESTION?

You would agree, wouldn’t you, Mr® Caruso,

that you have to go beyond the holding in Trafficante in
order to sustain your position, because of the fact that the
plaintiffs in Trafficante were tenants or occupants of the
apartment complex in question?
MR® CARUSO *

I think that the case is different

than Trafficante in that respect? that Trafficante was a
particular apartment complex, although a very, vary big one®

36
And Bellwood is differant because it is homeowners, it is a
community itself, and it is different because the Village is
involved trying to protect the value of the homes from being
depreciated by this process and thereby limiting the tax base®
So there are those differences®
it seems to m© there is on© thing that is stronger
her©, and that is that these homeowners are being damaged
directly by an attempt to change the process, in other words,
to change it from an integrated community to an all^black
community®

And it seems to me that that is even a stronger

injury than the situation where in Trafficante they were trying
to keap blacks out, and the whites wanted to make it an open
community®
Here the community and the municipality have worked
to make it an open community® And, as a result of that, the
real ©state industry now is trying to turn on them and change
it to an all“black segregated community®
little stronger in that regard®

So I think it's a

But it is broader than

Trafficante, it includas more people®
QUESTIONS

But even if Trafficante has limits,

which it certainly does, and even if this exceeds those limits,
that’s a long ways from taking the position that only direct
purchasers have a cause of action under 3612®
MR® CA.RUSOs

The position that only direct

purchasers would have a cause of action doesn’t seem to follow

3?
anything in tha Act or any of the existing decisions,

And

particularly in looking at 3604, for exanple, on advertising,
clearly the people have to bring a suit to prevent that kind of
advertising, 3604(c) and 3604(a), among other things, contem­
plate the kind of action that is set forth here»
And, in addition, all of the district courts and
Courts of Appeals — most of the Courts of Appeals have dealt
with situations where many different kinds of parties have been
allowed standing under 3612 when there has been an injury as
a result of a violation of the Fair Housing Act,
The legislative history, as indicated previously in
soma discussion on questions, and the Dirksen involvement in
that indicates that 3612 was meant to be a strong enforcement
tool,
And it is in fact necessary to make this Fair Housing
Law work,

HUD is very busy, and HUD is doing more and more.

But it is important and the legislative history indicates
that it was intended that individual people, local people
like the people in this community, would have a right to act,
to work togs the 2: to try to protect their community and do
something about a problem that, they see as being very important,
Wa think that the situation here presented represents
individuals and a municipality who are directly injured,
who have -*«» need the activity here locally to protect their
community and to try to maintain a healthy, viable local

38
community»
That the legislative history supports the position
that these two acts should be enforced separately and
concurrently# as necessary# along with other ways of enforcing
these laws as necessary# and that the case should be allowed
to go forward# and that the proof should be allowed to come
in# and that the plaintiffs should be allowed to show these
steering practices# to show what these realtors do to try to
change the neighborhoods# with all of the things that can
result from that# like the problems with the school segregation
and so forth»

If these communities can be kept integrated#

then healthy schools can be maintained# the other problems of
segregation can be helped and prevented by integrated
communities e
tod v;e respectfully request that the plaintiffs here
be allowed to proceed to show these violations, to present the
the
evidence# to do/disc©very# and to proceed x^ith this case0
I would like# with the indulgence of the Court# to
pass on what remaining time I may have to the United States,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G0 WALLACE e ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE?

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The first thing I want to emphasize about this case
is that contrary to some impressions that some may have of it,
it is not, in our view, a case shout whether testers have
standing to sue under Section 812.

Testers do provide important

evidence, particularly in racial steering cases.

It's very

difficult to prove racial steering in our experience? and,
in the absence of evidence of this kind, occasionally you can
gat evidence from a former employee of the company.
But, by and larges, this has been the most probative
kind of evidence in steering cases. But it's just coincidental
that the complainants in this case also happen to be the
r

witnesses, the potential witnesses who have been doing the
testing.
Their interest here is an interest in the way their
community has been affected by the cumulative effects of the
steering practices.

And it's in its cumulative effects that

the steering practices have their pernicious effects on the
community.
In so far as the statute deals with steering, its
focus is not really as an antifraud provision, about a
particular individual.

Very often the individual who has bean

40

steered^ who is a willing purchaser of a home or renter, is
quite satisfied with the property that he has settled into»
It’s the cumulative effect that causes the injury to the
community and the people living in the community»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Wallace, --

QUESTIONS

What substantive rights ~ oh, excuse ms,

QUESTIONS

— the government's brief, on page 6,

in its introduction and summary of the argument, says, "We
submit that the individual respondents have standing to
challenge petitioners8 racial steering practices under the
Fair Housing Act»"
Now, as I understand the Court of Appeals opinion,
if held that both the city and the individual respondents have
standing»

Does the government take a position on the

standing of tbs city?
MR» WALLACE s We have not taken a position in our
brief, Mr» Justice Rehnquisfe, but we have no disagreement with
the opinion of the Court of Appeals on this subject? and,
indeed, HUD has entertained complaints from municipal
corporations similarly situated, and initiated investigations,
in response to such complaints»
So while w© didn't brief the question, because wa
thought that the case was pretty clearly controlled by
Trafficante with respect to the individual complainants, we
have no disagreement with the holding of the Court of Appeals,

41
or indeed with any aspect of Judge Powell's opinion,,

We think

it's a fine opinion«
QUESTION?

My question, Mr0 Wallace, is simply tillss

Let ma begin by expressing my understanding with which I will
ask you if you agree, that up until the enactment of this
federal legislation, so far as federal statutory law went ■—
forgetting for a moment 1982 <■»«■ there was nothing wrong about
racial steering, so far as federal statutory law went®
Therefore, any rights that are asserted by the
plaintiffs in this case have to ba based upon this statute*
Limiting again, forgetting the constitution of 1982*
substantive rights are these plaintiffs asserting?

What
Those

created by 3602 or 3 or 4 or what?
MR» WALLACE^
of Title VIIIo

3604(a)

It’s 3604, what we call Section 804
It's set forth quite completely in

*

the brief for the petitioners*
QUESTIONS

Y@Bo

MR* WALLACES

And our theory right along, and we've

brought about 80 cases of our own in the course of the Act,
alleging racial steering of one kind or another, has been that
it's a violation of that portion of 3604(a) which refers to
"or otherwise made unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any
person"»

The first part of 3604(a), which includes the

qualification of the bona fide offer, *~
QUESTION s

Right

42
MR* WALLACE **— focuses on a violation by the seller
himself, or the renter himself* And they wanted to afford the
protection, to make sure there was a bona fide offer made to
that individual in many instances, rather than a company
engaged in the business, before there would be a violation of
that kind*
But the remainder obviously has principal reference
to people engaged in the real ©state business or to big
renters of property end the like*
QUESTIONs

Well, have any of these plaintiffs been

rendered unavailable to housing as a result of the actions
of these defendants?
MR® WALLACE?

No, there, as I look at it, as we

look at the rights that they are asserting under the statute,
it’s not a right,as counsel for the petitioners has expressed it,
to live in an integrated society®

Congress couldn’t

guarantee that*
QUESTIONS

No®

MR® WALLACE*

Arsd didn’t purport to guarantee that*

But it's a right not to be injured by the effect of practices
that ar© proscribed under the statute®

And it’s a right not

to be affected by the racial steering that the statute
prohibits®
It’s very similar to the right assarted by the
plaintiffs in the Trafficante case®

There was, as the Court

43
noted in its opinion in Traff 1cante , considerable focus in tha
legislative history on the dangers to the community of
discriminatory practices in housing, and the benefits to all
members of the community of adherence to the requirements that
were being proposed in the Fair Housing Acto
And one of the telling things about steering casas,
and we reviewed every decided case yesterday rather hastily,
©very decided case under Title VIII0

One of the telling things

is that w© didn't find a single instance of a case in which an
individual had sued solely because he had been steered and
claimed an injury as a result of fehate
Thar® were a few casas in which an individual claimed
that he was illegally denied access to a particular house that
he wanted to buy or a particular apartment that he wanted to go
into, and was seeking that, and additionally alleged that
there was steering dcna0
QUESTIONz
MR0 WALLACE 8

But —

Well, that's a result of steering^
That could be a result of steering,

but if —
QUESTIONS

Yes0

That is the hoped-for result of

Often the result is that he was

h© never knew about tha other, and wasn't trying to get into
the other

44
QUESTION8

Not that it matters in this case, but

what9a the difference between this and "red lining*3?
MR® WALLACES

Red lining is usually used in reference

to credit practices by lending institutions, in areas like —

Wall, it's landing on property, though,,

HR0 WALLACES

Yes, that’s righto

In areas where it’s

QUESTIONs

Well, here they had lines, without saying

whether they were rad or blue»
MRo WALLACES

Don’t they?

Well, here there were areas where

steering of customers by the real astata companies, that was
done on the basis of race0
QUESTION*

No, I didn’t use the words "black and

white" in this instance0
MRo WALLACES

But what we have found is that the

cases where private suits have bean brought alleging steering,
and attempting to enjoin steering, or claiming damages from
steering, have typically been cases by community fair housing
organizations, where the plaintiffs would be a number of
individuals who banded together because of the effects the
steering had had on their community,, And it may well be that
some of these plaintiffs have actually dealt with these
companies and been steered themselves; but you don’t ordin™
arily see that alleged in the complaint, because it’s very
difficult for them to prove what was available that they were

45
not showno
In the absence of the feasting evidence, which is
something gathered separately — in other words, if you have
someone who was himself a victim of steering as a plaintiff
in one of these cases, it’s more or less coincidental and it's
his similarity to the other plaintiffs that we have in this
case that is his real motivation for being a plaintiff, rather
than the difference which he doesn't even allege typically0
So that tell us something about what it is that's
the incentive to sue here, and that has something to do with
/

realistically where the standing should be recognized,,
QUESTIONs
you»

Just let me be sure I fully understand

That the plaintiffs* entire substantive claim,

substantive statutory claim — forgetting again about 1982 —
is based upon the second half of 3604(a), beginning wor
otherwise) made unavailable"«
MR* WALLACE?

Is that correct?

Well, that is our theory that we’ve

operated on about where steering is proscribed in the statute„
QUESTIONS

Yes»

And what the injury is to these

plaintiffs»
MRa WALLACE?

Yes»

No, there are other provisions

there that some have looked toward in the literature as
bearing on the steering question»
QUESTIONS

Yes, but I'm asking you, what you —

MRe WALLACE? Well, we relied on 3604(a) and no court

46

has ever expressed doubt that steering is prohibited by the
statute»
QUESTIONS

Well, surely, I think that's been conceded

by! your brother»
MR» WALLACE s

Yes, it has been conceded for purposes

of this case»
QUESTIONS

Yes»

MR» WALLACES

So we're dealing here with the

typical, the typical kind of private complainant about
racial steering, and the injury that is typically alleged in
a racial steering case»

And I think that is of some importance,

in concomitance with the concerns that ware being expressed in
Congress about the community interest that would be served by
this legislation»
Now, as a matter of feet, as Mr» Justice White was
suggesting earlier in the argument, there were claims made
under Section 812 in Traffieante, which is the section that
the suit is being brought under here, and indeed there were
complainants in Trafficante, complainants in intervention,
who had not exhausted their administrative remedies with HUD,
who had not complained to HUD at all»
And the sole basis for their suit in intervention
was Section 812«

And there is significance, in our view,

to the statement that he quoted from page 409 of the opinion,
that individuals could sue directly under Section 812, because

47
those were among the complainants who were seeking not only
injunctive relief; but they often made damage claims0

And

on remand the case was settled, but the district court and
everyone else thought that their claim had been upheld along
with the claims of the two tenants who had first gone to HUD
and were suing under Section 8100
QUESTIONS Well, do you understand the challenge here
to be a case or controversy challenge?
MRe WALLACE?
QUESTION:

Wall, there has bean —
Solely or what?

MRo WALLACE:

I don't think it's solely, I think

there is an argument being made under Article III in the
petitioners* brief»

It seems to ra© that that challenge is

largely foreclosed by the decision in TraffjLcanfce, and that
if there is an open question here, it's a statutory question0
Thaso people are directly affected in much the same
way as the complainants in Trafficante»
QUESTION:

The statutory question in the sense that

even if there's a case or controversy, Congress didn't intend
this particular kind, this class of person to have the right
to get into courfcc

Even if he could get into court under 810a

MRo WALLACE:

That, it seems to me, that would be

I agree with that formulation,

Mr, Wallace, to get bade to 3604, which

is apparently the — (a) , which you say is the substantive
— the source of the substantive right.

It reads, "To refuse

to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to
refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise
made unabailable”0

You do not read the subsequent clause as

after "refuse to sell or rent after th® making of a bona fide
offer” as having required a bona fide offer?
MR, WALLACEz

Not at all.

Not at all, Mr0 Justice

Rehnquisfco
The motivation behind patting in the bona fide
offer requirement, as it’s recounted in petitioners' brief,
focused on the liability of the particular seller or renter0
And there was resistance to making him liable in the absence
of a bona fide offer, and the language was carefully placed
in the statute.

There was no concern about the practices of

real estate companies that wouldn't even tell people about

In spite of Congress's concern for

MRe WALLACE:

They were concerned that someone

should not be claimed to have refused to sell to someone
because of his race if that person wasn’t a good-»faith
purchaser who made a bona fide offer»
But if tha seller was going to refuse to even show
the property or talk to anyone, you know, the concern didn’t
carry over.
Of course, it’s not a question in this case»

I

think it’s clear from the statutory language that the bona

sell? it’s that plain„
QUESTION?

And not to negotiate0

MRe WALLACES

Well, that’s right»

I think if you

refused to even talk to someone about what’s available, it's
a violation of the statute as we view it»

But that isn’t

ordinarily the form that violations take»
I mean, it’s really unreasonable to expect a bona

refusal to negotiate»
It’s the sensible way to read the statute»
QUESTION:

Mr» Wallace, is there any cause of action

that may be brought under the Act, under Section 3610, requir­
ing exhaustion of administrative remedies?

50

In other words, does the option always prevail with
respect to every cause of action under the Fair Housing Act ,
to go directly to 3612?

QUESTION?

What are the advantages to using 3610?

MR® WALLACE ?

There are great advantages, and they

©re the ones that Congress actually anticipated in providing
this as an alternative remedy, and that is, that many matters
are informally settled without the expense of litigation
through the good offices of HUD, through the conciliation
process®

HUD is now getting about 3800 complaints per year®

A far greater number than are submitted to the courts®

And

many of them are quite expeditiously, finally resolved, not
only in favor of —

It's

And they did a computer rundown for us this

week of their dispositions between October of 1976 and May of
1978, and more than half of the complaints were finally

51
disposed of within 120 days during that periodo
There were —*• lic2 percent were finally disposed of
within 30 days* And another 17a2 percent in 30 to SO days?
16«2 percent in 60 to 90 days, and so on? 1308 percent in 91
to 120 days»
So many of fcha complaints can expeditiously be
disposed ofo
As we point out in our brief, it has been HUD's
consistent interpretation of the statute that the alternative
remedies are available for any person aggrieved within the
meaning of 810«

And at every step in the process there are

notifications to individuals who have complained to them which
include a statement that they have a right to sue under
Section 812„
And indeed there is much in the legislative evolution
of the two provisions which suggest that this is righto
All of the resistance to the Fair Housing lagisla~
tion

and there was a great deal of resistance *»» on© of the

main focal points was on the idee of the federal bureaucrats
becoming involved,, And indeed the deferral, the main motivation
behind the deferral that was required to local fair housing
officials was that the federal bureaucracy shouldn9t be
interfering in areas where local conciliation and mediation
efforts are available»
Which suggests that, quite the opposite of what is

52
being argued today, that the deferral should take place in
the absence of HUD'a involvement rather than as the statute
focuses it in the presence of HUD’s involvement? it is HUD
itself that is supposed to defer to these processes,,
And in looking again at the legislative history,
the immediate evolution of 812 is connected with this, and it
was recounted in some detail in our brief in the Trafficante
case, which I re-read yesterday, and I regret to say some of
th© pertinent portions of th© legislative history ware not
reproduced in any of the briefs in the present case? but they
can ba found in our brief in the Trafficante case»
And I would like to just mention rather briefly some
of those pertinent aspects of it, in addition to the ones that
we have cited in

our present brief»

QUESTION3

It sounds like you were prepared like the

witness yesterday»
MR» WALLACE %

[Laughing]»

Well, we did recount

there in some rather lengthy textual footnotes the immediate
derivation of Section 812» And this is principally in Footnote
8 of that brief and in Footnote 12 of that brief»
In Footnoe 8 we pointed out that Section 810 itself

53
was derived from section 11 of a bill which Senator Mondale
had offered as an amendment to a House bill.

The House bill

that cams over at this time, in 1968 — this is after two
years of previous history that, we recounted in some detail in
our present brief — the bill that came over at that time
from the House did not include any fair housing provisions at
all.
And Senator Mondale offered as an amendment a bill
that included a provision similar to Section 810, but it also
included authority for HUD to issue caasa and desist orders
that would be enforcibl© in court.

And it was the cease and

desist authority, something similar to the way the National
Labor Relations Board operates, that v?as the focal point of
controversy, and that resulted in the failure of a number of
cloture motions, which we have recounted in that Footnote 8.
And at that point, after these cloture motions had
failed, Senator Monds,la moved to table his proposed amendment
and supported a substitute amendment offered by Senator
Dirkaen, which is the one that was adopted and later was
adopted by the House.
And this retained the» Section 810 mechanism for
making an administrative complaint, but took the authority to
issue cease and desist orders away from HUD, and, in its place,
substituted Section 812, an alternative to go directly into
State or federal court

54

tod as w© argued then in our Footnote 12 in that
brief, because there were, after all, two complainants in that
case who were complaining only under Section 812, there's no
reason to think that the failure to repeat the definition of
"parson aggrieved" in Section 812 made any change in the class
of complainants who were authorized to pursue either remedy
because Section 812 was designed as a substitute for the
cease and desist remedy that had originally been proposed for
the class of persons aggrieved, defined in what had been
Section 11 of Senator Mondale’a bill3
There was nothing in this immediate evolution of the
alternative remedy that suggeste any notion of a different
class of complainants»

It was a way to ameliorate the

objections to a federal administrative remedy for the class
of complainants that both proposals were designed to give a
right of action to0
tod so the additional aspects of the legislative
history, which we've recounted in our present brief, indicate
that the rationale hypothesized by the Ninth Circuit «— and
it was entirely hypothesized, there were no references at all
to the legislative history in the TOPIC opinion

that those

do not comport at all with the actual evolution of the
provisions at issue or the congressional intention which was,
as had been the) practice, that it’s really the administrative
remedy that provides the inexpensive, quick road to relief

55
in many instances 0

And the judicial remedy was not reserved

for a special class of cases that had to be more expeditiously
handledo
Our experience is that the hoped-for expedition in
Section 812 and Section 813 cases often doesn't coma to pass0
And so we really think that this case is# in every
pertinent respect,, no different from Traffleanfee„

It*s true

that you have a wider geographic area that -these people are
concerned about0

They don't happen to be people living in an

apartment complex# they are living in a suburban community„
But they# too# are protected by the intent of Congress and by
the protections of the Act*
And as Judge Stern# I think vary eloquently# stated
in a case in New Jersey that's cited in the brief# Fair Housing
Council v. Eastern Bergen County # the fact that the alleged
injury# and I'm quoting from Judge Stern now#"affects a large
nurabar of people in a larg€* geographic area does not serve to
attenuate it# on the contrary it makes the harm more severe,.
Residents of an all-white housing complex may need only to
look to the next residential facility for the inter-racial
associations they desire# if the allegations here are true#
residents of Bergen County may have to go to an entirely
different neighborhood or community0
"Similarly a completely white building is less of a
ghetto than a completely white neighborhood or community,,

56
That the cordon sanitaire has been drawn around an entire
community rather than a single apartment complex does not
render it lawful#"

say, "I'm uncomfortable living in a State where there are any

QUESTION*

Well, I'm hurt by it®

MR® WALLACE*

I say I’m hurt®

Well, the question is whether the

way they have to live is affected by unlawful practices of
someone els©? that Congress has proscribed? and that they are
complaining of®

Not whether their feelings are hurt because

the law isn't being observed by everyone in the country or in
their State®
It's always difficult to formulate these things
with exactitude®

I can tell you that HUD does not undertake

investigations at the behest of the people who don't in some
way allege that they are affected®
QUESTION*

For example, —-

Economically affected or how affected?

MR® WALLACE*

No, they don't require a pleading the

way a court might, but, for example, if they get a complaint
from a former employee of a real estate company that the
company was engaging in steering practices, and that employee
does not in any way say that he's still in that community and
is affected by those practices®

HUD does not initiate an

QUESTIONt

Mr® Wallace, on this question of the scope

of Trafficante, you know, apparently Bellwood has some 20 or
25 thousand people compared to 8200 in Trafficante®

But then

I just recalled that the complaint actually concerns a limited
area within Bellwood, doesn't it?

Well, they —

Or does that go across into Maywood?

I'm

not sure®
MR® WALLACES

They specified a limited area to which

black customers were being steered® That was part of the
specificity of the complaint®

Eut I don't think the complaint

specified that as the only area affected by this hearing®

for purposes of comparison, is the population of Bellwood?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN T0 HOWE , ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR© HOWE:

Yes©

May It please the Court?

Much has been said about the Trafficante decision
in this argument, so I think the Court's attention should be
directed to page 212 of the opinion, wherein the Court stated,
wW® reverse and remand the case to the district court, leaving
untouched all other questions,”
I think this follows right after the statement by Mr,
Justice Douglas, stating, ,sWe can give vitality to Section 810
Ca) only by a generous construction,M
So I think that all other questions in Trafficanfee
were reserved and untouched by this Court,
One other factual -»

Of course, the Court left open the 1982

question, didn’t it?
MR, HOWEs

That is correct also, Your Honor,

QUESTIONS
MR, HOWE s

It did not mention it in the footnote that

it dealt with in 1982, but it did in this language at the end,
and then taking your concurring opinion too, Mr, Justice
White, wherein you stated that you would limit it to the facts
of the case presented.
One other fact which is extremely important in the
Trafficante decision is that the action was brought against a

of BaXlwood itself have a dramatic impact upon housing patterns
within Bellwoodc
QUESTIONi

Well, that would almost go to the merits

of the ease»
MRo HOWEs

It could, Your Honor, but I think that

the fact that we'd like to point, out is ‘that there is a dis™
tinction between the class of defendants in Traffi.cante as to
the class of defendants in this particular case»
The concept of the public policy argument, as advanced
by tha United States, no showing has been made that by opening
an opportunity under Section 3(512 to indirect victims, that
the policy of the Fair Housing Act would be advanced»
And we would submit that it would be to the contrary,
because

it would provide a mechanism by which the entire

matrix of an administrative remedy through Section 3610
could be avoided and circumvented,,
We think that the language of Section 3610 of “person
aggrieved*’ is unique, and the failure of Congress to include
that language specifically in Section 3612 indicated a
differing view by Congress»

And we need only look at the

natural meaning of the words contained in the statute to go
forward with that

62

The fact that the Attorney General’s office lacks
staff is no reason for this Court to make any consideration as
to how it is going to interpret a statute»

It must do that

solely and exclusively on the basis of what is contained in the
statute®
Wa submit that we know of no other statute in the
United States that would allow the systematic circumvention of
remedyp if this Court is to adopt the position that has been
advanced by the plaintiffs®

It is necessary to confine an

actionable claim within the limits of the language used by
Congress„ and consistent with the logic that’s embodied in
that statutory schemef rather than allowing it to extend
beyond the intentions of Congress®
