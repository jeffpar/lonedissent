MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments next

in No. 77-1248,, Illinois State Board of Elections against
Socialist Workers Party et al.
Mr. Levinson, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. LEVINSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LEVINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arises as a result of a special mayoral
election held in the city of Chicago on June 7th, 1977.
The plaintiffs, appellees, alleged 10-2 and 10-3 of
Chapter 46, Illinois Revised States? unconstitutionally deprive
them of their equal protection of the laws.
In this case they required, due to the 5 percent
minimum signature requirement, to obtain approximately 36,000
signatures while statewide car,didates, independent, new
political party candidates running for state office, need only
25,000 signatures.
The trial court below issued a permanent injunction
against requiring more than 25,000 signatures for all future
elections.

The court of appeals affirmed the district court's

opinion.
Notwithstanding the objection of the appellant,
during the course of the proceedings, the U.S. Labor Party

4
entered into a private agreement with the Chicago Board of
Elections Commissioners to further lower the signature
requirements from 25,000 to 20,000, and to extend the filing
period from 64 days before the election to 50 days before the
election.
The court of appeals declined to resolve this latter
issue on the grounds of mootness.
Appellant submits that, at its threshold, this case
present serious threats to the viability of three established
doctrines of this Court, stares decisis, summary affirmance
and mootness.
With respect to summary — I'm sorry.

With respect

to stare decisis, appellant submits that the issues involved in
this appeal, namely, the discrepancy between 25,000 signatures
required for independent and new political party candidates
running statewide and the 5 percent signature requirement
for all other offices in the state was presented in the
jurisdictional statement in Jackson v. Ogilvie.
It was present to this Court.

And we have at issue

the same statute which was challenged in Jackson v. Ogilvie.
We have the same defendant, which was sued in Jackson v. Ogilvie.
We have the same office being sought, which is mayor.
And in essence we argue that the same statute is
again being relitigated.

We argue in our briefs that the

principle of stare decisis, and the interests of uniformity

5
and predictability should have guided the lower courts into
affirming the constitutionality of that statute.
We also suggest that the law of the case, although
not on all fours necessarily, with thise case should be expanded
to include a situation where an identical statute is being
challenged and, in effect, we maintain the same script is being
presented.

The actors are different but the roles are the

same.
We have an independent candidate running for mayor
in the city of Chicago.
QUESTION?

Was the case you’re referring to a

summary affirmance here?
MR. LEVINSON;
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

And we’ve said, haven't we, that our

summary affirmances are in our own jurisprudence entitled to
less weight than a fully written out opinion for the Court?
MR. LEVINSON;

No, sir.

I do not construe that.

I have — in this Court I have construed that
summary affirmances have precedential value in that —
QUESTION:

They do.

All I'm suggesting is that

whereas in Hicks against Miranda I think we said that they were
binding on lower courts, lower federal courts.

In cases like

Sdelman against Jordan we’ve said they were entitled to some
weight but not the same weight that a fully written out
opinion would be.

6

MR. LEVINSON:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, as I understand

it, or as appellant is maintaining, that perhaps the ratio
decidendi,

or the rule of law which is to be gleaned from a

summary affirmance is very diffucult in the absence of an
opinion.
But as Justice White stated in Hicks v. Miranda,
votes to affirm summarily and to dismiss for want of
substantial federal question — it hardly needs comment -- are
votes on the merits of the case.
Lower courts are bound by summary decisions by
this Court until such time as the Court informs them that they
are not.
QUESTION!

But you

don9t you at least agree

that prior summary actions are not entitled to the same
weight here, in this Court?
MR. LEVINSON:
QUESTION:

In this Court, yes, sir.

In other words, even though the lower

court —
MR. LEVINSONs
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

-- under Hicks is bound by it, when it

|?ets here —
MR. LEVINSON:
QUESTION:

— we car, ignore it.

MR. LEVINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Hopefully not.

But we can.

7
MR. LEVINSON:
QUESTION:
about words.

Yes, you can.

Of course you can,

Well, we can't ~ maybe we're quibbling

We probably can't ignore it.

We have to

mention it.
But it has, as brother Brennan suggests, less
precedential controlling weight here, in this Court.
MR. LEVINSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, in this Court, it does.

Than a fully developed court opinion

in a case would have.
MR. LEVINSON:

That's true.

For the appellees tc succeed in this case, appellants
submit, would require overturning the Jackson summary
affirmance.
QUESTION:

This is based not just on the fact that

it is not a fully developed opinion necessarily, but it's a
case that hasn't had plenary treatment with full briefing and
oral arguments.

And therefore, while we can ignore

theoretically any opinion of the Court, we give less weight
to the summary dispositions.
Isn't that the way you read Hlck3 v, Miranda?

We're

free to give less weight to it.
MR. LEVINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, as I read Hicks v,

Miranda and the Mandel decision, that there is less constraint
on this honorable Court to decide otherwise than were the
case to receive plenary consideration.

8

But notwithstanding that point, you have a quote
Mro Chief Justice Burger, and I'd like to read from the quote
in Torres v. New York State Department of Labor;

when we

summarily affirm without opinion the judgment of a three-judge
court, we affirm the judgment but not necessarily the
reasoning by which it was reached.
Therefore, what appellees are suggesting in this
case is that the summary affirmance was nothing more than an
adoption of the opinion of the lower court in Jackson v, Ogilvie.
What appellants are urging on this Court is that the
same issue which is being raised in this litigation was raised
in Jackson v, Ogilvie.
statement.

It's part of the jurisdictional

It's part of the appendix of the U.S. Labor Party's

brief.
Therefore, we could only assume that this Court
considered it when it summarily affirmed Jackson v. Ogilvie.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Levinson, would you help me on that

precise point?
You have said that the .same issue was raised, which
I take it means in the Jackson case there was an argument
that not only the 5 percent was unreasonable, but the fact
that the 5 percent in the city of Chicago produced a higher
number than the 25 percent-- 25,000 in other parts of the
state?
Was that precisely -

9
MR. LEVINSON;
QUESTION;

Yes it was, Mr. Justice —

You didn't quote that part in your brief.

You just quote language that refers to the fact that the
5 percent goes to 58,000.

You don't quote anything that

refers to discrepancies between 58,000 and 25,000.
MR. LEVINSON;

As I recall, Your Honor, in our briefs

we d© maintain that the issue was presented *—
QUESTION;

You say that, but you don't cite anything

in the jurisdictional statement that supports your statement.
That's what puszled me.
MR. LEVINSON;
QUESTION;

I think we cite it in the briefs.

What part of your brief?

MR. LEVINSON;

No, it was more than one sentence.

Although the lower court —
QUESTION;

The lower —• the district court here said

there was only one sentence, end it was only a passing
mention, wasn't discussed.
MR. LEVINSON;

That, with all due respect to the

lower court, I think that is not a totally accurate statement.
Because the later opinions of the court, he says, well, it
was mentioned in passing in the brief.

But attached is

Appendix D to the U.S. Labor Party's brief, is the memorandum
of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, and this
Court will note that it's
a significant argument.

It's

in this honorable Court, by virtue of the jurisdictional
statement.
Now, even were this Court —
QUESTION:

Mr. Levinson, it's really quite important

that I do know exactly what you rely on.
You rely on Appendix D to the Labor Department0 s
brief?
MR. LEVINSON:

Yes, sir.

Which was an argument made in the United

States District Court, as I understand it correctly.
MR. LEVINSON:

But this was a

Well, this Court cannot grant plenary

QUESTION:

Who advanced the argument in this Court

that your opponents now rely on?
MR. LEVINSON:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, Your Honor.

Who advanced the argument in this Court

11
in Jackson v, Ogilvie,
MR. LEVINSON:

that your opponents now rely on?
The appellants.

Jackson attacked a

memorandum of the attorney general to his jurisdictional
statement; because he —QUESTION:

Did he make the argument, other than

attaching a document that shows it was argued in the district
court?

Did he make the argument in this Court?
MR. LEVINSON:

Well, by attaching it to the

jurisdictional statement -QUESTION:

That’s the extent of the argument that

was made in the other case?
MR. LEVINSON:

Because no plenary consideration was

given.
QUESTION:

Well — all right.

MR. LEVINSON:

But that is —

Since) no plenary consideration was

given, the only way it could be presented to the Court —
QUESTION:

I suppose the argument could have been

advanced in the jurisdictional statement itself, and said,
we think the decision is wrong for this reason.
But that was not done, as I understand it.
MR. LEVINSON:

Well,, there was a cross-over.

It

is stated in the jurisdictional statement that we are attaching
the memorandum opinion of the attorney general.

And it's

incorporated within the jurisdictional statement.
attaches it as appendix B to :he Jackson v. Ogilvie

He

12
jurisdictional statement.

He says, for the reasons

-stated

therein, we are including that, as part of our argument.
So he is incorporating by reference the position of
the attorney general, i.e., the discrepancy between statewide
candidates and less-than-statewide candidates invidiously
discriminates in violate of equal protection.
It's very clear from the jurisdictional statement,
Your Honor.
QUESTION i

X just don't understand, if it's that

clear, why you didn't quote any of this in your brief.
I'll look at this jurisdictional statement —MR. LEVINSONs

Even if this Court were to conclude

that the Jackson and Jennes3 decisions were not controlling,
we further urge that this Court should find for appellants
on the ground that the 5 percent signature requirement
satisfies a compelling state interest.

,

The Jenness v. Fortson, appellant submits, is a
watershed case where th.i3 Court upheld the satisfying the
compelling state interest test a signature requirement of
5 percent of the registered voters, whereas in Illinois, it
;e 5 percent not of the registered voters but actually the
voters who voted at the last general election.

And normally

voter turnout is 50 percent.
Storer v. Brown sustained a 5 percent signature
requirement.

13
There is — in

the interest of doctrinal continuity

that this 5 percent requirement which this Court has sustained
be maintained.
In fact appellees are suggesting a chipping away
of the 5 percent.

And they rely on Lendall v„ Jernigan.

And

appellant suggests that they are overstating their case.
In the Lendall v, Jernigan case, the state of Arkansas
failed to satisfy — according to this Court — the compelling
state interest test.

It was a 10 percent requirement.

The Court did note that in the city of Little Rock#
50 signatures were required# whereas in a larger state
senatorial district# more signatures were required.
But that was not the reason that the Court — this
Court# we suggest — struck down Lendall v. Jerniganj
The reason it was struck down was that 10 percent was too high.
Illinois has 5 percent# which is not too high.
And most important the district court took 25,000
signatures and superimposed that as a maximum on the 5
percent signature requirement.

We submit that there is no

authority whatsoever for this,
This Court in Lendall v. Jernigan does not take the
50 signatures maximum for the city of Little Rock# Arkansas,
and say that was the most signatures that would be required.
5fou merely struck down the 10 percent signature requirement.
If I may now address myself to the question of

14
mootness:

The resolution of th® question of the authority of

an election agency to lower signature requirements and extend
the filing period is capable of repetition and evading review.
We maintain that a resolution of this question will
determine the rights of the litigants, particularly the
Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners.
They maintain that they have the right in special
elections to deviate from the statute, to lower the statutory
signature requirement, to extend filing dates.

It brings in a

personal factor.
Where the statute was universalistic and fair to
everyone, they enter into a private agreement.

And we feel

j.hat even though the election is over, based on this Court's
decision in American Party of Texas v. White and Storer v.
Brown, Moore v. Ogilvie,

that this issue is still viable

and that a ~ and that the issue should be resolved.
QUESTION:

You're net arguing for a consideration

of the second issue that the court of appeals considered, the
agreement between the Labor Party and the Chicago board, are
you?
MR. LEVINSON:

We are arguing that the doctrine of

mootness has been given lip service by the lower courts, but
that the issue is not meet, and that it should be remanded.
QUESTION:

But the — unless I’ve got the wrong

brief here or something ~ the Seventh Circuit did hold that

15
part of the case was moot.
MR. LEVINSON %
QUESTION?

That8s right.

And you don't disagree with that?

MR. LEVINSON!

Yes, we do.

We disagree with that portion of the Seventh Circuit
opinion which held that the issue of lowering signature
requirements in favor of one political party and not in

favor

of another — the U.S. Libertarian Party sought to intervene
and obtain ballot access with 18,000 signatures, and the
court said no.

The Chicago beard didn't agree to 18?GOG but

they agreed to 20- for the U.S. Labor Party.
We felt that was an issue which was capable of
repetition yet evading review and —

That's right.

That's correct, sir.

And isn’t there some reason for us

Cook County Board of Elections might do in the future better

MR„ LEVINSON:

Mo, sir.

I would say that that disqualification, removal
from office, any number of contingencies, could cause another
special election.

And I don't think any of us can foresee

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY D. COLMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. COLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
If I may begin by tidying to answer the question that
Justice Stevens was concerned about.
In Appendix C to the brief of Appellee Gerald Rose,
U.S. Labor Party, at page 19A in the appendix, in the pages
listed at the top, this is the jurisdictional statement
filed in Jackson v, Ogilvie by the appellants.
In this jurisdictional statement, as Mr. Levinson
indicated, reference is made to the memorandum of law filed
by the attorney general in the: district court J
gut if the Court will review page 19A, you011 see
the context in which the reference is made to the attorney
general5 s memorandum.

The appellants in Jackson v. Ogilvie

raised two questions in this Court:

first, they questioned

whether the 5 percent requirement for independent and new
party candidates discriminated against those people vis-a-vis
established political parties, Democrats and Republicans.
Second, they questioned whether the 5 percent
requirement applied to independents and new political

18
parties in Illinois was more onerous than in other states.
And it's in that context that the appellants in
Jackson v. Ogilvie said* for a most persuasive answer to the
foregoing inquiry, it is respectfully suggested *—
QUESTION;
MR. COLMANs
QUESTION:
MR. COLMAN?
two-fifths

You are now reading from 19A?
Yes, Your Honor.
About where on the page?
Oh, about a third of the way down,

of the way down.
It is most respectfully suggested that this Court

might properly look to and reasonably rely on the response and
pleadings and memorandum of Ic.w filed by the attorney general.
That was the context of the reference in Jackson v.
Ogilvie to the defendant's memorandum filed in the district
court.
We submit, and we believe, that the opinions of this
i

Court support this proposition, that it would cause chaos if
^strict courts and state courts are forced to look to the
record filed in this Court in order to determine whether a
summary affirmance is binding on them.
Mr. Justice Brennan has spoken vary persuasively to
this matter on numerous occasions.
QUESTION:

But that's been a dissent primarily, hasn't

it?
MR. CQLMAN.s

That's been a concurring opinion in

19
Mandel ve Bradley.

And in Mande1 v. Bradley the majority

per curiam opinion supports that position as well.
QUESTIONS

Well, unless it's a 5 to 4 decision,

per curiam opinion don’t carry any weight.
MR. CGLMANs

We would submit also that in Hicks u.

Miranda the opinion of Mr. Justice White in which he indicates
that those issues properly presented to this Court are the issues
that are binding on lower courts insofar as summary affirmance
is concerned.
It's hard for anyone to conceive that the segment on
page 13Aon our brief, that which was filed in the jurisdictional
statement in Jackson v. Ogilvie,

properly presents to this

Court, the question that is before you today?
QUESTION:
MR. COLMAN:

Which is what do you think?
Which is whether section 10-2 and

10-3 of the Illinois election code, which require local
candidates in Chicago and Cool County who are independents or
new political parties to obtain far in excess of 25,000
signatures to obtain

ballot placement, as opposed to a

maximum 25,000 signature requirement for all other elections
in the state of Illinios.
If I may by hypothetical give you what is the reality
in Illinois.

If I want to field an independent candidate for

president of the United States, the attorney general of the
state of Illinois, governor of the state of Illinois, or any

20

other office outside of Chicago, I can satisfy the state's
needs by obtaining 25,000 signatures.
It's only
QUESTION;
MR. COLMANs

Do you have to split them up among counties?
No, Your Honor.

.

QUESTION: So.that you could get 25,000 signatures in
Cook County?
MR. COLMANs

The

reality — yes, Your Honor.

The reality is that 25,000 people can bind together
:Ln Cook County, or in the city of Chicago, and field an
entire slate of candidates for statewide office, for President
of the United States, for any office except those offices
in Chicago where the 5 percent requirement would require them
to get more than 25,000 signatures.
This is the absolutely irrational classification
that is set forth in the statute.
QUESTIONs

I take it that Cook County is the only

Illinois county in which this could happen?
MR. COLMANs

That's correct, Your Honor.

That is

correct.
In fact, the second most populous county in the state
is Du Page County, and the 5 percent requirement in Du Page
County would require 12,000 signatures.
The second most populous city in the 3tate of
Illinois is Rockford, and the 5 percent requirement there

21
requires 1,500 signatures,,
QUESTION?

Is that Rockford or Winnebago County?

MR. COLMAN:

That's in Rockford cityg the second

most populous county is Du Page County.
QUESTION:
MR. COLMANs
QUESTION:
MR. CGLMAN:

Is Rockford bigger than Peoria?
Excuse me?
Is Rockford bigger than Peoria?
That's according to the 1970 census,

Your Honor, which is the official census.

In 1970, Rockford

had 31,000 votes cast for mayor, and that was the second
highest vote at that time.
I'm sorry, that was in the 1977 election, but the
population was the second highest.
QUESTION:

Wall, let. me go back once more, if I may,

to pages 19A in Appendix D„
You pointed out that 19A doesn't articulate the
argument that's being debated right now.

I notice, however,

on the lest sentence of paragraph 2 on page

23A it does

precisely identify the argument that you're making.
NOW —

MR. CQLMAN:

And — I’m sorry, Your Honor.

Actually

it's not a precise statement of the argument we're making.
In that memorandum on page 23A the attorney general
is drawing a distinction between the requirements for
independents in the city of Chicago and for new political

22
parties statewide.
Actually, that was a complete misstatement of
what sections 10-2 and 10-3 require.
The proper articulation of the argument is that
both independents and new political parties running in the
city of Chicago are required to obtain more than 25,000
signatures.
running

And both independents and new political parties

statewide need obtain no more than 25,000 signatures.
So if we're looking at page 23A, it does not ever

literally or specifically state the argument that's before
this Court.

It misstates the law.

QUESTIONS

It does state a similar argument.

Are

(.hay very close?
MR. COLMANs
QUESTION:

It alludes to it, Your Honor, but —•
What — where did — was Appendix D

actually an appendix to the jurisdictional statement filed?
MR. COLMANs
QUESTION s
MR. COLMANs

It’s my understanding that it was.
I see.
I stated earlier that in our view, as

well in the view of the district court and the court of appeals
that this classification which requires independents and
new political parties in Chicago, in Cook County, to obtain
more than 25,000 signatures is irrational.
We, of course, maintain — and the state board has
never questioned us on this

that rationality is not the

23
test to be applied by this Court.
stake in this case.

Fundamental rights are at

The Court has long acknowledged that the

fundamental right to vote and the freedom of association
contain@d within the First Amendment support a compelling
state interest test whenever the sfccite attempts to classify

and legislate in an area that would deprive people of access
to the ballot.
QUESTIONs

Well; is your argument here limited to the

comparison of this statewide offices —
MR. COLMANs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Absent the 25,00 signature limit for —

in other situations -- would you be here?
MR. COLMANs
QUESTION;:

No, Your Honor.
You don't think the 5 percent requirement

on its face, or in the context of Illinois politics is
unreasonably burdensome?
MR. COLMAN:

We thought that it was within the

context of the special mayoral election held last year.
QUESTION s
MR. COLMAN:

But not generally?
Generally, this Court has upheld it.

And while I disagree with the opinion in Jennass v. Fortson,
X acknowledge that I would not -QUESTION:
MR. COLMAN:
QUESTION:

Here you had only 81 days?
That's correct, Your Honor.
But you're not arguing ~ you9 re not

24

supporting the judgment on that ground here?
MR. COLMAN?

That's not crucial to the Court.

We

would certainly assert it as an independent grounds for
affirmance,, and we do in a footnote in our brief.
QUESTION;

Well I thought that that was what you

concede was decided in Jackson v. Ogilvie.
MR. COLMAN:

That was decided in Jackson v, Ogilvie,

Your Honor, within tha context of a general election.
QUESTION;
MR. COLMAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.
And if I make this —
Which is simply an attack on the 5 percent

requirement as such.
QUESTION;

But there you had an unlimited time to

get the —
MR, COLMAN;
QUESTION;
MR. COLMAN;

That’s correct.
— signatures, and here only 81 days.
If I want to run for mayor of the city

0£ Chicago in 1999, I can go out and start collecting my
signatures tomorrow.
QUESTION;
MR. COLMAN:

Do you expect to do that?
No, Your Honor.

In this case, the stcite itself has determined that
25,000 signatures satisfy the state's interest in making sure
that candidates for statewide office and for President of the
United States have a sufficient modicum of support.

25
And if I may just again allude to something that Mr.
Justice White said, in cases that followed

Dunn v. Blumstein,

this Court has upheld a 50 day durational residency requirement.
We would submit that if Illinois, for example, had
a 50-day durational residency requirement, which was upheld
by this Court, but then amended its statute to say that it would
be 30 days for statewide offices, or 30 days for local offices,
whichever it would be, the state would have an obligation
to justify the discriminatory treatment.
It may be able , to satisfy that obligation in
certain cases.

In this case, however, it has only stated that

they need a sufficient modicum of support, and 25,000
signatures satisfied that requirement.
And with regard to the mootness claim, we believe
that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was correct.

The

case before the Court today is different from all of the
other mootness cases that hav® com© before this Court in the
election context.
Those cases all involved continuing statutory
,3nactments, where the statute itself would have effect in an
election year, and after that, year after year after year.
The mootness question here is whether the state board
of elections,

and the city board of elections, have

overlapping powers; whether the city board of elections
properly entered into a settlement agreement that specifically

26
applied only to the special mayoral election back in 1977»
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that
there was little likelihood of any recurring problem in this
area? and therefore? dismissed the appeal on that question as
moot»

Did the Court of Appeals rely at all just on the sheer
burdensomeness of it? or did -- was its principal ground? or

that was limited essentially *to the disparity between 25? 00

(
Wall? what if we disagreed with you?

Wouldn't it be consistent with Storor in terms of burdensome­
ness? so shouldn't it be remanded?

yes.
MR. COLMANs
QUESTIONS

I'm sorry.

Yes? we would argue that.

But that issue? I should suppose? should

MR. COLMANs

That was the issue that we entered into

a settlement agreement on, Your Honor.
The way this whole thing came about —
QUESTION?

Well, I know, but there's an

permanent

injunction outstanding.
MR. COLMAN:

That's correct.

And the permanent

injunction says —
QUESTION!

And the question is, should the permanent

injunction be outstanding for a reason other tha n the
reason given in lower courts?
MR. COLMAN:
QUESTION:

It should not.

If this Court —

Well, I know, but shouldn’t it be decided

there first?
We shouldn't address the validity of the 5 percent
requirement going on, should we?
MR. COLMAN:

No, you should not.

And the only

basis for tha permanent injunction was the district court’s
finding that the requirement that you obtain more than 25,000
signatures did not meet the state's necessary obligation,
its obligation to show what is required to meet the constitutional
and permissible standards.
QUESTION:

Mr. Colman, under our practice, isn't it

usual, if a court of appeals decides that an issue decided
by a district court is moot, we don't simply dismiss the

28
appeal, but we direct that the complaint be dismissed?
MR. COLMANs

In this case. Your Honor, the only thing

that was found to be moot by the court of appeals was the
settlement agreement; not the —— there is a permanent
injunction, as Mr. Justice White notes, that is in effect and
Ls in operation, and tomorrow's election in Illinois, and in
next year’s election — and that was based on the equal
protection analyst.
Your Honor is correct in terms of what the law would
be if the entire case was found to be moot.
QUESTION?

Well, but this is half the case.

This is

a different issue than — than the other half of the case.

And

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD REOSTI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. REOSTI:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
It is my contention that there is basis for
determining that the 5 percent requirement in Cook County and
in Chicago in the context of Illinois politics, and in the
context of the history of the Illinois election law, is
too burdensome.
QUESTION:

Well, now, do you suggest that that issue

was decided in the court of appeals?
MR. REOSTI:
QUESTION:

No, I wouldnst suggest that, Your Honor.
Are you saying that we should decide it

30

if we can reject the
MR. REOSTIs

equal protection argument?
!9m saying if this Court decides to

reject the equal protection argument that it can be decided
on its face.
QUESTION:
MR. REOSTIs
QUESTION:

Well, I know we could, but ~
And should in this case.
— a good part of that kind of a judgirsent

Is some feel for local politics.
MR. REOSTIs

I think, Your Honor, that the 20 —

that the history of the application of the 25,000 signature
requirement on a statewide basis

provides this Court with

ample basis for determining that given the effectiveness of the
25,000 signature requirement, that the additional burden, in
light of the significance of that burden, would be clearly
unnecessary.
QUESTION:

Well, but the parties seem to have been

able to satisfy it on prior occasions.
MR, REOSTIs
QUESTION:

I°m sorry.
The 5 percent, they9ve been able — it

hasnst proved intractable, has it?
MR. REOSTI:

Your Honor, in Cook County, it has proved

impossible.
In other words, no candidate, according to the record
in this case, no candidate, whether a third party or an
independent, has ever qualified for office in Cook County

31
':oy

meeting the 5 percent requirement.
Furthermore, only on© candidate in the history of the

law, since 1931, prior to the decision below, only one candidate
lias ever qualified for office in Chicago by meeting this require­
ment .
So that if you take all the elections in Cook County
and Chicago together, only once has anyone ever met that qualifrlcation.

So it is a substantial burden.
When w© look at the burden in terms of Cook County

alone, the additional signatures required, just the increment
alone, would equal 4 percent of the total electorate.
Now 4 percent, as we know,, is very close to the
maximum amount of signatures that this Court has ever said is
permissible on the part of a state.

So it's very close to the

very maximum burden that this Court has allowed a state to
impose on these very fundamental rights.
And yet this is just the increment alone.

If we9re

going to look at the increment, we must look at the need for
the increment.

That need, it seems to me, has to be viewed

in the context of the fact that the state of Illinois has
fashioned a lass drastic alternative for protecting its
interests, which at least on a statewide level, has served
those interests

very well since 1931.

There is certainly nothing in the record to suggest
that the application of the 25,000 maximum for a much larger

32
population has resulted in bedsheet ballots, has resulted in
the inclusion of frivolous candidates on a statewide level»
QUESTION;

What do you understand to be the

justification offered by the state for a greater signature
requirement in Cook County elections?
MR. REOSTIs

None

whatsoever.

They indicate that the only requirement for the 5
percent in Cook County is to test the fact that the candidate
has a modicum -- they put it, has some community support.
I assume that they mean a significant modicum of community
support.
Certainly if a candidate on a statewide level ii?ifch
25,000 supporters has a significant modicum of support, the
interest must be the same, then a candidate in Cook County or
Chicago with 25,000 supporters must,, in terms of Illinois —
QUESTION:

But you don't understand the state to have

ever said more than that?
MR. REOSTIs

I do not understand them to have ever

said more than that?
QUESTION:

Maybe an independent candidate in Cook

County just needs a lot bigger base of support than a
statewide candidate.
MR. REOSTI:

He may need a lot bigger base of support

to win, but he doesn't need a bigger base of support to become
a legitimate candidate.

33
A legitimate candidate is a legitimate candidate.
In the context of Illinois»
The difference between this case and Jenness is
that the Court did not have before it a state-fashioned
alternative as it does here.
The fact of the matter is that Illinois has said,
this is the test that wo8 re going to apply on a statewide
'V

basis to determine who is a serious, non-frivolous candidate.
QUESTION:

Could a state say that in a large county

we have, hypothetically, established political machines of the
regular party, and

an independent just doesn't have much of a

chance there.
And so we’re going to require more for him to run in
that particular county or city than we would statewide where
he -- an independent *— has a much larger base to draw on
statewide?
It may be a rather cynical approach, but could a
state say that for constitutional purposes?
*

MR. REOSTIi

1 don’t think so, because it is cynical.

And I think basically that when a state puts forth a reason
for burdening the very important fundamental rights which
are at issue here, that that interest that it puts forth has
to be as -- has to not be cynical; has to be as real and
concrete and related to its legitimate interests as the
burden that it’s putting in —

34

QUESTION:
MR. REOSTI:

Well, it could be both cynical and realD
Welly I don't see any relationship

between any of the interests that this Court has indicated
are legitimate state interests, which justifies burdening the
fundamental rights at issue here, and the interest of insuring
that somebody can get on the ballot, that they're going to win;
which I take it is the essence of that argument.
I don't think the Court has ever gone that far.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reosti, if I may ask you a

background question.
When did this discrepancy in the statute arise?
long has this statute read this way?
MR. REOSTI:

How

Do you know?

It's read this way since 1931.

By the way, it should be noted that the state has
twice in recent years had a chance to amend the statute and
do something about the 25,000 signature requirement, and in
each case they've kept it.
QUESTIONs

They've kept the 25,000.

It's also rather interesting that •—

I'm noticing this appendix D again — the governor of Illinios
and the attorney general of Illinois

took the position the

statute was unconsitutional, didn't they?
MR. REOSTI:
QUESTION:
MR. REOSTI:

That's correct.

That's correct.

That's rather remarkable.
Well, if there aren't any questions,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

anything further, Mr. Levinson,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. LEVINSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LEVINSON;

With regard to the 5 percent signature

requirement, it8s not solely directed at Cook County.

It is

applicable at all 102 counties in the state in excess of
1,200 municipalities, 3,000 townships.
So it9e not solely directed at the city of Chicago,
or the county of Cook.
QUESTION s

But the result of the statute is that in

Cook County you need more signatures to run as a county-wide
candidate than you do to run in the state of Illinois as a
statewide candidate.
Now how does the state justify that?
MR. LEVINSON:

It*s — I suggest that some historical

staging is necessary in terms of a justification.
The approach taken by the general assembly with
regard to statewide candidates is somewhat different with
regard to any and all other candidates; local, township, county
and so forth.

It was both based on geographic considerations

as well as signatures.
There was a requirement of: 200 voters from at least
50 counties, plus 25,000 signatures.
This Court, in Moore v. Ocrilvie, on the basis of

36
one-man-one-vote, struck down the 200 voters requirement»
The statute was amended, and it provided that not more
than 13,000 signatures may come from any one county to be
counted towards the 25,000 signatures.
In the case of Communist Party of Illinois v.
State Board of Elections, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,
again on the basis of one-man-one-vote, struck down the 13,000
signature requirement.
Therefore, the 25,000 signatures is just a vestigial
remnant of a plan which was based on geographic plus signature
requirements; a totally different scheme than the 5 percent
which was uniformly applicable to ail municipalities, townships
and counties.
QUESTION;

You say if the courts had simply left the

legislative plan alone from the beginning it would be a lot
more rational than it is now.
MR. LEVINSONi
not guess.

Well, I believe Justice — I better

There was one justice who dissented in Moore

v. Qgilvie, claiming that there was a rational basis for a
geographic distribution, and there was a conflict of
constitutional principles.
That was one of the justices of this Court.
We are only suggesting that the appellees are urging
0n this Court that a new classification be created; that in
populous areas, less than 5 percent signatures be required, but

37
in rural areas, 5 percent be required.
Sc

they are in fact urging a new classification.

If, in fact, 25,000 becomes superimposed as a ceiling,
because then you only need 2 or 3 percent —
QUESTION:

Well, would you ---- you think you just have

to go about it by percentages?
MR. LEVINSONs

Yes, I think if the general assembly

requirement for statewide candidates, we wouldn't foe here
today.

this Court —

That's right.

Because in all other areas —

QUESTION?

MR. LEVINSON:

That's true.

39

I have only one short point to add.
With regard to the facts in this case, the signature
requirements in Jackson v. Ogilvie were 60,000.

In this

instant case, there were only 36,000.
There was a restriction on signers of petitions of
independent and new political parties that they must not have
voted in the previous primary.

Section; 10-4 of the election

code was amended, and there is no longer a restriction.
The facts are much more favorable to the state in the
context of this case than in Jackson v. Ogilvie.
QUESTIONS

What was your position in Jackson v. Ogilvie?

MR. LEVINSONs

We were not created.

There was no

State Board of Elections at that time.
QUESTIONS

Did the state take a position?

MR. LEVINSONs

Yes, they argued against the

constitutionality of the act, and this Court did not accept
that argument.
There was no fact finding done by the lower court.
We were denied a hearing, in violation of rule 65.

Questions

had been propounded by this honorable Court as to what has
been the history?

How many candidates have been allowed on —

new political party candidates and independents?
And certain statements

have been made.
