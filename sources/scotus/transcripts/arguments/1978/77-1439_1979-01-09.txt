MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in No. 77~l439j William Riley Hughes v. Oklahoma.
Mr. Helton, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. M. HELTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HELTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before you on appeal from the Court of
Criminal Appeals of the State of Oklahoma in which the
appellant was convicted of violating the following section of
the Oklahoma Wildlife Code, specifically section 4-115B, which
provides in pertinent part as follows:

t!No person may

transport or ship minnows for sale outside the state which
were seined or procured within the waters of this state except
that:

1.

Nothing contained herein shall prohibit any person

from leaving the state possessing three (3) dozen or less
minnows; 2. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit sale and
shipment of minnows raised in a regularly licensed commercial
minnow hatchery.”
It is my position here in support of the proposition
that the subject law is repugnant to the commerce clause of the
United States primarily, If it please the Court, based upon
the decision of this Court of this past term of City of
Philadelphia v. New Jersey in —

1?

QUESTION:

Mr. Helton, I take it you are relying

solely on the commerce clause?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, no other.
You are not relying on the privileges and

immunities clause or anything else, just -MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

That is right,
You put your case on the commerc clause,

MR, HELTON:

Yes, sir, no other constitutional ground

do I position at all.

That is to say that Inasmuch as this

law is one-hundred percent on its face blocked or curtained
against interstate commerce, that it constitutes therefore
that discriminatory nature that destruction of the right to
engage in interstate commerce by other states and their
citizens, particularly within the rule of this Court in City
of Philadelphia v. New Jersey, wherein, Mr. Justice Stewart,
writing for your Court, said that whenever the discrimination
reached a certain — well, when it was that degree of discrim­
ination, that it just constitutes a barrier, a curtain to
interstate commerce, it is unnecessary, it is immaterial to
determine x^hether or not the state in enacting its law properly
exercises police power.
QUESTION:

What if Oklahoma passed a statute that

had as its preamble the recital of the supply of buffalo, if
they have any, or elk, if they have any, being limited, there
could be only one taken by any person within a certain limited

5
season and none could be taken outside the state?
MR. HELTON:

All right, sir.

Oklahoma did that in

its conservation law in section 116(a), the very following
section that follows this section, and I think that is a
perfectly valid law.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. HELTON:

The difference, sir, In this case and

the supposed case that you gave me Is the party here complain­
ing is not the party with the right of access.

In this case,

a Mr. Fred Schokey Is the man who took the minnows from the
waters of the state.

Mr. Hughes bought the minnows from Mr.

Schokey under this lar.
QUESTION:

But under this particular statute that

is before us now, there is no prohibition against his buying
them, but there is a prohibition against his taking them out
of the state, is there not?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

That is right.
How do you distinguish that from takinp;

the elk out of the state?
MR. HELTON:

All right, sir.

The difference between

the right to take, in my judgment, is the state very likely,
in fact I think without question the state has and is
properly exercising its police power when it controls the
access to Its wildlife as distinguished from controlling the
right —• that is, prohibiting the right to transport, when at

6
the same time they never prohibited, they never in any manner
prohibited and attempted to control the disposition of the
commerce in it from the license taker to the next party»
QUESTION:

So that under the law you may commercial­

ize with natural minnows as long as yout ransport and sell
them inside the state?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You can take natural minnows and sell

them within the state of Oklahoma?
MR. HELTON:

I don't think there is any question

about — you are asking me about the right of Oklahoma to
limit —
QUESTION:

No, I am asking if I am a dealer In

minnows 1 can buy natural minnows or I can go sine them my­
self and sell them to anybody I want to inside the state?
MR„ HELTON:
QUESTION:

You are right, that is —
And I can transport them anywhere I want

to Inside the state for sale?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But I can't transport them across the

boundary for sale?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

Correct.
Or he can destroy them if he chooses,

burn them up?
MR. HELTON:

I’m sorry, sir.

7
QUESTION:

I say or he can destroy them if he

chooses or burn them up, as long as he does it within the
state of Oklahoma.
MR. HELTON:

That would be right.

What I think

would help us is to understand that this overall conservation
code of Oklahoma divides the commerce into two steps.

There

is a division in the commerce, and the first step of the
commerce is from the water to the party authorized to fake
them out of the water.

That is step number one of commerce.

And if the Court please, that is internal commerce.

What

Texas people, Texas as a sovereign would have any interest in
that, they would have none whatever.
Now, there is a second step in the commerce, and
that second step is when the authorized taker sells and
disposes, and at that point because, sirs, because Oklahoma
never put any kind of restriction on his right, the second
step of that commerce is one-hundred percent unregulated by
Oklahoma.

Oklahoma has not even enacted anything other than

this one section that deals with that second step of commerce.
QUESTION:

But that regulates, doesn't it, that one

section that you just referred to?
MR. HELTON:

It does, sir, but — and I don't dis­

agree with you, but the one object though is to prevent the
exportation.

But the very object of it at that point, since

Oklahoma never by any other law limited that second step in

8
any manner, never controlled it in any manner, at that point
it had become interstate commerce and at that point this law
that they passed put the curtain that it cannot lift.
QUESTION:

You say then that Oklahoma could prohibit

any sort of commercial dealing in natural minnows?
MR. HELTON:

I believe they can, sir, provided that

they make the records of the necessary finding that is the
basis of their exercising their police power.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought the police power was

always presumed to have been properly exercised unless the —
MR. HELTON:

Well, I don’t understand that it is

always presumed., sir.
QUESTION:

Well, aren’t all state laws presumed

constitutional?
MR. HELTON:

I am aware of the burdens to that

effect, but I am also aware that x^hen a law shows on its face,
for example, and refutes that presumption, then the presump­
tion is refuted.
For example, if 1 am wrong in my position, that is,
if I am wrong in my position that the rule

City of

Philadelphia doesn’t apply to the case, for example, if I am
wrong In that, which I strongly believe I am not in

error,

but If I am wrong in this question, that In event that a law
enacted under the police power is going to interfere with
Interstate commerce, there is a question of whether or not it

9
is -- the question then is it doing it incidentally.

In other

words, though there be a valid exercise of the police power
in connection with the operation of that valid exercise , is
there an incidental effect upon interstate commerce, and what
is the law in that respect.
Well3 at that point it has

recently

been deter­

mined by this Court that the burden shifts upon the state to
justify Its own use, its police power use, and in its justifi­
cation it must among things show that it could not use its
police power in a different manner thereby reducing the burdens
on interstate commerce.
Now, then, in this case if we agree that the object
of this law, which I find nothing in this law that supports
this object either expressly or Inferentially, but the
Oklahoma high court did.

They said the purpose was to prevent

depletion of minnows by commercial exportation or portatlon.
Oklahoma did not but could have put catch limits on the
minnows.

Oklahoma could have but did not make any control

over how many minnows the dealers would have in possession at
one time»
QUESTION:

Could they put a limit on how many could

be transported over the state line?
MR. HELTON:

They certainly could, in my opinion,

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

And haven’t they done so indirectly here?

10

MR. HELTON:

No, sir, for the reason that *— well,

the real object of the three-dozen rule, sir, l^e've got a lake
down there between Texas and Oklahoma that Red River runs
through, and the three-dozen rule in my opinion has reference
to that lake»
QUESTION:
MR0 HELTON:
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:
Honor»

Texoma or something, it Is called?
Beg pardon, sir?
The lake is called Texoma?
Yes, sir, that's the name of it. Your-

Then —
QUESTION:

What is the purpose — what do you suggest

was the purpose of the three-dozen limit?
MR. HELTON:

To take care of Lake Texoma.

In other

words, I am a Texan and I —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the statute about

that?
MR» HELTON:
QUESTION:

Beg pardon?
Is there anything in the statute about

that?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

No, sir»
What do you suggest on Its face that the

three-dozen limit implies or suggests?
MR» HELTON:
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:

Well, it —
It would hold down —
There really isn't anything from the

11
law that we could tell anything9 Your Honor»
QUESTION:

Well , Isn’t it the same kind of a limita­

tion that you put that you can only take six trout or five
pheasant or whatever, to conserve —
MR» HELTON:
QUESTION:

Well, I feel this way, that —
Isn’t It a conservation measure?

MR. HELTON:

I am unable to read a conservation

measure into three dozen.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t three dozen about what you

might need for a day of fishing to catch whatever limit
Oklahoma has?

Isn’t there a reasonable possibility that

there is a relationship?
MR. HELTON:

Well, my trouble, sir, Is I fish too

much and I can understand the relationship of three dozen to
us local boys that fish.

But that is not in this record, and

I understand it.
QUESTION:

You don’t really need more than three

dozen in a day, do you?
MR. HELTON:

I know that no three dozen could have

anything to do with conservation of minnows in Oklahoma, or
at least that Is my personal opinion.
the record though.

It is not supported by

Now, if I may be Indulging, I will say

that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Helton, I didn’t understand — and I

guess I am just stupid —- but what is the reference to Lake

12
Texoma?

Why would this problem —
MR. HELTON:

All right, sir.

On Red River, sir,

there is a lake, they dammed up that river and thus the water
of that river is in both states.
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:

Right.
So consequently I think the legislature

had in mind, if a Texas fisherman came over into Oklahoma to
buy him some minnows and thus go back on the Texas side of
the lake to fish, without this exception, he would be a
violator of this law.
QUESTION:

You want to make them fish on the Oklahoma

side of the lake, in other words?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:

That is true.
I see.
I haven’t thoup;ht about that, but that

would be one effect of it, to make him fish where he didn’t
want to fish.
QUESTION:

Of course, If they want to make him fish

on the Oklahoma side of the lake, they would have no
exception at all.
MR. HELTON:

If I listened to you, sir, you are

meaning to infer that if they wanted to leave the three dozen
in the act —
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:

They would force him to fish.
— the effect would be to make the

13
Texan people fish on the Oklahoma side.

Yes, sir, I think

that would be right.
Now, after we read the residue of this law, that is,
other than this section 4-15B, other than that one law there
isn’t a single law in the code that directs itself toward any
kind of general welfare protection, that is protection of
Oklahoma minnows.

It is totally barren of any kind of a law.

Because it is totally barren of any kind of a law,
why, automatically the only thing you can decide is that they
wanted to give the hatchery men an economic benefit, that it
is a discriminatory law that discriminated in favor of the
hatchery men.

There isn’t a thing about the lav; that is to

foster and carry out and further the general welfare povrer of
the people of Oklahoma.
QUESTION:
before you sit down.

Mr. Helton, could I ask you one question
Do you think it would be necessary if

we were to rule in your favor for us to expressly overrule
the case of Greer v. Connecticut?
MR. HELTON:

Well, sir, yes and no.

the yes part first and then the no part second.

I will answer
First, sir,

the statute in the Greer case is basically and fundamentally
different than this Oklahoma statute, and the difference Is
this:
taking.

Greer directed the prohibition to the very act of
The Greer statute says that it hereby prohibits any­

one to kill our xvildlife and remove them from the state.

Now,

I haven't quoted it to you verbatim,, but I haven’t deviated
badlyNow, this law, unlike Greer, isn't directed to the
taking.

The actual statute is unconnected with the power or

the access to take.
QUESTION:

That distinguishes Greer, in my book.
Well, it makes the Oklahoma statute

narrower than the one in Greer, doesn't it?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

Sir, I’m sorry?
Doesn't it make the Oklahoma statute

narrower than the one in Greer?
MR. HELTON:
QUESTION:

Narrower?
Because the Oklahoma statute regulates

less conduct than the Connecticut statute did In Greer.
MR. HELTON:

Well, sir, to me the Greer statute, the

emphasis is on the initial right to take.
doesn't focus on that.

The Oklahoma statute

It focuses trying to enforce some­

thing that is not visible within the law.
I said yes and no.

Nov;, the other part, the other

side of the coin is to me this Court in the last term, in the
last recent terms, in Baldwin v. Montana and all the cases
you debated there, remedied to interstate commerce only.

I

think that you have more or less terminated now the ownership
doctrine.

I am not talking about that you’ve terminated the

power of the statutes under the police power.

You said In

the majority opinion relative to the ownership of wild game in

15
the state was in error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bruce.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILL J. BRUCE, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BRUCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In order to focus upon Oklahoma’s argument before
this Court, I feel It incumbent upon me to bring to the
Court's attention the posture of the appellant's argument and
the Court's decision below.

The posture of the argument below

by the appellant was in the form of distinguishing Greer v.
Connecticut from the case of Foster Fountain Packing Company
v. Haydel.
Now, as this Court is aware, the Greer decision in­
volved wildlife.

The statute there prohibited the transport

of that wildlife across the state line.

In Foster Fountain

Packing Company v, Haydel, this Court looked at the underlying
fact situation involved In that case, where the Louisiana
statute in the name of conservation prohibited the exportation
of shrimp in which the heads had not been removed, thereby
requiring their removal in the home state of Louisiana.
This Court held In that case that the purpose and
effect of that statute was economic protectionism for
Louisiana residents, that Is, that that statute favored
Louidiana simply because by the very nature of the statute,

16
the packing was required to be done in Louisiana to the ex­
clusion of other states.
Now, In the loiter court, as I mentioned, the
appellant distinguished Greer v. Connecticut from Poster
Fountain Packing Company v. Haydel and relied upon the Poster
case, stating that it was applicable to this case.

The

posture, however, on appeal by the appellant here is that, as
I read his brief, that Greer v, Connecticut is no longer
viable when subjected to a commerce clause tact.
It is the view of Oklahoma that the concept in Greer
is still viable today.

The concept of the state’s interests,

the state's interest in controlling its wildlife is as much
to life today as It was in the time when Greer v„ Connecticut
was rendered.
QUESTION:

What in your opinion, Mr. Attorney General,

is the justification for the Oklahoma statute?
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

As a conservation measure, Your Honor.
Well, do you agree with counsel on the

other side that a Texas resident could go into Oklahoma and
buy minnows and burn them up in front of the commercial estab­
lishment from which he bought them?
MR. BRUCE:

I would agree that there Is no statutory

prohibition, no, sir.
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:

What?
The statute does not address that

17
possibility., no, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, if that is a possibility, why may it

be characterized as a conservation measure?
MR. BRUCE:

Well, as argued by the appellant below,

in which the state concedes, the only viable commercial use
for minnows is as bait for other fish.
purpose,
terests.

It serves no other

s far as man is concerned, In his commercial in­
Of course, the state maintains that minnows also

serve other important functions, of course, as a natural food
supply for game fish and,that the maintaining of the balance
of the minnow population in the natural streams —
QUESTION:

And for ducks and birds and a lot of

others, too, don't they?
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
They live off of minnows.
Yes, sir.
Isn't that interest served just as much

on the Texas side of the lake that straddles the state
boundary?
MR. BRUCE:

Are you speaking of Lake Texoma, Mr.

Justice Blackmun?
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:

Whatever the lake is.
Yes, I think that interest would serve

Texas as well as Oklahoma.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't it serve just as much on a lake

18
ten miles inside Texas as the Oklahoma lake?
MR. BRUCE:

I am not sure I understand your question

sir.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose Mr. Hughes here took his

minnows and sold them to Texas fishermen on a lake ten miles
inside the Texas boundary, isn’t that natural preservation
purpose just as well served there or are you restricting it
entirely to Oklahoma nature?
MR. BRUCE:

Well, I would concede that certainly

that would serve Texas Interests, but such xdiolesale exploita­
tion of minnows, natural minnows In Oklahoma streams, if
Oklahoma permitted the export, it would require Oklahoma to
not only keep track of what is happening but to make sure that
additional minnows were added to make up for those which were
exported.
QUESTION:

But at the same time, now, I could go

into Oklahoma and buy them and burn them up —
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Well —
—- and there is no statute that would

prevent me from doing so.
QUESTION:

Maybe the next legislature, counsel,

would take that into account and make that kind of prohibition
MR. BRUCE:
problem In Oklahoma.
(Laughter)

Well, sir, we’ve never had that type of

19
QUESTION:
MR. BrucE:

I doubt If you will, either.

Now, one other case cited by the appellant

is the City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey, of course, a recent
case by this Court Involving a dispute between New Jersey and
other states regarding the use of landfill sites.

In my brief,

i distinguish that case as I did other cases in that in that
case It involved the discrimination provision, in other words,
the state of New Jersey discriminated against out-of-state
citizens as opposed to the citizens of its own state.
QUESTION:

Also the subject of commerce wasn't wild­

life, the Greer case didn't have anything to do with that case.
MR. BRUCE:

Yes, sir.

And as I pointed out in my

brief or I hopefully pointed in my brief, that wildlife is a
unique area of the law and that the state has a special
Interest in conserving the wildlife.
QUESTION:

So you think in serving that end you can

permit commercialization with seined natural minnows within
the state but prevent their export?
MR, BRUCE:
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Just as a way of limiting the take?
A way of conservation, yes, Mr. Justice

Blackmun.
QUESTION:

Even though there are no limits on the

amount or number of minnows that your own people can take?
MR. BRUCE:

I might say that I believe other states

20

do use the possession limit as a means of protecting their
interests as a device to -QUESTION:

And any out-of-staters who come to

Oklahoma, they are free to buy minnows and use them in
Oklahoma waters —
MR» BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice, they are.
— and your Oklahoma supply people then

have the exclusive on the sale of the naturally seined minnows?
MR. BRUCE:

Well, they are licensed by the state,

yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Well, there is no prohibition against buy­

ing minnows in Texas and bringing them Into Oklahoma and using
them as bait, is there?

There is a prohibition on buying

Oklahoma minnows»
MR. BRUCE:
in issue here»

Well, that is the focus of our statute

There Is an Oklahoma provision regarding an

import license»
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:

Nov;, what Is that?
But that is not the focus of our Inquiry

here»
QUESTION:

What about it, can I bring minnows from

without the state and use them in Oklahoma waters?
MR» BRUCE:

The statute provides a procedure for

that»
QUESTION:

For the licensing?

21
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You don’t object bo commercial raising of

minnows and taking minnows?
MR, BRUCE:

Commercial hatchery minnows, no, Mr.

Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Or you don’t object to people taking them

and seining them, do you, as such?
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Because this man here was a professionals

that was his business, of seining wild minnows?
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So if you allow that unlimited, how are

you preserving wildlife or protecting wildlife?
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Well, the very nature *—
You let It be unlimited, the taking is

unlimited, right?
MR. BRUCE:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

No control at all.

MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:

As to the number taken, no, sir.
Yes.
Mr. Justice Marshall, in response to

your inquiry, it is true that Oklahoma has no numerical limit
on the actual taking of minnows from its natural streams.
There is really no need for that in light of the exportation
bar, that Is, since, as appellant and appellee both agree,

22

the only commercial interest in minnows is as bait»
the sole commercial interest in minnows.

That is

Then those that are

seined from Oklahoma streams are returned to Oklahoma streams
in the form of bait. so there is really no need "
QUESTION:

Well, suppose they were returned to the

streams in a state above Oklahoma, wouldn’t they in turn
return to Oklahoma?
MR» BRUCE:

Well, if it adjoined, if the stream ran

into Oklahoma, yes, sir, conceivably they would.
QUESTION:

So that is not the only point, is it?

QUESTION:

Mr. Bruce, when they are returned to the

streams as bait, their life expectancy isn’t very long, is it?
MR. BRUCE:
debate that.

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I won’t

I am not a fisherman, unlike Mr. Helton.

I am

not a fisherman.
QUESTION:

A minnow’s life expectancy isn’t the

longest anyhow.
QUESTION:

Would you take the position that Oklahoma

could have a statute that said that any fish caught in
Oklahoma shall be consumed in Oklahoma?

Isn’t that what this

statute does?
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Yes»
With respect to one kind of fish?
Yes.
They could say any fish caught here had

23
to be consumedg cannot be shipped out of the state.
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:
MR, BRUCE:
QUESTION:
MR. BRUCE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
That's the same issue, isn't it?
Yes.
That is like Greer.
Yes, sir.
You were discussing in response to some

questions the fact that there is no limit on how much, what
quantity of natural minnows can be seined within the state.
But the only rational purpose of seining them within the state
would be for a dealer to sell them under that three-dozen
limit to other fishermen, is that not so?

You wouldn’t go

about seining fish just for the -MR. BRUCE:
Justice.

For recreational purposes, no, Mr. Chief

That is —
QUESTION:

They are not too edible In that sense and

it would be pretty expensive fertilizer.

You would only be

seining them to probably sell them three dozen at a time to
fishermen,
MR. BRUCE:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

The statu­

tory scheme is self-executing, so to speak, that the natural
and commercial object of minnows serves as a natural limita­
tion.

If Oklahoma bars the exportation, then they would be

returned to Oklahoma streams In the form of bait.
Thank you

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Helton?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. M. HELTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT ~ REBUTTAL
MR. HELTON:

Your Honor, I wish to. In answer to

Mr. Justice White's question to counsel, In section 4-115A, it
provides that no person may ship or transport minnows for sale
into this state from an outside source without first having
first procured a license for such from the Director.

So if

you come to Oklahoma to fish from your native state of
Colorado, don’t bring any minnows with you.
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:

Without a license.
And you can’t get one -- that is talking

about a minnow dealer’s license.

You can’t get a minnow

dealer’3 license unless you are a resident of Oklahoma.
QUESTION:
MR. HELTON:

I see.
So I am pointing out to you that nobody

can come into Oklahoma to fish and bring your minnows into
Oklahoma.
QUESTION:

So no out-of-state minnow dealer, a

fellow who would like to sell you the fishing equipment can
sell you any minnows from outside the state, for two reasons:
one, he can’t get any Oklahoma minnows
MR. HELTON:

And then, of course, an outsider that

wanted to bring minnows into Oklahoma, a Texan who wanted to

25
bring minnows to feed the fish in Oklahoma* could not do it.
QUESTION:
Helton?
