ORAL ARGUMENT OP MICHAEL W. DYER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR, DYER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court i
The case at bar results from an automobile accident
which occurred in the State of Californici.

The driver of the

automobile was an employee of the State of Nevada whose pres­
ence in California resulted from his employment with the Univer­
sity of Nevada.

Neither his status as an employee of the State

of Nevada nor his status as being in the course of his employ­
ment were contested.

They have never been an issue in the case,■

When the action was initially filed, the State of
Nevada moved to quash service of process, on the basis of im­
munity from suit.

The trial court granted that motion.

upheld by the California Court of Appeals.

It was

The California

Supreme Court, in a 1973 decision, reported as Hall vc University
of Nevada, reversed the California Court of Appeals, remanded
the matter to the trial court, holding that sister states who
engage in activity in the State of California have no immunity
from suit.

The State of Nevada requested certiorari.

That

request was denied and the matter was returned to the Superior

4
Court for Alameda Countyf California.
At the beginning of the trials the State of Nevada
requested an order limiting any damages which resulted to the
statutory limitation contained in Nevada [s waiver of sovereign
immunity, that limitation being $25,000 per individual or per
claimant, or in the context of this action $50,000.

That motion

was denied and the jury returned the verdict of $1,150,000 as
against the State of Nevada, as a named defendant in this
negligence action.
The State of Nevada appealed to the California Court
of Appeals.

The California Court of Appeals sustained the

trial court verdict and the jury verdict.
Supreme Court denied hearing.

The California

Certiorari was requested and

certiorari issued to the California Court of Appeals.
In a capsule, the position of the State of Nevada ie
that unconsenting states may not be sued in any court in this
nation, and that where consent is given the terms, conditions
and limitations contained in that consent must be adhered to
and that any action tried must proceed according to the terms
and limitations of the consent.
The holding of the California Court of Appeals is
simply that sister states have no immunity from suit in the
State of California.
QUESTION;

As I was reading the briefs in this case,

the question that kept recurring to me is:

What is the Federal

5
issue here?

What is the Federal question?

California has decided that* as a matter of its
state law* that a Efcafce of the Union does not have sovereign
immunity in the California courts.
MR, DYER:

Why constitutionally?

I would initially respond by first

pointing out that this is not a conflicts case* despite
urgings of Petitioners,
QUESTION:

Why isn’t it just a matter of state law?

MR, DYER:

The basic constitutional issue that this

Court must reach is:

Does one state have the right to deter­

mine the sovereign status of its sister states* regardless -»
QUESTION:
from doing it?

What in the Constitution would prevent it

That’s my question,

MR, DYER:

The question,, may it please the Court* is:

What in the Constitution would enable it?
QUESTION:

A state can decide as a matter of state

law* or its courts can decide or its legislature can decide*
that it does not have sovereign immunity* insofar as suits in
.its state courts go against it.

Why can’t it make the same

sort of decision with respect to another state*
its courts?
MR0 DYER:
do so.

when sued in

i
The Etates of the Union would be free to

They would be free to make that determination if they

are free to treat each other as independent nations.
We urge that by entering the Constitution* by forming

6
a union;» a sisterhood of states, the states gave away their
ability to treat each other as independent nations, and agreed
to treat each other as sister states, at all times acknowledging
the status of their sisters as sovereign„
That limitation is found in the Full Faith and Credit
Clause and the decisions of this Court, which have held that
the Full Faith and Credit Clause, apart from requiring full
faith and credit be given to judgments, stood for the additional
principle

and I think, perhaps, more important principle --

of unifying the dtafces of the Union.
QUi&TION:

Ordinarily, the full faith and credit

relates to acts and events which have occurred within the
state which is asking full faith and credit be given to its
lawSo

This is an extraterritorial effect that you are asking

for, it would appear, of the Nevada law...
MR. DYER:
effect in Nevada law.

We are not asking for an extraterritorial
Our position, in a nutshell, is that any

state must acknowledge the status of her sister states as a
sovereign.
QUESTION:

What particular provision of the

Constitution — I think Mr, Justice diewarfc was probing for
that, - What particular provision of the Constitution tells us
that?
MR. DYER:

The Constitution --.I am trying to

answer the question, Mr. Chief Justice.

1 am not trying to

7
sidestep *

I want to address this question* because I think it

is* perhaps* the most important -QUESTION:

is there some other than the Full Faith

and Credit Clause that you are relying on?
MR, DYER:

I think what the Court must keep in mind

is that the Constitution is a document by which the states
granted limited powers to the Federal Government* and agreed
upon their relationships with their sister states,

Tne Tenth

Amendment to the Constitution provided that all powers not
granted were surrendered and the Constitution would be retained
to the states,
QUESTION:

One of fchsn wasn't immunity from Federal

suit* was it?
MR, DYER:

The Founding Fathers thought that it was.

The Court in Chisholm v, Georgia felt that it wasn't.
QUESTION:

No* I mean immunity from suit by the

United States.
MR. DYER:
Constitution was the

One of the specific powers granted in the
or one of the attributes of sovereignty

surrendered was the ability of a state to be sued in the
original jurisdiction of this Court.
fled in the Constitution.

That consent is speci»

There is nothing in the Constitution

that says the states agree to be sued in the trial courts —
in negligence actions in the tria:i courts of their sister
states.

8
At the time of the formation of the Constitution* all
the Founding Fathers felt that the states had the power to be
Immune from suit.

As a matter of fact* a case that.had been

decided recently before that, in 1 U.S,, was the case of
Nathan v, Bedford, I believe is the correct citation.

That

case involved the State of Pennsylvania attempting to assert
.jurisdiction over a sister state.

This was some two-three

months before the Constitutional Convention, and the case was
dismissed on the holding that no state may assert jurisdiction
over any other state,
QUESTION;

Putting to one side the possible arguments

you may make by implication from cases like that, why can’t
California rely on the Tenth Amendment here, just as well

or

perhaps better than Nevada, saying that all powers pot dele- gated somewhere else are reserved to it.

It didn't give up

the power to adjudicate claims over other states when it
entered the Union, so that it has reserved that.
MR. DYER;

It did not give up the authority to

adjudicate claims over other states, if in fact it has the
rights to treat other states as independent nations.

It did

give up the right to treat other states as independent nations.
Nowhere in the Constitution doss it say that.the
State of California may not sue United States Government, if
one of their employees is involved in a motor vehicle accident.
And yet, the tort claims immunity or the immunity of the

9
Federal Government# I think# would go unquestioned *

There

is nothing in the Constitution that says the states have the
right to do that.
QUESTION:

Isn't it treated by removal, basically

tne authority of Congress over the Federal courts and the
right to remove when a Federal officer is named a defendant
in a state court?
QUESTION:

Against the background of the Supremacy

MR, DYER:

That would be correct# but the point I am

Clause0

trying to make is that there Is nothing in the Constitution
that says that a state has authority to call her sister states
to bar.
In the very words of this Court — and I am quoting
from Cunningham v, Macon & Brunswick Railroad, 109 U.S. 446;
"It may be accepted as a point of departure unquestioned that
neither a state nor the United States can be sued as defendant
in any court in this country without their consent,"
This position has been consistently followed.

It

was earlier enunciated **» the axiom that a sovereign -- and
the Court has consistently used the term# "a sovereign" -- may
not be sued in any court has been consistently followed.

It

was Initially stated in the case of Beers v, Arkansas in 1857«
It has been followed In Hans v, Louisiana; Eac Parte Young;
Pardon v. Terminal Railroad; Ed e Ima n v» J o rd a n even alludes to

10

the Immunity of states from suite
QUESTION:

Mr. Dyer* may I ask you another question

about your theory?
Supposing, instead of this being a tort action, it
was a contract action.

Say your state agents had gone over to

California and bought half a million dollars worth of tele­
vision sets to use in the University»

Then they went back to

Nevada and just decided they wouldn't pay»

Could they be

sued?
MR® DYER:

If the contract initially --

QUESTION:

It was negotiated in California.

They

had sent people out with authority issued by the Governor and
the State Legislature, which said, "Go to California and buy
a lot of television sets."

And they did it in California and

they just refused to pay.
MR. DYER:
context.

Yes, I think they could be sued in that

And I think they could be sued, perhaps, even under

the Full Faith and Credit Clause, because we are then dealing
with rights and obligations created under laws of another state,
which the state knowingly entered into and intentionally entered
into.

The State of Nevada, at that point., would have inten­

tionally and knowingly entered into an agreement in California,
a contractual relationship,
I think it is important, to emphasize that perhaps
there may be a distinction, as the Court has noted, between

11

tort actions of a negligence character*, non-intentional torts*
and other forms of action»

4

• u

For Instance* many of the cases cited by the
California Supreme Court dealt with the question of the
ownership of land in one state and the attempt to claim
-- one state owning land in a sister state -- and the land­
owning state trying to claim that they were exempt from taxa­
tion laws»

The holding of that entire line of cases is* of

course* that when a state leaves the area which is normally
the operation of a state and enters into other functions* at
that point they agree to be bound by the terms of the area
which they have entered.

That is* when they enter into a

proprietary situation* they agree to be bound as any other
proprietary.
QUESTION:

Aren't there cases that say you don't

infer the casting aside of sovereign Immunity* which are
rather specific on It?
MR. DYER:
is Kenneoott Copper.

Perhaps the most leading case in that
It held* in language very analogous to

Nevada's statutory waiver* that when a state had stated that
"We waive our immunity and agree to be sued in any court*"
that any court did not mean any court.
not mean Federal court.

Specifically* it did

It meant any court of that state.

As the Court has pointed out* it is absolutely
necessary that any waiver of immunity be made specifically»

12

I would urge that it also be made knowingly.

And

that is perhaps the distinction, because -- and I know this
Court hears this more than they wish, but —
QUESTION:

You said just by sending the man over

there would be enough»

You certainly don't mean that now,

do you?
MR0 DYER:

I believe the Court has misinterpreted

my stat anent, because what I meant -- you are talking about my
response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question — when a state
enters into an area, that is, if a state engages in inter­
state commerce as a common carrier, where authority to regulate
has been specifically delegated in entering into a proprietary
function, then perhaps they enter that knowingly —
QUESTION:

You say that the state didn't have any­

thing to do with this car going out, except to own it.

Is

that your position?
MR. DYER:

No, our position is that Mr. Bohm,

the driver of the car,was routinely engaged in the performance
of his duties with the Unifcersity of Nevada, that in the course
of those duties he was requested to go to the State of
California to pick up some television parts for the Univer­
sity of Nevada, and that he was involved in an automobile
accident.
Now, based upon that, the California courts have
held that the State of Nevada consented to be sued in unlimited

13

liability.

If the Estate of Nevada consented to be sued in any

manner, we urge that we consented by our statutory waiver of
sovereign immunity, that when we waived immunity by NFS
Chapter 41 and said, "We agree to have our liability adjudica­
ted in the same manner as private parties."
QUESTION:

Are.you saying? MrtdDyer? that the only

-- after all* what the Pull Faith and Credit Clause says shall
be given is to the public acts, records and judicial pro­
ceedings

the only public act of Nevada that you urge has

been denied full faith and credits is your waiver of sovereign
immunity statute with a $25,000 limitation?
MR. DYER:

I think that would be a fair statement

of our position.
QUESTION:

That's the only one?

MR. DYER:

I believe that’s the only Nevada statute

drawn in issue.
QUESTION:

And that’s the only extent to which you

rely on the Full Faith and Credit Clause?
MR. DYER:

No, that’s not correct.

We also rely

upon the Full Faith and Credit Clause, as I stated earlier,
because It is our understanding of-, the Full Faith and Credit
Clause that that clause, in addition to requiring that judg­
ments acquired In one state be given effect in another, unified
the states and substituted a command for the principles of
comity.

That is, the clause abrogated the states’ rights to

14

treat, each other as independent nations.
QUESTION:

At least in words, full faith and credit

shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of every other state.

That's the hold

of the clause, isn't it?
MR. DYER:

That is the entire language of the clause.

QUESTION:

How do we read into it what you have just

MR. DYER:

This Court has repeatedly held that the

sa id?

very purpose of the Full Faith and Credit Clause was to alter
the statute of the individual states as independent foreign
sovereignties,each free to ignore the rights and proceedings
of the others and to make each an integral part of a single
nation.
dome of the cases along those lines are Eherrer v«,
Eherrer, Order of United Commercial Travelers ~QUESTION:

Yes, but always in the context of whether

or not what we are dealing with are public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of the other state, isn't it?
MR. DYER:

I think an additional and important

concept that we are dealing with is union, sisterhood.

Union

can only work among individual states who, under the Tenth
Amendment, have retained all their rights which they had at
the time of
QUESTION:

So, even if you didn't have your

15

Sovereign Immunity limitation Act, you would be making the
argument of the Full Faith and Credit Clause?
MRo DYER:

If we didn’t have our immunity limitations

we would mostly likely be asserting that we could not be sued
under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, in and of itself,
because of the Full Faith and Credit Clause,
QUESTION:

That's simply because the Nevada dourts

have held their sovereign immunity, isn’t it?
MR„ DYER:

Sovereign immunity, as we know it in the

English system of jurisprudence, does not require a holding
by the courts that it exists.
citizen© to the sovereign„

It cannot be conveyed by the

It arises from the very nature of

sovereignty.
QUESTION:

Supposing that the supreme Court of

Nevada had said there is no longer any sovereign immunity in
Nevada.

You would not then be able to go into California and

say, "Even though you can recover a $1 million judgment
against the Etate of Nevada in the Nevada courts, you can't
sue us in California," would you?
MR, DYER:

That is correcto

We would not be able to

make that argument, but -QUESTION:

If the fact Is you can make it, it doesn’t

make any difference whether it’s a statute or a decisional
/

law in Nevada, does it?
MR0 DYER:

It doesn't make any difference whether it

16

was declared fco be invalid by judicial interpretation or
whether the legislature waived it, except one* and that is
that when the legislature waived sovereign immunity* they
placed a condition on It.

And* under the decisions of this

Court* if there is a condition placed upon the waiver* that
\

condition hag. to be given effect.
In essence* our argument is* if California attained
jurisdiction over us by our own waiver* they must apply the
limitation contained in that waiver.

If, in fact* we had

totally abrogated sovereign immunity.

If, in fact* the

Nevada Supreme Court had held that the doctrine had no
viability for the State of Nevada* we could not argue that
California could not obtain jurisdiction over us as any other
tort feaser, but at that point it would have been the Nevada
Supreme Court or the Nevada .Legislature that made that determination.
QUESTION}

And it could have been simply* I taka it*

if there had been no waiver of sovereign immunity even profconta, as there has been by the Nevada*

but the Nevada Supreme

Court had held that Nevada continue to adhere to the rule of
sovereign immunity*'you would urge that as a full faith and
credit principle that had to apply in California* too.
MR. DYfiR:
it is:

If I understand your question* Mr. Justice*

Assuming that Nevada Supreme Court had upheld the

principle of sovereign immunity In total and there had been

17

no waiver by the Legislature* we would at that time urge that
the State of California must acknowledge our status as a
sovereign and our determination that as a sovereign we still
retain sovereign immunity,,
It is the status question that, 1 think* is very
important in this case»

I think the Court should be aware

that there -- at least in our mind -- is a great distinction
between the status of a state as a sovereign and the ability
to exercise sovereign power.

We are not contending that we

have the right to legislate for California citizens.

We are

not contending that we have the right to say that our laws
have to be given extraterritorial effect.

What we are saying

is that California* as any state* must recognize our status
as a sovereign* that is that we have a sovereign status
and that one of the attributes of that status is immunity.
And once they recognize our status* they must recognize our
immunity.

If they obtain jurisdiction over it* It must be

pursuant to our consent* which in this case could have only
been given by our statutory waiver of sovereign immunity.
And if that is the case* then they have got to give
effect to the limitation contained in the statutory waiver.
QUESTION:
the state?

What if there is judgment entered against

How would California collect it?

MR. DYER:

In this particular case* California would

collect it by executing on our tax accounts which we maintain

18

in the State of California „
QUESTION;

So, you've got money in California,

property in California,

Otherwise, you could Just protect

yourself in your own courts, I take it,
MR, DY£R;

That's exactly right.

The only reason

that we have property in the State of California -<» I think
this is important,

Actually, there are two reasons.

because we are a small state.
people.

One is

The State of Nevada has 600,000

Most of our major businesses are headquartered in

our neighboring State of California,

Those businesses don't

even maintain large bank accounts in Nevada,

Rather, they

desire to collect their sales tax as it comes in, and when
they have to pay on a quarterly basis they pay it on a bank
draft out of the State of California,
So, because of the size of the State of Nevada,
because of our dependence in the modern business world upon
tax revenues coming in from accounts that our businesses wish
to maintain in another state, the other state has the ability
to execute against those accounts, and we don't have the
ability to rely upon our own courts to protect us.
But, I might point out to the Court that if, in fact,
Respondents*. position is correct, it wouldn't make any difference whether we had the right to protect ourselves, because
under Respondents" version of the case, we can be sued as any
other person in the State of California,

And when we are sued,

19

we are subject fco unlimited liability.
And* under their theory* we would be required to
give full faith and credit to the California judgment* not­
withstanding the fact that its unalterably opposed to our
state policy.
QUESTION:

Not if you decided that by your own law

they had no jurisdiction.
MR. DYER:

Your Honor* I would agree with that

statement* but I am saying I think Respondents' error is the
opposite.
Again* we are back to the key issue in the. case*
and that is consent.

Does one state have fco consent fco be

sued by her sister states* or can the states simply treat
each other in any manner which they choose?

If they were

independent nations* under the recent developments in the
law of independent nations* they could do just that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dyer* I asked you before about a

contract action* and you said that would be different.
Supposing this were a willful anti wanton malicious tort*
would you take the same position?
MRo DYER:

Initially* I would say* Mr. Justice*

that if this were a willful* wanton and malicious tort* it
would not be in the course of the employee's employment.
I can't conceive of any such tort in which fche^Sfcafce of Nevada
could be sued as defendant under the doctrine of respondents *

20

superior» on that- basis .

But» If in fact» it were a willful»

wanton» malicious tort» 1 don't think that fact should be
determinative a

If» in fact» the .itate of Nevada c.ould be

sued —
QUESTION:

If the State of Nevada sent its state

militia in to take over a part of somebody's private property
in the other state» they would be immune under your theory.
They would rely on the dignity of the sovereign not to do
anything like that» of course.
MR. jDYBR:

That would be correct» but 1 might also

point out thafc»spaaking of state militia» each year when the
State of Nevada National Guard goes to summer camp -- we don't
have any Army basis In our state -- our National Guard has to
go out to other states» to Washington, to California„

We

take all of our heavy equipment» our tanka, everything sl.se.
QUiiiTIUN:

They can chop down all the trees and dig

up the roads and be immune from '.'liability» is that right?
Is that your view, that they could?
MR0 DY£R:

1 think the answer to your question»

Mr. Justice, is that if we sent our militia —the State of
Nevada sent our militia» our National Guard» into the State
of California to seize property, that that would be an act
against a State of the Union, albeit immediately affecting a
private lando-wner „ it would be an act against the sovereignty
•of a sister state.

And it would, first of all, be cognizable

21
In this Court, under the original jurisdiction.

It would,

in fact, be a -—
QUESTION:
state.

I mean harmed individuals, not the other

You go in and chop down a lot of trees and haul away

the wood, or something like that.
MR. OYER:

If, in fact, we directed our employees

to go in and commit an intentional tort and we have not
waived sovereignty, it would be our position that California
would be required to recognize our sovereignty, that any
rights that they might have would have to be taken by the
State of California under the parens patre doctrine on behalf
of their citizens against us in this Court.
With the Court's permission, I will reserve the
remainder of my time.
QUESTION:

I would like to ask you a question, so

I can understand it, before you sit down, Mr. Dyer.
How far does your argument go today?

That,'there

couldn't be a suit at all, that any suit would have had to
have been brought by the California Plaintiff in Ormsby
County, Nevada, since that was the extent of the waiver of
sovereign immunity?
MR. DYER:

Do you take that position?
The essence of our position today is that

at the time of this action our waiver was intended to be
limited to courts of the State of Nevada.

But, if the Court

should construe otherwise, as a result of the

22

QUESTION;

I am not asking you what the Court might

hold* what the Court's position might be.

I am asking you

your position.,
MR. DYER:

Our initial position is that our statutory

waiver* under the Kennecott decision* did not constitute
jurisdiction -- excuse me* a waiver of immunity in other
states* but simply in our own courts»
QUESTION:

In Oirosby County* Nevada* for a limit of

$25,000* period»
MR0 DYER:

That would be correct»

QUESTION:

Is that it?

MR* DYER:

Yes* sir*

Mr* Rowe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVERETT P. ROWE* ESQ»*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROWE:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
1 have a little difficulty in understanding
Petitioners® position* but I thought what I should do at the
outset of my argument Is to go through what I think is not
involved in this particular case* and then get to what I think

23
are really the issues that are involved,
I think, first of all —
QUESTION:

Let me ask you, just before you get

launched Into it, because it may be relevant:

Could you have

got jurisdiction of the State of Nevada or its instruments
except by their consent in their waiver?
MR. ROWE:

I think, in this particular case, we

could have, by reason of this fact, and this is one of the
theories that we have set forth in the brief.

We feel that

a sovereignty of a state, its sovereign powers are coextensive
with the geographical limitations of that state.

And then

when that state goes outside of its state and entertains and
engages in activities in another sovereign state -*\ in this
case California, where the California sovereignty is supreme
— that they do not bring with them the prerogatives of a
sovereign, that Nevada, when they come in under those circum­
stances, operate an automobile on the California highways,
that they do not have the prerogatives of a 'sovereign.
Therefore, they do not have this attribute, as he quotes,
the attribute of Immunity.
QUESTION:

Your friend tells us that when Nevada

consented, waived, you took the bitter with the sweet, that
is, you took the jurisdiction with the limitation which Nevada
has prescribed o
MR. ROWE:

That's his argument.

We don't accept

24

that argumenta but we feel that If the argument has any basis
at all that our state courts would still have their consti­
tutional power of choice of law* similar to the Pearson case
which he cited as authority, which is really directly opposite
to his view.

In the Pea rs on ease, the New York case* they

discussed that a state has a constitutional right of choice
of law, and that they may choose certain portions of a statute
and reject others.

In that case* they rejected the Massachu­

setts limitation of $15,000 on recovery.for death action, and
they took other portions of the statute.
That is our position here, that the constitutional
right of choice of law of the State of California would allow
them to reject -- if you accepted his argument, except this
is required — would allow California to reject the monetary
limitation.
QUESTION:

Your client couldn't have sued the State

of Nevada in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of California, could he?
MR. ROWE:

/

No, I think that under the present law,

as I've been reading these law reviews on both sides and I
have been following the argument, which is a very important
constitutional debate that is going on before this Court now,
with reference to the Eleventh Amendment and Article 4 of
the Constitution, it would appear that the Federal court would
be precluded from taking jurisdiction.

25
QUESTION;

Do you see any anomaly there# in a Federal

union that the courts of the union are not allowed to assert
jurisdiction over the State of Nevada In this situation# but
the courts of a sister state# like California# are?
MR» ROWE:

Well# I think it is a problem that has

arisen by reason of the passage of the Eleventh Amendment
and the problems that the courts have had in dealing with
the Eleventh Amendment,
Federal jurisdiction.

But here# we are not seeking the
Here# I think# it is a different case#

because this State of Nevada is coming into California# outside
of its own sovereign jurisdiction# and Is operating an auto­
mobile# picking up television parts,
QUESTION:

But# presumably# it Is in the Federal

jurisdiction# whether it is in Nevada or in California,
MR. ROWE:

It could be# absent any restrictions in

the Constitution to entertain jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Do you contend at all that they were not

performing a sovereign function# when they came Into the
State of California?
MR. ROWE:

Of course# picking up television parts

QUESTION:

For what purpose?

MR. ROWE:

For a purpose of a school -- I think most

cases have held that -- I won't call it a sovereign activity.
It could be a governmental function.

Usually# education has-

been deemed to be -- educational function is governmental in

26
nature»
QUESTION:

How doj/ou distinguish governmental from

sovereign function?
MR» ROWE:

I would make the distinction because I

don't think that when Nevada is in California* when it is
outside of that area where there is a relationship between
governed and governor* that they actually are in the nature
of a sovereign,
QUESTION:

In other words* they drop their cloak

when they cross the border?
MR» ROWE:

Correct,

There are* of course*.precedent

for^that in other aspects of cases* mainly not dealing with
motor vehicle accident cases* but dealing with property
exemption from taxation»

There is the Minnesota case that I

cited* State v. Hudson* where the state — and this was a
governmental function.

There was a toll bridge which was

being operated for the highway system* which certainly could
be a governmental function.

And they claimed that they should

be exempt from taxation because it was a governmental function»
Hov/ever* that relief was denied.

They say that when that

state came into the other state and was present there* then
they are no longer — they lose the cloak of sovereignty and
they are to be treated as any other person within that state.
do* I think — That is our analysis of the situation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rowe* there aren't very many cases

27

involving fact situations of this type* are there?
MR* ROWE:

I could find none*
(?)

QUESTION:

Are you relying on the Pollis ease* In any

way* the North Dakota case of some years ago* that the
California court cited* but you don't cite it in your brief?
MR0 ROWE:

The District Court of Appeals cited it

against me, but I always thought that the case actually was
in my favor* because it actually gave the right of choice of
law in that particular case.
Workmen's Compensation claim*

That dealt with* I think* a
The District Court of Appeals

took great delight in citing that case against me* even
though I didn't have a chance to argue against it at the
time because it was really submitted without too much oral
argument., and the court didn't even ask me about the case at
the time*

I think the Pollis case is indicative of the line

of argument that I have regarding the constitutional right
of the State of California in its choice of law.
QUESTION:

It seems to ue to come as close*

factually* as any case there is* but you can't rely on it
very much.

You don't cite it.

MR. ROWE:

I didn't think it was entirely on point*

because it is one of those cases involving Workmen's Compen~
sat ion laws* and you have the Alaska Packers case and others.
QUESTION:
either

Of course* your opponent doesn't cite it

28

MR. ROWE:

No* he doesn't.

No* I don't think he

would* although the court relied on it in the Court of
Appeals and that's why I had to petition for a hearing in
the Supreme Court of the State of California.
Another point that I would like to make —
QUESTION:

Your theory is that this Respondent who

was Plaintiff below can get more money in the California court
from Nevada than Nevada would give them in Nevada?
MR. ROWE:

No* I don't think it really does* because

I can see -QUESTION

Can you imagine anything like it?

Can you imagine anything like it?

MR. ROWE

If the accident had happened in Nevada

and that we had California residents —
QUESTION:

No* no.

I said if the accident happened

in California and you sued Nevada in Nevada.
MR. ROWE:

Plight.

QUESTION:

You would get $25*000.

And if you sue

in California* you get the moon,
MR, ROWE:

I wouldn't characterize it as the moon

because this young boy suffered severe brain damage and is
retarded for the rest of his life

29

QUESTION:

I am not talking about damage* I am

talking about the amount.
MR. ROWE:

To me it is the moon.

I am not even sure that -- today what

Nevada's position is.
QUfSTION:

As I understand their position* It is

that if you want them to give up their sovereignty they give
it up on their terns* and their terms is $25*000.
MR. ROWE:

But I would like to refer to the case that

~~ I mailed a letter to the Court about the Turner v. Staggs
case* and if one can really see any implicit basic policy that
the State of Nevada now has* it seems that they interpreted
their statute to have a purpose of putting governmental tort
feasers and nongovernmental tort feasers on the same footing,
in the language of the Supreme Court of Nevada.
out their claim statute.

They threw

They didn't throw out specifically

the limitation on damages* but they threw out the claim
statute* the requirement of filing a claim.

And the basis

of the Supreme Court of Nevada doing that was they said it
is not a reasonable classification to make a distinction
between Government tort feasers and nongovernment tort
feasers* to make a distinction between victims of government
torts and victims of nongovernment torts.
Now* that's their policy.

And in a brief filed

with the Supreme Court of the United States* In that case of
Turner* the attorney for the — representing the interests

30
of the political subdivision of the State of Nevada* in his
brief in his petition for certiorari--that was 73-^89* where
this Court denied certiorari — they argued* from page 8. of the
petition for certiorari in that case* writing of the Turner
case»
i-

More importantly* however* the constitutional
rationale employed below* that is* the Supreme Court of the
State of Nevada* draws into serious question the constitution­
ality of the related statutes aimed "limiting actions against
a state and its political subdivisions»

Should private and

governmental tort feasers be unconditionally placed on equal
footing* as determined by the court" — by the Supreme Court
of Nevada — "statutes setting recovery limits prohibiting
punitive damage or exempting from liability actions by the
state militia* would for the same reason necessarily be found
to be repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause."
QUESTION:

Of course* that isn’t the reason relied

on by the Supreme Court of California* is it2 that Nevada
itself had abandoned sovereign immunity?
MR. ROWE:

No* I think the basis of their opinion

is the basis that I am arguing here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rowe* did I understand you to say

you had written a letter to the Court about some case?
MR, ROWE:

That I was going to use that particular

case in oral argument* yes.

I relied upon it and they were

31

supposed to have sent it.
sent a copy to counsel.

I can cite it to you again.

I

Turner v. Staggs» 510 Pacific 2d 879«

Certiorari denied, 414 U.S. 1079.
That case held that the stated object of the Nevada
legislation* which was 43031 — that’s their basic liability
tort claim section — was to put governmental units on an
equal footing with private tort feasers.

The Supreme Court

of Nevada,adopting language from Wright v. State Highway
Department, a Michigan case, stated that "this diverse treat­
ment of members of a class, along the lines of governmental
or private tort feasers, bears no reasonable relationship
under today’s circumstances to the recognized purposes of the
Act."
QUESTION;

This lawsuit was originally filed in

Placer County, wasn't it?
MR. ROWE:

Well, actually, it started in San Francisco,

with the Administrator being appointed in San Francisco, of
the deceased employee.

Then they raised questions concerning

the Administrator, so it was then in Placer County.

And, under

the Nevada statute, their venue statute says that the action
may be commenced in the county where the accident occurred -QUESTION;

Under the Nevada venue statute?

MR. ROWE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That would be Ormsby County, wouldn't it?

MR. ROWE:

No, there is a Subdivision 2.

It is in

The Nevada statute says that the

action has to be instituted in the county in which the acci­
dent happened, not in —
QUESTION:

Even though it is against the state?

MR. ROWE:

Even though it is against the state,

it is their own provision*
QUESTION:

Viera you found bound,suing in California

and going against their principle of sovereign immunity,
to nonetheless follow the Nevada venue provision?
MR. RCWE:

We were not bound by it, but the case

was in the county in which the accident happened until we
got a change of venue, based upon the convenience of witnesses
to Alameda County,
QUESTION;

Which is Oakland.

I suppose verdicts tend

to be higher in Oakland then they do in Placerville?
MR* ROWE:

I don't know that there has been any

statistical study of that.
QUESTION:

Would you need one?

MR. ROWE:

The basis for the move,and it was very

well documented, was by reason of convenience of witnesses.
Because all of the doctors and witnesses treating this brain­
damaged child were in the Bay Area*

For that reason, rather

than have them all come from Oakland and San Francisco and
that area to Placer County, Auburn, the court thought the
venue change should be granted.

33
There Is another question concerning -Oh* I was going to start at my very beginning before
-- to try to talk about what is not involved„

I don't feel

that there ie any real constitutional issue involved in this
case.

We don't have the legislative power of Congress to

impose suability against states involved here* which has been
a question before this Court and which has caused a great
deal of law review articles and interest throughout the
nation*

And vie don't have the question of the amenability

of the Federal Government to suits by states that was raised
as a specter by Petitioner* saying that California* if this
case was upheld, would then be suing the United States
Government* because we do have a Supremacy Clause of the
United States Constitution* Article 6, Sections 1 and 2.
And I don't think we are involved here* and it is not in­
volved in this case* the question of the judicial power of
the Federal courts, vis-a-vis the Eleventh Amendment* and
the many cases that this Court has dealt with which surround
that particular issue.
What we think is involved is basically a full faith
and credit question* at most* as raised by the other side.
)

but I think if you even assume that to be an issue the place
of the tort was State of California, the law of the forum was
California,,

So we don't have the problem of selecting between

the forum and the place of the tort because they are one and

34
the same „
We donst see any

State of California* we feel* has

the constitutional power* as 1 pointed out* to develop their
own conflict of laws doctrine.
Pearson case

And that was cited in the

which was relied on by Counsel for Petitioner.,

I think what he did was* he read the old opinion that was
later then reversed and then Judge Kaufman wrote* with* I
think* five other judges assenting with him* a new opinion*
but* I think* (inaudible) misquoted the case* saying that
we could not base the obligation upon a foreign statute and
then only take parts of it* because that was precisely the
holding in Pearson»

They said the state* under its constitu­

tional power of choice of law* has a right to reject the
Massachusetts limitation of damages, which was $15,000.
do we think that refusal to apply the limitation on
recovery is an exercise of that constitutional right.

As I

have discussed before* I don't think there is any compelling
state interest demonstrated by Nevada to require California
to apply its laws* because one of the Turner v. Staggs case*
which certainly puts a serious question on the policy of the
State of Nevada with regard to treatment of governmental
tort feasers and victims of governmental torts.
Also* the Nevada Constitution* Article 4* Section
22* does waive the immunity.

It authorizes the legislature

to enact laws to allow them to be sued.

So* I don't think

35
that he can really argue the fact of this problem of
sovereign Immunity because of the waiver in the Constitution»
QUESTION:

We could decide the case in your favor

by saying that there is no constitutional limitation on the
right of California to assert jurisdiction in situations like
this*

But# if we were to conclude along the lines that you

have Just stated# that maybe Nevada public policy isn't all
that different from the Supreme Court of California# we
couldn't affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of
California for the reasons It gave# could we?

Because it

didn't purport to consider Nevada public policy.
MR. ROWE:

I don't know what the basis of affirming

«*« I think that the Supreme Court of California did not
discuss Nevada policy.

You are correct.

It based its

opinion upon the fact# the theory that the territory#that
the action of Nevada outside of its own territory# involved
in a motor vehicle accident# driving a motor vehicle on the
California state highway# gave the California court sufficient
jurisdiction# under their long-arm statute.
And there are other cases# of course# that have
held that.

With reference to these statutes# which# of course#

this Court is familiar with# which say that the state cer­
tainly has that under its police poiver# the right to enact
such a statute.
I think one of the questions of the justices was:

36
Did this man knowingly come in?

He was directed to drive

into California; Nevada knew of the statutes of California,
which operation of a motor vehicle on their highways consti­
tuted an appointment of Secretary of State as being a person
who could be served with process against the Defendant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rowe* suppose Nevada had just stayed

pat and not waived any of its immunity?

You couldn't have

sued at all, could you?
MR, ROWE:

I think we could have* because of my

theory -- and the theory of the Supreme Court of the State
of California «- that when Nevada came into California and
conducted operations in the State of California, they were
no longer under the protection or the status of a sovereign.
And without the status of a sovereign, they could not then
raise the concept of sovereign Immunity, since only a
sovereign -QUESTION:

MR. ROWE:

It has a right to have its constitution.

It has a right to either waive or not waive immunity.

a right to set up its statutory scheme of waiver, but that's
a relationship between the governed and the governor.

Why didn't you Just --

Did you sue the employee, too?

happened is that the employee died as a result of the

An estate was commenced within the State of

California, the place of his death.

We filed a claim against

the Administrator and a complaint against the Administrator
of the estate.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Dyer* do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. DYER* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR0 DYER:

Just a few comments* Mr. Chief Justice.

First of all* our Indemnification clause was added
by the 1977 Legislature.

Prior to that* the only amount of

indemnification that would have been received would have
been under a special act of the Legislature.

Even under cur

present indemnification* it is limited to our liability
limitation.
I think the reason that the State of Nevada was
sued is obvious.

It is because of the deep-pocket theory.

With respect to Pollis* we did not cite Pollis be­
cause we do not view this case as a conflicts case.

We feel

it becomes a conflicts case only if you first determine that
we can be sued without our consent.

Because if you determine

that we have to have consented to suit* then it must go off
on our limitation.

If we can be sued without our consent*

at that time it becomes a balancing of governmental inter­
ests.

But I would point out to the Court that even in that

situation we have provided for California*s interests to be
protected by allowing recovery up to a specified limitation,
And I might also add that there was insurance on the "

that one had to first file a claim with the Nevada Secretary
of State* within six; months of the action in order to maintain

It overruled

NK3 41039, which is one of nine specific statutory sections
dealing with our statutory limitation.

It simply stands for

the proposition that you cannot have a situation where private
tort feasers can sue without filing a claim and public tort
feasers or people who are torted by the public# by the
Government, must file a claim within six months after the
accident happens.
Who knows what the answer would have been in the
