E.5.2.9.1.5.2.LN2S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 349, the United States against
Helstoski, and the consolidated case.
Mr. Stavis, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON STAVIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 78-546
AND RESPONDENT IN 78-349
MR. STAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The two cases here —. No. 546, our petition, and the
349, the Solicitor General's petition — the facts in both
cases are quite simple.
546, which I will deal with first, involves the
jurisdiction of the district court to try this indictment.
The facts there are, obviously, the indictment
itself, which charges a member of Congress with taking money
and conspiring to take money for introducing bills in Congress,
bills which the indictment charges were in fact introduced,
and the bills that are specifically identified in the
indictment.
It is plain from the face of the indictment the
grand jury which found it heard, considered and relied upon
proof of a performance of legislative acts.
And while it is not clear from the face of the
indictment, it is established in the opinion of Judge Meaner,

4
and undisputed, that the indicting grand jury — which is the
grand jury which handed down this indictment — received proofs
of the performance of legislative acts from the United States
Attorney, not from Mr. Helstoski.
It is also clear and undisputed that while Mr.
Helstoski gave legislative materials to earlier grand juries —
not the indicting grand jury — he had no reason to believe at
the time that he gave such materials that he was the target
of the grand jury; and in fact, somebody else was thereafter
indicted, tried and convicted.
QUESTION:

Of course, it wouldn't make any difference

to your theory if he had, would it?
MR. STAVIS:

If he was a target?

QUESTION:

If he was aware that he was —

QUESTION:

And knew he was.

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

To our fundamental theory, it doesn't.
It might have something to do with

MR. STAVIS:
waiver, either.

waiver.

I don't, think it has anything to do with

But I agree.

If our theory is correct, that

this is a jurisdictional allocation, then it xrouldn't make
any difference at all.
QUESTION:

Mho was the other oerson under inquiry?

Another member of Congress?
MR. STAVIS:

No, no, somebodv who had been employed

by the Congressman some eight years previously, was not then

5

employed and hadn't been employed for many, many years.
Now, our position in 546 is — and you put your
finger right on it — that the court had no jurisdiction to
try this indictment.
And if the Court agrees with us on that, of course,
it doesn't have to reach the evidentiary issues which are
involved with 349.
Now, I'm not going to attempt to match the eloquence
of this Court in its eight opinions dealing with the Speech
and Debate Clause, and review or recount the history of that
clause and its meaning in England and the United States.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stavis, are you going to get at all

to the appealability of Judge Mean^r's order by the government?
I notice that you attack it in the Third Circuit, but neither
party apparently contests it here.
It would seem to me that it is not open and shut
that that was an appealable order.
MR. STAVIS:

Well, I — we — in the Third Circuit,

we certainly didn’t believe that it was an appealable order.
We moved to dismiss before the Third Circuit on those grounds.
The Third Circuit denied our motion.

I must confess that we

did not cross-petition.
It may very well be appropriate to the Court to
address that question on its own motion.
QUESTION:

Well, we have jurisdiction of the Court of

6

Appeals® opinion — judgment — only if it was properly in the
Court of Appeals,
MR. STAVIS:

I don't think this matter was properly

in the Court of Appeals.

Candidly, I don't think the issue

which the government presented in its petition are even properly
before this Court, because the entire factual foundation for
the government's petition in 349 is a series of proposed
proffers of proof which they asked the district court to rule on
three times; and the district court refused to do so.
So there are no facts before this Court, and 349 is a
wholly and entirely supposititious case.

And in that respect,

I guess I don't have to call to your attention —- the attention
of the Court — the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun
concurred in by the Chief Justice only last week, in the
Portash case, in which he addressed the question — the proposition that this Court oughtn't to be handling supposititious
cases; that there's enough business handling concrete issues.
And while the other seven members of the Court didn't agree
that that principle applied to that case, there's no question
that this Court ordinarily tries and adjudicates onl^ concrete
cases.
QUESTION:

Well, that I gather — that's a case-in­

controversy argument, but I understand, Mr. Stavis, you’re
suggesting that even though you did not cross-petition on
the question of the appealability of the order to the Third

7
Circuit, that it's jurisdictional and therefore that we can
reach it in deciding —
MR. STAVIS:

I accepted the suggestion of Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

I just wanted to be clear.

That — now the argument you're now making is
really a case-in-controversy argument?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

That's correct.
And that’s a separate argument?
That's correct.
All right.
May I get back to the issues in 546,

which is the jurisdiction of this Court to — of a district
court, of an Article III court — to try this indictment.
That the Speech and Debate Clause establishes
jurisdictional allocation comes all through the decisions of
this Court, including its latest? and that is, of course, the
Chief Justice's opinion in Eastman against Syracuse.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

For the Court.
I’m sorry?
Opinion for the Court.
Of course; the opinion for the Court.

And what you addressed there was the fact that the Speech and
Debate Clause affects the availability of judicial power.
Now the corollary to approaching this matter from

8

the point of view of jurisdiction, or the availability of
judicial power is that no one says that members of Congress are
super-citizens, and that the Speech or Debate Clause gives
them free license to take bribes and commit crimes and
introduce bills that are paid for.
The only question is:
house?

/

Which is the proper court­

Is it an Article III court?

Or is it the Congress of

the United States, under both the Speech and Debate Clause and
the punishment clause?
And so that there's no question about it, my client
never has, does not now, nor will he, contest the jurisdiction
of the Congress of the United States to try the charges which
we are involved with here„
He‘3 not exactly looking to be charged by any —
QUESTION:
MR. STAVXS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

Can they try these charges now?
I believe so.
And what sanction could Congress impose?
As I read Kilbourn v. Thompson, Congress

has complete power to impose any sanctions it chooses,
including — if I read Kilbourn v. Thompson correctly —
imprisonment.
That's what you said in Kilbourn.
QUESTION:

I suppose under the Constitution it

wouldn't be authorized to impose a cruel or unusual
punishment?

9
MR. STAVIS:

Oh, I think there are constitutional

limitations on the exercise of its power.

That's Powell

against McCormack.
We expect that if we are tried on this by Congress,
we expect to insist on a due process hearing, and a whole
panoply or rights that would be applied to any judicial
hearing; and that would be a judicial hearings.

It's just an

exception to Article III jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

Are you going to insist on a jury trial?

MR. STAVIS;

No, no we don't expect to insist on a.

jury trial.
QUESTION;

Although the constitution guarantees

that, doesn't it?
MR. STAVIS;

It guarantees it in an Article III

trial. I do not believe —
QUESTION:

It doesn't say anything about an Article

III trial, does it?
MR. STAVIS:

Well, I would guess, however, that we

would accept the fact that it would not be a jury trial.

If

we were entitled to a jury trial, we would waive it.
I think the essence of the punishment clause is
that the Congress itself has that power.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS;
QUESTION;

Subject to what constitutional limitations?
Subject to due process limitations —
Bat not a jury trial?

10

MR. STAVIS:

That8s correct.

Subject to cruel and

unusual punishment limitations.
QUESTION:

Presumption of innocence?

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Presumption of innocence.
Necessity of proof beyond a reasonable

doubt?
MR. STAVIS:

I would believe so.

Right of confron­

tation? right of cross-examination; right of counsel.
«

QUESTION:

Mr. Sfcavis, is it clear that thatclause

applies to a former Congressman?
MR. STAVIS:

Congress in the past has so asserted.

We do not dispute that.
And besides, as of the time that thi3 indictment was
found, Mr. Kelstoski was a member of Congress.
QUESTION:

Yes, but he's not now, and any punishment

by Congress would be from now on.
MR. STAVIS:

That is correct.

And we do not dispute

the jurisdiction of Congress.
But the point that I'm making here —
QUESTION:

Well, you don't here, because you don't

have to.
MR. STAVIS:

That is correct.

All we have to dispute

here is the jurisdiction of the Article III court.
QUESTION:
jurisdiction

That the Federal courts don't have any

11

MR. STAVIS:

And at che time that this indictment

was found, Congress clearly had jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, what would the — is there a

statute of limitations on that?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

I don't know that there is any.
Well, Mr. Stavis, what — you say Congress

has asserted authority to try after his defeat, which I gather
is what happened to this Congressman.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

That is correct.
Has that ever happened?
Yes, it has.
Against whom?

»

Well, Mr. Brand speaking for the

Speaker, will address that particular question.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

Oh, I see.
Historically, it has occurred.

I think,

in fact, it occurred in the most famous corruption investigation
by the Congress in the Credit Mobilier transaction, where
?

85

Congress Oakes Ames was charged, tried and convicted by the
House after he was no longer sitting.
And 1 think there are a number of other examples of
that sort.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stavis, would the net result of

accepting your theory mean that the Congress could not enact,
and the President sign, a law making it a criminal offense for

12

a Congressman to take a bribe?
MR. STAVIS:

Congress has enacted such a law, and

such a law is on the books and has been in force and is valid,
but not with respect to the performance of legislative acts.
In other words, the Johnson case — which wasn’t in
fact tried under that section — is a perfect example.

A

Congressman takes a bribe to try to influence the Department
of Justice.

A normal conflict of interest situation, or to

take a bribe for an act which is not a legislative act in
nature.
What the Speech and Debate Clause is driving at is,
that if you want to try a legislative act — fraud in connection
with a legislative act; if you want to try the legislative
process; that belongs in the Congress.
If you want to try just the question of bribery,
not implicating the legislative process, that you may do in
an Article IXIcourt.
QUESTION;

But when —• Mr. Stavis, when the charge

is for taking money in exchange for a promise of a future
act, hasn't the Court held that it's not necessary to show
the legislative act or the legislative activity?
MR. STAVIS;

And of course that's your opinion in the

Brewster case; that’s exactly what the Court held.
And the whole point of the government’s taking this
case is, that they want to get around that decision.

Because

in that decision you said at least eight times -- we counted

13

^em -- that under the Brewster indictment, you could not show
the actual performance of a legislative act.
QUESTION;

Well, how will ’^e know whether the

government is going to try to prove that until the case is
tried?
MR. STAVIS:

Well, that's what we thought, excepting

that the government — and that's why we think you ought not
even consider this case — that the government says, "Please
look at our proffers of proof.

This is really what we want to

prove."
We said, "Those people aren't even going to testify
that way; let alone the fact that if they did testify, it
(

wouldn't be true."
But the government is asking you to make — asking
the district court and asking you to make rulings on advance
evidentiary proof.
QUESTION:

You said — did I understand you to say

you didn't want us to hear this case?
MR. STAVIS:

I didn't want you to hear the govern­

ment's petition.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVTS:

*
Oh, I see.
don't want you to hear the government's

petition»; I sure want you to hear my petition.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS

I see.
Because my petition -—

14
QUESTION:

I just marvel at your fairness.

[Laughter.]
MR. STAVIS:

Well, I think it's not only fair, but

correct.
But let me get back, Mr. Chief Justice, to your
question.

Because you said that in Brewster, and you looked

at an indictment that did not charge the performance of
legislative acts.
Look at this indictment.

On its face, it charges the

specific performance of designated and named legislative acts.
Now if this case goes to trial, and if you prove -if the government is permitted to prove the fact as alleged
in this indictment — I5m not talking about what would have
happened if they came up with a Brewster indictment — but if
they prove the facts alleged in this indictment, that jury is
going to be asked to decide questions as to the functioning of
the

legislative process, specifically.
QUESTION:

What if the trial court excludes any

evidence about the legislative acts?
MR. STAVIS:

Well, that's what — that's what Judge

Meanor said he was going to do .

And that's why the government

took this case up; they weren't satisfied with Judge Meanor*s
decision, which said, "I read the Brewster opinion, and I
intend to enforce it and not permit the introduction of
legislative acts."

And the government took it up.

That's why this case has been going on now for

15
2-1/2 years without a trial.
Nov; — but I want to emphasize that our position
is that in the light of this indictment, the issue does not
end with the fact that the government would not be permitted to
introduce that evidence at trial.
And that's what my position is about.

I say that

the grand jury, released and found an indictment which on its
face is beyond the jurisdiction of this court.
And what the government is saying is, "Well, let's
fix up the indictment a little bit.

Maybe they shouldn't

have charged and alleged these legislative acts which they
designate in that, indictment.

We'll just strike it up.

Fix

it up and make it like the Brewster-type indictment, and
forget that it ever happened."
QUESTION:

Mr. Stavis, do you agree that if they

strike the allegations of the specific overt acts describing
legislative acts, that the indictment would then be comparable
to the indictment in the Brewster case?
MR. STAVIS:

It's a little bit more than a specific

legislative act; it's also the allegations in counts two,
three and four of theindictment, which also include allegations
of specific legislative acts.
Yet the answer is, if all those words were taken
out, then you'd have an indictment that read like the Brewster
indictment.

16
But the trouble about doing that is, that by the
issuance of the indictment, the executive branch of the
government -- the executive branch of the government — has
implicated — the executive branch of government and the
grand jury — have implicated and impugned the functioning of
Congress.
And the point that we make is when the Speech and
Debate Clause set out to protect this delicate tripartite
separation of powers —
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Stavis, would you say then

that if, before the defendant is put into jeopardy, the
government had come in and voluntarily dismissed the indict­
ment — got permission to dismiss the indictment — and then
-Le---i.ndicted,

leaving out all the references to legislative

acts —
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION;

No problem about that.
Well, they still would have done what

you just said.
MR. STAVIS:
difference

Mo, provided that — and this is the

provided that it had not presented the legis­

lative acts to the grand jury.
QUESTION:

An, so that having presented the legis­

lative acts to the grand jury, they have given him permanent
immunity?
MR. STAVIS:

No, they haven’t.

There's nothing in

tx.ie world that says they can't call another grand jury and

17
present a case to another grand jury.

That's exactly what

happened in the Lawn case.
In the Lawn case, decided by this Court —
QUESTION:

Well, then your position is — just so I

get it — is that having told a particular grand jury about
a legislative act by a Congressman,

that grand jury may never

return an indictment against that Congressman?
MR. STAVIS:

Indictment which charges legislative

acts.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said a moment ago if

they dismissed the indictment and brought a new one which
didn’t make reference, it would still be bad.
MR. STAVIS:

I know, what I mean is that they can’t —

I mean, obviously, they can indict him for bank robbery.

They

may be able to indict him.
QUESTION:

No, they just excise from the new indict­

ment any reference to the legislative acts, and they merely
follow the pattern of the Brewster indictment.
MR. STAVIS:

That would be invalid, because the grand

jury -- the grand jury has violated the Speech and Debate
Clause„
But this is not to say that the government cannot
convene another grand jury, present a case which does not
involve proof of legislative acts, and come out with a
Brewster-type of indictment.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but that's like Calandra.

Once the information has been presented to the grund
jury, there’s nothing more that can be done to salvage tne
speech and debate clause»
The question is whether the indictment it returns is
constitutional or not.

The idea that if you presented dif~

ferent information to another grand jury, somehow you could
call it back — call the earlier proceedings back, isn’t
pbssible.
MR. STAVIS:

It is not like Calandra.

a very different kind of a case.

In

Calandra

Calandra

is

you

decided that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the exclusionary
clause, which is your making, that you would allow a grand
jury to hear evidence unlawfully seized by somebody else.
QUESTION:

And we also said in Calandra

that the

right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment had already
been breached, and there was nothing —■
MR. STAVIS:

I understand that.

But here you have

an explicit provision of the speech — of the constitution —
which says that speech or debate — by which we mean legislative
acts— shall not be questioned in any other place.
And in Gravel you said, that includes a grand jury.
QUESTION:

Did it say, he may not be questioned, or

he need — ha may not,be required to answer?
MR. STAVIS:

Says he may not be questioned.

19

QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Yeah, and he may not —
I think it says, may not be questioned.
Now, did he have to respond to anything

in the grand jury?
MR. STAVIS:

I think he did, at the point where he

wasn't the target.
As I read Gravel -—
QUESTION:

Well, a lot of non-target witnesses

before a grand jury claim immunity from responding for
various reasons, depending -MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

On the Fifth Amendment grounds.
Yes, but there might be another reason

here then, wouldn't there?
MR. STAVIS;

Might be, but if I read the Gravel

case accurately — and I think I do — there is no speech
and debate protection from questioning when the grand jury
is investigating third party crimes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stavis, am I right that your client

voluntarily gave the legislative stuff to the grand jury?
M». STAVIS:
QUESTION:

He gave it to them voluntarily —
So is that — do you take the position

that if a Congressman is up for anything, and he voluntarily
gives legislative things, he can't be indicted from then on?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

He wasn't —
He's immunised forever?

20

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

He wasn’t up for anyfchinq.
Yeah, but he volunteered it, didn’t he?

He did.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

He was subpoened to testify.
Did he or didn’t he bring these bills

there?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

He was subpoened to testify —
And didn't he bring the bills there?
That is correct.
Didn't he bring the legislative matters

there.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And now he complains about bringing them

there.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Because he —
And now he complains about bringing them

there.
MR. STAVIS:

He doesn't complain about bringing

them there.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

What does he complain about?
He was required to bring them there.

doesn't complain about that at all.
What he complains about is some grand jury1 that he
never brought them before.
him -

And -- which turned and targeted

He

21

QUESTION:

Sure, he would have been immunized from

robbing a bank in the State of Alaska.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I say exactly the contrary.
I'm not too sure you wouldn't go so far

as to say he'd be immunized from robbing a bank in Great
Britain.
MR. STAVIS:

Your Honor, I said exactly the contrary.

I said that quite the contrary, he is subject to prosecution
in an Article III court by a grand jury which doesn't
have this material.
He is subject to prosecution before Congress where
this material may properly be the subject of inquiry by the
court which has jurisdiction.
So I do not accept the suggestion, Your Honor,
because I think I've said exactly the contrary.
May I reserve some of my time?
QUESTION:

Does it not sometimes happen, Mr. Stavis,

that the prosecution fails to prove all of what is alleged
in an indictment, and yet a conviction nevertheless results?
MR. STAVIS:
happens.

Of course it's — of course that's what

But; those are not cases where you're dealing with

an express constitutional prescription —
QUESTION:

Now this trial judge ha3 indicated that

he will — in advance — have the advantage of his statement
that he will not admit any testimony on that score.

22

MR. STAVIS:

That he intends to comply with Brewster.

But I just — our position is that the indictment
is already a violation of the speech or debate clause.
QUESTION;

And therefore he can never be tried under

this indictment.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION;

Under this indictment.
And this indictment has to be dismissed,

is your view?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And if he's to be indicted, he has to be

indicted by a new grand jury which does not hear the evidence
that you say violated the -MR. STAVIS:

And that's not any different than what

you —
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

Well, that is your position?
That is correct.

That's precisely the

position.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

What about the statute of limitations?
I'm sorry?
What about the statute of limitations?
I think there's an express provision

of the statutes which provides that where an

indictment is

voided for some reason not having to do with the merits of
the offense, that the statute of limitations is tolled.
I think there's an express provision in the United
States Code.

23

QUESTION: Can you give me an idea xvhere it is?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

No, but I'll be glad to furnish it.
If you give me an idea, I can find it.

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

It's in the United States Code.
Good.

[Laughter.]
MR. STAVIS:

But there's an express provision — I

looked that up thinking about this case, and I did look it up.
QUESTION:

Well, the fact that you didn't remember

it makes me think it might not help you too much.
MR. STAVIS:

Well, it doesn't help me in the sense

that a new indictment can be brought, as I have suggested.

In

that sense it doesn't help me.
But it also makes clear the suggestion I5ve made as
to the potentialities of a new indictment, is entirely
feasible.
And I just want to say, in reference to Mr. Justice
Brennan's question, that of course is exactly whatyou do in
an immunity case.

You forbid the use of immunized testimony.

You impose upon the prosecutor an obligation to establish that
he didn't use

immunized testimony when he got the indictment.

If he can't make it, he can go to another grand
jury.

He can go to another grand jury and get an indictment

without the use of immunized testimony; does that all the
time.

24
QUESTION:

Is there any case from this court saying

that an indictment returned — that the government didn't
show it was not used based on immunized testimony, isn't
valid?
MR. STAVIS:

I think Lawn comes close to that.

In Lawn what you said was —
QUESTION:

Could you answer yes or no?

MR. STAVIS:

I'm not sure I could put my fingers on a

case at the moment„
May I reserve some time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Stavis.

One question before you do.

You mentioned the jurisdiction over former members
would be covered in your colleague's argument.

But as I look

in his brief, he gives us an example of five former members
over whom ^Congress said they did not have jurisdiction.
Maybe he will cover that, but I would like to be
advised on that.
MR. STAVIS:

i

think he's given an example of cases

in which former members of Congress were —
QUESTION:

You don't happen to know such a case

yourself?
MR. STAVIS:

Other than the Oakes Ames case, which

I mentioned.
QUESTION:

That was back in Grant's time.

25
QUESTION:

Could you give me that again?

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Oakes-Ames, Congressman —
Oakes and Ames?

MR. STAVIS — Ames, involved in the Credit Mobilier
controvery.

That was around the 1870’s, I think.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. STAVIS: That was the biggest scandal case in
Congress at the time.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Brand.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. BRAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THOMAS P, O'NEILL, SPEAKER,
ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE
MR. BRAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I'm here representing the Honorable Thomas P.
O’Neill, Speaker; the Honorable Frank Thompson, Chairman; and
the Honorable William Dickinson, ranking Minority Member,
Committee on House Administration of the U.S. House of
Representatives, as amici curiae.
The interests of the Speaker and his colleagues in
this case is apparent.

It presents serious questions, in our

minds, as to the continued viability of the speech and debate

clause.
At. the outset, I’d like to make one point clear:

The

26
Congress has read Johnson and Brewster, and the Congress
accepts Johnson and Brewster.
When we saw the Solicitor's petition, however, and
what we viewed as an attempt to re-litigate Brewster, we were
concerned.

And that's why we are here.
To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson's characterization of

the clause, which he wrote shortly after the adoption of the
constitution, the clause i3 intended to protect the substance,
rather than the shadow, of representative government; and for
that reason, it states, "for any speech or debate, they shall
not be questioned in any other place."
We believe that this clause operates as an insti­
tutional protection as well as a personalized privilege, and to
effect this high principle of an unfettered legislative branch,
the framers concluded that a jurisdictional

allocation was

necessary.
And we read this jurisdictional allocation fromthe
Speech or Debate clause, read together with the punishment
clause.

Lika other jurisdictional requirements, the trial of

of legislative acts must occur in the proper foriam.
It is not subject to waiver.

Congressman Helstoski

cannot waive himself into an Article III court for the trial
of legislative acts.
QUESTION:

In other words, even if he had voluntarily

submitted all this material —

27

MR• BRAND;
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

That's our
— regarding these legislative —
That's our position.

QUESTION:

Even that —

QUESTION:

Even if he'd made an unequivocal explicit

waiver, knowing waiver, voluntarily?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

Yes, anymore than two —
He was just not empowered to waive it?
Anymore than two litigants could present

themselves to an Article III court without a case at contro­
versy, and say, "We would like the court, nevertheless, to
try this case."
QUESTION;

In other words, the Speech or Debate clause

doesn't belong to an individual, it belongs to an institution;
is that your ooint?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, if it does, why can't that insti-

tution provide for its waiver?
MR. BRAND:

Because the clause is a protection for

the member as well, even against a hostile Congress.
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

So it's both?
That's correct.
Neither one can —
It protects unpopular members as well as

popular members, Democrats as well as Republicans

28

QUESTION?

So Congress cannot, by however narrow a

piece of legislation —
MR. BRAND;
QUESTION:

That's right.
-- provide for the —

MR. BRAND;
QUESTION:

Any —
— the executive prosecution of a legis­

lative act?
MR. BRAND;

That's right; anymore than we could dele­

gate impeachment, for instance.
OUESTION:

Mr. Brand, Congress, I assume, could amend

the 201 and the other bribery statute and say, "They do not
apply to Congress."
MR. BRAND

%

They could do that.

Our position would be —
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND;
QUESTION:

Well, aren't you

now doing that?

No, sir, we don't believe x^e are.
Well, aren't you trying to get us to do

that?
MR. BRAND:

I don't think so.

What we're saying — as you said in Brewster -these cases can go forward without impugning legislative acts.
And. that's all we're saying here.
QUESTION:

Do you challenge the indictments, Mr.

Brand, or just the evidentiary —
MR. BRAND:

We do.

29

QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

You agree with Mr. Stavis?
We do in this case.

Although we agree

also that there is nothing to prevent the U„S. Attorney from
taking the non-legislative material; presenting it to a
new grand jury; and indicting and going forward to trial.
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

Except maybe the statute of limitations?
If that, in fact, is a problem.

But —
QUESTION:

But you would, in that new indictment,

or in those new grand jury proceedings, or in the subsequent
trial, the evidence, the government now proposes to use you
would say would be unuseable?
MB. BRAND:
QUESTION:

Correct.
Hasn't Congress —■ or didn't Congress

take quite a long step in relation to the Speech and Debate
Clause when they enacted these provisions?
MR. BRAND:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

201, like a plethora of other statutes regulating
non-legislative behavior, has been passed by Congress in
that context.
We have statutes, for instance, 18 U.S.C. 431, says
that a member may not enter into a contract in which the
United States is a party.

That's not a legislative act.

We

regulate that by statute.
We regulate campaign financing, because we say that

30

when a member takes a political contribution, or campaigns
for office, he is not engaging in a legislative process»

And

we regulate that, through the United States Code.
I don’t believe you can read 201 in the context of
the U.S. Code, and the other ways in which we regulate
members’ conduct, as the one example where we have attempted
to put info Article III courts the trial of legislative acts»
I don't believe that’s consistent with the design of
the code at this time»
At this point, we come to the question of the
indictment.

We would say that there having been neither a

waiver, nor a delegation under 201, the indictment at issue
here, which

charges legislative acts, on the basis of what

the grand jury, is fatally defective.

And we asay this for

several reasons.
This is not Calandra

and the Fourth Amendment,

This

is not Costello and the Fifth Amendment,
This is the Speech and Debate Clause, which is part
of the constitution which the framers placed in the constitu­
tion, to protect questioning, at the earliest possible
juncture —• not after indictment —■ when the death blow has
been dealt, as in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, to prevent questioning anywhere,

in any other place.
MR. BRAND:

Correct.

31

QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't your interests be

served by according a Congressman a right to assert before the
grand jury the privilege that you're talking about now?
MR. BRAND:

Our- position would not deny him that.
♦

The grand jury which indicted him —
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it be totally clear, if he

chooses not to assert it, then there is form of waiver?
MR. BRAND:

Well, if it's never asserted, it never—

never becomes an issue.

But in thise case, the grand jury

which ultimately indicted him was one which there could be
no waiver because he never appeared before that grand jury.
What we're saying on the indictment issue is, that
the indictment is defective, because the design of the Speech
or Debate Clause is to prevent questioning.
If the questioning has already occurred, and you
are willing to say that we will only, at trial, put on some
evidentiary prescriptions, then you havenot remedied the
potential abuse which exists.
QUESTION:

But what was the questioning before the

grand jury which violated the Speech and Debate Clause?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:

The legislative acts.

It doesn't --

But to whom were the questions addressed?

MR. BRAND:

I believe they were directed to the

QUESTION:

Well, but why couldn't he then assert

defendant.

32

the Speech and Debate privilege, and fully vindicate it by
asserting it at that point, and not having done so, he has
waived it?
MR. BRAND:

Well, under Mr. Stavis5 formulation —

and I think we would agree with most of that — a member must
answer as to third party crime before a grand jury.
QUESTION:

But as soon as it reached him, is it not

implied in both Johnson and the Brewster case, that he not
only —• need not answer, he may assert the proposition that he
may not be questioned.
I'll give you an example:

If he were sued in a

complaint in a civil case for libel, and the complaint
alleged that the libel was committed on the floor of the
House, could not the member of Congress simply informally
tell the court, by letter or any other way, that he was not
going to answer, because the Speech and Debate Clause
protected him, and that he 'was not going to appear; and that
any judgment entered on the basis of that complaint %*ould be
a nullity under the Speech or Debate Clause?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:

Wall, as I —
So that he — it is more than a matter

of not being questioned, or not answering.

He can’t even

be questioned; isn’t that so?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Well, but he then submitted to the

33

questioning here.
MR. BRAND:

Well, wouldn't he be — wouldn't the

same situation occur where he never appeared, and the U.S.
Attorney went to the library of Congress, and took the
legislative material out of there.
Is that a questioning?

He would never have appeared

to assert the privilege, yet we would assert that that's
prohibited.
QUESTION?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:

Well, indeed, you're —
That the grand jury can't hear —
I thought your assertion was that even

if he appeared, and answered freely, nevertheless —
MR. BRAND;

That's correct.

As a claimant in an

Article III court, he could come in and claim that he should
get a remedy from the court.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Brand, you certainly don't

mean to — I know you say that the evidence should never even
have been presented to the grand jury.

But even if —■ even

if there was ~ even if it was properly presented, or even if
it could be said that he waived, in some manner, the
presentation of the evidence, you 3tili say that he never
consented to be indicted; never consented to be threatened
with indictment; and. that would,

of course, solve an awful

lot of your problems if you went on that.
MR. BRAND:

Well, again, I believe the heart of the

34

clause is protection of the Congress from a coordinate branch.
QUESTION;

And I gathered — I thought your position

was, that so far does that principle go, that nothing that he
does before the grand jury cars support an indictment?
MR. BRAND;

Correct.

QUESTION;

Nothing.

Isn’t that it?

QUESTION;

Mr. Brand, he didn’t testify before this

grand jury, did he?
MR. BRAND;
QUESTION;

The one that he was indicted by?
Yes.

He didn’t testify before that grand

jury?
MR. BRAND;
QUESTION;

He did not.
So your position has to be that evidence

of legislative acts is inadmissible before the grand jury,
even though the man himself —
MR. BRAND;

Yes.

QUESTION; But the clause doesn't read that way.

It

says that the Congressman shall not be questioned in any other
place.

It doesn’t say the evidence of legislative acts shall

not be admissible

before a grand jury.

MR. BRAND:
QUESTION;

Well, of course —
In fact you mentioned ~ even acknowledge

that with third party crime, evidence of legislative acts would
be proper.
MR. BRAND:

Well, of course, the clause doesn't say

either that it is merely that it shall not be presented.

We

35

would read, "shall not be questioned," to include the
questioning of his legislative acts, whether he is the author
or not.
QUESTION:

Well, he wasn't questioned in that grand

jury, was he?
MR. BRAND:

In the indicting grand jury, he was

not.
QUESTION:

But at the time a grand jury is conducting

its investigations, it presumably doesn’t have its mind made
up what it's going to do at the end of the inquiry.
Does it have to stop everytime somebody proposes to
introduce before it a legislative act, and decide whether or
not it can be recieved based upon what it's ultimately going to
decide with respect to whom it may indict?
MR. BRAND:

But in this case there was a mechanism

for culling out the legislative act by presenting -- the
U.S. Attorney, by presenting them to the ■— by not presenting
them to the indicting grand jury.
There was a mechanism, but it wasn't used.
QUESTION:

May I ask you one other question?

Is it your view that the Congress retains jurisdiction
to punish former members?
MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

Yes.
And what is your authority for that?
Well, our authority would be the residual —

36
)0

the inherent power of the body

'

contempts

committed by its members at the time they were members, for
conduct which occurred when they were members.
QUESTION:

Has the Congress -- is it not true that

your brief recites an example of three members over whom it
did not have — former members

over whom it did not have

jurisdiction?
MR. BRAND:

Well,, that report raised doubts as to

whether there was jurisdiction.

And those

cases against

those former members were dropped for other reasons.
QUESTION:

The military once asserted jurisdiction to

punish its former members too, but it got a negative answer
from this court, didn’t it?
MR, brand:

I believe it did.

We're talking,, again, about what we would say is
the inherent power of the body to punish members, not as
private citizens, but for conduct which occured in a body
when they were —
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

When they were members„
— when they were members.

QUESTION:

That was the military’s theory, too.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sfcavis indicated that you were going

to tell us about the number of Congressmen —• former
Congressmen ~~ punished by the House, or the Senate.
MR. BRAND:

Yes.

37
The House has doubted its authority, it’s true, as
this Court cited in Powell v, McCormack,

its authority to

expel a member for conduct which occurred before he became a
member of Congress.
But it has not doubted its power to punish conduct
occurring in a prior Congress.
QUESTION:
MR. BRAND:

As was indicated by Mr. Stavls •

By a man who is no longer a member?
No; in that case, he was a member of the

42nd Congress.
QUESTION:

So you say that the past Congress doubted

its power to punish conduct occurring in a former Congress by a
man who is no longer a member?
MR. BRAND:

I’m not 3ure if it's ever expressed

any view on that.
Our view of the self-disciplinary process as it is
evolving at this stage is that we would have the power —
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Brand, is there any instance

of a former Congressman being tried by the Congress, House or
Senate, for conduct violating —
MR. BRAND:

There is none that I can cite you.

I can cite you none.
QUESTION:

Well, what about -- I thought Mr. Stavis

indicated there was an
MR. BRAND:
scandal,

instance.

Is that right or not?

Well, he talked about the Credit Mobilier

38
QUESTION:

What about that?

MR. BRAND:

And that was discipline in the 42nd

Congress for what occurred in the 40th.
QUESTION:

Are they incumbent Congressmen?

MR. BRAND:
QUESTION:

Of a sitting member of Congress.
I see.

MR. BRAND:

I see that my time is up.

If the Chief Judge would indulge me for one minute,
I would simply state thatthe self-disciplinary process is an
evolving process.

To say that the legislative acts will go

unpunished is not correct.
Legislative misbehavior and misconduct is not
immunized.

The House has taken cognizance of acts committed

by its members which impugn the integrity of the process.
It's an evolving process; it is not static.

We

are currently considering proposals, for instance, to empanel
grand juries of members on a random basis.

We are proceeding

apace with the self-disciplinary process—
QUESTION:

Does the record-, Mr. Brand, tell us

whether the Congress has given any consideration as to
whether any action should be taken against former Congressman
Helstoski?
MR. BRAND:

No, sir.

And I would leave with this thought, that the
Solicitor ha3 indicated in his brief that the Congress can't

39

do both:
late.

They can't discipline appropriately and also legis­

I believe the record is clear that we can discipline

with justice through law, that we can do it with due process;
that we can do it with a full panoply of protections and
shields that apply in a criminal case; witness the material
we submitted for the record on that.,
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Brand.

Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCRSE, JR. , ESQ.,
SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES,
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, ON BEHALF OF
THE RESPONDENT IN 4546 and PETITIONER
IN 349.
GENERAL McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In June, 1976, respondent was indicted in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
on several charges arising out of grand jury investigations
into alleged corruption in connection with private immigration
legislation.
Count one charged him, as a member of the Congress,
with conspiracy to violate the official bribery statute,
that's 18 U.S.C. Section 201(c)(1), by acting with Albert
DeFalco, his former administrative aide, and others, to

40

solicit and to receive bribes in return for being influenced
to introduce private bills in the House of Representatives.
Thirteen overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy
were alleged, and these overt acts consisted of charges that
respondent and his administrative aide met with attorneys
who specialized in immigration litigation, and from whom they
received cash payments in return for bills for named aliens.
The other three overt acts with which we're concerned
here, two three and four, also allege the actual introduction
of such bills.
QUESTION:

And in your view, Mr. Solicitor General,

for the government to sustain its case, need it prove any
more than that the money was taken, and the promise to do a
future act was made?
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

That —

In other words, does it need that the

bargain was fulfilled?
GENERAL McCREE:

That's precisely the

government's

position, if the Court please.
The offense was to solicit bribes to perform an
official act.
solicited.

And the offense is complete once the bribe is

And it is unnecessary to show that an official

act was, in fact, done in response.
QUESTION:

Mould the crime be consummated if the

solicitation were shown but no payment were shown?

41
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

The act —

Or refused to pay?

GENERAL McCREE:

If the Court please, it would be,

under 201, the Act is, in fact, completed when the solicitation
is made for the ournose of being influenced.
QUESTION:

But Mr. Solicitor, I gather — Judge

Meanor said you could not use the evidence of those private
bills actually being introduced.
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

That's exactly —

And you disagree with that?

GENERAL McCREE:

I do not -- we do not disagree with

Judge Meanor, if a waiver took place.

We agree that Judge

Meanor is correct that we could not show the introduction of
the bills, which is the showing of legislative acts, unless
a valid waiver occurred.
But we contend —
QUESTION:

Occurred when, and how?

GENERAL McCREE:

We submit that a valid waiver

occurred when Mr. Ilelstoski voluntarily presented voluminous
correspondence, including copies of the very bills that he
introduced, after he was told that he needn't
was not required to do that.

that he

And he did it voluntarily, and

as Judge Meanor found, he knew of his speech or debate privi­
lege when he did it, although it was not called directly to
his attention.

42

He had raised this privilege in other litigation
involving the alleged abuse of the franking privilege, and
in fact, in his penultimate appearance before the grand jury,
he also invoked the speech or debate privilege.
And so Judge Meanor1s finding that ha knew it is
amply supported.

And the U.S. Attorney told him that he did

not have to submit these matters.
QUESTION:

But just so I get it clear.

But absent

the waiver, you agree that under Brewster and the relevant
cases, and under the clause, you could not introduce the
evidence that you propose to introduce?
GENERAL McCREE:

We do.

We concede that.

As a matter of fact, the — I’d like to move perhaps
right on to the next — the evidence that is involved here.
We think that this evidence falls into three categories!
First, the bills themselves, which I guess respondent — are
clearly legislative acts; evidence of legislative acts.
And absent a waiver, we agree that we could not introduce
those.
There’s a second category of evidence, and this
consists of correspondence between Helstoski, DeFalco, some
of the attorneys who represented some of the aliens, and some
of the aliens themselves.
We submit that this evidence has to be examined by
the district court on an item-by-item basis, to see whether

43

it —
QUESTION:

Wall, suppose it refers —

GENERAL McCREE :
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

Suppose it — as I read some of this,

some of this correspondence says, I did this, or I didn't
do that, in connection with a given private bill.
Would that be — was in this category?
GENERAL McCREE:

We believe that that is not barred

from evidence, because -QUESTION:

Even though it refers to something he

did or didn't do, that would be —
GENERAL McCREE:

Even though it refers to something

he did or didn't do -QUESTION:

Even though what he says he did or didn't

do would have been a legislative act.
GENERAL MCCREE:
done it.

Exactly.

But he may not have

If there's a letter saying, if you give me a certain

sum of money, I will cause a private bill to be introduced
for you, this is clearly not a legislative act.
QUESTION:

So you say — you say that under Brewster,

it would not require exclusion of a promise to introduce a
bill in return for money?
GENERAL McCREE:

As I read Brewster, Brewster does

not require its exclusion, because —
QUESTION:

Well, would it require then, Mr. Solicitor

44
General, the exclusion:

I introduced the private bill on

your behalf on such-and-such a date?
GENERAL McCREE:

Well, I assume that — let us assume

that that is a false statement, that he did not, in fact,
introduce a private bill.

But he said this for the

purpose of eliciting a payment.
QUESTION:

But suppose he did, though.

Suppose he

had introduced it?
GENERAL McCREE:

Well, if it were introduced for the

purpose of showing that he did, in fact, introduce the bill,
I would agree with the Court.
QUESTION:

Well, but we excluded that.

Suppose it was introduced to prove the case, that
he took money for a legislative act?
GENERAL McCREE:

Or for an official act?

We submit that it's admissible; that

the Court should find that it's admissible for that purpose,
because soliciting a bribe is clearly and concededly not an
legislative act.

And whatever inducement he may employ for the

purpose of soliciting a bribe cannot therefore be a legislative
act.
And that is not forbidden by the speech or debate
clause.
QUESTION:

But Mr. General, it isn't forbidden by

the district court order either.
it's talking about the future.

If it's the future — if

45

GENERAL McCREE:
way I read that.

If the Court please, that is the

And we would suggest that the past-future

dichotomy is not a valid one.
We submit that the court — the district court was
too restrictive, because under the old Hillman case, for
example, a statement of a present intention to do something
in the future can be the basis for a finding that it was in
fact done.
And so we think logically the Court should have -should not even have made the past-future dichotomy.

It should

have said that in both instances, the evidence would be
admissible.
QUESTION:

But as I understood your comment a moment

ago, you said a latter, assume bythe Congressman that he
wrote to someone, said, if you give me X dollars, I will
introduce such-and-such a bill.

And you said that would be

reference to a future act that may or may not ever be
performed.
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:
oe admissible.

Exactly.

And would therefore be admissible.

Should

And as I understand it, that's admissible

under the district court's order.
GENERAL McCREE:

It's also my understanding.

But the

district court said that reference to the past —
QUESTION:

Right.

Now the question is, could such

* letter be admissible if it said, "You will recall that two

46

months ago you gave me $500 and I introduced such-and-such
for that.35
Now would that letter be admissible?
GENERAL McCREE:

We submit that it would, because

that statement might be false.

And if he said that for the

purpose of eliciting a further payment, and he had not
in fact introduced the bill —QUESTION:

I see.

You do not offer it for the truth

of the matter asserted in the letter?
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

General McCree, I suggest to you that

my earlier colloquy with Mr. Stavis is not entirely irrelevant
to some of the questions that my brethren have been asking
you.
This is a very hypothetical situation we're presented
with.

And I take it you agree that the jurisdiction of this

Court exists by virtue of 28 U.S.C. 1254; that the case was
in the Court of Appeals, and wa therefore had jurisdiction to
review it.
GENERAL McCRES :

T4e do , and we concede , however,

that unless the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, that this
Court does not have jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

And the only way the Court of Appeals

had jurisdiction was pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3731.
GENERAL McCREE:

Exactly.

And we contend that this is

an order suppressing evidence under 3731, and as such, it's

47
appealable if the appeal were taken before the defendant was
placed in jeopardy.
And we submit that the provision itself admonishes
us to give it a liberal construction, to effectuate its
purposes; and that is, to allow the government to have a ruling
before a defendant is placed in jeopardy.
QUESTION:

Do you think the government could come in

and on its own, without the defendant making any motion, say
this is the evidence we’re going to present at trial, we'd
like the trial court to rule on whether it would be admissible
or not; then the trial court divides it into categories, and
says this willbe

admissible; this isn't; and the government

can then appeal, say the court’s determination that certain
evidence is hearsay, and would therefore be inadmissible?
GENERAL McCREE:

That's a difficult question, if the

Court please.
?

An order elimine
QUESTION:

which is really what it is —

Ye3.

GENERAL McCREE:

—■ indicating what evidence might

or might not be introduced is admissible under some systems
of procedure„
Now whether the Federal rules of Criminal Procedure
permit it, I can't direct the Court's attention to a specific
provision.

But in this case, the Court did, and the Court had

the matter properly before it on Mr. Helstoski's motion to
dismiss.

48

And "lr. Halstoski raised several questions about the
evidence.

And the court, in its ruling — in fact, in its

first ruling, its oral ruling, it said that we would have to
redact the indictment.
But in its subsequent written opinion, it indicated
that we didn't have to redact the indictment, but as the
Court has already pointed out, we could show evidence of
promises to perform future legislative acts, but not past ones.
And so we —- the court did, in fact, suppress evidence,
and we suggest, that although this Court hasn't decided the
question, there are a number of decisions in the Court of
Appeals which have done exactly this.
?
One case that I recall is Batisti v. United States,

in which the Sixth Circuit decided that, and another one in
the — this Court denied certiorari — that's United States
v. Craig from the Seventh Circuit ——
We suggest that the Speech or Debate Clause creates
immunity for a Congressman from civil or criminal liability
for his legislative acts.

And we concede that it shouldn't

be construed as narrowly as the speech or debate in the
Congress, but that it's the kind of acts that are generally
done in furtherance of a legislative process, which certainly
doesn't include soliciting a bribe.
And so we say that there is an immunity from
prosecution for a legislative act.

We further submit that

49

the Court has developed an evidentiary privilege in imple­
mentation of this immunity.
And as the Court has done twith the other privileges,
evidentiary privileges, that it has created, that —- we
suggest that the shield should not be any broader than is
necessary to protect the interests for which it was established.
QUESTION:

And all was waivable, I gather?

GENERAL MeCREE:
QUESTION:

All was waivable?

GENERAL MeCREE:
waivable.

I beg your pardon?

And we suggest, too, that it is

And in this respect, of course, there isn’t any

question but that Mr. Helstoski made a gesture before the grand
jury of a clean breast of everything:

I want the grand jury

to know that I have nothing to hide.
And he brought in all of these materials, although
he was told that he was not required to do this.

And to

permit him to do this, and then to assert a privilege, would
be to make a mockery out of the privilege, because he would
just have it one way; not both wayst
And the Court does not permit that in other matters,
and we see no reason why it should in this matter.
We'd also like to suggest that there’s another
reason why the district -- why this indictment is good, and
why the district court's restriction on evidence should be
reversed.

50

We advanced the theory in Brester that was suggested
in Johnson that if there were a narrowly — a statute narrowly
drawn to achieve the end of regulating the conduct of a
business, that the Congress could then involve the executive
branch and the judicial branch in its -- in the discipline of
its members.
And we suggest that in section 201, the Congress has
done exactly that, in its definition of who is an official
for the purpose of Section 201, it specifically provides that
a member of the Congress is; and then it specifically sets
for the offenses which the defined officials may not — of
which they may be found guilty»
So clearly this is a statute narrowly drawn to
achieve the end of regulating the conduct of its members.
And we suggest that there's a good reason for it, too.
And my brother who was arguing here a few moments
ago suggested — or stated, in response to a question from the
Court, that a jury wouldn't be available if a member of the
Congress was called on to trial.
The Congress has decided for this purpose, with the
third branch involveraent, there will be a jury; there can be
confrontation; right of counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, not only that there can; there must

GENERAL McCREE:

There must be — I thank the Court

QUESTION:

But we suggest that this

at the results that we request.

Mr. Solicitor General, may I be sure I

understand your argument?
You're suggesting in substance, as I understand it,
that Congress can waive the privilege in certain limited
areas? is that right?
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

We do.

Could they pass a statute that says,

members may be questioned about banking legislation? Or
members may be questioned about legislation dealing with any
other specific subject in which perhaps a minority of the
Congress might be vitally interested and the majority might
not be interested?
GENERAL McCREE:

I think these are clearly legislative

acts, and I would have difficulty with that.
QUESTION:

Well, if they can't waive them in that

situation, how they can waive it here?
GENERAL McCREE:

Well, what they are doing is

52

asserting that members may be tried for non--legislative
acts, which is what we have here.
QUESTION:

Well, but if you have a non-legislative

act, you don't need the waiver, as I understand it.
GENERAL McCREE:I Well, this is really in response to
the argument that the Congress has exclusive jurisdiction of
the disciplining of its members.

And we don't think we have

to belabor that, because we think if the Court is to agree
with his argument there, it would have to reverse Brewster.
QUESTION;

And Johnson.

Well, I thought your position was that

with a narrowly drawn statute Congress could authorize the
prosecution of Congressman for the performance of legislative
acts?
GENERAL McCREE:

No.

QUESTION:

If the Court please, I did not
If I did, I stand corrected.

Well then, what relevance is your argument

in this case, then, on this point?
GENERAL McCREE:

Well, this is just a second argument

why the Congress, with a narrowly drawn statute, could have
involved the executive branch and the judicial branch, in the
disciplining of its members.
In addition to the argument that prevailed in
Brewster, identifying the act as a non-legislative act, the
taking of a bribe —QUESTION:

So you're just saying the Congress — that

53

a narrowly drawn statute could authorize the executive to
punish Congressman for conduct falling outside the speech and
debate clause.
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

That's as far as you — that's as far

as the argument goes?
GENERAL McCREE:

That's as far as that argument

goes.
QUESTION:

And this argument — and it also — so

that first argument doesn't affect whether or not this
evidence is admissible?
GENERAL McCREE:

Only in this sense:

this is a non-legislative act, evidence
bribe,

of soliciting a

evidence can be introduced in support of it.
QUESTION:

That since

Yes.

As long as —■ if you're right on

If you're right on that.
But if the Court thought that this involved evidence

or conduct protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, your
argument then would fall by the wayside?
GENERAL McCREE:
argument.

We would have to go to our waiver

It would fall by the wayside.

And only a waiver

would permit a prosecution for that.
QUESTION:

And — so you at least say then that the

privilege or the immunity belongs to a member individually?
GENERAL McCREE:
we do.

On — with respect to the waiver,

Yes, but it's also —• it's something

GENERAL McCREE:

I just asked you if Congress could, by a

narrowly drawn statute, authorize the prosecution for a
legislative act; and you said no.
GENERAL McCREE:

Yes, that's correct.

not retreat from that position.
QUESTION:

And I will

And I'm suggesting —

So that the privilege does belong to the

individual?
GENERAL McCREE:

It belongs to the individual.

And

I suggest that to allow an individual to have it both ways
is contrary to our whole system of jurisprudence; that if he
doesn't claim, if he does express a waiver clearly — we think
he can be prosecuted.
QUESTION:

But even in this case I don't -- is there

some evidence that he consented to be prosecuted for a
legislative act?
GENERAL McCREE:

No, he did not expressly waive,

but we have —
QUESTION:

No, did he ever consent to be prosecuted

for a legislative act?
GENERAL McCREE:

He did not consent to be prosecuted

55
for a legislative act.
QUESTION:

Do we need to decide in this case whether

Congress could, by a very — statute more narrowly drawn
perhaps than Section 201, submit to trial for a legislative
acts?
Do we need to decide that?
GENERAL McCREE:

We need not? we need not.

Because

the act here, soliciting a bribe, is clearly and concededly not
a legislative act.
QUESTION:

So the case could be decided narrowly on

the basis of Brewster and Johnson?
GENERAL McCREE:

We believe that it can.

We believe

Court should reverse that decision of the Third Circuit.
QUESTION:
there?

Well, there's another alternative, isn't

And that is to let them go their way and see what

happens.
GENERAL McCREE:

That is another course that's

available to the Court too.
We think that the district judge could benefit from

56

the guidance of this Court in indicating what was referred to
in Brewster as acts relating to legislative acts, and not
legislative acts themselves.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather Mr. Solicitor General,

that the government thinks it has a case even without materials
that Judge Meaner's order would exclude?
GENERAL McCREE:
QUESTION:

We believe that —

A case enough to get to the jury.

GENERAL McCREE:

We believe the government has such

a case, and we filed with the court a sealed appendix that I
think contains sufficient evidence to go to the jury.

But

we would like to take the strongest case we dean.
My brother didn't speak about his mandamus action
in — or at least that aspect of it that was the basis for the
Court of Appeals denial of his petition.
And we think that the Court of Appeals was clearly
right there.

And unless the Court has any questions about that

I would not discuss that in argument.
If the Court please, then, that concludes the
argument of the government at this vantage.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

General.

MR. STAVIS:

Yes, I do.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON STAVIS , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 546 AND
RESPONDENT in 349
MR. STAVIS:

Thank you vary much.

Picking up the colloquy between Mr. Justice White
and the Solicitor General, it seems now to be conceded that
the Congress cannot waive into an Article III court trial of
a legislative act.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

If you understood it that way, I didn9t.
I think that was what the Solicitor

General —

I thought he said Congress has not done

that up to now.

I thought he went further.
I asked him that.

Whatever —

is another matter.
QUESTION:

Do we need to decide what Congress could

MR. STAVIS:

I understand that.

you don't have to decide this question.

I understand that
But. I thought I

heard the Solicitor General conceding that.
If I'm wrong, I respectfully request to be excused
for this error.

But if I am right, then what the Solicitor

General is saying is that while the whole body of Congress

58

can’t waive into an Article III court, one member can.
And it just seems to me^a^ that falls of its own
weight.
QUESTION:

There are many things that Congress could

not do to waive your rights or my rights which you or I
individually might well do.
MR. STAVIS:

But not when the rights relate to the

jurisdiction of a court.

I can’t waive myself into this
?

Court.

That’s one of the points that Mr. Justice Blackwood

suggested.

We can’t — by the fact that I may not have even

cross-petitioned.

I can’t waive the objection to the juris­

diction to the Third Circuit.
And if this is jurisdictional, then the waiver
argument doesn't apply either with respect to Congress as a
whole or acting as individuals.
Now, I would like if I may to —•
QUESTION:

Well, let’s test that, Mr. Stavis.

Supposing the Congressman is called before a grand jury.

He’s

alone in the grand jury room, and a bunch of questions are
asked of him, all of which pertain to legislative acts.
He could answer those, couldn’t he?
MR. STAVIS:

He not only could answer them, but if

he’s not the target, I believe he’s required to answer.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

Assume he's the target.
Well

59

QUESTION:
"2

He still could answer them, if he decides,

think I'll answer these questions."
MR. STAVIS:

If he is the target, and if he answers

them, he is probably subject to discipline by the House.
QUESTION:

For waiving his privilege, he’s subject

to discipline?
MR. STAVIS:

I respectfully suggest to you that if

you'll look at Jackson's manual, as recorded in our brief,
in which he says, "Yes, he may not waive that privilege of
the House of Speech and Debate."
But even if the House should overlook that, and he
has waived it, and he has testified — he has testified — the
next question is, what is the consequence of that testimony?
Does that waive him into an Article III court when the
constitution says the Article III court has no jurisdiction?
I've never been able to go to a courthouse and say,
please, take this case, even though you don't have jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t the grand jury in an Article

III court?
MR. STAVIS:

The grand jury is partially in an

Article III court? yes, sir.
500

something else, too.
QUESTION;

Partially.

This also adds in

I think it's in honor of the executive.
Well, Mr. Stavis, there's no evidence

here — there's no evidence there that even if the Congressman
appeared before the grand jury and freely talked about

60
legislative acts, made no objection whatsoever, if yhe didn’t
go on and said, I also waive my immunity from prosecution
for legislative acts, he wouldn’t have waived his immunity
from prosecution.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION;

Of course not.

He never even said --

There isn't any evidence like that here?

MR. STAVIS:

Not in the slightest.

Not in the

slightest.
May I have 30 seconds?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. STAVIS;

We’ll give you 60.

Thank you.

I want to focus on my case for just a moment:

and

that is, the indictment, and particularly on what may be
attractive to some members of the Court, which is, well, let's
just fix up this indictment.
I simply want to say that the consequence of that
is that you remove the effective operation of the speech and
debate clause at the point where it's most important; namely,
where it is accusatory.
Now in

Kilbourn against Thompson, the meaning of the

term "question” was not, Mr. Justice Stevens, in terms of
do you ask a question.

It is rather, may you make a charge.

I respectfully refer you to
09

opinion

, in which he

equates

Mr. Justice Millar’s

the Speech or Debate Clause rule

61

term "questions" to the language of the Massachusetts
constitution, which refers to accusation.
If you take that concept, and we move over to Justice
Rehnquist's question, and say, is there any case where you
set aside an indictment because of something that happened in
the grand jury?

And I say that that's exactly what you do in

the immunity type case, where a grand jury heard testimony
that was barred; they should have heard.

And you say to that

prosecutor, "Well, if you did it, we cancel that indictment.
If you want to go ahead and not use that prohibited testimony,
you’re free to do so."

And that's all we've ever said here.

And if the prosecutor should decide not to do that,
in any event we said that the Congress has jurisdiction.
I'm very grateful to you, Your Honor, for indulging
me to that extent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:24 o'clock, a.m., the case in the
above entitled matter was submitted.]
