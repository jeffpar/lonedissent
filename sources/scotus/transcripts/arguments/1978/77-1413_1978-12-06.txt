PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Aronson against Quick, Point Pencil
Company»
Mr» Cook; I think you may proceed whenever you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF C» LEE COOK, JR. , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR® COOKs

Mr» Chief Justice,, end may it please the

Court s
The petitioner in this case; Jane Aronson, in 1955
made an invention, that invention was the design of a particular
kind of key ring or keyholder.

Now, the particular design of

that keyholder is not really material to this case, but I
think I should note that it is differant from the design
shown in the English patent, which is attached to the brief
of the amicus Ercon, and it is different from the design
shown in the Leopoldi patent, which is a part of the record
in this case»
QUESTION*

Is there a picture of it, or a representa­

tion of it anywhere in the
MR. COOK s
record»

There is not as such in the printed

What is attached to the record which came to the Court *

we believe, is an actual sample of the key ring»
QUESTION*

How is that relevant to the contract

4
isstia?
MR® COOKs

It is net*, Your Honor®

Except -- the only

reason I mentioned the particular — that it is different from
the design shown in those patents
QUESTION?

I see®

MR® COOK s

— is the argument of the amicus Ercon,

that it was in the public domain, —
QUESTION s Right®
MR® COOKs

»“ or known before the invention by the

petitioner,,
The closest thing that describes it is a catalog
of the respondent Quick Point, which is in the printed record,
but you cannot see the inside of the key ring®
QUESTION s Right®
MR® COOK;

Having made this invention and having

prepared and filed a patent application which disclosed and
described the invention, she took it to a number of potential
manufacturers®

On© of those manufacturers was the respondent

Quick Point. Pencil Company in St® Louis®

The then president

of Quick Point was very interested in manufacturing this
article, and he proposed a license agreement, which called for
a five percent royalty on the sales of the article by Quick
Point®
At the request of petitioner, an addendum was
prepared to this license agreement®

That addendum provided

5
that if no patent were issued within five years, the royalty
rate would be reduced to two and a half percent»

But that

royalty would continue as long as Quick Point made the article»
Now, no patent was ever obtained, and at the end of
the five~year period the royalty was reduced to two and a half
percent»

Quick Point paid those royalties for many years

after it was known that no patent would obtain,, and after it
repeatedly reaffirmed its obligation to do so»
Now, although the article was secret at the time it
was first disclosed to Quick Point, and it was disclosed to
Quick Point and the others under an obligation of confidence,
the nature of the invention is such that once it was put on
commercial sale, it was revealed to the public and could be
copied by others»

And, indeed, by the late 1960's a number of

other companies were making devices substantially identical to
Quick Point»
Now, in 1975, Quick Point stopped paying royalties
and brought this suit for declaratory judgment»

It contended

in the suit that the agreement was iliegeil arid unenforeible»
It did not contend, as respondent's brief in this Court contends,
that the intention of the parties was that no royalties would
be due if no patent were obtained? on the contrary, it contended
the opposite»

That is, that the agreement bound Quick Point

to pay royalties even if no patent were obtained, and that
made the agreement illegal»

6

On a stipulated record and cross motions for summary
judgment , the district court found that the agreement was
clear and unambiguous? that it was valid and enforcible under
the State lav/? and that there was s>o reason in the federal
patent policy or the federal antitrust policy for the federal
courts to interfere with its enforcement»
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a fcwo-tO"one
decision, reversed»

It held that the principles involved

in the federal patent law precluded Quick Point from being
bound by its agreement because no patent was issued, and the
article had become publicly known and was no longer a secret»
District Judge Larson, sitting by designation, distsented, saying that in his view the matter should be controlled
by State contract law and that there was no reason for the
federal court to preempt and refuse to enforce the State Xaw0
Thtis, the question presented by this case is s
Does the federal patent law preempt the State law and prevent
enforcement: of a contract calling for continuing royalties
on a previously secret article simply because no patent was
issued and the article is no longer secret?
Now, we submit that the decision of the Court of
Appeals here constitutes an unnecessary interference by the
federal courts with the normal application of State contract
law»

That interference was not required by, nor even

consistent with, the federal patent law»

7
I intend to deal primarily with the error of the
Court of Appeals with respect to the federal patent law»
We believe also that there is nothing inconsistent about
enforcing this agreement with the federal antitrust laws or
the policy of free and open competition»

That subject matter

is* however* covered very thoroughly in the briefs, particu­
larly the brief of the United States amicus* and I believe
that Mr» Grossman* who will speak on behalf of the United
States* will also touch on that issue»
Specifically I want to deal with three points»
First* that this case is governed by the rule laid
down by this Court in Kewanee Oil vs» Bicron»
Secondly* that the Court of Appeals failed to apply
that test»
And thirdly* if that test is applied to the State
contract law involved in this case* it is clear that the
objectives of the federal patent law are not interfered with*
and that there is no conflict between the federal patent law
and the State contract law in this case»
QUESTION?

That's really just one point* isn't it?

That this case is governed by Kewanee»
MR» COOKs

Yes* it really is»

And I don’t think

there can be any doubt that it is governed by Kewanee0

The

Court will recall in that case that it sustained the validity
of State trade secret law, which permitted an owner of a trade

8

secret

to sue former employees for misappropriating those

trade secrets0
In that case the Court reaffirmed its prior holding
that the patent law is not exclusive and that the State lav/
should be enforced unless it conflicts with the patent law or
the federal law»

And the way to determine whether a State law

conflicts with a federal law, thei Court said, was to look at
whether it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the
objectives of the federal law»
Now, the objective of the federal patent law, as set
forth in the Constitution, is to promote the progress of
science and the useful art30
invention»

In other words, to encourage

The patent law encourages invention in two wayss

first, it offers the inventor a patent which, for a limited
period of time, permits that inventor to exclude others from
making, using or selling his invention; secondly, in return
for that extraordinary grant, it requires the inventor to dis­
close fully his invention to the public in the patent»

In

that way, not only is the public free to use it after the
expiration of the.patent, but it becomes a part of the body of
knowledge, and that itself should contribute to and stimulate
further inventions or other advances in the art»
QUESTION %

In your view, Hr» Cook, would the case be

any different if no patent had been applied for, but the idea
had merely been presented to the respondent company, and then

9

they made the agreement for either a two and a half percent
straight or whatever?
MR» COOKg

In my view* Mr, Chief Justice? the case

would be no different.

Because in this case the petitioner

took nothing from the public? she never got a patent* and
whether it was revealed in a patcsnt or
application is really irrelevant,

contained in a patent

The point is she revealed

an idea* she mads a contract* and there is no reason for this
respondent to get out

of its obligation to pay the royalties

under that contract.
The test* therefore* under Kewanee is whether
enforcing this agreement will discourage invention or prevent
the disclosure of inventions to the public.
Appeals nowhere applied this test.

The Court of

It did not even consider

it* as far as we can tell from the opinion? there is no
discussion of the analysis or the test in Kewanee at all.
Although it made reference to Kewanee* it did not discuss its
test.
When that test is applied here? however* it is clear
that enforcing this agreement will not create^ an obstacle to
the accomplishment of the objectives of the patent law* but
will instead further those objectives.

It will certainly not

discourage invention? on the other hand* it

will encourage

invention to enforce agreements such as this.
Because inventors* if they know that they can enter

,

10

into agreements such as this, will be willing to expend the
time, effort and money without concern as to whether their
invention is patentable or not, or without concern as to
whether their invention is one which can be kept secreto
And, as this Court noted in Kewanee, often an
important invention may not be patentable, but it is, nevertheless, an important invention0
Under the law prior to the decision in the Court of
Appeals, if the inventor made a valuable invention and the
manufacturer was willing to pay for it, the inventor could
have the expectation of entering into an enforcible agreement
which would provide him a reward for his invention, and he
would therefor® be encouraged to invento
Failure to enforce this agreement, on the other hand,
will discourage invention, because the inventor who cannot
obtain a patent will be faced with two alternatives!

he can

go into the manufacture of the article himself =■« which this
Court noted in Kewanee may not be the best allocation of our
economic resources — or he can attempt to sell it for a single
lum]“sum payment before it becomes secret, get all c£ his
money immediatelyc

But that’s often difficult, too, because

licensees are reluctant to make substantial payments until
they know what the commercial success of the invention will
he*
Not only will enforcement of this agreement encourage

11
invention, it will cause those inventions to be made available
and known to the public sooner, rather than later»

Rather

than waiting to see if he can obtain a patent, under ■
agreements of this type, the inventor puts his article or his
invention out to the public immediately? not only into the
commercial channels where it may benefit the economy, but
also to the public so that they can copy it, or be stimulated
to make further and additional inventions»
QUESTION s But on some inventions the copying of it
is not easy, because the content is not discernible»

Is it

not true that some companies, even having a patentable itera,
do not patent it but simply seek to preempt the market —
MR» COOK?
QUESTION?

That is true, Your Honor»
*— without any patent, so that they don’t

have to disclose?
MR» COOK?

And that is really the truly anomalous

thing about the Court of Appeals decision and the position
of the respondent in this case, because .if this invention had
been one which could be kept secret and was not revealed
upon its sale to the public, the Court of Appeals and the
respondent would say the agreement is enforcible»
And yet the objectives of the patent law are
furthered much better by an agreement where the invention
becomes public and available to the public than they are in
a situation where the invention by its nature remains secret»

12

Yet this Court, in Kewaneespecifically approved
not only enforcing implied agreements against employees but
contracts for inventions where the subject matter of the
invention remains secreta
Now, really, nowhere in respondent’s brief does
respondent ever contend that enforcement of this agreement will
discourage invention or discourage the disclosure of invention.
And that’s because it is impossible to make that contention
on these facts»
Under Kewanee , if the enforcement of a State law
will not interfere with the accomplishment of the patent law
objectives of encouraging invention and encouraging disclosure
to idle public of invention —* which is the case here — there
is no need, there is no reason for the federal courts to
interfere with the normal application of State law»
Now, instead of dealing with this point, the
respondent argues that the difficulty here is that enforcing
agrsr aments of this type will cause inventors who apply for a
patent to be *—» to abandon those patent applications»

The

argument goes that an inventor will apply for a patent, get
an agreement such as this, and then abandon the application»
That argument, we believe, is unsound for several
reasons»
First, it is factually unsound»

As this Court noted

in Kewanee, the benefits of a patent are such that it is

13
very unlikely that anyone who really has a patentable invention,
will abandon that patent application»
Secondly, it is particularly true where, as in this
case, the commercial use of the invention discloses it to the
public»

We're not talking about the famous Coca-Cola formula,

which Mr» Justice Marshall referred to in his concurring
opinion in Kewanee, we're talking about tin invention that,
when it is sold, it is publicly known»

Under those circum-

stances, the chances that a patent applicant will in bad faithin order to take advantage of his licensee, somehow abandon a
patent application on a valid patentable invention, are
remote indeed»
Moreover, this problem, if indeed it is a problem,
is one which easily can be solved by draftsmanship»

The

contract can say the patentee or the licensor will diligently
pursue the application? and then if ha doesn't do so he has
b re a died the agreement»
Or it can say that the licensee may have the right
to prosecute the patent application, a provision that is quite
common and frequent in patent license agreements»
Or it can provide that, if no patent is obtained,
the royalties will cease, or they will cease after a given
number of years, or they will cease after the production of a
given number of units, or the payment of a given amount of
royalties»

All of those are ways of overcoming this problem.

14
if indeed it is a problem»
But let's assume for the moment,,

for purposes of

argument* that there would bo some incentive by a patent
applicant who has a license agreement such as this to abandon
the application»

That does not mean that enforcing this agree­

ment will stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the
patent law»

As this Court pointed out in Kewanee* some
I

diversion from the patent system is permissible»

And the

diversion from the patent system or the potential diversion
from the patent system in Kewanee is much greater than the
potential diversion her©»
Because in Kewanee it contemplated an invention which
remained secret»

There at least the owner of the invention has

an option* he can say* BI will get the patent? but if I get
that* it becomes public* or I can keep it secret and try to
protect my rights by keeping it secret,”

Here the inventor

has no such choice* because once he puts his article on sale*
it becomes public and he cannot keep it secret»
The diversion from the patent system,if indeed there
is any* is much less in this case than in the facts presented
in Kewanee»
As 1 mentioned before* in answer to Mr» Chief
Justice's

question* the fact is that both the Court of Appeals

and respondent here would have enforced this agreement if the
subject matter of the agreement had not been the article which

15
became public upon its sale, but, for example, the process by
which it is made0

Even though a patent application had been

applied for and abandoned, under the rationale of the decision
below that agreement would be enforcible»

Yet, merely

because the invention here was one which became public upon
its sale, the Court of Appeals says it is not enforcible»
Yet I submit to you that the circumstances here are
lass inconsistent and indeed more — they are in fact
consistent with the objectives of the patent law, much more
so than in the case

where the invention can be kept secreto

Finally, this argument of respondent’s, we believe,
deals not with the objectives of the patent law but with the
means by which

the patent law chooses to accomplish those

objectives»
The important tiling here is not whether somebody
gets a patent, the important thing is that they make inventions;
and that they disclose those inventions to the public»
\

The fact that the State law will csncourage invention
and encourage disclosure does not make it inconsistent with
the federal patent law? indeed, as this Court noted in
Kewanee, certainly the patent policy of encouraging invention
is not disturbed by the existence of another form of incentive
to invente

The

State contract law involved in this case

and the federal patent law are not in conflict, they are in
harmonye

Both can stand together, one complementing the other,

16

to encourage research and innovation, which is vital to our
economy and to the continued growth of our nation0

Probably

more so today than at any time in our history®
The decision of the Court of Appeals thwarts that
encouragement e£ invention and unnecessarily strikes down State
law®

It should be reversed,,
Your Honor, X8d like to reserva the rest of my time

for rebuttalo
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Ver/ well, Mr. Cook„

Mr, Grossman®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF B® BERRY GROSSMAN, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR® GROSSMANs

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court*
The issue before you today is whether State laws
which enforce contracts of the type here at issue would so
significantly impede federal patent or competition policy as
to require preemption®
Preemption issues of this type have been resolved
by the Court by defining the specific federal patent and
competition policies articulated by Congress, and carefully
analyzing the impact on such policies that would result from
enforcement under State law of various types of contract

or

procedural rights®
Applying such an analysis to this case, the United

17
States has concluded that enforcement of the contract such as
that entered into between Mrs» Aronson and Quick Point would
not adversely impact any federal policy,,
On the contrary» we believe that the availability
of such contractual means of rewarding inventors will foster
the achievement of innovation» rapid disclosure of new ideas»
and new entry into commercial markets? goals at the very heart
of federal patent and competition policies„
Since petitioner’s counsel has devoted most of its
remarks to patent policies» I should like to start my remarks
with a discussion of the impact of this contract on federal
competition policies»
Contracts of the type which concern us today pose
no danger to federal competition policies that cannot be
checked by the normal application of the antitrust laws0
Statements by respondent to the effect that enforcement of the
contract will promote monopoly in contrast to free competition
portray a misunderstanding of both of those concepts®
QUESTIONS

Mr# GroPssman» are you suggesting that

there are contracts which would be enforcible under State law
which do not violate the antitrust laws» but which would»
nevertheless» be preempted by what you’ve referred to as
federal competition policy?
MR® GROSSMAN %
Your Honor®

No» I do not make that suggestion»

It is conceivable that contracts enforcible under

13
State law could violate federal antitrust policy? for example,
a requirements contract which, under the antitrust standard,
would foreclose an unreasonable portion of the market, they
could be enforcible under State law but violative of the anti­
trust laws.
One could have a contract that would not ba violative
of antitrust laws but would nevertheless frustrate federal
patent policies.

But I am not suggesting that there is some

level of impact on competition beneath the dignity, as it were,,
of an

antitrust violation that would nevertheless require

preemption, unless it frustrated some other federal policy,
QUESTION?

Well, what —- other federal policies,

such as?
MR® GROSSMAN:

I#m not — the patent policy in this

case®
QUESTION?

Which would ba the laws enacted by

Congress?
MR® GROSSMAN g

In terms of

* th© patent policy

and the antitrust policy are complementary here,

It is

conceivable, of course, that one could have a situation in
which federal patent policy would be frustrated even though
antitrust policy might not be®
QUESTION?

And one looks to find federal patent

policy, I taka it, in the lav/s enacted by Congress pursuant
to the patents, the authority in —

19

MR» GROSSMANs

That is right» Basically the

primary goals of patent policy, as articulated by this Court,
have been the promotion of innovation, the facilitation of
rapid disclosure of new ideas, and the preservation of ideas
in the public domain, and protection of those ideas from
monopoly control»
QUESTIONg

And I presume the source of this Court’s

knowledge on that subject must be the Acts of Congress?
MR» GROSSMANs
QUESTIONS

I can think of no other source»

Neither can I„

MR» GROSSMAN s

It is not clear to me what monopoly

could be referred to here»

Certainly the enforcement of

the

contract here at issue does not confer any monopoly, in the
sense of a right to exclusive use, as that term is used in
the patent law»
QUESTIONS

Well, isn’t the contrary precisely what

the opposing party is relying on?
MR»GROSSMAN:

The fact that they are being faced

with what they believe to be unfair competition is precisely
the opposite of the —»
QUESTIONS

Because there is no monopoly» Because

she had no monopoly to sell®
MR® GROSSMANj

That’s right, Your Honor»

Nor does this case involve monopoly power, in the
sense that it is used under the antitrust lawsj namely, the

20

power to control prise or forestall entry <,

The degree of

market power conferred on a licensee of a commercially valuable
idea will depend on a number of factors, including the degree
to which the product is differentiated from different but
competing products, the degree to which the idea can be
easily ascertained and used by competitors, and the extent to
which competitors have offsetting advantages relative to the
licenseee
Now, we don’t suggest that indeterminative licenses
of commercially useful ideas could never contravene federal
antitrust policy„ What we do suggest is that the likelihood
is not so great as to warrant what is the equivalent to an
antitrust rule of per se illegality implemented in the form
of patent preemption of State contract law„
Our policy of free competition does not mandate
competition free of any and all contractual restraints? only
those restraints which are deemed unreasonable are prohibited,*
Economic analysis does not indicate that licenses
of the type here at issue inherently restrain competition,*
More-over, we lack experience or evidence which would indicate
that; such contracts will unreasonably restrain trade in such

a wide variety of cases as to justify a per se rule0
As this Court notad last term in Exxon v„ State of
Marylandt the fact that on® could reasonably hypothesise
situations in which competition might be impeded does not

21

justify preemption.

The existence of the antitrust laws

should provide sufficient protection against any significant
competitive restraints arising from contracts of this type.
Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals decision could
produce results iniiplcable to the goals of antitrust policies?
to the extent that it decreases the available Incentives for
innovative effort, it adversely impacts on the dynamic core
of our free enterprise system.

To the extent that it increases

risks, to both inventors and licensees, it is likely to
channel inventions to the larger firms who are better able to
spread and absorb those risks.
Such a trend, of course, would foster greater
industrial concentration contrary to national competition
policies,
I’d like to address this one point on the competi­
tion ”><=» on the patent policy and its relation to contracts
of this type,
I believe the critical core of respondent's argument
is stated on page 28 of its brief, where it states that the
risk is that inventors, such as Aronson, who believe their
inventions to be patentable, will have every incentive to
license their inventions during the period that the application
is pending, and then abandon their application in order to
obtain royalties for a period longer than allowed by the
patent laws

22
We suggest that this argument is inconsistent with
this Court's decision in Kewanes, unsound as a matter of
economic analysis, and unsupported'by empirical evidence®
It appears unsound as a matter of economic analysis,
not only as to the specifics of this case but in the general
run of cases as well®
Here Mrs» Aronson's failure to obtain the patent
hardly redounded to her economic benefit®

There are three

components which determine how much money an inventor, such
as Mrs® Aronson, would make in a situation like this®

One

is the royalty rate which she will receive? a second is the
unit?, price of the goods sold? end the third is the number of
units sold®
Reduction of any one of these three numbers or
components will reduce her total compensation®
Here we know from the record that the failure to
obtain a patent reduced two of those components®

An economic

theory would indicate that the third was also reduced®
Here her royalty rate was cut in half®

And also the

total sales on which that royalty rate was based would be
decreased®

Instead of obtaining a percentage on all sales

embodying her idea, as would have been the case if a patent
had issued, she only received moneys on those sales made by
Quick Point, whose share of the overfall market declined as
new entrants began making keyholders reflecting her ideas®

23

Additionally, economic theory teaches that a
monopolist is capable of charging a higher price for his goods
than could be obtained for them in a competitive market»
Thus*, to the extent that disclosure of her trade secret opened
the market to competition, the selling price of Quick Point's
key chains on which the inventor's royalty was based may have
been reduced»
The same economic analysis would lead one to believe
that most inventors are likely to prefer the l?»ysar monopoly
returns afforded by a patent system to the less certain
rewards that could be obtained under contract law, even if
those rewards might be spread out beyond the termination of a
patent»
This certainly was the conclusion of this Court in
Kewanee, and we are unaware of any empirical information or
body of academic literature developed since Kewanee which
challenges the reasonableness or correctness of that conclusion»
QUESTION:

How about the Brulotte case, does that

bear on this?
MR» GROSSMAN;

I suggest not, Your Honor»

The

Brulotte case turned upon the concept that the 17-year period
is the absolute limit which Congress grants in exchange for
the monopoly power which it has grunted»

Brulotte strikes me

to be based upon the same reasoning as displayed in earlier
cases by this Court, Kellogg

National Ms.cult Company and

24
Scott v0 Marcalus„ which state that upon the quid pro quo
received by the public in

return for tha grant of a monopoly

is that at the end of that 17-year period everybody will be
free to use the discoveryt free of any restrictions to the
inventor,
Here, of course,, there was no patent monopoly
granted,, and thus the basic rationale of Brulotte does not
apply 0
QUESTION s

Sine® everybody could use it from the

word Bgo”c
MR, GROSSMAN:
QUESTION:
I’ve forgotten.

That's correct,

What was the item involved in Brulotte?

Was it something that was necessarily dis­

closed to the public?
MR, GROSSMAN:

That was not clear from the record.

It was a hop-picking machine,, but there’s nothing in the
Court's decision,, at least; which would reveal whether
which would reveal to me whether it would have been disclosed
to tha public upon sale,
QUESTION:

Yea, Broadly read, the Brulotte case,

I should suppose^ does bear on this„ doesn’t it?

When it

says that even though it has bean disclosed to the public?
both because it was patented and presumably because it was
sold publicly,, you can't receive any license payments for an
unpatented article,

MR® GROSSMAN*

I believe it would be more accurate

to say that not only does Kewanee support it, and not only
does the reasoning of Kewanee support it, but the very basic
preemption theory which this Court uses support it? namely,
that absent a frustration of federal policy there is no reason

26
fco preempt State law®

The other cases in this general field*

Sears * Compco* ®t cetera* found that enforcement of the
particular State policies or rules at issue there %/ould result
in the frustration of federal purpose prohibited by the
Constitution

So your answer is yes?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN Nc GRISWOLD* ESQ® *
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR® GRISWOLDs

May it please the Courts

At pages 20 and 21 of the record appears the joint
stipulation in this case to which were attached a number of
these devices as exhibits* and I have asked the Clark to make
them available to the Court®

I would point out that Exhibits

W* X* Y and Z are keyholders made by the respondent* the
other exhibits are keyholders made by competitors®

It doesn’t

make any difference which ones are used* but I identify them
that way®
And* to anticipate a question* I think that seeing
the keyholders is relevant®
QUESTION*

I had assumed* Mr® Griswold* that the

case proceeded on the assumption that all the others were the

27
earn© or could be the same because there was no monopoly here»
MRo GRISWOLD?

Yes* indeed, Mr* Chief Justice»

That8s why I say it doesn’t make any difference which of
the — I would ask the Clerk to make them available to the
Court, if the Court is willing»

It is relevant, because it

is apparent, when you see it, that there is no secret here»
I have one of them here, and that's it, and you
put your keys on and then you, with a little force, press it
back»

tod once it has been mads and distributed, it is

completely apparent to anyone, not merely a skilled mechanic
but to anyone, what the idea is»
QUESTION?

Well, do you suggest that, by way of

argument, that it was never patentable in the first place?
MR» GRISWOLD?

No, Mr» Chief Justice, that I don’t

know» Two similar devices were patented»
I suggest that first on the ground that it shows that
the Kewanee decision is not applicable to this case»

This

case does not involve a trade secret, as that terra was used in
Kewanee»
I think it is also relevant, because there are
arguments her®, that these indefinite royalties are justified
because of the head start that Quick Point got when the
secret was dislosed to it, and that head start was worth a
great deal, which could be compensated for by royalties
indefinitely in the future»

28

And I think the exhibits themselves show that the
head start here, though probably something, was not much,
Neither in terms of capital cost nor in terms of time.
Now, at the outset, I think it is very important to
recall that this case involves a relatively narrow issue.
There are amicus briefs which discuss extensively problems of
technology and knowhow licensing and billions of dollars which
is affected.
But this case does not involve any aspect of
technology or knowhow licensing,

Any decision on that question

should of course await a record and briefs which deal with it.
And some of the briefs, and the government0s brief
in particular, talk extensively of trade secrets.

Indeed,

the government's brief uses the phrase Ktrade secrets" more
than forty times.
But this is not a trade secret case in the sense in
which that term was customarily used, and as it was involved
before the Court in the Kewane© case.

Indeed, in the Court's

opinion in the Kewanee case, the Court said, on page 484s
"By definition, a trade secret has not been placed in the
public domain,"
public domain.

But this keyholdar has been placed in the
It has been public since 1956, 22 years ago.

It's there for everyone to see and to copy.

formula or process in continuous use, no device which is used

Here the item

soon as the keyholdsr was put on the

market, as the contract contemplated it would be»
The distinction seems to be, to soma, to be more
subtle than I should think it would be»

I think I can

illustrate it by the fact that I was cotinsel for the petitiones
in the Kewanee case, and one of tha first things I did was to
come to the Court and meet with tha Clark and make arrangements
for the impoundment of tha record so that the secrets which
v
were included in it would not be disclosed»
There has bean no necessity for impounding the
record in this case»
There is no secret here, no need for reverse
engineering which is talked about in the patent cases»

Since

1956, th© secret has been in tha public domain»
\

QUESTION:

Wall, Mr» Griswold, does the authority

of the Stata to enforce its own contract, laws depend on the
presence or absence of a trade secret?
MR» GRISWOLDs

No, Mr» Justice, but it does depend

on the presence or absence of relation to the patent laws ~
and I-will turn to that right now»
Tha most important element in this case is that it
is a case involving a patent application, and I think that
that has already been pointed out, but I would like to turn
to page 23 of the record, which is the initial letter which,

30

with the itera on page 25, embodies the contract»
paragraph of the letter of June 26, 1956 s

The second

'“Quick Point Pencil

Company will have the exclusive right to make and sell keyholders of the type shown in your application, Serial No»
542677, and will start manufacturing within 60 days”»
And then at the end of the following paragraph
there is a further reference to"the design shown in your
application, Serial No» 542677»89
And then turn to page 24, the second full paragraph,
"In the event of any infringement3', and there could not be
an infringement unless there was a patento
But this was not something used by the president of
the respondent company alone, for Mrs» Aronson came back
with an amendment to the contract which was accepted, and
that appears on page 25, and that starts out, 0!In the event
that the Keyholder Patent Application number 542677 is not
allowed within five years, Quick Point Pencil Company agrees
to pay Jane Leopold!M «— as she than was -«* "two and one-half

to sell earns/
QUESTIONS

Mr» Griswold, I wonder, would it be

irrational in your view to treat this transaction between the
two parties as being made up of two contracts?

One contract

to pay five percent if the pa-tent issued, and another contract
to pay two and a half percent if they didn't get a patent

31
within five years0
MR® GRIBWOLDs
Justice,

Well, I don't think so, Mr® Chief

It was obviously negotiated at the same time as

part of one deal®

And 1 point out

QUESTIONS

Well, they are on different days,

literally, are they not?
MR® GRIBWOLDs
QUESTION?

One day apart®

Yes®

MR® GRISWOLDs

And finally accepted «- finally

accepted on June 27th by both parties®

It seams to me that

it is one contract, and it is not, as the government says
several times in its brief, a contract to pay five percent if
a patent is granted and two and a half percent if a patent
is not granted®

It is a contract to pay five percent, but if

a patent is not granted within fiva years, than to pay two and
a half percent®

That is the event which actually happened®

The patent application was abandoned some six years
after the contract was made, but the royalties have been paid
at the rate of two and a half parcant, after five years, until
1975 when this suit for a declaratory judgment was filed®
QUESTION % But the terms of the contract did require
payment of two and a half percent of the royalties, regardless
of whether or not a patent was issued®
MR® GRISWOLDs

Yes, it did, and that is nothing

which was introduced — that was also the same in the original

32

letter of June 26tht "on all keyholders which we make in
accordance with the design shown in your application"t no
limit of time was specified there*,

And the question in this

case is simply whether that provision can stand in the light
of the patent laws„
I’m glad that at the close of the argument one of
the relevant cases9 Brulotte v» Thys, was mentionedo

Thera

are several cases which are relevant by way of background here*
Sears and Compcqe to begin with, which hold in rather sweeping
terras that there cannot be any exclusive right with respect
to an unpatanted. article,,

Brulotte Vo_ Thys, which holds

that even if it is patented a contract otherwise perfectly
valid under State law to continue to pay royalties is invalidt
because of conflict with the patent lawn, if it calls for
royalty payments after the patent period has expired*,
And then I would refer particularly to Lear Vo
Adkins e which in many ways is quite close to this case»

It

involved a patent license granted during the application periodo
The decision of the Court was that thereafter a patent was
granted and the licensee decided that the patent was invalid
and gave notice that it would not pay the royalties covered
by the contract, and counterclaimed in a suit brought to
recover the royalties that the patent was invalido
And the basic decision in that case was that the
licensee could attack the validity of the patent

33

But the Court also held that he need not pay
royalties from the time whan he claimed that the patent was
invalid®
That, of course, was in the teeth of the provision
of the contract® And our position here is that the petitioner
here should not be in a better position than she would be if
she had gotten a patent, in which case her right to royalties
would have terminated after 17 years? or in batter position
than if she had gotten a patent and had attacked its validity,
in which case her obligation to pay royalties would cease, if
she got a decision that it was invalid®
QUESTION* Do we really know whether she is in a
better position?

What about the exclusive right to get

royalties from licensees, from the whole) market?

Obviously a

great many people copied this idea, and, had it been patent»
I

able,

all of these others, or many of them might have had to

pay royalties, a license fee?
MR® GRISWOLDs
QUESTION 8

I don’t think —

And it would have maintained ~ her

payments would have remained at five percent throughout the
17 years®
MR® GRISWOLDs

If she had gotten the patent within

five years? but she did not® And under the contract, she was
entitled to only two and a half percent, even if she got the
patent

34
QUESTIONS

But0 by the same token, doesn’t this,

what we’re just discussing, indicate that the parties
contracted with a view to the possibility, if not the likeli­
hood, that there would be no patent obtained?
MR» GRISWOLDS
means clear=

I don’t think that that is by any

This is not in the contracto

QUESTION?

Well, what was the reduction to two and

a half percent for?
MRo GRISWOLDs

It was not "if you don’t get a

patent", it was R!f you don’t get a patent within five years”0
And this might have continued ~ for a patent application,
she might have taken it to the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals or to the U0 Sa District Court, it might have been an
appeal that could have gone on for a long time? and the
contract was not ’’if you don’t get a patent", but "if you
don’t get it within five years"»
But I don’t think that’s really relevant for the
reason I’m about to state»

Because another distinction which

must be made here is that this is not a simpla contract case
entirely in the realm of State lev/, a likely agreement in the
Warner-Lambert case, where no patent or patent application was
involved»
QUESTIONs

That’s what I was going to ask you,

Mr» Griswold, in order to be sure that I understand the scope
and entire thrust of your argument»

What if in this case

35

there had been no reference whatsoever to any patent applica­
tion nor to whether or not a patent would be ever issued, but
simply the facts showed a disclosure by Mrs®, at present Mrs®
Aronson to Quick Point of this key ring, and a simple agreement
that "we’ll pay you two and a half percent of the sales price
for this key ring for every key ring we sell from now on",
with no reference to any patent law, and that this had been
written down in a contract that was valid under State law?
MRo GRISWOLDs

I know of any reason why that would

not be valid® That is the Warner-Lambert: case.
has never spoken to an endless contracto

This Court

There are some

emanations in the common law to the effect that such things
must be limited to a reasonable timec
QUESTION: Well, it’s endless only in so far as —
it's not in perpetuity, it's every time they sell one of these
key rings they pay Mrs® Aronson two and a half percent of
the sales price®
MR® GRISWOLD:
Thysa

Well, that was true in Brulotte v0

If they stopped picking hops, they wouldn't have to

pay royalties®
QUESTION:

I know, but that's — but my question ~

you think that sort of a contract would not at all be pre­
empted by the federal patent law?
MR® GRISWOLD:

That has the -« the key element in

this case is that there was a patent application®

36

QUESTION5

And that's critical,in your submission»

MR» GRISWOLDs

That's the central fact of this case,

Th© contract was made specifically with respect to it, it
provided for an exclusive license which could apply to the
secret, but obviously applied to the patentf and the petitioner
had no power to grant an exclusive license unless she got a
patent»

Anybody else could make it»

Her license couldn't be

exclusiveo
QUESTIONS

Well, it's according to how you define

the word "exclusive”»

One could easily read that as meaning,

"I won't license anybody else"»
MRo GRISWOLDs

Yes»

But the —- that it was a patent

application license is of basic significance because this
contract was not made under State law alone, it exercised a
power specifically given to the petitioner by the patent

1
laws»

And I call attention to Title 35 of the United States

Cod€i, Section 261, to which not sufficient weight, I believe,
is given in our brief»

As I prepared for the argument, I

wished we had had a point snore specifically on this»

But

that section provides that "Applications for patents, or any
interest therein, shall be assignable in law by an instrument
in writing»"

And that's what we have here»

"The applicant,

patentee, or his assigns or legal representatives may in like
manner grant and convey an exclusive right under his applica­
tion for patent, or patents, to the whole or any specified

37
part of the United States„M
And here the patent applicant was exercising that
power granted to her under the patent laws 0

She was proceeding

under the patent laws»
Mow, there are many other provisions to which I
could make reference,,

I find, for example, that the word

"applicant" or "application” appears at least 240 times in
the basic provisions of the patent lawG
QUESTION %

Mr® Griswold, could I ask one question

about your basic theory of the case?

Your opponents say that

your argument rests entirely, in so far as you claim a
conflict with the patent laws, entirely on the fact that
enforcement of this agreement will provide a motivation to a
patent applicant to abandon the patent application0

That the

policy involved here is one that is causing people to abandon
patent applications„

And that you do not rely on the inter­

ference with the policy to motivate discs.Losura of inventions
or to encourage invention itself, but just rely on that first
point about abandoning patent applications0
Is that a fair characterization of the central
thrust of your argument?
t

MR® GRISWOLD?
QUESTION?

No, Mr» Justice* -»

Well, what is the central thrust of your

argument, then?
MR» GRISWOLD?

Thcj central point here is that the

38

petitioner operated under the patent law»

She got definite

advantages from the patent law, in that she got leverage
in making her contracto

No one would have made this contract

for these royalties on a simple disclosure which could
immediately be made by anybody else0

That's one reason I

wanted the exhibits distributed, to show how simpla it was and
how easy it would be for anyone else to make ifc0
The reason she got substantial royalties, which have
aggregated, up till 1975, more than $200,000 —
QUESTION?

Granting all this, what federal policy

will be frustrated by enforcing this contract?

MRo GRISWOLDs
QUESTION?

I just want to know what it is0

The disclosure is colorlesso

Not disclosure0

Is it invention?

The policy favoring invention»
MR» GRISWOLDs

It is the capitalizing on the use of

the patent law, thereby obtaining leverage which produces a
larger royalty than would otherwise be used, available? and
which, in this case, provided for a royalty which I will call
indefinite, because it has no limited time, -QUESTION;

Mre Griswold, I respectfully suggest

you are not identifying a federal policy that would be
frustrated by enforcement of this contracto

39
MR® GRISWOLDS

The federal policy is using the

patent laws to obtain a monopoly position„

That is, to have

the leverage to obtain larger royalties than would otherwise
be available*, royalties which must eventually be paid by the
public in the charges for the article* and which continue
indefinitely under this contract.*, despite the fact that if she
had obtained the patent they would have been limited to 17
yearsa
QUESTIONS

Suppose, Mr® Griswold* that when she

came to tills company no patent application was pending and
they made exactly the same contract that was made* but that
she never applied for a patent, and assume no obligation to
apply was in the contract? how would that be any different?
MRo GRISWOLDs
QUESTION?

Well,

I

suggest, Mr» Chief Justice* —

How would she then be exploiting or

making any use of the patent law?
MR* GRISWOLD?

I suggest, Mr® Chief Justice, you

said "’and she made exactly the same contract” -QUESTION?

Yes®

MR® GRISWOLD?

she would never have made the same

contract, without having produced a patent application®
Nobody would agree to pay substantial royalties for this idea
open to the public, in the public domain, simply for its
disclosure® The only thing that you would have to go by then
would be head start value® And again this is one reason why I

40

asked that the item be distributed, because here it is plain
that the head start value is very little» There's no great
capital investment»

Almost any mechanic could put the

machinery together to make this item»
QUESTION z

But your client in the contract took the

risk of nonpatentability, didn't it?
MR» GRISWOLDs

Well*, I think that’s the issue in

the case , to soma extent, end
QUESTION %

Perhaps federal law, as you say, precludes;

the enforcement of such a contract, but certainly 'the contract
by its terms would seem to indicate that»
MR» GRISWOLDs

Well, the contract by its terms does

not deal with the question of its proper construction in the
event that no patent has ever obtained,

I tried to deal with

that in the last point of my brief, where I refer to the fact
that the contract is with respect to a patent application, and
v.

it calls for the exclusive license to make and sell»

And when

the exclusive license collapsed, because there was no power,
the petitioner did not deliver her part of the contract, when
she didn't get any power to deliver an exclusive license,
I suggest that there was a failure of consideration, and that
the contract should be construed to mean that royalties would
not be payable for more than a reasonable time»
I don’t think it is entirely clear 'that this contract
made between laymen should be construed as a matter of contract

41

law requiring indefinite payment,? a continuing payment of
royalties over an indefinite periodo
Now, it's true that the patent application gave no
rights to the applicanto
patent application,?

There can be no infringement of a

Nevertheless, a patent application has a

substantial in tergorent effecto

When a competitor sees

Mpatent pending" on an item, he is disinclined to make the
item, despite the fact that he knows that it is not protected
until the patent is obtained,,

He doesn’t want to incur the

capital costs, starting production of the item, setting up
his sales course, printing catalogs and so on, when he know»s
that, he may soon be foreclosed by the granting of the patent0
And the licensing of an application and the use of
the "patent pending" designation are a part of the benefits
expressly recognised by the patent law,

I have already

referred to Section 261, but Section 292 is the provision
which makes it a crime to use "patent pending" on an article
unless indeed you are the applicant or the licensee of the
patent application, in which case you can use it0

And that

undoubtedly provides important leverage in determining in the
bargaining process, which determines the amount of 'the
royalties under the contract0
The heart of the case, I suggest, is found in the
fact that there was a patent application and that the contract
was made with respect to that application3

The petitioner

42

used the patent laws, and the application had value because
of its potentiality under the patent laws,,

No one was paid

a substantial amount for a nonexclusive license to make this
article»
As the affidavit of the petitioner appearing on
page 55 of the record shows, the keyholder was disclosed to
several commercial enterprises while negotiations with the
respondent were pending»

If Quick Point; had not come to an

agreement with the petitioner for an exclusive license, the
petitioner could have sought to make an agreement with one of
the other commercial enterprises»

If an exclusive license

had been granted to a competing company, Quick Point would
have been frozen out, if the patent was granted, and, for
practical purposes, could not have made the article while the
patent application was pending»
On the other hand, Quick Point knew that if the
petitioner obtained the patent on the device, the exclusive
license would assure that Quick Point held the right to
manufacture the keyholder free from competition for the
patent period»
Quick Point, in this case, bargained not only for
disclosure but also for the future exclusive right to use the
invention once the patent was obtained»
In short, the patent application, which was an
integral part of the process

established by the government

43
under the patent laws# pursuant to the patent clause in the
Constitution # gave the petitioner bargaining leverage which
she could not have had if she had not first filed a patent
application»
The mere fact of the patent application gave the
petitioner — gave the respondent considerable likelihood of
protection against competitors# while the patent application
was pending? and in this way the patent law was used as
leverage for the petitioner's benefit»
But the patent laws gave more»
a patent would be obtained»

They gave hope that

And in that event# the contract

gave Quick Point the exclusive right to make and sell the
item»

This was a prospect made possible by the patent laws#

and it was fully utilized by the petitioner hare»
The petitioner entered into the patent process and
she obtained a substantial benefit# because she invoked the
patent laws»

Without the patent application# she would have

been in no position at all to obtain substantial royalties
for this time •— for this item# which was incapable of
exploitation without full disclosure»
She used the patent law successfully# even though
she did not obtain a patent# and her contract should be
qualified by law in accordance with the principles which have
been developed in several patent cases».
Ites important' again to recall that we are not

44
dealing here with a continuing trade secret, as in Kewanee,
There was a secret here, but it was inherently time-lirnited»
Once the article was made and marketed, ‘the secret was fully
disclosed»
And -thus, as far as the objective of disclosure
under the patent system is concerned, a decision in favor of
Quick Point will have no adverse effect»

The holder of an

idea for a secret device like this can keep it to himself if
he wishes to do so, but if he wants to realize on it he must
disclose it» There is no alternative»
He can of course apply for a patent without licens­
ing the device, in which case there will be no disclosure until
a patent has issued? and ha will have no return from the idea
while the patent is pending»
On the other hand, he can license the idea with
or without applying for a patent»

If he licenses the idea

without applying for a patent, he can only hope to obtain
head start value from the licensee»

And I suggest in this

case that that would be very small© since the idea will be
fully disclosed as soon as the licensee puts the item on the
market»
The

only way that the inventor can hope to get

more is to apply for a patent, thus utilizing the patent laws,
and than seek to license the patent application and the
hoped-for patent»

That is what was done here»

The petitioner

45

chose to proceed under the patent system, arid she got great
leverage from the patent system.

Who would have paid very

much for this idea on a nonexclusive basis?

Which would have

been the situation if no patent had been applied for.
Now, turning again to I^ewanes, I point out that it
did not involve license situation, there was no question about
the validity of a license or about the validity of a license
extending for an indefinite period.

What it involved was a

classic trade secret breach of employment contract situation,
in which the Court was asked to strike down a longstanding
%
body of State trade secret law which served important public
policy objectives.

This the Court was understandably reluctant

to do.
QUESTION g

Important public policy objectives of the

State?
MR. GRISWOLDs

Important public policy objectives

of the State, yes, Mr. Justice, involving the sanctity of
fiduciary relations between employers and employees within
the State.
QUESTION? Well, can't we assume that if the State
of Missouri, or whatever State this contract was drawn in,
chose to enforce tills contract, it viewed it as serving
important public policy?
MR. GRISWOLDs

I think, Mr. Justice, that this

Court would have to decide, and my suggestion would be that

46
whatever the public policy objectives may be, they are not
nearly as importanto

The sole issue here is whether it is

valid to make a contract with respect to a x}®nding patent
application which calls for indefinite royalties extending
beyond the period when royalties would be payable if a patent
was allotted»
QUESTIONs

Well, isn't the sole issue also whether

federal patent law preempts State law enforcing this contract?
MRo GRISWOLDs

Yss? Mr» Justice, to that extento

And that step has long since been taken„

Perhaps the most

clearest and striking case being Brulofc te vc Thysp where the
Court held that no matter what the State contract law was,
a contract calling for the payment of royalties after a patent
had expired vras invalid» And I am contending here that a
contract calling for the payment of royalties without a limit
of time? made with respect to a specific pending patent
application, should likewise not be construed to call for the
payment of royalties for an indefinite period»

Because that

would be contrary to the scope, effect, objective of the
patent laws»
And I think hare is perhaps a better answer to Mra
Justice Stevens3 question;

there is here the same interfere

ence with the patent laws that there was in Brulotte v^_Thy s „
Here there is a disclosure, there is an obtaining of royalties
with respect to the disclosure, there is, if this contract

47
is invalid, a perpetual handicapping of this competitor in
the market with inevitable increase in the overall price that
the public must pay for the itemc

And, as in Brulotte v» Thys

the contract was held to bs invalid after the patent period
expired»
here»

I don't know just when the contract becomes invalid

I think that a very good case can be made for the

proposition that royalties were not due under this contract
after the patent application was abandoned»

We don't have

to deal with that» Thera is no question in this case with
respect to the payment of royalties during the patent
application period»
There isn't much question with respect to payments
for a number of years — there isn't any question with respect
to the payment of royalties for 14 years after the patent
application was abandoned, because those royalties were paid,
and this suit is not an effort to get them back? this suit is
a suit for a declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that
under proper application of the scope of the patent laws
any provision in State law, which calls for the payment of
royalties for an indefinite period under a contract made
specifically with respect to a patent application, is invalid»
QUESTIONi

Mr» Griswoldg, I suppose one could describe

the federal, policy at stake in Brulotte as a policy against
allowing a patent monopoly to have any reward in addition to
the raonopoly itself, and enlarge the patent monopoly beyond

48

the terms of the patent grant? that you can't obtain royalties
on unpatented articles sold with the patent, or on a period
after the monopoly protection has expired0

I don't see how

that federal policy is implicated by this case when there's
no monopoly in the first placee
MR0 GRISWOLD?

I think, Mrc Justice, the answer is

that here there was a preliminary or in gait monopolyo

There

was the hope and expectation that a patent monopoly would be
obtained, and there was a contract made with respect to that
hope and expectation which provided for larger royalties
undoubtedly them would have been available if no patent
application had been filedo
And so the patent laws have been used to obtain a
larger tribute from the public, to use it in that sense, than
would have been obtained if the patent laws had not been
invoked,,

And that, I suggest, is essentially the considera­

tion which was behind this Court's decision in
QUESTIONs

Mr, Griswold, but the parties also

QUESTIONs

In 'the Lear case?

No, this case.

That is, she would have had, as I suggested before, —
MR, GRISWOLD?

I don't know whether they would or

not, it's hard to *»“ after all, the contract that was made
in 1956 was on® which called for an aggregate of $200,000
royalties,
QUESTIONs

Well, it isn't so difficult.

You just

taka the period after the five years and double the royalties
and add that to the

203, and then add, if you could calculate

it, all the people who copied the idea and would have had to
pay license fees,
MR, GRISWOLD?

I don't see hovr that is applicable

hero, but I «- particularly with respect to the Lear case,
where it was held that if the licensee attacks the patent and
is successful, no royalties are due from the time when he
states that he will attack the patent,

And we find it

difficult to think that the licensor of a patent application
should stand in a better position than a person who has a good
enough invention so that he gets a patent, or even one like
Lear, who has a good enough invention so that he gets a
patent but it is later held to be invalid.
There is on® point to which. I would like to make
reference.

Twice, while this was going on, Quick Point

asserted, through on© means or another, its obligation to

51
pay royalties»

That, of course, does not necessarily mean

indefinitely, but to continue to pay royalties»

I would point

out that one of those letters was by its patent counsel,
and it may well have been simply erroneous»

It was written

before the decisions of this Court in Sears and Compco, and
Brulotte v» Thys, and the Lear case, and this Court has been
a great teacher in this area over the past 15 years, and
finally, Quick Point may well have thought it equitable or
generous to continue making such payments because for some
tiro© it was the only on® marketing the keyholder»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Griswold, do you consider Kewanes

and Goldstein teaching cases as well as Brulotte and Compco?
MR» GRISWOLD?

Oh, yes, Mr» Justice, of course»

And Kewanee is an excellent oasa, that I am vary much pleased
with®
QUESTIONs

I should think you would be!

[Laughter» 3
MR» GRISWOLD?

But it has no relation to this case,

because tills case doss not involve a trade secret of the sort
which caused the concern of the'. Court in the lewanee case and
the Kewanee case did not involve a licensing situation»
QUESTION?

Mr» Griswold, the record contains, on

page 39, a letter written in 1961 from counsel for Quick
Point to Mrs» Leopoldi then, stating flatly that "even if no
patent is ever granted »»» Quick Point, is obligated to pay

52

royalties in respect of any key holders manufactured by it in
accordance with any disclosure of said application. 3

Do you

have any comment about that letter?
MRo GRISWOLDS

Well, Mr. Justice, that's what I

thought 1 was commenting on.

That, in the first place, he

may well have been wrong? he was not an officer of the companyt
he was patent counsel? in the second place, it was written
before Sears and Compaq and Thys and Lear, as to which the
Court, I suggest, has been a great teacher, as things have
developed.

Ha may well have thought that was the law when

he did it.
But I suggest that the decisions of this Court have
shown that it’s no longer the lav?.

And finally, Quick Point

may simply have wanted to be generous.

They had had good

relations with this lady, and until the LgeO's they did not
have any competition, as a practical matter.

It was only when,

beginning in the lata 1960's, they found themselves at a
heavy competitive disadvantage.

You may say only two and a

half percent royalty, but that may be half the profit.
It was only then that they began to explore the
✓

situation, and come to the conclusion that the decisions of
this Court pointed clearly in the direction that a license
made with respect to a patent application should not give
greater rights than would have been obtained if a patent had
actually bean granted.

Thank you®

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY C, LEE COOK, JR, * ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF '[TIE PETITIONER
MR, COOKs

Just briefly * may it please the Court,

Ied like to deal specifically with this letter which
was referred to by Dean Griswold just at the end of his
argument* because that letter* I think* also* not only deals
with the question of what was the intention of the parties*
but answers also the argument about the policy really that's
involved here* in terms of whether some federal policy is
thwarted by the existence of the patent application.
The argument of respondent on that point ignores* I
believe* the fact that the parties did specifically cantem™
plate that no patent would issue and that in that event the
royalty would be reduced to two and a half percent.
He also argues that;* why would anyone sign such
agreement?

Or why would anyone enter into an agreement such

as 'this''if he could not get exclusivity?
This letter* which is on page 39 of the record* I
believe* clearly demonstrates that the parties contemplated
that they might not get exclusivity®

Indeed* it says that

BWe remind you that under the license agreement — the
agreement is in respect of the disclosure»/’ and not the claims.

54
It Is the claims which give the exclusivity»

And he is saying

here that "even if we get a patent, we may not have
exclusivity with respect to what we are obligated to pay you
royalties on0m
QUESTIONt

Mr» Cook, whafc if a patent had issued?

First of all, there would have been a continuing obligation
to pay five percent, not two and a half percent»
MR» COOK*

Yes®

QUESTION %

But then 17 years had expired, after the

issuance of the patent, would the obligation have continued?
MR» COOKs

In my opinion it would not, under this

Court's decision in Brulotte»

Because under those circum­

stances, -«QUESTION:

It’s pretty clear, isn’t it, under

Brulotte?
MR® COOKs

Yes-, because under those circumstances

the patent owner has taken something from the public*,

It

has taken that extraordinary grant of the right to exclude
the entire public from

making, using or selling this device»

And in Brulotte, if the Court will recall, the
opinion specifically said that the rationale here does not
apply to contracts involving unpatented machines»

The

rationale of Brulotte was, as Mr» Justice Stevens pointed out,
if you give an inventor a monopoly by a patent, you cannot
permit him to expand that monopoly, whether to nonpatented

55

articles or beyond the 17 years0
But in this case, Aronson has taken nothing from the
public» The existence of the patent application gives her
nothing against the public, it gives her no right to exclude
others, and 'there is no public policy that was «— certainly
not the policy that was involved in Brulotte? it has no
application here»
QUESTION:

Well? Mr» Griswold has suggested that

there was at least a light wind in her sails by virtue of
being able to put the statement "patent pending" on the —
MR» COOKs

Welly we're not — the record doesn't

show for sura that anybody did put "patent pending" on
any Idling in this case»
QUESTIONs

But they could have,

MR» COOK2

But they could have,,

There's no doubt

about that»
But also they could have «" you see, the argument,
I believe, of the respondent really deserts the Court of
Appeals, because what the Court of Appeals said is that the
important thing here is that the invention wasn't secret,
it was somehow in the public domain»
But if we had had a patent application on an
invention which was secret

and then abandoned the patent

application, the Court of Appeals would have enforced that
agreement»

And yet the very same in terrorem effect, if you

56

want to call it that, would be present0

And indeed in Kewanee

there was no question ”®* the decision was not that you can
enforce the trade secret if you haven't applied for a patent
on it? the decision was that you can enforce your rights in
the trade secreto
QUESTION s

Why do you £3upposa the royalty rate was

higher in this contract up until ~ than it was after the
patent was denied?
MRo COOKs

I think it is clear that the parties

hoped there would be a patent.»
QUESTIONS

find if there 'wasn’t, why “*=*

Well, they were paying — they were

paying for the right to use a mechanism on which a patent
application was filed»
MR» COOKs

Exactly.,

And I believe, Your Honor, that

if file parties -» the parties hoped there would be a patent,
and if there had been a patent Quick Point would have been
willing to pay five percent royalties»

And that —»

QUESTIONs Do you think the case would be different
T

if there had been no provision for a reduction of the royalty?
MR» COOKs

Yes, I do»

QUESTION?

You do?

MRo COOKs

I do, because I think the reduction in

the royalty in this case shows that the parties specifically
contemplated that there would —» that the possibility of a
patent issuing —

57
QUESTIONS So if there hadn't been a provision for a
reduction of the royalty in the event there was no patenti,
then you would agree they were piggybacking on the patent?
MR. CCQKs

Nos X would not agree to that, Your Honorc

QUESTIONs

You just say that it would be a different:

MR. COOKs

Yes.

case?

QUESTION t
MR. COOKs

And what would be the result?
Well; you sea, it would depend upon the

intention of the partias.

And I think the intention of the

parties is road® vary clear here.
QUESTION* Well; the chief reason why they have a
reduction in the patent royalty from five to two and a half
percent is because two arm's-length parties agreed on it.
MR. COOKs

Exactly^ and if —

QUESTION: And it doesn't really make much difference
■**« or does it “*» why they agreed on it?
MR. COOKs

Well; I don’t think it does, but I think

in this particular case the fact is they agreed on it because
they contemplated that a petent might not issue; and Quick
Point was willing to pay the two and a half percent for what
Dear:: Griswold had referred to as the head-start value.
We do know that that head-start value was very
substantial her®. They didn't get competitors in this business
until the late 1960!a; even though the patent was long out of

58
■»“ the patent application was long out of existence„
The fast of the matter is that if there is a head»
start value, there’s no federal interest in having the court
interfere with deciding what that value is0

If the parties,

in an am’s-length negotiation, agree that that value is two
and a half percent, why should the court interfere with that?
Why shouldn't th© courts permit -She Stats law to enforce that
agreement?
Now, if I can touch just briefly on the question of
a trade secrete There is no doubt that when this invention
was first disclosed to Quick Point, it was a trade secreto
The fact that it was secret, is conceded in respondent's briefc
It was stipulated to in this recordo

The fact that it was of

value is conceded in respondent's brief, because they concede
that we were entitled to substantial payments for that
disclosuree
The fact that it later became public, by reason of
the sale, does not mean that when the contract was entered
into it was a secreto

But even if it were not a trade

secret within the technical definition of trade secrets, it
wouldn’t make any difference, because the principle involved
her© should apply whether it’s an abstract idea — the concept
for a television program, an advertising theme, or anything
that may net be a trade sacret or a patentable invention?
the issue involved here iss
«

What is the federal policy which

59

is thwarted by permitting the States to enforce bargains
entered into between parties by which one agrees to share
with the other the profits he may make from the other's
invention or idea?
And that's exactly what; wa have here»

Arid if the

courts interfere with the enforcement of agreements like this,
we will be taking away from potential inventors, particularly
small inventors, th© strong incentive to make inventions.,
Otherwise they will be forced to either get a patent or, if
they can't get a patent, they will have to try to sell it
for a lump sum, which is a poor choice»
We respectfully urge you to reverse the decision
of the Court of Appeals»
