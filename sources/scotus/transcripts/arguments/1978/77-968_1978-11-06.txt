MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Detroit Edison Company against National Labor
Relations Board.
Mr. McGuinn, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGIMENT OF JOHN A. McGUINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McGUINN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case before you this morning concerns the
subject of employee aptitude testing and whether the duty to
bargain in good faith requirement of section 885 of the act
requires those increasing numbers of employers, both public
and private, who use testing — whether it requires them to
turn over to unions copies of the actual test involved, the
actual test sheets submitted by the applicants, and the scores^
achieved by the applicants linked with the name of the
applicant.
In order to place this issue in its proper factual
context, a few points have to be stressed.
First, the testa involved in this case — the
Minnesota Paper Form

Board Test and the six-part EPSAT

test — are aptitude tests.

They do not measure the

acquired knowledge needed for the Detroit Edison Instrument Man

4
They just test his ability to get tthat knowledge.
And the job involved in. this case, the Instrument
Man job, is one of critical importance to this company.

This

employee works on precision instruments, technically complex.
He, in fact, is in charge of the nervous system of
the power plant.
Now, the record in this case; shows that the Instru­
ment Man test battery is highly predictive of success on the
job.

There is an 80 percent chance that those scoring above

the 10.3 cutoff score will be successful performers on the
job, and conversely, there is an 80 percent chance that those
scoring below 10.3 will be unsuccessfvil instrument men.
QUESTION;

Since this isn't a Title VII case, how

does that bear on your argument here?
MR. McGUINN:

It bears on the arguments of the

relevance of the test items to the union.

If we take it as a

given that this test is a valid predicter of performance on
the job, I say that the union does not need the test items
themselves, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in order to carry on the
statutory function of representing the employees.
QUESTION;

Whereas if the test were not predictive

at all, you would feel the union had a greater right of
access to it?
MR. McGUINN;

Yes.

I think if we had a very suspect

here, yes, the test should be turned over to a psychologist

5

of the union's choice for him to make a determination.
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't want the general

disclosure?
MR. McGUINN:
disclosure.

No, I would not want general

That ruins the validity of the test.

QUESTION:

Well, does Detroit Edison object to the

disclosure that was ordered by the hearing examiner here?
MR. McGUINN:

No, Your Honor, it did not.

The

Detroit Edison Company, in fact, made that suggestion at the
outset of the unfair labor practice hearing to the administrative
law judge.

It's exactly the suggestion that he took; that is

to turn it over to the psychologist of the union's choice.
Next, I think you must understand that this company
furnished the union with what Judge White — dissenting Judge
White — found was a wealth of information on its testing
program.
This included the two validation studies done on
the test? some 146 sample items similar to but not identical
to the

items on the two tests themselves; an explanation of

the battery weights and the raw scores on the tests; the
raw scores achieved by the applicants on the tests; but not
linking it with the

name of the applicant, putting it by

alphabetical designation; and offered to release the scores
linked with the names of the applicants for any applicant
who consented to such release; and finally, and most

6

importantly, we offered to disclose the test to a qualified
psychologist of the union's choice.
The final factual consideration is that during the
pendency of the Labor Board case, the union prosecuted
grievances of the unsuccessful applicants to arbitration.
In this proceedings, the union sought copies of the
same test materials that they are seeking in this case.
And the arbitrator found that in view of the wealth of
materials that the company did furnish, that production of the
actual tests was irrelevant to his consideration of the case.
And also as a result of that proceeding, I think you
should know that the arbitrator effected a compromise between
the position of the union and the position of the company
whereby he told the company to reconsider three applicants
who scored just below the 10,3 cutoff.
And as a result of that reconsideration, the company
in fact hired one of those three persons.
This then is the broad factual context in which
this company was found to have violated the National Labor
Relations Act.
In the classical argument of this case would start
with an analysis of whether the test information was of
probable relevance and usefulness to the union in carrying
out its statutory duties and responsibilities under the
Acme case.

7
But with your indulgence, I would like to leap
ahead and assume for the moment and for the purposes of
argument, that this information had some marginal relevance
to the union's function»
Our conclusion is still the same.

The test

material should not be turned over to the union directly.
Why?
I think we should start with the only common premise
we share with the National Labor Relations Board in this case,
and that is, as the Board acknowledges in footnote 25 of its
brief, there is a very strong public policy in favor of
preventing compromise of employment tests through dissemination.
That public policy is rooted in the common sense
fair play notion that distribution of an employment aptitude
test to persons who may take the test in the future destroys
the validity of the tests as predictors of employee performance
and places those who have not seen the test at a competitive
disadvantage to those who have seen the test.
This common sense fair play notion has been
incorporated in the standards for educational and pscyhological
tests and manuals published by the American Psychological
Association, which

in turn has been incorporated into the

EEOC guidelines on testing? and now, since the filing of our
brief, joint agency guidelines on testing.
The standard 15 of the APA standards states that

3

for tests other than achievement tests, prior knowledge of the
test items can destroy validity»
And standard J2 of those same standards states
that test scores should be reported only to those qualified
to interpret them»
And the EEOC guidelines expressly require safeguards
to protect the security of test scores.
This Court, on three recent occasions — the Griggs
case, the Albemarle case, and the Washington v, Davis case —
has held that the EEOC guidelines are entitled to great
deference and should be regarded as expressing the will of
Congress,
This Court, in the Albemarle case, specifically
approved the EEOC's reliance on the APA standards I just
mentioned.
Common sense fair play concepts behind employment
test security was recently underlined by the 2nd Circuit in
the Kirkland case, where that court struck down a district
court ruling which would have provided that

any new employment

test would be reviewed by the plaintiffs.
The Board itself, prior to this case, acknowledged
this common sense fair play concept when its general counsel
in I960 refused to even issue a complaint in which the
union sought to review employment aptitude tests.
The Board's general counsel at that time referred

9

to the quote, unique character of the tests and held that
advance inspections would permit the contents of the tests
to be widely disseminated, thus impairing the usefulness
of the tests.
Now the Board’s sole answer to this admitted strong
public policy was to invent what they called a restriction,
a hortatory statement that the union was not to copy the test
or to disseminate, and was to return them to the company after
the arbitration proceeding.
No restriction at all was placed on the dissemination
of the test scores linked with the name of the applicant.
This could presumably be printed in the Detroit Free Press.
QUESTIONs

But that wouldn't compromise the test?

MR. McGUINN:

No, it would not compromise the test.

It would compromise the validity, as seen by the EEOC.

The

EEOC says that the test scores should not be distributed.
You see, it leads to a situation where somebody who
scores 12.5 on this is then compared to somebody who scored
12.3 on it; there is no reason — as the arbitrator said, this
test is good because it doesn't compare somebody's score
with that of somebody

else's score.

It is just reported

in terras of, not recommended or accepted.
QUESTIONs

I'm puzzled by your reliance on the EEOC

guidelines as compared to the Bocird's action here.

Because

as I recall the EEOC is not charged by law with making

10

interpretative -- with actual filling in blanks in the statute.
And the Board, I've always assumed,

had more

authority in its adjudicatory function than EEOC did,
MR, McGUINN:

Well, my reliance on the EEOC guidelines,

Your Honor, is the reliance that this Court placed on those
guidelines -QUESTIONs

Yes, but we’ve never said that the EEOC

power is equivalent to a board or an agency that has power
to issue regulations.
QUESTION;

And we refused to follow them in Gilbert

v. General Electric.
MR. McGUINN;

Well, that's correct.

But I can only

say what the Board did in the Albemarle case and the Washington
v. Davis case, and they said, these guidelines were entitled
to, quote, great deference, end quote, should be regarded as
expressing the will of Congress.
Those are the Court’s words.
So I think that when I’m placed in the position of
the Detroit Edison Company, where I have to follow Title VII
as well as follow the National Labor Relations Board, you put
me into an impossible situation when you say, give me the
tests and the test scores.
As I said, ncrestriction at all was placed on the
dissemination of the test scores linked to the name of the
applicant.

11
Now the Board seems -QUESTIONi

But there was on the tests?

MR. McGUINN:
QUESTION 5

Yes.

And then do you say that we — that that

restriction does not satisfy you?
MR. McGUINN: Yes.

Like dissenting Judge White on the

Court of Appeals, I can only suggest to you that the board's
position is really naive in the real vrorld in which we find
ourselves.
It is really naive because, once the materials have
been given to the union, the company has lost control over
them.

And it places on the company the admittedly new and

very difficult burden of policing and enforcing that
restriction.
Second, as organisations properly responsive to their
members desires, without the professional standards and
responsibilities of professional psychologists, unions are in
a uniquely poor position to prevent dissemination of
materials.
The real world of today, with the ubiquitous
copying machine which everyone has, requires extraordinary
measures of security to prevent widespread dissemination.
These are not measures ordinarily used or available
to labor organizations.
QUESTION:
on the union's —

But you think you could rely, though,

12
MR. McGUINN;
QUESTION :

Psychologist?

-- psychologist?

MR. McGUINNs

Yes.

That psychologist is under a

professional responsibility not to divulge tests and test
scores linked to the name of the applicant.
Yes.
it's a risk

We're taking a risk —■ a very large risk.

But

that strikes the proper kind of balance.

QUESTIONS

But you think we must assume the union

would disobey an order?
MR. McGUINN:
thcit assumption.

No, I don't think you have to make

I think we’re talking more here about

inadvertent disclosure, the kind of thing where the desk is
put on somebody’s desk, and somebody picks it up, and it's
in a drawer without proper safeguards.
I think that’s the kind of situation we’re really
talking to here as opposed to the intentional business.
However, I think

we would be a little naive if we

didn’t realise that this record shows a decades-long hostility
by this union to the entire concept of promotion other than
promotion by

seniority.

In other words, hostility to

testing.
Like dissenting Judge White, I can only wonder why
the union, after being given a wealth of materials on the
testing program, still wants copies of the actual tests and
the actual test sheets.

13
QUESTION;

Mr. McGuinn?

MR. McGUINN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

I missed something.

Why is the psychiatrist important to sea this?
MR, McGUINN:

The psychologist — the importance of

the psychologist to this, Mr, Justice Marshall, is that what
we have here is an aptitude exam.

In other words, it is not

a test of what is required of the: Instrument Man.
Therefore -QUESTION;

In other words, they're experts in the

testing business.
MR, McGUINN %

The psychologists are the experts in

the testing business.
QUESTION;

— other than psychologists.

MR. McGUINN s
QUESTION;

Pardon?

There's some: experts that are not

psychologists.
MR. McGUINN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. McGUINNs
QUESTION;

Well, that's correct too, Your Honor.

But I think --

But these are testers.

These psychologists

are experts in the testing field,,
MR. McGUINN;
QUESTION;

Yes.

That's what you were looking for?

MR. McGUINNs

That's right.

That's right.

14
QUESTIONs

Thank you.

QUESTION s

I can fully understand why the expertise

of a psychologist would be an important ingredient in the
devising of these test batteries.

But I should think any

schoolboy could mark the papers, so to speak,
MR. McGUINNs

couldn't he?

Yes, the marking of the papers is

basically a clerical function.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

I suppose there are multiple

choice questions —
MR. McGUINN:
QUESTION:

There are multiple choice questions.

-— or true and false, something like that.

MR. McGUINNs

You can see

the samples in the

appendix as a matter of fact.
QUESTION?

I mean, a machine could almost do it.

MR. McGUINNs

Yes.

In this case, a machine doesn't

do it, it's done by
QUESTION:

But any literate layman could do it?

MR. McGUINNs

That's correct.

And we have people

within the psychology unit who do actually grade these tests.
QUESTIONs

But you don't need a psychologist's

expertise to grade them, do you?
MR. McGUINN:

No, you do not.

As it happens, the

record in this case shows they do have expertise, but that is
not necessary, obviously, to grade a multiple choice test.
QUESTION:

Mr. McGuinn, in the Griggs case — and

15
I don't mean to belabor this point unduly — where you in
your brief

quoted as saying that EEOC guidelines are to be

regarded as expressing the will of Congress.

And you have a

page citation to Griggs at 401 U.S. 434.
1

i

There is a sentence on page 434 that says, since the
Act and its legislative history supports the commission's
constructions, this affords good reasons to treat the
guidelines as expressing the will of Congress.
I take it you would want your brief qualified in
the same way?
MR. McGUINN;

Of course.

I think the next problem we have —- I have --- with
the restriction is that there is a built-in ambiguity about
this restriction, about just what individuals comprise the
union to whom I'm supposed to give over these materials.
As I showed in my brief, this could be a very few
people or it could be a very large number of people.
The Board's order, or its restriction, does not make it clear
who it is to run to.
And all of those persons who would be seeing these
materials are also employees of the company who would be in a
position to take the test themselves in the future.
And the Board is clearly off the mark when it suggests
that we, the company, could extract a pledge from these
union officials that they would never take the test in the

16
future.
I can think of no clearer violation of section
8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act to tell the union officials they
mu3t forego promotional opportunities because of their
membership and activities in regard to a labor union.
Fifth, even if the company were able to detect a
violation of the restriction, you would have no independent
remedy.

You would have to rely upon the Board8s general

counsel to seek contempt proceedings in the Court of Appeals.
And it6s very difficult for me to consider how a
union can be held in contempt when the basic order runs against
the company and not the union, and the union wasn’t even a
party to the proceedings in the Court of Appeals.
And sixth, even if the union were found liable in
contempt for a violation of the restriction, there is no
adequate remedy, since this company's testing program will
have been gutted, and it would tcike years to make another revalidation study.

• r

And seventh, if this Court were to affirm the decision
of the 6th Circuit on the basis of the judicial protective
order and the sanction of contempt "for its violations, what
will happen next fohen unions generally seek such information
from other employers?
Must employers, in order

to obtain this judicial

contempt protection, refuse again to disclose the information?

17

Go through a meaningless Board proceeding? a meaningless
Court of Appeals proceeding? just to get the judicial
contempt sanction protection»
Literally, that's the only way that another employer
down the road is going to be able to do it»

And yet that

makes no common sense at all.
And the only other alternative would be for the
employer to extract a contractual commitment against
disseminating the material from the union»

And the only

remedy for a violation of that is an ordinary breach of
contract suit»
Thus, it is apparent that even this chimera of
judicial contempt sanction protection will extend no further
than the case in front of you today, if it’s accepted by this
Court.
Let me now leap backward for a moment and talk about
the threshold question of whether the testing materials involved
had any probable relevance or usefulness to the union under
this Court’s decision in Acme

Industrial Company»

And here we have to distinguish between the tests
and test sheets on the one hand, and the v.est scores linked
with the name of the applicant on the other»
Going first to the tests, consider first the wealth
of material that the union was given about the testing
program, including the validation studies themselves, including

18
the sample questions given to the union.
Next* consider that the three professional industrial
psychologists who testified in either the arbitration case
or the Board hearing, each concluded that a review of the test
itself would not be helpful in determining whether the
particular test was valid.
QUESTIONS

Mr. McGuinn, to get back for a moment —

MR. McGUINNs
QUESTION:

Yes.

— to what you just told us.

Do you

concede that 8(a)(5) required the company to give what it did
give, the so-called wealth of material?
MR. McGUINNs
QUESTION:

You do?

MR. McGUINNs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

And therefore you do —

MR. McGUINNs

We think that that was a valid way of

responding to the union’s request for information.

We didn’t

have to respond to it in exactly the way the union wanted to
get it.
We gave what we considered to be the most relevant
information, and that is the validation studies themselves.
QUESTION:

And you do concede that 8(a)(5) required

you to do as much as you did?
MR. McGUINNs

Turn over the validation studies, yes.

I think we went one step further when we gave them

19
sample copies of the — of items that were similar to but
not the same as items on the test itself.

I think that was a

very helpful thing.
I don't know whether that was, strictly speaking,
required by the Act.

I think the validation studies were.

In answer to these three professional

industrial

psychologists, the union produced no vdtness whatsoever who
was a professional psychologist, and the Board produced none.
So that evidence is uncontroverted on this record.
Another potent consideration on the issue of
relevancy, in my opinion, is the fact that the arbitrator
himself concluded that a review of the tests would prove
nothing, and that the union's case was in no way damaged by
lack of access to the tests.
Of course this Court has on many occasions held that
arbitration is the preferred method of solving labor
relations disputes.

That was done in this case,

and it was

done without the necessity of the production of the tests.
QUESTION?
Stewart's questions

Mr. McGuinn, just to follow up on Justice
Supposing there had been no arbitration

at all, and the union just made a demand out of the blue for
possible future use in connection with possible arbitration.
Would you have had an 8(a)(5) obligation to comply?
MR. McGUINNs
in other words?

Without an actual case or controversy,

20

QUESTION;

Correct.

MR. McGUINNs

I think that this would have to be in

conjunction with a real live case.

I just don’t think these

academic inquiries sent to a company in large —
QUESTIONS!

But once the arbitration proceeding was

over, did not the inquiry become academic?
MR. McGUINNs

Well it is not# strictly speaking,

\

academic now.

Because the arbitrator, pursuant to the

agreement of both parties, said that the arbitration proceeding
could be reinstituted if the testing materials were, in fact,
ordered to be produced by a court..
QUESTIONS
unnecessary for his

But didn’t he conclude that they were
decision?

MR. McGUINNs

That's right.

I don't think that the

arbitrator is really going to change his mind if this Court
should determine that the tests should foe made public.
QUESTION;

I'm just a little puzzled as to whether

ve should decide the case on the

theory that they’re needed

cor this particular arbitration, which may be reopened, or that
they're needed in sort of a generaway for future use in
bargaining, whatever may arise.
Sort of ~ yes, that's right, to police compliance
vith the agreement in the future.
I'm just having a little trouble identifying
vhat the standard of reference is we’re supposed to judge

21

the case by.
MR. McGUINN;

That's an interesting point, whether

an academic inquiry that comes in out of

,the blue, we would

like to see XYZ material concerning your testing program,
whether that would lead to an 8(a)(5) kind of answer.
I tend to — this company believes in disclosing as
much as possible to the employees.

And I think that the

answer to your question for this company, would be — yes,
we would be happy to disclose
QUESTION:

Well, I think I'm asking for a clarifi­

cation cf your answer to Justice Stewart.
Was your answer predicated on relationship to the
arbitration
MR. McGUINN:
QUESTION:

It was?

Mr. McGUINN:
QUESTION:

Yes„

Yes, it was.

Well, suppose after a grievance has been

processed, arbitrated, the union just files an unfair labor
practice claim that in the course of the arbitration the
employer committed an unfair labor practice.
Now, that's a perfectly -- the Board has jurisdiction
to hear that, I think.
MR. McGUINN:

But my question would be, what is

the request now relevant to?
QUESTION:

Ths; arbitration —

The request had — what they want

22
adjudicated is that the employer did commit an unfair labor
practice.
MR. MeGUINN:

Well, in order to commit an unfair

labor practice, we would have had to
QUESTION:
seems to me the

Well, I know.

But the proceeding -- it

request was made in the course of a — arid

refuted in the course of a grievance procedure.

And at that

time the union felt the employer was committing an unfair
labor practice.
And eventually, they took it to the Board.
MR. McGUINNs

Apparently, the premise of your

hypothetical was that the arbitration proceeding is now over.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We’ll resume there at

1:00 o’clock, Mr. McGuinn.
MR. McGUINNs

All right.

Thank you.

23

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Hr. McGuinn, you may

resume.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. McGUINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McGUINN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would like to answer the question pending at the
break, I believe from Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice
Stewart.
As I understand the question, is whether the company
is under a legal obligation to provide the union information
of the type provided by the company in this case, even if there
is no pending specific grievance.
And the answer to that is that once the union has
made a showing of probable relevance and usefulness, whether
that request is broadly framed or tied into a particular
grievance, the obligation attaches to disclose materials such
as the validation study.
And the reason for this is that we concede that the
testing program does affect wages and other conditions of em­
ployment .
QUESTIONs

That wasn*t my question.

Mr. McGUINNs

Maybe you could repeat your question.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Well, an hour

.has

24
elapsed.

Let Mr. Justice White try it again.
QUESTIONS

Well, suppose in an election, in a union

election campaign, the employer threatens some workers.

If

you vote, I'll fire you, or something.
In any event, the election is over, the union wins,
and the union files an unfair labor practice charge that the
employer committed an unfair labor practice.
Will it just be dismissed because the election is
over?
MR. McGUINN:

No, it will not, Your Honor.

And the same is true here.

Once the grievance is

resolved in arbitration and the union files an unfair
labor practice to seek the information —
QUESTIONs

They don't want the information.

They

just want a judgment that you committed an unfair practice
during the arbitration.
MR. McGUINNs

Yes.

It would not be moot, just

because the arbitration was concluded.
Does that answer your question?
QUESTIONS

Yes, it does.

MR. McGUINNs

I would like to reserve the remainder

of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr.

Come

Very well.

25

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, COMEs

Mr o Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The adminitrative law judge whose findings were
adopted by the Board found that the information requested by
the union, the test questions and the actual test papers and
scores of the employee-applicants for the Instrument Man jobs
were potentially relevant to the processing of the grievances
which had bee filed by the employees who had been

denied jobs

for failing to attain the cutoff score on the tests.
And thus under the principles of Acme Industrial,
the company violated its bargaining obligation in . refusing
to furnish this information to the un:,on.
Now before the Board, the company did not accept
the administrative law judge’s finding that the test
questions or the test battery and the test papers were relevant
to the processing of the pending grievance.
Indeed, it urged the Board to adopt that part of the
administrative law judge’s recommended order which provided
that the tests and test papers be turned over to a psychologist
selected by the union who in turn would make them available
to the union and let it use them to the extent necessary for
the processing of the grievances.
The company accepted only to the administrative

26
law judge’s finding that the union needed to lin> the employees'
names to the test scores»
In these circumstances, we submit that under
section 10(e) of the Act, which precludes judicial review of
contentions that were not raised before the Board, judicial
review of the question of the relevance of the test battery
and the test papers is foreclosed»
Normally, the companies avoid this foreclosure by
arguing, as it does in its brief, that it had no practical
reason to challenge the ALJ’s order because it had earlier
offered voluntarily to turn over this information to appease
the union.
The union's cross-exceptions put the company on
notice that the portion of the order which it was willing
to accept was subject to re-examination by the Board.
And we submit that if the company had any question
as to the relevancy of that information, that was the time
it should have urged that at least as an alternative contention
before the Board.
Accordingly, as we see it, and aa the court below
saw it, the basic question really presented here is whether
the Board reasonably exercised the broad remedial authority
that it has under section 10(e) of the Act —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Come?

MR. COMEs

Yes, sir.

27
QUESTION:

Did the company before the Board take

the position that the administrative law judge's order was
correct?
MR. COME:

Well, at two places in its exceptions,

which we have lodged with the clerk, they urge —- and the word
urge is theirs -- the Board to adopt that

part of the

administrative law judge's recommended order.
They accepted only to his recommendations insofar
as it required that the test scores linked to employee names
be turned over.
QUESTION:

But they had no reason to

accept to his

proviso that it be turned over only to a psychologist, since
that favored them rather than disfavored them.
MR. COME:

That is their argument.

However —

QUESTION:

Well, it's not only their argument, but

it's rather self-evident, isn't it?
MR. COME:

However, when the union cross-excepted

to that part of the order, it is our contention that that put
the company on notice that they would — might lose even that
part of the order, and therefore, in order to protect them­
selves, they should have raised with the Board at least the
alternative contention that we don't think that we committed
any unfair labor practice here to begin with.
But they never raised that before the Board, nor
did they do s© in their petition for a reconsideration after

28
the Board came down with its decision.
Now, as I say the basic question as we see it is
whether the Board was reasonable in ordering the company to
furnish to the union directly, rather than to a union-selected
psychologist, these test materials where the Board order
includes protective provisions to maintain the test’s

security»

Now, the purposes for which the union 'intended to
use the test materials did not necessarily require the aid
of a qualified psychologist»

The union was not challenging

the company’s showing that there was a high statistical
probability that those applicants who did well on the test
would do well in the Instrument Man job?for that presumably
you might need a trained psychologist,,
Rather, the union was attempting to show that the
tests were nevertheless unfair to certain applicants who
although they did poorly on the tests nonetheless had the
ability to perform the job»
The company acknowledges in its brief that those
scoring less than 10»3, which was its cutoff point, had at
least a 20 percent chance of becoming successful
Instrument Man —• men.
that

as

And the union was attempting to show

some of the low scorers were in this category.
r

For example, the vocabulary sample of the section
of the sample test.— and these weren!t the exact questions,
because the company only submitted a partial sample — asked

29

for definitions of words like '’homage/* "diabolic/* "imbue/'
and "droll/*
Now -QUESTIONS

They didn't ask —• didn't really ask

for definitions, but they were multiple choice Questions»
MR» COMEi

That is correct.

QUESTION»

Yes.

MR. COMEs

They wanted to know if you could recognise

what those words meant.
QUESTION?

Or what they did not mean.

MR. COMEs

Or what they did not mean.

QUESTIONS

In a multiple choice test, you don't need

to know the meaning of all the words.
MR. COMEs

Well, it hedps if you do.

QUESTION:

Well, yes it does.

But if you know the

range, you're in.
MR. COMEs

Yes.

Now, if the union could show, for example, that the
Instrument Man job did not require a &not*ledge of such items,
and that employee Smith, for example, who had past experience
in other jobs that were very closely related to the Instrument
Man job, or he had gotten uniformly high marks, scored less
than 10.3 simply because he missed these kinds of questions,
rather than those that were more job-related, it would have a
substantial basis for arguing to the arbitrator that Smith

30

should not have been disqualified for the job merely because
he failed to meet the 10„3 cutoff score»
QUESTION:

Well* it seems to me that that's a

fundamentally inconsistent position that you describe the
union as taking»
If the union begins by conceding the validity and
reliability of these tests, which are after all aptitude
tests, not proficiency tests, and aptitude tests are
presumably devised by people who knew what they're doing, and
the union by conceding their validity and reliability concedes
as much, than how possibly is it consistent for the union to
take the positions
unreliable.

Yes, but in some oases they’re invalid and

And where do you stop when you do that?

The company concedes, and the experts concede, that
they're 80 percent more or less reliable.

Those under 10„3

20 percent of them might be a good Instrument Man»
MR. COME:

QUESTIONS

Well, you’re asking for a perfect test,

MR. COMEs

But therein lies the basis for a grievance.

Even the arbitrator, on the basis of the fragmentary materials
that he had, found that there were at least three.employees —

QUESTION:

And the company hired one of them.

MR. COMEs

And on re-examining them, the company

should have been re-examined —

found that the qualification of at least one of them was
sufficient to override his low score on the test.
QUESTION:

Well ~

MR. COMEs

Now, the union as the statutory

32

representative of the employees, we submit, had a statutory
obligation, indeed, a duty to fairly represent these
employees; to insure that any employee who had the qualifications
for the job would at least have an opportunity to be considered
even though he happened to be a poor tester —
QUESTXONj

Well, why don't you just throw out the

MR. COME;

No ~

QUESTXONs

X don't see that that's at all a

test?

consistent position.
How can one concede the reliability and validity of
a test and than say, yet it doesn't show anything; there are
a lot of people who get below 10.3 who are in fact qualified.
That is saying the test is unreliable and invalid.
QUESTION;

Excuse me;

What more could the company

do than re-examine the three that were raised and when they
make a judgment, it isn't a judgment necessarily that they
were wrong the first time, but that they're willing on a
juarginal case to take a chance.
Does it mean any more than that?
MR. COME;

X submit that all that the validity of

the test shows is that it has a statistical probability.
There are still going to be employees who it could be shown
are capable of performing the job notwithstanding their
performance on the test.

33

QUESTION?
that that's true.

Well, we know in the testing field generally
There are people who pass bar examinations

who will never make lawyers, and there; are people who fail who
might make pretty good lawyers.
MR. COMEi

But the point that I'm making is, because

our basic position is that the company is not conceding — has
not accepted the union’s right to this information — is merely
to show why the Board, in framing the kind of order that it
framed, did not require the union to go to the expense of
necessarily hiring a

union psychologist,

The use that the union wanted to make of the test
didn't require that.

An intelligent

, someone with

familiarity with the operations of a powerplanfc, an engineer,
might have been more help to the union than would have been
a profession psychologist.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Come?

Can I get something straight.

You gave an example of the vocabulary multiple-choice
question and said that might not have anything to do with
the job,
I understood you to imply that the union would have
access not only to the form of the tests, the actual battery,
but t© the answers of particular employees.
Now, that isn’t right, is it?

Don’t they jutst get

the scores of the employees and the form of the test?
MR. COME s

I think that they need to know the names

34
of the employees and link them to the scores ~
QUESTIONs

But they would not know which questions

they missed and which they got correct, would they?
The employees.

X may misunderstand the record, and

that's really —- the material that must be disclosed, does
it include the actual tests that the employees took, or merely
their scores and a master copy of the test?
MR. COME?

No, the actual test papers itself.

QUESTIONi

Oh, I see.

MR. COME :

So that the union could have — without

X misunderstood.

Pardon me.

the whole picture, you would not know whether X scored low
because he missed the physical science and mathematical
questions that were german® to the Instrument Man job or
not.
You also would not b® able to know whether there was
any systematic bias in these tests.
QUESTIONt

Well, I can see how the union could take

that position if it hadn’t conceded that the tests were
relevant.
If it said that the employer is using this test

as

a ringer to really promote its own favorite sons or daughter;
but the union as I take it has conceded that the tests do
have a bearing and are permissible to use.
And the government, in its brief, says so.
MR. COME:

But as the administrative law judge

35
pointed out in his report on page 47A of the Appendix to the
position — to the petitions

There is a difference between

the statistical validity of the tests and the purpose for
which the union —- this information was relevant under the
National Labor Relations Actn
As the examiners, as the law judge pointed out# and
I don't want to read all of it# statistical and related data
which are available to the union are sufficient to prove the
validity of the psychological tests for the purpose used.
The statistics may indeed tend to show that the
tests are valid to serve the employer6s purpose# and they
may serve to identify those employees likely to do well on the
jGbc

However# the statistics do not serve to inform the
employees or their representatives whether the tests are
truly job-related or contain objectionable distortionsi whether
in sura # they tend to undercut respondent's contract commit­
ment to promote by seniority where the;re is no significant
difference.
And we submit that there is a crucial difference
between the principal validity of the test and whether or not
anindividual employee nonetheless has a substantial basis
for grieving —
QUESTION:

Nell# Mr. Come# once yon conceded — once

everyone agrees# as they apparently do here# that these

36

tests are valid, they have an objective purpose and they’re
fulfilling that purpose, is this fundamentally different
from any line-drawing process in which in many decisions
this Court has said, when there’s a line-drawing process, it
will inevitably include some people who should be excluded,
and exclude some people who

should be included.

Now that happens here, does it not?
MR. COME;

Yes, that does happen with respect to

decisions of this Court, and also with respect to drawing
legislation.
But I submit however that processing individual
employee difference — grievances under a collective bargaining
agreement allows for more than just the general line.

That's

the purpose of having a grievance procedure, and the right
of individual employees to file grievances.
QUESTIONs

Well, then the employer might as well ~

MR. COME:

The individual has a right, under these

procedures, we submit, to show that h:.s case should not be
covered by —
QUESTIONs

Well, if you’re going t© allow individual

appeals in each case, which is what this amounts to, then
why not just scrap the whole testing process, let the
employer make his management decisions, let the unions —■
if a grievance on anyone that ha does — they don't like?
MR. COME:

Well, because the test is a tool; it’s

37

a valuable tool.

But it is not the be-all and the end-all.

Now# with respect to the Board“s order here, it —
the argument is made that# well# it looks only after the
interests of the union; it does not protect other important
interests# namely# the company's interest in maintaining
test security.
Now# we think the answer to that is# as the
Court of Appeals

enforcing the Board's order stated# is

that the restrictions on use of the mj\te:rials and the obli­
gation to

return them to the company, which the court

enforced — in other words# the protective order — adequately
protects the company's interest in test security.
Now# the Board's order accords the union the right
to see and study the tests and to use the tests and information
contained therein to the extent necessary to process and
arbitrata the grievances.
However# the union is directed not to copy the
£©sts or otherwise use them for the purpose of exposing the
tests or the questions to employees who in the past or why
may in the future take these tests; or to anyone other than
the arbitrator.
And after the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding#
the union is required to return all copies to the company.
QUESTION;

What about the scores# individual scores?

MR. COME;

Well, as we read the terms fo the

38

protective order, which are set forth on page 55A, when the
Board of the —

As we read it, we believe that the Board was using
the administrative law judge using the word, tests, in the
generic sense to include not only the battery of tests,
namely, the test questions, but also the actual test papers.

so.

Instead, it did not do

It elected to permit the Board to enforce the order with

these conditions in the Court of Appesils.
In these circumstances, we submit that the union
is a stop to challenge the restrictions on the use of the
materials, and if it were to accept the test materials under
the ternis of the Board's order, as enforced by the Court of
Appeals, it would be bound by those «istrictions, and subject
to a contempt citation.
Beyond that, I wish to point, out that there are
important institutional reasons why it cannot be assumed, as
the company does, that the union would be breaching the

42
security of these test materials.
The union has had a bargaining relationship with
this company for over 28 years.
28 bargaining units.

MR. COMEs

But when they carae into this bargaining

The

union must represent fairly all the employees in the
bargaining unit.
QUESTIONS

Well, to the extent that the arbitrator

throws out the company's decision to promote someone who
did well on the test scores, they too are union members,
are they not?
MR. COMEs

That is correct.

QUESTION?

Mr. Coma, will you clarify something

for me?
Earlier in your argument I understood you to cite
as an example of why the union wanted these tests that it might
be able to prove that one of the applicants for this Instru­
ment Man B had performed that identical function or a
function very similar to it somewhere else very efficiently.
If that is so, in what way would the tests assist
the union?

Why can't it prove that anyway without having

possession . of the tests and the scores!
MR. COMEs
in this senses

Well, I think the test would assist it

You start with the fact that the tests do

have a statistical validity.
QUESTION?

let's assume that —

44
MR. COMEi

And

1

think that the union, rather than

just willy-nilly attempting to show that the employee xvas
capable of doing the job, wanted also to see what were the
types of questions that he missed on the test.
Now, if you could show that Smith missed the kinds
of questions that I was using for

illustration purposes, but

did very well on all the matematie&l and physical science
questions that were mor© germane to the Instrument Man job,
it would have a better case before the arbitrator than if it
merely had a situation where it could have been that the
reason that Smith did poorly was because he missed the
mathematical questions and the physical science questions.
I think that the type of questions that the employee
missed would be very relevant to the union and helpful to it
in prosecuting — in persuading the arbitrator that notwith­
standing the showing on the test, the employment should be —

If Smith had been an Instrument

he was competent to do the job, head and shoulders above
everybody else, because he’d already proved it.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Your time has expired,

Mr„ Come.
Thank you.
Mr. McGuinn, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. MeGUINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McGUINN;

Yes, Your Honor, I do want to answer

the contention made that we somehow lost our right to challenge
the relevance of these materials by the lack of filing an
}

exception to the finding of relevance in the Board proceedings.
Mr. Come is factually correct? no exception was
filed to that portion of the decision of the administrative
law judge.
The reason that no exception was filed was the
obvious one that the administrative law judge had adopted
a recommendation made by the company at the outset of the
unfair labor practice hearing.

The company did this

expressly, quote, to appease the union, end quote, not as a
c0nfession of the relevance of the materials.
What earthly reason would the company have for
filing an exception to that portion of a decision it deemed
favorable to it sown interests?

To file an exception in

those circumstances, in my opinion, would have been an

46
indication of bad faith, a withdrawal from a proposal that we
made to the union at the outset of the hearing»
I think it's most important in this context to
remember that this is a

labor relatione ease and that in

labor relations, each party often makes concessions to the
other in order to appease them.
That's how the system works.
