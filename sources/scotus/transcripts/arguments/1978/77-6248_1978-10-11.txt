MR. CHIE* JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 77-6248, Jacquelyn E. Hunter versus Gerald Wallee
Dean, Sheriff.
Kir. Bonnes:, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT 0* JAMES C. BONNER, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHAL* 0* THE PETITIONER
MR. BONNER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the court;
The fasts in this case are relatively simple and
pretty much undisputed,

I will go ever them briefly and then

we will launch into all the multi-faceted issues that this
case presents.
Jackie Hunter and a co-defendant were convicted on
guilty pleas of a burglary charge down in Terrell Superior Court
dawn in South Georgia near Albany.

They were each sentenced

two years probated provided that each pay fines and costs and
attorneys® fees that amounted to some $250.
The co-defendant's family was there in court.
paid the fine reasonably promptly or they paid the fine.

He
It

is not clear or either relevant I guess who, but in any
event he was released.
Jackie Hunter, when the trial judge inquired of
her whether she could pay a fine, held indicated to him that
she thought so and named two cousins —

4
QUESTION:

Did she think so that she thought so?

MR. BONNER:

Weil,, she said* yes* sir* but I do not

think I am mischaracterising it to put it that way,

I think

this whole episode has to be viewed as a typical one and that
is when a defendant is; appearing for pronouncement of sentence*
I think always —
QUESTION:

Well* she certainly did not use those

words o
MR. BONNER:

No* sir* she did not* but I think the

gist of them are that,
either.

I am not sure that that is important

But in any event* she did indicate that she could

pay a fine.

When the judge inquired further* she. named two

cousins that she was going to look to pay the fins.
QUESTION:

Eas any explanation ever been tendered

to the court why this was not done?
MR. BONNER:

No* sir.

No explanation was ever

tendered but* of course* there is no dispute that they did not
pay the fine,
QUESTION:

No* but has there ever been any explanation

from her about her representation to the court?
MR, BONNER:

Subsequently* two weeks after the

sentence was passed and it became apparent that her hopes
or expectations or whatever they were not going to come to
pass* she sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the Terrell
Superior Court with volunteer counsel.

The hearing occurred

5
before the ferial judge which is not normally -- it would simply
be a coincidence under Georgia law,

Also coincidentally it

occurred within the texm of court, when he still had plenary
power over the sentence in all respects,
But in any event, at that particular hearing which
I do not believe is part of the record before this Court, there
was no testimony taken.

The parties just simply proceeded

on the basis that she was in jail because she had no money.

There

was detailed explanation made at that time, no inquiry even
made at that time as to why the cousins had not paid, or even
what basis she had had for making that original statement,
QUESTIONs
the fine?

Mr, Bonner, may I ask you a question about

The notice of statute provides — there is a proviso

in it that provided such defendant shall not be entitled to
any rebate or refund of any part of such fine so paid in case
such probation shall bs revoked by law,
MR, BONNER:
QUESTION:

fes, sir,
is it fair to infer from that if the

defendant had paid the fine, had been put on probation and
served it without any wrongdoing, that at the expiration of the
period of probation the fine would have been repaid to her?
MR, BONNER:

No, sir, that is not correct.

I think

that this might be a mr.simpression that inadvertently arose
from one of the State’s arguments; that is, that the fine is
somehow at stake.

It is not of stake in a positive sense because the
fine, once paid,is lost»

Even successful completion of

probation, even if she had been discharged as a model citisen
after one year would not have resulted in that money being
refunded.

To this degree it does represent — there

is an

added risk, I might add here, that an affluent defendant faces
when he pays the fine immediately and hits the street.
If Jackie Hunter, for example, had been given leave
to pay her installments and had violated her probation after
two weeks, the relativa amount of money she would lose would
ba ~ she would not have lost the $2*50, probably only just a
small part of it-.
QUESTION:

But what if she had been sentenced to

pay the fine in installments, which she was conceivably able
to pay at the time the sentence was Imposed and then four
months later she defaulted on an installment and offered

tes­

timony on habeas that she simply was not able to financially
pay that installment?
MRo BONNER:

four Honor, that obviously is a question

that arises out of this.
QUESTION;
MR. BONNER;
QUESTION:
MR. BONNER:

What is your answer to it?
It is not our case.
No, but what is your answer to it?
Well, I do not think there is any doubt

that having been afforded a fair opportunity to pay the fine

7
in installments that, her probation could be revoked if she
failed to do it.
area.

Now obviously we are talking about a gray

There is a very large gray area here because it is

obviously a very easy question if she willfully fails to pay
the fine, if she has squandered a fair opportunity to make
installments payments$

it is quite another and of the spectrum

if she goes out and pounds every door in the County looking for
a job and she cannot get one.
But I think that that particular kind of question
is probably going to be buried in the proper use of the Courtes
discretion when it is faced with a revo(2ation petition if one
is every filed on that particular ground.

And it did not, /our

Honor? one may not aver be filed on that particular ground
because her probation officer may understand what efforts she
is making and simply not prefer those kind of charges.
QUESTION;

But does that not suggest that there is

a point in time at which the court has td make its decision and
that the factors that go into the constitutionality of its
decision has to be judged as of that in point in time rather
than four months later or six months later?
MR. BONNER;

I am not sure if I fully understand

what you mean.
QUESTIONs

Well, supposing in this case that the

trial judge was assured by her —now the record, is apparently
muddy and you claim otherwise

—

that she was able to pay the

8
fine or someone would pay it on her behalf.

And he therefore

quite consciously decided* ”1 will suspend the imposition of
sentence and impose a fine on you.*'

How can she come in four

months later and say* "Well* I know the representation was
made at the sentencing that I could pay the fins* but in fact
1 could not have paid it then,”
MR. BONNER:

Is that grounds for relief?

fes* sir.

I think that is a fair

characterisation of what happened here* according to the view
the Stats takes* but* yes* I think that would bs grounds.

I

think she would have the same kind of claim.
The question which would ba before the court* writ
of habeas corpus* is whether she is being confined essentially
for failure to pay money.

And X think once you have got that*

you enter into the full panoply of equal protection considera­
tion arises.
But let me run back just a minute to the question
that you asked me — we were talking about the gray area.

What

I want to avoid is the impression ~ there is no part of my
argument that says that Jackie Hunter cannot be locked up if
she cannot pay the fire.
QUESTION:
MR. BONNER:
QUESTION:

Right at the time of the sentence?
I am sorry.
Right at the time sentence is imposed.

A judge can look at a wealthy defendant and say, "I fine you
$1*000."

H© can look at an indigent defendant convicted of

the same offense* pleading guilty of the same offense and say*

9
"X know you cannot pay any fine so X am going to sentence
you to ten days in jail."
MR. BCNNERs

£es, sir* that would be perfectly

appropriate* because obviously if we did anything else* we
would immunise Jackie Hunter possibly from any punishment.

And

that is not our claim.
QUESTION3

Would not the record have to show also

some finding or some consideration of whether she could pay
it in installments?
MR. BONNER;
involve that.

Well* I suppose a proper inquiry would

If the judge is thinking in terms of a fine at

all as a precondition or condition of probation or anything*
it would b© common sensa —
QUESTION %
fine.

What if he says* "X am thinking of a $500

Can you pay it?"

She says* "No* I have not got $500*

but X am quite willing to try to work it out."

And 'he says*

"Well* if you cannot pay it* go to jail."
MR. BONNERs
have here.

X think you have/got the same case we

We have an ©qual protection problem.»
Now* /our Honor* we have that particular kind of ease

here.

X mean* wa would have that particular kind of case in

the hypothetical you gave simply because in that case as in
this ease* based on that colloquy* we would have the poverty
factor* the preconditioned payment* isolated and highlighted
as the sole feature on which liberty or not turns.

That is the

10
unique feature of this ease,,

St is not going to exist in a

normal ease.
In a normal ease when a judge is passing sentence —
and incidentally I want to stress tco that we are not making
any suggestion at all that the judge should not consider or
should not be aware of economic status.

It is our position

that the more h© knows about that defendant, the wiser and
better his judgment es;n be,

But he has got to treat that fast,

like race, as Justice Jackson said in Edwards versus California
as a neutral fact, ones that is neither the sours© of rights
nor basis for -QUESTIONS

Mr, Bonner* I do not understand how you

can give the answers you did to both Mr, Justice Whits and
Mr, Justice Rehnquist,

With respect to Mr, Justice White, I

thought you said that if she cams in and said — it will be
$300 and she said I think I can pay it, but than it turns out
she cannott he cannot put her in prison,,

Is that not what you

said?
MR, BONNERs

She would hava the same equal protection

claim, y@s„ sir,
QUESTIONj

But then t© Mr, Jystic© Rehnquist.you said

if you had one rich defendant v?ho could pay $1,000 and a poor
defendant who cannot pay anything, ha — I do not understand
the difference,
MR, BQNNERs

Well* you are hitting — if a judge is

11
faced with two comparably situated co-defendants, one is rich
and one is poor, there is no requirement that he impose the
same sentence„

As a matter of fact, in all probability —

QUESTION;

But the only reason the poor one goes to

jail is she cannot raise any money.
MR. BONNER)!
of —

Well, her® we are getting into a question

it is a different question here.

The judge may very

well decide that $1,000 fine will be sufficient to punish the
relatively affluent defendant.

He may decide that a fine?

you know, the poor co-defendant who can pay no fine should also
foa punished but, obviously, perhaps there are difficulties
in punishing through a fin® — or him through a fin® and,
therefore, he could impose a terra — obviously, if it is ten
days, it is a very simple question.
QUESTIONi

This case is very simple.

The only

reason the person goes to prison is because the person is
an indigent.
MR. BONNER:

I think that illustrates how poverty

has to ba — how if; ca.n he considered, how it has to be coneidered in molding whatever the appropriate punishment is.
QUESTION;'

Well, is not just what the judge did here?

He said if you can raise $165, you gat probation? if you cannot,
you go to jail.
MR. BONNER:
QUESTXON:

Well ~
Suppose the judge to both parties said

12
$1,000 or 1,000 days, and one of them is Mr. Onassis who just
died and the other is a sharecropper?

/ou do not have any

problem?
MR. BONNER:

Ho, sir.

Obviously, you have got the

same problem that we have got here, I think.
QUESTION:
MR. BONNER:

So you do have a problem?
But what you are talking —

talking about a question of degrees.

we are

I think in the hypothe­

tice1.! that you posed we have a judge who is looking at the
co-defendants,.

He wants to punish them, say, comparably.

And

I do not think anybody can eonse in and claim, MHey, wait a
minute now, a real comparabis punishment would have been to
lock him up for ona day and not ten or for two years."

X mean,

you get into a question where you are quibbling with considera­
tions that only a trial judge can make.
Now again any time — the problem with posing
hypotheticaIs is is that any hypothetical you give, it is easy
to isolate an economic factor in a way that similar — to the
way it is isolated here.
QUESTION:
two people equally,.
MR. BONNER:

But here h© obviously tried to treat these
I do not know how it could be more plain.
Well, in a way ha did, but again the

$1,000 fine for Onassis and —
QUESTIONs

Well, let us keep it to the 165 then.

If you can ever put a person in jail because of indigence and

13
that is the only reason,, why can you not do it here?

That is

really the heart of the case and I do not quite understand.
MR. BONNER;

Well, no, four Honor, I am not saying —

I did not mean to suggest that you could ever

I suppose we

get bask to Justice Rehnquist3s question.
QUESTION;
MR. BONNER;

fes, you do.
There my be a point when she is exposed

to jail because of her indigency — you know, talking about
not the gray area bvit the black and white area where she
willfully fails to get a job and make the payments,,
QUESTION;;
willful.

Well, let «3 assume it is always non­

Let us put willful cases all to one side -- just

the inability to pay, can that ever justify a jail sentence?
I think you said yes.
MR. BONNER:

fes, sir, it can, if it is treated as

e. neutral fast and if it goes ~
QUESTIONS

Was it not treated as a neutral fact

hers?
MR. BONNER:

No, sir, it was not.

Indigency was

made the sole condition on which her going to jail and staying
free turned.
QUESTION?

Well, if it can be an ingredient, then

inevitably it eaa sometimes be the controlling condition?
MR. BONNER:

fes, sir, X think sometimes it can be,

but in a normal ease we will never know, because in a normal

14
case or whatever judgment is passed, it is going to be weighed
and balanced against a multitude of factors and we will never
be able to go into that»

Even the question of proof aside, we

would never be able to go into that and say this man got this
particular sentence because he was black or poor or rich or
had blue eyes* something like that»

QUESTIONs

v?s»l51: «since we are dee ling with hypo-

t^nticais, and you have just mentioned the rich, suppose the
ji’dge has a man before him who is a multimillionaire and at the
end of the evidence he finds him guilty and says, "I observe
that you have been found guilty now for the third time, driving
while intoxicated, endangering people9 a lives and each time
we have increased the fine.
to you.

Very clearly fines are no deterrent

/©is cannot be punished by fines because you have so

much money.''1

And he puts all of this on the record.
am going to send you to jail for 30 days.'1

Now

the decision there is because he is so rich —
MR. BONNER:

/63, sir.

Lo you find something wrong with that?

QUESTION *;
MR. BONNER:

No, sir.

That obviously is a common

situation and there is something quit® right with that.

What

is right with that is that the judge has used that economic
factor rationally.

Obviously, it is vary rational in the

hypothetical you gave.
the use of it her®

That is the problem essentially with

15
The State justifies the use of this exclusion for
poverty -- for one, well, basically, for a multitude of reasons.
They say this reflects the family support? it reflects their
control? it reflects an ability to live without creating further
offenses,
That is where the argument basically fails against
the traditional test of showing a rational connection.

They

have used — they have taken the fine and they have used it
hare as a blunderbuss.

Instead of making the specific inquiries

in what control is the family going to offer, what kind of
support are they going to give, is she going to be able to live
a life without crime, they have taken one factor, whether she
can pay a certain fine period end they have used it as a
substitute — as a vary crude and clumsy substitute for these
things that ought to ba precise, careful evaluations,
QUESTION:

What if the judge had determined that this

person could not have paid any fine in Installments or otherwise
and faced right up to Lt that the person is .really indigent and
could not pay as hard as she tried —she is just disabled,
example — and said, therefore, two years in jail.

for

You would

still fee here, would you not?
MR, BONNER;
QUESTION:
MR, BONNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir, we would not be here,
Well, why would you not?
Well —
Why would you not have required the judge

16
to say instead of an automatic
MR. BONNER:

two years —

We would have no way of saying that two-

year sentence was not an appropriate punishment.

We would have

no launching pad here, you know, to bring us here.
X think in what you outlined, we would have a case
where the judge would probably exercise his discretion.

Now

again maybe fundamentally we would have somebody who was in
jail because of the neutral fact that they cannot pay or they
cannot be punished any other way, but we cannot launch ourselves
into this — we should not launch ourselves into this inquiry
into what role all this played and how it is going to fit in
with, say, her prior record and this kind of thing.
On the face of it that would look like: an appropriate
sentence, we would have no claim.

Now again that illustrates

the problem with a hypothetical.

When you give a hypothetical,

it is very neat and simple to say —- to isolate that economic
factor on through.

And I think any time you have got that, then

the position, that X am taking is somewhat contradictory.
QUESTION:

No part of your argument is that there is

hardly any relationship between two years in jail and $165 in
terms it is serving the State’s penalogical interests.

MR. BONNER:
QUESTION:
MR,, BONNER:
argument

Yes, X think here what we have got —
Well, are you arguing that or not?
I am sorry.

No.

It is not a relativity

I admit we would have difficulty on. cur habeas hearing

17
the judge had come back and said,

"Okay.

Well,

if you cannot

pay a fine, I sentence you to one year and eleven months" or
something like that.

We cam run into some problems at that

part i cul ar ext rente.
The critical thing here, what we are talking about —
you know, it is a very modest modification of that particular
requirement in order to give this defendant the choice that is
open to an affluent co-defendant under the same sort of sen­
tence.
And again I want to stress that we are not saying
that the judge should oe blind to economic condition any more
than he should be blind to the color of the man who stands in
front of him or the sex of the person who stands in front of
him.

These are things that the judge is going to know.
QUESTION;

One second.

The question I started with

about the proviso in the statute about money being paid back.
MR. BONNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You said it is not normally the case that

the fine is refundable.
MR. BONNER:

Is it ever the case in your case?
As far as I know, Your Honor, that

statute controls and it is never refundable.
QUESTION:

The proviso is just really meaningless then,

is it not?
MR. BONNER;
paid in, it sticks.

Well, it means that once the money is

18

You could serve fcvro years less one day and if you
paid the whole fine —
QUESTION:

But the proviso is it will not be revoked

if probation is — I mean, it will not be refunded if probation
is revoked, which gives rise to the suggestion that it would
be refunded if probation was not revoked.
MR. BONNER;
QUESTION;

That is not simply —
The inference is not — the fact is other­

wise .
MR. BONNER;
QUESTION;

If you browse through the Georgia Code
The other possibility is that they were

just saying that we can punish you not only by <i fine but by
imprisonment because the inference might be that you can only
be fined or imprisoned.

If I break probation and am sent to

jail, I should get my money back.
MR. BONNER;

Yes.

I think it i! to head off that

argument exactly, but as far as I know, none of that money is
ever refunded.

If the State of Georgia gets it, it has got it.

Now this does point a disparity, I suppose, between
the affluent man who pays his money right away and then stands
two years of risking losing it all than somebody who is on an
installment payment who might only lose part of it.
is a de minimus disparity and I think, you know,

I think that

to countervail

against the man who is able to pay all the fine at one point
has that one condition that he dess not have to worry about

19

throughout his probation? the indigent on the installment

program, although he may end up saviEig money that ha does not
have, you know, by not paying it because he is locked up, none­
theless has to suffer under that condition.
As I say the basic point I just wanted to make is
that w® fully agree that any kind of decision to probate — and
this is part of the State’s argument — is necessarily a
delicate one and one that should be taken with great care.

Our

point is that when it is made to turn solely upon poverty on a
financial consideration, then it simply is not rational.
kind of judgment is again a blunderbuss.

That

It is no substitute

for the kind of evaluations that the State claims that it
stands for.
Here, for example, if the judge had decided that
Jackie Hunter should not be on probation because her family was
going to provide a negative influence on her, you know, maybe
the poverty of the family and so forth would play some role in
all that and he had not put her on probation, we would not have
a case.
I mean there again the judge would have made a
specific evaluation — a specific judgment and we could not
impeach it? we could not get beyond it, even though, you know,
poverty may have played some particular role in it in an
unhypothetical way.
Once we get into e, hypothetical situation, then we are

20
exactly where we are here because we can take that one factor
and we can track it all the way down and we can play with it
and see how it may have been used rationally.
But in a normal case we are not going to have that
particular opportunity.

We are going to have to presume that

whatever weight the judge gave to it was a proper weight, like
race.

Certainly any judge who can sue is going to be aware of

the race of the defendant in front of him and that might mean
something in some context.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bonner, if you prevail here, it is

likely that Georgia will enact restrictive legislation and
)

call for mandatory prison sentences?
MR. BONNER:

Thei"e has been some movement in that

direction, Your Honor, but I do not think that is any chance
at all.

I might say here as a practical matter that not all

probated sentences pass this way or are enforced this way.

And

a great majority of them that have fine conditions accommodate
that particular problem, particularly in the Atlanta Metropo­
litan area and some of the other metropolitan areas, but I am
not sure whether they do this — you know, I am not sure just
whether they are operating under that -QUESTION:

Well, sometimes one can win a case and lose

a lot more in the long run.
MR. BONNER:

I do not believe here, Your Honor, that

there is a risk of that.

What we are asking for is a slight

21

accommodation of that sentence, a very modest accommodation of
that sentence — modification of that sentence and one that
in practical matters is qr.ite commonly —
QUESTION;

What are you asking for?

MR. BONNER:

We are asking basically, Your Honor, that

she be given an opportunity to pay that fine in installments,
in reasonable installments.

And we would have no objection too

if the State wanted to — there is no reason why the install­
ments should stretch over the entire 24-month period either.

It

is all a question of what is reasonable, but we have no objection
if she is required to pay them off relatively early in the
probation.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that we can at this stage

determine the terms of —
MR. BONNER:

No, sir.

This again is something that

a trial judge, you know, would have to look at.

Obviously, he

is going to have to evaluate her employment potential, the
job market possibly in the area, a variety of things like

this

and determine what is reasonable.
QUESTION:

Is there any theoretical difference between

paying it at once or paying it in installments as far as the
legal theory is concerned?
MR. BONNER:

You mean the penalogical theory or

something?
QUESTIONs

Well, the legal theory.

22
MR. BONNER:
as a penalty.

I see no problem with the fine at all

You know, 1 think the only problem here is that

indigency has to be accommodated when a judge in the name of
the state decides that a money payment and probation will satis­
fy the penological interest of the state.
But I do not see -— I think Justice Harlan's concurring
opinion in Williams made the point that the effect of a fine
is liable to be its pinch on the purse rather than the manner
in which it is collected.
that.

And I do not see any problem with

If I have any time left, I will try to save it.
QUESTION:

Let me ask one more question.

I am sorry.

In your habeas corpus petition did you tender an amount that
you said your client cauld pay or did you ask for release?
MR. BONNER:

Your Honor, I did not draft that

petition, but I think the prayer was for release outright.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to in­

dicate that your client could pay §25 immediately?
MR, BONNER;

No, sir.

The Incmlry never got into that

final stags because what had happened in this particular case
is that the court basically adjudicated on the basis of the
prior decisions in the State Supreme Court on just the naked
legal issue.

That was the Calhoun and the Barnett case.

The hearing was really -- if you call it a hearing,
it is sort of in quotation marks because there was no evidence
taken? there was no proffer of anything like that.

It was a

23
summary type of thing, more legal, argument.
Let me save the balance of my time if I have any.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Parker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. STEPHEN PARKER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PARKER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

court:
The overriding issue in this case is whether or not
it is constitutional for a state trial judge to condition pro­
bation upon pre-payment of a fine where the defendant represents
to the court that ha or she is able to pay a fire, but sub­
sequently is unable to pay the fine and for that reason is
not allowed to serve the sentence on probation but rather is
incarcerated.
An underlying issue is whether or not trial judges
should be able in the exercise of their vast, although not
unlimited, discretion'to consider the financial resources
available to a defendant in determining whether or not he is
a good risk for probation»
The petitioner in this case appeared In the Superior
Court of Terrell County Decomber 1976 after having been indicted
with one other person for a residential burglary.

As Mr.

Bonner has recited, the pleas of guilty were entered at that
point.

The trial judge; turned his attention to the question

of what an appropriate sentence woiild be.

24
Upon inquiry, petitioner responded affirmatively that
she would be able to pay a fine and that a cousin would be
probably called upon to help her with that.

The trial court

then posed a two-year probated sentence or two year sentence
on each defendant to be probated upon the condition that each
of them pay a fine of $165 plus court; costs»
Subsequently, the additional portion of that — the
money for the attorneys' fees was stricken with the trial court
after the habeas corpus hearing»

The co-defendant was able to

pay his fine and released; the petitioner, however, did not
pay her fine and remained incarcerated.

She had been on a

personal recognizance bond for the duration of this habeas
corpus proceeding.
In the petition for habeas corpus which was filed
in the Superior Court of Terrell County there was a hearing held
at ttfhich there was no evidence introduced other than the
transcripts of the prior proceedings,

Now at that hearing

and I would like to point out to the Court that the transcript
of that hearing only very recently became available to the

parties and at the time the briefs were filed in this case that
transcript was not In fact available.
But what that transcript does reflect is that at that .
nearing there was an assertion by her attorney that he believed
that she could pay the fine in installments.
no testimony by petitioner in this regard.

There was, however,
He did not avail

25
himself of the possibility of calling her as a witness in this
habeas corpus proceeding, which, of course, could have been
done under the Georgia habeas corpus statute.
QUESTIONS

I missed what you just said.

He did not

avail himself of —
MR„ PARKER;

In other words, Your Honor, the attorney

— a different attorney who represented her at the habeas corpus
hearing could have put her up there on the stand and have her
testify —
QUESTION:

But instead just relied on the record in

the trial court?
MR. PARKER;
the law.

Yes, sir.

He just more or less argued

He maintained that he believed that she could pay

a fine in installments, but there were no specifics and she
offered no testimony.
X also would point out at this habeas corpus hearing
that the State stipulated that she was an indigent at that point
in time.
To the extent that we did not have that transcript,
there is an error in footnote 4 of our brief which states that
the installment issue was not raised until appeal.

Qur brief

was in error on that one point.
QUESTION:
not pay it?

How did the point get up that she could

You said there was no testimony.

MR. PARKER:

Well, she remained incarcerated as a

26

resuit of her failure to pay and then at the hearing the
attorney who represented her at that time advised the court
that she could not pay.

And that is when he also advised the

court of his belief that he thought she could pay on the install­
ment payments.
QUESTION:

And under Georgia law at that stage the

judge could have altered the sentence?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir, he could have.

Under Georgia

law the judge who imposes the probated sentence maintains con­
trol over that sentence for the term of probation.

Otherwise,

he would lose. it at the end of the term of court.,
Now we have not disputed petitioner's assertion that
the equal protection clause applies to judicial action as well
a& legislative ones.

However, I believe it is important to

point out this distinction and to point out the fact that the
basic statutory scheme which authorised the sentence in this
case has net been challenged at any time by the petition.
This court in this case today is not reviewing the
application of a statute challenges unconstitutional, but instead
is being asked to declare unconstitutional an act of individual
judicial discretion in sentencing.
QUESTION:

Do you understand this attack by your

brother to be solely under the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, not under the clue process clause?
MR. PARKER:

I understand it that way, Your Honor

21
QUESTIONS

Perhaps you should be the one to-tell us,

but that is my understanding too,.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir. Our understanding is the equal

protection clause and nothing more.
QUESTION?

Mr. Parker, does Tate versus Short have

any relevance to her problem?
Your Honor, it certainly has relevance,

MR. PARKER:

but we certainly believe as to th© Georgia Supreme Court that
the facts of that case distinguish it primarily because -—
QUESTION:
statute, did w® not?

Well, I think there we have a Teras
We had an attack on a statute.

MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir, in both that case and also

Williams versus Illinois there were statutory provisions in
question which authorised the specific sentence in that case.
And as I stated in this case vie do not have a challenge:
to the statuts, but rather just to the judge's action in
conditioning probation upon pro-payment of the fine.
As we noted in our brief, and 1 will not belabor the
point, the decisions of this court have not treated indigence
as a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis
in each and every case.

For this reason we contend that even

though this case arises in the criminal justice system that the
test of strict scrutiny is not the applicable test but rather
the rational basis test is the applicable test.
The question is whether there is a rational basis for

28

a trial judge to consider a defendant's economic status in
determining whether he is a risk for probation.
Recent decisions of the court have underscored this
point in cases such as the San Antonio School District case,
more recently the abortion case in Maher versus Roe. These
decisions all involved legislative or administrative classifica­
tions but they did make clear that the mere fact that the
impact of a challenged statute or regulation does fall most
heavily upon the indigent is not sufficient to constitute
discrimination against a suspect class.
Now the petitioner contends that there is a distinction
between cases involving public funding of schools., welfare
and related programs and between cases arising under the
criminal justice system, such as this case.
support for that argument»

There is some

The footnote in the Maher versus

Roe opinion indicating that the principles of Griffin versus
Illinois have not been applied to legislative classifications
generally.
But I would also point out to the court that there
are contrary indications such as the language in the San Antonio
School District ca3a in which the very cases of Tate versus
Short and Williams versus Illinois were discussed at some
length by the court in the majority opinion, and the opinion
that flatly stated that although judges often do consider a
defendant’s ability to pay a fine and imposing a fine —

29

QUESTION s
MR. PARKER;

Why does Georgia provide legal aid?
Well, Your Honor, Georgia provides legal

aid in order to provide the assistance of counsel at trial —
QUESTION:

You recognise that there is a group that

needs it?
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir, there is a recognition of that

need.
The discussion of the Tate case and of the Williams
case which is contained in the Scin Antonio opinion pointed out
or stated in dicta admittedly that in imposing fines judges are
guided by sound judicial discretion rather than constitutional
mandates„
There are, in fact, a number of cases within the
criminal justice system in which this court has refused to
apply a strict scrutiny test in an equal protection analysis.
For example, in the Ross versus Moffitt, the Court's 1974
decision in which it was held that the equal protection clause
nor the due process clause --- neither of th©m required the
stats to appoint counsel for indigence on discretionary appeal
after direct appeals had bsem exhausted.

There was reference

in that case to the other decisions outside the criminal law
area in which indigence had not been considered a suspect class.
I would submit that Ross versus Moffitt is a recog­
nition by this Court that it is not possible to have absolute
equality within the criminal justice system.

There are other

30
cases»

For example, the Court rejected an equal protection

challenge in a case involving a Mew York statute setting parole
eligibility and clearly favoring those who had been --or
discriminated against those who had been unable to make bond
prior to their trials»

An equal protection argument was

summarily rejected in that case, McGinnis versus? Royster»
I would also point out that an examination of a case
such as Griffin versus Illinois and its progeny reveals that
the court had in fact invalidated statutes and practices in
which it placed the indigent at a disadvantage in the criminal
justice system for no rational reason»

The lack of a rational

reason, I submit, is a compelling factor in all of those cases»
For example, in the Griffin case the courts found,
and I think very directly, that there is no rational relation­
ship between the defendant’s ability to pay costs for an appeal
in advance and Ms guilt or innocence.

There just could not

be any relationship and for that reason and others the Illinois
requirement was struck down, the irrationality simply being
the fact that the merits of a post-trial motion is in no way
related to a defendant's financial status.
QUESTIONs

I taka it your submission is that 30 days

or $30 is always a good sentence, and if the indigent — and if
a person is indigent and cannot pay the $30, 30 days is always
valid?
MR» PARKER;

No, sir, that is not our position at all.

31
QUESTIONs

What is it?

MR. PARKER?

You have not said yet,

Well, our position, Your Honor, is that

it is permissible for a judge to impose probation and to provide
as a condition of that probation that a fine be paid,
QUESTION?

In a lump sura?

MR. PARKER:
QUESTION?

In a lump sum.
So that you either pay in a lump sum or

you have the specified time in jail?
QUESTION?

Regardless of the amount?

MR. PARKER?

Well, Your Honor, there certainly are

limitations on v/hat a judge can do.

In fact, the Georgia

Supreme Court's opinion -QUESTION?

Well th© statutory limitations in Georgia

obviously?
MR. PARKER?

Yes, sir, and due process limitations
?

as set forth by -QUESTION:

Well here it was within the statutory —

MR. PARKER?

Yes, Your Honor.

Th© judge could have

fined her up to $2,000.
QUESTION:
MR, PARKER?

And the jail?
Well the statute which provides that

a fin© may ba imposed as a condition of probation provides that
th© fine can be up to $2,000.
QUESTION?
MR, PARKER?

If probation is revoked, then what happens?
If probation is revoked, then the

32
defendant would get credit for the time spent on probation.
QUESTION?

I know, but what is the jail sentence

under Georgia law for this case?
*

QUESTION?
MR. PARKERs

What was it in this case?
Two years.

The crime for which she was

indicted carried a on© to 20 year sentence.

In this case she

received a two-year probated sentence.
QUESTION?

Right.

So it was well within the statutory

limits of the jail sentence?
MR. PARKER?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And you ifould say that the judge could say

to the defendant either pay the fine.

You have violated probation.

Now either pay the fine in a lump sum or go to jail.

And the

defendant says, “I just cannot pay it in a lump sum."
MR. PARKER %

Well, at that point. Your Honor, I

think it is -QUESTION?
MR. PARKER?

I can pay it in installments.
At that point, I think it is a matter

for the court1s discretion.
QUESTION:

But it would not violate the constitution,

you say, if the judge said awfully sorry, but either lump sum
or nothing?
MR. PARKER?

Wq contend that it does not violate the

constitution for the judge in the exercise of his sentence and
discretion to impose a lump sum payment upon an individual and

33
to condition their probation upon them being able to pay their
fine o
QUESTIONS

Could the judge have sentenced her, say,

to the 20 years period?
MR, PARKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Tha plea of guilty

was to the crime of burglary and the crimes does carry a sen­
tence from one to 20 years in this case.
I would like to use the balance of my time for our
basic arguments about .sentencing, 'discretioni and, hopefully,
cover soma of your questions, Justice White, of what our position
is with regards to what the judge can or should be able to do.
Let me just first state three basic propositions
which we are advocating with regard to the judge's sentencing
discretion.

i

First of all, we contend that it is not constitu­
tionally required — it should not b© required to — the court
should not be prohibited from considering a defendant's financial
status and all other relevant factors in determining whether
he or she is a good risk for probation.
Secondly, we contend that the trial judge in assessing
the sentence or determining what appropriate terms of probation
would be should b© allowed to rely upon the defendant's
assertion that he or she will be able to pay a fine.

Now, in

this case X would point, out that the defendant was represented
by appointed counsel, and there is no challenge to counsel's

34

competence and no challenge to the voluntariness? of the guilty
plea.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Well, he did not say she could pay.
No, Your Honor, she said she could pay?

he did.
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

Well, where did she say it?
Well she did not say it in responses

to the amount that was given but she said she could pay a fin®
without responding to the amount.

And there is no indication

that counsel was derelicting his duty.
QUESTION:

She said she thought her cousins would.

MR. PARKER: Yes, sir,
QUESTION:

Sh© said she —

That is a lot of difference in saying I

will pay, unless she has got cousins that are different from
ray cousins.
QUESTION:
could pay.

-art:.—~

Did she not say categorically, yes, she

And than whete th© judge took a further step, the

judge said hew are you going to pay it and then she said my
cousins will pay it.
MR. PARKER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

judge did not simply rely on her assertion that she could pay.
He asked her how sh® could pay.
QUESTION:

You do not know what the judge relied on,

do you?
MR. PARKER:

No, sir.

I only know what is in the

35
record,
QUESTIONS

Wall, quote to me, what did he say in the

record that he relied on that?
MR, PARKER:

To be verbatim, he said:

how can you pay a fine?"

“Jacquelyn,

And at that point, she responded with

the statement.
QUESTION:

No,

The statement was you said relying

on that.
MR. PARKER:
QUESTION:

I apologize for any presumption.
You can assume that;.

You can assume ha

relied on it, but you do not know.
MR. PARKER:

Yes, sir, that is true.

But the point

that I was trying to make was that where a defendant is
represented by counsel and indicates to the court after having
been advised by counsel and after having entered, a plea of
guilty that she can in fact pay a fine, than it should also
point out that there was no effort made to withdraw the guilty
plea at that time .— at least the record reflects no complaint
of any type, the value of the sentence or the fine or any other
aspect of the case.
Our position as to allow the sentencing court to
consider all pertinent factors is very consistent with what
this court has decided in numerous eases such as Williams versus
New York, a 1949 case in which the court stated emphatically
that under the modem philosophy of penology, the punishment

36

Is supposed to fit th© offender and not merely the crime.

Nov/

the rationale of that decision was recently reiterated by the
court in the decision handed down on June 26th of this year
after the filing of our briefs, United States versus Grayson,
in whleh the majority of this court held that — upheld the
action of a federal trial judge v/ho had stated on the record
that he had given a particular defendant a longer sentence
because of his personal belief that the defendant had lied on
the stand while testifying on his own behalf.
The Grayson court concluded that the defendant's
truthfulness or mendacity was relevant to his prospects of
rehabilitation

s a reflection of his attitude towards the

cite.
The facts ara obviously quite differant, but we
submit that under the rationale of Grayson and similar cases
that to allow a sentencing judge to consider, along with manyother factors, the financial resources available to a defendant
in the event he has sentenced a probation as constitutional and
is in fact desirable.
Now we do point out in our brief that in probably
the majority of casas would not even be a germane factor.

And

seme cases, very sarioas crimes, would not fo@ any factor at
all to consider, but nevertheless the courts should not be
deprived of the opportunity to recognize that someone is perhaps
a bettor risk for probation because of their ability to pay a _

37
fine into the court, under such circumstances as th© court
dictates.
To ignore the factor would in fact be to ignore
reality and I believe an example of th© reality of that is that
sine© 1945 the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided
that a pre-sentence investigation shall contain information
about a defendant's financial condition, along with the many
other factors.
The decision to grant probation is, in fact, as
difficult or perhaps more difficu.lt than a decision of what
number of years to give one who is going to be incarcerated
has great, consequences for the defendant, obviously, and also
for society.

We submit that the trial judge should not be

encumbered in carrying out this very difficult function.
QUESTION:

Did you say earlier that the petitioner

here is actually out on her own recognisance during the pendency
of the proceeding?
MR. PARKERs

Yes, sir.

She was granted a personal

recognisance bond of soma type by the U. S. District Courts
of the Middle District of Georgia, and I believe that occurred
after a federal habeas petition was filed.

The petition was

held in abeyance pending exhaustion of state remedies, but she
was out on this —
QUESTION:
MR. PARKER:

So she is still out right now then?
Yes, sir, as far as I know, she is

38
QUESTION?

How much time had she served before she

was released on this personal recognizance?
MR. PARKER;

The guilty plea was entered on December

13th? the habeas corpus hearing was on February —
QUESTION:

What year was that?

MR. PARKER;

I am sorry, 1970.

She had served about

two months when the habeas petition was brought.,

I would say

she probably served about three months because 2 do not know
when the federal habeas petition was filed.
QUESTION;

So this is affirmed that she will now have

to go back to serve the 21 months?
MR. PARKER:

Well, she would have to serve the balance

of her sentence, I believe.
QUESTION;

Well that would b© 21 months, would it not?

MR. PARKER:

Well, yes, sir, whatever she had not

served.
QUESTION:

Well I thought you had said she served

three months?
MR. PARKER:

I am sorry.

She would have to serve

whatever — she would get credit for whatever she had served,
but I do not believe that under the Georgia statute she would
get credit for the time on the personal recognisance bond
pending the proceeding.
Therefore, sh© would probably serve about ten or
eleven more months and that sh© would — of a two-year sentence

39
she would probably serve about 14 mouths of it, right.
But one more point that I would like to make about
the sentence itself is that there is no reason for the court
to feal that it was unreasonable when ha imposed the penalties
which could have been inflicted for the crime, coupled with the
statements by the defendant as to what she would ha able to do,
and coupled with the fact that it really was a fairly modest
fine.

All of these factors make the court's action look

reasonable and certainly does not appear to have been an abuse
of the trial judge's discretion in that regard,
QUESTION:

One other small question:

If during this

period that the case had been going on she was able to earn
$.165 and save it and she tendered it to the State judge at this
stags, I suppose she would get probation, would she not?
MR, PARKER:

I would say in practice, Your Honor,

X think that would b© the case,

she would,

I do not know if

it would ba required as a matter of law that I personally know
of cases where that very thing happens,
QUESTION:
MR, PARKER:

Has any tender been made?
As far as I know, Your Honor, none

whatsoever,
In conclusion, I would like to make two or three
points as to what we feel would be the practical, consequences
of a reversal of the Georgia Suprema Court's decision — at
.Least, any reversal on the merits.

40

First of all,

I think that it is fair to say that

there will be at least a certain number of persons who will be
incarcerated rather than having been given an opportunity to
pay a fine.

I think Justice Blackman1 s concurrent opinion in

the Tate versus Short case implied this and 1 think that would
be the case if trial judges were to corae to the conclusion
that it really was not .safe to fine .‘anybody because at some
point in time then he or she could come back in and say they
were not abla to pay it.
I think that that would probably lead to a greater
number of sentences of incarceration and that would obviously
not be in the interest ©f the state or the defendants.

It

would have possible implications in ofcbesr areas such as the
trend toward restitution in criminal sentencing,-

Restitution

is a type of sentence which is used a good bit down in Georgia
and elsewhere.
And I believe that a reversal of what the Georgia
Supreme Court said in this case could adversely affect that
trend toward restitution as a part of criminal sentences,
In conclusion, we urge affirmance of the Georgia
Supreme Court's opinion and we contend that reversal of it
would seriously curtail the sentencing discretion of judges,
curtail their Userstion in making the most critical determina­
tions of when probation should be granted to offenders.
We urge affirmance.

Thank you.

41
REBUTTAL OF JAMES C. BONNER, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BONNER;

I just have a couple more remarks.

I

wanted to go back to the record and the original representation
that was made and point something out that I might not have
emphasised enough.

The Chief Justice quoted that excerpt from

it, but I would like to point out that this colloquy with the
defendant was simply can you pay a fine and so forth.
Thera was nothing in that colloquy indicating the
judge wanted that fine in lump sum and not in installments.
QUESTION;

Was there no discussion of the amount of

the fine?
MR. BONNER;

No, sir, there was apparently no dis­

cussion of the amount either.

But basically, there is just

no rationality.
QUESTION?

Do you contend that the sentence was

unconstitutional when it was imposed?
MR., BONNER;

No, sir.

It was unconstitutional when

she remained incarcerated under it for her involuntary inability
to pay.
I {.agreed that it looked perfectly good, and if the
judge had imposed a $5 fine or a $10 fine,there would have bean
no problem, but he did not do that.

Here basically though

there is ao rationality in the sentence.
The State sentence says that it makes her appear to be

42
a better probation risk and that is just simply not true.
QUESTIONS

These arguments would

;ome with much better

shape if there had been some evidence of an effort to tender
or promise to pay the fine over a period of time.
MR. BONNERs

Well, essentially, that is what the

gravamen of the habeas was about. Your Honor.

There was a

discussion of that installment adjustment of the sentence.
Again there was opportunity for that necessarily to
com© up at sentence.

?or all she at sentencing, the family

could have come through with it, but basically, as I say, the
praconditional requirement here has no rational basis to anything'
having to do with probation or not.

The sentence itself reflects

the irrationality of it because she could go out, for example,
and gat that money from a loan shark and that would not auger
well for her chances on probation.
The local procuror could ccme in and give it to her,
but again that would hot indicate either family interest,
family support and it would not indicate that she would be a
good risk for probation.

This is the problem when the fine

is mode to turn solely on this irrational fact which really
does not have anything to do with the fine and delicate cal­
culations that the judge ought to make whan h© assasses whether
or not this defendant can serve her sentence successfully on
probation.
I think that is all I. have to say.

43
QUESTION2

Your only claim is the equal protection

claim, is it not?
MR. BONNER;

Yes, sir.

I think originally the due

process claim was made in the habeas petition and there is no
reason why it could not have been made throughout.
QUESTION:
MR. BONNER:

But you do not make it, do you?
Well, sir, we are dealing — I do not

think there is any need. to.

1 think we are in an area where

due process and equal protection blur.
exactly the same kind of thing here.

We are coming down to
This is an arbitrary

requirement that is excluding her from the benefit of probation.
The argument, I think, -would fly equally as well on
due process.
QUESTION:

But I ara asking what argument you are

And as I understand your brief and now as I think I

understand your answer, you are making an equal protection
argument?
