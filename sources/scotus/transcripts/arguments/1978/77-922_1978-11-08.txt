PRO C E E D I N G S
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments next

in 922 j, Chrysler Corporation against Brown.
Mr. Braverman* I think you may proceed whenever you're
re ady.
ORAL ARGTO1ENT OF BURT A. BRAVERMAN* ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. B:*AVERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Courts
This is what is known cis a reverse Freedom of
Information Act

case.

An action to enjoin certain government

agencies from disclosing documents that are asserted to be
confidential in nature.

The action was brought against the

respondent* Defense Logistics Agency* Department of Labor*
Department of Defense.
The issues in tills cast; concern the extent to which
these agencies are prohibited by federal statutes and
regulations from disclosing confidential business information.
And also the extent to which the petitioner* Chrysler
Corporation * is entitled to a de novo trial.
The case arose as follows:

The respondent agencies

notified Chrysler that two requests for disclosure of
documents had been received and that those requests were made
under the Freedom of Information Act.

They advised Chrysler

that it could object to the disclosure of those documents if

4
it chose»
The documents in this case were of two types»

The

first called an affirmative action program, or an AAP , con­
sisted of several hundred pages of extremely detailed
employment data,

The data, in essence, was a blueprint or

a handbook of the organisation and staffing of Chrysler8s
assembly plants»
The second kind of docvment involved was a government,
report which was prepared concerning a review of those
facilities, and the compliance of those facilities with
various regulations applicable to government contractors»
Those government reports incorporated into them substantial
portions of the data that was included in the affirmative
action programs themselves.
And I want to note at this point that the data
included in Chrysler*s AAP5 s is viewed by Chrysler as
confidential in nature»

It is covered by various written

i

confidentiality policies and practices of the Corporation, and
the Corporation and its employees are expressly restricted
from disclosing that data either to competitors or to the
public.
The respondents permitted written objections to be
filed to disclosure. Chrysler objected on essentially two
bases»

First, it asserted that the information was exempt

from disclosure under Exemption * of the Freedom of Informa-

5
fcion Act. That exemption says that the disclosure mandate of
the Freedom of Information Act shall not apply to information
which is confidential and commercial in nature, or trade
secrets.

And, second, it asserted that disclosure of these

documents was prohibited by the Federal Trade Secrets Act,
18 UoS.C. Section 1905, which makes it a crime for any
federal employee to disclose certain specified types of
confidential business statistical data, such as was contained
in the AAPhs.
The respondents decided the issue against Chrysler
and informed Chrysler that the documents would be disclosed.
Although Chrysler was supposedly afford a right to appeal
administratively from that determination, it was not allowed
to do so because the agency indicated that it would not await
the results of that appeal prior to disclosing the documents.
Consequently, Chrysler, having exhausted its
administrative remedies, was compelled to institute an injunc­
tive action in the District Court, for Delaware.
Following a de novo trial, in which the District
Court heard the testimony of expert witnesses and other
witnesses concerning the nature of the information at issue
and the consequences of disclosure of that information to the
public, the District Court issued its decision, in which it
held that, first, the information was in fact exempt from
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, because it

6

was c;onfidantial in natura# and because its disclosure would
cause substantial competitive injury to Chrysler,

And#

second# it held that disclosure of that information would
violate the Trade Secrets Act as well as certain parallel
provisions of the defendant9s regulations.
Consequently# it enjoined the disclosure of those
portions of the documents which it found to be exempt from
disclosure,
QUESTION:

When you say the Trade Secrets Act#

counsel# you mean 18 U«,S,C, 1905?
MR, BRAVERMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir,

Isn't one of the Black Letter principles

of equity that a court of equity will not enjoin a criminal
act?
MR, BRAVERMAN:

That is correct.

However# it would

be an abuj® of discretion# of course# if the agency were to
exercise its discretion to disclose documents in violation of
that law§ and to prevent that abrss of discretion in an
anticipatory sense, the District Court exercised its equitable
jurisdiction to enjoin the disclcsure.
QUESTION:

The problem —

Well# you're saying then# it just didn't

bother to follow what is known as a Black Letter principle of
equity?
MR, BRAVERMAN:

I believe it did bother to follow it.

It realized that it could not await the disclosure of that

7
information to then remedy the problem» Because once disclosed
the confidential information could never be returned to its
original stata»

And this Court has recognized, in that

aspect, there will be implied a cause of action under certain
statutes where the remedy is necessary where, to effectuate
the purpose c£ the statute and it has applied that principle
in criminal cases»
And, consequently, the District Court did in fact,
I think, consider that equitable principle, but realized that
the information had to be enjoined prior to disclosure»
Again, we were also proceeding under the Freedom of
Information Act, which, we asserted, also provided a basis for
the District Court to enjoin disclosure of the information»
But the basic answer is that the Court found that it
would be ail abusive discretion ard that the APA permitted it
to provide that injunctive remedy»
Cross-appeals were filed from the District Court9s
decision, and the Court of Appeals reversed» The Court of
Appeals held that the District Court had erroneously engaged
in a de novo trial, that Chryslercs cause of action did not
arise under either the FOIA or the Trade Secrets Act, but,
rather, only under the Administrative Procedure Act» And it
also held that the federal agencies had discretion to disclose
these documents, even if they were exempt from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act, and even if they fell

8

within the Trade Secrets Act, if the agencies had some
regulation which authorised that disclosure.
The agency found however — Ism sorry? the Court
of Appeals found, however, that the agency's record that it
had compiled in the course of deciding these issues was so
inadequate as to prevent further review, and it remanded the
case for further proceedings»
This Court has recognised on a number of occasions
that the Freedom of Information Act was brought into existence
to remedy what had been perceived to be an era of secrecy
on the part of government agencies» The object of Congress
was that if it could open the processes of government to
greater public scrutiny, those agencies and the government
itself would become more accountable to the public.
At the same time that it was attempting to end
I

this era of secrecy, however, it was aware that businesses
such as Chrysler submit vast amounts of business information
to federal agencies, both voluntarily and in compliance
with various regulatory requirements»

Now, some of that

information, Congress knew, could be disclosed without harming
the businesses that provided it.

But it was also aware that

significant amounts of that information were of a truly
confidential nature, and that if that information was dis­
closed, that could impair the competitive or other
of the businesses

health.

9

At the time that the Freedom of Information Act was
coining into existence in its early stages , 9 63 and when the
Senate hearings were being conducted, there was no exemption
in the Act for confidential business information,,

And this

omission gave rise to a great hue and cry over the need for
such protection,
Interestingly, the greatest or perhaps the most
vocal proponents of the need to protect business documents
ware the federal agencies themselves.

They cited two principal

reasons for the need for this protection,

First and most

obviously was the need to protect businesses which were,
either pursuant to regulation or in a cooperative effort,
furnishing confidential information to the agencies to protect
these businesses from the harm which could be caused by
disclosure.
And, second, they realized that this protection was
the quid pro quo for the agency's ability to obtain this kind
of information in the future, if the information were not to
be respected in its confidentiality, the business would no
longer furnish that information.
And in reaction to this outcry for the need for
protection, Congress in fact added what is now the fourth
exemption to the Freedom of Information Act,
But Exemption 4 was considerably different than the
other exemptions to the Act,

The other exemptions, for example

10

Exemption 1 or 2 or 5 or 7, dealing with national security
secrets# dealing with investigative files# dealing with inter­
agency memoranda# these exemptions were designed to protect
governmental interests®

They were designed to give the

agency the option# if it needed to# to withhold certain
documents from disclosure because governmental interests
might truly be impaired»
But as to these exemptions# Congress still made
them permissive only.

Whan I say permissive# it gave the

agencies discretion to withhold those documents if it needed
to# but it made clear in the legislative history that those
exemptions were not to be invoked unless it was truly
necessary to protect the governmental interest®
QUESTIONi Which legislative history are you talking
about# the Senate or the House?
MR® BRAVERMAN:

This comes through# in fact# in

both the Senate and the House®

It comes through in the

sense that# although there are statements made concerning
the permissive nature of the exemption# the only time that
they are made is with respect to those exemptions relating
to governmental interests®

In contrast# when the Congress

remarked concerning Exemption 4# which was an exemption de­
signed to protect private interests# its statements were in
the sense of mandatory remarks that the exemption

must be

enforced and must be utilized to protect those private

11
interests,
QUESTIONi

This is committee reports?

MR® BRAVERMANs

Thase ere in the Committee reports 0

For example, in House Report 1497, the House stated that
Exemption 4, and I quote, "would assure the confidentiality
of confidential business information obtained by the
government®"
And during the Senate hearings, the statement was
made, "Such protection must be afforded not only as a matter
of fairness but”, again I quote, "as a matter of right®"
Congressman —
QUESTIONS

Well, I've always had the feeling that

the House report was written by the proponents and the Senate
report was written by the opponents, or vice versa®

I find

t

those reports quite contradictory®
MR® BRAVERMAN:

They obviously have their

proponents and their opponents®

The House report, in fact,

was somewhat more liberal in tents of the protection to be
afforded®
But what I’m trying to make clear is that both the
House and Senate indicate that the need was there to protect
coniridential business information®

In fact, even Attorney

General Ramsey Clark, after the Act was enacted, made the
statement that confidential business information must be
protected from disclosure and must remain outside the zone of

12
accessibility.
QUESTION?

Mra Bravermen, I wonder if your argument

really advances your cause, because the statutory language is
the same, is it not? in terms of whether it's permissive or
mandatory, for all six exemptions, or for all seven exemptions,
rather, -MR. BRAVERMANs
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

-- and if you are conceding, in effect,

that 1, 2, 5 and 7 are permissive, and the statute used the
same language for 3, 4 and 6, maybe you've put yourself in a
hole«
MR. BRAVERMANs

No, I don't believe so. The Act

says that "Where information falls within an exemption, the
Act shall not apply."

That's clear.

‘Hiat is the statutory

language.
But, as the Court of Appeals noted in the
Westinghouse case, the legislative history reflected so clear,
so clear a purpose to protect that information and to continue
the practice that had previously existed in government of
protecting confidential business information, that this
legislative, these remarks from which I've quoted, expressed
an affirmation, a mandate that this information be protected.
It was not simply to be somefchincf that the government agency
had Idle discretion either to adhere to or not to adhere to.
Now, in this case, for example, the government takes

13
the position that even where information falls within the
fourth exemption, even where that information is confidential,
even where that information would cause substantial competitive
injury if disclosed, the agency still has discretion to
disclose that information.
We think Congress intended otherwise and intended to
provide protection to that information.
Furthermore, this statute can be read in tandem with
the Trade Secrets Act,
QUESTION:

If Exemption 4 was added later, how do

you explain the failure to use different language?
MR, BRAVERMAN:

Exemption 4 was added in response

to the need to protect the information.

If you read the

legislative history, it shows that there was a concern for a
need for protection. Congress added the exemption in response
to that, its intent, as viewed from the.legislative history,
was to provide that protection.
We think that something more
QUESTION:.

That .ioesr*t really explain why they

used statutory language that had previously been made clear
to have a permissive meaning to accomplish the purpose you
describe.

It's just poor legislative drafting, I take it,
MR, BRAVERMAN:

I think it’s poor legislative

drafting, because I think that they meant something more
than merely ”shall not apply3

t
°

and what has to be done is to

14
be read in the context of what preceded this»

Congress was

attempting to reverse the practice of agency secrecy concerning
agency documentsa

It was not intending to reverse the

practice of agency respect for the confidentiality of business
documents0
As I understand the legislative history, it was
Congress's purpose to allow the agencies to continue that
practice and, in fact, it endorsed the practice of respecting
the confidentiality of the business documentc

Perhaps the

drafting could have been clearer,
There is what we believe to be a mandate for
confidentiality in the Freedom of Information Act*

Yet, in

spite of that mandate, the Court below and the respondents
through their regulations have turned the Act around0

Rather

than providing protection for confidential business informa­
tion through the fourth exemption, and rather than serving as
a vehicle for the public to find out about how the agency
functions, the Act today has become a principal method for
finding out about private business activities, for finding
out about your neighbor or your competitor, or just about
anybody who filas documents in the government,,
Now, let me give you some examples to illustrate my
i-

pointo

The Act has become a very, very frequently used

vehicle for industrial espionage,

The Food and Drug

Administration testified in congressional hearings recently

15
that, of the many thousands of FOIA requests which it receives
annually, 86 percent of those requests come from corporations
or corporate representatives seeking to obtain private data
that has been filed in either applications or similar reports
with that agencyo

The reports of other agencies are the same,

QUESTION? Was there anything in the legislative
history discussing the organisation of groups,business groups,
who simply sought information in the abstract, then classified
it and sold it®

Was that developed in the legislative

history?
MR» BRAVERMAN:

I do net recall anything concerning

that in the legislative history®
QUESTION:

It was developed in some reports, but

I wondered whether it was in this history®
MR® BRAVERMAN:

I do nc-t recall that® There is,

however, reference in the legislative history to the converse
practice of agencies such as the Bureau of the Census and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which acquire information from the
public and aggregate it in such c. way as to maintain its
confidentiality because they recognized it should not be
available.
But there was nothing that I know of in the legis­
lative history on the other point:®
QUESTION:

But it5s true that Congress knew that

this pirating, for lack of another word, between business

16

corporations was going on?
MR* BRAVERMANs
QUESTIONS

They knew that this was •—

This wasn't brand new*

MR* BRAVERMANs

In 967 they knew that this was a

practice that was then conducted by sequestering an employee,
taking a photograph? they did not know —
QUESTIONS

Any way possible*

MR* BRAVERMANs

Any weiy*

But they did not realize

that the Act would be used this way*
QUESTION:

And didn't they realize that this was

going to be a new way?
MR* BRAVERMANs

They didn't realize it because

they intended that the fourth exemption would provide pro­
tection* They did not —
QUESTIONS
you think it is*

Well, that I don't think is as clear as
I think, knowing that, it could have been

much clearer*
MRo BRAVERMANs

Perhaps they should have had more

foresight? we wish they had* But they did not, and today the
Act is being used in that fashior*

Indeed, it is now possible,

through the FOIA to obtain business data which could not be
legitimately obtained under the Federal and State Trade Secret
Laws, Fair Practice Laws, but to obtain that data simply by
sending an FOIA request to your friendly government agency
and saying, "Please give me this application form? please give

17
me the formula described in this reports

And the data is

available»
We think this not only cuts against the careful
fabric of trade secret laws that have been developed over the
years, but we also think it raises very serious questions
about whether government agencies, in disclosing private
data under the Freedom of Information Act to private persons,
whether those agencies are in fact impairing property rights
in contravention of the. Fifth Amendment®
QUESTIONs

But, now, Congress did provide some

protection for the kind of thing you’re talking about®

In our

decision in the Robertson case, for example, where disclosure
is prohibited by some other law, then the agency at the very
least need not disclose it and probably cannot disclose it®
MR® BRAVERMAN:

Absolutely® That is, in fact, another

issue in the case which I was not going to address today, but
I will say that we do contend, although the —
QUESTION?

That’s Exemption 3 you mean?

MR® BRAVERMANs

— the Court did not agree

that’s

right *•*» that Exemption 3 in corpc rates the Trade Secrets Act
into the FOIA in such a way as tc make the Act not applicable
to any information which falls within the Trade Secrets Act®
And that is in issue®
QUESTIONS

But is it jour view that Exemption 3 is

more than just permissive, too?

As you submit Exemption 4 is®

18
MRo BRAVERMAN:
yes.

Exemption 3 is absolutely mandatory ,

That9s our contention.
QUESTIONS

And that neither under — if material

falls under either Exemption 3 or Exemption 4, the agency may
not waive the exemption? is that it?
MR0 BRAVERMANs

That is correct.

Another use, in fact, that has been made of the
QUESTION:

Although you can see the agencies may

waive the other, or at least some of the other exemptions.
MR. BRAVERMAN:

Exactly, because those exemptions

are designed to protect governmental interests.
QUESTION:

Now, is this because of the legislative

history or because of the interest they are designed to protect
or because of thair language or viiat?
MR. BRAVERMAN:

It is because of the interests that

they are designed to protect.

It is because of the history of

Section 1905, the Trade Secrets Act, that the Court has
incorporated through Exemption 3.

It is not only because of

the "shall not apply5* language of the Freedom of Information
Act.
QUESTION:

Mr® Braverman, I'm puzzled by your

reliance on 3, because a condition of coming within 3 is that
some other statute mandate nondisclosure®
MR. BRAVERMAN:
QUESTION s

That’s right, and in this —

So, then, how can 3 be the source of the

19

mandate for nondisclosure, when you don’t even reach that?
MR® BRAVERMAN%

It’s a somewhat circular process®

If the information is prohibited from being disclosed by 1905,
and if, as we assert, 1905 is an Exemption 3 statute, then the
Freedom of Information Act does not apply to that data®

It

cannot authorise its disclosure because that data is specifically exempted from disclosure by 1905®
And so, in that way, the Act is rendered inoperative,
and the information is protected by the Trade Secrets Act®
Now, this perversion of Exemption 4 has also been
used now to circumvent the Federai Rules of Civil Procedure®
A litigant,who could and should seek to acquire information
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a discovery
context, will make a Freedom of Information Act request for
private documents and in that wa^ will circumvent all of the
protection and scrutiny that the court itself could provide
with respect to that discovery request.
In fact, that is the cese with the two requests in
this case.

The two litigants, ir cases involving Chrysler,

desired to obtain information for use in those cases against
Chrysler, but rather than proceeding in those actions, where
Chrysler could have objected on the basis of relevance,
burdensomeness, it instead came through the Freedom of
Information Act and attempted to get that information in
circumvention of the federal rule.®

20

We think this Court has. frowned upon this practice
both in Robbing Tire and NLKB v» Sears * Roebuck * where it
indicated* in an agency context* that the Act should not be
used for this purpose? and ws think that it is equally
abhorrent to use the Act for this purpose against a private
person* particularly where the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure do exist as a means of obtaining this data*
Now* X mention these examples really to show that
the Act no longer is being used to find out about government
operations* bt^t instead is being used to find out about
private activities*

This* unfortunately* is not what the Act

was intended to accomplish.
In allowing these practices* it has the effect of
undermining the fourth exemption* undermining the protection
which that exemption was intended to provide* and of upsetting
the balance that Congress was trying to fashion between the
public5s right to know on the one hand and the business
community's right to be secure ir its property and privacy»
We think that the decision below* by recognizing
tills broad agency discretion* to disclose the very kinds of
documents which Exemption 4 was intended to protect* disrupts
the legislative scheme* is contrary to the legislative history,
and we urge the Court to reverse the decision below,
QUESTION? Before the enactment of the FOIA* Mr,
Braverman* I take it if you had teen defending Chrysler

21

against a private litigant in the United States District
Court, that private litigant would have been free to go to
the Department of Defense and say, "Look we've got a lawsuit,
will you give us some papers that you've got here?”

And the

Department of Defense could have given it to them without the
necessity of going through the compliance with the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure,

The Department of Defense isn’t a

defendant in the private action,
MR, BRAVERMANs

That’s not true, because, at that

point, the Department of Defense would have been prohibited by
the Trade Secrets Act from disclosing that to any person,
QUESTIONS

But if you’re right, they still are,

MR, BRAVERMANs

If we are right, and if the Trade

Secrets Act falls within Exemption 3,
QUESTION s

And in each case the remedy would be a

criminal prosecution,
MR, BRAVERiMANs

Exactly,

Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs, Babcock,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS, BARBARA ALLEN BABCOCK, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MRS, BABCOCXs

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I think at the outset we should put this case in
context.

This is not a strange, new animal on the legal

22
landscape.

The issues here are old and familiar ones.

Whether an agency has abused its discretion or acted contrary
to law in a decision that if raade0

Nothin in or about the

Freedom of Information Act changes the approach that this
Court took a year before the Freedom of Information Act was
passed # in the Federal Communications Commission vs, Schreiber#
381 U.S. 279,
There# this Court upheld the discretion of the FCC
to hold public hearings# against the objections of a private
corporation# much the same as the. objections that are being
made here# that public view of its records would cause
competitive harm and would ruin the American economy.
The authority of the FCC to hold these public
hearings was found in their authorizing statute# which says
that they could conduct proceedings in such a manner as will
best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the
ends of justice.
And this Court found# in that context# that the
decision of the FCC to hold public hearings to expose this
information to the public was completely within its discretion.
We have all# in a way# fallen
QUESTION:

Mrs, Babcock# isn31 it true that in —

we9re not to confront the abuse of discretion issue here#
are we?

Isn’t that what’s left open on the remand by the

Third Circuit?

23
MRS» BABCOCK:

Yes* it is»

But I think that here

this Court should take the approach* should mandate the
approach in this kind of case* which we all have fallen into
the habit of calling reverse Freejdom of Information Act cases»
They are not Freedom of Information Act cases»

They are

Administrative Procedure Act cases»
And the approach of the Court of Appeals here was
exactly right»

If the record ■— if —

QUESTION!

Well* that's the issue* isn’t it?

MRS» BABCOCKs
QUESTION:

It is the issue* and «—

And you're making an argument on the

merits* but we don’t begin with that as a hypothesis agreed
to by both sides»
[Laughter» 3
MRS» BABCOCK:
by both sides»

Oh* no* it’s certainly not agreed to

But that is the point that I am making here*

which is that these very kinds o:: issues* which is the
balancing of the public interest in knowing and the private
interest in concealing* these have risen before to this Court
in ocher contexts* and there is nothing about the Freedom of
Information Act that changes that»
QUESTION:

Of course, in the Schreiber case *—

QUESTION:

Mrs» Babcock — oh, excuse me? go ahead»

QUESTION:

In the Schreiber case it was an agency

proceeding»

The agency was really an interested party in

24

conducting those hearings, was it not?

And here it9s more or

less just a bystander saying, "Lock through our files if you
want to/
MRS0 BABCOCKj

Not at all, Your Honor0

I think

that/s a very important pointo The agency is not a disinterested
bystander,,

We have to look at what the records that are com”

piled here are*

These are records which are demanded from

government contractors as a condition of getting a government
contracte

That people at Chrysler have hundreds of millions

of dollars9 worth of these government contracts, and, as a
condition, they must supply this information to the govern­
ment in the form that the government requires ifce And the
agency has an interest in continuing to get that kind of
information from Chrysler, it has an interest in protecting
Chrysler, if that information — the disclosure of that
information would, in the future, make information less
secure*
QUESTION3

Does the government need to disclose

it to the world at large in order to make use of it for
governmental purposes?
MRS. BABCOCKi

No, it doesn't need to disclose it

to the world at large, except this particular kind of
information, which is equal employment opportunity informa­
tion, has been found, under the regulations of the Labor
Department and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, to

25

be useful for disclosure. The public has an interest in
knowing how the government is doing in its enforcement of
equal employment opportunity; and so that this is peculiarly
a kind of information in which there may be some public
interest, and that the agency should evaluate.
QUESTION : Why does it have more of an interest in
that area than in any number of other areas , where the
Department of Defense receives information?
MRS. BABCOCK:

Why does the agency have more

interest?
QUESTION:

/sic/

Well, why does the agency conclude that
[interest]
the public has more information in the equal employment
operations of the Department of Defense, say, than in the
procurement regulations or the personnel policies or the
veteran3s preference, or something else?
MRS. BABCOCK:

It doesn’t, it doesn’t conclude that

it has more of an interest, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but it
does say that peculiarly there is a current interest in the
enforcement of the Executive Order, and that the ~ but it
is not — but there may be an equal interest in procurement
or any of those other matters.

That the whole basis of the

Freedom of Information Act is that the public does have an
interest in the whole range of governmental activities.
But I think that the real point here is that these
are not — that a clear bright line cannot be drawn between

26

what: are public and private records»

These records here

being created for the government at the command of the govern­
ment e in return for a government contract? and needed by the
government for the enforcement of a program that is the subject
of an Executive Order? and that is one of the major government
programs»

How can you call these private records?
And if they are ~
QUESTIONs

I don't see how any of that has any

relevance if the information is? in fact? trade secrets and
confidential.

The fact that they are doesn't make any

difference if it presents this information or anything else?
does it?
MRSo BABCOCKs

Well? Mr» Justice Stevens? that's

what I was just going to reach.

If there is incorporated

into this record? created for the government? if there is
incorporated necessarily real trade secrets or confidential
commercial information? then there is the possibility of the
submitter challenging? both at the agency level? the release
of that information? and then under the Administrative
Procedure Act in a court? that the agency has gone beyond its
authority? has acted contrary to law? has misapplied its
regulations.
And that's plenty of protection? that's sufficient
protection.
QUESTION:

Well? that depends on the point of view

27

you look at it front, X suppose? but do we not start with the
assxiruption that some of this information is confidential or
trade secret information within the meaning of Exemption 4?
MRS. BABCOCKs
start with that.

Well, we can't starts we can't really

That is going to be one of the subjects of

the remand in this case, that ~
QUESTXONs

But the District Court so found in this

case.
MRS. BABCOCKs

The District Court so found, yes, but

the Court of Appeals said that the record was not sufficient
to determine whether the agency had decided that Exemption 4
applied or whether it didn't apply.

And so that that is an

issue for another day.
Now, for the purposes »*—?
QUESTION?
well in mind.

Well, let's

be sure I have your position

You do take the position, the United States

takes the position that even if Exemption 4 applies,

and even

if the information is a trade secret, a bona fide, genuine
trade secret, they may nevertheless, in their discretion,
decide to disclose it.
MRS. BABCOCKs

Under — Yes, sir,

Under certain

regulations, though, and that is, if the disclosure is in the
public interest and if the disclosure would not harm the
agency's ability to gather information or to do its job in
the future. So that there are --

28

QUESTION:

Even though it would harm the proponent

of the information?
MRS. BABCOCK:

Even though it is confidential

commercial information, it i3 — what we are talking about here,
under these regulations, is a balancing, and the balancing has
to be the harm to the submitter of the information and the
benefit to the public and the need for the public in the
intcsrest of the Freedom of Information Act®
QUESTION:

Did the Court of Appeals find that there

was no substantial evidence to support the findings made by
the District Court?
The District Court found that the information was
confidential, it also found as a fact that the release of it
would be adverse to the interests; of Chrysler®

Now, were

those findings found to be withotit substantial support by
the Court of Appeals?
MRS® BABCOCK:

No, Mr. Justice Powell.

In effect,

the Third Circuit just kind of leaped over the District Court
opinion.

The District Court opinion was very, very narrow

here, and dealt only

— Chrysler was challenging the release

of «ill of the information —
QUESTION:

But for purposes of deciding this case,

do you think we must accept those findings by the District
Court?
MRS. BABCOCK:

No, Your Honor, I don't.

Because

29

what: I have asked —
QUESTIONS

What do we do with them?

MRS« BABCOCKS

What you do with them is affirm the

judgment of the Third Circuit ~
QUESTIONS

I understands

MRS o BABCOCK s

— which sort of skipped over the

findings of the District Court arid said
[Laughter,]
MRS , BABCOCKs

— and raid that the case should go

back to the agency for a further record, and mandated the
creation of the kind of record which would allow a District
Court to review these kinds of cases under the Administrative
Procedure Act,
QUESTION?

May I ask you this :

Let's assume for

the moment that the case does go back, and these findings are
reaffirmed, say, by the agency,

I understand from your

argument that the agency, in its balancing discretion,
nevertheless may release them; right?
MRS, BABCOCK:
QUESTION:

Yes,

That's correct, Your Honor,
The next question is this:

Would

it be possible for the agency,under the regulations that
now exist or under new regulations, to write to, say, all of
the companies in the automobile industry and say, "I know you
all want this information on your competitors? rather than
put us to the trouble of arranging for you to have them

30

copied here, from now on send carbon copies of everything you
send us on this case to Ford, General Motors and American
Motorso03

Would that be appropriate?
MRS» BABCOCK;

No, that would not be appropriate,

because the agency has a function here»

And the

agency —

and we really, I don®t think, car?, down-play this; the agency
has an interest in continuing to get information. And the
agency has an interest in not upsetting its contractors, and
it has an interest in doing an appropriate balance»

And it

has the expertise»
QUESTION s

Does the record in this case show what

interest the agency has in making this information available
to competitors of Chrysler?
MRS» BABCOCK:

No, it does not, and I think it

could be made very clear that the requesters in this case
are not corapetitors of Chrysler, and in fact, in the vast
majority —
QUESTION:

They could be, couldn9t they?

Any

member of the public»
MRS» BABCOCK:

Any member — there is no distinction

made among requesters, but if we look at the real world and
what's really happening in those so-called reverse Freedom
of Information Act cases, the requesters are not the competitors»
The requesters are members of the public, newspaper people,
public interest groups, potential plaintiffs and actual

31
plaintiffs in discrimination suits.

That's who the requesters

have been in these cases.
QUESTION:

Would the information be denied if one

showed up and said, "I represent General Motors and I’d like
to have this information"?
MRS. BABCOCKt

No, it wouldn’t, except that in the

balancing that the agency doss, emd in the administrative
record that the agency would makes, it would certainly, I think,
be taken into account, when you weigh the interest of Chrysler
in withholding the information, who the requester was.
QUESTION:

But if General Motors was denied, they

could just ask their friendly newspaper to go get them for
then.
MRS. BABCOCK:

That’s certainly true. And that’s

why the Act — I mean, that’s one of the problems of the
Freedom of Information Act, that there is no way to distin­
guish among requesters.
QUESTION:

But I ~

But this includes the group of people

who nay organise a corporation as Industrial Intelligence,
Incorporated, to gather the information, classify it, and
then sell it to the people who we re interested.
MRS. BABCOCK:

That is happening.

And that is

certainly a distressing aspect of the Freedom of Information
Act.

But that is not ~~ it doesn’t have anything to do with

this case.

So I think that —

32

QUESTIONS

What would we do if we disagree with

you or the agency , that if this is within Exemption

namely ,

really a trade secret, that the agency may not release if;
what do we do in this case?

We certainly don’t affirm, do

we?
MRS. BABCOCKs

Your Honor, you don’t have a record

here which would allow you to find that this

is information

that *—
QUESTIONS
we

I didn’t ask that.

I just asked what do

someone gave you a hypothetical that said if there are

really trade secrets involved here, could the agency still
release this by exercising its balance; and you said yes.
Now, what if we disagree with you there?
That if there are trade secrets involved here, the
agency may not release them. Then, what do we do?
MRS. BABCOCKs
QUESTION?

Well, what you would have to do ~

Under any circumstances they may not

release them.
MRS. BABCOCKs

What you would have to do, as a

legal matter, Your Honor, is to find that Exemption 4 is
mandatory.

How, you can’t find that, I think, in the face of
QUESTIONS

Yes, but suppose we do; what do we do

then?
MRS. BABCOCK;

Well, if you do, I would submit

you’ve made an incorrect legal decision.

But that may happen time and again hare,

QUESTION;

But, nevertheless, would you lose your

case?
MRS, BABCOCKs

If you find that Exemption 4 is

mandatory, we certainly lose our case, yes,
QUESTION?

Or what if we found that 1905 prevented

the agency from ~ even if Exemption 4 was permissive,
Exemption 3 invokes 1905, and that the agency may not
release the materials under 1905?
MRS, BABCOCK!

Well, 1905 — you don't — if you

find that 1905 applies here, and that these materials should
have been withheld under 1905, then you don't need to reach
the point of whether it is an Exemption 3, whether 1905 is
an Exemption 3 statute,
QUESTION!

If 1905 -— if the agency has held a

hearing and decided that the matt;rial should be released,
1905,

by definition, does not apply; isn't that right?
MRS, BABCOCKs

If the agency has held a hearing and

decided that the material should be released -QUESTION!

Then 1905, by definition, does not

prohibit its release, since it's then — if an agency regula*"

tion will bring it within the "as authorised by law” clause
of the 19050

Absolutely. And —

And that is one of the

And yet I would draw your attention to

this Court's opinion in Blair vs, Oesterlein, in which there
was a subpoena from the Board of Tax Appeals to the Commis­
sioner of Internal Revenue for the tax returns of twelve
corporations, and this case was under the predecessor statute
of ISQ5, one of the predecessor statutes.

And there this

Court held that 1905 was raised as a defense.
said,

The Commissioner

can't give up these records, because I would be in

violation of the statute.”

And there this Court said that

1905 cannot be deemed to forbid disclosures made in obedience
to process lawfully issued.
Now, -that was a subpoena, that was not a statute,
and it was also not a regulation, I would be the first to
admit; but it was not a statute.

So that certainly "authorized

35
by law” within the meaning of 1905 goes beyond the strict
requirement of a statute»
And I would also call to the Court’s attention that
a statute that tracks 1905 exactly has been put into the

IRS

Code of 1954, and this is 26 U.S.Code 7213, and that is just
like 1905, in terms of being a criminal statute»
And in the Laugh!in case, cited in our brief at page
43, the D» C» Circuit said specifically that regulations
permitting release of this kind of information covered by
1905, for use of grand juries, was authorized by law»
So that there are -- arid there are other citations
in our brief, and then there is the general legal principle

QUESTION:

Doesn’t a regulation have to be adopted

after notice and chance for comment, or would just an

I think it would depend on the

regulations were valid, that this pattern of regulations are
valid.

Now, that would be one of the issues to be raised by

36

submitters in their challenge under the APA, which is the
design that we're arguing here,
QUESTIONS

Is it

open to a district judge, confronted

with this problem, to hold that the discretion under Exemption
4 has been abused in granting disclosure?
MRS

b

BABCOCKS

QUESTIONS

Is it permissive --

MRS, BABCOCKs
QUESTION:

Is —?

Yes, I think that — yes, under the ■—

Can the district judge say, nY@s e they

have discretion, but here, on the record made before me, the
discretion has been abused, and therefore I deny this order,"
MRS, BABCOCKs

Under the standard of review that

we're arguing, under the Administrative Procedure Act, it
would be open to the District Court to say that the agency
committed a clear error cf judgment, and it would also go to
whether the agency acted within the scope of its authority.
And Mr, Justice White's concern with whether the regulations
that it was acting under were properly promulgated, were
proper regulations? whether the agency followed its own
regulations. All of those things would be open to review under
the Administrative Procedure Act in the scheme that the Third
Circuit devised, and that we are urging here,
I want to return just for a minute to the point
that Exemption 4 cannot be correctly read as being mandatory,
Mr, Braverman says that perhaps, in trying to make it

37

mandatory e Congress could ha'/e been a little clearer*
they couldn't have bean any clearer,,

Well,

They included it within

tiie other nine exemptions, and they started out, the heading
to the nine exemptions, with;

"This Act compelling disclosure

does not apply t;oK the nine exemp tions .
So that the exemptions themselves neither direct
disclosure nor direct withholding* The exemptions are set out
in the statutory pattern, and it really could not be more
plain that they are a guide to tie agency in deciding whether
to disclose or whether to withhold*
In its starkest terms, Exemption 4 can't be
mandatory because Congress, if it had made Exemption 4 —
and there’s no distinction between Exemption 4 and any other
exemption; other exemptions cover private information also -that they would have, if they had made this exemption
mandatory, created a withholding statute that went far beyond
what the law was before the Freedom of Information Act*
And .literally, I mean, Congress cannot be that stupid, when
they were trying to make a Freedom of Information Act, that
they created a withholding statute is not possible, and that
would have to be the result of finding Exemption 4 to be
mandatory *
QUESTION;

Then your argument would — that view of

the statute would .lead to the conclusion that, with respect
to material covered by the exemption, one just disregards the

38

Freedom of Information Act» Right?
MRSo BABCOCK:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor»

That with respect to that, anything

covered by the nine exemptions, one just pretends the Freedom
of Information Act had never been enacted»

That’s the

result of your argument.
MRS» BABCOCK:
would be:

I mean, the analysis

does the information fall within an exemption?
QUESTION:

Act»

In a sense.

If so, forget the Freedom of Information

Isn’t that right?
MRS» BABCOCK:

Doesn’t that follow?
That’s correct, Your Honor» And if

it does, the Act does not apply. And then the agency may
decide «—
QUESTION:

Well, subject to 1905 and to any of the

other laws, too.
MRS. BABCOCK:

Subject to nondisclosure statutes,

subject to the public interest ir disclosure. And the agencies
often decide to withhold, on the basis of one of these
exemptions»
QUESTION:

Yea, but the agency may or may not

have discretion, but whether or rot it does is to be determine!
by laws other than the Freedom of Information Act.
MRS» BABCOCK:
QUESTION:
isn’t it?

That’s exactly right, Your Honor»

And that’s a part of your argument,

39

MRS 0 BABCOCK t
QUESTIONS

That is my argument»

But, General Babcock, I thought you had

said —«* perhaps I misunderstood you — that in the hearing
that the agency would conduct, that Exemption 4 would have
to be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not to
release»
MRSe BABCOCKS

It would be taken — in practical

terms, it would be taken into account in the balancing that
is done -QUESTIONS

How is that consistent with your answer

to Mr» Justice Stewart*s question?
MRS» BABCOCKs

It is that as a matter of

statutory construction, once it is decided that material falls
within the Act, then the Act does not ~ falls within one
of the Exemptions, then the Act does not apply»
However, when the agency then goes on to say, "Should
we release this

material?

We don't — it falls within one

of the exemptions, so it is not mandatorily released, but we
are going to go on and decide whether or not the public interest
requires it, whether there are other interests, whether there
are nondisclosure statutes", one of the things that the agency
might well take into account are the same concerns that caused
Congress to pass Exemption 4»

Aid it wouldn't actually be

applying Exemption 4, but it would be —QUESTIONs

I don't understand this*

If you can't

QUESTION:

QUESTIONs

In 1789 they weren't releasing it»

MBS. BABCOCKs

They didn't. And certainly — I am

not saying — this is a tool of analysis in terms of reading
the statute.

I am not saying that the Freedom of Information

Act is not implicated in any analysis hare* but it is —certainly the Exemption 4 is not mandatory. And once it3s
decided that materials fall within Exemption 4 , the agency
may withhold them and fight this requester or they may move
on and decide whether, within their regulations, within the
statute, within the public interest, it is wise —
QUESTIONs

Whereas, when the Act does apply, it

must be released.
MRS. BABCOCKs

That's exactly right.

That is the

point.
QUESTIONS

Could a District Court reverse the

agency under the APA abuse of discretion standard when the
agency had decided to release the information, if the District
Court; felt it should have applied Exemption 4 and not released
it?
MRS. BABCOCKs

If the agency had so far misread, and

the remand in this case seems to take that into account, if
the agency had so far misread Exemption 4, that it was a
clear error in judgment so as to be an .abuse of discretion
or to be contrary to law, than the District Court could.
The short answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question.

42
QUESTION;

Is there a large amount of information,

Mrs. Babcock, that the government has in its files which is
supplied voluntarily by many different industries in the
country?
MRS. BABCOCK;

It depends on what you mean by

voluntary, Mr. Chief Justice, and —
QUESTION; Well, that they are not required to
furnish it.

They furnish it or they do not furnish it? that9s

their own choice.
MRS. BABCOCK;

They furnish it because of their

interest in getting government contracts, in getting the
government on their side, persuading the government to do
what they want to do.
QUESTION;

Well, the Forest

Service, for example,

asked for and received a lot of information which the
suppliers need not give to them if they don't want to.
take that as one category, and there are many others.

Now,
The

environmental people are very much interested in that, the
environmental people within the government, not outside the
government.

Now, that information which has been voluntarily

furnished to the government for its over-all purposes is
available, subject to the Freedom of Information Act, is it
noth

MRSo BABCOCKS And that’s exactly what the effects
of this opinion would be, the remand in this case, and if this
Court would mandate this as the proper procedure, is for the
agency to make a proper record or whether the materials
fall into Exemption 4 and then why they have found it is
in the public interest for there to be a release®

injunction against the release of it»

My question iss

what guarantee do they

have that the information will not be released while they are
trying to make a record?
MRS. BABCOCKs

They have the ability to go to court,

to stop it from being released.

I see,

I came to the wrong conclusion.

Well# they do# you concede they have a right to go to court?
MRS. BABCOCKs

Yes# absolutely.

that we’re concerned with is the standard of review and the
statute under which ites reviewed.

And they would still have

that same right.
And,, in fact# they have exercised it freely.
In closing# let me say that though I started by
saying that this is not a Freedom of Information Act case,
it is obvious that the Freedom of Information Act is implicated
here# and in the Court’s decision ■— and we are in great need
of direction from the Court in this kind of case.

We ask

that you mandate the orderly procedure under the Administrative
Procedure Act# which the Third Circuit has established! that
you hold that neither Exemption 4# nor# for that matter# any
other exemption is mandatory? that you find that validly
issued regulations are authorization by law? and that you
act# in this opinion# in truth to the spirit of the FQIA#
with all its faults and its burdens and its daily difficult

MR. BRAVERMANs

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Very well.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BURT A. BRA.VERMAM, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRAVERMAN s

This is something of a case where

the pendulum has swung a bit too far. Congress was attempting
to eliminato government secrecy, and one way it was going to
do that was to get rid of the so-called public interest
standard that was in Section 3 of the Administrative Procedure
Act in the Fifties and early Sixties.

That public interest

standard is used to shield agency documents.
Now, ‘the government is here, ten, twelve, fourteen
years later, and it*s sayings

Well, we9re going to decide

these questions under that public interest standard.
th@n<

Back,

it was the public8s right that was being sacrificed when

the agency exercised or misexercised that public interest
standard.

Today it's” the private person8s right that8s

being sacrificed, when the agency again, lacking an adequate
record, lacking any standards, lacking any guidelines, simply
says?

We’re going to ignore the fact that disclosure of

this information is going to cause you what the District Court
found to be substantial competitive injury, end because of

50

what we perceive to be the better way of things, the public
interest, we®re going to disclose those documents»
I don9t think Congress ever intended that the
pendulum swing so far that the private interests, in their
property and in their privacy, be damaged like that»
The District Court found —■
QUESTIONS

Your problem is to get a record on that,

isn6t it?
MR» BRAVERMAN s

The problem is that there cannot be

an adequate record in these Cctses®

In almost all of the

reversa-FOIA cases that have gone to the Court of Appeals,
in this case, in the Sears v» Eckerd case in the Seventh
Circuit, in the General Dynamics case in the Eighth Circuit,
the agency found that the documents should be disclosed»
The reverse-»FOIA claimants went to court, and the District
Court found that there would be substantial competitive injury,
and then, because those courts found that there should be APA
review, they remanded»

They did rot find that the finding of

competitive injury was improper, they simply said that the
agency should have been the ones to examine whether there
would be injury»
The problem is that undor the FOXA the agency cannot
conduct an adequate fact-finding inquiry, because it doesn91
have the time»

In this case, we v?ere notified --

QUESTIONS

Nor does the court have the time»

51
MR0 BRAVERf IAN s
QUESTION z

The court —

Why would we have the time if nobody

else has it?
MR, BRAVERMANs

The difference is that the court is

not subject to the ten-day limitation that is found in the
FOIA, and the agencies are*

I mean, it is simply impossible

for an agency employee, who has no expertise on the question
of determining competitive injury, to get, in some case,
thousands of pages of documents in front of him and to try
to make a judgment in a matter of days, and also to assume
that the company itself can make the kind of showing necessary
in this casec

And this is just impossible, and this is what

gives rise to our contention that the agency's fact-finding
procedures here are inadequate»

It’s the procedures, the

fact-finding procedure that is inadequate, not merely the
record in these cases.
And under this Court's precedent in Overton Park,
even if you wera to find that the APA was the proper basis
for review, we think you should still find that there is a
right to a de novo trial until the time that Congress gets
around to saying that the ten-day period won't work.
And I hasten to add that the Freedom of Information
Act amendments in 874, when the ten-day period was added,
were vetoed by the President, in part because he expressly
say that the ten-day limit won't workf it would be impossible

52

to operate under the Act.
QUESTION?

Suppose under the — without the Freedom

of Information Act, before it was even passed, 1905 was on
the books.

Suppose the agency could, by a sat of regulations,

provide for the release of the information covered by 1905?
Suppose its regulations would qualify as the law?
MR. BRAVERMAlls

If regulations would qualify, then

perhaps those regulations could disarm the Trade Secret law.
They would constitute authorisation by law.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

And let's suppose that, and then

comes the Freedom of Information Act.

You say that the

Freedom of Information Act would forbid the disclosure of
what the agency could have disclosed before the Act?
MR. BRAVERMANs

The express affirmation in the

legislative history «—
QUESTION:

Is it yes or no?

MR. BRAVERMANs

Yes.

QUESTIONS

Okay.

QUESTIONS

Yes.

So that whit was purported to be, on the

part of Congress, an Act setting a floor under disclosure by
tli© agency, in your view set a ceiling, in at least one case?
MR. BRAVERMANs

It continued to recognize the

practice of the standard —
QUESTIONS

Justice White's question was that, did

the Freedom of Information Act change the previous ~

53
QUESTIONS

Did it lock up — did the Freedom of

Information Act lock up something that was available before
or not?
MR® BRAVERMAN %

The information, as a practical

matter, —
QUESTIONS

You said it did®

MR® BRAVERMANs
QUESTIONS

~ was not available®

You said it did®

MR® BRAVERMANs

It was not available, and it provided

mandatory protection for it®
QUESTION s

Yes, but my example was s

suppose that

before the Freedom of Information Act passed, this information
was available, even though — under 1905, because the agency
had provided for release by regulation?
MR® BRAVERMANs

It had regulations, yes®

QUESTIONS All right®

Then comes the Freedom of

Information Act, and you say that what was previously avail­
able is now unavailable®
QUESTIONS

Because of Exemption 4 and its legislative

—as to what it means®
MR® BRAVERMANs
QUESTIONS

That goes back to your submission®

Was it not one of the considerations of

Congress that FOIA was an effort to have some harmony and
uniformity among the dozens and dozens of agencies about
disclosure? was that a factor?

54
MR. BRAVERMAN:

Certainly it was the intention to

eliminate the public interest standard that was unevenly
applied by agencies.

By eliminating the public interest

standard and by putting in a legislative standard that Congress
set; and not the agency, yes, the intent was to eliminate
that —
QUESTIONS

But you say that it's still unevenly

applied because each agency has a different view of the
exemptions.
MR.

Do I understand that?
BRAVERMAN:

A different view, perhaps, and also

differing amounts of expertise, different perceptions of
what the public interest should be.
Congress had the uniform perception of what the
public interest would be.
If I Could respond to Mr. Justice White's question.
The one thing that should be noted is that we do not believe
that Congress intended agency regulations to constitute —
QUESTIONS

I'm quite aware of that.

But your

submission is that even if it did, the Freedom of Information
Act changed the rules?
i

MR. BRAVERMAN:

It would have to be read as a later

legislative statement, yes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:45 p.m., the case was submitted.3
