MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Organization.
Mr, Young, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID H. YOUNG ON BEHALF OF
THE PETITIONERS
MR. YOUNG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

Please the Court:
The dispute in this case arises as a result of a
March 1, 1973 conversion that the State of Texas of what was
then known as the Department of Public Welfare made in the
methods and procedures that it used to calculate a standard „
of need in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.
States are permitted by Section SOI in Title 42-—Section 401
of the Social Security Act—to define the standard of need that
they will utilize in the AFDC program.

This Court has fre­

quently stated and restated since King against Smith, that
states have that latitude.
Before the March 1, 1973 conversion, the state's
method of determining an individual's need for AFDC went
through four steps:
First, a maximum standard of need was established,
which is not in dispute.
Second, a personal needs allowance, a shelter

4
allowance, and a utilities allowance were combined.

That portion

is in dispute.
Third,, the percentage reduction factor was applied;
And fourth, the amount of any non-exempt income was
deducted from what was referred to as the recognised need
which was the product of those first three steps.
Much of that of course was outlined in your prior
decision in Jefferson against Hackney.
The problem arises because c£ one step that Texas
went through with regard to the shelter and utilities allow­
ances that it allowed to be included in the standard of need,
that word being pro rationed.

The method that Texas used was

to count the number of individuals in the household without
regard to whether they were eligible or not, and then subtract
the appropriate per capita share for those people who were
determined to be ineligible.
After March 1, 1973, the Texas conversion provided for
a flat grant system.

There is essentially no longer any dispute

in this case that Texas can handles flat grant or that other state
can have a flat grant.
The shelter and utilities figures that Texas used
and from which this lawsuit comes were consolidated with the
personal needs figures and averaged.

Neither the consolidation

per se nor the averaging is in issue.
Nhat the state did under the new system was say

that you get so many dollars per eligible recipients, rather
than the former method of taking all the individuals in the
household and then backing out a per capita share for those
who were determined to be ineligible»

1 think simply I would

characterize the new method as just simple addition.

You add

up the numbers for the eligible people there, whereas before
v ou added

up

numbers for everyone and then backed out a share

for the ineligible."? and that's the pro ration.
QUESTION:

What practical difference did that change

make?
MR. YOUNG:

X hope to demonstrate there is no practical

difference. It has been widely assumed that there is, and that
has been, in large part, the basis for the Fifth Circuit's
decision that I am seeking to overturn.
It is important in that regard to keep pro ration
snd economies of scale as separate questions.

There is no

dispute that the states can utilize economies of scale in
establishing needs standards.

Economies of scale, by the way,

is not justification for pro ration, despite the contention that
occa; xonally occurs that economies of scale is just another way
of saying the state assumes availability of income and runs
contrary to everything the Court has said since King against
Smith.
In the District Court, Respondents iriled suit against
the new system, saving (1) that it violated Fection 602(a)(235,

6
or the cost of living increase requirement of the Social
Security Act to use a flat grant, the flat grant being what
I described as just the simple addition of the average numbers
rather than the former method establishing a figure for individ­
uals; and also alleged that the state's new system violated
602(a)(7) which is the provision that requires the states to
deduct available income; 606(b) which has to do with whether
or not the states can make restrictive payment, which we say
is not in issue here; and 602 (a) (23) which is the cost of living
requirement.

They said by including the pro rated numbers,

it obscured the standard of need aind therefore did not give
a true cost-of-living raise as required bv 602(a)(23).
The District court took jurisdiction of the alleged
Social Security Act violations under 23 O.S.C. 1343(4) and.Judge
Bue was was required to buy the Fifth Circuit's decision in
Gomea against Florida Employment Service.
The rights involved which were found to be cognizable
under 1343(4} were rights that the: Fifth Circuit characterized
as rights of an essentially personal nature, referring to the
need to have food, need to have shelter, a place to live,
things such as this.

But the District Court found

for your

Petitioners here on the merits of the case.
After the District Court entered its opinion, the
Respondents here attempted to re-open and amend their case
to raise a constitutional issue.

They had not alleged any

7
constitutional issue up to the time the District Court made
its decision.

However, in considering their motions to re­

open and motions to amend, the Court said that the demands
of the docket do not allow "a party who has had its day in
court to restructure and reolead its case merely because it
has obtained an adverse decision/'
QUESTION:

You would oppose any remand for the purpose

of amending the complaint?
MR. YOUNG:

Yes, your Honor.

As I understand the

general practice where effectively the jurisdictional basis
of pleadings are; allowed to be amended sometime during the
appellate process, it is where the superior court

and the

appellate court is looking for an alternative means to
uphold the decision of the court below that has already been
made.

In this case, the District Court said they not only

had to raise it or brief it or argue it, but there was no proof
in the record tc support what the District Court took to be due
process claimed which was not due process or anything else in
their motion to relieve, amend or re-open.
QUESTION:

You feel then if we should reach the merits»

that the Van Lare case is not controlling?
MR. YOUNG:

Yes.
<

QUESTION:

There was a constitutional claim here in

the sense that there was a supremacy clause, wasn't there?
MR. YOUNG:

Yes, I hoped to speak to it very little.

8

QUESTION:

Whenever the jurisdictional claim is based

upon a conflict between a state's statute or policy and a federal
statute, and the claim being made that the state is acting
inconsistently with the federal statute, that necessarily is
a supremacy clause claim, isn't it, which is a constitutional
claim?
NR, YOUNG:

Well, that is how it is characterised,

yes „
QUESTION: Mr. Young, you say you hope to speak to it
very little,

Ls I read your petition or your brief on the merits

of the first auestion raised in your brief on the merits, if
you notice, the case set for argument after yours, is one in
which that's the only question raised.
HR. YOUNG:

What I meant by that, what I did in

the petition for certiorari, you will notice that all that was
available to me as to Gonzales against Young vras a short summary
:n United States Law Week and my petition was based on Andrews
against Ptahsr

and Randall v. Goldmark.

Subsequently and prior

ho the preparation of my brief, I did obtain a copy of Gonzales
against Young and in all candor I hope to comment on the
Respondent’s petition about it, but I cannot improve on or shed
any additional light, I think, really, on the rationale that the
Third Circuit used, and I stand on it with the State of New Jersey.
To the extent that it addresses the issue I raised,
wiich is 1343(4), not 1343(3), and with regard to that distinction

between the two possible bases for jurisdiction, the Fifth
Circuit found with the District Court that it was Subsection
(4) which was the basis for jurisdiction, not Subsection (3) ,
and they declined to find the existence of a Subsection (3)
claim, even though by that time it had arguably been briefed
fcy Respondents in the District Court and had been repeatedly
urged as a method to reopen the whole case, was sought by them
to be considered by the Fifth Circuit.

The Fifth Circuit said

that’s not what we have here; we have a Subsection (4) case.
But they did on one issue on the merits overturn
the Fifth Circuit on the pro ration question, and say that
pro ration was cin impermissible assumption of income except
when the recipient lives with nondependent relatives in the
latter’s shelter.
My petition for certiorari was -intentionally and
knowingly limited to as to jurisdiction 1343(4).
I also alleged that the Fifth Circuit failed to
appreciate this Court’s opinion in Jefferson against Hackney,
where it considered what the real requirements of 602(a)(23)
were, and determined chat Texas had already met them and over­
looked the chars.cterination in Rosado against Wyman and
repeated in Jefferson that it was adventuresome for the courts
to attempt to alter the state's ability to set a standard of
need.
I did say also that the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted

Io
this Court's decision in Van Lare

because Van Lare really had

to do with assumptions of income; it didn't really have anything
to do with the state’s proper calculation of its standard
of need,

I hasten to add I recognize the last paragraph of

Van hare is there, because it jumps out at you and it is quoted
in the Fifth Circuit's decision, and I will get to that later,
I don’t think that that's controlling in this case.
The Respondents say that Subsection (3) of 1343
is also before the Court, which I do not agree, but I will have
to after lunch, because it will be then,
against Young.

and in Gonzales

But they did agree with me that the issue on

the merits,/weather or not the state complied with the cost-ofliving increase

requirement of 602(a)(23).

QUESTION;

Excuse me, Mr. Young.

While we are on

this subject, looking at the opinion of the Court of Appeals
in this case, which begins on page B-30 of your Petition for
Certiorari., an initial footnote which so far as I know, is
the entire discussion by the Court of this jurisdictional prob­
lem, isn’t it?
MR. YOUNG: It is, yes.
QUESTION:

And in that footnote the Court says,

"Although other circuits disagree,

... we have held that

Section 1983 is an 'Act of Congress' providing for the protectior,
of civil rights,’ sufficient to invoke Section 1343(4} jurisdic­
tion."

Is there in fact disagreement on that general r

11

proposition?
MR. YOUNG:
QUESTION:

As to subparagraph 4?
As to whether or not 1983 is an Act of

Congress providing protection of civil rights, to invoke 1343
for jurisdiction.

Is there any disagreement on that?

HR. YOUNG:
former.

As to the lcitter part, yes? not to the

Whether it is sufficient to invoke 1343 for juris­

diction is an issue.
QUESTION:

That is an issue because—I thought the disaoreement was whether

or not this lawsuit is within the ambit of 1343(4), or your
opponents say 1343(3) or (4).
MR. YOUNG:
QUESTION:
is;

Well—
Not whether a lawsuit that is within 1343

There is jurisdiction for such a lawsuit under 130 3,

I

don't think there is any disagreement about that.
HR. YOUNG:

Well, perhaps I wasn't following your

first question.
QUESTION:

In other words, what I don't''"follow is

the footnote, and I'm asking you if you can help me in explain­
ing it.
MR. YOUNG: Well, I think the explanation is the

"

confusion among the effects of the supremacy clause on the one
hand, 1983 on the other hand, and then the two subsections of
1343 plus the Social Security Act.

These cases really arise

under and depend upon interpretation of the Social Security Act,

12

none of the above, and they do not emanate—these programs,
income transfer programs are needed ; they don't find their
genesis in either the supremacy clause or the 14th Amendment,
and that in a nutshell, of course, is the jurisdictional argu­
ment in this case.
I notice the clock is running and I am taking more
time than I intended to.

I want to get to the merits because

that's where my case is different than the next one.

I would

assert that—
QUESTION:

Nobody gets to the merits if you are

right on your jurisdictional claim, isn't that correct?
MR. YOUNG:

That's true but I would feel better

if I didn't take that chance.

And my client might say I never

really appealed, anyway.
I used one example in my brief on the; merits to try
to show the process as it was applied in cases to distinguish
between determining need, on the one hand, and determing
amount of income on the other hand.

I won't belabor that now

but I tried to show that there is a very real difference
between need and income per se.
Let me talk a little bit about establishing the
standard--of need and refer you to the Ortega family in this
case, the original plaintiffs still in the case.

They were

recipients of adult assistance programs that are no longer in
existence.

The Ortegas had four members in the family.

Two

13

were eligible for AFDC, one for permanently and totally dis­
abling, one for wholly ineligible,

For four people, if they

bad all been eligible, the shelter allowance would have been
$44.

That's $11 per person if they were all eligible.

petitioners here pro-rated and gave $33.

The

The result would be

the same if they had established an $11 per individual need
figure and simply added enough and disregarded the ineligible
person there.
Pro-ration doesn’t have any effect at all unless
you first assume the state is obligated to provide for the
need of an ineligible person.

I submit to the court if you

don’t first assume that, pro-ration has no effect; and of course
we say the Court has never said we have to do that, and you
shouldn51 now„
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume at one

o1 clock.
.Whereupon, at 12s00~o-clock noon, the court was
recessed, to be reconvened at. 1:00 o'clock, p.m. the same
day.)

14
AFTERNOON SESSION

{1:01 p.m.)

MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: You may continue, Mr. Young.
MR. YOUNG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court, after the consolidation took
place in 1973, the shelter allowances in Texas for one to two
persons were $33; for three to four persons, $44; for five or
®ore, $50.

The Ortega household had four persons, so the

proper shelter allowance would be $44, if they were all
eligible.
What the state did, of course, was pro-rate and
come up with a shelter allowance
$33.

for that household of

I have already attempted to discuss how that happens.
I would like to take just a moment to discuss

what the Respondents wanted to have happen.
grants, remember, in the household:
APTD.

There were two

one for AFDC, one for

The Respondents desire, as I believe the record reflects

at page 221, that the initial $33 shelter allowance be
included for the tv,-a AFDC . recipients, and another initial
$33 shelter allowance be included for the one APTD recipient,
and of course the fourth person be disregarded.

So their

result would be a $66 shelter allowance for this household
of three recipients as opposed to the $44 which the state would,
budget and which figure they don’t challenge in this litigation.
Had all four persons been eligible, a 50 percent increase over
that amount and of course twice what the state maintains is the

15

proper amount, three individuals, $33«
The Fifth Circuit said the state's pro-ration
policy violated the 1976 Federal Regulations because pro-ration
was a presumption that income was available to the eligible
recipients.

That's incorrect on several bases.

Need, as

defined by the Social Security Act and bv the state is not
actual shelter cost in any given case.

The Fifth Circuit

also ignored the fact that there was no change in the shelter
allowance for any given recipient named in this case at $11.
It assumed that the state must provide shelter for ineligibles.
I have already mentioned, I believe,that that's an assumption
which this Court has never indulged in consciously, and I urge
you not to today.
Of course not even the Respondents allege that the
state has to assume the burden for providing for the personal
needs of a non-recipient if he lives with the recipients; they
don't assert that the state has tc provide Medicaid benefits
for the non-recipient, so we urge fcr the sake of consistency,
if nothing else, that the state net be obligated to provide
for the shelter and utilities of that person because they hap­
pen to live with the recipient.

We certainly wouldn't have

to if they did not live with the recipient.
The Fifth Circuit also of course relies on this
Court's decision in Van Lare.

We maintain there are several

distinctions between our case and Van Lare, several things that

16
need to be said about Van Lare.
One, the New York policies do you mention income,
and we say did treat the situation in New York as an income
question as opposed to a needs question.

They use the word in

their policies and it has to mean something.

Van Lare is

Remarkable in that it criticizes states for not prohibiting
lodgers from being in welfare homes.

I say that’s remarkable

because that was a case where two of the constitutional claims
alleged were privacy and freedom of association.
Van Lare also criticizes the state for taking no
further action other than to allegedly reduce—I would not say
reduce—-but allegedly reduce the '.mount for shelter.

The only

thing else the state could do is cut off the grants entirelv
and that would run into King against Smith and any number of your
prior decisions.
The Court said that the only victim is the needy
child but 1 have attempted to demonstrate that the amount of
the shelter need allegedly for the needy child was not affected
by proration.
Not even the Fifth Circuit completely ignored the
implications of its holding because it did say that when the
non-recipient owns the home, that the proration is permissible.
How that is not an assumption of income but the other is, is
.not explained.

That is a distinction that is not recognized in

the 197? HEW regulations upon which the Solicitor General

relies and upon which Respondents rely.

17
But the Fifth Circuit's

distinction is not challenged here because there is no petition
for certiorari from Respondents.
Not incidentally, HEW prior to this time had not found
any fault with proration.

The record at 245, in the Appendix

at 40, there are instructions .from the Dallas Regional Office
to Texas to include prorated figures in the consolidated amounts
and it even said in the record at 253 how HEW instructed the
states to include its mistakes as well as the correct amounts
and not attempt to determine which is which because the object
of the fair pricing and consolidation was to come up with the
average amounts that the state actually paid.
Another way of saying all this is my last argument
and that is the state discretion argument; 42 U.S.C. 601
clearly allows the states to set their standard of need based on
the conditions of each state and provide assistance as far as
practicable.

That has been recognised by this Court, as 1 have

said/ from King against Smith, as recently as Quorun against
Manley, right at the end of last term.
We think that states have legitimate interests in
this arec?., such as they had in your decision in Wyman against
James and Be Blanc? against New York, Department of Social
Services, and the goal in this case is not to provide shelter
and utilities for people who are ineligible, wherever they live,
whether it is with the recipients or not.

The bottom line in

18

the ease of course, is that there is not enough money in Texas
ho provide for the actual needs of these individuals.

The

Respondents sought to attack that by attacking proration, but
to increase the needs standard in Texas by some $9 million,
as would be the case if this were done, doesn't increase
anything except the number of ineligibles getting benefits.
It doesn't increase the state appropriation.

The only result

it would have is that the percentage control factor, which is
now 75 percent, would have to be cut further and the money that
would go to the newly created ineligible recipients would be
taken out of the pockets of the people that are admittedly
eligible.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Skarda.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY J. SKARDA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SKARDA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may. it please

the Court:
We take issue with Petitioners' characterization of
the rent range formulas.

He claims that our client was budgeted

for $33 net shelter allowance, just like she was before her
mother and sister moved in.

What he overlooked in fact is

that for a household of three end four recipients, they would
have been budgeted the $44 maximum and did receive only $33.
If San Juana Ortega, who was the public assistance recipient.

19

as well as 'Paula Ortega, her child, had moved in by herself
without her mother, who was necessary for her to take care
of her, that household would have been budgeted $44 for rent.
Because the mother came in, the household was only budgeted
$33 and paid 75 percent of that.
We believe this case is controlled by Van hare versus
Hurley. It involves a $9 million 'substantial question of which
at least 65 percent is federal dollars, and we in our brief
at page 46 lay out the same budgeting arguments in Van hare
next to the budgeting arguments in the instant case, and you
can see that the dollar maximum works almost .identical.
We would also like to note that his references
regarding HEW approval.

HEW approval came before this Court’s

decision in Van hare versus Hurley.

Since the Court decision,

HEW has codified that regulation , the first two pages of our
brief, and we believe there is a clear conflict between that
HEW codification, this Court’s decision in Van Lara versus
Hurley, and the state welfare regulation on proration.
Finally I would like to reake it clear that we are not
alleging $66 rent allowance for the family? we are alleging that
they should receive the same rent allowance for any family of
three persons or a $44 rent allowance.
There is another issue regarding whether or not we
-an raise our arguments for jurisdiction under Section 1343(3)
in addition to Section 1343(4).

At our brief on page 16 we lay

out the cases of this Court that allow us, and for defending
decision below, to put forth the argument which would give us
the same relief and at least as to jurisdictional grounds
m

the way we read Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment and
Langnes v. Green and United States v. American Railway Express
Co. are placing these issues in opposition to the petition for
certiorari that brings them before this Court, and we would
like to begin now our jurisdictional argument on Section 1343(3)
jurisdiction authorized by 1983 to rights secured by the
Constitution via the Supremacy Clause.
There is of course another argument under Section
r?Meory,°and this would mean that
the rights would come into the
the Social Security Act of 1983.

„and laws« provision through
As this Court has said in

Melman v. Jordan, there is no question that Section 1983
covers the Supremacy Clause claim; the question is whether or
not we get jurisdiction under Section 1343.

We stress 1343

because we believe it is the narrowest argument for this Court,
as t?ais Court has held in Preiser v. Rodriquez, alternative
methods for review, take precedence over Section..1,983 cases.
We think it's kind of odd that this case does come
before this Court in the circumstances.

Here wa are alleging

n claim that has been held to be a violation of due process—
QUESTION:

Your position is that any Supremacy

Clause case is a 1983 case?

21

MR. SKARDA: That's correct, your Honor.
QUESTION: Any Supremacy Clause case raising actions
by state officials?
MR. SKARDA:
QUESTION;

Yes.
Regardless of what the underlying right

is that is involved, or what underlying claim is involved?
MR* SKARDA:

If it involves a conflict, and let me

expand on that if I may.
QUESTION: So you would say in your position that
surely if you had $10,000 in controversy, you could bring your
action under 1331?
MR. SKARDA;

That's correct, your Honor.

May I expand on your first question.

We think the

reasons that the Supremacy Clause claim is somewhat narrower
is that it is only where there is this clear conflict, such
as here between an HEW codification , this Court's decision,
and a state regulation.
QUESTION:
position.

Mr. Skarda, I am not' sure I understand your

It is for me a very difficult case because it

involves so much circularity, the arguments on both sides,
this jurisdictional question.
Let’s assume there were no Section 1983, just assume
that wasn't on the books at all.

Would it be your position

that 1343—28 U.S. Code 1343 would provide jurisdiction of this
case, since it is based upon a conflict between federal law,

22

state law, and ultimately therefore upon the Supremacy Clause?
Section 1343 says the District Court shall have the original
jurisdiction of any civil action authorised by lav? to be
commenced by any person to recover damages or to secure equit­
able or other relief under any Act of Congress—no, excuse me—
turning to (3)—any right, privilege or immunity secured by
the Constitution of the United States, and that would be the
Supremacy Clause.
MR. SKARDA:

That's correct, your Honor, but 1343(3)

also says a civil action authorized by law, and that's been
interpreted to refer back to Section 1983, for a cause of action.
QUESTION: You need 1983 for your argument?

Do you?

MR. SKARDA; We believe we do.
QUESTION:

Because only that section is a lax* that

authorizes this cause of action?
MR. SEARDA: That's our argument, your Honor.
And we of course again believe that's what the Court
found in Edelman v. Jordan.
I would like to mention that we don't think our
Supremacy Clause cases reach every possible x-zelfare case; we
are not here alleging a direct antilogy with some kind of
administrative procedure act in Federal District Courts through
state welfare clients.
QUESTION:

Apparently you don't think that the

Supremacy Clause case has to involve a law providing for equal

23

rights?
MR. SKARDA: No, that's correct, your Honor.
QUESTION:

You think the Supremacy Clause cases that

1343(3) covers include many non-equal rights cases?
MR. SKARDA:

We don’t think they include a large

number of non-egual rights cases, but we think they include
those basic cases in conflict. They would not include, for
example, just whether or not somebody w?as incapacitated were
it not for AFDC, because there would be no conflict between
state and federal law.
QUESTION:

Could you corceive of s case between

General Motors and General Electric under the Supremacy Clause
under 1343(4)?
MR. SKARDA:
QUESTION:

Not without 1983.
Supremacy 1343 automatically?

You don’t

really mean that, do you?
MR. SKARDA:

We think we need Section 1983 fonder

cover of state law7 provisions.
QUESTION:
MR. SKARDA:
QUESTION:

But you keep dropping that.
No, we think this is a 1983 case.
There isn’t a Supremacy Clause problem

involved anyway unless the states are involved.
QUESTION: That’s right, state laws and federal laws.
Usually that is a recurring instance where the
Supremacy Clause is invoked.

Usually where there’s been an

24
assertion under state law,
MR. SKARDA:
QUESTION:

We agree with that, your Honor.
But you are saying that even though

Congress seemed to say in 1343(3) that only certain kinds of
statutory claims would be vindicated, through the Supremacy
Clause you can reach other statutory claims?
MR. SKARDA:

If we have the authorised by law

provision, such as Section 198 3 here.

Now .it's interesting

in 1343(3) it does not say--it says rights secured by the
Constitution; it does not say rights secured by the 14th
Amendment or particular items in the Constitution, nor does it
limit to certain kinds of Constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

But it does limit the kinds of statutory

claims it would reach?
MR. SKARDA: Yes, your Honor, we believe it does.
QUESTION:

And yet through the Supremacy Clause

you would say you could reach any statutory claim as long as
there was a color of state law involved?
MR. SKARDA: And a clear federal conflict.
QUESTION: Well, what do you mean by a clear federal
conflict?

Clear or unclear, if there is a claim of conflict,

you'd have jurisdiction to adjudicate it.
MR. SKARDA:

We believe that it would not reach,

for example, a state law provision which is identical to the
federal law provision.

25

QUESTION: No claims just arising under, like questions
about construction or—
MR. SKARDA: That’s right.
QUESTION:

—or facts?

MR. SKARDA: For example, in our State in Texas there
is provision that they cannot delay in getting assistance?
they must provide fair hearings. We are not saying a Supremacy
Clause claim would reach those cases because that provision
happens to be identical to the federal statutory provisions
in the Social Security Act.
QUESTION:
claim?

Well, wouldn’t you have an "as applied"

In other words, even though the state and federal

claims were statutorily identical, you could claim that as
applied the state system was not delivering in the way the
federal statute required.
MR. SKARDA:

Certainly we would, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, but there is a reason why those "as applied" claims
«Ion't reach these courts, and that is because usually the states
you know, enforce their own state statutes.
QUESTION: But that’s a practical reason. That’s not
a jurisdictional basis.
MR. SKARDA: That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Have you abandoned your suggestion of a

moment ago that there has to be a clear conflict between the
state rule and federal rule?

26

MR. SKARDA: If they are precisely the same.

Unless

there was a pattern of practice which meant the state rule
even though written appears to be the federal rule? but it is
not applied as a federal rule is intended, then we think we
could make a case under the Supremacy Clause.
QUESTION:

But then in every case couldn’t you

sue in the first instance in the federal court saying you don’t
think you'd win in the state court?
MR. SKARDA:
do it in every case.

Your Honor

we don’t believe we could

For example, if it is just a clear

factual issue, no questions of policy involved, whether or not
someone is incapacitated enough for AFDC, we could not bring
that in federal district court.
QUESTION: You say as a natter of federal law you
are entitled to some kind of benefit if your client is incapaci­
tated and the state has found him not to be incapacitated
but they’re wrong?

as a matter of federal law, why aren’t you
i

still entitled to go into 1983?
MR,, SKARDA: They have the right, they administer
the program, to decide incapacity unless they announce a rule
which restricts the federal rule.
QUESTION:

They say we apply the same rule as the

federal.
MR. SKARDA: Then we don’t believe that we can get
into federal court-

MR. SKARDA:

and taking them to jail.
QUESTION;

You think it1s due to the constitutional

rule and the statutory rule, is it?
You say the test is different when itf s a federal
statutory claim than a federal consitutional claim?

I don't

follow yon.
MR. SKARDA:

We believe under the Supremacy Clause

would have to fee different from the federal rule.

QUESTION;

We believe that Monroe v. Pape' -It comes under our theory when people

are beaten when they are searched,
MR. SKARDA; It comes under our theory in terms of
"as applied."

It is a pattern that doesn't grant the rule

as written.
QUESTION; Well, 1343 independently gives jurisdiction
where the claim is constitutional, doesn't it?
MR. SKARDA;

1343, again, your Honor, 1343{3) says

"authorised by law," so there muse be some kind of cause of
action.
QUESTION;

But it gives jurisdiction over constitu­

tional claims.
MR. SKARDA; Yes, your Honor, if they are authorised
by law.
QUESTION; And if they are the kind that 1983

29

contemplates.
MR. SKARDA; That’s our position, your Honor.
Of course we would in addition say that the very
reason behind the 1871 Act, Section 1983 and its 1343(3)
successor was to reach those questions of weakening notions of
federalism.

It was a time of impeachment, there was a

Freedman's Bureeiu which provided the same kind of grant-in-aid
stuff we're talking about here, nutrition, building schools,
building hospitals.

And there was a notion abroad in the land

of the states rights to nullify.

We think those concerns

in that 1871 Act regarding the controversial provisions relat­
ing to whether or not federal officers would be free to act
in the scope of their duty from interference with state bodies
goes right back to that kind of provision in the Freedman's
Bureau where Congress was concern2d whether or not these program
could be taken out.
This Court has of coursa held in four cases, suggested
that Supremacy Clause case can be heard through Section 1343(3},
for welfare cases, Yocum v. Hiller, Hagans v. Lavine, Townsend.
v. Swank, and Carleson v. Remillard.

Also they held out a

system for deciding these cases in that line of cases such
as Perea v. Campbell, where there was interference with the
federal right to free start in bankruptcy.
QUESTION: Well, Hagans v. Levine

depended on the

assertion of a "substantial” constitution claim and the

30
statutory claim was regarded as pendant, wasn’t it?
MR. SKARDA: That is correct, your Honor.
QUESTION:

And wasn’t the issue we’re talking about

now reserved in Hagans v. Levine?
MR. SKARDA:

In Footnote 5 it was specifically

reserved, yes, your Honor, and we believe it is now open for
the Court's decision and we urge the Court to find Supremacy
Clause jurisdiction through 1343(3) in this case.
This case, we must remember, is one that can’t
satisfy the $10,000 amount requirement.

We are talking about

a difference of only about $10 in the averaging of this family
shelter allowance from $44 down to $33.84 in the flat grant
consolidation process, and a similar $3 or $4 amount in
averaging down ine utility allowance, even though it

means

$9 million benefits, of which we think at least.'60 to 65 per­
cent is federal dollars in Texas.
QUESTION:

If it did involve more than $10,000,

exclusive of interests and costs, it seems to me conceded, as
I understand it, that there would be jurisdiction under 1331.
MR. SKARDA: That’s correct, your Honor.
QUESTION: Now, why would there be?
MR. SKARDA:

Because it would- be a case of rising

under the constitution and laws. The laws provision of 1331

have $10,000.

31
QUESTION:

Do you have some cases that say the

"and laws" provision covers any kind of federal statutory
claim?
MR. SKARDA:

The 1331 cases we believe that were

cited to this Court—of course that3 s not this case—
QUESTfOn :No.
MR. SKARDA:

I'm running in my head what those cases

seem to cite.
QUESTION:
your time.

Well, never mind.

I don't want to take

I just didn't know that these had been squarely

decided here? iticiybe they have, that the "and laws" provision
of 1983 refers to any federal statutory claim whatsoever.
MR. SKARDA: Oh, no.
to 1331.

No»

I was taking the reference

No, I will address that argument at this moment, if

I may, your Honor, and of course we are making that in our
brief.

Wig believe the "and laws" provision does reach that

because there ax*e actually two references in Section 1343
to 1983, both the authorized by law provision I spoke of
earlier, and the; "and laws" provision.

We also point to the

unitary origin of 1343(3) and Section 1983.

They were origi­

nally Section 1 of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, and the fact
that the "and laws" provision is positive law which must be
heard by this Court,

In many ways it is sort of like an

analogy to a private right of act:.on but here you are doing it
only with color of state law claims.

32
QUESTION:

Mr. Skarda, on that point, when you men­

tion the two statutes are co-extensive in a sense, would you
say the words "and laws"in 1983 have the same meaning as the
words "Act of Congress providing for ecrual rights of citizens"
etc. in 1343(3)?
UR. SKARDA:

We think they do, your Honor, and

of course that’s necessary to reach jurisdiction__? whether
or not they should be read together.
QUESTION:

So then the ’and laws" provision has to

be laws providing for equal rights in effect?

Then you have to

say, do votTnot, that the Social Security Act is an Act pro­
viding for the equal rights of citizens?
UR. SKARDA:

No, v?e would argue only, your Honor,

that you have to say that 1983 is such an Act and in fact we
regard that equal rights language as a shorthand reference back
to 1983, and we have cited in our briefs some reviser arguments
that is indeed what has happened.
QUESTION: You just told me, though, that you do errnate
the words "and laws" in 1983 with the words "Act of Congress
providing for equal rights" in 1343(3).
HR. SKARDA: Yes, your Honor, we think once you get back
to 1983, you don’t carry over the equal rights limitations.
QUESTION:

They're not co-axtensive, then.

MR, SKARDA: They are co-extensive in terms of 1983 only,
We say if it’s in 1983, then it is encompassed by 1343(3).

33

Because they both started out in the same place.
QUESTION:

So then, going back to my question, you

do not take the position that the words "and laws" in 1983
are co-extensive with the words "Act of Congress providing for
equal rights" in 1343(3)?
MR. SKARDA:

No, we say that then-—

QUESTION: You say that 1983 provision is broader?
MR. SKARDA: No, we're saying that it's’—once we
get within 1983 x^e automatically-*QUESTION:

In order to get within 1983, you must

construe the word "laws" in 1983 to be broader than the
concept of laxirs protecting eoual rights.
MR. SKARDA: That is correct, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Therefore you do not take the position

that the two statutes are co-extensive.
MR. SKARDA: Well, we call it a kind of co-extensiveness,
your Honor.
QUESTION:

In a way that, it helps you, hue not to the

extent that it hurts?
HR. SKARDAs

That's correct, your Honor.

And of course our reasoning again-—where that language
carae from in the 1875 revision.

As this Court well knows, the

1875 revision wasn't particularly well laid out.

In our brief

we indicate they were simply trying to refer back and pick un
Section 1983.

34

QUESTION 2

In 1875 Congress enacted for the first time

general federal question jurisdiction,, didn’t it?
MR. SKARDA; That’s correct, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t it have been kind of strange for

them to put a $2,000 or $3,000 jurisdictional limitation
on thcit kind of jurisdiction and still have treated as broadly
as you say they do, 1343?
MR. SKARDA:

Of course 1343 only refers again to our

color of law claims, and we understand the 1875 legislation
on general federal question, that there was no discussion of
this particular point and then a relationship; that the 1875
provision is really taken out, if you would, in the absence of
any reference to 1331 jurisdiction.

And of course, regardless

of the legislative arguments, we believe that this Court’s
decision in Jones v. Mayer makes it clear that--no, excuse me-I'm talking about another—
. Let me move back, if x may, to the kinds of
cases that we have here at this tine.
is a $9 million question.
it means

I pointed out that this

I think I need to also point out that

termination from APDC assistance back in March 1973

when we filed our case, to prevent this termination of 2700
welfare recipients, of which one is in our case, the Stafford
family.

It also reduced benefits to 28,000, almost 29,000 wel­

fare recipientis.

We believe that welfare recipients in this

country need the possibility of choosing a federal forum, a

35

kind of unique forum mentioned in Hague and Mitchum

Foster,

a kind of forum which is more familiar with the tiers of
federal regulation, the capacity to read the legislative history
and have tolerance for reading the federal regulatory pronounce­
ments; the kind of forum that can offer speed and uniformity
in its decision making, and perhaps some partiality.
These are the sort of reasons addressed and the
third purposes of Monroe v. Pape, whether or not these forums
are available.
We also feel that it is not going to add a lot
of cases to the federal caseload to adopt our Supremacy Clause
argument, and sc testified as Charles Wright before Congressional
committees considering expanding, and taking the $10,000 require­
ment off 1331 jurisdiction as well as United States Court
Administrative Officer.
And finally we need ask this Court whether or not
its decision in Hagens has really worked and whether or not an
elaborate distinction between 'substantial constitutional argu­
ments and the kind of court time that has to be placed on them
is exactly what this Court intended.

That could be avoided by

deciding this case on these grounds, and if we would, we would
point to this Court’s decision, to the Second Circuit decision,
Andrews v. Maher which noted, and E quote, "We note the irony
i-’

of having to spend so much time and effort on questions and
jurisdiction;: when the underlying issues on the merits seem

comparatively simple.
Again we would ask this Court to find jurisdiction
on our Supremacy Clause arguments as well.
I would like now to turn briefly, if I may, to
the 1343(4)

claim, the allegation of conduit jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

Of course the Second Circuit rejects your

Supremacy Clause-—
MR. SKARDAs They do, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Despite its having said that.

MR. SKARDA:

And the labor of constitutional claims

of pages and pages in many decisions.
Wt§ also feel thatin a way, some of these claims
really have' to be cooked up that might debase the constitution­
ality of these claims.
In the five minutes remaining, I'd like to turn to the
conduit jurisdiction.

Petitioner points in his brief to the

fact that it is a tactical amendment.

We have discovered

and

filed a supplemental brief in this case, the green brief,
provisions where 1343(4) was intended to have much broader
consequences as envisioned by the Justice Department before
the bill was ser.t to Congress, and it was precisely to handle
these claims. Of course,only speculation would tell us what was
in the mind of Congress when it said the words "laws providing
for the protection of civil rights* including the right to vote.
We think in that speculation we should be aware of

37
the fact that in addition to our -"•sen brief and U.S. depart­
ment of Justice

memory the fact that the.Act itself spoke of

strengthening civil rights statutes.
QUESTION; Would you claim that the Social Security
Act is an Act providing for protection of civil rights or
just 1983?
MR. SKARDA;

Just 198 3, your Honor.

And of course Emmanuel Cellers9 comments also pick
up this notion of breadth of jurisdiction in the debate
in the 1957 Act.
QUESTION; In both of your arguments you have to go
back through 1983?
MR. SKARDA; That is correct, sir.

And there are

Law Review articles reading Hague v, C.I.0. and Bomar v. Keyes
cited in our brief, which deal with the gap problem between
1343 and 1983.

We think that at leeist was on the mind of

some of the participants in the 1957 Act, and of course—
QUESTION;

What did Hague y. C.X.O. decide about

anything?
MR. SKARDA;

We think Hague y. C.1.0. addressed

whether or not interference with the federal right and the
National Labor Relations Act, and of course there were dissents
on whether or not this was really a free speech and right
of assembly case, and there was Justice Stone's famous dis­
sent which has now been settled in Lynch v. Household Finance,

38

that there was a personal property rights distinction.

But

in many ways it is a kind of Supremacy Clause claim that we
are arguing here, whether it’s a federal right under the
National Labor Relations Act, and there is a city ordinance
which does not allow a discussion meeting to talk about the Act.
So we think Hague

supports our case and is an example of the

kinds of Supremacy Clause cases that we would ask the Court to
find,
QUESTION;

If you are correct, Mr. Skarda, and you

may be of course, the word "laws" in 1983 is somewhat broader
than the concept of these rights.

Does it cover every federal

statute and is it therefore unnecessary for the Court to
consider whether particular statutes like the Securities Act
and so forth imply causes of action?
MR. SKARDA;

That’s why it is somewhat broader than

our Supremacy Clause argument, but again 1983 is limited to
state action, and so it would involve only suits against the
state parties.
QUESTION:

But it would apply, if I understand your

concept correctly, to any federal rights given to an individual
citizen as against state authority?
MR. SKARDA: Yes, your Honor.
QUESTION: And you would never have to, as we did,,
for example, in the Bakke

case,

last year, consider whether or

not there was an implied cause of action under Title VI.

39

We would just rely on 1983.
MR. SKARDA:

There was a federal statute there.

Yes, and of course our reasons for that

again are historical reasons, that Congress was concerned about
notions of federalism at that time and passed the Act to enforce—
QUESTION: The fundamental difference is the
jurisdiction amount implies to suits between private citizens
and there is no reason for a jurisdictional amount when
the claim is by an individual against the state.
MR. SKARDA: Exactly. And of course 1343(4) meant
nothing in 1957;after this Court’s decision in Jones v. Mayer
it means a substantial amount for jurisdiction in 1981 and 1982
and this Court has called Section 1983 a civil rights act
in as late as Moor v. County of Alameda, and as recent as
Robertson v. Wegmann

and Monell v. New York City Department of

Social Services this last term.
QUESTION: But I suppose you would say that in view
of 1983, the "and laws" provision is right.

The laws of 1983

cover a lot of laws other than civil rights laws.
MR. SKARDA: It is broader, yes, your Honor, than the
Supremacy Clause.
QUESTION:

I wasn't asking about the Supremacy Clause,

I was asking about 1343(4). It refers to civil rights.
MR. SKARDA:

Again it is almost identical with the

"and laws" argument in terms of number of cases besause it
refers back to Section 1983, which requires color of law

40
provision.
QUESTION: I understand that.
MR. SKARDA: So they would be somewhat identical in
terms of coverage under 1983 as a civil rights statute.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know. I think there are an

awful lot of federal statutes that aren't
could be covered by 1983.

rights laws that

They wouldn't be civil rights

statutes.
MR. SKARDA: Of course we are saying—-it's been
criticized as a chicken-and-egg circular argument—all we
are saying is that 1983 is a civil rights statute.

That

sounds like a chicken-and-egg argument, but in answer I would
point out that 1983 and the 1871 Acts started together
and that, the 1334 amendment was brought in to solve some of the
jurisdictional problems and gap that had been developed
by revised

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. YOUNG:

of households.

Please remember the groupings of sizes

One to two people get $33 for shelter, three

to four people get $44 for shelter, five or more get $50 for

41
shelter.

That $11 difference between the $33 and $44 for the

Ortega household is a result of that grouping of the shelter
allowances between the various sizes of households; it is not
a result of proration.
With regard to the new H.E.W. regulations that purport
to codify this Court’s decision in Van Lare, of course those
were not available .or considered at all by the District
Court.

They were promulgated prior to the Fifth Circuit's

decision and the Fifth Circuit had them available at the time
of its decision but it had not based its decision on them and
did not cite them or

make any reference to them.

I would also point out that the state’s practice
in this regard is of long standing; it's not something that

and those regulations at all, and under this Court's recent
decision in nKorn (?) acainst Manley, the correct test to see
by what standard a state provision such as this should be tested,
is the standard that the state says it meets.
■_Korn against Manley, it was a switch

characterise it as special needs? does it meet those standards?
We characterize it and did long before Van Lare

as a needs

standard and I suggest the proper question is whether it meets

42
the criteria.
The only limit that I noted in the Respondents'
brief as to jurisdiction is put in Footnote 23, where they
say that they recognise limits on jurisdiction when Congress
specifically acts to prohibit jurisdiction, but I would submit
. y"

to the Court that that is a backwards argument.- Federal
District Courts, unlike the State District Courts in Texas
are not courts of general jurisdiction.

Federal District Courts

are only supposed to have jurisdiction where the Congress grants
jurisdiction to them.

The only broad grant I was ever

aware

of that was sometimes utilized to take jurisdiction in a wide
variety of cases was Section 10, 1 believe it was, of the
Federal Administrative Procedures Act.
interpreted, where the issue

That was frequently

was addressed at all, to authorize

this kind of test, and this Court in Calif am v~. Sanders said
no, that there is no such independent basis for jurisdiction.
That vras in part based on a statute that Congress
had passed just prior to your decision that removed the $10,000
limit for jurisdiction against federal officials.

Congress

is considering such legislation at this time with regard to the
states. It is my understanding that the House has passed
H.R, r1

which would remove it as to states.

Of course that

action of the House would be a nullity under the Respondents’
theory.
With regard to their reply brief, the real legislative

43
history is what the Congress said, not a memo dredged up from
somewhere within the Justice Department, and in that respect
it is interesting to note that when the Solicitor General
filed his amicus brief in this case, he says there was no
independent federal interest in the resolution of the juris­
dictional question.

I find that a remarkable statement,

having spent a good deal of the morning talking about the
constitutional laws in 1983. But regardless, if it were the
Solicitor General's opinion that these provisions referred to
all laws, surely he would have taken the opportunity in his
amicus brief to tell us so.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
