ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK B. KIMBERLXN. Ill, ESQ . *
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MRo KIMBERLJN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Patrick KImberlin, Assistant Attorney General
for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and It is the Commonwealth of
Kentucky which is the Petitioner in the case at bar.
The facts of this case, stated briefly, are as
follows.

On May 16, 1976, in the evening hours in the suburbs

of Louisville, Kentucky, the Respondent Harold Whorfcon entered
a fast food restaurant, armed with a pistol and a knife, and
robbed that restaurant -« the employees, and he took money from
the cash register.

While he was there, he took the knife and

cut the telephone lines.

He then left the restaurant, fled the

seen® in a 1967 blue Oldsm'oblle.

Seven days later, on the 23rd

of May, he committed yet another robbery, again in the evening
hours, again in the suburbs of uoulsville, again a fast food
restaurant; again armed with a knife and a pistol, he robbed
/

that restaurant, taking money from the cash register and fled
the scene.

Finally, again seven days later, on June 1, 1976.

h® robbed the last fast food restaurant, again in the suburbs of

4
Louisville, Kentucky, and in. the evening hours.

This time, he

pulled the telephone from the wall, fired a shot into the ceiling
and robbed a number of patrons of the restaurant, as well as fchi
employeest and again took money from the cash register.

However,

in the course of this final robbery, one of the patrons managed
to slip away and advise the police of what was happening.

Just

as Harold Whorton was fleeing the scene, the police arrived and
gave chase.

In a short while, they forced Whorton off the road.

The car he was in was a blue 867 Qldsmobile.

He got out of the

car, flourished a weapon, but dropped it at the command of the
police.

The police seized him, the weapon and some money from,

the automobile and returned him immediately to the seen® of
that last robbery, where ten individuals who had been at that
fast food restaurant positively identified him as the man who
had just victimized them.
Thereafter, the Jefferson County Grand Jury returned
three separate indictments, one for each of these three robb§r=
ies.

These indictments were joined for trial and the trial was

held in the Jefferson Circuit Court in Jefferson County, Kentucky,
in September 1977«
During the course .of that trial, the Commonwealth of
Kentucky introduced an abundance of evidence establishing the
guilt of Harold Whorton on the charges that were brought against
him.
The evidence presented by Whorton was only that of

5
his sister and his wife.

Those two ladies testified that on the

evening of one of the three robberies he was with them, thus
attempting to establish an alibi.

Harold Whorton did not take

the stand and testify in his own defense.

At the conclusion of

all the evidence.* Harold Whorton requested an instruction on
presumption of innocence»

The trial court refused the requested

instruction as per the law in the Commonwealth of Kentucky at
that time.

The jury returned verdicts finding Harold Whorton

guilty on tan counts of first degree robbery, two counts of
attempt to commit first degree robbery and two counts of wanton
©ndangermenfc.
Whorton, thereafter, pursued an appeal to the Kentucky
Supreme Court,

While that appeal was pending in the Kentucky

Supreme Court, this Court rendered its decision on May 30* 1978*
in the iase of Taylor v0 Kentucky.

Sevan days later, argument

was heard in the Kentucky Supreme Court on the casu at bar,
Whorton v. Commonwealth.
The Taylor case was before the Kentucky Supreme Court
at the time of the oral argument and they considered that course
at great length in the body of their opinion which was rendered*
1 believe* on June 25, 1978.
The opinion of the Kentucky Supreme Court resulted in
the reversal of all fourteen charges.

Two of the charges, the

wanton endangerment charges, were reversed on double jeopardy
grounds.

However, all the ten first degree robbery charges,

6
as well as the two attempted first degree robbery charges* were
reversed upon the ground of the interpretation given by the
Kentucky Supreme Court to this Court's opinion in Taylor v,
Kentucky,

The Kentucky Supreme Court interpreted Taylor v.

Kentucky to mean that a newly declared, constitutional require»
ment had been created by this Court in Taylor* and that that
newly declared constitutional requirement was that the pr@~
sumption of innocence -*» when an instruction is requested on
the presumption of innocence* it must be given.
If the request is rejected by the trial court* it is
a violation of due process of law* and reversal must be had.
At the conclusion of the majority opinion in the
Kentucky Supreme Court* it would appear that an open invitation
was given for review* if that interpretation that the Kentucky
Supreme Court gave to Taylor meant anything other than what the
Kentucky Supreme Court saw it to be.
As a consequence of this interpretation* we feel that
there has been a serious hindrance of effective administration
of criminal justice in Kentucky because* as of this time* we
now have fifty cases which wili be automatically reversed as a
consequence of the decision in Whorfcon and the interpretation it
gave to the Taylor case.
All these cases -- many of them are already reversed
or In the stages that will be reversed.
have been reversed

The majority of them

7
In addition to this case* for which the petition for
certiorari was granted her® on January 8th* we have four other
cases pending right now on petition for certiorari that have
/

already reached this Court*
Our argument is two-fold.

The first is that it is our

belief that the opinion of this Court in Taylor v, Kentucky
means that the Taylor decision is limited to its own facts and
is of narrow application* and does not create a per se consfcltutional rule requiring automatic reversal on due process grounds*
under the Fourteenth Amendment* if a presumption of innocence
Instruction is requested and then refused by the trial court.
We feel that the Interpretation that should be given
to the Taylor case is that constitutional error may occur on an
ad hoc basis* and the true constitutional principle Involved in
Taylor is not the givihg or not giving*in a mandatory sense* of
a presumption of innocence instruction* but the principle that
is constitutionally protected* that an accused in a criminal
case can be tried only on the basis of probate of evidence
actually adduced at trial and beyond the reasonable doubt.
It Is this principle with which the yue -Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment was invoked by this Court* we be­
lieve* in the Taylor case* in order to insure* in effect* a fair
and reasonable trial in the Taylor case.
And* as we know* of course* what happened in the
Taylor case was during the course of that trial many numerous

8
extraneous* negative circumstances arose -- extraneous from the
evidence* that had nothing at all to do frcm the evidence -comments made by the prosecutor in his opening statement with
respect to inferences to be drawn from an indictment which was
read to the jury* comments made by the prosecutor* in his sum­
mation* with respect to equating the status of a defendant with
that of guilt, and that all defendants who were brought to the
bar are guilty.

There were numerous comments to this effect.

Given the circumstances of the Taylor case* Petitioner
who was Taylor in that case* urged that under these particular
circumstances .in Taylor* the presumption of innocence instruc­
tion* which was requested* should have been given in order to
protect the principle that a man is to be tried only upon the
basis of the evicence introduced at trial.
Of course* this Court noted in the Taylor case that
the purpose of the presumption of innocence instruction is to
protect the principle that a man is to be found guilty only on
the basis of the proof adduced at trial and no extraneous matters.
I think also*if we go to the case of Sstelle Vo
Williams* where this Court noted in that case that the pre-'..
sumption of innocence serves the purpose — its purpose is two­
fold.

One is to remind the jury that the burden of persuasion

is with the Government and it must carry its burden of persuasion
beyond the reasonable doubt.
purging effect.

And secondly* that it has a

It can forestall the consideration by the

9
jury of extraneous matters»

_

It wag the purging effect which this Court* I believe*
felt was so important in the Taylor case.

It was necessary to

purge some of the — or all of the extraneous matters which arose
during the course of that trial»
We submit that if there are no extraneous matters
occurring during the course of the trial upon which the jury
could improperly base* or assume* the guilt of the accused*
and if their verdict is based solely upon the overwhelming
evidence of guilt properly presented at trial* then no consti­
tutional error occurs* that given certain circumstances* as in
Taylor -- given the degree of negative circumstances* as in
Taylor* and the cumulative effect of those negative circum­
stances* they can pyramid one on top of the other until there
can be a violation of due process of law* in the absence of an
instruction on the presumption of innocence.
However* we respectfully submit that in the absence
of the negative circumstances there is no constitutional mandate
that the presumption of innocence instruction* as a per se rule*
is required.
Thus* we submit that in this case there was no viola­
tion of any constitutional standard* simply because we do not
have* in comparison of the facts of this ease to those in the
Taylor case» the type of improper comments made by the prose­
cutor throughout the trial.

We do not have a situation where

10

we have a mere swearing contest; between two witnesses, as in
Taylor.

The victim there testified was the only person to

testify.

The defendant testified was the only person to testify

for the defense.
Here, we have fifteen different witnesses who posi­
tively identified the accused as the man who had victimized them
on these three separate occasions.

We have the testimony of

police officers who gave chase and apprehended hiru fresh from
the scene.
QUfiisTION:

Then the instruction on innocence wouldn't

have hurt the Government at all, would it?
MR, KIMBBRLIN:

That's correct.

It would not have

hurt the Government at all.
QUPoTXON:

Why not give it?

Why not allow it to be

given?
MR. KXMBKRLXN:

Well, .in fact, interestingly enough,

Justice Marshall, the day after the oral argument was heard by
the Kentucky Supreme Court in this case that court amended
Kentucky Rule of Criminal Procedure 9.56 and now requires a
presumption of innocence instruction.
There would be absolutely no hard, I don't feel, that
it would have done to the Government's case.
QUfiJTION:

Is this an order -«■ by an order?

MR. KIMBKRLIN:
Honor.

I agree --

This is by act of the court, Your

Justice White, our court can amend its own rules, its

11
criminal rules, and ifc has done so in this case.
QUESTION:

Do you have a copy of the order?

MR, KIMBERLIN:

Not of the order, but the amended

rule is a part of the brief in our case.
QUESTION:

That’s what worries me.

Then what do we

have before us?
MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Can we reverse that order?

MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Well, that order --

Can we touch that order?

MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Well, before this Court --

Mr® Justice Marshall, that order --

Can we?

MR. KIMBERLIN:

No, but that order doesn't affect

this case.
QUESTION:

In Kentucky, you have to give the in­

struction.
MR. KIMBERJjIN :
QUESTION:

Right, Your Honor.

Well, what is this hare?

MR. KIMBERLIN:

Because that order does not affect

this case, nor does it affect the other forty-nine or fifty cases
which were reversed before that order ever went into effect.
There is no retroactive effect.
QUESTION:

Do you have a copy of the Watson decision

here?
MR. KlMBERj-JN:

Your Honor, it is made a part of the

reply brief filed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in this case*

We chose simple

prophylaxis over Talmudic hair splitting."
And that means what?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Yes» Your Honor» I am fully aware

of what that opinion says..
That brings us to the second aspect of this case.
The underpinning of the Kentucky Supreme Court's decision in
the Whorton case is that this Court created a constitutional
requirement»under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Pus Process
Clause» that a presumption of innocence instruction must be
given as a per se matter» regardless of facts and circumstances
or anything else.

And if the instruction itself when requested

is not given» then it's a violation of the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment.

MR. KIMBERLIN:

Certainly* because it's like any

states or in the Federal Government* a change in the criminal
rule does not retroactively affect all other cases.
QUESTION:

That's true.

I certainly agree with

That rule is not before us.
QUESTION:

Well* how can we rule on it?

MR. KIMBERLIN:

I am not asking you to rule on that

rule* on the change in the rule* because this happened before
the rule ever went into effect.
QUESTION:

You brought it up.

MR. KIMBERLIN:

I brought it up to advise the Court

14

of what was happening in Kentucky0

And also I believe this.

The rule in Kentucky, before the Taylor case came down, was that
there was absolutely no necessity for a presumption of innocence

Now, I think in some cases, there would be no violatior.
of constitutional rules if you don’t have the extraneous negative
circumstances like occurred in Taylor which, in effect, infected
that man's right to a fair and reasonable trial and to be tried
only on the basis of the evidence presented.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kimberlin, may I ask

at page 9 of your reply brief, the Watson opinion,

I am looking
.jo you have

it there?
MR. KIMBJRLIN:
QU-UfcTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The paragraph at the bottom of the page.

Whatever principle of law is laid down in that para­
graph, does that apply to this case?
MR. KXMB-1RLIN:

To you mean the last paragraph in

the argument?
QIU5TION:

Yes.

MR. KIMBJRLIN:
QUESTION:

It does?

MR. KIMBJRLIN:
QUJ3TI0N:

Yes, Your Honor*, but that is --

Yes.

It does apply to this case.

Nov/, what does it mean in the second sentence, "In

15

'«/horteon# supra# we elected as a matter of state lav; not to engage
in the mental gymnastics Inherent in the application of the harm­
less error doctrine"?
MR. KIMBCRLIW:

What that means# we feel, is this.

As I said earlier# our case -- we had a two-fold approach# first
being#is it an ad hoc basis and not a per se rule?

The second

aspect of our case is if Taylor created a per se rule -- if what
you said in Taylor means that you have to give the instruction#
if you don't it's a constitutional error# then what we submitted
in our brief—which by the way was written prior to the decision
of our court in the Watson case -- was that if a per se rule is
created then the harmless error — the Court can turn to the
harmless error rule# under the Chapman and Harrington cases# and
determine it on a case to case basis.
QUESTION:

The starting point --

But# taking your second proposition# doesn't

this paragraph from Watson indicate that your Supreme Court# as
a matter of Kentucky law# has said we are not going to indulge
in the application of the harmless error doctrine?
MR. KIMBBRLIN:

As to the application of the Federal

harmless error rule# that is true.
QlLuoTIGN:

However# Justice Brennan

But it has not said that it regards it as

a per se violation of the Federal Constitution to fall to give
the instruction.
MR. KIMBGRLIN:

Oh# yes# I believe it has.

In the

Whorton case# it said quite clearly# we think# that "We interpret

16

Taylor fco mean -*>
QUESTION:

But that's what you are appealing here.

MRo KIMBERLIN:

That's right, that if this is a per

se rule, if this is a per se rule, the only hope we have is fco
apply the Federal harmless error rule.

And quite candidly, the

Watson case —
QUESTION:

This looks, does it not, as if your

Supreme Court has said if you get fco the point where there has
been a violation then it can't be saved by application of the
harmless error rule, the conviction can't be —
MRo KIMBERLIN:

They have chosen in that case -- I

agree, Justice Brennan, that they have chosen not to apply the
Federal harmless error rule.

But before you ever get to the

Federal harmless error rule, in. Chapman or Harrington you have to
have a constitutional violation,
QUESTION:

I understand.

This is your first sub-

mission,
MR, KIMBERLIN:

That's going back fco that, that in

other words you look at the case, you look at the facts of the
case in order to determine where there arenegative circumstances

But the Kentucky court has simply announced

a prospective ruling.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

That's correct, Your Honor,

It's

QUESTION:

Isn't your basic submission that Taylor was

not a per se rule?
MR* KXMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Exactly*

Yes, but don't you think -- Aren’t you

really arguing that Taylor only applies where you couldn’t
find harmless error?
MR„ KIMBERLIN:
an awkward situation.

Oh, no*

It might appear as somewhat

First, you have to look at the facts to

determine whether there is constitutional error, if this is an
ad hoc application
QUESTION:

But if there is no prejudice, there is no

error, under your reading of Taylor?
MRa KXMBERLIN:

In a sense, you could say that.

I see

what you are saying.
QUESTION:

Well, in a sense, that’s what you are

saying.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

What you have to do, we are saying,

on an ad hoc basis —
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think Taylor means?

MR. KIMBERLIN:

We think that it is not necessary to

give the presumption of innocence instruction, where there are
no extraneous matters,
QUESTION:

What does that mean?

MR. KIMBERLIN:
just said, Your Honor

In effect, I guess, exactly what you

18

QUESTION:

Yes* exactly.

To you think that's any different than saying ~
MR. KIMBERLIN:

A per se rule?

QUESTION:

X?o you think that’s any different

No.

than saying that you must give the instruction where you couldn’t
hold that it would be harmless error?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Well* what that is, of course,

assuming there is a per se rule and then applying the harmless
error —
QUESTION:

No, no —

QUESTION:

That wouldn't be the first instance in the

law in which there was a semantic doubt.

For instance, in our

(?)

Brut on case, where we held that an implicated defendant could
admit

could object to the admission of a co-defendant’s

confession against hlm„ You are confronted in lower courts now
with arguments that either there was no Bruton violation or if
there was it was harmless error.

Sometimes those are rather hard

to straighten out.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

That's right.

I understand that.

The way I would try to establish it in my own mind -I was getting quite confused and other attorneys in our office
were saying well what's the difference of approaching the facts
in the beginning and then approaching the facts in the end on the
two arguments.

And the difference, I think, is this.

If it is an ad hoc rule, then you have to look at the

19

facts to determine where there is a constitutional violation.
And if you «=•*•

Or whether there is harmless error.

If you have to do that for the ad hoc

QUESTION:

Once you decide that the Taylor rule applies*

there couldn't possibly be harmless error.
MR. KIMBSRLIN:
basis,

That 's correct* if it is on an ad hoc

Because you have to look at the facts first to determine

the constitutional violation,

I don’t think you could reasonably

look at the facts and determine there is not reversible error.
•QUESTION:

But if there is some possibility of harm •

there couldn't be harmless error.
MR. KXMBERLIN:

Well* harmless error rules have only

been applied, to my knowledge* where there is a-per se constitu­
tional rule* and a per se constitutional rule is ordinarily only
triggered by a triggering fact or a triggering fact or two.

Like

in Mirandaa if a man is arrested* he can’t be questioned unless
you give him these -- regardless of all the other facts and
circumstances -- that's the per se rule,
QUESTION:

He can be questioned all you want to ques­

tion him* but unless you obey the Miranda rules you can't intro­
duce what he says at trial.
MR, KXMBERLIN: .But after you have the per se rule*

20

then you can look to see if It's harmless,, because it doesn't
make any difference what facts went before in a per se rule,
because there is only a triggering fact.

But on an ad hoc basis

1 think you have to look at all the facts to determine whether
it has actually been a constitutional violation.
In any event, if this Court did create a per se rule,
we believe that, with respect to the second aspect of our case,
the Watson decision may very well have cut out from under us our
argument as to the application of the Federal harmless error rule,
because there is nothing in Chapman «*- and we candidly concede
this.

There is nothing in Chapman or Harrington which would

preclude a state court from refusing to apply the harmless error
rule of those two cases.

In effect, that does nothing more than

create a stricter and more narrow standard than that required by
this Court, if there is a per se rule established to begin with.
If there is not, then you don't **«
QUESTION:

Or, I suppose, if your Kentucky court had

said, "Well, as we understand Taylor, it is not a per se rule.
It's cn an ad hoc basis.

You do it from case to case.

not going to do that.

We are just

As a matter of state law, we are going to

say that if the Supreme Court of the United States wants to Inject
this kind of confusion at state trials, we are going to clear it

21

all up bys as a matter of state law*, making it a per se rule/1
That would be a matter of state law then* wouldn’t it?
MR, KXMBERLIN:

A matter of state law, but, you know,

I think this Court -- sometimes opinions are written in such an
atmosphere and I think the Taylor opinion affected the Kentucky
Supreme Court in a certain way, and I think you can see what way
it affected it by reading the Whorton opinion»
Also, I think, you can almost see a type of reaction
by the Kentucky Supreme Court in, for the first time*changing
that particular Kentucky Criminal Rule to mean the exact opposite
of what it had ever meant in the past.
And not only that.

This Court in Taylor criticized

the skeletal instruction on reasonable doubt.

Interestingly

enough, on the amended criminal rule in Kentucky now, the term
"reasonable doubt" cannot even be defined.
I think that this
QUESTION:

You don’t want us to overrule Taylor, do

you?
MR. KXMBERLIN:

Oh, no.

I don’t want you to -- I

think Taylor is a superb case for its facts* and any other cases
that come within the degree or purview of those type of facts
that establish a constitutional violation -- But I cannot believe
— and 'I guess I'll find out soon enough

whether this Court*

in Taylor* said that you have to give that instruction as a
matter of constitutional law* under the Cue Process Clause of the

22

Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

When requested.

MR. KIMBERLXN:

When requested.

If there are no more questions from the bench* that
will conclude the argument for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Very well* Mr. Kimberlin.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Fitzgerald.

Is there any question about it that the Taylor case
emphasized that it was decided on the facts of that case and that
it disclaimed laying down a per se rule?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRENCE R„ FITZGERALD * ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
t

MR. FITZGERALD:

Mr. Chief Justice* and Members of

the Court:
It is very difficult for me to tell this Court what
it meant, by its language.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I want to know what you

think it meant.
MR. FITZGERALD:

I will be glad to tell you what I

think it means.
The common sense of the matter to me is that there
are three branches to Taylor.
First of all* this Court recognized the vital function
of the presumption of innocence as a tool for the jury* and

23

therefore Imposed an affirmative duty on trial judges to give
light to the presumption for the jury.
However* at the same time, the Court exalted substance
over fora and wisely refrained from legislating form instructions
containing magic words.
To ms, the operative due process principle in Taylor
is not that an instruction containing the magic words "presumption
of innocence" must be conveyed to the jury in every case* but
rather that in some manner the trial judge must reliably convey
to the jury the substance of the presumption.
And on the particular facts before the Court in
Taylor* this Court appears to me to have held that only an
instruction would have conveyed the substance.
I submit that the Kentucky court* in Whorton* cor*
rectly discerned the principle which 1 have enunciated and
said* in effect* as applied to Kentucky cases* this means that
it will have to be given in every case because we pride our-*
selves on bare bones instructions which keep the trial court
from reliably importing the substance of the presumption to the
jury in any other way.
QUESTION:

You era talking about fhorton and not

MR. FITZGERALD : . Yes.
QUESTION:
Writ of Certiorari.

Take a look at page 22 of Petition for
The penultimate paragraph of the court's

24

Do you think you can really reconcile what you just
said with the court's statement there that "Those of us in the
majority would like to be able to hold that this newly-declared
constitutional requirement is subject to the harmless-error rule,

MR, FITZGERALD:
our case here today,

I think that's the second branch of

that the court correctly discerned a general constitutional
principle, as a matter of due process, that the substance of
the presumption of innocence should be conveyed to the jury.

about exceptions.

Whether it is subject to exceptions

I think the court said, "We are uncertain
And we are afraid that if we make an exception

it might not stick."
The court then went on in Watson to elaborate on
that fear and to explain that part of that fear is not based
on the notion that —

source that seems to be able either to construe or amend the

MR* FITZGERAID:

the language of the Supreme Court of Kentucky* but I think that
the result was correct.

They

discerned that it was unclear whether there might be exceptions.
And rather than play constitutional roulette they did two things.

But when you couple with that the

adoption of a rule of state law, which they noted in a footnote
they were doing simultaneously, I suggest that their motivations
-- although not clearly enunciated -- may have been both.
QUESTION:

But your client is Whorton, not Viatson,

right ?
MR. FITZGERALD:

That is correct.

But I would submit

that even if Whorton had said solely as a matter of federal constltutional law we hold that we cannot apply the haraless-error
standard, if the court has subsequently said — and it is a
matter of state law

that "We choose not to do so," that this

Court should not involve itself in the state process.
QUESTION:

I don't think we can, can we?

MR. FITZGERALD.:
QUESTION:

That's, what I am saying.

Well, then that would still leave the

question of -whether Taylor is a per se rule or not, would it
not, as a matter of federal constitutional law?
MR. FITZGERALD:

Yes, I think so.

However, if you

read the reluctance, as I think Justice White pointed out so
graphically during General Kimberlin's remarks «« If you read

principle by which the jury weighs the evidence.
And as Justice Wilhoyt of the Kentucky Court of
Appeals noted in his dissent in Taylor, before It ever got to
this Court, that presumption is probably .contrary to the mind­
set of many of the jurors, and they probably entertain a pre­
sumption of guilt, by the time they go into that jury room after
having heard the Indictment read, or even as they enter the
beginning of the trial.
QUESTION:

Somewhere In these papers, in one of the

the decision of a case.

QUESTION:

It's in Justice Clayton's dissenting

opinion on page 33 of the Petition for Certiorari* the Footnote:
"According to a comprehensive national survey conducted by the
National Center for State Courts"-—the actual figure is 37$ * and
that stands for --"that figure is over a third of all Americans
believe it is the responsibility of the accused to prove his or
her innocence."
That’s what I thought I had remembered.
MR. FITZGERALD:

That's what I think underscored

what this Court recognized in Taylor and Williams * that not only
must the jury be made aware of the presumption* they must be
made aware ot it reliably by the trial judge.

No amount of

31

argumenta no amount of persuasion can carry with it the weight
which the state attaches to that presumption* as an operative
principle to guide them in weighing facts during the fact­
finding process.
QUESTION:

What should we do with this case if we

say the Kentucky court was wrong with respect to Taylor* that
it wasn’t a per se rule* it was an exceptional circumstances or
an ad hod due process case?
Should we just reverse then* or —
MR. FITZGERALD:

I think you can dismiss for mootness

in light of the language in Watson* that they would not want to
engage in that kind of mental gymnastics on the front end any
more than they would on the back end.
QUESTION:

It's the same process.

Yes* but they can say that again* that we

are talking about this case* not Watson.
Why wouldn't we just reverse or at least vacate and
say* "Here’s what Whorton meant."

Maybe we can’t say what it

meant* but we can tell you that Whorton didn’t mean what you
said it meant

I mean Taylor.

"Taylor didn’t mean what you

said it meant.

And now you can do about it what you want to*

as a matter of local law,"
MR. FITZGERALD:

If this Court feels that Taylor is

strictly an exceptional circumstances case* that certainly is
a remedy available to the Court.
QUESTION:

It is available* but is that what we —

32

Let's just assume that that's what we would hold with respect
to Taylor.
What would you then argue we should do with the case?
MR„ FITZGERAIL:

I think that the circumstance of the

Kentucky court's explanation of its unwillingness to get into
a case by case approach and the adoption of the rule would still
justify this Court in upholding the decision in Whorton as —
and mooting this case,
I think it is much more likely* a much stronger case
to moot* if we are talking about a general principle subject to
possible harmless error exception.

But the circumstances of

the Kentucky court's action*summarily reversing all pending
cases* propectively imposing a mandatory duty in all future
cases* and then in Watson explaining what it has done as being
a reluctance as a matter of state law to get into case by case
evaluation* would indicate that the Kentucky court would do no
differently on remand than it did before.
QUESTION: So* I take it* you then are quite sure in
your own mind — at least you would argue ■»■=* that no matter what
we said about Taylor ~~ if we said this is not a per se case*
the Kentucky court would still leave its mandatory instruction

Mr. Fitzgerald, are the judges of the

Kentucky Supreme Court elected?
MR0 FITZGERALD:

When was the last election?

MR. FITZGERALD:
QUESTION:

I believe the elections are staggered»

Was there one in the fall of '78?

MRo FITZGERALD:

QUESTION:

Yes, they are.

No.

Mr. Fitzgerald, the issue in Taylor, really,

was whether or not there had been a fair trial, and the court
emphasized a number of factors relevant to that issue.

First of

all, the thinness of the evidence the prosecution was able to
muster.

You had one on one, nothing else.
. Then the court emphasized -- the argument by the

34

prosecutor* the closing argument which went quite.far afield.
It talked at length about the indictment and also implied that
every defendant was guilty.

In addition to that* the basic

instructions were quite skeletal.

The court's opinion examined

all of those factors and concluded* as the Chief Justice has
stated* that in those circumstances the failure to give the In­
struction deprived the defendant of a fair trial.
3o you detect any suggestion of per se rule in those
circumstances?

Why would we have gone into those?

All we would

have had to say is that whenever there is a failure to give that
instruction* in clear language* there has been a denial of due
process.
MR. FITZGERALD;

I take Taylor to mean* and perhaps

wrongly* from what you are saying, that the trial judge has a
duty to insure that the substance,

of the presumption is con­

veyed to the jury in sane manner. And the reason that these
factors were gone into* it impressed me* was to see whether it
had to be done in this particular manner, with this particularinstruction .
In Kentucky, the same skeletal instructions have been
given from time immemorial.

And, indeed, the opinion in Whorfcon

considers this Court's criticism of those instructions as a com­
pliment.

possibility.

I think it at least leaves open that

I read the decision myself, quite frankly, as

leaving for future determination whether or not there might be
a different result.
It is not uncommon, in my experience, for a court to
qualify its result and leave open for future consideration on a
better record, with perhaps more experiential data from different
states or jurisdictions which have experimented with a rule,
whether or not there are exceptions.
I could take that language to mean there are excep­
tions or I can taka it, as I did in fact, that we will leave
open for a future date discussion of whether there are exceptions.
But insofar as we are stressing the similarities
between this case and the dissimilarities between this case and
Taylor, let me point out that in this case the same skeletal In­
structions were given.

They do not convey to the jury the pre®

sumption of innocence.

They do not dispel the notion that

Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed oufc,that perhaps some 37$ of
them may have had**that he is presumed guilty.
What difference does that make, you may ask, with
so many witnesses?

I suggest that the complex nature of this

36

fifteen or more charges, rather than one or two, makes it very
difficult for the jury to sort out and to discrAminats* Ha might

presumption of guilty, is to say, "Well, let's see»

He relied very heavily upon it.

He had an alibi

to one or two of the robberies that he wanted to put on, but to
do that he would have had to testify in a joint trial as to all
three robberies#

So he had an election to stand upon his Fifth

Amendment right to remain silent and to count upon the presumption

40

to carry him through on those two other robberies.

And yet he

got no benefit from the presumption because the jury was never
told of it.

Instead they were given confusing, lengthy instrue»

tions containing the same kind of skeletal reasonable doubt in­
struction, and they went back and found him guilty, not of some of
the robberies, not discriminating from one to the other, but of
every single count and imposed the maximum penalty on every single
one.

him not guilty* ‘ The term “reasonable doubt* as used in these
instructions means a substantial doubt* a real doubt* in that
you must ask yourself not whether a better case might have been
oroven, but whether after hearing all the evidence you actually
doubt the defendant is guilty.11
I submit that this does not in any shape* manner or
form convey to the jury the presumption of innocence in its sub­
stance* but rather the opposite.

said in Taylor that due process of law requires the trial judge

process.

If the Court didn't say that in Taylor, then we would

urge that the Court should say it now, because many states which
have considered this proposition have increasingly in recent
years tended in that direction.

The reason is that it is an

operative principle fco guide the jury and it has no life whatso­
ever, unless the jury is reliably informed of it,

The only

person in a position to reliably perform this duty is the trial

Jo you have anything further# Mr. Kimberlin?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK B0 KIMBERLIN# III# ESQ. #
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Could I have just one comment?

I believe the reason the rule was amended and the
reason the Whorton opinion was written the way it was was be»
cause of the way the Kentucky Supreme Court ted it fixed in
their minds as to what the Taylor case meant.
If they didn’t think the Taylor case meant a per se
rule# the Kentucky Rule of Procedure in Kentucky would not have
been changed and this case here before the Court now wouldn't
have come out the way it did.
That's the only comment X have.
Thank you# very much.
QUESTION:

But that doesn't really follow.

Even if

it were a non per se rule# would it not still be wise for the

44

sfcate court, as a matter of state law, to lay down a per se rule
for the future administration of its own business?
MR. KIMBJRLIN:

I think#looking at it practically,,

what happened was a knee-jerk reaction on the part of the court
back in Kentucky, Your Honor,

That's why the rule changed and

that's why the opinion was written the way it was.

And that's

the way, I think, perhaps the Court should look at it.
QUESTION:

It seems to me the Kentucky Supreme Court

indicated a very definite interest in running its own affairs to
the extent it could, and it would be very likely to play down
a per se rule that it thought was wise, whether it thought it
was compelled to or not,
MR. KIMBKRLIN:

I don't come to that conclusion from

reading the language in the Vi h or ton opinion.
that they were a little bit bothered about it.

And it seems to me
I don't know if

intervention is the correct word, but they were bothered by the
Taylor opinion, very much so.

And they took it to aeon something

that it didn't mean because, perhaps, I think they reacted too
quickly to it.
This case here was argued seven days after the Taylor
opinion came down.

The rule was amended the very next day and

went into effect about twenty days later, on July 1.

The Commonwealth is entitled to

QUESTION:

By the time the case comes to the Supreme

Court, your first terminology was correct.

He stands convicted

when he comes xvifch a conviction.
MR„ KXMBCRLIN:

Well, all these cases come before the

lourt, Your Honor, now where the conviction is reversed.
If this Court reverses the Whorton case, unless there
is some other error on remand, other than this per se business
here, the conviction will then become affirmed.
QUESTION:

Your prediction is that if we reversed

and said Taylor is a totality case, depending on the circum­
stances, and the ultimate issue being whether there is a fair
trial in a particular case, as my brother Powell says, that the
Kentucky court would probably revoke this rule?
MR. KIMBRRBIN:

I don't know that they would revoke

this rule, which is a prospective effect, but as to these fifty
or more cases in the pipeline right now, many, many of them,
I feel, the convictions will be affirmed.
The Kentucky Court of Appeals, which Is a lower court
below the Kentucky Supreme Court, affirmed two criminal con­
victions, after Taylor came down, but before the decision in
id h orb on came down.

They distinguished the Taylor case.

They

didn’t think it was a per se rule at all, and they distinguished

46
it and affirmed the convictions.

And I think this is what will

happen In many of the Court of Appeals cases and the Kentucky
Supreme Court cases that have now been automatically reversed
due to what we feel is a basic misinterpretation.
Whether the Kentucky Supreme Court wants to change
the criminal rule that they amended so hastily, I don't know.
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General* can we decide what

they said as well as you can?
You are trying to tell us what they said.

We can

read that, can't we?
MR. KXMBERLIN:

Yes* I can only give my ideas of

what they said.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you one more?

MR. KJMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Certainly* Mr. Justice White.

Eo you have a list -- I take it you have

a list of the cases that might be affected* past convictions?
MR. KXMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes*

I don't want the list* but what's the

oldest one?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

The oldest one* of course* in pro­

gression in appeal/would be this one.

The most recent one is

a conviction on a murder case Where the accused got the death
penalty and it is now pending before the Kentucky Supreme Court
and will be* if things go as they are* automatically reversed.
There are twenty“nine issues in that particular case.

The first

47
one is a presumption of innocence instruction was requested and
d enled.
QUESTION;

You are talking about cases on direct

appeal?
MR. KIMBI-RLXN:

Yes.

I am talking about cases —

We've tried to delay the cases in the sense that we asked all
the procedural things» like petitions for rehearing and this and
that.

Because what has happened is we have been getting blocked

up with all these cases trying — It keeps them alive until they
get to this Court -- and hoping for a decision from this Court.
If we lose» so be it.
QUESTION;

Are there a lot of other cases that might

come up on collateral attack?
MR. KXMBERLIN:

We don't know, because we don't know

the detail of when these have come up or not, because it would
depend upon whether the instruction was requested or not.
QUESTION:

You are only talking then about X number

that are on direct appeal?
MR. KXMBERLXN:

Right.

From time to time — The

most recent case was about two weeks ago that came to our
attention.

There may be others as they come in from the state

on the process of going up in the appellate system.
When we originally pursued this litigation, we guessed
—We made a guestimate —
QUESTION:

But there may be a lot of cases that will

48
be subject to state and then federal collateral attacks*
MRo KXMBERLIN:

It certainly could be* although we

don’t know any exact number, of course.
Thank you* very much.
MR* CHI,-.]? JUisTICJ BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen*

The case Is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 2:17 o’clock* p„m.* the case was
submitted.)
