MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. GREER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GREERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
The question before the Court in this case is
whether Georgia may, consistent with the equal protection and
due process clauses of the United States constitution, allow
the mother of an illegitimate child to recover for the
wrongful death of that child, and deny that right to the
father of the child, despite the fact that the mother is
deceased, and despite the fact that the father maintained a
meaningful relationship with that child.
tod it presents the related question of whether the
present classification constitutes impermissible gender'-based
discrimination,.
The Georgia Supreme Court, in its opinion, makes
the point over and over again that the legitimate state
interests to be promoted by the present classification is
the discouragement of an illegal act.
The illegal act that classification is purported

4
to discourage is the creation and the birth of children out of
wedlock.
That illegal act has two participants, each with
an equal degree of participation, and each with an equal
degree of complicity.
QUESTION:

Would you agree that the Georgia legis™

Iciture could abolish the — all claims for death by wrongful
act?
MR. GREER;
death by wrongful acts?

That they could abolish all claims for
I would think the state of Georgia

could constitutionally do that.
And yet despite the fact that these parties have
an equal degree of participation in the act that the state
seeks to discourage, one of those parties is accorded all the
rights of a natural parent.
She is accorded all the rights of a natural parent
wit lout regard to what her actual relationship with the child
was, and she is accorded tho>se rights without the necessity of
any affirmative action on her part.
By contrast, the state has singled out the other
participant in the illegal act as the member who will serve
as the state9s means of discouraging that act.

He is accorded

none of the rights accorded a natural parent, unless he takes
affirmative action.
Appellant submits that in cases like the present

5
one that the classification before the Court constitutes
impermissible gender-based discrimination and is otherwise in
violation of the equal protection and due process clauses»
QUESTION:

Does it make any difference to your case

whether the mother is living or dead, or whether the child
ever saw the father?
MR. GREER:
amount of difference»

Your Honor, I think it makes a tremendous
Because I don't think the Georgia

legislature is obligated to absolutely guarantee the father of
an illegitimate child the right to participate in the recovery»
I think that the message of Trimble ?, Gordon and
Stanley v. Illinois and Weber v» Aetna Casualty is that a
state must carefully attune its alternatives in this area.
I think that Georgia has failed to carefully tune
its alternatives.

I think it could have a carefully tuned

statute like several other of the states have.
For example, Washington state has a statute which
establishes a preferential scheme of recovery and allows the
father of an illegitimate child to participate in that recovery
if he had done one of two things -- no, if he had done both
of i:wo things:

if he can prove his paternity, and if he had

regularly contributed to the support of the child.
Maryland has a similar statute.

Maryland allows

him to participate in the recovery if he can prove that he
either had his paternity judicially established, that he

6

acknowledged his paternity in writing, or that h© had openly
and notoriously acknowledged the child as his own during the
child's life.
QUESTION:

Is there a constitutional obligation on

every state to attune its statutes to fit every conceivable
situation that may arise?
MR. GREERs

No, Your Honor, not every conceivable

situation that may arise.
fathers

I do think a blanket exclusion of

of illegitimate children offends the equal protection

clause when a stata may carefully attune its alternatives and
still protect its interests in the area, which I think the state
of Georgia has failed to do in the present matter.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Greer, as I understand it, some

states permit different elements of damages and recovery for
wrongful death of children on the part of parents than others.
And I suppose perhaps the tuning that you’re talking
about might have something to do with what elements of damages
are permitted.
What elements of damages does Georgia permit you
to recover?
3®. GREER:

Georgia allows recovery for the value

of the life of a child.

And than it’s subject purely to the

jury’s discretion from that point forward.
QUESTION:
type of —

It could include a loss of consortium

7
MR. GREER;

It includes — instructions have been

approved which allow the jury to consider the loss of companion
ship issue.
QUESTION:

So it isn't just a monetary thing that

the child would have supplied you with so much money over the
years?
MR. GREERs

No. Your Honor,

As a matter of fact,

the Georgia legislature expressly repealed a statute in 1952
that required a contribution by a minor to the support of the
parents.
The minor child, Lemuel Parham, was born of course
to the appellant, Curtis Parham, and to Cassandra Moreen,
out of wedlock.
The child's mother, Cassandra Moreen, was killed
in the same accident which took the child's life.

And this

original action was instituted in the superior court of
Richmond County.
That court held the Georgia wrongful death statute
unconstitutional, and in violation of the equal protection
clause, and in doing so they made several findings of fact
which I think are critical to this ease.
They found that —
QUESTIONS
MR. GREER;
they were not

Ware the parents living together?
No, Your Honor, not as — no, Your Honor

8
They found that while the deceased child was an
illegitimate child, that the father had executed the child's
birth certificate at his birth, acknowledging his paternity;
that the father had paid the birth expenses? that he had
regularly supported the child from its birth until its death;
that he had at all times acknowledged the child as his son,
and was acknowledge by the child as his father.
The record reflects that the child utilised the
father's name, and not the mother's.
The court went on to find that in addition to
paying regular support, that the appellant had maintained
charge accounts at grocery stores to further provide neces­
sities for the support of the child.
And the court found finally that he had maintained
a consistent relationship of visitation, and in fact had
visited with the child virtually everyday, and had the child
for many complete weekends.
And •—
QUESTION:

Mr. Greer, let me ask you, too;

There's

a suggestion that a cause of action by the administratrix is
pending.

Is that still pending?
MR. GREER;

has been enjoined.

Your Honor, that action is pending.

It

The administratrix is the maternal

grandmother„
With regard to that point, Your Honor, I think that

9

is a point made by the appellee in the appellee's brief, is
that it is not as though there has been no provision for
recovery.
I think this Court made the point in Weber v.
Aetna Casualty that the real question — and referring back
to Levy — the real question is not whether there is a scheme
of recovery, but whether there is a scheme of recovery which
supports the mandate of the equal protection and due process
clauses of the United States»
So there is another action pending»

But 1 think

the question before the Court is whether the scheme of recovery
that exists is consistent with the equal protection clause.
Tha trial court found that —
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Are you representing the estate?
No, Your Honor, I represent the

appellant, the natural father.
QUESTION:

So you haven8t *— you're not in the

administratrix* lawsuit in any way?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
Why is that being held up pending

disposition of — this case?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Pending disposition of uhis case.
Is it agreed that — that the admini­

stratrix occupies secondary capacity to either parent?
MR. GREER:

No, Your Honor.

10
In the ease of legitimate children, she would»

In

the case of an illegitimate child, the father is blanketly
excluded from participation»
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

But why has that case been held up?
I think there would be a prospect of

an invalidation of ~ well, I can see theoretically how that
case could proceed, and the question might be, who would be
entitlted to the recovery of the proceeds „
But the superior court of Richmond County chose
to enjoin that case pending a decision in this case, for fear
that it might proceed to that trial, and the father might be
declared the proper party to maintain the action.
QUESTION:

Well, is it possible there811 be a double

recovery if you prevail here?
MR„ GREER:
the appellee has made.

Your Honor, that is an argument that
1 think it afosoitifcely i does not

exigfeo

And the reason that 1 say It does not exist is,
in Glona v. Underwriters, this Court awarded to the mother
of an illegitimate child the right t© recover for that
child0a death0
Implicit in the Court8s decision in that case
allowing the

mother t© recover was the decision that other

collateral relatives, ©r ©th@r peopl® la the statutory
scheme, would not be entitled to recover.

11
The same is true in Levy v, Louisiana,

I ft ink

implicit in that court decision that the children could
recover for the wrongful death of the mother would be a
decision that she would be entitled to recover there to the
exclusion —
QUESTION:

Well, do you think this Court goes

around awarding rights to various relatives to recover under
state statute'?
MRe GREER:

No, Your Honor, I didn't mean to

imply that, but maybe 1 didn't make myself clear enough.
1 think that a proper decision in this case would
be that the Georgia statute is not, at the present time,
carefully attuned to alternative considerations.
And that would leave Georgia any number of
options, perhaps.

I realise this Court does not award —

QUESTION?

How about the options to the various

participants in this case?
MR. GREER:

Who would get the money?

Your Honor, I think ftat in this case

the father would foe the appropriate party to prevail in this
action$ the fafter of a legitimate child is given that benefit.
QUESTION:

Mr„ Greer, in Georgia law, the unwed

father could legitimate feha child by filling a petition in a
superior court in a county in which the child was born, I think-,
Is that correct?
MR0 GREER:

Well, that is correct, and that is an

12
issue I think of paramount importance in this case, and with
the Court’s permission, I will address it now.
Mr. Justice Marshall, in a unanimous opinion for
this Court, Quilloin v. Walcott, declined to rest the decision
of that court — of this Court in that case on the fact that
the father had an option to legitimate.
He did so in that ease based on the fact that
there was some indication in the reoard that he did not know
the availability of it.
In at least two other cases ~ Trimble v. Gordon
and Stanley v. Illinois, this Court has also declined to
decide those cases, those respective cases, on the grounds
that he had an option t© legitimate.
In those cases, the argument was that there was
no insurmountable barrier to recovery; that the father could
have legitimated the child -- which is the argument made
here;

that h® could have left a will providing for the

child.
The Court ruled in those cases that the — when
attacked on equal protection gr©lands, it must survive
traditional equal protection analysis; and that the presence
or absence of an insurmountable barrier can’t alter those
considerations„
QUESTION;
t© marry the mother

Of course, in Trimbl®, the father had

13
MR, GREERs
QUESTIOMs

Excuse me?
I say in Trimble, Illinois law required

marriage as the mode of legitimating an acknowledgement.

And

that's a bit more serious than going down to the court and
filing a petition.
MR. GREER:

Yes, sir.

I do think ~ I think the

danger of resting a decision of this importance on that issue
is, well, I think it would be ironic if you have the
relationship — the degree of relationship that you have
between a father and a child in this case, and if you rest a
decision on these grounds, I think it’s ironic that Mr.
Parham in this case could havelagitimated the child, by a
naked formality, he could have had no relationship whatsoever
with that child? never supported it? never visited it? never
had any contact with it at all.

And presumptively, then,

would have been entitled to bring this action.
QUESTION:

He would have been under a legal duty,

wouldn't he, in Georgia, fe© support a minor child, if h®
were

if it were clear that ha were the father?
MR, GREER:

He is under a legal duty anyway,

without regard to —
QUESTION:
MR. GREERs
QUESTION:
MR. GREERs

Not until he's identified.
Yes, sir.

But I mean the ~

Theoretically.
““-primary support obligations for an

14
illegitimate child is placed the father»
QUESTION*
MR. GREER*

On the father.
Yes.

But it would b® ironic that h© could have
observed that formality* and fo©en entitled to recover without
regard to his relationship* and yet he has the degree of
relationship that h® has* and might b© denied that right
because he didn't observe the formality.
And X think that that argument assumes a level ©f
awareness with regard to feh© necessity and the availability
of legitimation petitions that in reality just doesn't exist.
QUESTION*

Would you be making the same argument if

the thought — if the father had not taken any part in
supporting the child?
MR. GREER*

I would never have filed a petition --

notice of appeal* if he had not had a relationship with the
child.
X doEiet have any question that the state has the
right to deny a father who has ©©ver had a relationship
with the child an absolute ~ failure to participate.
QUESTION s

Suppose you had a mother who had never

dona anything for feh© child from the day ©f birth?

She

would have a right under feh® Georgia statute fe© bring this
action* would» ®fe sh@?
MR. GREER*

Sh® certainly does.

Md I think that

15
may be another problem with the statute»

It is not one

which the issues in this case address, but I think it's
certainly — I think it is certainly a potential problem,
QUESTION,;

You mean in each case the Court has

got to inquire into the degree, how much was contributed,
what the personal relationship was between the father and
the child, in order to make the evaluation that you9re
pressing under the equal protection clause?
MR, GREERs

Your Honor, I think that -- I think in

the first instance, I wouldnet take it to a complete extreme.
I think as ihis Court said in Stanley ve Illinois, that the
constitution recognises higher values than speed and
efficiency.
I think you hs-.ve to be reasonable within that
context.

I think the state certainly has an interest to

protect.
But I think -- and the point 1 made earlier is
that I think the state has t© strive for a middle ground
between an absoluta right to recover on th© part ©f those
fathers, and an absolute exclusion ©f these fathers *—
QUESTION s

To meat — to meet what?

equal pro-»

taction?
MR. GREER;

Yes, sir, to satisfy the equal protection

clause.
QUESTIONt

What do you say is the consequence ©f

16
the certificate or the paper, whatever it was that he filed
after the child's birth?
MR„ GREER:

Your Honor, I think that in the present

case, it obviates an argument made by the appellee, and that
is, that the state has an interest in avoiding problems of
proof of paternity.
I think this case, and cases like Trimble, are the
cases which make it clear how dangerous it is to engage in
blanket exclusions.

Because in disease

where the

man executed the birth certificate, I think he obviously would
have carried his burden of proof.
And I think the state is certainly entitled to
exact a strict standard ©f proof ©n the father in these
cases, and put the

burden on him like Washington and Maryland

and California do.
QUESTION:

Could it have been any more difficult

for him to acknowledge the paternity and legitimatize tte
child at that time?
MR. GREER:

Your Honor, the point I would make

there is a point I made before, and I'd like to elaborate on
it.
1 think that argument assumes a level of awareness
about the necessity ©f legitimation that doesn't exist.
why I say that

And

the appellant Parham would be very surprised

to find that, he had to do anything to prove to the world that

17
this was his child.
The child used his nemie, and instead of the mother's.
He had gone forward on the day of the child's birth and
executed the birth certificate, acknowledging to the world
that it was his child.
QUESTIONS

Well, do you think he'd be equally

surprised to find he had an action for wrongful death on the
part of the child before h® went t© a lawyer?
MR. GREERs
QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor.
D© you think he might be aqually sur­

prised to find out that he had a lawsuit for wrongful,, death
of the child before he walked into a lawyer's office?
MR. GREERs

No, Your Honor.

I think, given the

degree of the relationship that h@ had witti his child, that
he probably expected that h© would b© tha logical alternative
to the ehiId's ~
QUESTION?

The surprise was to find that under

Georgia lav/ ha didn't?
MR. GREERs
QUESTIONS

That was his surprise.
Mr. Grear, d© I understand your e«3ll©quy

©f thel&st few minutes as suggesting that your argument here
is addressed to feh© statute as applied, a@i facially?
MR. GREER:

I think it is addressed to both.

I

think this is a particularly appropriate ease, because the
relationship that existed between the father and the child.

But 1 think it is invalid on its face, because it
blanketly excludes —
QUESTION:

Thera I don9fc understand why you

answered that had there not been evidence here of the
support of this child; you would not have tried to bring the
case ,
MR * GRSERs

1 don't think that 1 would be in a position

to suggest to this Court that a state ought fe© more carefully
tun® its alternatives if I wasn't representing a client who
would be within th©®@ carefully tuned alternatives.
QUESTION:

Well, you'd have a very hard time

proving damages, among other things, wouldn't you?

with for tire purposes of this ease.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR„ GRIER;

Counsel, you may resume,

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I had begun t© address ft® issue of gender-based
discrimination in the present ease,

And I stated previously,

there appeared to be two emerging propositions in the area of
gander'-based discrimination.
The first is that feh® elassi£ia@fei©n must support
a valid governmental objective.

In addition, it must be

substantially related to the promotion of that objective.
I think til® present classification, while it
recognises a valid state interest, that is, the promotion of
legitimate family relationships, could naver promota that
legitimate state intereste
As Justice Douglas said in S,maf it is preposterous
t© assume that people giv© birth t© illegitimate children in
conteiRplation ©f the fact that they may bs ©a@ day allowed feo
recover for their wrongful death.
As this Court stated in Weber ve Aetna Casualty,
it is illogical t© assume that pctopl? will shun illicit
relationships for fear that their children may not ea@ day
b® able to reap the benefits of a workmen's compensation law.
And as Justice Kill, in his dissenting opinion ia

22

the Georgia Supreme Court stated, the sanction employed by
the state in this eas© comes to© lata to possibly promote
the legitimate state interests,
S© 1 think it fails that emerging proposition in the
area of gender-based discrimination.
QOS STICK i

Mr. Gr©ar, before lunch you said a

state — you felt the emerging propositions required the states
to steik© kind of a middle gromd.
Supposing that thsre were a foster father of this
diiM 'm© had d®n@ everything y©«“ client has for the chi Id ,
except conceive him®

Would you think the state had to permit

him to recover under the wrongful death statute?
MR. GREEKS

¥©wx Honor, 1 think you more nearly

approach tha situation of Trimble ve Gordon there, where you
had an existing family unit, and in that situation®

It's

certainly a different question from the present me.
I think it'd be very unlikely you'd have a situation
where you would have a foster father and a natural father
both having meaningful relationships witi the child®
I think this Court has traditionally recognised
the strong interests of the natural parent in its chi Id.

&sd

1 think that should b e given soma consideration.
The m rond emerging proposition -~
QtESTIOf?:

Th® strong interest hasn't b@sn a —

strong enough to lead him to diang© ft© child's status to

23
one of legitimacy.
MR. GREER:

Your Honor, as I've said before, I think

that that argument is dangerous because it assumes a level of
awareness about the necessity of that step.
QUESTION;
lawyer

He didn’t have any trouble going to a

and getting some legal advice after the child’s

death.
MR. GREER;

Once the child, was deceased.

I think

it would normally — where apparently there is clear necrligenee,
where a person feels another person is responsible, I think
it’s not illogical that a person might consider he might be
entitled to recover for the injury.
On the other hand, in a situation where he had done
everything he knew to do to indicate to the public and the
world that the child —
QUESTION;

How do we know that?

How do we know that

he had done everything that he knew about?
MR. GREER;

Your Honor, the record establishes that

he had executed the birth certificate, that he had given the
child its name, that he had supported the child.
Those are the acts that are normally associated with
a father-son relationship.

And beyond that we get to the point

where —
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t it an equally plausible

hypothesis that he was willing to go that far, but he didn't

24
want to take the next steps to make the child legitimate
because it might increase his liabilities and responsibilities?
MR. GREER:

Your Honor, I do not think that is a logi»

cal hypothesis in the present case for the simple reason -- I
mean the appellee has made the point that maybe he provided
the support because there ware criminal sanctions if he didn't.
Well, if that’s the point to be made, then he could
have provided a minimal level of support and avoided the
criminal sanctions, but he didn’t have to go to the further
extreme of visiting with the child on a daily basis, and he
certainly didn't have to maintain additional charge accounts
for the benefit of the child , and provide additional support.
I think it8 s good faith as a parent has been
demonstrated in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

The child’s mother is dead?
Deceased, killed in the same accident

that took the life of the child.
QUESTION:

Killed in the same accident.

So ~ and under Georgia law, I suppose the child
would have been — have become a legitimate child had the
mother and father been married after his birth?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
That would have been the only way to make

the child legitimate, wouldn't it?
MR. GREER:

Could have filed a petition for

25
legitimation„
He could have filed a petition to legitimate the
child without marrying the child.
QUESTION:

To legitimate the child?

MR. GREER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

How ~ what ~

MR„ GREER:

There's a procedure, a statutory

procedure, in Georgia by which the father may file a petition
to legitimate the child if he chooses.
QUESTION:

Not

just to acknowledge paternity, but

to legitimate the child?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

To legitimate the child.
Turn the child from a bastard, to use a

correct word, to a legitimate child?
MR. GREER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I submit to the Court that the proposition stated
by the Court in Trimble and Stanley that this equal protection
question should be decided on its own merits, and not with
regard to the presence or absence of an insurmountable barrier is
still the proper way to decide the case.
If I could discuss just ~
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Did the father live with the child?
Your Honor, the record does not reflect

that one way or the other.
QUESTION:

But the father did support the child?

26
MR.. GREER:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And you said charge accounts?

What

charge accounts -—
MR. GREER:

Maintained charge accounts at grocery

stores ~~
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

In the child's name?
The record does not indicate whether

they ware in the child's name or not, but that he maintained
charge accounts utilized for the additional support of the
child.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

But they did not live together, did they?
No, sir, they did not.
Does the record state why?
No, Your Honor, it does not.
Or whether she married somebody else?
No, sir, Your Honor, the record does

not indicate whether she was married to somebody else.
QUESTION:

But I suppose under Georgia law, had she

been married to somebody else when the child was born, it would
have been her husband's child, at least by presumption?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Mr. Greer, before following up on one of

Mr. Justice Rehnquist1s questions about the relationship,
supposing that the legislature had made a.study of the problem
that this case illustrates and found that in about 94, 95

27
percent of the cases that the fathers were unknown and
unidentified? about 5 percent of the cases, the fathers did
legitimate the child? and there are only a handful of cases,
like this one, where the father of an illegitimate child has a
meaningful relationship with the child?
Would you say the statute was unconstitutional
or not?
MR. GREER:

Your Honor, that is the final point that

I had hoped to address before I sit down.
the second area that this Court

--

And that gets into

the terms that this Court

has talked of, and that is, the area of engaging in overall
generalisations with regard to proclivities and tendencies
of the sex.
QUESTION:

And supposing it's overbroad to the

extent that two percent of the cases that are subject to the
statute?
Is it unconstitutional or not?
MR. GREER:

I think if there were statistical

indications to that regard, I think it may still be
unconstitutional«
I think the Court does not
QUESTION:

Supposing this is the only case that

this situation happens in?
MR. GREER:
is, Your Honor.

Is it still unconstitutional?

As applied to this appellant, I thinkit

28

I don't think the Court needs to reach that point,
because the present —
QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that that's not the

fact?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Well, the point —
It certainly is rather unusual for the

mother and the child to be killed in the same accident, and
then have the father both be the father of an illegitimate and
one who has a meaningful relationship with the child.
MR. GREER:
statistics, if they

I think in reality, Your Honor, that the
were available, would be shocking.

I think they would reveal that some illegitimate
children are raised by their mothers? soma are raised by
collateral relatives? some will be raised by grandparents?
some will be raised by neighbors and friends —
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

But we really don't know, do we?
No, sir.
Supposing the legislature thought they

were at the case — the one I described for you?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?
Supposing the legislature assumed,

perhaps incorrectly, that if a study were made, it would
show the figures I described?
MR. GREER:
QUESTTON:

I think the ~
Would the statute be unconstitutional?

29

MR. GREER:

In the first instance, I think there’s

nothing to indicate that the legislature or the supreme court
had at its disposal any statistics even approaching that regard.
I think the statistics ~ the empirical data in
support of the propositions in cases like Califano v. Goldfarb,
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, were much more compelling than what’s
been offered here.
All that’s been offered here is the generalization
by the Georgia Supreme Court, unsupported by any statistics —
QUESTION:

But there’s one difference, and that is,

you in effect conceded in the cases that where the father was
unidentified and had no relationship, there would be no —
nothing unconstitutional about denying recovery.
MR. GREER:

I conceded, that a statute which provided

for an effort in that area would more nearly comport with
reality and the equal protection and due process clauses,
because it would more nearly comport with reality, because in
those cases where he could not prove his paternity, or could
not prove contact with the child, then the state could
justifiably exclude him from participation.
QUESTION?

Well, doesn’t -- don’t you have to only

answer that in a sex discrimination case where the basis of
review, I take it you urge, is somewhat above the mere
rationality standard, that administrative convenience

just

isn’t — at least if it -- at least if it's not much -- very

30

burdensome to individualize, that the state shouldn't be
permitted to individualize?
MR. GREER;

That has been the position of this

Court

as I understand it, that administrative convenience dis not a
sufficiently legitimate state interest to warrant total
exclusion of a class.
QUESTION;

What if the mother had been

.killed in the

accident — had not been killed in the accident, but she
survived?
I take it it would be your position that the mother
and the father would share
MR. GREER;

in a claim for death.

X think the Court may one day be

confronted with that question in the area of legitimate
children, where Georgia prefers mothers over fathers in the
area of legitimate children? Georgia does.
The majority of the states allow the mother and the
father to share in that recovery.
QUESTION;

And you would claim here if she survives

from the accident, she could intervene and share?
MR. GREER;

If he could prove — X think a statute

like Maryland8s or Washington's is desirable where they
require him to prove more than the fact that he6s the father?
that he needs to establish a paternity and a -QUESTION;
statute..

No, X9m not atalking about some other

X°m talking about the statute of Georgia as it is

31

today.
Would you claim that the mother and the father would
have to share?
MR. GREER?

Under the facts of the present case, I

think that would be the constitutional answer.
QUESTION?

Then ~ but if the mother and father were

married, and the child were legitimate, they would not share,
under Georgia law, would they?
MR. GREERs

Under Georgia law as it presently

exists ~
QUESTXONs

The mother gets it all.

MR. GREER:

Well, I think it should

be that way in

both cases.
I certainly think it should be that way with
legitimate children.
QUESTION s ' Either way it should be the same?
MR. GREERs

Yes, sir.

And as a final comment before I conclude, I think the
kind of generalisations the Georgia Supreme Court engaged in
are the kind that this Court has traditionally not tolerated?
the generalizations

like the father of the child who does

not take the trouble to legitimate the child suffers no real
loss when the child was killed.
And I think the present facts illustrate the fallacy
of that argument.

The overbroad generalization that itsa the

32
father who has control over whether a legitimate family unit
will exist.
That almost assumes that the father of an illegitimate
child could force a marriage with the mother if he wanted to.
Unlike Califano and other cases, those propositions are not
supported statistically in any regard, and I don0t think they
can justify the present classification,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr, Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. MONTAGUE MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE.
. ‘V.

MR. MILLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This is perhaps one of those unusual cases where
insofar as the appellee is concerned, the defendant in the
lower court, it really makes no difference to him whether he
wins or ©loses before this Court,
The facts, I think, in order to clarify the reason
for a lack of evidence in this case, is that the defendant
was sued by both the father ©f the illegitimate child,and by
the grandmother as administratrix of the estate.
QUESTION;
MR. MILLER;
QUESTION;

Mr. Miller, X8m not ~
No, sir.
~ X9m not sure I understand your

disavowal that it makes no difference.

33

Are you conceding liability to someone?
MR. MILLER:

May it please the Court,, I think that

that will be the net effect.

The mother’s case has already

been settled, because there were no hindrances in that action
as there are here, and there will be, if this Court

rules the

statute to be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

So there would be settlement then, as I

understand you, either with the administratrix or with the
father, if he should prevail here?
So it doesn’t make any difference? this is your
approach?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir, that’s my approach here.

Of course, as a lawyer having to practice in the
state of Georgia, I would defend the statute vigorously.
I think that it’s difficult for a court sometimes to under­
stand the problems that we havein the area of illegitimate
#

children with fathers who cannot be located.
And I think that there is a real state interest to
be protected by the state of Georgia in passing the act which
they did pass.
■

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that we affirm, is Georgia

law clear that the estate has a cause of action?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir,, code section 105.1309

provides that.
QUESTION:

But there’s no windfall to your client?

34
MR. MILLERs

There's no windfall whatsoever.

And

the measure o£ damages, may it please the Court, is the full
value of the life of the decedent without deducation for
necessities, whether that be for an adult, an illigitimate
child, or a legitimate child.
The measure is the same.
QUESTION:

What could the recovery be for the

estate?
MR. MILLER:

The recovery for the estate would be

the full value of the life of the decedent without deduction
for necessities, as set forth by the minds of an enlightened
and impartial jury.
QUESTION:

You think that's the same measure as

might be available to a mother?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

It is the same measure in writing.
Even though the -- even though the

mother ~ suppose both parents were dead, but there’s a cause
of action available to the estate of the child.

Or -- it

stated the mother, is that it?
Which estate are you talking about?
MR. MILLER:

X8m referring, Mr. Justice Whit®, to the

estate of the child, in this instance.

But the point I was

attempting to make is that the measure of damages is the
same, whether the suit is by a mother for the death of a
child, or by a father for the death of a child, or by the

35
administrator or administratrix for the death of a child? or
for a grownup, for that matter»
QUESTION?

So it isn't — so the major damages when

the mother is suing is not the pecuniary value that the
continued life of the child might mean to her?
MR» MILLER?
QUESTION?
jury,

No, sir,
But you would have a tougher time with a

would you not, if neither parent were alive, simply

having a court appointed administratrix testify —
administrator testify, than if you had a live mother or
father as — when you’re testifying on the issue of loss of
the value of companionship?
MR. MILLER?

Mr. Justice Fehnquisfe, I certainly

can't deny that that is a problem which would present itself,
but likewise I cannot deny that when a child is dependent
upon a parent, that increases, perhaps, the value of that
child's life.
I don't see how you could ever get around that.
And I think it makes a difference whether a child is 7 or
21, or whether the mother and the child had a meaningful
relationship? any number of other things which could throw
some light on the value of a person’s life.
QUESTION?

Well, lots of children have a more

meaningful relationship with their parents when they're 7
when they're 15?

36
MR. MILLER?

Yes, sir.

Again, I think that the Coart should understand the
posture in which the case got hare.

And that is that the

defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in the pending
action.

And that motion for suinmary judgment by the defendant

was opposed by an affidavit by the father of the illegitimate
child.
And those are also the facts that happen to be before
the Court.

So there may be some facts that the Court has

inquired about that no one knows because the superior court
of Richmond County held that th® affidavit of the father as to
these facts were taken as true, and therefore rendered its
decision based upon that.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Miller, I take it under Georgia law,

the father is not an heir of the deceased child.
MR. MILLER?

Mr. Justices Blaekmun, I think that that

is a correct statement, and I think that it is also correct
that the mother of an illegitimate child is not — does not
inherit.
And I think that is the better question which should
be brought to this Court for the decision, and that is, who
are the heirs at law of a person who is illegitimate?

And

I think that that would eliminate an awful lot of problems
that would be brought forth in the event that this Court would
hold the Georgia statute unconstitutional.

37
Because eventually, you will find that if this
statute is unconstitutional, than of course the right of
action of the mother is unconstitutional? perhaps the right of
action vested in the mother of a legitimate child to the
exclusion of the father is unconstitutional.
Then we don’t have any rights of action for wrongful
death in the state of Georgia, because they're all based
thereon.
QUESTIONS

It would be a windfall?

MR. MILLER?
QUESTION:

Yes, it would be a windfall then.
Until the legislature got busy.

MR, MILLER;
would be awhile.

Well, they don’t have much time.

It

They’re only in session for 40 days, and

they have begun, and they’ll finish in January, first part of
February.
I think that in this case that we should think for a
minute about not only the problems thatmight be caused, but
by the manner in which the state of Georgia has rtreated
illegitimate children.
Georgia by statute has allowed a father to file a
petition to legitimate the child, and it’s a very simple
matter.

It’s simply a petition brought in the county where

the child resides, stating that he is the father, and h@ can
have the child assumehis name is he so desires.
It’s not a very difficult thing.

And I think to

38
decide a case based on the level of awareness that-might
exist through the citizen9s estate for a law that has been
on the books now for 92 years, and has never been challenged
by anyone, father, mother or otherwise.
So it must be a very unique situation, and one which
I would submit to the Court would allow tha state to proceed
as it did and to hold that this particular statute is
constitutional.
It was passed in 1887, and amended one time in
1952.

Prior to that time, of course, there was no cause of

action for wrongful death by common law.
QUESTION:

Is there any particular reason — I

notice your co-counsel is from ~ your opponent is from
Carrollton, which I gather is in western Georgia, and that
this suit was filed in the Richmond County Court which I
gather is Augusta.
Is there any venue provision that9s involved there?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the

suit must be brought in the county of the residence of the
defendant if he is a resident of the state where the
accident occurred.
So that was his only venue.
We also, in the codification of the laws, have
stated on numerous occasions in the statutes that there ears, be
no discrimination on account of a parson being illegitimate?

39

that there can be no defense of a child being illegitimate
in an action brought by th© mother, whether in her own right
or in a representative capacity, or as the mother? and that a
mother can proceed to file an action and collect the proceeds
arising out of the death of her child, natural child, whether
it be legitimate or not*
I can find no reason to vary from the most resent
decision of Lolly v„ Lolly or the Quilioin decision in arriving
at the constitutionality of this case»

And the Quilioin v.

Walcott, the options that are available ~ and were available ~
to this father, putative father, are the same.
And Mr, Justice Marshall, writing an unanimous
opinion of th© Court, stated that necessarily

it existed that

the father could have brought a petition to legitimate the
child, and therefore obtained a veto right over the adoption of
the child»
And I would think that it must be that the interest
of the father in being able to veto the adoption of a child
would far outweight the right of a father to bring an action
for damages for th® death ©f a 7-year-old child»
It is incomprehensible t© met that that would not be
true.

And this Court held that Esine© that was som® middle ,

ground that th® father could take, that is, between ©delusion
and a case-by-case method, or in the Trimble ease, having t©
marry the mother, that he could in this instance bring a

very informal petition and legitimate the child, and thereby
could have obtained the veto rights to the adoption.
QUESTION;

Well,, Mr. Miller, do you represent the

maternal grandmother in this case?
MR. MILLER;

No, sir, I represent the defendant.

The

maternal grandmother is -the other plaintiff.
QUESTION:

She is the other plaintiff whose action

you said was proceeding?
MR. MILLER;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,
tod you represent the defendant who is

being sued for negligence as a result of the wrongful —■
claimed wrongful death?
MR. MILLER;

That's correct.

In the Lolly case, of course, this Court again held
in looking at the New York statute — Mr. Justice Powell
writing the decision — that the father, putative father, could
have in that instance brought & petition — I think it would be
a petition -- to legitimate the child by simply during his
lifetime acknowledging the child, and thereby the child would
have been able to inherit from the father's estate.
tod although the decision was 5 to 4, I submit that
the rationale there is the same as exists here in that the
interim step was also available to the father.
QUESTION;

Mr. Miller, are you sometime going to

tell me why that's a value to the state?

41
MR. MILLER?

Of value to the state, In my opinion,

Mr. Justice Marshall, it is of value to the state in that we
are able to dispose of litigation without having to look for
parents.
And I realize that while it might appear that this
Court has rejected that before, X think that it is now a
valid argument.
QUESTIONs

Well, that would be a valid interest if

this were a question of whether or not an illegitimate father
could inherit or something like that.
But you don't have to look for parents.

That is correct.

But it is not unusual in our state to have more than
one person, and sometimes several, making claims to one source.
And what it means, just very practically, is that you cannot

QUESTION?

But in this ease, the father gave his

own name to the boy?
MR. MILLER?
QUESTION?

That9s the way the record appears.
Well, that's the way the record is.

MR. MILLER?

Yes, sir.

What happened -QUESTION?

So the state didn’t have any trouble

there, did they?
MR, MILLER?

The state would not have had, I do not

think, any trouble —
QUESTION?

And you wouldn't either, would you?

MR. MILLER?

I don't think I would have any trouble

locating this man.
QUESTION?

So why the necessity of going through

this petition business?
MR. MILLER?

Because, Mr. Justice Marshall, I

think that what you do if you rule the statute unconstitutional
that you would have to extend some laws t© say that this was

43
a formal acknowledgement, and a formal acknowledgement is all
that's necessary.
Now what happened is simply that either the mother ©r
the father signs a birth certificate.

And that's all that

happened? the father signed the birth certificate.
QUESTIONS

Well, I thought the father here got the

birth certificate.
MR. MILLERs

No, sir, the birth certificate, as

Your Honors know, have been issued routinely, as a matter of
law.
QUESTION s

But I thought the counsel said the father

was the one who went to obtain the birth certificate?

Isn't

that what this record says?
MR. MILLERs

I cannot answer that yes or no.

But I

think the state is, by law, has placed the burden of obtaining
birth certificates not on the parents, but rather on the
hospital or the physicians that deliver the child.
And I would like to answer your question no, because
I don't recall it being that way.

But I would be presumptuous

to do so.
QUESTIONS

I have a little difference in incentive

here as compared to the inheritance eases, don't you?
In the inheritance eases, it9s generally the
illegitimate child whose striving to show paternity.

tod

here it's a little bit like "the unknown aheirs of property

44

on which oil is discovered*

Yon conceivably have the incentive

in the illegitimate -- the parent who fathered the illegitimate
child, rather than in the illegitimate child.
MR. MILLER:

That's correct? I agree with that.

But with a pool of money comes perhaps more than on©
putative father, and therein lies the real problem.
QUESTION:

There may be more than on© unknown heir

at the wellhead where -the oil is found.
MR. MILLER:

Yes, and as each well is struck, the

heirs generally com® forward.
QUESTION:

On page 4 of the appendix, it says the

MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir, he signed the birth

Either the mother or the father sign the

birth the certificate.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

It said the father did.
Yes, sir.
Wall, what else did the state need more

than that?
MR. MILLER:

What else did the state need more than

that?
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir.
The statute says that he has a right

to legitimate the child, and I don’t think the state of
Georgia has to acquiesce and say that that is sufficient

acknowledgement of the child to make the child no longer
illegitimate.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLERS
QUESTION:

Well,, he admits it's his child*
Yes, sir.
Under Georgia law, that does not make the

child legitimate? is that —
MR. MILLER:

No, sir, it does not make the child

legitimate .
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

He must file a petition?
Or marry the mother.

Either/or.

Well, why do yon think ha went to that

trouble of executing it?
Just for the sake of writing a piece of paper?
MR. MILLER:

No, sir, I doubt that very seriously.

I think he probably loved the child.

I have no doubt about

that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, did Mr. Greer tell us that

the Georgia law requires unwed fathers to support their
children, regardless?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir.
How does Georgia go about locating them?
They do not locate them.

They leave

that either to the child or to the mother to bring that
action.

It is a criminal statute, also, but I^ve never heard

of that being applied by the state unless it was to recoup

46

some benefits that had been paid, or an action was requested
by the child or the mother,
And lastly, I think that I wanted ~ a point that I
wanted to cover is that 1 know of no way, really, that a
mother can legitimate a child,
I do believe that if that were true, there wouldbe
vary few cases in which a child would remain illegitimate,
I think on some occasions, certainly, a mother would not
want to legitimate a child.
But if it didn’t require her to marry the father,
but simply to legitimate the child, I’m sure that there would
be no illegitimate children, and therefore, no problems that
we have today in this particular action,
I submit to the Court that there is a rational and
reasonable state interest to be protected, and I submit that the
vague generalities of equal protection and due process do not
require that each case be decided on its merits, which would
be certainly not required, and that they can do as they did
in enacting this statute, and provide that the father could
recover for the death of the child if he married the mother
or filed a petition to legitimate the child.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Miller.

Do you have anything further, counsel?
MR. GREER:

If I may be permitted?

47
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Very well.

You have

three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. GREER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GREERs

Counselffor appellee makes the point

that these facts may be subject to speculation with regard
to the relationship between the father and the child, because
they were only documented in an affidavit.
What counsel for appellee does not point out is that
it is a matter of record in this Court now that that affidavit
and every other pleading and every brief that's been filed in
this case was served on the maternal grandmother throughher
attorney for the express reason of giving them an

opportunity

to contest those facts if there were any -- if they existed to
the contrary.
There has been no effort to intervene in these
proceedings, although under Georgia law they are fully
entitled to do so.

There8s been no response to the affidavit,

no response to the brief in the Georgia Supreme Court, and no
response to the brief in this court.

And they were served

with all those documents.
Appellee asked the Court to affirm the decision of
the Georgia Supreme Court relying on Qailloin v, Walcott.
I think that that case is distinguishable in several regards.
I think the relationship between the father and the

48
child there was sporadic, number one.
Number two, the father there was accorded at least
a hearing»

The stata properly applied the best interests ©£

th@ child test, and the father lost in that hearing.

He has

not even a —
QUESTIONt

Would it make any difference to yeur case

if tha father had never seen the child after the child's birth,
having filed — hadn't done anything about the birth certificate?
On your equal protection argument?
MR, GREERs

On the equal protection argument?

Yes,

Your Honor, I think it does «— well, I think -- the whole
point -- I hate to be redundant — is, that I think the failing the failure of the state of Georgia is the failure to recognise
a middle ground between what Your Honor talks

about and total

exclusion, total exclusion and the absolute right to recovery»
I think that's the failure,

I think the Court in

Quilloin was distinguishing between tha rights of the father of
®.n illegitimate child and tha -- of a divorced father.

I

think arguably it might promote the objectives of legitimate
family relationships there.
But here the present classification distinguishes
between two participants in an illegitimate act, purportedly
to discourage that illegitimate act.

And I fail to see how it

could ever, ever promote that state interest that it serves.
Is the time -•» the red light, okay.

49
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

The red light will tell

you.
MR. GREER?

I think the — there was an implication

made by counsel for appellee that these fathers only come
forward when there8s monetary advantage involved.

I think

that8s another overbroad generalisation that8s not supported.
This father didn’t do that.

He was a father t© this

child from the beginning to the end,, and I think that warrants
some sort of deference, and I think that5s been the message of
this Court.

I thank the Court for the privilege,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen,

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at Is33 o’clock, p.ra., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
