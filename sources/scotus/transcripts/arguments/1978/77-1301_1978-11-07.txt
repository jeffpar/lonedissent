MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 130.1, Gannett Company against
DePasquale.
Mr. Bernius, you may proceed whenever you're ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. BERNIUS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERNIUSs

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
I represent petitioner, Gannett Company, Incorporated,
which seeks reversal of the New York State court of appeals.
The question presented by this case is what
restrictions do the First and Sixth Amendments place upon a
trial judge who rejects the public and press from a traditionally
public suppression hearing in order to prevent press publication
concerning that hearing.
QUESTION;

Do you place your argument principally

on one amendment as against the other?
MR. BERNIUS;

Your honor, I believe our argument

is based, first, on the First Amendment; secondly, on the
public trial clause of the Sixth Amendment.

They are two

separate grounds.
QUESTION;

Which do you prefer?

MR. BERNIUS;

I prefer neither, Your Honor.

they're both equally important.

I think

I think the damages in the

4
First Amendment aspect are clear, as are they in the Sixth
Amendment.
The facts in this case are very brief.

The case

arises out of the disappearance in mid-July, 1976, of a
Rochester man while fishing on the Finger Lakes in New York
state.
Respondents Greathouse and Jones were subsequently
arrested for his murder.

In November, 1976, a suppression

hearing in the case was commenced before Judge DePasquale in
the Seneca County court, located approximately forty miles
from Rochester.
At the beginning of the hearing, the defense
attorneys requested that the public and press be ejected,
and that evidence which might or might not be admitted into
trial would be heard at the hearing.
Judge DsiPasquale, with no inquiry or argument, and
without hearing any evidence whatsoever or making any
i

findings of fact, ejected the public, ejected the press —
QUESTION:

Incidentally, is there a transcript of

what happened?
MR. BERN!USs

Yes, Your Honor.

At pages 4 through 6

of the Appendix is the transcript of that ejection.
QUESTION:
the — after the

Then was there a transcript made of

ejection, of the proceedings following?

5
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

That transcript's not here?

MR. BERNIUS:
Court, Your Honor.

I believe so» Your Honor, yes.

It is not in the record before this

It was released after the defendants

pleaded guilty, which was subsequent to the time that this
initial proceeding, prohibition of mandamus, was commenced.
QUESTION:

Did the trial judge at the time of his

original order indicate that the transcript would or would not
be available

when the case was terminated?

MR. BERNIUS:

Your Honor, at the initial ejection,

there was no colloquy at all concerning the availability of the
transcript in the future.
During the hearing, the reporter, the Rochester
newspaper reporter who had been excluded asked for a postpone­
ment in order that attorneys might appear and argue.

That

postponement was denied, and the hearing finished in secret on
Priday afternoon.
On Monday morning, attorneys appeared for Gannett,
sought vacator of the court order of closure.

And at that point

since the hearing was over, we asked for access to the
transcript.
Judge DePasquale heard argument on our motion, but
denied vacator of the order,

and also denied us access to the

transcript in perpetuity.
After the plea of guilty, he had a change of heart

6

and released the transcript to the public, which was
QUESTION:

Has it been lodged with us, Mr. Bernius?

MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

No, it has not, Your Honor.

Your entire record has not been lodged

here?
MR. BERNIUS:
appendix.

Your Honor, the entire record is in the

The transcript of the suppression hearing was not

part of the record in the appellate division or in the court of
appeals.
This is a separate proceeding distinct from the
criminal proceeding.
QUESTION:

There was a separate proceeding —
What we're after is to know the entire

record isn't here?
MR. BERNIUS:

The record of the criminal case is not

before this Court.
QUESTION:

The record of the trial.

MR. BERNIUS:

Of the — well.

The suppression hearing

is not —
QUESTION:
began.

He entered a plea:.

.A trial at some stage

I'm trying to separate the pre-trial from what he

decided to do finally, which was to plead guilty, wasn't it?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

There was no

trial.

Pre-trial covers all of the things you've

been telling us about on the exclusion of the public.
MR. BERNIUS:

Yes

7
QUESTION s

Whan you say that this was a separate

proceeding, you mean that Gannett*s proceeding to obtain a releas*
of, oz access to, the suppression motion v;as in, under New
York law, a separate proceeding from the criminal?
MR, BERNIUS:
essentially two things.

Yes, Your Honor.

What happened was

We ware notified about this situation

immediately —- or shortly before the suppression hearing in the
criminal case.

And that was on a Friday afternoon, and this

was an outlying county.
On Monday morning, I essentially appeared as an
interested party, or as an amicus, in the criminal case.

I went

back to Judge DePasquale to ask him if he would change his mind.
He did not, and he denied our motion.
The next day we started a separate, distinct civil
proceeding on prohibition in mandamus in the appellate division.
3o this is an appeal from —
QUESTION:

And the case we have here, Gannett •— the

plaintiff in this case is Gannett.
MR. BERMIUS:

!

That’s right, Your Honor.

It's Gannett

against the ~
QUESTION:

It's not the criminal case.

MR. BERIIIUSs

It’s a civil case in the nature of

prhibition in mandamus challenging the orders in a criminal
case.
QUESTION:

What did you make part of the record in

that application?
MR. BERNIUS:

The — we — this case started, Your

Honor, with the petition which is — appears at page 21 — page
19 of the appendix.

And the petition challenges the orders in

^he criminal case, which were issued by Judge DePasquale.
QUESTION:

And attached to it are the exhibits

MR. BERNIUS:

Well, yes, the orders and the transcripts

of the criminal proceeding were attached as exhibits in the
writ of prohibitione
QUESTION:

Incidentally, I take it this was a

stenographic transcript, not a. tape recording.
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

That6s right, Your Honor.

The proceedings start at 13 on your case.

That's all we have on proceedings, right?
MR. BERNIUS:

Well, what is happening with this

appendix, Your Honor, is that things have been put in a
chronological order.
QUESTION;

The transcripts of the —
Is there anything — what happened with

the motion other than on page 13?
MR, BERNIUS:

No.

At the time we started this,

that was still secret and it was sealed.
When Gannett commenced the separate civil proceeding
in mandamus in the appellate division, next to those papers
were the newspaper articles which had appeared prior to the
closure,

9

Now those articles are irrelevant to justify the
closure.

Because they were not before Judge DePasquale.

He did not consider them.

And indeed, no reference was ever

made by any of the respondents to those articles.
But I would submit that those articles are directly
relevant to the issue before this Court, because they demonstrate
and put into a factual context the opinion of the court of
appeals.
The articles appeared before a course of approximately
two and a half weeks, from the time of the disappearance of
this man, until the time the defendants were arraigned on
the murder indictment.
They appeared on seven days out of that eighteen day
period, and they appeared contemporaneously with the major
events in the criminal investigation,
There were articles in morning and evening papers
when this man disappeared.

There were other articles when the
/'

..."

defendants were arrested, when they were indicted, arraigned,
and so on.
The last articles to appear were at the time of the
defendant's arraignment, which was 91 days before the
commencement of the suppression hearing.

There was no further

publicity in that interim period.
QUESTION;

Suppose in the criminal trial, Mr. Bernius,

the — either the prosecution or the defense wants to take a

10

deposition of an absent witness, either out of the United
states, or situated in some way where attendance, personal
attendance can't be compelled,,
- Would you think the Sixth Amendment and the other
arguments would require that the taking of testimony of that
witness be a public, open hearing?
MR. BERNIUSs
I do.

A criminal trial, Your Honor?

Yes,

And I think -QUESTION:

No, not a criminal trial.

I very carefully

said, before trial, pre-trial.
MR. BERKIUS;

In a criminal proceeding, yes, it would

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

What if it's never offered in evidence?

MR. BERNIUS:

Well that is, I think, irrelevant.

At the time of the proceeding, if that deposition has all
the characteristics of a criminal trial, I would assume that a
/

witness is going to testify, the parties are present, there
is an oath, there is cross-examination, the defendant has a
right to be present.

All the characteristics of the criminal

trial itself, the post-jury criminal trial.
QUESTION;

Is it not common that in pre-trial

depositions, both in civil and in criminal cases, parfciculary
if no judge is present — and that's usually the case

that

there are many questions which are asked and answered with
the reserve right to challenge their admissibility at the —

11
when* as and if the position is offered? is that not so?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION?

Yes.

Then how is it part of the trial until

it is offered in evidence?
MR. BERNIUS;

Well* Your Honor* it is an important

stage in the process* and there is a development — an
adversary proceeding to develop the factual record upon which
a subsequent determination be made.
QUESTION2

Well* will a subsequent determination be

made if it's never offered?
MR. BERNIUS?
QUESTION?

Yes.

What will there be for a court to rule on?

MR. BERNIUS?

Well* it won't be made based on that.

But there is no guarantee — and I think the analogy to a
suppression hearing i3 clear* that at the time of the suppressior
hearing* there is no guarantee at all, or no — that the
evidence will in fact be admitted at trial.

In fact* there's

no guarantee that there will be a trial.
But nevertheless* that could well be the critical
stage in the process.

But if the testimony* if the suppression

hearing transcript* is not to be offered* or if the evidence
that is given at a hearing is not to be offered at the trial*
the reason for that is that a judge makes a determination
that that evidence is not admissible.
QUESTION?

Is that the only circumstance?

What if

12
the party who has — called for the deposition just decides it
isn't needed, and therefore doesn’t offer it?
MR. BERNIUSs

Well, I think —

QUESTION? The prosecution ~ the prosecution takes
this pre-trial testimony in an abundance of caution, and then
when they put their case in they found they proved -- established
the same facts by other witnesses, and they never bother to
put the deposition in evidence.

Is it part of the trial

then?
MR. BERNXUS?

Not, in a strict sense, but in a

generic sense, yes, Your Honor.

I don't think that the fact

that a jury is selected is a mystical concept that precludes
the public's right to attend and observe and be aware of the
entire gamut of the proceedings, where there is testimony,
where there is cross-examination, where there is an attempt
to establish either the prosecution's point or the defense's
point.
QUESTION?

Well, doas the Sixth Amendment speak in

terms of proceedings or does it speak in terms of trial?
MR. BERNIUS:
obviously, of a trial.

Well, Your Honor, it speaks

in terms,

But it's our position that a suppression

hearing is clearly, for constitutional purposes, part of the
trial.

In fact, the statistics are that 90 percent of all

criminal cases, and 100 percent of criminal cases in Seneca
County for 2-1/2

years, were completed at the pre-trial stage.

>

13

QUESTION;

Well, counsel, what if the statistics

showed that 90 percent of the complaints of the prosecuting
attorney were never even prosecuted by information or indictment
by him?

Would that make the prosecuting attorney’s conference

among his colleagues part of the trial, because that was the
way so many cases were dispossd of?
MR. BERNIUS;

Well, Your Honor, there is a distinction

obviously between that situation and the situation where there
is a formal proceeding, an adversary proceeding? witnesses
are sworn; and a judge is going to make a determination based
on that testimony, a determination of fact,
I think that really the answer to the question of
when did the trial commence is to be found in the purposes
that are served-by the public trial clause.
One of those purposes, obviously, is to protect the
defendant; to see that his interests are not abused by the
prosecuting authorities.

But it goes beyond that.

There are interests in the public, specifically,
third parties may have a direct interest in the case.

But

the interst of the public in seeing that -QUESTION:

Why did the framers, then, case the

language of the Sixth Amendment in saying, the accused shall
enjoy the right of a public trial?
pr®®@ shall

Why didn’t they say the

&&&&&£> to the trial?

MR. BERNJfJS®

Of@ts.or, I think that, based on the

14
the prior history, and — which is developed to a certain extent
in our brief, but in the amicus brief of the National
Association of Broadcasters more extensively, there was really
no indication that in common Law the right of a public trial
accrued to the defendant at all.

There were broader purposes

behind it.
But the codification in the constitution, I think,
recognizes that the defendant should specifically be guaranteed
a fair trial, a public trial, but the — inherent in that
clause, the public trial clause, is a recognition, I would
submit that the public has an equal interest.
I think that the purposes that are served by the
clause mean that it should not be read literally.
QUESTION:

Well the framers certainly — the framers

here took an odd way of expressing it, if they meant to adopt
your view.
MR. BERNXUSs

Your Honor, I don’t think so.

Because,

again, inherent in that phrase, public trial, is the notion,
concept that the public has an interest in it; and based
*

Qn the prior history of common law, and based on the purposes
served by the public trial clause —
QUESTION:

Well, how can you tell what the purposes

served are except by reading the clause?
MR. BERNXUSs

I think, Your Honor, by looking at

the history and really analyzing it in the terms of the

15
essential nature of the guarantee and what it does.
The overwhelming purpose served is, as far as I can
tell, the insurance of the confidence of the public in the
judicial system, in the criminal justice system.

The public

nature of trials is, in effect, necessary to the vitality of
that system, and its viability,
I don't think that our criminal justice system would
long last if proceedings of this nature were held in secret.
And I think -QUESTIONs

Mr. Bernius, you argue anyway, don't you,

that independently of the Sixth Amendment public trial, that
the press, at least, has a First Amendment right to be
present?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Now, before you get into that — I now

you're going to argue it, I hope —- but what — does the
public also have a First Amendment right?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

I think so, Your Honor, yes.

I do —

You don't claim anymore for the press than

for the public?
MR. BERNIUS:

Absolutely not.

We think that the

public right is equivalent to the press' right.
QUESTION:

And this is First Amendment and not Sixth

Amendment?
MR. BERNIUS:

Thatfs right.

The --

16
QUESTION;

When

you gat to that, do you have any

cases from this Court that, wider the First Amendment, guarantees:
access to information?
MR. 3ERNIUS:
analogous case history.

Your Honor, the —- I believe I have an
First, that there was -- there's

no question in this case that the public cind the press had a
ri.ght to be present prior to the motion to exclude them.

The

court of appeals indicated that in its opinion? the respondents
concede that.
It's — the right to be present, I think, derives
primarily from the right to gather information, which was
recognized in this Court in Branzburg.

And I know that the

right to gather information is not without limits.
But I would submit that if there is any sort of right
to gather information, it must exist at trial, it must exist
in the streets, and other public forums.
And I think that for the purposes of the right to
gather information, the public forum test, which was developed
and most specifically articulated in the Granid

case gives

very pertinent guidance.
QUESTION s

Will you take that so far as to have the

right tc be present at a conference of members of an appellate
court?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION;

No, Your Honor.

Why not?

17
MR. 3ERKTUSs

Because the presence of the public or

the press at conferences of this Court or any other court would
be basically incompatible with the primary function of the —
of that -— of the public institution at that time.
QUESTION’:

Except I thought you based your approach

a little while ago on the right to gather information,
MR. BERNXUS:

That’s right, but it’s not •— it9s

c3early not unlimited, Your Honor.
And I think that the Court has answered that in some
of

the prison cases, it’s answered that to a certain extent

in the public forum cases, Marsh against Alabama, Adderley
against Florida, the cases where there's an asserted right to
be present to exercise First Amendment freedom.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bemius, what is the primary purpose

of suppression here?
MR. BERMIUSs

The primary function of th© suppression

is to determine, Your Honor, whether a jury should hear specific
eVidence, whether it is sufficiently reliable.
QUESTION:

And if the court determines it should not

be heard, and if the press has heard that evidence, is there
any restriction on the press publishing it so that it will
come to the attention of th© jury?
MR. BERN!US:
QUESTION:

The ~ no.

So how could the primary function of the

suppression hearing be performed if you're correct?

18

MR. BERNIUSs

Well, Your Honor, that is really, I

believe, one of the principal faults in the court of appeals
opinion.

The assumption that publication by definition means

A, that the jury will be affected by this information.

The

orders in this case were aimed directly at publication.

They®re

aimed at keeping the public ignorant of the fact of this
hearing.

And they're — the basis for the orders is public

ignorance with the hope that somehow an indirect benefit will
filter back to the trial.
QUESTIONs

What if the judge modified his orders and

expressly said that at the termination of the trial the
transcript of the suppression hearing will be made available
to anyone who wants it?

Then is there any suppression of

information?
MR. BERNIUS;

Yesf there is, Your Honor.

that this Court in Nebraska Press

I think

very much dealt at length

with the problems in delaying publication of news concerning
the criminal justice system.

f

Secondly, the —
QUESTION;

There, you're dealing with the trial, not

the pre-trial, weren't you?
MR. BERNIUSs
Your Honor.

Nebrask Press is a pre-trial situation,

The — the delay in this case is just as serious.

Secondly, the order in this case is in a sense more

19

dramatic than in Nebraska Press.

Because not only is there

a delay, but there is an absolute denial of the public's
knowledge of what went on in the suppression hearing.

As an

i

appellate court, this Court is well aware of the inadequacies
/

of the transcript.

But the tones, inflections, gestures,

everything that makes the presence of the trier of fact
so necessary to a determination

none of those things can

be recaptured in a transcript.
And —
QUESTIONS

But if there's — as Mr. Justice Stevens

suggested, if the interests of justice and fairness require
that the jury not hear a piece of evidence, how is that
purpose served?

I'm not sure you fully answered him.

How

is that purpose served if the jury hears it indirectly?
MR. BERNIUSs

Your Honor, we make no argument at all

that suppression hearings must be open under all circumstances.
V
We simply say that; the damage done both to First Amendment
interests and to the public trial interests of the public are
serious, and that if closure is to take place, it should take
place only as a last resort.
What has happened in this case is that the court
of appeals has said that closure, secret proceedings, are
preferable to change of venue, to continuance, to an extended
voir dire — all those separate alternatives that this Court
has repeatedly said would have been effective to mitigate the

20
effects of pre-trial publicity.
QUESTION:

If you were in a federal court, you would

have some difficulty using change of venue as an alternative
if the defendant objected, wouldn’t, you?
MR. BERNIUS§

Your Eonor, I — that is — it8a clear

that when there’s a continuance or change of venue or of
voir dire, to some extent it’s going to inconvenience a
defendant.
QUESTIONs

Well what about the vicinage requirement?

MR. BERNIUSs

The vicinage requirement, your Honor,

deals with the source of the jury.
venue of a case.

It doesn’t really deal with

And I think that the history of the vicinage

clause indicates that in the time of the enactment of the
Sixth Amendment, there were — the district — the federal
judicial district, were the equivalent of the states, with
the exception of Massachusetts and Virginia, which each had two
districts.

'
So I don’t think that the vicinage clause is of any

pertinence here since it’s, number one, outdated, and number
two, requires a jury essentially from the state.
QUESTIONj

Well, do you think the government could

jiave said, if this case had been pending in federal court, don’t
worry about opening the suppression hearing to the court
because we’re going to move for a change of venue down to
Tennessee?

21
MR. BERNIUS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that at that

point the defendants would have to make a choice.

And the fact

that venue may be laid in a certain area, the fact that
continuance would somehow interfere with a speedy trial, those
are considerations that all must be weighed.
But I don't think that in this situation where there
are important First Amendment rights and press and public
rights that any one guarantee can be deemed to be absolute.
What we9 re seeking here is an accommodation of all these
ss3entially conflicting values.
no conflict in this case.

What — there is, Your Honor,

There was no showing that publication

would in any sense have prejudiced the defendants' right to a
fair trial.

And there’s also been no showing in this case that

ejection or closure of this hearing would have helped to mitigate
that prejudice.
In fact, I think—
QUESTIONj

Well, Mr. Bernius, both defense lawyers
i

moved for the closure on the very ground that they /thought it
would be prejudiced.
Wasn't that the grounds, the reason it was closed?
MR. BERNIUS;

They moved on the basis that evidence

which may or may not be admissible at trial was to be admitted
at the suppression hearing, aud asked for it to be closed.
I don’t really know what that is.

I assume that they

were concerned with the effects of pre-trial publicity.

But

22
the concern is not enough, Your Honor.

There must be some

sort of showing to justify this unusual, and we submit,
unconstitutional, procedure.
QUESTIONs

What sort of showing would they make in

open court without revealing the very thing they wanted to
conceal?
MR. BERNIUS:

Well, Your Honor, first the most

dramatic example always is a suppression of a confession.
QUESTION s

Right.

MR. BERNIUS s

In many cases that the confession is

not admitted at a suppression hearing, it’s not really the
issue at a suppression hearing.
QUESTION:

The fact that a confession had

been made

would have to be disclosed, wouldn't it?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And would not that be prejudicial to the

defendant if it were published in the press?

And did you not

assert the right to publish whatever you heard at the hearing?
MR. BERNIUS:

Wa assert the right to publish whatever

we heard, but we already knew that there was a confession,
Your Honor.

And we could have published that no matter what

happened at the hearing.
QUESTION;

We could have said, and with full

Well, maybe in this case.

But in the

normal — in every case, it isn’t true that the press would
know whether there was a confession in advance, would it?

23
MR. BERNIUSs

Well, the press would know. Your Honor,

that there was an illegal search and seizure of evidence; that
there was ~ or there was a confession; or there was an illegal
wiretap*
They would know generically what was going on at that
hearing.

And it seems to me, Your Honor, that the fact that a

hearing was closed would not diminish the prejudicial impact of
a case.

Xt, in fact, would exaggerate it, that the public would

assume the worst at a closed hearing.
QUESTION:

You're really saying you're a better judge

Qf what's good for the defendants at trial posture than their
own counsel?
MR. BERNIUS:

No, I’m not, Your Honor.

But I think

that the defendants' rights are not absolutely paramount if
they're not — if there's not a demonstration that they are
in fact prejudiced.
QUESTION:

Did you say we knew here what it was that

the defense wanted to suppress?
MR. BERNIUSs

We knew that it was a confession, Your

Honor, and we knew that —
QUESTION:

Anything else?

MR. BERNIUS:

We knew that there was a gun that had

been seized.
QUESTION:

But do we know that the motion to suppress

identified the — it must have, I suppose — the items that

24
were sought to be suppressed?
MR. BERNIUS :
QUESTION?

Not specifically.

We don't know.

And there9s nothing in

this record to tell us?
MR. BERNXUS;
QUESTION;

No.

What Isra getting at is, didn't you —

I know the gun was found in Michigan, wasn't it?
MR. BERMIUS:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And

hadn't the papers already published

that before the suppression hearing?
MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

And you knew that there was a confession,

but you had not printed that?
MR. BERNIUS:

Absolutely.

In fact, the day after —

v.
QUESTION;

Absolutely it was or was not published?

MR. BERNIUS;

There was no reference in any of those

articles to a confession, and that's an important point, Your
Honor, that the press in this case was responsible.

Even the

article the day after the hearing was closed, the reporter did
not refer to the confessions or gun; she said, she described it
as evidence which might have been deemed admissible at
trial.
QUESTION;

Well, if you had had a hearing — I gather

one of your protests here is that you should have had a hearing
before the order of closure issue; is that right?

25

MR. BERNIUS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

If you had, what would you have argued?

MR. BERNIUS:

We would have argued that there was no

basis for the closure, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, on the ground that whatever was

the subject of the motion to suppress had already been
published?
MR. BERNIUS:

That8s one aspect to it, that closure

would be ineffective because it's not a gag order on the press?
they could publish — the single most prejudicial statement
that could be made is that the defendants confessed? and we could
have published that.
QUESTION:

You said earlier, Mr. Bsrnius, in response

to Mr. Justice Stevens, that the defendants’ right was not
paramount? I think those were your words.
You mean that defendants6 right to a fair trial is
not paramount?
MR. BERNIUS:

What I meant to say, Your Honor, is

that there must be an accommodation.

If a situation arose

where a defendant8s right to a fair trial was on the line against
the public8s right, First Amendment and Sixth Amendment right,
we do not say that the defendant9s right should not be paramount,
But it6s important to requiro the New York State court of appeals
and trial courts throughout the country not to abrogate the
right to the press and public unless it’s absolutely necessary,

26
and that a threat*, an actual threat, danger, to a fair trial
is shown, and thereBs a showing made that the ejection or closure
would be effective,, and finally and most importantly, there’s a
showing that the traditional shepherd alternatives would be
ineffective to cure that same —
QUESTION!

Well, suppose Mr. Bernius, in this case there

had been a hearing, and it had — the issue was a confession,
and the judge says, X8v© read the suppression and if the
newspapers and media would really do their job and get the
word out, which they apparently want to do, there-s going to
be a lot of people hear about this, and itGs going to make it
very difficult to get a jury.

ANd he makes a finding that

there is a serious danger to the fair trial rights of the
defendant.

QUESTION:

Well, what kind of evidence and what kind

of danger do you think would have to be present that wouldn't be
present when there9s a flat-out confession of a crime by the
defendant and interested media?

this case at least it was news?
MR, BERNIUS:

Yes.

Well, that's what —

You have to talk about television, the

reach of television coverage, don't, you?
MR. BERHIUS:

Certainly.

And that's not relevant

television or radio coverage in general —
QUESTION: Well, you don't; suppose there wouldn't
be, do you, if there was an open suppression hearing?

MR. BERNIUS:

There's nothing to indicate that there

QUESTION;

You think they're just going to stay home?

MR. BERHIUS:

In this case, yes.

But in — obviously,

as in Rideau, television coverage is certainly relevant, and
should be considered.

But in this case it wasn't considered.

should have been

evaluated.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Bernius, may I ask you, whether with

or without a prior hearing, there had been no closure order,and
you had sat, and members of the public, however many there
were, through the suppression hearing* and at the close of it,
the judge had then issued an order that you not publish until
at least after a jury had been chosen and sequestered, anything
that you heard that day and similarly, direct such an order
to the general public, whoever they are, present at the time.
You'd still be here, wouldn't you?
MR. BERNIUSt

Yes, sir.

On what grounds then?

MR. BERNIUS:

On the Nebraska Press test, Your Honor.

But the fact —
QUESTION:

The -- then Judge DePasquale apparently

anticipated your answer to Mr, Justice Brennan, didn't he?
MR. BERNIUS:

The colloquy among lawyers who were

involved in this, Your Honor, is that this situation is a

direct result of the Nebraska Press decision.

And it8s our

feeling that the roe chan ism — even though the mechanism is

great? and the standards of the Nebraska Press should be
complied with.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD KOBROFF? ESQ.?
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KOBROFF?

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it please

The right to

ai

the Court:
public trial is neither an absolute

right of the public nor of the press.

Pre-trial hearings and

portions of trials have been closed to the public? including
the media? for such situations as? preventing the disclosure
Qf a skyjack profile testimony? showing the emotional and
physical health of a pregnant witness? protecting the identity
of an undercover agent? permitting a prosecutrix to testify
uninhibitedly at a trial.
Respondent submits that the need to preserve and
infuse constitutional right to an impartial jury in a county
of venue is as important as any of these other interests
which have been held to justify closure of criminal proceedings.
Respondents called Edwin Greathouse and David Ray
Jones to challenge the admissibility of confessions that they

31
had given to Michigan police, and physical proof that these
confessions had led police to seiiae.
Respondent, Judge De Pasquale, was required to
resolve that this evidence had not been obtained in violation
of the accused's constitutional rights.

The admission of

this evidence, these full confessions to the alleged murder
and robbery, would undoubtedly have been prejudicial to these
defendants at their trial.

And widespread dissemination of

these confessions prior to trial could nonetheless have
predetermined their guilt in Seneca County.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't — it would just be a

if there was a hearing about why it was important to close the
proceedings, and why some other mechanisms wouldn't suffice?
MR. KOBROFFs

has held that the press is certainly entitled to have their
views known before the court.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn't what the trial judge

did, is it?

QUESTION:

They might also have to be used.

Must the exclusion, however, be the last

alternative, or ~
MR. KOBROFFs

Well, the difficult of exclusion as the

alternative is that if you wait until the voir dir® or
if you wait until change of venue can be done, the hearing's
already over; it's too late.
Exclusion is a prophylactic, and in a certain situation,
unusual situation — there is no denying this is an unusual
case — it is effective, and it should be available to a trial
court.

34

It is a fundamental tenet 'of due process that the
conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by
evidence and arguments in open court, and not by any outside
influence, whether

of private talk or public print.

Judge DePasquale had the obligation to prevent sup­
pressed evidence in determining the guilt of Greathouse and
Jones, and certainly for determining their guilt prior to trial;
to prevent the jury from learning of a coerced confession during
trial; yet all the while needlessly making it available to them
t

to read or hear of it before the trial, mocks the claim that our
system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the proba­
bility of unfairness.
i

For Judge DePasquala to have allowed public disclosure
of potentially tainted evidence which he had the constitutional
duty to exclude would involve the court itself in this taint
and illegality.
Respondents Greathouse and Jones were out-of-state
transients.

They were accuse! of a murder and robbery of a

local area resident, Wayne Clapp, a former police officer
with roots in the community.

several days later.

That was confronting the — or

I think that’s a major distinction from what

you had in Murphy.
On the day of the suppression motion, we had three
reporters in the courtroom that we know of:

petitioner's reporter,

a reporter from the Geneva Times, and a reporter from the Syracuse
Post.

Together, these papers accounted for almost 85 percent

of the daily newspaper circulation in Seneca County.

QUESTION:

Well, are these statistics very important?

37

MR, KOBROFF:

Mo, no,

I just want to state them to

make a point that in fact what would have occurred at this
hearing would have been widely and immediately disseminated.
I think that three newspapers will not put three reporters in
Seneca County courthouse unless they feel thereSs a news
story and unless they're going to use it.

That's the only

reason, and the fact that they do have a circulation in that
county.
Greathouse and Jones moved to the exclusion of the
media reporesentatives.

They argued that the deleterious

effects of disclosure, the evidence they sought to suppress,
sought to be suppressed, would outweight their right to a public

Supposing the New York. State legislature passed a law saying
that all trials —* all criminal trials — in the state shall be
closed unless otherwise required by the constitution of the
United States,

And both the defendant and the prosecutor agreed

in this particular case that the trial should be closed; they
both moved for it or stipulated to it.
Does that raise any constitutional issue?
MR. KOBROFF;

Well, I would first of all say that I

42
think that’s very unlikely.

It would be a rather strange statute.

But let’s suppose it was enacted.
MR. KOBROFFs

I tell you, what I do

have with me, if Your Honors would want it, is a copy of
Judge DePasquale’s decision 01 the hearing.

That much I have

with me, if Your EOnors would want it.
Judge DePasquale could not close his eyes to the

46
obvious, needless prejudice to the accused's constitutional
right that was about to occur.

He had the duty to protect the

respondents Greathouse and Jones' right to a trial by an
impartial jury in the county of venue, and he did what any
prudent judge would have done.
QUESTION:

How about the -- do you see any constitutional

problems at what — Judge DePasquale did, say, well, the press
may stay and the public may stay, and they heard the whole
thing.

And at the close of it, he said, this may be prejudicial,

and he issues an order directed to the press and public
present?
MR. KOBROFFs
QUESTIONt

You don't think —

MR, KOBROFFs
decided that issue.

I don't think he could do that.

I think Nebraska Press pretty well

That’s just not available.

I mean — and

in addition, I think this Court even held in Nebraska Press
that what occurs at a public hearing may not be —- cannot
be subject to a prior restraint.
So that option was never even available, insofar
as that goes.
QUESTION:

Would that fall within what I think Mr.

Justice Frankfurter saids

Once the cat is out of the bag,

it's impossible to get it back in again?
MR. KOBROFFs
QUESTION $

That seems to be the rule.

What was the judge's decision in this

47
case on admissibility?
MR. KOBROPPs

Certain confessions, certain segments,

were suppressed? others were not.
statements were made, and then

Apparently, certain

i n the presence of attorneys,

more statements were made.
What is involved in this case is the constitutional
right of an accused to a trial by an impartial jury in a

county of venue, and the right of the public, including
potential jurors and media representatives, to have immediate
access to pre-trial evidentiixy suppression hearings.
The case does not concern the right of the press to
publish free from prior restraint.

There were no restraints

on press publication in this case; no injunctions restraining
the press from publishing anything it wanted to; no contempt
citations punishing the press for having published anything.
Petitioner8s error is in equating a temporary
denial of public access to potentially inadmissible evidence
with a court-ordered direct restraint on publication.
The press was at all times free to publish anything
. t wanted to aboiit the case of people v. Greathouse and Jones.
If the press had learned what, transpired at this in camera
roce@ding, their publicationof this evidence would have
lr

been unrestrained.
Petitioner nonetheless argues that the public,
including prospective jurors8, right to immediate access to this

as to reliability, admissibility; testimony found to be
probably destructive of an accused's constitutional right to
an impartial jury»
If this right to immediate access is entitled to the
same constitutional protection as the press' right to publish
free from governmental censorship, respondent submits that
there is no basis in law or reason for this equation.
This has never bean the requirement, this has never
been the standard, to deny — in instances where courtrooms
have been closed.

In none of the instances to protect the

identity of an undercover agent, to allow a witness to testify
uninhibitedly; this has never been the standard used.
And such a standard would severely undermine an
accused's constitutional right, to an impartial jury.
And without an impartial jury, any other right granted to an
accused is meaningless.
An important value in our society, the value embodied
in che constitution, is of a trial by an impartial jury in a
county where the crime was allegedly committed.

This requirement

of a fair trial has been interpreted to mean not only the
absence of actual bias, but even the absence of the probability
of unfairness.
To further protect the rights of an accused, our
society extends reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence

49

and other

burdens in favor of an accused.
Before a confession can be offered in evidence against

an accused, it must first have been determined by, at least
a preponderance of the evidence, to have been knowingly,
voluntarily and intelligently given.
If it is determined that a jury even considered a
coerced confession, it is automatic reversal.

It can never be

harmless error.
Petitioner insists that before a court can exclude
the public, including prospective jurors, from a hearing
involving a coerced confession, that the accused must, in
open court, in an adversarial proceeding,' satisfy the awesome
standard necessary to justify governmental censorship.
Respondents submit that this standard certainly
gives an accused far less than he has the right to expect in
our society and under the constitution.
Petitioner

bases his argument on the public and

potential jurors5 right to immediate access to suppression
hearing testimony on the fact that the flow of information to
the public concerning pre-tricil suppression hearings is
vital to public understanding of the judicial system.
There is no claim here that the press5 right to
publish is being restrained.
QUESTION:

Suppose, Mr. Kobroff, that there wasn't —

that — there was a plea here, so it never came to trial.

Being a homicide case# would it have been a sequestered jury?
MR. KOBROFF:
QUESTION;

Perhaps.

And if it had been, would these restraints

upon publication of the transcript of the suppression hearing
have been operative?
MR. KOBROFF;

I would think that they probably

wouldn't have been necessary in that case.
QUESTION;

I mean —

And they could have been released?

As

soon as the jury was sequestered?
MR. KOBROFFs

I would think that as soon as you have

the jury, and you can insulate the jury, that the defendants'
interests are just no longer in jeopardy.
I mean, the threat here is that you've got potential
jurors, you've got the prospective jury sitting in the court­
room.

And you've got to insulate them? I mean, you're required

to.
And this is the meaas to do it.
QUESTION:

But all the newspapers could publish would

be the record, the transcript?
MR. KOBROFF;
QUESTION;

Yes, of course.

They couldn't draw any nuance or anything

from having witnesses appear?

Well, I —

Yeah, thsy could.

Well, two is better than one.

MR. KOBROFF:

It might not be the best —

Two is better than one, isn't it?

MR. KOBROFF:
QUESTION:

No.

Right, right.

Well, the record plus the sight of the

witness is two.
MR. KOBROFF:

I agree.

I'm simply saying that it's still newsworthy.

You're right.
QUESTION:

But it — still —

That's too bad.

not an easy decision for this Court.

I'm not saying it is.

I mean, you've got the balancing here.

How does a written news story convey

the nuances that you've been discussing?

MR. KOBROFF?

Well —

Any different — any differently from the

written transcript?
Television would be different.
MR. KOBROFF?

Radio, perhaps.

I tell you, I am not a newspaper

MR. KOBROFF?

Yes.

Well, then, how do you explain why they

sent three reporters and didn't just wait for the transcript?
MR. KOBROFF?

Well, I think they wanted it

They just wanted to spend their money.

MR. KOBROFF?

Well, I think they thought this was a

If there is any absolute in our constitutional
system* it's that an accused must receive a fair trial before
he can be lawfully convicted.

Of primary consideration is the

public8s interest in avoiding anything that would truncate

To maintain an accused's right to an impartial jury

Respondent submits that the decision of the New York
court of appeals reaches a wise balancing between the right
of the press to publish free from governmental restraint and
the right of an accused to an impartial jury in the county
of venue.
Respondent submits that the decision of the New York
court of appeals should be affirmed.
Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.
