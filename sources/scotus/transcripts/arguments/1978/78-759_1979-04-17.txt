MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Leroy v. Great Western United Corporation.
Mr. Helser.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER E. HEISER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HEISER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Idaho official appellants in this case believe
that the jurisdiction and venue issues that are brought here
before the Court are the most important jurisdiction and
venue issues relating to federal court jurisdiction over
state officials since the decision in 1908 in Ex Parte Young,
and that the issues on the merits of this case are very de­
manding, very interesting in the interrelationship of
federal securities laws and state securities laws in a
system of cooperative federalism.
This case involves an attempt by the appellee
Great Western United Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange
traded Delaware corporation, with corporate officers in
Colorado, executive offices in Texas, and which does busi­
ness throughout the United States to effect a cash oartial
tender offer for up to two million shares of the outstanding
common stock of the Sunshine Mining Company, a New York
Stock Exchange traded Washington State corporation, with

5
its principal asset a silver mine located in the State of
Idaho, Its corporate offices in the State of Idaho, its
executive offices in New York, and other substantial assets
in the States of Maryland and New York.
Though In this case the proposed tender offer was
initiated by Great Western United Corporation in Dallas,
Texas, the tender offer was announced and disseminated
through a New York investment banking firm and the shares
were to be tendered to a Chicago, Illinois, bank.

As far

as timing was concerned, on Monday, March 21, 1977, Great
Western United Corporation simultaneously filed a Schedule
14D statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
as required by the Williams Act amendment to the 193*1
Securities Exchange Act which relates to cash tender offers
for corporate control.

It voluntarily appeared in the Stat>

of Idaho to file a registration statement under the Idaho
corporate takeover law, which is the subject of the con­
stitutional challenge herein.

And it inquire of the States

of Maryland and New York as to whether those states would
exercise jurisdiction under their respective state takeover
laws.
Four days later, that Friday, the Deputy Adminis­
trator of Securities of the State of Idaho responded to
Great Western United requesting additional information
under the Idaho filing and contemporaneously appellant

6
MeEldowney, the Director of the Idaho Department of Finance,
submitted an executive order, administrative order delaying
the effective date of the tender offer.

No other official

from any state, including appellant Kidwell, who has been
replaced in office by appellant Leroy, took any action or
threatened any action.

They were merely officials who were

charged under their respective state laws with administering
those respective state securities laws.

Nor did Great
«a»

Western United ever attempt to negotiate or respond in part
to the request of Idaho for additional information, despite
the fact that one of those requests was merely that the
eight missing pages from the Xerox copy of the 14D statement
which had been filed with the SEC be submitted.
Instead, Great Western United’s sole response to
the request for additional information that was received by
them on a Friday, was the next Monday morning at 9:00
o'clock in the morning to appear in Federal District Court
in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, seeking
an ex parte temporary restraining order in a lawsuit which
challenged the constitutionality of the state takeover laws
of Idaho, Maryland and Mew York, and asserted that personal
jurisdiction and venue were proper over the state officials’
challenge under the Ex Parte Young stripping doctrLne in
the Northern District of Texas, rather than in their home
states.

7
QUESTION:

Was the sole basis for this claim the

fact that the federal law preempted the Idaho law?
MR. REISER:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnqulst, the basis

for the constitutional challenge was preemption or. the one
hand and on the other hand that the Idaho law and Maryland
and New York laws unduly burdened interstate commerce and
were therefore forbiddn. on that ground as well.
QUESTION:

I suppose the mere existence of an

Idaho statute which might ultimately be determined to be
preempted by a federal statute wouldn’t mean that the state
official charged with administering would be ’’violating" the
federal statute within section 27.
MR. HEISER:

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, that is ex­

actly our contention.

We have a situation here where the

officials Involved were themselves regulators of securities
transactions and are being sought to be held under the juris­
diction and venue portion of the Securities Exchange Act of
193^ to be subject to suit under that as though they had
participated in fraudulently activities or had in fact
violated some direct command of the Securities Exchange Act.
QUESTION:

What is the basis for the jurisdictional

question?
MR. HEISER:

That is the federal securities laxtf

basis for jurisdiction, that is correct, Mr. Justice White.
The other basis for jurisdiction was the Texas long arm

8
statute.

And under the Texas long arm statute, It was

alleged that the Idaho and other officials were actually
doing business in Texas and doing business is a jurisdic­
tional prerequisite within that statute.
step analysis that must be reached.
two categories of doing business.

It has a two-

The statute defines
One of those categories,

strange as it may seem, is a tort that occurs in whole or
in part in Texas but that is defined in there as doing
business.

The other aspect of doing business in Texas under

the Texas long arm statute as defined is a contract, the
performance of which occurs all or In part in Texas.

Then

the statute opens up the scope and it says that it en­
compasses other activities that may constitute doing business
in Texas, and it is very much the appellants’ contention
that their activity in a governmental capacity in being in
Idaho, as Idaho officials, charged with and administering
Idaho law, is certainly not an activity of doing business
in Texas with the commercial overtone that that doing busi­
ness concept necessarily Implies.
That is the threshold consideration that must be
reached in the Texas long arm statute for assertion of
personal Jurisdiction.

The next requirement for inquiry is,

of course, constitutional due process, International Shoe,
Hanson v. Denckla.

Again, phrased in terms of minimum

contacts, activities that are commercial, profit oriented

9
activities that would subject a company or organization or
person engaged in interstate commerce in a profit oriented
mode to be rightfully subjected to jurisdiction in a place
where the consequences of that commercial activity were
felt.
We submit that the basis of this Court* s deter­
minations in due process really relate to the fact that the
entity of person subjected to the jurisdiction of the outof-state forum has been one who has sought the profit
orientation of commercial activity.

Never before has it

been applied to a state official who is merely a regulator.
In fact3 the mischief of it being applied really
relates to a question that was earlier posed this morning
by Justice Marshall about being sued in Maui.

And while

it may be nice for a state official to be able to vacation
in Maui, it certainly is difficult when a state official
would be called to defend his action in Idaho in enforcing
an Idaho law in Idaho, in Maui or in any other place.
The chilling effect that that would have on the
enforcement of state laws, the chilling effect it would
have on legislatures in determining what law that they,
passed might be deemed to have somewhere in some other
jurisdiction of this United States an extra territorial
effect or consequence would be incredible, and the budgetary
problems that defending in a foreign jurisdiction present

10
are also potentially overwhelming.

The cost of sending

attorneys and officials who were hired by their state to
represent activities within the state, sending them to
foreign jurisdictions to defend actions, the exper.se of
the legislature in a small state such as Idaho trying to
figure appropriations that would cover defenses in. juris­
dictions throughout the United States of allegations that
are brought merely because someone feels they have been
affected in a foreign jurisdiction, and the expense in many
of the federal districts of the United States where a
person cannot be admitted directly to practice before that
federal district but must have —• sometimes can appear pro
hac vice with associate counsel, local counsel, in other
instances you cannot be admitted to practice before that
district at all and you must hire local counsel.
QUESTION:

Mr. Helser, what if this case had

arisen with a plaintiff as one who was contending that the
takeover shou3,d not be permitted because the corporation
had not complied with the Idaho statute, that plaintiff
lived in Texas and otherwise had standing, is there any
reason why in that sort of a lav/suit where Idaho officials
weren’t joined as parties the District Court in Texas
couldn’t hold that the federal statute preempted the Idaho
statute?
MR. REISER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if it were

11
procedurally proper to entertain the lawsuit In the Northern
District of Texas, there Is absolutely no reason why the
Idaho law could not be assessed as It affected someone in
the Northern District of Texas, that is correct, but that
is not what happened here, unfortunately.

Of course, we

contend that had this lawsuit been brought in the District
of Idaho, as it should have been, there would be no question
that it Is a lawsuit that Is properly entertainable in
Federal District Court in the District of Idaho, but un­
fortunately It was not brought there and that is what noses
the very difficult jurisdiction and venue —
QUESTION:

I suppose New York and Maryland on

your basis would have the same objection to jurisdiction in
Idaho as you are objecting to In Texas?
MR. HEISER:
lutely correct.

Mr. Justice White, that is abso­

In fact, New York and Maryland very strenu­

ously did object to the jurisdiction and venue being based
In Texas, as I am sure they would have had it been based in
Idaho.
QUESTION:

But you wouldn't go so far as to say

that given all the other necessary requirements of federal
jurisdiction and venue, only the Federal District Court
sitting in Idaho could hold an Idaho statute preemoted by
a federal statute.
MR. HEISER:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

12
would not be my contention.

Under proper jurisdiction and

venue in raising the federal question, it would be proper
for a federal court to consider the Idaho law or someone
else’s law and there might be a situation like that where
Idaho would participate as amicus curiae and volunteer to
come down.

I am not saying that there is restraint on the

Court in entertaining tlie Idaho law.

In fact, I think

there Is ample Supreme Court precedent for that occurring.
There has been an allegation made that the State
of Idaho delayed the effective date of Great Western's
tender offer for the shares of Sunshine Mining Company
stock and that it therefore interfered with the transaction
of $31 million of interstate commerce.
In fact, the delay attributable to action by Idaho
was for a period of two days, from May 28th to March 30th,
1977, when after hearing that there was an ex parte temporary
restraining order sought, we asked the Federal District
Judge in Dallas to allow us to go on the record and he post­
poned the hearing for two days.
All the other delay in this case either resulted
from a lawsuit that was brought by Sunshine Mining Company
in the District of Idaho against Great Western United under
the Williams Act, charging that Great Western United had
not complied with the Williams Act, and the other delay was
occasioned by Great Western’s desire to pursue in the

13
Northern District of Texas this constitutional challenge
to the Idaho, New York and Maryland takeover statutes.
We have additionally the venue problems.

Venue

was alleged under the Securities Exchange Act of 193^,
section 27, and venue there was sought on the basis that
the violations that were alleged to have been committed by
the state officials actually occurred in the State of Texas
rather than in the State of Idaho, when in fact the action
that did take place was action that was taken in Idaho
pursuant to the Idaho law, was transmitted to Texas at the
request of Great Western United which had sought the
response to be sent to them in Texas.

So It may have come

to rest in Texas, but it took place in Idaho and it, of
course, creates the awkward situation that if you say that
for venue purposes you have properly a single federal
district for venue purposes a.s the place where the violation
occurred, rather than a place where acts in furtherance of
a violation occurred, which is not what the venue statute
says, then you create this strange situation where if venue
is proper in the Northern District of Texas, then it cannot
be proper in the District of Idaho, and what you are really
challenging is the action of the Idaho officials, the Idaho
law, and the constitutionality of the Idaho law.
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question in two stages.

First, suppose the Idaho company borrowed money from a

Houston bank In Texas and as usual submitted financial
statements and defaulted on the loan and suit was brought,
where would venue lie, in Texas?
MR. HEISER:

Mr. Chief Justice, under the terms

of the Texas long arm statute, where you had defined within
the doing business context of that statute, a contract to
be performed in whole or in part in Texas, it is quite
likely that the Federal District Court in Texas would have
proper jurisdiction over that action so long as it did not
fall within the proscription of U-Anchor Advertising, Inc.
v. Burt.
QUESTION:

Now, eliminate the Texas statute from

the hypothetical and have the same loan made, financial
statements submitted, and it turned out that the financial
statements were allegedly false, would venue lie in Texas
Independent of the Texas long arm statute?
MR. HEISER:

Under the general venue statute,

Your Honor?
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:

Yes.
Under the general venue statute,

then it would be proper for all the defendants resided or
where the act, the violator of the act or transaction that
is the subject matter occurred, and in this Instance while
the loan was sought in Texas, it would appear from the
hypothetical you pose that the default occurred in Idaho

15
and the venue would therefore be —
QUESTION:

The false statement was delivered to

Texas, to the bank, the lender.
MR. HEISER:

Isn’t that enough?

You have there a situation of a

weight of contacts problem, where one of the acts in
furtherance, if that is the operative fact, the false
statement and its transmission into Texas, then, yes,
there are cases which hold that the venue would be proper
in Texas, although under a weighing of contacts analysis
it might also be deemed proper that venue would be laid in
Idaho, if that were the —
QUESTION:

There is no question about it being

in Idaho.
MR. HEISER:

Well, it would be in Idaho under

the defendants, where the defendants resided.
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:

Definitely.
But as far as where the act or

transaction occurred, I think that you could have it either
in Idaho or in Texas where there is a deliberate fraudulent
activity because in that context which you pose, Your Honor,
there you have a deliberate action by the defendant which
he wants to have a jurisdiction causing effect in Texas.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reiser, are we talking now about

venue or jurisdiction, and if jurisdiction are we talking
over the person or over the subject matter, and are we

16
talking as a matter of what is permissible under the Con­
stitution or what is provided by state statute?

I have

been lost in this discussion.
MR. REISER:

Mr. Justice Stewart, that has been

one of the problems of this case from the beginning.

It

is our contention —
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:

Well, in this particular question —
— that there are several distinct

criteria which must be met, that there are three criteria
which must be met —
QUESTION:

Must be met, what, under the Consti­

tution or under some state statute?
MR. HEISER:

Must be met under the Constitution

as well — well, there are criteria that must be met under
the Constitution, due process standards.
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:

Yes.
There are three criteria which must

be met under the Federal Securities Act jurisdiction and
venue provision, and there are special criteria which must
be met under the Texas long arm statute.

Under the

Securities Act jurisdiction and venue statute, there must
be subject matter jurisdiction.

It has been alleged that

there is subject matter jurisdiction because the state
officials in enforcing or being charged with the enforce­
ment of a state law allegedly in conflict with federal law

17
rises somehow to the dignity of a violation of the
Securities Exchange Act of 193^ and that therefore there
is subject matter jurisdiction.
Next j it has been said that there is personal
Jurisdiction over the officials because the action that
they took was having an effect on a corporation ir Texas
and that venue was proper in Texas because that was the
district where the effect of the action in Idaho was felt.
QUESTION:

It is personal jurisdiction over the

Idaho officials, which is the big threshold issue here,
isn't it?
MR. HEISER:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And it is personal jurisdiction over

them., not subject matter jurisdiction over the case,
personal jurisdiction over the Idaho officials, whether
there is under the Constitution of the United States,
whether there can be, isn’t that it?
MR. HEISER:
lutely correct.

Mr. Justice Stewart, that is abso­

There is the one additional problem we

have in that the personal jurisdiction that was alleged
under the Securities Exchange Act of 193^ was alleged be­
cause of the further allegation of subject matter juris­
diction In that they violated, the Act because of —
QUESTION:

Let's assume they violated the Act,

there is still a threshold question —

18
MR. HEISER:
QUESTION:

There is still the —
—- of whether or not the court had

personal jurisdiction over them, isn’t it?
MR. HEISER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And under

the Texas long arm statute, that is the crux of the con­
tention.
QUESTION:

But if there was a violation, there

is nationwide serice, isn’t there?
MR. HEISER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice White —
Let’s assume there was a violation by

the Idaho officers — and I don’t suggest that I think there
was — doesn't the securities law provide for nationwide
jurisdiction service?
MR. HEISER:

Mr. Justice White, that is correct,

it provides for nationwide service of process.
QUESTION:

We —

Wouldn’t; that give personal jurisdic­

tion?
MR. HEISER:

That would give personal jurisdiction

in a court where the due process standards were properly
applied.
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:
of the argument.

Right.
And there again we go to the crux

It has been the contention that sometimes

in the case that due process does not obtain in an action
such as is brought under section 27 of the Securities Act

19
because there is nationwide service of process and there­
fore a state official can be served anywhere where a court
can issue that process.
QUESTION:

Anybody can served by a federal court

within the bounds of our nation.
MR. HEISER:

Absolutely, Mr.

Justice Stewart,

anybody may be served by the court, but the threshold ques­
tion there is is that the proper court to issue the service
and that Is the crux —
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:

Isn't that a matter of venue then?
That Is a matter of whether one wants

to call venue or proper assertion of personal jurisdiction,
it is whether that is the proper court.

That Is the purpose

of trying to stop the forum shopping.
QUESTION:

Well, what if Congress says in so many

words that if there has been a violation of the Act, as Mr.
Justice White’s question to you assumed, process may be
served and personal jurisdiction may be obtained In any ere
of the 93 judicial districts in the United States.
MR. HEISER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if that Is

what the statute said then I would still try to be here
before you saying that that statute in assessing personal
jurisdiction on such a broad scope was missing the very
important due process requirement that allows the federal
court to hear the case in the first place.

20
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t you have that even in

a case where the prosecution or the action arose in a ease
where the alleged violation occurred?
MR. HEISER:
QUESTION:

Mr. Justice White, no.
Of course you would.

MR. HEISER:
QUESTION:

That is the whole point.
So If the violation occurs ir State A

and the federal laws says that you can serve anybody con­
nected with this case anywhere in the country, you wouldn’t
object to that?
MR. HEISER:
is the xvhole point.

Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that
If this were brought in the District

of Idaho and for some reason the Idaho officials had to be
served In Hawaii or Alaska or wherever, nationwide service
of process, absolutely no problem whatsoever.
QUESTION:

Well, that doesn’t determine where the

venue is going to lie.
MR. HEISER:

That’s correct. Your Honor.

That is

where the claim or the act in violation occurred, is where
the venue of the case is laid.
QUESTION:

All of this colloquy Is addressed to

the federal statute, is It not?
MR. HEISER:

All of this is directed to jurisdic­

tion under section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act.
QUESTION:

This case involves the Texas statute,

21
doesn't it?
MR. HEISER:

That is one basis for jurisdiction.

The other basis — the one basis for jurisdiction over the
state officials is section 27 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 193^.

The alternative basis for jurisdiction over

the state officials was under the Texas long arm statute
and its accompanying venue statute.

So what the two courts

below found was that jurisdiction was proper in the Northern
District of Texas by coming down these two avenues, either
one of which —QUESTION:

Well, don’t you agree that if your

opponents can sustain either one of those that the Court of
Appeals was correct?
MR. HEISER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if this Court

would sustain either one of those, then the Court of Appeals
is correct, but —
QUESTION:

There are independent bases cf juris­

diction?
MR. HEISER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But it is

our contention that both of them are absolutely wrongly
decided because both of them misapplied not only the due
process standards but failed to come to grips with the
doing business prerequisite on the one hand and the Texas
long arm statute and created this incredible fiction that
state officials who were enforcing a state law in Idaho,

22
themselves regulators of securities transactions, were
somehow guilty of the same type of activity that people
who are subject to the Williams Act and the other portions
of the Securities Exchange Act violate.
QUESTION:

That is answering the question that •

Mr. Justice White earlier asked you to assume.

Suppose

they go into the Northern District of Texas and allege that
you have violated the securities act and allege venue and
jurisdiction under section 27, now don’t you think that
Congress has a right to allow that sort of jurisdiction
and venue If It

expressly says so. and If the plaintiffs

can satisfactorily make out a case that you have violated
the thing?
QUESTION:

In Texas.

QUESTION:

In Texas.

MR. HEISER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, yes.

If the

prerequisites that you say, if there has been a violation,
truly a violation, if the statute were framed in such a way,
the underlying law were framed in such a way that a violation
truly could be said to have occurred, yes, if Congress con­
structed —
QUESTION:

Insofar as your having violated the

statute or not -— and I don’t suggest one way or another •—
your position or your status is the same in Idaho as it is
in Texas?

You have violated it in Texas just as much as

23
you have in Idaho, but no more or no less?
MR. HEISER:

You have violated it, Mr. Justice

White, any place in the United States.
QUESTION:
MR. HEISER:

Exactly.
But then if you violated it at all,

then you would not necessarily be proper in the United
States and then you are back to venue,
I reserve the balance of my time.
QUESTION:
a detail.

Mr. Heiser, before you sit down, just

Is the Attorney General properly here?
MR. HEISER:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, it is my con­

tention that the Attorney General is properly here.

The

decision of the Firth Circuit Court of Appeals, although
the Attorney General did not make a formal appeal from the
District Court decision, at all times during the context
and in the writings of the Fifth Circuit, it treated the
officials in the plural as if both of them were before the
court, it affirmed the decision of the court belox* that
related to both of the officials, and It is our contention
that the Attorney General is properly before this Court
because the Fifth Circuit wrongly or rightly certainly did
assert jurisdiction over him and adjudged the case with
regard to him,
QUESTION:

Speaking of Attorney General, I think

In your brief you have Ex Parte Young as the Attorney

24
General of Minnesota.

Sometimes we in Minnesota might be

glad to yield that to Michigan, as you have described him,
or one of the briefs did, I think yours, but Ex Parte
Young is the Attorney General of Minnesota.
MR. HEISER:

In the summary of argument, my printer

got Michigan and in my argument he did it right as
Minnesota.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Juviler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. AMY JUVILER, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MRS. JUVILER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The unprecedented decisions below with which you
have just been grappling with Mr. Heiser, changed the law
with regard to jurisdiction and venue so as to expose the
state, their officials and the laws enacted by the citizens
of this country through their state representatives to
unfair trial as occurred in this case.

There was no reason

whatsoever, none to warrant the established procedures to
accommodate Great Western United, a multistate corporation
seeking to expand its Idaho operations.

Suit in the

District Court in Idaho was possible and was convenient
for the defendants, as we demonstrated in our brief.
The only reason that these problems are presented
to Your Honors, that of subject matter jurisdiction under

25
the Securities Act, personal jurisdiction under the
Securities Act, and the long arm statute and the limits on
those statutes posed by due process, and the questions of
venue not only under the general venue statute of this
Court in issues which have never been presented before and
venue under the Securities Act, the only reason was that
because the lower courts were impatient to exercise their
own jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction of the Northern
District Court and the jurisdiction of the Pirth Circuit
in order to decide a superficial and intellectual question
only, and that is whether the law of Idaho was preventing
shareholders of Sunshine Milling Company who personally
resided in other states from selling their shares to Great
Western United.
Those shares we must remember throughout this
case were in a company whose major asset is the largest
silver mine in the United States, and a very important
resource of the State of Idaho,, and it is permanently lo­
cated in Idaho.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Juviler, your friend, Mr. Heiser,

in response to Justice Blackmun, said that very definitely
the appellant is here.

Could he have taken an appeal to

the Court of Appeals from the District Court judgment?
Could he?

We know that he didn’t, if I recall correctly.
MRS, JUVILER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

26
that appellant Kidwell could.

That is an Interesting ques­

tion to pose to the representative of the Attorney General
of New York who sat in our office and debated whether we
could take an appeal because we had to expend public monies
and, may I say, my own private funds because the Comptroller
didn’t think that I was really on state business in Dallas
and New Orleans, he thought I was on some frolic and detour
for my own amusement.

Also the people who provided us the

transcripts have similarly suffered the skepticism of the
Comptroller of the State of New York.

But we determined

that we wouldn't burden this Court with yet another juris­
dictional problem in a case already bothered, and we chose
not to appeal but to appear as amicus throughout, although
we feel personally aggrieved -- I mean the Attorney General
feels personally aggrieved for having to defend hie statute
in Texas when there was no reason whatever to do so, leaving
aside all of the legal objections and the Constitution.
Along the way in doing this, we are- not only deal­
ing with statutes that failed to provide jurisdiction and
venue over state officials, but the policy that is reflected
by Congress’ utter lack of interest in securing this kind
of jurisdiction over state officials is part of the way our
government is organized.

I am not going to go so far here

because it is unnecessary to say that if Congress wrote the
kind of statute that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was talking about,

27

it vfould be unconstitutional as a violation of our federal
rights.

We would first have to see it -- or perhaps uncon­

stitutional as a. violation of due process of the individual
state officials sued under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young
as to whether they were given adequate notice that they
would be exposed in foreign jurisdictions for their actions
in good-faith compliance with their own laws.
QUESTION:

You don't deny that a private citizen

could be made subject to suit anywhere in the United States
by Congress, do you?
MRS, JUVILER:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don't

deny that it would be possible for Congress to establish
nationwide service over state officials, if the statute not
only gave full notice but was based on some reasonableness
and action, also had some basis in the jurisdiction in
which —
QUESTION:

What if Congress just said in so many

words that there shall be nationwide service of process on
everyone who is alleged to violate the statute when it
didn't purport to make any finding of reasonableness, they
just said this is what the law is going to be?
MRS. JUVENILE:;

If Congress had done that —- well,

one of the basic questions, we use the word "violate," and
it has been used here a great many times, it is not conceded
and I think it does not do credit to the language of the

28
statute, the states are not violators, the language of a
state statute which is in conflict with the Williams Act
or with any other act of the securities lav/ is precisely
that conflict.

The word 'Violation” does not fairly

apprise the state official that what he does is in conflict
or in fact if someone sought to sue the official of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, under the same ground,
I don't think he would be given due process notice that he
would be exposed to suit as a violator unless Congress also
said a violation means that you act in conflict with the
statute.
And then I think if Congress did that, securities
administrators would know that a new era has come into the
United States and state statutes governing securities, in­
stead of giving the heavy presumption in favor of them
that they are presently given, now are to be treated as sub­
stantively suspect.

And because we have a procedural system

that reflects the substantive law of securities regulation
in this country as well as corporate regulation, one can
expect that in ordinary state statute which governs affairs
of corporations within that state, actually within that
state, and the affairs of securities trading regarding such
a corporation, such a statute is presumed correct and is not
presumed to be a violation unless Congress held hearings
and thought about it a lot and did it.

But Congress hasn't

29
threatened us with that nor is there any suggestion that
Congress went so far.
And all of this, Your Honors might want manipu­
lation, the courts below did, the law to get at the issue
if there wasn’t a court sitting that could get at the issue.
But we have conceded from the beginning that there was
subject matter jurisdiction under the supremacy clause,
under 1331s and subject matter jurisdiction was available
in Idaho.
QUESTION:

You know us better than to think we

wouId want to manipulate, don’t you?
MRS. JUVTLER:

I used the wrong — well, we feel

that it is very difficult to look at the decisions below
and not think that the laws of jurisdiction and venue have
been manipulated.

Not one single decision has a direct

precedent, nothing In the finding jurisdiction and venue
over the defendant here has a precedent in any previous de­
cision.

None of it is required by the language of any

statute except by interpretation that is overlaid and is
not supported by precedent.
Just as an example of the most minor aspect of
the venue decision of the court below, look what it did to
a multi-state corporation doing business all over the
country.

Suddenly it can now sue where its board of di­

rectors reside, even though it is conceded it was doing

30

business in Idaho and it was Idaho business that v»as at
issue.
Suddenly in a federal court, venue now lies for
this kind

of action in Texas, and the court below implies

that that is the only place it can lie.

That applies not

only to actions against state officials but to actions
against federal officials and to actions against people who
have commercial dealings with Great Western United.

Indeed,

when Sunshine Mining sued Great Western under the Williams
Act In the District of Idaho following — or sued HIRCO, the
successor company, after the completion of this tender offer,
Great Western United said, oh, no, you have got to sue us
in the Northern District of Texas, we have special rights,
we can only be sued in the Northern District of Texas, we
now own controlling.interest in Sunshine Mining and your
cause of action is about Sunshine Mining Company, but we
get sued where we live, in Texas.

This does terrible

violence to; the system that has been established by, for
instance, the Texas long arm statute, and also, for instance,
by section 27,

Nationwide service of process under section

27 has a purpose and its purpose is to make Great Western
United be servicable where its securities are issued, and
Sunshine Mining be served where its securities are issued.
It does not have the purpose of making the officials of
Idaho enforcing their own state statutes servicable where

31
their decisions may have an effect.
The precedential effect of that kind of decision
below is overwhelming and for those of us who represent
state officials with regularity, we know that this will
change radically the way states are able to defend them­
selves.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is expired

now, Mrs. Juvller.
MRS. JUVEILER:

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Irwin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IVAN IRWIN, JR., ESC.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. IRWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent here the interests of Great Western
United Corporation, the appellee.

In March of 1911, as Mr.

Heiser has stated, Great Western United Corporation proposed
an interstate tender offer for shares of stock of Sunshine
Mining Company.

Great Western is a Delaware corporation

with its headquarters and principal ownership in Dallas,
Texas.

Sunshine Mining Company was and is a Washington
t

corporation, with business operations in Idaho, in Maryland,
and in New York.
I mention the fact that Sunshine had its place
of incorporation in Washington because Washington had and

32

has no state takeover statute.
The share of Sunshine stock were held by citizens
across the nation, about 2.5 percent residing in Idaho,
about 6 percent in Washington, some 7 percent in Texas and
elsewhere.

Shares were listed and traded on the facilities

of the national securities marketplace.

Great Western was

proposing to pay a premium over the market of $15.75 per
share for up to two million of those shares.
With that backdrop, Great Western complied in all
respects with the provisions of federal law governing the
regulation of interstate cash tender offers pursuant to
the Williams Act Amendments, to the Securities Exchange Act
of 3.934.
Nevertheless, because Sunshine had operations in
these other three states, Idaho, Maryland and New York,
and each one of those states had a state takeover statute,
Great Western could not make the offer upon filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission its schedule 13D, now a
14D-1.
The Idaho Act, which is typical of state takeover
statutes, contains an express

extra territorial provision

which states that no tender offer can be made for shares of
a target company as defined in the Act anywhere in the
world to any shareholder until the Idaho statute has been
complied with.

Now, the extra territorial application of

33
that statute combined with the fact that Maryland and Mew
York had similar statutes constitute the most critical fact
which permeate all of the issues before this Court this day.
QUESTION:

And the coverage of the Idaho statute

was of corporations with their principal place of business
in Idaho, corporations incorporated in Idaho, and what
else?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:
and assets.

Having substantial assets in Idaho.
And this is principal nlace of business?
This was principal place of business

There was an office as well as the mininp; oper­

ations —
QUESTION:

No question as to the coverage of

the —
MR. IRWIN:

No question but that it was covered.

I also would make the point that the triggering mechanism
of the Idaho statute was not the presence of any Idaho share­
holder of Sunshine; it was, rather, the business contacts
between Sunshine and the state.
I feel that I should turn to the questions of
jurisdiction and venue because that was all that was opened
with and —
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Mr. Irwin, may I ask you a question?
Yes.
I understood you to say that the Idaho

34
statute was typical of these state statutes.

In your

brief, on page 20, the first sentence under "Summary of
Argument," is "Unlike any other state statutes" and —
MR. IRWIN:

Any other state statutes other than

state takeover statutes.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, Your Honor.
So you say this is typical of the 22

or 25 other state statutes?
MR. IRWIN:

I think all but about five have this

same extra territorial reach, and I think there are 32
states now which have state takeover statutes.
The District Court had personal jurisdiction over
this case, and venue was nroper.

Great Western had two

avenues available, as has been discussed.

One avenue was

utilizing the general venue statute, 1391(b), and the Texas
long arm statute.

The other avenue, if we had subject

matter jurisdiction under the 1934 Act, an issue, of course,
which is being controverted, was through the nationwide
service of process under the provisions of section 27 of the
1934 Act and service in accordance with Rule 4.
QUESTION:

But even there you had to show that

the defendant was "found," did you not?
MR. IRWIN:

I had to show under section 27 that

an act or transaction had occurred within the district

35
which constituted a violation or breach of duty.
QUESTION:

Well, will you turn to cage 6 of the

jurisdictional statement, please, where I believe section
77 of the Securities Act, it says — it begins on page 5
and ends on page 6 —
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— and it talks first about criminal

proceeding and then it says, "Any suit or action to enforce
any liability" — this is at the beginning of page 6 —
"or duty created by this chanter or rules and regulations
thereunder, or to enjoin any violation of such chanter or
rules and regulations, mau be brought in any such district
or in the district wherein the defendant is found..."

Noxtf,

you say that you can bring it in a district where the
defendant is found or in such district?
MR.

IRWIN:

In any such district, referring back

to the lead-in sentence concerning a criminal nroceeding
may be brought In the district wherein any act or transac­
tion constituting the violation occurred, that is the
criminal proceeding.
QUESTION:

Then you —
So the civil adds-on is broader than

the criminal?
MR. IRWIN:

It refers back to the criminal

district as one place, and then goes further and the
criminal district Is where the act or transaction complained

36
of occurred.
QUESTION:

You are going to tell us what the

violation was, aren’t you?
MR. IRWIN:

And breach of duty, if it may be

characterized that way.
QUESTION:

I say you are going to tell us what

it was?
MR. IRWIN;

Yes.

Would you like ms to do that

now or wait?
QUESTION:

I think it is kind of the heart of

the case.
MR. IRWIN:

All right.

Section 28(a) of the

193^ Act addresses itself specifically to the question of
what securities regulators can do.

It reserved to state

securities commissioners or their counterparts the juris­
diction within their states over securities transactions
so long as the activities of those commissioners was not
in conflict with federal law.
The language itself speaks in terms of jurisdic­
tion is preserved as long as it doesn’t conflict.

Thomas

Corcorran, one of the draftsmen of the ’3^ Act, stated at
the time that section 28(a) was adopted that the nurpose
was to establish and to utilize traditional preemntion
under the supremacy clause.

The statement was that the

state may legislate in addition but may not legislate

37
inconsistently, which is the very foundation of the
supremacy clause.
It is our view that the attempted enforcement by
appellants in this case of a statute which conflicted with
the substantive provisions, the disclosure provisions and
indeed the approaches of Congress as expressed in the
Williams Act Amendments constitutes a breach of the very
affirmative duty which was placed upon securities regulators
not to enact statutes which conflicted.
QUESTION:

What affirmative duty was placed on —

ere you talking about 28(a)?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, I would not read that as placing

any affirmative duty on them.

It says nothing in this

chapter shall affect the jurisdiction except such and such.
Now, that may negate their right to do a particular thing,
but it certainly doesn't place any duty on them, does it?
MR. IRWIN:

I would view it differently.

I would

view it in terms of, as the Fifth Circuit said, the commerce
clause is expressed only as an affirmative grant to Congress
but it contains self-executing restrictions on state power.
QUESTION:

You are saying that an officer who

tries to enforce a state statute

that is in conflict with

a federal statute is violating that duty under the federal
law?

38
MR. IRWIN:

Under* the 1934 Act, if it is a

statute which conflicts with the federal law as embraced
within the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 —
QUESTION:

Well, what about the term you had

the right to be free from state regulation?
MR. IRWIN:

Well, I think the shareholders of

Sunshine had the right to be free from regulation which
blocked this tender offer until the state statute was de­
clared unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

So did your client, I take it?

MR. IRWIN:

My client, of course, wanted the

opportunity — I am not saying we had a right to make a
tender offer free of state regulation.
QUESTION:

No, but you —

MR. IRWIN:

I think the states can regulate in

certain areas in tender offers.

I don’t think that this
*

particular statute, with its infirmities, will stand
constitutional muster.
QUESTION:

Well, normally your comoany in Texas

has a gripe against a state official in Idaho that would
be litigated where?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

It would depend on where the -Normally.

I said normally.

It would

go to where the —
MR. IRWIN:

Normally you would go to where the

39
defendant is located.
QUESTION:

And you would attack the statute

there, wouldn't you?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

We could.
And solely because of the Williams

Act or are you relying on both?
MR. IRWIN:

Well, we are relying upon the con­

stitutional privileges as well as a violation of the Act.
I referred a moment ago to the extra territorial —
QUESTION:

Do you mean due process?

MR. IRWIN:

The supremacy clause and the commerce

clause which we believe the —
QUESTION:
are you?

You are not arguing due process though,

You are not arguing due process.
MR. IRWIN:

I think there is some element of due

process in here, but that was not specifically how we
brought our suit.

A state cannot regulate the affairs of

another state, that is certainly a due process argument
which is implicit —
QUESTION:

Well, if I understand the problem,

that Is exactly what you are doing, that the federal court
in Texas is administering the laws of Idaho or whatever the
state is.
MR. IRWIN:
Texas was doing was

I think what the District Court in

40
QUESTION:

They never did say

—

the Federal

District Court in Dallas is interfering with the laws and
the officials of Idaho.
MR. IRWIN:

That is their complaint.

And our complaint is that the Idaho

regulators by seeking to regulate extra territorially were
damaging the plaintiffs, the federal plaintiffs who brought
the suit in the Northern District of Texas, where the very
restraint occurred.

It is tit for tat.

It Is fair play.

If the Idaho regulators stay at home and regulate within
their state, they are only going to be subject to being
sued in their state.

If they purport to regulate for the

rest of the world and say you can't make a tender offer,
Great Western,.you can't buy a single share of Sunshine
stock from any shareholder anywhere until you come and
comply with Idaho law, and you have to route all of this
commerce around to us, then they should be subject to suit
In the place where they caused their consequences.
QUE55TION:

And you would say that if each of the

other fifty states had exactly the same law and issued the
same order, you think every state should be subject to suit
in at least one place?
MR. IRWIN:

Yes, I do, under the 1966 amendmente

to the general venue statute allowing suit to be brought
where the claim arose.

For the first time, the federal

plaintiff could bring different multi-defendants into a

41
single forum, just as we did in this case through the
application of the general venue statute.

We were faced

with Neiv York, Maryland and Idaho at the inception stages
of this litigation.
QUESTION:

And it is inevitable that if you

spread that widely it is going to be quite inconvenient for
seme one.
MR. IRWIN:

Very inconvenient for someone.

We

do not think that any policy of judicial economy would be
served by Great Western being required to sue one time in
Idaho, one time in Maryland and one time in New York, oar­
ti cularly when the focal point of all —
QUESTION:

Well, how many states have takeover

statutes?
MR. IRWIN:
of the exact number.

Approximately 32 or 33» I am not sure
Mr. Heiser says 36, I will take his

count.
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

That would be four more suits for you.
Right.
Mr.

Irwin, of course you don’t have

to have the law held unconstitutional in this transaction,
I take it?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

No.
Only three of them affected you.

But

the violation, getting back to the question I asked before,

the violation I take it was committed when Mr. Bantie
mailed the letter into Texas, is that right?
MR. IRWIN:
that.

I think it was a little broader than

Mr. Bantie sent a letter into Texas which required

the disclosure of substantial additional information over
and above federal law, and two of the disclosures which
he sought if we had complied would have triggered federal
enforcement action.
we had complied.

We would have violated federal law If

That is one point.

Accompanying the letter was an order.
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

Right.
That order had been entered without

any notice, hearing, posting of bond or other security
which, as held by both courts below, restrains Great Western
from going forward anywhere.
QUESTION:

Well, did Mr. McEldowney, when he

signed that order, violate the federal statute?
MR. IRWIN:

I think by seeking to enforce this

statute he breached the duty or violation, either one —
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

Did he commit a crime?
No, Your Honor.

No, he did not com­

mit a crime.
QUESTION:

Well, you are relying on such District

language from 27 that provides for criminal .jurisdiction,
aren't you?

Ln
MR. IRWIN:

But it is repeated when the civil

jurisdiction provisions of section 28 come into nla.y.
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

Mr. Irwin, is it
First it is in the district where

the violation occurred in criminal proceedings, then it
goes to — it may also be brought — and this is the civil
side of the docket, as I read it, Your Honor — where the
violation, the civil violation occurred, where the breach
of duty occurred or to collect a liability.
QUESTION:

No, it says may be brought in any

such district or in the district wherein the defendant is
found or as an Inhabitant or transacts business.
QUESTION:

Such you think refers to any district

in which a criminal violation could be nrosecuted?
MR. IRWIN:

Or any act or transaction occurred

constitutes a violation.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that would be

limited by the requirement of the Sixth Amendment?
MR. IRWIN:

I am not sure I understand you, Your

QUESTION:

Well, the Sixth Amendment says, as you

Honor.

no doubt know as well as I do, that in all criminal prose­
cutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedv and
public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district
wherein the crime shall have been committed.

Now, I take

it that Congress is bound by that in allocating criminal
jurisdiction under the Securities Act.
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And do you think a crime was committed

in Texas in this case by the state defendants?
MR. IRWIN:
mitted.

I do not.

No, I do not think a crime was com­
1 think it is imnortant for me to re­

member and advise that there have been a number of cases where
venue has been proner under section 27, although there was
no criminal violation involved.
QUESTION:

From this Court?

MR. IRWIN:

No, not In this court.

Court, but in the lower courts.
ing of the lower courts Is sound.

Not in this

And I think the reason­
In the 16(b) area, for

example, suits may be bi’ought under section 27 to collect
the profits which must be disgorged for illegal short-swing
trading, but there is no criminal sanction for such pro­
hibited activity.

But the lower courts reasoned that it

doesn't mean only that there has to be a criminal violation
under section 27, it could also be a civil violation or
breach of duty or something that would lead to the enforce­
ment of a liability.
If I may, if I have answered that question, I will
get back to this question of the first route which we took,
which was the general venue statute where the claim arose.

We believe that the Northern District of Texas
was the focal point of all of appellants' regulatory
activity as well as that of Maryland and New York.

Juris­

diction was obtained under the Texas long arm statute
which has been definitively construed by the Texas Suoreme
Court, in

U-Anchor v. Burt, as going to the full limita­

tion of constitutional due process.

Judge Stakley,

in writing for the Texas Supreme Court on that state issue,
said that the construction does not involve technical and
abstruce definitions of what constitutes doing business.
The United States District Court which heard
this case said that the statute has no commercial imnort.
The appellants would argue that they were not doing busi­
ness.

The statute uses "doing business" as a pick-uo,

pulling in every activity other than what is already
specifically described and, as I said, goes to the full
limits of constitutional due nrocess.
In any event, the business of the Idaho officials,
as Judge Wisdom said, was to regulate.
ment has been held to be doing business.

Hearing oral argu­
Now, I don't

have this case in my brief and I would like to put it into
the record, Wisconsin Telephone Company v. Wisconsin
Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, 228
Northwestern 2d 649, Wisconsin, 1975.
We then turn to a minimum contact analysis under

46
the long arm statute.

It seemed to us that the activities

of the appellants were certainly purposeful.

There was

nothing accidental about the comment letter or the order
which was sent in which restrained us.

The results on

Great Western were certainly foreseeable.

You could cer­

tainly see that if they restrained us, it locked up the
funds, lost the opportunity to go forward.

The cause of

action arose directly out of those activities of the Idaho
regulators.

The causing of purposeful consequences in a

foreign district has been held sufficient under many ap­
plications of minimum contact analyses.
The other avenue which we proceeded was section
27, its interrelationship with section 28(a), our view^ and
the courts below that there was a violation or a breach of
duty by the enforcement of this conflicting statute, there­
fore minimum contacts analysis x^as not required because we
had from Congress the availability of nationwide service
of process.

The sovereign United States can exercise in

personam jurisdiction over its inhabitants.

There would

only be a minimum contact analysis requires if we had been
seeking to sue someone outside of the continental limits
of the United States and. its territories.
Under the section 27 construction by the lower
courts, the act or transaction does not have to be the core
of any wrongdoing or even illegal as long as it is something

47
more than immaterial.

Here the most material aspect of

the Idaho regulation happened in Texas, that is the order
which enjoined us and we would further say that even if
the minimum contact or weight of effects analysis were
proper under section 27, it would be satisfied under the
same analysis under the Texas long arm statute.
QUESTION:

Do you think section 27 gives you the

right to sue?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
A so-called private cause of action?
We would think so.

Great Western —

Do you have to find some section to

be that right or in the securities law or not?
MR. IRWIN:

In order to have subject matter

jurisdiction under the 1934 Act, we would have to find a
section, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, you are suing a state official,

aren't you?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
For interference with what you claim

is a federal right?
MR. IRWIN:

Yes, for violating the federal right,

the federal regulation of tender offers as expressed in
the Williams Act, through a statute which conflicts.
QUESTION:

All this section says is that actions

48
may be brought, any suit or action to enforce any liability
or duty may be brought in some — does that automatically
provide for private causes of action —
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

I don't think it —
— under this entire chapter?
I do not think It automatically does.

I think that —
QUESTION:

What is your authority then for saying

there is a private cause of action here?
MR. IRWTN:

It was Great Western’s tender offer

which was in fact stopped.
QUESTION:

It was —

Well, don’t you have to go back to

find out whether Congress intended that you have a private
cause of action, rather than relating the facts of this case?
MR. IRWIN:

Oh, I see, I understand.

The cause

of action — there have been implied causes of action
under the *34 Act.
QUESTION:

There have been?

Have we ever held

that there was one under this particular section?
MR.

IRWIN:

Not under this section, no.

No,

this is a ease of first Impression in that respect.
I think it also may be important for me to bring
to the Court’s attention something I am bringing late but
nevertheless I think it would be something the Court would
want to look at on its own motion.

Idaho came here,

49
appellants came here under the provisions of section 1254(2),
and that is by way of an appeal

as opposed to making an

application for a writ of certiorari.

That appeal invoked

this Court’s obligatory jurisdiction and under the language
of the statute precludes a writ of certiorari.

The review

on the appeal is limited to the federal questions.

There

is no authority on how wide that federal question issue is.
We would submit it may be — and again I think this is a
case of first impression— that the only federab issue is
the validity of the Idaho statute which was held unconsti­
tutional which furnishes the basis for the utilization of
1254(2).
If that is so, then the provisions of the issues
brought here on jurisdiction and venue are not the federal
question which was to be reviewed under the provisions of
1254(2).
QUESTION:

But if you had no right to sue as a

plaintiff under this statute, then there was never any
occasion to pass on the validity of the Idaho statute.
MR. IRWIN:

May I say that we were not basing

our right to sue on just the 1934 Act.

We were also basing

our right to sue on constitutional privileges under the
supremacy clause and under the commerce clause.

There we

felt we certainly had standing.
QUESTION:

But then you certainly couldn’t invoke

50

section 27 jurisdiction.
MR. IRWIN:

That’s true.

If we don’t have

standing to bring this action because of a violation of
28(a), we can’t use 27 and we have to go to the other al­
ternative which was the general venue statute plus the ap­
plication of the Texas long arm statute, that is correct.
In brief fashion, I would ask the Court to bear
with me for a moment on a preemption analysis, very quickly.
The Williams Act was brought into play in 1563, after
Congress had been deliberating the subject for some three
years.

It was not an area which had been regulated before

by either states or the federal government.

At the time

of the adoption of the Williams Act Amendments, there was
one state takeover statute, Virginia, which had become ef­
fective about two months before.

Congress said it closed

the gap in an area which had not been regulated.

Cash

tender offer phenomena really didn’t occur until the mid­
sixties or maybe early sixties, so this was not an area
which had been traditionally state regulated.
Congress took a market approach, allowing the
tender offeror to make his filing and go direct to the
shareholder at the same time that the incumbent management
was going direct to the shareholder to tell their story to
let the shareholder make his informed decision about taking
cash for his shares.

As a result, Congress considered but

51
rejected prior agency approvals, considered but rejected
pre-effective filing requirements.

Idaho took exactly the

opposite course and has an extensive hearing and pre-filing
requirement which causes the very delay which Congress
didn't want to happen because of the weapon it would give
to incumbent management to discourage delay, take defensive
maneuvers to defeat a tender offer.
Congress also did not seek to have the share­
holder's decision made by any fiduciary.

Idaho took the

opposite approach where the tender offeror must satisfy
either the target management and get their recommendation
or the state regulators, and this particular statute suffers
a further vice in that the incumbent management can deter­
mine whether the state regulator acts or not.

If they

accept the offer, the state regulator cannot call a hearing,
If they don't accept the 'offer they have to call a. hearing.
The enforcement of these differing substantive
and disclosure provisions between Idaho and the Williams
Act and the difference in approaches as found by the
majority opinion in the Fifth Circuit and by the United
States District Judge demonstrates that this tips the
balance of regulatory power in favor of the target manage­
ment, which was not the policy Congress had in mind, and
the Idaho statute stands as an obstacle to the full ac­
complishment and execution of congressional purposes.

52

The preemption analysis was just one of the
analyses that the courts below went through.
one-half the story.

This tells

The commerce clause was also violated,

we believe, by Idaho’s direct regulation out of state of a
cash tender offer involving some $31 million.

Great Western

and shareholders throughout the country could not do busi­
ness with each other until the Idaho law was satisfied.
QUESTION:

If the Idaho statute had been limited

to intrastate activities, would it be preempted, in your
viex«f?
MR. IRWIN:

I don't think so, because I think it

would then operate like the state blue sky law.
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

Exactly.
The constitutionality of which this

Court upheld in 1917 In Hall v. Geiger-Jones.

The effect

of the Idaho regulation put Great Western to a Hobson's
choice.

We could either ignore the letter that came into

the Northern District of Texas and the order and risk sub­
stantial civil and criminal penalties, or we could comply
and accept the delay and the additional burdens and the
jeopardy which would be caused.

We chose to go forward

with the lawsuit because we believed that the enforcement
of this statute had interfered with the area of free trade
which had been established by the commerce clause and
that there were no legitimate local Interests being

53
protected.
Idaho has stated in their brief that they are
protecting shareholders, but that analysis is a little thin.
The Idaho statute does not require the presence in Idaho of
any Idaho investor in a target company, so the very class
of persons Idaho says they are protecting don't have to
exist.
I see my time is up.
QUESTION:

May I ask this question.

MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Your complaint also alleged a cause

of action under 1983-

What is the basis of that?

MR. IRWIN:

We believe

that the delegation by

Idaho under the Idaho Act to the target management of the
right to determine whether or not the Idaho Act would come
into play constituted an unlawful delegation to a vitally
interested private party, a violation of the Civil Rights
Act as expressed in 1983.
QUESTION:

What civil right?

MR. IRWIN:

We believe that there Is a discrim­

ination involved if an outside party Is subject to state
regulationly only at the behest of another private party.
QUESTION:

You still rely on 1983?

MR. IRWIN:
the brief, Your Honor.

We have not brought that forward in

QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Does that mean you have abandoned it?
We have abandoned it.
You haven't brought it forward in your

brief but it is in your complaint, it is a jurisdictional
question.
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Aren't you claiming that you have a

right under the federal securities law that is being
violated?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, but not only under 1983I understand, but that refers to the

federal constitutional — you are certainly claiming that
one of your constitutional rights is being violated under
the commerce clause.
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
of federal laws.

Yes.
And you are suing a state official.
Yes.
And you are also claiming a violation

1983 speaks of constitutional laws of

the United States, doesn't it?
MR. IRWIN:
QUESTION:
MR. IRWIN:

Yes.
Are you sure you are abandoning it?
I will reinstate it.

(Laughter)
MR. IRWIN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Easterbrook.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H. EASTERBROOK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE S.E.C. AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It

please the Court:
The interest of the Securities and Exchange Com­
mission in this case is in determining the validity of the
application of state takeover laws, rather than in identify­
ing the proper forum for this suit.

I will therefore devote

my time to the commerce and supremacy clause arguments.
QUESTION:

If our interest is In Identifying the

proper forum for the suit, I suppose your argument is
largely wasted then.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my argu­

ment would be entirely Toasted if you find that there is no
jurisdiction over this case.

But in the event that five

justices —
QUESTION:

Carry on, Mr. Easterbrook.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

-- concluded there is jurisdic­

tion, I think the Commission would like to be heard on the
merits.

I will address the commerce clause first and then

I will take up the supremacy clause.
The point of the commerce clause Is we think the
creation of a common market.

It forbids states from

vulcanizing the stream of commerce.

More than that, it

56
forbids states from reaching outside their borders to af­
fect the flow of commerce elsewhere.
Idaho's law affects an interstate market in se­
curities.

Its law applies to securities that are being

traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Its law applies to

an offer by somebody residing in Texas to buy sah es from
somebody else residing in Texas, and the application of
this law doesn’t simply, as in most commerce clause cases
that come to this Court, affect local commerce but produce
ripples elsewhere that are felt in other states.
This is a case in which the very purpose of the
state rule is to reach outside the borders of Idaho and
tell people in Texas and New York and Florida whether and
when they can buy securities from one another.

It is as

If the state passed a blue sky law and said ordinarily you
can decide not to deal in our state if you decide not to
file our state registration statement, but we conclude that
in order to protect the residents of Idaho from being
eliminated or excluded from valuable opportunities to buy
stock, no one can offer stock for sale In Texas unless he
files a registration statement and sells It in Idaho as
well, otherwise our residents are left out.
Idaho indeed extolls the extra territorial reach
of its laws as being justified by just such a purpose.
That kind of justification has been rejected by this Court,

57
we think.

It may be that the best example of that is

Baldwin v. GAP Selig, one of the incredible series of New
York milk cases that detained this Court for some twenty
years.

New York tried to increase the selling price of

milk in New York by requiring New York wholesalers of milk
to treat the wholesale price of milk, even if bought outof-state, the same as the New York control price of milk.
The Court analyzed the case that New York was trying to
tell buyers and sellers in Vermont what price they should
charge for milk if the milk ended up in New York, and the
fact that the milk ended up in New York produced a very
substantial contact with the State of New York, the sub­
stantiality of which was not disputed by anyone.

The milk

had contact with New York, just as Sunshine has substantial
contacts with Idaho.
But the Court rejected any notion that New York
could attempt to influence the course of commerce in Vermont,
no matter how much the course of commerce in Vermont might
ultimately have an effect on what happened in New York.
That is exactly what Idaho is trying to do here, it is try­
ing to influence the course of conduct in Texas, and in New
York on the ground that that conduct ultimately has reper­
cussions in Idaho, and the statute fails for the same reason,
we think.
But even if this statute were treated as one that

58
applied wholly to a state’s domestic commerce and merely
produced its ripples elsewhere, it would be invalid because
the ripples are great and the justifications for the act
small.
Idaho argues, for example, that it has the goal
of protecting Idaho shareholders.

One of the anomlies of

the statute thoup;h is that it is not triggered by the
presence of any shareholder in Idaho.
there were no shareholder in Idaho.

It would apply if
On the other hand, the

statute does not apply if the takeover offer is consented
to by the management of the company, even if the management
of the company is found in Washington State.

And so in

those cases Idaho shareholders receive no protection.
What is more is that what Idaho tries to do in a
case like this is protect the two percent of the share­
holders who live in Idaho only by requiring the 98 percent
of the shareholders who live in New York

and Texas and

Florida to forego what they may find to be a valuable op­
portunity.
The only other justification advanced by the state
is that Its statute will protect civic-minded businesses
or local commerce, health and safety and the like.

That

amounts to, we think, discrimination against Interstate
commerce for its own purpose, is an exaltation of the
values of local isolationism from the stream of commerce,

59
and that is the kind of justification that was projected
in Philadelphia v. New Jersey last term.
The point of this argument has been that Idaho
has had substantial extra territorial intent, effect and
scope of its statute.

It is those kinds of things that

ought to be regulated by Congress if they are regulated at
all.

In fact, Congress has regulated them, and that brings

me to the point under the supremacy clause.
In order to evaluate the argument which we make
here that the state law is preempted by the Williams Act,
it is necessary first, we think, to understand why people
make tender offers.

Tender offer is a public offer to buy

shares at more than they will fetch in the market.

A

person ordinarily makes such an offer only if he is persuaded
that the shares will be worth more in his hands than they
are worth held and distributed to the public at large.

That

may be because incumbent management is inefficient and
mismanaging the company and in that event the value of the
shares will increase if new management is substituted by
the offeror.

It may be that tax considerations would make

the shares more valuable in some hands than others if, for
example, the target has operating loss carryovers.
Whatever the reason, and there may be many, the
offer is relying on an increment in value.

The problem is

that it is very costly for firms to go out and identify

6o
such cases where there may be an increment in value and they
don’t accept those costs unless there is some prospect of
return.

The prospect of return has to be discounted by the

risk that the offer will be a failure.

The greater the

risk, the more return there has to be to make the offer
worthwhile.
In order to realize the gain that he has identi­
fied, the offeror has to make the public offer and pay more
than the shares bring in the market, not too much more,
though, and this is the difficulty from the offeror’s point
of view because if he offers the entire increment of profit
to the current shareholders, the highest possible price,
there is nothing left for him, no incentive to do the
searching, no incentive to make the offer, and without an
offer, of course, the shareholders will get nothing at all.
So the closer any rule trios to drive the price
to the maximum price of what it is worth to the offeror,
the less likely the offer is to occur in the first place,
and more likely the shareholder is to end up with nothing.
Time is of the essence in the tender offer pro­
cess and so is the opportunity to have a fair fight between
the offeror and the incumbent management.

It is most likely

that the incumbent management feels its own personal pre­
requisites and positions at stake.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, if a tender offer is

61
always so beneficial to stockholders, as you suggest, why
did Congress enact the Williams Act?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice Powell, there is

substantial legislative history to indicate that Congress
thought that tender offers were quite beneficial if con­
ducted under a set of rules that allowed the shareholders
to make an informed judgment.
QUESTION:

They have often been beneficial, but

they have often been quite adverse.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

That’s right.

The difficulty

lies in determining how that judgment is going to be made.
One can construct a set of rules

— • there is going to be

an offer, there Is going to be a response by the target
management — one can construct a set of rules under which
someone, usually the shareholders, has to make up his mind
whether the offer is beneficial or not, whether there Is
that Incrementive value.

And the Williams Act was an

attempt to set up that set of rules under which shareholders
could make that determination^
The pro rata provisions, the seven-day withdrawal
provisions, the disclosure provisions were intended to
allow shareholders to make that judgment, but it was a
judgment that was to be made in the context of information
from both offeror and the target management, the ultimate
decision to be made by the shareholders.

The difficulty in

62
regulating in that way is to set up a system of regulation
so that the shareholders can make that choice without at
the same time so setting up regulatory rules that the number
of beneficial tender offers is reduced and there are fewer
opportunities for shareholders to make their judgments.
Congress’ assessment was that the best combination
of protection for shareholders and insurance that tender
offers would not be eliminated altogether was a set of dis­
closure rules coupled with prompt start of the offer, and
Congress explicitly considered and just as explicitly re­
jected a variety of pre-offer notification rules or a
variety of rules of a sort that would require the Securities
and Exchange Commission to pass on the adequacy of dis­
closure before the tender offer could begin.
But given the necessity of making the kind of
balance, actually a rather fine-tuned one, Congress had in
mind in the Williams Act, must follow, we think, that a
state cannot use the very devices that Congress rejected
as detrimental to the interests of investors, because then
the state defeats precisely what it was that Congress had
in mind to achieve.
Idaho is simply not free to strike a difference
balance on how best to achieve that.

Congress recognized,

however, that what it said In the Williams Act was not the
last word and it gave the Securities and Exchange

63
Commission a substantial rulemaking power.

In fact, almost

every one of the provisions of the Williams Act is coupled
with granted rulemaking power to the Commission to alter it,
to change it in some way.
In entrusting that rulemaking task, the finetuning task to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Congress set up a system of regulation that is very closely
related in concept to the system this Court considered last
year in Ray v. ARCO, a Washington supertanker case.

In

Ray, the Secretary of Transportation had decided not to set
up a rule under which super tankers were forbidden to enter
Puget Sound and had decided not to use his rulemaking
powers, although he surely had them, to set up a rule re­
quiring double bottoms, twin screws, and the like.
Washington then required those things and gave as a rationale
the argument that it was simply increasing protection of
the environment, the very same thing Congress had in mind
in passing its statute, and it wanted to view that the
congressional statute and the Secretary's regulation was
minimum guarantees of environmental safety with the state
adding additional guarantees of environmental safety.
Court rejected that argument.

This

The reason it rejected it

was because the Secretary of the Treasury had the same
power to assess and weigh the benefits of safety against
the convenience of commerce, and it said that the state

could not add where the Secretary had said there should
not be additional protections.
And that is really the same setup as works under
the Williams Act.

The Commission is free to provide addi­

tional period to increase the length during which a tender
offer may be open, it is free to promulgate a great number
of other regulations that will have the effect of assessing
the benefit to investor against whatever detriment to
commerce may be caused.

And it is because the Commission

has that authority and because it has decided to exercise
it in a way that does not provide the kinds of things that
Idaho has provided, the Idaho statute is preempted, we
submit, and therefore under both the supremacy clause and
the commerce clause, if the Court reaches the merits here,
we submit that it should affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.
QUESTION:
Mr.

Mr. Easterbrook, do you agree with

Irwin that if the Idaho statute had been limited to

intrastate activities that it would have been valid?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The Commission’s position is

that even if it were limited to intrastate activities, it
would be preempted by the Williams Act.
QUESTION:

Has the Commission taken that posi­

tion previously to this case?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I am sorry, Mr. Justice, I

65
don't know whether it took it before this case, but that
is the Commission's position.
QUESTION:

So the Commission's position is that

all 36 state laws are invalid?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It is, Your Honor.

That

should be distinguished though, I think, from the Commis­
sion's position under the commerce clause.

The position

under the commerce clause allows states substantial authority
to regulate within the state for the same reason that in
Hall v. Geiger-Jones the commerce clause permitted blue
sky laws.

On top of that, I think it is important to

point out that the Commission does not argue that all state
laws touching on takeovers are preempted.

For example, a

state lav/ requiring any statements by offeror or management
to be fair, adequate and so on, similar to or tracking
federal lav/ could be enforced in —
QUESTION:

Any state law that makes additions to

the requirements of the Williams Act could be invalid
under that analysis?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
not of that view.

No, I think the Commission is

It is any state law that makes additions

of the sort that disrupt the balance of investor protection
established in the Williams Act.
QUESTION:
within the state?

Even If limited only to stockholders

66
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor.

But I think

it is important to point out, and I think it should be
clear that in the Commission's view there are a number of
possible state statutes that would not disrupt the balance.
Take, for example, the state statute that says any corpora”
tlon incorporated in this state shall respond to tender
offers only by a two-thirds vote of the board of directors
or any of the other things regulating the affairs between
the corporation and its shareholders would in most cases
not be preempted by the Williams Act.
simply does it touch tender offers.
field preemption argument.

The test is not
We are not making a

The test is whether it upsets

or undermines the careful balancing that Congress has done
and its assessment of where the interests of investors lie.
QUESTION:

Would it make a difference if the

state statute is limited to corporations incorporated
under the laws of that state?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I think that would substan­

tially reduce the opportunities for disrupting the balance
that has been created by Congress.

The difficulties in

allowing the state to regulate even those offers that are
made to its oxm citizens might arise if, for example, New
York, where 35 percent of shareholders lie, has a statute
saying you must do A, California, who has another 30 per­
cent, has a statute saying you can't do A, and each tries

67
to tug the balance In a slightly different way.

The op­

portunities for that, when more than one state can enter
the picture on one tender offer, are really quite substan­
tial and it is for that reason that the Commission says
that even as applied to shareholders within the state the
acts are in many cases preempted by the Williams Act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Heiser, you have

a few minutes left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER E. HEISER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS—REBUTTAL
MR. HEISER:

As a preliminary matter, Mr. Chief

Justice, I would like to point out to the Court that the
typewritten brief of the Securities and Exchange Commission
was only received by us on the 5th of April, with corrections
on the 9th of April, the printed brief we were able to pick
up a copy here yesterday, have not received it yet.

I

would like to request that I have an opportunity to respond
to that brief in written form, if the Court would grant me
that opportunity.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may respond, if

you wish, in the usual way.
MR. HEISER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

One of the frustrations that the Idaho appellants
have in this case is that the Securities and Exchange

68
Commission, where it had a real opportunity to provide en­
lightenment for this Court as to what section 27 really
involves and what section 28 conflict may mean in their
terms Ignored those issues.

And like the courts below,

because of the fascination of the merits, which certainly
are fascinating, lept right into the constitutional ques­
tions.
Unfortunately in doing that, they used some of
the cliches and terms that have been used all along with
regard to these state laws which have had a salutary effect.
Talk about the term delay.

State laws have prolonged the

period during which tender offers are open.

The net result

of that has been in the period between 197^ and 1976 of a
$1.2 billion premium to the shareholders as a result of
that extended period of time.
But the point that we really have focused here is
that we have a Texas corporation that wanted to take over a
controlling interest in a corporation that was subject to
jurisdiction under the Idaho corporate takeover law and
the Texas corporation, with operations In Texas, knew and
recognized that Idaho law was going to have jurisdiction.
They came to Idaho to submit themselves to the jurisdiction
of that Idaho law and then, when they didn’t get the im­
mediate approval that they wanted, their reaction to test
the constitutionality of the Idaho law "was down in Texas,

69
and that is unfortunately what creates the problem in this
case.
We shouldn’t be having to be concerned about
defending the action in Texas because it shouldn’t have
been brought in Texas.
Idaho.

It should have been brought in

And If a corporation like Great Western United

wants to do3 as it does, business In many states, then it
should be prepared to conform to the problems that it may
be presented ifith by the laws of those states, and if it
has constitutional challenges to the laws of those states,
it is perfectly free to go into the federal courts in those
states or the state courts in those states and raise those
constitutional challenges.
QUESTION:

By the same token, of course, the

respondent company, says that what Idaho did had a direct
Impact upon what the respondent wanted to do in the State
of Texas.
MR. REISER:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, what the

respondent wanted to do was not only in the State of Texas
but —
QUESTION:

MR. HEISER:

And in the other 49 states also.
Exactly.

And under the rationale

advanced by the courts below, then because of the effect
and all of the other 49 states, they more than likely could
have brought suit In any of the other 49 states and we

70

could have been defending; an action in Vermont or Hawaii
or Alaska or Florida, as well as Texas, because Great
Western United wanted to secure shares of stock from share­
holders in those states.

So the problem becomes the forum

shopping problem and that really is not what we feel the
federal law was designed for, and it certainly isn’t what
we feel the Texas long arm statute and the accompanying
federal venue statute were designed for.

That is the whole

point.
The U-Anchor case that the Texas Supreme Court
recently decided that construed the Texas long arm statute,
it is absolutely true that they said that the Texas long
arm statute goes to the full limits of due process.
was the context of the case?

A contract,

What

one of the

specifically defined terms that constitutes doing business
under the Texas long arm statute. The threshold first level
of

inquiry under the Texas long arm statute was satisfied

sc they didn't have to waste time on deciding whether it
was an act of doing business in Texas because it fell within
the actual definition.

But \irhat the court1 did do in U-Anchor

was finding that, yes, the facts technically satisfy our
jurisdictional prerequisite in the Texas long arm statute
as a doing business context.
I am out of time.
