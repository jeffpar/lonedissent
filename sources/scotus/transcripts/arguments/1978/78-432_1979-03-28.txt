MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments first

this morning in No. 7,8-432, United Steelworkers against Brian
Weber, and the consolidated cases.
Mr. Powers, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOYES

THOMPSON POUTERS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER KAISER ALUMINUM & CHEMICAL
CORPORATION
MR. POUTERS; Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court s
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Title VII

of

And the issue is whether

the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits an employer

and a union to remedy the past exclusion of minorities and
women from craft employment by establishing a new craft training
program which takes account of race and sex in selecting those
to be trained.
Let me begin by stating one central fact.

The pro­

visions of the 1974 Kaiser Steelworker labor agreement, which are
being challenged in this case, were a remedial measure adopted
in response to employment discrimination litigation concerning
the lack of minorities and women in craft
are not

employment.

Those

simply my words.They are contained in the provisions

of the labor agreement itself, and they appear in paragraph 5
of Plaintiff's Complaint in this case, which is reprinted in
the Appendix of page 11, and they were renewed not only by the

4
Company but by the Union in its answer to the complaint, which
appears on page 17 of the Joint Appendix.
So the character of the program is not really in
dispute.

It was re-namedf and it sought to do more than remedy

for achieved racial balance for society’s sake.

The program was

explicitly focused in response to employment discrimination
Litigation in which both Kaiser and Steelworkers were then en*

gaged.
To meet the situation, the Kaiser-Steelworker Agreement
established a new program at 15 Company plants under which
Kaiser employees who had no prior craft experience could achieve
training.

And, as was being done in the Steel Consent. Decree,

to which the Steelworkers were a party, the agreement provided
that 50 percent of the training opportunities would be allotted
to minorities and women.

'

One of those 15 plants is the Gramercy, Louisiana
plant

and which is the site of this litigation.
It is important to emphasize that the Company’s desire

to assure compliance with its Title VII and its Executive
Order obligations were not simply involved in the establishment
of the 1974 program, they were the reason for it.

If the

Company had been able to recruit what it regarded as adequate
tmmbers of minorities and women who were already equally
trained, they would have had ever reason to continue to take
advantage of its ability to recruit fully-trained craftsmen

5
and save a substantial cost that the training involved.
As is clear from the record, at the Gramercy plant
alone, by agreeing to this training program, the Company under­
took an obligation that could be expected to cost it up to
;?400,000 a year.
Now, this training program provided opportunities not
only for Blacks and women, but for white males who had no prior
craft experience.

The Respondent, Brian Weber, was one of those

employees who had no prior craft experience.And when oppor­
tunities came to bid in this new craft training program, he bid.
And when he was not selected, he filed a charge under Title VII
alleging that he was being discriminated against because Blacks
less senior than he had been selected.
The lower courts-—
QUESTION;

Mr. Powers, I want to be sure that Kaiser

is or is not admitting past discrimination?
MR, POWERS:
tion.

Kaiser does not admit past discrimina­

It does concede that both the substantial level of

employment of minorities and women in craft jobs at the time
and the fact it had insisted on prior experience as a condition
not only for employment as a full craftsman, but also for
entry into training programs, were factors that a Court might
have used in finding that there was a prima facie case of
discrimination,
QUESTION:

Beyond this, Kaiser does not go?

6

MR. POWERSs
under Title VII.

Kaiser does not concede discrimination

It does not concede

that the Executive Order

required this action.
QUESTION:

I don't know — do you concede that the

Eigures would have made out a prima facie case requiring Kaiser
to come forward with some explanation?
MR. POvJERS s

We certainly would concede that it is

arguable and I think the Fifth Circuit's decision in force
against Kaiser which involved a neighboring plant of Kaiser to
the Gramercy plant, and one that was also subject to this 1974
agreement, shows that Courts could reach that conclusion.
QUESTION:

I'm not asking whether ultimately you

concede that you could not make out any defense.
concede that these figures

But do you

would make a prima facie case that

would require you to come forward?
MR. POWERS:
facie case.

I don't concede that there is a prima

We do recognize that there are the elements

that

a Court might use to find such a prima facie case.
There are two points that we have to stress at this
time:

In our judgment, the standard which the Fifth Circuit

adopted and which the lower court and which the Respondents
argued for, that there must be a proof of prior discrimination
and an identification of the victims of that discrimination
will literally end affirmative action.

If that is the price

employers and unions must pay in order to try to remedy the

7
exclusions of the past, it is, in our judgment, prohibitive.
Secondly, we consider that the type of remedial action
that was taken in this case is consistent with the standards
which a majority of this Court approved in the Bakke Case and are
otherwise reasonable.
QUESTION:
with this one.
Court

The Bakke Case really has nothing to do

The Bakke Case was decided by a majority of the

on the equal protection clause under the Fourteenth

jUxiendment, which is wholly inapplicable here, isn't it?
MR. POWERS:

We believe, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that the standard is no stricter

for

proving race-

conscious action—
QUESTION: Our problem here ai lawyers and judges
is quite different, isn’t it?

It doesn't involve the equal

protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment at all.
I

MR. POWERS:

I does not involve the equal protection

clause.
QUESTION:
MR. POWERS:
QUESTION:

It involves the 1964 Act of Congress.
That is correct.

!

It is pretty clear — it's entirely clear,

l suppose, that, setting to one side

the post Civil War

legislation, that until 1964 your client could have had a
training program for all white people, all women, all Negroes,
or all anything else, and it's only because of this Act of
Congress that this lawsuit arises; isn't it?

8

MR. POWERS:
QUESTION:
MR. POWERS:
QUESTION:
conceded?

That is correct.
Nothing to do with the Constitution?
That is our position,
Well, that's clear, isn't it?

Isn't that

That is not only your position, that's the fact of

t;he matter, isn't it?
MR. POWERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, we agree with that.
And really the very narrow question, you

could have done this, as my brother Stewart said, before 1964?
MR. POWERS:
QUESTION:

There’s no question.
The only narrow, and very narrow question

is whether the 1964 Act permits you to do it?
MR, POWERS:
QUESTION:
MR. POWERS:
,

QUESTION:
MR. POWERS:

That is correct,
That's all there is to the case.
In our judgment—
Isn’t that all there is to the case?
I believe it is all.

And we would say,

furthermore, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan, that we believe,
far from prohibiting this type of action, we believe that
Title VII encourages it,
QUESTION:

Mr. Powers, supposing that the answers you

have given to my brother

White's and Blackman's questions

previously were different, that there wasn't even any arguable
showing that your Company had discriminated in the past, do you
think the program you instituted in 1974 would be permissible

9

under Title VII?
MR. POWERS:

We believe that Title VII

may require

employers to take action which prevents them from importing
into their own work force discrimination which others have — are
responsible for.

We believe that that is certainly the way the

Executive Order seems to have been interpreted and upheld.
QUESTION:
MR. POWERS:

Title VII isn't the Executive Order, is it?
It is not.

But it is our understanding

rhat. the two are to be construed -- are to be reconciled.
as we read the legislative history of Title VII

And

and the '64

.Legislative history, Congress was aware that there was an
Executive Order and it sought to provide

that that program,

.Including the affirmative action elements of it, would be
allowed to continue.
QUESTION:

So you say that even though nobody could

have made out even a prima facie case of discrimination against
your Company in court, nonetheless,

this agreement was per­

missible under Title VII?
MR, POWERS:
QUESTION:
MR. POWERS:

Well, my point is this:

That we—

Can you answer the question?
Yes, sir.

My difficulty is simply, in

responding to you as to whether or not the employer can be
charged with discrimination when he acts in such a way that
brings the practices of others into his own workplace. Some
would say that that creates a prima facie case of discrimination

10

on the part of that employer.

It isn’t what the employer has

initiated, but what he perpetuates in his workplace.
To the extent that that creates a prima facie case
of discrimination, then that is the situation that’s comparable
to the one in which Kaiser found itself.

It was trying to

utilize the experienced craftsmen trained by others under
conditions which, it seems to me, were clearly recognized as
being discriminatory,
QUESTION:

You think to the extent it creates

discrimination, what’s your position as to whether it does or
does not create that situation?
MR. POWERS:
Mr. Justice White,

I come back to my first answer to

We deny that the Company discriminated.

We

recognize that there are questions as to whether certain conduct
may be regarded as creating a prima facie case of discrimination
that requires justification.

We think that employers and

anions must be allowed to take this kind of remedial action,
recognizing that the outcome of litigation may be in doubt.
QUESTION:

The employers and unions could do it if

Congress would let them do it.

Is that not so?

MR. POWERS: We believe that the Congress could
specifically authorize this type of action.

It is our position

that it did not prohibit it.
QUESTION:

Suppose, for example, Congress had a

statute — which I won’t try to draft a statute here — but

11

something to this effects

That provided, however, applying to

all existing statutes, that nothing in these statutes would
prohibit the employer unilaterally or by contract with the
union from

agreeing to carry out a program of the kind you have

here, with preferential treatment to minorities who have been
denied equal opportunity in the past, in order to remedy that.
Now, there wouldn’t be any State action in that, would there?
MR. POUTERSs

Well, I suppose that legislation would

have to pass the equal protection standards.

We believe that

if an adequate basis was laid--"
QUESTION:

Do you think that would run afoul of any

constitutional prohibition?
MR. POWERS:
question.

Well, I mentioned the equal protection

It seems to me if there is an adequate basis in

finding that this remedial action is necessary, it would be up­
held.
QUESTION:

I was thinking of the statutory recitals

of past discrimination and exclusion

including

the long­

standing union activities that prohibited minorities, particular­
ly, Negroes, from getting uvto apprentice programs, or even
membership in the union.
MR. POWERS:

We would think that would be

constitutional,
Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to defer the balance
of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H„ GOTTESMAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES STEELWORKERS

OF AMERICA. AFL-CIO-CLC
MR. GOTTESMANs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

:he Courts
The cast that's here today reflects one small part
of what was a nationwide program undertaken by the Steelworkers
Union

in 1974,

In that year, it negotiated not just with this

Company, and not just with this industry, but with all the
major industries the union represented*
this at every plant

A program similar to

providing that where a racial imbalance

exists as between the production jobs and the crafts jobs, a
quota would be instituted wherein 50 percent of those jobs,
<.
!•

the craft jobs and craft training jobs to minorities until that
imbalance had been eliminated.
The union has since reconfirmed its commitment to
■chat program

in three successive conventions despite arguments

against that program,

from delegate Brian Weber, at the most

recent convention, which
in this case»

followed the Tenth Circuit's decision

And the union is most anxious to sustain as

lawful its right to negotiate contracts of this type.
Now, the union's view as to what Title VII permits
is somewhat different from that of the Company,

And it's

13

broader.

In our view, Congress, in prohibiting discrimination

:Ln Title VII, did not intend to prohibit any form of, and I!m
going to call it, affirmative action.

Congress did not intend

to take from private employers and unions the right to adopt
a program

wherein they had a segregated workforce, regardless

of whether that segregation was their own fault, the fault of
other societal factors, and without the need of having to con­
duct a major investigation to trace just what the cause of that
segregation was.

That the mere existence of that segregation

was an undesirable phenomenon

which that Company and Union

could address.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gottesman, let me ask you this:

Suppose that when Title VII was adopted there was an employer
who said to himself, "I think just to be fair, I'm going to
have my 'workforce mirror the racial composition of the community
Insofar as Blacks and whites are concerned"?

Suppose it was

70-30, and he hired on that basis all the time, and he maintained
as nearly as he could 70-30.

Then Title VII occurred.

I

take

:Lt your position would be that that would not be invalid under
Title VII?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

No, on the contrary, we think that

would be, so long as permissive action is merely a standard.
It is not that an employer and union can opt as a permanent
matter forever to hire

on a racial basis.

It is not that they

can maintain a racial balance for its own sake

14
QUESTION?

You are still opposing it then as a

remedy?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

In the sense that a segregated work­

force is a bad thing to have, it’s something you ought to be
able to remedy.

But not necessarily remedial in the sense,

"We’ve committed a sin, therefore, we have to correct it.,!
QUESTIONS

Is there any history, Mr. Gottesman, of

this Union having done as many unions did, the trade unions, for
example

excluding Negroes, particularly, from membership in the

union ?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

On the contrary, Your Honor, it’s

history is it was built with Black members first.
1930’s and 40fs,

And in the

when it was against the law in the South to

conduct integrated meetings, the leadership of this union was
dragged off to jail every month because the union refused to
hold segregated meetings, even though the law required it.

And

there is no history, and this is important to our problem, it
was completely interracial.

There's no question about it from

the start, this union never segregated in any respect.

Never,

tor is there any question that this union had no responsibility
for the picture of exclusion from the craft.

Unfortunately, the

companies would not give the union a voice in crafts elections.
So the union didn’t have the opportunity, even if that had been
ils intent, to commit discrimination.
The union has been fighting for years, as this record

15

shows, to get this Company to institute training programs, so
that whites and Blacks in the plant would be able to qualify
for the craft jobs,
QUESTION?

There is no doubt, is there, that quite

a number of unions had a systematic exclusion in past years in
this respect?
MR, GQTTESMAN;
in industrial unions.

I think, Your Honor, it is not correct

There are findings by courts that soma

And companies testified at the trial that the only

So this element of

societal discrimination is the source-—

MR. GQTTESMAN:

get the employer to

And the union

The union negotiates to

adopt craft training programs as one of the

benefits it provides to its employees.
Now, if I may, our position is a little broader in
terms of what we say Congress allows to private parties.

Our

position is that wherever you have a segregation in your work­
force, you may adopt a temporary quota to eliminate it and the
desirability to convince those Courts that Congress did leave
that area unregulated in *64.
As Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out, there* is no
question that until 1964, companies and unions could do this.
QUESTION:

Then you would agree with your colleague

who just said that Congress could easily clarify this?
MR. GOTTESMANs

Well, no matter what this Court does,

Congress can easily clarify it if this Court's decision doesn't
coincide with what Congress believes to be the right result.
The question is, at this moment in time with the statute now
on the books, what can we discern to have been Congress' intent
coday.

17

And then we look at the history of Title VII.

The

decision that Congress made in '64 was not to take the
choice to have programs such as this from the private sector.
There was some language that Section 703(a) and (d) do indeed
say it would be an unlawful employment practice to discriminate
against individuals in employment and in training.
suppose the ultimate question is 2

And so I

What did Congress mean

when

it used the word "discriminated"?
QUESTIONS

Under the present statute, could an employer

lawfully announce and execute a program saying that he would
hire approximately 50 percent people who had been convicted of
criminal acts and were released either on preliminary parole or
permanently released?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

This statute only

prohibits discrimina­

tion on the basis of sex, race, national origin—
QUESTION:

So in that range of 50 percent you would

get a wide range of racial groups, wouldn't
MR. GOTTESMANs
QUESTION;

you,ethnic groups?

Sure.

There would be no prohibition? an employer

could do that?
MR. GOTTESMAN;

I would think, unless it were a

subterfuge for some type of invidious discrimination.
QUESTION;

I'm sorry.

I was hypothesizing an employer

who consciously and deliberately wanted to try and help
rehabilitate people who had been—

18

MR. GOTTESMAN:

There is nothing in this statute

that precludes that, Your Honor, as I understand it,
QUESTIONS

Is there any other statute that you know

of?
MR. GOTTESMAN: I can't say that I do.

But I don't

have confidence that I know all the statutes that might come
into play.

There has been evidence in the legislative history

■ihat when Congress moved, it had in mind what some people call
"invidious discrimination^ not just the literal sense, there
is a choice to make in an act of discrimination.
Congress talked about acts of ugliness and intolerance,
bigotry, bias, prejudice as the kinds of acts that this statute
was directed at.

But more than just their own obvious ambiguity

in the word "discriminate” in 703(a) and (d), and you

want

to look at the legislative history, in any event, to find out
what Congress intended-"
QUESTION:

Mr. Gottesman, I know that your ultimate

position is this simply is not a violation of Title VII of the
1964 Act, but, despite what you have just told us, isn't it,
on its face, prima facie a violation?

It is an evident

'discrimination against white people, isn't it?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, it is a race conscious decision

which—
QUESTION:

In training.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

—which requires the selection of

19

Blacks rather than whites in certain instances.
QUESTION:

Which is—

MR. GOTTESMAN:

In the literal sense, it is discrimina-

■;ion.
QUESTION:

So what you have said, I assume, in a

lawsuit would be defensive; wouldn’t it?

And a Plaintiff, be

:Lt Mr. Weber or any other plaintiff similarly situated, could
bring a lawsuit.

This is a prima facie color violation and what

you said would be a complete defense; is that correct?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, one could say it that way.

Our

defense though would be no more than simply saying that we have
a segregated workforce and we have adopted a quota which does no
more than eliminate that.
QUESTION:

Precisely.

MR, GOTTESMAN:

And that is not ™ once we have shown

that, that is not discrimination as Congress intended that
term.
QUESTION:
discrimination,

Well, Aether

may j-,e or may not ^e

it is not a violation of Title VII; is that

;„t?
MR. OGTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

Okay.

Correct,

That is correct.

How much is left of McDonald if you

prevail?
MR. OTTESMAN:

McDonald prohibits the kind of

discrimination against whites that Congress passed this statute

20

•:o prohibit against Blacks.

Acts of ugliness, intolerance,

bigotry, bias, prejudice.
The legislative history shows, and the legislative
history from which this Court found in McDonald—
QUESTION;

What you’re saying, under your theory,

you can discriminate for a good motive; you can't discriminate
for a bad motive?
MR. GOTTESMANs

Well, it's not so much the motive,

there are certain acts taken in certain circumstances which
Congress did not intend to forward in theprohibition of this
statute.
And there is another provision on the face of this
s-tatute terribly important to that assessment, and that is
703(j), in which Congress said, "Nothing in this Act requires
an employer and the union to adopt a quota to eliminate racial
.•Imbalance.5'
Noxtf, while it may not be

definitive that it’s

worded that way, it’s hard to believe that the drafters of
that provision, if they thought it would be unlawful to adopt
a quota, would have chosen a set of words "Nothing in this
Act requires an employer and union" to do it.
QUESTION;

Wouldn’t it have been quite easy for

Congress to express these concepts in the terms I outlined in a
very rough suggestion of a statute?
MR. GOTTESMANs

It would have been easy, Your Honor.

21

It would have been easier for both us and the Court if they
had done so.

But we suggest that, indeed, in the legislative

history the principal sponsors made clear that that is, in fact,
what they intended.
Now, it's an important dynamic to understanding that
legislative history that the balance of power here was held by
a group of conservative Congressmen whose votes were critical
and who normally were resistant to Government regulation of
business.

And who stated it as a credo, this is the price of

support for this Bill.

"Look, these are evils and we want

to eradicate these evils, and we are prepared to vote with you
to do so.

But we have got to do so with the minimum intrusion

necessary upon management prerogatives and union credos.

And

since this, what we are doing here, was not the evil which was
*

in Congress* sights when it enacted this statute, it was not
the view of these people that the freedom which employers and
the union previously had

to adopt a program like this would

be taken away.
And the most compelling answer to that was the
explanation provided by Representative McGregor, who was one
of the leading House Members of the Judiciary Committee
shepherding this Bill through,
before the vote on this Bill.

and he spoke literally moments
And, indeed, on the same day

the Bill was enacted and signed by the President, he said,
51 As important as the scope and extent of this Bill is, it is

22

vitally important that all Amaricans understand what this Bill
does not cover.15

And then he listed the areas of racial

balancing in public schools and preferential treatment or quotas
in employment.

And I'm going to come back to that linkage.

And he said, "There is a mistaken belief that Congress is
Legislating in these areas in this Bill.

When we drafted this

Bill, we excluded these issues."
He went on to say, "These are controversial."
QUESTION:

Then why did you answer me awhile ago the

way you did, that an employer with a racially balanced work­
force would be violating Title VII?
MR. GOTTSSMAN:
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I said he would be—

You said he was.

MR. GOTTSSMAN:

I asked you—

I may have over-stated my view.

That

is a totally different question from whether you can do what
we’re doing.
QUESTION:

Well, it may be, but the words you are

reading there, read on my example too, don't they?
MR. GOTTSSMAN:

Well, except I

think — what

Congressman McGregor said was that Congress had spelled out ■—
the Senate had spelled out in 703(j) our intentions more
specifically.

And what 703(j) said was not -— did not address

maintaining racial balance.

It said nothing in this statute

will require you to adopt a quota to eliminate a racial imbalance.
And so what Congressman McGregor was saying is that's

23

the area we have carved out and left to the private sector.

We

have done so not because we think it's necessarily good or
necessarily bad, but because it's controversial and we decided
not to take that choice away from where it has traditionally
resided — in the hands of employers and unions.
Now, if I can be allowed, and I know I am at my end,
30 seconds to note the posture in which this case is really
before this Court.

There is a lot of evidence cited in our

QUESTION;

Mr, Wallace.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G, WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES
MR, WALLACEs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The United States agrees that the plan at issue before
the Court is a valid plan, but there are many differences be”
tween our position and that of the Union.

We also agree that

the issue is a statutory issue reconciling the broadly-worded
prohibitions of Title VII

with the statute’s remedial purposes

.and its emphasis on voluntary compliance.

However, v?e believe

it would be a mistake to read the language of Title VII, which
was drafted in 1964, and the many thousands of pages of
legislative history as dealing with the question of voluntary
programs of this kind.
They were not in existnece.

They were, in a realistic

sense, the farthest thing from the minds of the draftsmen at
that time.

And while the case immediately concerns the issue

of voluntary compliance programs, the contentions that have
been made here before this Court cut much more deeply than that
into the remedial fabric and fact of enforcement of Title VII»

26

The Respondents and, I regret to say, the Petitioner
onion, are asking the Court in this case to repudiate the numerous
federal Court decisions over the years that have upheld the
propriety of the ordering of numerical race-conscious relief
to rectify the effects of an employer's proven discrimination.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, if we accept Mr. Gottesman's

position on behalf of his client, we don't need to decide
whether you are right or wong as to the extent of a Courts*
remedial power, do we?
MR. WALLACE s

It would be possible for the Court not

to reach that issue.

Court to reach it.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think that

his position can

Obviously, the results stand without it,

because we argue for the same result.

However, the premises

that he was stating orally to the Court are not easy to
reconcile with the first major decision of this Court under
Title VII, Griggs v, Duke Power Co, which rejects the notion
that its invidious and evil purpose is an element of the
prohibition.
It seems to me a revisionist view of all of the
holdings under Title VII.
QUESTION:

Well, that dealt with testing, dicin'’t

it, Griggs?
MR. WALLACE:

It dealt with testing, but it said

that even unintentional disparing

effects on racial groups can

be a violation of the Act despite the proved lack of evil
purpose or invidiousness or any of the other terms that were
just submitted to this Court as properly to be read into
Section 703(a) and 703(d).
QUESTION:

Let’s assume, and I thiijk Mr. Gottesman

accepted that this on its face is a gross violation of
Title VII.

Kis claim simply is that he has a complete defense,

that, on inspection, it turns out not to be a violation of
Title VII.

MR- WALLACE:

Well# we agree with the bottom line#

yes.
QUESTION:

I mean under Griggs# this, obviously,

under the literal language of the statute, if you will, is, on
its face, a gross violation of Title VII.

And his position is

that under this particular context, it turns out not to be a
violation of the statute at all.
And, if he’s correct, then what possible business is
it to the Courts in this case to reach the question of what would
an appropriate remedy be in the event of a violation of Title VII.
Certainly, what business is it of this Court to reach the
validity of the Executive Order?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it is difficult to decide the

case in isolation from other holdings interpreting Title VII
in a comprehensive way.
I think it’s quite true that, narrowly speaking,
the Court could avoid the question whether programs of this
type could be approved by consent decrees, as they have in
many cases, or whether they could be ordered as remedies in
litigated cases.

The question has been put to the Court many

times in petitions for certiorari arising from the eight
Courts of Appeals that approved such relief, and the Court has
nlways declined to hear the cases.
QUESTION:

In Griggs, Mr. Wallace, did not the Court

note that there was no question about any bad faith or bad

23

motivation of the employer?

But, on the contrary, the employer

had been conducting educational programs to bring its
minority employees up to high school equivalency?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

Nonetheless, the

employer violated the Act.
QUESTION:

The case turned on the impact, not on the

intention.
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

And the Respondent

here has submitted the same type of prima facie case about
impact on him through the use of a racial criterion, that
requires a response.

And it has been, in our view, rebutted

by the circumstances by which this program arose.
reason for which the program was adopted.

And the

But I find it very

difficult to reconcile with the interpretation of Title VII
that this Court has adopted with the legislative history of
the 1972 revisions to Title VII, and the consistent views of
the agencies that have administered Title VII, the idea that
this is not a prima facie showing of violation ofTitle VII,
because it was not done by invidious purpose.

And that the

broad prohibitions are to be read more narrowly and that somehow
by negative implication every employer is left free, which is
■;he reading of 703 (j) that the Court has been invited to make.
Every employer is left free to achieve balance with respect
to every element of his workforce by race or by sex.

And so

that anywhere where Blacks are over-represented or women are

30

over-represented or men are over-represented, he is free to
rectify that without any reasonable basis to think that he
could be liable to an action under Title VII or whether he might
be violating the Executive Order program.

That's what the

Court is being invited to say and it goes far toward undermining
both the Federal interpretation of the prohibitions and what
Congress was trying to do, and the effectiveness of any possible
enforcement.
The contention is what the Court referred to in
Albemarle Paper Co. as

the spur or catalyst that encourages

voluntary compliance is to be removed and the Court is to take
j.t on faith that the employers like Kaiser will continue to
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars even though there is
:rto possibility that a Court could order them to adopt similar
programs and that unions will continue to agree to such pro­
grams .
QUESTION:

Are you arguing that the collective

bargaining contract violates Title VII?
MR. WALLACE:
Title VII»

The contract is consistent with

That is our view.

What I am arguing is that the

interpretation that the union has asked this Court to make of
Title VII would undermine effective enforcement of Title VII,
Now, it’s possible, as Mr. Justice Stewart has
suggested, for the Court not to reach that* question.

But,

nonetheless, the interpretation that was just stated orally

31

is the one inconsistent with effective enforcement of the
prohibitions of Title VII.

What you are saying is in a case involving

MR. WALLACE:

Because, otherwise, the use of a racial

criterion presents a problem.

The tenor of the questioning is

that somehow we are not supporting the validity of the programs.

which we are supporting the validity of the program, the

one obligation that will expire when the local ivorkforce ratio

program was agreed to, less than 2 percent of the skilled craft
workers in this plant ware minority.

And this has been changed

page 167.
been

The result of the operation of the program, this has

increased

to 4.43 percent, in a situation where not only

the total workforce of 39 percent, but the figures that we have
been able to glean from extensive data show that even among
Etkilled

craft people in the area you would expect 15 or 20

percent minority.
And a similar program was adopted that changed the
representation in the plant as a whole, from some 10 percent
minority over a course of five years, 1969 to 1974, to 14.8
percent minority.
The program was one that was adopted in an atmosphere

34

where the employer was definitely *— had a reasonable basis
to think that he was subject to the making of a prima facie
case that he was guilty of employment discrimination.

And, as

a matter of fact, the Parsons Case brought against a neighboring
plant of Kaiser’s based on very similar statistics, the District
Court held that a prima facie case had been shown.
The actual selection of people under the program,
while it was 50-50 for the training program, at the same time
skilled craftsmen were being hired outside the training program,
22 were hired that year from the community at large and only

one was Black, 21 were white? 7 Blacks and 6 whites were taken
into training programs, so that altogether the entry into craft
jobs under the program in its first year of operation was, in a
sense, rather mild,

it was about 23 percent minority.

The program offered new opportunities for white
workers to enter the craft.

It did not in any way abbrogate

or establish seniority rights.

You don’t have the problem

under 703(h) as you had in the Teamster's case.

Mr, Fontham,
ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. FONTHAM
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BRIAN F. WEBER
MR, FONTHAMs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Michael Fontham, and I represent the
Respondents in this case, Brian Weber and the class of the
non-minority employees at the Kaiser plant in Gramercy,
Louisiana., who were eligible to bid for on-the-job training
programs.
The issue presented in this case is not the issue
stated at the beginning of the argument.

But, instead, it is

whether a company or labor union may institute a

50 percent

racial quota for entry in craft training programs that
discriminate

against non-minority employees and prefer

minority

employees, solely to achieve a certain statistical ratio, and
in the absence of any past discrimination by the company or

37
the Union against the preferred individuals and# in fact, in
the absence of any past discrimination at the plant in question.
In the course of my argument, I would like to, first
of all, address three factual areas which I think are of con­
cern and have not adequately been covered by fir. Wallace,
and I have an opportunity to do so, and some of the arguments
raised by my opponents.
First of all, with respect to the facts, I think it
is Important to note what the operation of the quota was
in this case because Kaiser' Aluminum had instituted training
programs in the past and the basis for entry into those
training programs, in addition to the skills required, were
the absence of physical handicap, with seniority.

And tnat

seniority criterion was a plant-wide seniority criterion
at this plant available to all individuals, whether they were
white or black or other minority —'whether they were male or
female.
Every person who was hired at the gate of the Kaiser
.■> 1st.■; j obtained his or her seniority status and was treated
ally with respect to that seniority system.

But, with

respect to the craft training programs — and I might add that
fchs Union had bean negotiating for its members to have these
training opportunities.
laborers at the plant.

The members of the Union were unskilled
And the opportunities presented by the

training programs were considered very important by these

persons —- an opportunity to advance, to learn u

I,

which skill can only be attained after years of training and
schooling.
And

so it was very important to these people who

felt they could obtain higher wages, better working conditiand, even more importantly, more security.

But, in addition

to the seniority criterion for entry into the training pro­
grams, Kaiser Aluminum imposed a 50-50 racial quota, wnich
said that for every non-minority individual who entered a
training program, they must take a minority individual.
QUESTION:

I don’t understand that there is challenge

to the idea that this is a.quota program.
MR. FONTHAi-5sYes# Your Honor*

certainly is a

quota program.
QUESTIONS
hero.

Then I have misread some of the briefs

Perhaps I'm confusing the Union’s brief here with some

of the Union’s amicus briefs.
MR. FOKTHTK:

Your Honor, I think the only difference

is that some of the parties choose to call the quota a
race conscious program. But the fact is that the means of
.•••/phying a race consciousness is a 50-50 numerical ratio,
which has the ecfect of actually segregating the seniority
. -, making an all white seniority line and an. all minority
r:-iority line end for entry into the training programs,
choosing, the top.person from each seniority line, which
also has the concomitant effect of advancing members of

39

minority groups over whites in the seniority line because
there ware more whites in the seniority line.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fontham, these briefs, both the parties'

and amicae are sprinkled with euphemisms, but we can't decide
this case on what something is called, but, rather, on what
it is.
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And I think—

And I don't think there is any — accord­

ing to the Chief Justice — real question or controversy here
as to what this program is and what it provides.
MR. FONTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

The point that I'm trying to make, Your Honor, is
that the effect of the application of the numerical ratio was
to—
QUESTION:

—discriminate against some white people.

MR. FONTHAM:

Not only to discriminate, Your Honor,

but, in addition, to take away their accrued seniority
rights—
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FONTHAM: —they had been given through years of
service to Kaiser.
QUESTION:

Yes, I don't think there is any question.

QUESTION:

How many years was Weber there?

MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Your Honor?

How many years was Weber there?

40

MR. FONTHAM:

Your Honor, Mr. Weber personally had

been an employee of the plant, I believe, since 1968 or ’69.
QUESTION:

That's that long line of seniority he's

talking about?
MR. FONTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor, the

seniority

system—
QUESTION:

It's very clear, in any event, Mr. Fontham.

that even if Mr. Weber had not been accepted in this program
because* there might have been white people with more seniority,,
or people with more seniority, the fact is that some people
were excluded from acceptance because they were white, and I
think that's—
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I think there's no controversy about that

in this case.
MR. FONTHAM:

That's correct.

Secondly, I would like to address the question of
the supposed or alleged prima facie case—
QUESTION:

Just a second, Mr. Fontham.

by saying you did not think the

You opened

issue was the one phrased at

the outset of argument.
MR. FONTHAM%
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don’t quite understand that.

You do

agree, don't you, that the only question here is whether this
program is prohibited by Title VII?

41
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

That's the only question here.

MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Absolutely? Your Honor.

Yes? Your Honor? that’s correct.

I didn't understand what you meant when

you said the issue was different.
MR. FONTHAM:

Well? Your Honor? I was simply saying

I would phrase it differently than the way Kaiser's attorney
phrased it.
Secondly? with respect to the question of alleged or
assumed or? I believe the word that was used in this case
is "arguable” past discrimination.

Because I think the

important fact with respect to the record is that two Courts
have already held that there is no past discrimination at
Kaiser.
QUESTION:

And what evidence wa3 there on the other

side?
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Your Honor? the Union—

MR. FONTHAM:

Commission.
QUESTION?
these two Courts.

What I'm talking about is the findings of
It wasn't based on testimony.

MR. FONTHAM;
testimony.

Yes, Your Honor, it was based on

It was based on an analysis of the testimony of

the Kaiser officials; statistics with respect to what the
work force was comprised of.
QUESTION;

Would you expect Kaiser to come in and say

they openly discriminated against Negroes?
MR. FONTHAM:

No, Your Honor, I don't expect them to

say that.
QUESTION;

What do you expect them to say then?

MR. FONTHAM;

What I'm trying to say, in the District

Court, Your Honor, the Union filed two briefs on the issue.
QUESTION;

Sir, my question was not "briefs”; it

was "evidence" — testimony ~ normal evidence.
MR. FONTHAM;

Your Honor, it's the same argument tnat

the Government raised in this case, the asserted statistical
disparity, which I would like to address.

So I do think,

Your Honor, that the fact or the question of Kaiser's past
employment practices was covered at the trial.

The evidence

established that Kaiser had had a plant-wide seniority system,

43

and that the seniority system granted seniority rights to
minority—
QUESTION;

To 2 percent of its employees.

MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Well# Your Honor, to all employees.

Two percent of its employees were Negroes.

MR. FONTHAM:

Right, Your Honor, taut just simply in

the crafts.
QUESTION:

Two percent in the crafts.

MR. FONTEAM:

Two percent of the skilled craftsmen

in the plant.
QUESTION:

That's what we're talking about.

MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

So they actually gave seniority to

2 percent.
MR. FONTHAM:

Well, Your Honor, the seniority

system was applicable with respect to the unskilled laborers
of the plant.

The craft positions at the plant are in a

separate category, and two percent of tho3e persons in the
crufts positions were members of the minority group.

But

the record establishes that Kaiser had taken a number of
affirmative action measures prior to the institution of this
racial ratio to try to obtain more minority craftsmen.

Kaiser

had a separate craft application file which was for Blacks
only.

And they went to that Black application file first

whenever an opening in the craft postions came up.

44
QUESTION;

And they couldn9t find but 2 percent?

MR. FONTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

Kaiser advertised

in predominantly minority newspapers in the area.

Kaiser

instituted the establishment of goals and timetables in con­
junction with the requirements of the Office of Federal
Contract Compliance.

And the fact is, and the evidence in

this case establishes, that persons who were trained craftsmen
with the requisite skills were not available in the area.
And there was a statistical realisation, if I can use that
term,

that the number of minority craftsmen in the Kaiser

plant was no smaller than available craftsmen in the work
force at large.

The simple fact is that for whatever reasons,

racial discrimination or other reasons, minority craftsmen
wer<i not available and Kaiser was not able to get them.
And, as a result of that — I believe Judge Wisdom's
opinion said that Kaiser made good faith efforts, laudable
efforts to try to seek and find minority craftsmen, but it
was unable to do so.

So the record reflects that there was no

peist discrimination.
As to a possible argument of discrimination based on
pure statistical data, and the fact they compared persons with
the requisite skills, they were different comparisons.

As for

the evidence in this case, Your Honor, we did put on the evidence
about Kaiser's employment practices in the past.

I think

if you had heard the Director of Equal Employment Opportunity

45

at Kaiser and his statements on the question of labor
*

relations in the United States, I think you would have found
that he was a very sincere, forthright and honest individual,
and spoke very convincingly,
QUESTIONS

Do you assume I didn't read it?

MR. FONTHAMs
I said "heard".

No, Your Honor, I don't assume that.

And I think that that does make a difference.

But I think the important thing that has to be remembered is that
this was not — the evidence is unambiguous with respect to
why this was done -- it was not done as an asserted remedy.
This was done because Kaiser felt the need under QFCC
requirements or whatever to voluntarily take action to change
the statistics.
The fact is that Kaiser knew very well why craftsmen
were unavailable and they were not under-utilized if the
comparison was persons with the skills.
the Government likes

But Kaiser knew that

a —■ if you have to compare 2 percent

to an overall general availability of minorities, which was
39 percent, Kaiser said, "We've got to change the ratio."
And what they did was they chose this 50-50 ratio
for selection as a means of achieving an overall 39 percent
representation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fontham, let's suppose that just on

the figures or on the statistics a plaintiff —• a Black
plaintiff -- could have made out a prima facie case that

46

would have required Kaiser to put on some evidence, that
wouldn't make any difference in your—
MR. FONTHAM:

It would not, Your Honor, but I think

I want to make a point as strongly as I can that we’re
not talking about even that situation.

The fact is vrhether

it would make a difference or not is not important because
Kaiser never undertook an analysis at the Gramercy plant.
QUESTIONS I know, but people disagree with you on
that. But, as I understand your position, it wouldn't make
any difference in this program,

if Kaiser sat down and when

they looked over the situation said that, in their opinion, a
prima facie case in discrimination could be made out, you
would still say that this response would be illegal under
Title VII?
MR.FONTHAMi

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I think that with respect to Your Honor’s statement,
Your Honor, the statement made by my opponents is rather
artfully worded in that it says, "Kaiser could have believed".
It doesn't say that Kaiser undertook an analysis and came
to that determination.
QUESTION?

No, I know it.

They freely deny — they

refuse to admit that a prima facie case, could have been made
out.
MR. FONTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor, and it couldn't

have, if you used the persons with the requisite skills in the

47

labor force.

The only way that you could have raade out a

prima facie case, in this instance, would have been to
compare the statistics for skilled craftsmen, which the
National Bureau of Apprenticeship says can take up to five
years of training and schooling, and which Kaiser spends
$15,000 to $20,000 per year per person in the training
programs, including on-the-job training and significant school­
ing.
If you took that statistic, the 2 percent, and
compared it to everyone in the labor force who is a member of
a minority group, you could have had a prima facie case? but
this Court has said you are not supposed to do that.
it said that.

X

believe

And it said that the applicable comparison in

trying to show a prima facie case is persons with the
requisite skills.

So you can compare lawyers in the law firm

with persons who have a law degree and are qualified to be
a lawyer’, or a doctor in a medical clinic with persons
who are qualified to practice medicine in making a determina­
tion whether the employer had discriminated.
But, in this case, what the Company and the Union
did was they set their goal, which is what they call it, as
the ultimate place to which they wanted to go.
QUESTION?
minute.

Mr. Font.ham, let me interrupt you just a

As my Brother Stewart has said, the case and the

briefs and the arguments are sprinkled with euphemisms.

You

48

have used the terra "remedy” once and your brothers and
sisters have used it/ and you now use the terra "goal".
What do you mean by "remedy" and what do you mean by "goal"?
MR. FONTHAM:

Okay* Your Honor, let me say, hopefully,

I said this was not a remedy.

I didn't use the term "remedy".

When I say "remedy", this is what I means

You have an

individual, like this Court has said on several occasions,
and you assertedly or allegedly, or you even admit that
you have done something to that individual and, therefore,
you remedy that by returning that individual to where he would
be.

You may pay him some money or you

may put him in his

rightful place in the seniority line or whatever.
I think that it is incorrect to say that — and I
think it is very unfortunate that the argument is being made
here that because a person is a member of the minority group
someone can assert or allege you are doing something against—
QUESTION:

When you use the word "remedy", you mean

you settle a claim that a particular individual had against
you for damage that you had done to him?
MR. FGNTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

But it doesn't

have to be in the legal technical sense, necessarily’.

I

just think that the word "remedy" has to be confined to the
individual as opposed to a class.
If somebody says that somebody in a class was dis­
criminated against, and we pick out people that everyone in

43
this case concedes were not discriminated against — even
the Government says they are not identified victims of past
discrimination.
QUESTION:

By Kaiser.

MR. FONTHAM:

By Kaiser, yes, Your Honor, that's

true.
QUESTION:

Who is this that agree they weren't

victims of anything?

Did they go to schools in Louisiana?

MR. FONTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is no doubt, and

I fully concede that societal discrimination has occurred—
QUESTION:

I thought so.

MR. FONTHAM:

—with respect to Blacks in this

country and, particularly, in Louisiana.
QUESTION:

I thought you did, but you sort of went

over the other way, didn't you?
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, I think—

I remember what you said before.

MR. FONTHAM:

We have in this case — what is

happening, and what we object to, is that the Company, the
Union and the Government have decided that the social goal —
and I think it's a laudable social goal — uplift minority
groups, but how they decided to do it—
QUESTION:

But don’t they also decide that in this

Bill?
MR. FONTHAM:

No, Your Honor.

Well, yes they did—*

Mr. Fonthara, you perhaps — do you have

in mind the hypothetical amendment to Title VII that I out­
lined to your friends in their oral arguments?
MR. FOMTHAM;
QUESTIDN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you agree that if Congress passed

rach an amendment or such a statute that an employer could
proceed to try to achieve racial balance by programs of this
kind?

MR. FCMTHAM:

I think, Your Honor, that the obvious

50

question would be State action, whether there was Federal
Government or State action that might create a constitutional
problem.
QUESTION?

What kind of State action?

Just passing

a statute — State action?
MR. FONTHAMs

Well, Your Honor, the question i3

would the Office of Federal Contract Compliance be enforcing
it.

But, if it's not, if Congress wants to return the situa­

tion to pra-1964, I think you're absolutely right, they could
do that, and employers and unions could try to achieve a
social goal which would erase discrimination.

I certainly

hope that Congress doesn’t decide to do that, but I think
Congress has definitely, as of now, decided that there should
be no race discrimination.
And what I was going to say previously is Vhat
Kaiser, the Union and the Government apparently decided to do
in this case, Your Honor, is to achieve a social goal.- which
is quite laudable, but, by the same token, Kaiser is not paying
the cost, nor .is the Union.

Instead, the entire cost of tnis

program is placed on the shoulders of the non-minority members
in the unskilled labor force at Kaiser.

have the same seniority rights.

They

They have the same opportunities

51

for advancement in the plant end, finally, the Company posts
bids, with one of the bids saying, for this opportunity,
it won't be seniority, but it says the sole criteria will
be that only a member of the minority group can apply.

And

with respect to other bids, they enforce seniority with the
bids.

At least half of the persons they select will be

members of minority groups.

The one means of advancement unde;:

the Company-Union agreement is seniority, after years of
service with the employer and the union, and it's the most —
I think even this Court has said, seniority is the most
fundamental kind of right for a person who works in a
labor force such as this — is taken away.

The accrued rights

of the non-minority employee are simply taken away and race
becomes the factor for determining who enters into the train­
ing programs, superimposed upon the seniority system.
And I believe that in view of this Court's decision
in the Teamsters Casa, or even in the case of finding of past
discrimination, the Court is saying only with respect to
individuals the Government must carry a burden of proof that
the individuals here, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the individuals had been discriminated against in the
past.
And in this case we have a pure out and out preference
being granted to members of minority groups.

We feel that

under the cases decided by this Court and under Title VII, this

52

is illegal.
Title VII says in Section 703(a) *— and I will
discuss the legislative history — in fact, maybe I should
do that first.
I think that the inferences drawn by the Union in
this case are very difficult to adopt.

I think that the

Union demonstrates very, very substantially that there was
nothing sporadic, and there was nothing infrequent about
the statements of the supporters of Title VII with respect
to the issue of quotas, with respect to the issue of pre­
ferences and of achieving racial balance.
The fact is that what happened when Title VII was
passed was the opponents got up and they were there making
claims which were regarded almost as outrageous by its
supporters.

And the claims were, well, this is for quotas

to advance minorities, and the proponents saying this will
permit attempts at achieving racial balance.

And Senator

Williams, Senator Clark and Senator Chase, the persons
who were really behind it, saying, well, Title V2I says no
discrimination against anyone, whether you be a member of
a minority group or a member of a non-minority group.

And

just from reading the legislative history of Title VII, X
think that this is the thing th^.t comes through the most
clearly — and all of them expressing the same thing ■—* the
opponents saying we can have ratioes, the supporters saying

53

this is a non-discrimination statute that has prospective
effect.

It will allow the breaking doiim of barriers.

Section 703(j) says you can't require quotas; they put
that in here becau.se the opponents were saying some
Government entities will require quotas.

That's what Kaiser

and the Union thought the Government was doing in this case.
And the supporters saying, "They can't do that.

It will

violate Title VII."
So what does the statute say that’s applicable to
this case?
It says that there can be no discrimination against
any individual with respect to their employment opportunities
on the ground of race, color, sex, national origin and the
other factors.
And Section 703(d), what does it say?

Because

it's very important with respect to the argument this is a
new program and a great opportunity for everybody.
Well, the fact is that Section 703(d) says that a
company or a union or a joint labor-management body may not
discriminate against any individual with respect to entering
*

into training programs or with respect to the terms and
conditions of training and opportunities provided under
training.
And I think, from my own standpoint at least, the
Court's decision in McDonald is related when considering the

54

construction of Title VII.
Circuit.

MeDona3.d came out of the Fifth

The Fifth Circuit had dismissed the case of a

white individual who allegedly had been stealing and assertedly some minority employees were not dismissed.

And the case

was kind of decided by the Fifth Circuit in a fussy manner
that left it open whether the whits individual had any cause
of action, number one, and, number two, whether the same
standards were applicable to the white individual, because
they might have construed the Fifth Circuit as having said there
is a cause of action, but your review is different because
of, possibly, the invidiousness or nastiness of the
discrimination.
So the case was brought up here.

And the Court

said that, first of all, a white individual does have a
cause of action under Title VII and frequently, and most
importantly, the same standards are applicable as if that
individual were a member of the minority group.

And if you

apply the same standards to this case, why are the Company
and the Union imposing

discriminatory quotas against

members of the non-minority groups to achieve what they
thought was a desirable ratio in the work force?
QUESTION;

I think that's not the Union's position,

but 1 think the Union's position would be that if there
were a conspicuous disparity in the work force and that
90 percent, or 95, 98 percent of the craft employees were

55

tJegroes and only 2 percent white, I think, as I understood
the Union's position, it x*/ould be that the employer and the
Union could cooperatively and voluntarily agree to put in this
kind of a program until a more representative work force were
in place.
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Did you understand it the same way?

MR. FONTHAMs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, I'm not sure I—

That's what I understood.

MR. FONTHAM%

To me there are differences between v/hat

the Union argued in oral argument and in the brief.
QUESTION;

There are differences between the Union's

position, the employer's position and the Government's position.
MR. FONTHAMs
QUESTION:

No doubt, Your Honor.

It's very clear.

MR. FONTHAMs

I think, however, that if the Union and

the Company did that that there's no doubt that if they
discriminated against Negroes or other members of the minority
groups it wouldn't last a minute in this Court or any other
Court — in a Federal Court.
QUESTION:

You know more than I do if you know that.

(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Mr. Fontham, what's your answer to the

Uni,on's argument that 703(j) , when it says that nothing contained
in this subchapter shall be interpreted to require any employer __

56

attaches special significance to the word "require" and,
by implication, permits it, although it does not require it?
MR. PONTHAMs

Yes, Your Honor, I think, in the first

place, that’s solely inference.

If Congress had wanted to say

it's permitted, they could have.
In the second place, you cannot possibly read that
provision in conformity with Section 703(a) and Section 703(d),
the requirements saying there has to be non-discrimination
against anyone.

Because as long as the attempt to achieve a

racial balance discriminates against one individual, than it
would be wrong under Title VII.
I think also that the Union's argument really refers
to the fact that the supporters of Title VII finally said
if the opponents in this say this and say this and say this,
we'll just put a

provision in the statute.

I don't know

exactly what term they used, but when Senator Humphrey
explained it, and explained what Senator Jackson wanted, he
said this does not change the substance of the statute.

We

are trying to answer the contention that this will be
required by the Government.
QUESTION?

You say,in effect, that the explicit

language of (a) and (d) prohibits the drawing of the implica­
tion that the Union draws from (j)?
MR. FONTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor. I think also the

57

decisions of this Court pretty much precluded drawing that
inference, because the decisions of this Court indicate that
you cannot discriminate against individuals.
QUESTION;

Title VII now applies to local governments,

I take it?
MR. FONTHAM;

Your Honor, it applies, Iknow, to State

and local governments, and I'm not sure about the extent to
which it applies to the Federal Government.
QUESTION;

Well, to State and local government—

MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

It does.

Suppose a school district had

decided to integrate its faculty or to have racial balance in
its faculty, they just voluntarily decided to have racial
balance in their schools and voluntarily to have racial balance
among their faculty—
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

—I take it yotsr position would be that that

would violate Title VII insofar as the faculty was concerned.
MR. FONTHAM;

Yes, Your Honor, because this Court has

said so in the Cork Case.

It is clear that the obligation

imposed by Title VII is to provide an equal opportunity for
each applicant, regardless of race, without regard to whether
members of the applicant's race are already proportionately
represented in the work force.
QUESTION;

The Union argues that there5s a tie between

58

Title IV and Title VII and that in the Title IV discussion, it
was perfectly clear that Congress

wasn't objecting to volun­

tary decisions of school boards to integrate their faculty this
way.
MR. FONTHAM:

Your Honor, I have to admit I did not

read all the legislative history of Title IV.

I don't think

the fact they were passing Title IV at the same time tney were
passing Title VII, however, would be a valid ground for this,
it seems to me, extremely tenuous inference throughout the
language that on its face acts like it's almost done, that
you can't require a racial ratio in the work force.
QUESTION:

You can't avoid discriminating — you can't

avoid discrimination by discriminating.
MR. FONTHAM:

That's—

Yes, Your Honor.

(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Thank3 very much.

MR. FONTHAM:

I think also, Your Honor, some of the

other decisions of this Court support our side of this case.
The decision of the Court in Griggs v. Duke Water indicates—
specifically stated — that preferences, and what we're talking
about here is a preference that discriminates

to integrate

minority or majority is exactly what is proscribed by Title VII.
The decision of this Court in City of Los Angeles v.
Manhart I think is very important because, in that case,
.although it wasn't a race discrimination case, the Court stated

59

that the emphasis in Title VII is with respect to the rights
of the individual.

And it is very clear that these rights

are personal rights.

And what we have in this case is the

asserted justifications being brought up on a class basis —
a minority class.

The claim is made because tney are members

of a class, and yet, at the same time, we have discrimination
against white workers

on whom it has the same kinds of

economic impact -- on frustration, on earning potential, loss
of an opportunity to advance, that 20, 30, 40 years ago it had
on the minority groups in this country.
And, for that reason, we think that decision is
important —• very important -- to this case.

The emphasis

should be on the individual.
In the Teamsters Case this Court made it very clear
that emphasis is on the individual; that we cannot have in
this country decisions that are made on the basis of race or
class as long as Title VII is operative.
When the Government came in in the Teamsters and —■
a little specificity here — the Courts will say they are all
members of the class and it's okay to grant them a remedy.
Court said prove that they were discriminated against in
the past on an individual basis.
And this is one thing that is present in this case,
(Considered by everyone, none of these persons had been dis­
criminated against in the past by Kaiser.

Instead, they had
I

equal rights with the non-minority members of the unskilled
labor force, equal rights to advance, their seniority status
was the same as everyone else's, except, in some cases, tney
had been working at the plant for less time.

But with what

Kaiser Aluminum did, persons who had worked at the plant for
more time couldn't reach their economic expectations.

They

had to step back because Kaiser understood that the Government
wanted to achieve a social goal, and Kaiser was going to help
the Government do it by placing those costs on its workers,
rather than bearing the cost themselves, or laying the costs
on the Union.

And that is another factor that is very

important in examining this business of voluntary compliance.
The one thing I think the Courts are not willing to
do is to allow employers and unions to be the arbiters of
what Title VII means.

Because one thing you can expect the

Company to do and the Union to do, just naturally, and
I'm not trying to say that this is don® wrong -- I mean with
the wrong intent, or whatever, but the fact is if they can
put the cost elsewhere they will.
what happened.

And in this case that’s

They put the cost elsewhere,

even if you

assume there was an arguable case, they put the cost on the
unskilled labor force, people who themselves had no training
skills, who themselves wanted in the trainixig program, who
themselves had been construction workers.
QUESTION:

If there was an arguable case, entering

61

into this program would not have prevented any of the
plaintiffs in that arguable case from suing Kaiser or the
Union, would it?
MR. FONTHAM:

I think that's correct, Your Honor.

I

think one thing the Courts would not do is say because there
was an asserted remedy, which, in fact, is a preference to one
member of the minority group, that another individual who was
actually discriminated against was barred from suing.
QUESTION;

So in that sense neither Kaiser nor the

Union, by entering into this agreement, immunised themselves
from suits for actual discrimination.
MR. FONTHAM;

That's correct, Your Honor.

What they

immunized themselves from was harrassment — in their view,
harrassment — by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance.
In other words, the Compliance Officer of the Federal
Contract Program, in preparing his utilization analysis,
would focus on the statistics, and, if the statistics are low,
then the possible things that can happen are the loss of
Federal contracts, reporting you to the Justice Department,
and publication of the Company's name in this manner, which
all the Company lawyers think is a denial of due process,
in the absence of a hearing on debarrment from future contract
opportunities.

And this is what they avoided.

This really had nothing to do with litigation at
Sraxnercy.

There may have bean some litigation at some other

62

plants.

But the main thing they were trying to do was get

in compliance with the OFCC.

They went even beyond what the

OFCC has ever required and actually instituted a program
that took away accrued seniority rights.
All that the Government has ever said it was for,
previous to today, is these goals and timetables.

And if you

look at the back of the Government’s brief in this case, they
even say quotas aren’t good.

And if you look at what the

OFCC said when they issued their guidelines, they said,
'"Ah, someone thought when we used numerical ratioes in our
preliminary guidelines that we meant quotas, but we really
didn’t."

So they changed it.

So I think that’s important

too.
Everyone says to me, "Well, is this the end of
affirmative action if Weber wins his case?”

The fact is

affirmative action has never gone so far as Kaiser and the
Union wanted to go in this case.

The Government has not said

that quotas are all right — certainly nothing of a fixed
or rigid nature, enforcing its affirmative action programs.
And in addition to that, taking away of accrued
rights has been stayed away from by the Courts, even in
instances of terrible refusal to comply with proposals to
break down barriers at the entry level.

Sometimes the

lower courts have said, "Well, if the State Police just won’t
comply, we’ll make them hire a certain percentage for awhile."

63

But they have stayed away from doing that with respect to
accrued rights.

And that’s even in a case where there is a

violation of Title VII.
In this case# they go beyond any type of affirmative
action method that has been used in the past or will be
used — a quota that takes away accrued seniority rights and#
in the absence of any past discrimination.
And I think if the Court rules in favor of my side of
the case# it doesn’t change anything in terns of affirmative
action — actually or substantively.
On the other hand, if the Court says the Company and
the Union or the Federal Government can require quotas#
50-50 ratio quotas# and# as in this case# that quota can
discriminate against whites and take away their accrued
rights# and the sole purpose of the quota is to achieve
statistical parity — and# in this case# if Your Honora will
review the record# you will find that even after they achieve
39 percent representation in the work force# they will use
that quota to meet minority minimum3 in the work force at
large indefinitely — in perpetuity# the exact statistical
percentage of the minority group representation in the
population at large.
QUESTION:

We don’t have that in this case though#

do we?
MR. FONTHAM:

Yes# Your Honor# we certainly do

64

QUESTION;

Well, we don’t have to decide that in

this case.
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION;

You’re projecting into the future.

MR. FONTHAMs
the future.

Well, X think, Your Honor—

Yes, Your Honor, it is projecting into

But I think what I want to say is that if the

Court were to say that that's all right, I think there are
agencies in place to enforce that decision, and that it may
very well be that a lot of people have not wanted to overtly
say that in the past because of what Title VII says that it's
possible, and very likely, in fact, and especially in view of
the proposed EOCC guidelines that were later changed, that the
Government will requix:e every contractor in the nation to
achieve this kind of statistical parity, to have the
perfect proportionate representation in the work force at
large on a basically national scale.
QUESTION;

Well, that would depend, the validity

of that would depend upon the meaning of subsection (j),
wouldn't it?
MR. FONTHAM;

Well, Your Honor, I think the meaning of

subsection (j)-~
QUESTION;

Isn’t that correct?

Wouldn't that question,

whether the validity of that would depend, would it not,
upon what is prohibited by subsection (j)?
MR. FONTHAM:

Well, I think subsection (j) would

65

indicate—
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but that would be the question,

wouldn't it, what does subsection (j) mean?

We don't have

the meaning of that prohibition here because Government has
not—
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

—sought to enforce that; isn't that

correct?
MR. FONTHAM:

I think in this case what you have is

what the Government requires — that the employer will give
a self-analysis.
QUESTION:

The Government doesn't actually explain—
But this was a voluntary action between

the employer and the union.
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, I agree, Your Honor.

So, therefore, there has been no directive

or prohibition or requirement by any agency of Government in
that case; isn't that correct?
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And subsection (j) only has to do with

what may not be required by Government; isn't that correct?
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

And this case doesn't stem from anything

that was required by Government, correct?
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Well, the—

It was voluntary.

66

MR. FONTHAM:

It was ci voluntarily enacted program;

that is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Fontham—
r

MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

In order to be correct on McDonald, page 281,

footnote 8, this Court said, "Santa Fe disclaims that the
actions challenged here were any part of an affirmative action
program.

See brief for Respondents, Santa Fe 19, Note 5.

And we emphasise that we do not consider here the permissibility
of such a program."

Clearly we said we weren't passing on an

affirmative action program.
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I recognize that.

Okay.

MR. FONTHAM: But, Your Honor, I think what the Court
also said was thaV.Title VII protects all individuals,
whether they be members of a minority group or non-members of
a minority group, and that those persons have a right to sue and
to have rulings and to have non-discrimination on the individual
basis under Title VII.
QUESTION:

But we were not passing on an affirmative

action program.
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:
in there?

Well, Your Honor, I think that certainly— v

Why do you think the Court put the footnote

67

MR. FONTHAM :
QUESTION :

Your Honor—

Why do you think the Court put that footnote

in there?
MR. FONTHAM:
QUESTION:

I think—

You think?

MR. FONTHAM:

I think that the Court — I don't know

what I think.
(Laughter)
MR. FONTHAM:

In closing, I think the main point I

want to make is that individuals have been discriminated
against in this case.

They have lost their employment status.

They have lost their seniority rights.

The goals or desires

of the Government or the Union or the Company may have been
laudable or objectives that may raise some socially desirable
point, but the fact is they can't try to accomplish that by
discriminating against non-minority employees.
The statements of Title VII, which prohibit any
discrimination against individuals, the legislative history
of Title VII, where the statements are repeated and repeated
and repeated and repeated that it would not permit preferencesj
that discrimination against non-minority group members is
prohibited, indicate, and the decisions of this Court saying
that white individuals8 cases are to be tried under the same
standards as cases brought by members of minority groups,
all say that the class of employees in this case -- Brian

68

Weber and the other individuals who lost their seniority
status — who did not have the opportunity to enter the
training programs, have been subjected to a violation of
Title VII.

And there was no past discrimination in this case

that could justify that in any way.
There was no discrimination against the individuals
who are being preferred and, in fact, there was no discrimina­
tion in the plant at large.

The seniority system was available

on a plant-wide basis to everyone — everyone had an equal
opportunity to advance; and minority members will advance
through that seniority system and in some way minority group
members will be fairly represented in the craft positions at
*

that plant.

It may not ba as soon as soma would desire, but

you consider those plants cannut reach that point via
discrimination against non-minority members.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fontham, three or four times you

mentioned Senator Humphrey in your references to the
legislative history.

l8m going to ask you an unfair question:

Itfhich side of the case do you think he'd be on?
MR. FONTHAM:

Your Honor, I'm not sure.

I think that

there's a good chance that he'd be ore my side.
QUESTION:

You can't say for sure though?

MR. FONTHAM:

(No oral response.)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
anything further?

Mr. Powers, do you hav©

You have about three minutes left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT Oi? NOYES THOMPSON LOWERS
ON BEHALF OF KAISER. ALUMINUM & CHEMICAL CORPORATION
MR, POWERSs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'll be

very brief.
First let me say that this is not an unheard of form
of affirmative action.

In the two largest consent decrees
■*
•

3

which have been entered in this country, the AT & T consent
decree and the* steel industry's consent decree, this very form
of action was proposed, was adopted by the lower courts and
confirmed by the Court of Appeals.
Secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, I6d like to emphasize
*

that we do not believe that a Congressional amendment is
required to approve the type of action that was taken hare.
We think that nothing could be clearer than that Congress
intended that this type of voluntary action -be taken, cons is ten
with the broad remedial purposes of the statute.
There has been the suggestion that counsel have en­
gaged in euphemisms.

Let me stress that we3re not suggesting

that this matter should be solved in terras of a label that3s
placed on it.

And 1 would suggest that the action that the

Company and the Union have taken here is entirely consistent
with the words of this Court in. Albemarle Paper v. Moody,
when it suggested that it wanted to provide the spur or
catalyst that causes employers and unions to self“examine and
to self-evaluate their practices and to

endeavor to

70

eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestige of an un­
fortunate and ignominious page of the country’s history.

We

believe that what the Company and the Union have done in this
case meets that standard.
We would suggest that far from debasing or taking away
from Brian Weber and other white employees who lack craft
experience at the Gramercy plant and in other Xaiser plants,
what the Company and the Union did here enhanced their
seniority.

It gave them an opportunity along with Black

employees and other minority employees and female employees to
become craft-qualified.

It set up that program in the best

way the Company and the Union could find to both respond t© the
value and virtues of seniority and yet to make a demonstration
that the old barriers for minorities and women had ended, and
that the new opportunities promised by Title VII were, in fact,
real.
We believe that this is a coromendable example of what
can be achieved through collective bargaining.
here asking for commendation.

But we’re not

We ask only that our right to

continue this program be upheld.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
