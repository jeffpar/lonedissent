MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next In Pfeiffer Company v, Diversion Ford and others.
Mr0 Vickery, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. Da VICKERY, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR0 VICKERY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
These two eases combined for purposes of this hear­
ing bring to the Court for resolution that question which it
did not have to reach in a decision in 197? in what has commonly been come to be known among the bar as the Caput© case.
In the Caputo case, the Court held that an amphibious
worker who was subject to being assigned to work both on the
dock and- on the navigable waters of the United States was a
type of worker that Congress Intended to cover in order to
provide a uniform compensation system for him in the 1972
amendments to the Aet„
Caputo was such an amphibious worker, being subject
fj jfi.

to assignment either on the dock or on a vessel on the navigable
waters during the course of his employment on the date of his
accident.
The petitioners respectfully submit that It is this
navigable water standard on which the Court turned in its

is
Caput© opinion.

It is founded on the historical decisions of

this Court9 stemming bask to the famous ease of Southern
Pacific V* Jensen.

Counsel in this case have drawn the line

of demarcation between their two positions very clearly.
Simply speaking, in extending the Act®s jurisdic­
tion ashore in 1972, did Congress intend to provide a uniform
compensation system for amphibious workers who were covered
prior to 1972 for only a part of their work activity, that
part which was done on navigable watersa

As we respectfully

submit9 that is all that Congress intended.

Or did Congress

intend9 as the federal respondent asserts, to cover all waterfront workers who work ©n piers, wharves, terminals and other
areas adjoining navigable waters®
Before this Court in Caputo, the federal respondent
contended that it reached only those waterfront workers who
were directly involved In the loading or unloading of land
transportation.

That was their position in reply to ©ilr

petition for certiorari in this case®

In their reply brief

here, they have expanded this to include all waterfront workers
who may be Injured on piers, wharves, or other terminal areas
that meet the situs' test of the 1972 amendments.
QUESTION?

Mr. Vickery, this ease doesnst involve

any controversy about situs, does it, but only about status?
MR, VICKERY:

Situs is net at issue.

Bryant, the

cotton hitter, was injured In a warehouse and a vessel was

5
moared outside at the pier- along side this warehouse,, and
Diverson Ford was injured on railroad tracks that ran out on
the pier in the Port of Beaumont Navigation District, so situs
is not an issue.
QUESTION:

And doss exist, I mean --

ME. VICKERY:

It does exist in this ease, there is

no question about it®
QUESTION:

And the controversy is over the question

of status®
MR. VICKERY:

The question of status.

Situs exists

only to the extent that the federal respondent now contends
that situs only is enough to also satisfy the status test,
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR6 VICKERY:
volved.

But other than that, situs is not in­

Oddly enough, we are not too far apart insofar as

the factual situations existing in these three eases either.
There is not much of a dispute as far as that is concerned,
but there are very distinct differences in the types of em­
ployment that these men were engaged in.
First of all, this Court recognised that Caputo was
a regular longshoremen or a longshoremen by occupation®

That

is, he spent a substantial part of his working time in the
actual loading or unloading of vessels,

Neither Ford nor

Bryant spent any substantial period of time in loading or
unloading vessels®

In fact, Bryant had not engaged in the

6
loading or unloading of cargo from a vessel for approximately
five or six years prior to the date of his accident®

Ford

had participated in the loading and unloading of vessels in
the Port ©f Beaumont on only seven days during the year im­
mediately prior to his injury.
by occupation.

Ford was not a longshoremen

He would be more aptly described as a laborer.

He worked approximately seven days as a longshoreman during
the year prior to his Injury. He worked approximately 35 ©r
36 days as a warehouseman doing the type of work he was doing
heres loading or unloading land transportation®

The rest of

the time,we don®t have specific dates, but during the rest
of the time he also did construction work in the Beaumont
area and he also drove a beer truck for a beer distributor.
So there is no way to classify either of the two men involved
in this case as being longshoremen or as having engaged in
loading or unloading vessels prior to their injury of enough
significance .to make them. longshoremen by occupation.
In fact, Ayers Steamship Company, for whom Bryant
works, has no stevedoring operations at all. . It never loads
or unloads a vessel.

It is a steamship agent who assembles

cargo for the vessels that it represents in the warehouses.
• .i

It uses warehouse workers like Bryant to unload the land
transportation, to stow the cargo in the warehouse t© await
the arrival ©f the vessel.
QUESTION:

Do they strip containers?

?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTIONS

They are not subject to that type of work?

MR, VICKERYs
QUESTIONS

No, sir.

No, sir.

So they are specifieally not subject to

that assignment.
MR. VICKERY:

The union contract provides that that

is d@ep«=sea longshore work.

Ayers has never stuffed ©r

stripped a container.
QUESTION:

In your brief, Mr. Vickery, you urge the

Court not to place too much or any emphasis in its test in
determining status on whether ©r not the claimant is a long­
shoreman, at least as I read your brief.
MR. VICKERYs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Although the statute does make that one

of the tests, doesn't it?
MR. VICKERY:

Well, I think the statute requires him

to be both a longshoreman and at the time of his injury to be
engaged in maritime employment, for example.
QUESTION:

So than being a longshoreman is part of

the test or one of the tests, isn't It?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Yes, but if he —

It is under the statutes whether we like

it or not.
MR. VICKERY:

But let me give you an illustration of

why I think you have t© consider something other than

8
longshoreman as an occupation.

If Caputo had been moonlight­

ing on the date of his accident and had been driving the
truck,, he would not have been subject to being assigned to
work on the navigable waters of the United States®
QUESTION:

Well, what if the —

MR. VICKERY:

He would have been a longshoreman by

occupation.
QUESTION:

What if the collective bargaining agree­

ment with the Teamsters local and that trucking company had
said in this case we are going to call every truokdriver a
longshoreman and that Is your job, longshoreman, just because
some day you might want to get the advantage of th^is under
4lf®fehe statute.

MR. VICKERY:

In my submission, the test is the tra­

has given it.
QUESTION:

I understand that, but it says -- the

9
statute says including any longshoremans so what does that
mean?
MR. VICKERY:

A longshoreman is a man who loads and

unloads vessels«

thing else like a laborer or a messenger or something else?

work either on the dock or on tha vessel and he becomes —

10
QUESTION:

WeXls that is covered by other person

engaged in longshoring operations.
MR® VICKERY;
QUESTION:

Yes5 sir®

My question goes to what your understand­

ing 1b of the statutory meaning of longshoreman.

That wasn’t

clear to me from reading your brief.
MR, VICKERY:

The statutory meaning of longshoreman

is a person who engages in the loading ©r the unloading of a
vessel.
QUESTION:

Then why isn’t it chronological in view

of the other statutory law, a person engaged in longshoring
operations?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Why did they have to have that?

Why is it wholly meaningless if that is

all it means?
MR. VICKERY:

Well* there are other people who engage

in longshoring operations besides longshoremen.
QUESTION:

But you said that is the definition of

longshoreman®
MR. VICKERY:

All right®

But what Congress was try­

ing t© say9 Mr® Justice Stewart9 is reflected by what it said
with respect to checkers®

Checkers are directly Involved in

the loading or unloading of the vessel^ are subject to being
assigned to work either on a vessel or on the doeks and
Congress was specifically referring to that®

It needed these

11
other persons involved in longshorlng operations to identify
people like the checkers, to also identify shore-side crane
operators who are not longshoremen, but they are leased by
the terminal facilities, the terminal owners, leased cranes
to be used in the loading and discharging of the vessels with
an operator.

They are not longshoremen by occupation or they

are not longshoremen working regularly in the loading or
unloading of vessels.
1 think that Is in referring to it as an occupation,
I think you are dealing with a man who spends substantially
all of his working time working as a longshoreman in the
loading ©r the unloading of vessels8
QUESTION:

And on the day of his accident9 what if

he was a longshoreman up until yesterday?
MR. VICKERY:

That Is why you need the maritime

employment —
QUESTION:

I know, but that is separate statutory

language.
MR, VIOIRRYs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It Is our -duty t© try to give meaning te

©very word of the statute If we can»
MR. VICKERY s

And what I am trying to say t© you is

that because h© is a longshoreman today9 h© has to be engaged
In maritime employment tomorrow, just like h@ does today when
he is working as a longshoreman.

The fact that he may be a

12
longshoreman by occupation as I am an attorney by occupations,
but if I drive a taxicab tomorrow that wouldn’t give me any
benefits as an attorney,

If he is driving a taxicab down to

the dock tomorrow to pick up people in his moonlight job9
even though he is a longshoreman by occupation,, he is not
engaged in maritime employments and even though he is injured
on an adjoining area he would not be covered simply because
he is a longshoreman by occupation when he is engaged in that
particular occupation.
I submit that that is the Importance and it is the
reason that 1 don’t think you can look at the terminology
longshoreman In the statute in isolation,
i,!.

•]

The Powell ease from the Ninth Circuit is another
good example of the situation if you consider the problems
that will arises

if'you consider the longshoreman by occupa­

tion' as being the sole test.

In Powell* this man had been

a longshoreman for a good many years until about seven months
prior to his accident.

He then quit working as a longshore-

man and started working for the grain elevator unloading
railroad cars with grain into the grain elevator.

As such an

employee* he could never be involved in the work of the long­
shoreman which was done by independent contracting stevedores
In the loading and th© unloading of the vessel/,
QUESTION:

And what did the Ninth Circuit say?

MR. VICKERYs

The Ninth Circuit held that h© was no

13
longer a longshoreman9 that he had converted his job and he
was now strictly an unloader of rail ears at the grain
©levator.
QUESTION:

So he wasn’t covered by the statute?

MR. VICKERY:

So he was not covered by the statute.

And the problem of looking at longshoremen by occupations
Ford poses the question is he a longshoreman by occupation
because he works seven days, if not seven days* whats how
many months, how many weeks to make him a longshoreman by
occupation* t© make him automatically covered

regardless of

what job he is doing.
QUESTION:

Well* whatever the word means* you think

he has to be that at the time that h© is injured or killed —
MR® VICKERY:
QUESTION:

— to be covered by the statute?

MR® VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir,

If you are going to use just the «—

Maybe he had never been a longshoreman.

Maybe he had been a lawyer until this morning.
MR® VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Right®

He was hired as a longshoreman®

If he is

killed today* then he is a longshoreman®
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

And is covered by the statute.

MR® VICKERY:
QUESTION:

He is a longshoreman.

Yes* eir®

Suppose a longshoreman wheeled something

off a ship and wheeled It right to a truck that was going to
carry It away and he was helped by Mr. Ford and the truck
driver to load the truck and all three got hurt.

I suppose

the truck driver wouldn’t be covered because he isn’t engaged
In maritime employment ©r what?
MR. VICKERY:

The legislative history makes it clear

that h© is not covered.
QUESTION?

It is because why?

MRe VICKERY:

Because he is not engaged in maritime

employment«
QUESTION:

He is not engaged in longshoring opera-

tions?
MR. VICKERY:

He is not engaged in longshoring

operations.
QUESTION:

Well» this piece ©f cargo came straight

off the ship and is being loaded right on the truck.
r

MR. VICKERY?

All right, then what you have there„

what you have to look at there Is the congressional intent to
cover or to provide a uniform compensation system» you’ve got
to look at the maritime employment test®
QUESTION;
i :,

So you say that the driver ~

MR. VICKERY:

All need to meet the maritime employ~

merit test®
QUESTION:

The truck driver just doesn’t engage in

maritime employment» e© that excludes him you say.

15
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Right,

Now how about in this same accident at the

same moment the longshoreman would clearly be covered?
MR® VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Because he is unloading the ship.

MR, VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

Yes, sir,

And he is a longshoreman®

Now, how about

Mr. Ford there, he is engaged in — he always does this, he
is on the pier, h© is attached to — maybe he is hired by the
stevedoring company, but he isn’t a longshoreman.

Right then

he hasn’t been unloading a ship, he hasn’t been on the ship,
but would he be covered in that example?
MR0 VICKERY:

I do not think he would be covered

because he would not meet the maritime employment status test.
The maritime employment tost is whether or not a person is
subject to being assigned to work ©n board a vessel and on the
dock®

■’
QUESTION:

I know, but here comes a piece ©f cargo

off the vessel, it never stops. It gets right to the truck,
he helps the longshoreman put it on the truck and he is hurt®
' «V’,

MR® VICKERY:

He is engaged In longshoring opera­

tions at that time, I would have to say that he is engaged:' in
■longshoring operations at that time®.

But it is not enough

unless he also meets the maritime employment test, and the
maritime employment test that this Court has enunciated since

16
Southern Pacific v. Jensen is only that work which is done on
navigable waters.

That is where the dividing line between

maritime employment and non-maritime employment has been drawn
by this Court repeatedly.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Vickery, it is not your conten­

tion that the Injured employee has to be engaged in work on
navigable inters at the time of his injury t© be covered?
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

No9 sir.

Is it?

MR. VICKERY:

No, sir»

That is what Congress said.

Congress said that we want to cover this man who prior to the
1972 amendments was covered- only for the work that he did on
the ship.
QUESTION:

Right»

MR. VICKERY:

Prior to the 1972 amendments^ 'men who

were engaged in maritime employment9 as this Court, had
repeatedly defined it, were subject to having their compensa­
tion remedy —

MR» VICKERY:

There is no situs

problem*involved

\

But in determining

17
maritime employment where the person is working is determina­
tive of that issue»

That is what started the whole thing in

1917 when Southern Pacific v. Jensen held maritime employment
is on the vessel only and the state compact can’t apply.
Nordenholt they reaffirmed that»

In

They said handling cargo on

the dock is not maritime employment in 1922»

In 1927 Congress

sought to solve the problem by passing the Longshoremen’s Act
and it put in a maritime employment requirement.
This Court considered a question of what is mari­
time employment under the Longshoremen3s Act in 1930, in
Nogueira, and they expressly held maritime employment was
work performed on the navigable waters of the United States.
That was reaffirmed in Pennsylvania Railway v. O’Rourke
Company in 1953.

It was the basis of the holding of this

Court in 1971, in the Erie-Laekawanria case, and again in
Cooper Stevedoring v. Fritzkofsky»
QUESTION:

But the.O’Rourke case and some of the

other cases were purely situs cases, weren’t they?

O'Rourke,

as I remember, was a brakeman on the Pennsylvania Railroad»
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

That was his job.

MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That’s right.

But he was injured on navigable waters

and therefore it was held that the FELA was not applicable.
MR» VICKERY:

That’s right, because —

18
QUESTIONS

Ancl it was a eistus case0

MR. VICKERY:

That * s right, because he was working

on navigable waters, is what made him engaged In maritime

Even though he was a railroad brake-

That is what made the railroad —
QUESTION;

So it wasn’t a status ease, it was a

situs case.
MR, VICKERY:

Well* the only person who had to have

any status prior to the 1972 amendments was the employer, and
the employer had to meet the maritime employment test by
showing that it had employees who worked on navigable waters.
O’Rourke himself would have satisfied that but the Court held
that the railroad had other employees who worked on navigable
waterss therefore the railroad was —
QUESTION:

Was an employer within the meaning of

the then statute,
MR. VICKERY:

All right, and that required maritime

employment.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. VICKERY:

And that is what I am saying, that

is where the Court got the definition of maritime employment,
from the employer definition.

Congress used precisely the

same words in the 1972 amendment and now requires that both

19
the employer and the employee meet the maritime employment
status test,
QUESTION:

Right.

The O’Rourke case was the one

I haven’t read it for a long time — Justice Reed wrote it
and it was a five-to»four case, was it?
MR» VICKERY:

Was It five-to-four?

I’m sorry, I

don’t recall who wrote it*
QUESTION:

I think Mr, Justice Reed wrote the

opinion.
MR. VICKERY:

But it was a five-to-four decision,,

that’s correct,,
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal., if there are no further questions.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr* Vickery»

Mr. Bryson»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BRYSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The question in this case is the extent to which
the Longshoremen’s Act as amended in 1972 applies to employees
engaged in handling cargo on the waterfront.

Now, the posi­

tion of the Department of Labor is that the Act applies to all
waterfront employees who are engaged in the process of
transferring cargo between land and water transportation»

20

Now, the petitioners have characterised the depart­
ment’s position as-being somewhat broader than that.
not.

It is

The position is that with respect to cargo handlings It

Is necessary that the employee be engaged in the process of
moving cargo between land and sea transportation.
Now* the Board and the Director have reached this
position as a matter of construing the statutory term longshoring operations.
QUESTION:

Would that definition of yours include

Mr. Justice White8s truck driver in this case?
MR. BRYSON:

No, it would not, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

and the reason would be —
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

Tell me how he would be excluded.
Well, essentially the reason Is that

that truck driver would not be engaged In maritime employ­
ment»

That truck driver would be engaged in employment —
/

most of his employment would be looking towards the land he
would be engaged in most of his conduct, most of his daily
conduct in moving cargo between the maritime marine terminal
and points Inland of that and his job basically would not be
a maritime job.
QUESTION:

Well, you said most of his efforts.

I

guess we can all agree to that, but In Mr. Justice White’s
illustration he was doing something more than that.
MR. BRYSON:

Exactly, but as this Court pointed out

21
in the Ca,puto ease, the whole thrust of the Act is to look
to the nature of the employment, not the particular act that
the employee is engaged in at the time,
QUESTION:

As I remember the Caputo case, the

opinion expressly excluded the truck driver,
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Exactly,
My question, of course, is whether your

proposed test doesn't include him?
MR. BRYSON:

No, I think not, and the reason being

that we focus on the marine terminal worker because this is a
person who spends all of his time, who as a matter of pro­
fession, as a matter of occupation is someone who is constantly
dealing with cargo that has immediately been unloaded from a
vessel or is about to be loaded onto a vessel.

He Is like

the harbor worker, like the shipbuilder, like the ship
preparer, a person who is there on the marine situs, on the
maritime situs, is dealing day in and day out with cargo that
is Immediately to be loaded or immediately unloaded from a
vessel.

The truck driver comes in once a week or whatever

and moves on to land occupation,,

His occupation is not that

that could fairly be termed as maritime employment»

Mr, Bryson, what do you think the phrase

maritime employment means?
MR. BRYSON;

MR. BRYSON:

Now, navigable waters has been rede­

fined, of course, in the ’72 Act to include ~
QUESTION:

But employment hasn't been defined at

all, has it?
MR. BRYSON:

No, maritime employment has not been

defined.
QUESTION:

So wouldn't it be the natural thing to

look and see what that term means in the decisions of the
Court?

MR. BRYSON:

But the problem, Mr. Justice Stewart,

23
with trying to define maritime employment the way It was
used, although I think not defined in the old cases, the way
It was used to the extent that It was used to suggest that
maritime employment was limited to employment which actually
occurred over water, is that that would not take care of a
lot of the different kinds of maritime employment that are
involved in the 197? amendments.

For instance, ship builders

are
QUESTION:

They are because they are specifically

covered by the statute.
MR. BRYSON:

That’s right, but the statute says

maritime employment and then proceeds to include a number of
groups within that concept of maritime employment, and the
legislative history on that point is quite clear, that it
means the entire group of specific occupations to be within
the notion of maritime employment.
If I can read from the section-by-section analysis
in the Senate report, it says the amendment amends section 23
of the Act to define an employee as any person engaged in
maritime employment, and then it goes on to say the defini­
tion specifically includes any longshoremen or other person
engaged in longshoring operations and any harbor worker.
Including a ship repairman, ship builder and ship breaker.
Now, Congress knew and it was clear in 1972 that
there were a number of different types of, say, just to take

an example, ship builders who never set foot on the water,
who would never

which is so integrally related to maritime navigation and
commerce that Congress thought to bring them within the
definition of maritime employment.

Now, they did not define

the term, of course, and that is so much trouble has ensued
in trying to define the statute.
QUESTION:

What is a ship breaker?

MR. BRYSON:

A ship breaker I believe is someone

who is either in the conversion, a form of ship repair, a
form of converting ships from one form to another»

But the

point is that there are a number of these individuals who
never set foot on land, including —
QUESTION:

You mean set foot on navigable waters»

MR. BRYSON:

Excuse me — on navigable waters as

it used to be defined»
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

One can’t st

foot on navigable waters.

Of course, they spend all their time

on navigable waters as it is now defined because it has been
defined to Include all of these maritime situs areas such as
a dock, a pier, a wharf, a building way and so forth.
Now, the Director and the Board have looked at —
QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, are those two separate

25
entities or one entity for purposes of appellate review, the
Director and the Board?
MR. BRYSON:

For the purpose — well, they are

clearly two different entities.

The Director is the delegee

of the Secretary of Labor who is charged with administering
the Act and appears as a party seeking to in this case sup­
port the Board’s order»
QUESTION:

Now, perhaps I didn’t -—

Where is the Director authorized to be a

party in these proceedings?

As I read section 921(c), appli­

cation can be had to the Court of Appeals to set aside an
award of the Benefits Review Board and copies are to be
served on the Board and other parties»

I can certainly see

why the Board would be a party, but why is the Director a
party?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, the Director is designated to

defend the Board’s orders and I do not know —
QUESTION:
MR» BRYSON:

By whom?

provision which provides —

MR. BRYSON:

There have been some cases in which

Labor Relations Act»
QUESTION:
MR» BRYSON:

You feel it is immaterial though?
Here because what happened here, al­

though there is some dispute as to whether the Director has
the power to seek review of a Board order which Is contrary
to the Director’s position, in this case it was the
Director’s position and the private party’s position that
was sustained in the Court of Appeals and sustained in the
■ Board, so that the Director's standing is
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

There is no internal inconsistency?
That's right, no, not here.

There

have been cases in which there is Internal inconsistency, but
not ;here.

In fact, the Board and the Director from the be­

ginning have taken the same position with respect to the
definition of the terms longshoring operation and maritime
employment,

by defining those terms to include the entire

operation in the marine terminal with respect to cargo
handling, and —
QUESTION:

Doesn’t that go very far toward, as I

think was suggested in a question a few moments ago by my

27
Brother Blackmuns doesn’t that go very far toward eliminating
the status requirement in the statute?
MR? BRYSON:
QUESTION:

It doesn’t —
Assuming the employer is a covered em­

ployer because he has other employees who are —
MR0 BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Exactly.
And then doesn’t that go awfully far

toward eliminating the status requirement as to the employee,
the claimant?
MR0 BRYSON:
certainly does.

With respect to cargo handlers3 it

In our view, cargo handlers are engaged in

longshoring operations and therefore you don’t have to go
any farther to determine that that is maritime employments so
there is no further status inquiry that has to be made.

As a truck driver he would be covered?

Well, he would be covered because he

would be engaged in the overall process of moving the cargo

MR. BRYSON:

That is unloading* but how about loading?
Well* in the case of loading, the

reverse would apply, he would not be covered if he were

the edge of the terminal physically but actually put it down
within thirty feet Inside the terminal —

That is remlnescent of the discredit

point of rest test, isn't it?
MR. BRYSON:

I think not.

The point of rest test,

of course, distinguished within the terminal between where
the cargo came off the vessel and was placed down and so
forth -— here we are talking about the edge of the terminal

MR» BRYSON:
QUESTION:

I understand.
You are asking us to draw a good hard

fast line and have you got that line firmly in mind, that is
what I am trying to find out.
MR. BRYSON:

The problem is that this situation

doesn’t appear very often in the industry.

It is a difficult

line to draw, of course, with respect to this statute which
has very general statutory language about what constitutes
longshoring operations.

But the general pattern in the in­

dustry is for the spur to go into the marine terminal and

36
you have people who are employed by the marine terminal to
transfer cargo from the vessel or from the place inside the
marine terminal to the spur that's located right there.
Now, of course -—

But then are you saying that his entire

employment must be on the situs?
MR. BRYSON:

No.

It may be that he is basically

employed on the situs, If he is employed by an employer,
that he spends a lot of his time on the situs, but he is
basically a terminal worker, but he may occasionally go off
the terminal and deliver something.

The fact that he goes off

QUESTION:

I have seen some of these terminals, I

guess we all have, and I haven’t seen one yet that has a
sign that says this is six inches past.

In a real port you

don’t know where a terminal ends, isn’t that true?

Some of

them have fences and some of them don’t.
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Well, in these cases —
If you don’t have a fence, how do you

know where’s the end of It?
MR. BRYSON:

The terminal is generally defined by

the relationship of the land transportation and the sea
transmittal cargo between the sea and the land transportation
device, either railroad or truck.

Now, in the Caputo case

itself, there was some question as to where ---

call it, do you know exactly when

Is there a sign that says, "This is the

Of course there's not.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, in many cases, for instance as

in the Port of Beaumont there is a sign that says, "This is
the Port of Beaumont."
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

But the sign is up in the air.
That's true, that’s true.

It may

create some difficulty In determining exactly what the limits
of the terminal are, but there aren't very many cases that
we've had —■
QUESTION:

On that point, Mr. Bryson, in the Caputo

case, reading from page 253 of the opinion, the container
Blundo was checking had been taken off a vessel at another
pier facility outside of Brooklyn and brought overland un­
opened by an independent trucking company to the 21st Street
piei’.

The question that raises In my minds.

the truck

driver that hauled that container from one pier to another
covered?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, that truck driver I believe,

although I’m not sure that the record reflects that, I be­
lieve that truck driver was not employed by employer.
QUESTION:

Well, again, assuming he was employed by

38
an employer —
MR. BRYSON:

Well, if you were employed by the

terminal operator, let’s say, I would think he would be
covered because he’d be moving between one facility of the
terminal and another.
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

Different terminals»
Well, that may be, and he would still

be, because the cargo had not been unloaded at that point, he
would still be —
QUESTION:

All I am suggesting to you is that moving

from one maritime terminal to another really isn't very dif­
ferent from moving from one maritime terminal to a railroad
station five miles away, and I'm sure that happens fairly
often,
MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think the usual pattern is for

the railroad spur to be coming up to the terminal, and if It
is the employee of the terminal operator that is doing the
moving, he would be engaged in longshoring operations»
QUESTION:

Now —

I take it then the gangplank now just

extends to the edge of the terminal?
MR. BRYSON:
of putting it.
that's accurate.

That's right.

I think that's one way

It isn't the way I would put it, but I think
And the definition of navigable waters is

the way Congress did just that.

They said the Jensen Line

will be moved from the gangplank to the edge of the marine

39
terminals "and they used the word "terminal'7 in redefining

navigable waters.
Now, the petitioners have proposed a test under which
the coverage under the act would depend on whether the em­
ployee was subject at any point during the day that he was
injured to being assigned on board a vesselo

Now, there are

a number of problems with this test, and the first and most
fundamental problem is that it fails to take account of the
basic purpose of the 1972 Act, which was to move the Jensen
Line inward, to move it away from the gangplank —QUESTION:

Don't you think it’s very important to

distinguish between the test of situs and the test of status?
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:
MRo BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Certainly, except that before 1972 —
It is important not to confuse them.
Exactly.
Because they’re confusing enough as it

is, it’s a confusing enough statute as it is*
MR. BRYSON:

It certainly is,

The problem, though,

with petitioner’s test is that I think it reinstates situs, a
situs test, into the status definition by virtue of going
back to the situs question of maritime employment which de­
pended on its being, as petitioners read it, over the

one,

and 3aying that that’s necessary to get the status, that you
have to have, be subject to being assigned on to a maritime
situs in order to have a maritime employment status, and I

think that’s exactly the problem with petitioner’s test.
QUESTION:

Would you say that you can have maritime

employment without ever being subject to assignment in —
MR. BRYSON:

Exactly, yes, as in the case of the

shipbuilder, for instance, or, to take an example, there are
many Instances in which somebody, maybe a dock worker, who Is
not subject to assignment on the ship but he is engaged in­
tegrally in the loading and unloading process — for instance,
to take Mr. Blundo, the checker in the Caputo case, although
as a matter of fact, as the court wrote in describing the facts
Mr. Blundo was subject to going on a ship in certain eases0
He could very well not have been.
QUESTION:

Well, the result might have been dif­

ferent if he had not been, as far as you can tell from that
opinion.
MRo BRYSON:

The court did not, in discussing Mr.

Blundo’s status and why he had a status that was a maritime
status, they did not, the court did not refer to the fact
that he was subject to assignment»
QUESTION:
MR0 BRYSON:
QUESTION:

But it is in the opinion as a matter of —
It’s in the facts, that’s true.
The outer limit, then, of the employment

test is maritime employment?
MRo BRYSON:
QUESTION:

That’s right; that’s right.
Someone who is not engaged in maritime

41
employment could not qualify?
MR. BRYSON:

That’s right.

And maritime employment

includes each of the various named categories and others,
miscellaneous categories that may appear.

But in that it

covers each of those named categories, it covers such people
as ship builders, who in many instances, as I say, may not
be subject to being assigned on a vessel»

And it also covers

the dock worker who may be involved in an integral part of
the unloading process»

For instance, suppose I’m a dock

worker and standing right on the dock and taking cargo direct­
ly from the ship, I simply happen not to be subject to assign­
ment to the ship to work on board a ship.

I would clearly be

engaged in long shoring operations even though I was not sub­
ject to being assigned on the ship»
Now, I would be covered under the new act, I would
have maritime status because I was engaged in longshoring
operational I would have maritime situs because I would be
working over navigable waters, but I would not be included in
petitioner’s test because I would be not subject to assignment
on a vessel.
QUESTION:

But your test would also cover the worker

who took cargo out of a warehouse on the dock that had been
stored there for five or six days?
MR„ BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Well, that’s true.
That’s this case, with respect to —

MR. BRYSON:

That’s this ease3 that's right.

In our

view and in the view that the board and the director have
takens you can't distinguish between the case in which the
cargo moves steadily from the ship to land transportation and
the case in which the cargo is taken out of the ship, laid
down at the point of rest* and then allowed to sit there for
a day or so, and. then picked up then and moved on to land
transportation.

In that case, the board has determined that

there just is no way to determine how long it has to sit there
whether if it sits there and is picked up by somebody who
works in a different crew, that person should not be covered„
Now, the court rejected that point of rest test in
Caputo and the same considerations suggest rejecting the
petitioner’s test in this case, which would depend on this
business of assignment on a vessel on the day of injury.
Suppose for instance the vessel was not in port on
the particular day of injury.

It’s not clear that petitioner'

test —
QUESTION:

This isn’t really the petitioner's test,

it's more accurately what the petitioner says the statutory
test is.
MR0 BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Well, that's right,
And if suppose the vessel weren’t there

on the date of injury, under what I understand the petitioner
thinks the statute means, you tell us the statute means, then

^3
he wouldn’t be covered.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, that's right, but x^e suggest that

that would not make good sense in applying ~
QUESTION:

Maybe not; maybe nothing in the statute

makes very good sense, but our duty is to decide what the
statute means»
MR. BRYSON:

Well, that’s certainly true, and our

suggestion is that particularly in light of the doctrine that
this statute should be given an expansive construction in
favor of the injured claimant, that a narrow construction of
the statute which would exclude claimants who were injured on
the dock moving cargo clearly engaged in iongshoring opera­
tions, for instance suppose unloading a container, the fact
that they were injured on a day that the ship was not in port
should not determine their coverage»
QUESTION:
tion?

Mr» Bryson, could I ask one other ques­

No one argues this, but is it conceivable that the

status test should be answered by some kind of a consideration
of the character of the work the man is doing?

Could one, for

example, say that truck driving is not typical Iongshoring
work and a truck driver would never be covered?
MR0 BRYSON:

Well, that's right»

I think, I would

hesitate to say that because it may well be that the terminal
will be large enough that you will actually be driving a
dolly or some mechanised vehicle *— a forklift Is a kind of

truck, I suppose.

You may itfell be moving a truck or you may

well be using a very large forklift that looks a lot like a
truck.

Typically we would say, of course, that would be long-

shoring operations, but —

QUESTION:

before, you assumed the truck driver would be performing a
kind of work that would normally be covered if it was at the
right place in the chain of movement of goods?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, if you have a — certainly a

truck driver could be employed in a marine terminal to move
cargo from the vessel, the side of the vessel, all the way to
the railroad spur, and he would be covered even though
typically —

the truck himself; all he did was sit behind the wheel and

Forklift drivers often

do just that.
QUESTION:

X understand forklift, but that's a little

more like what typical longshoremen, we’re talking about the
driver of a, you know, teamster — it's clear, everybody agrees
he's covered if it’s done in the right place and at the right QUESTION:

I would certainly suggest that he would

be covered; yes.
QUESTION:

Well, the petitioner certainly wouldn't

agree with you.
MR. BRYSON:

Oh, no, because I would say that he's

not subject to going on a vessel.

Now, of course, if he were

instance —

captain sign the bill of lading or whatever it might be?
MR, BRYSON:
QUESTION:
MR» BRYSON:

Exactly.
Then he'd be covered.
That's my understanding of petitioner's

test, because that would be an assignment onto the ship in the
course of his employment.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS—REBUTTAL

Please look at the last two sentences of the legislative
history.

They absolutely and categorically confirm this

Court's —
QUESTION:

In your brief —

QUESTION:

Footnote 36 on page 13.

MR. VICKERY:

They absolutely confirm this Court’s

definition of maritime employment as being used in connec­
tion with the 1972 amendments.

They state categorically that

an employer who does not have any employees who work on
navigable waters is not engaged in maritime employment.
There are many companies around the country that do
nothing but warehouse work and they don’t have a single eraV

ployee who ever goes on thenavigable waters of the United
States0

They do exactly the same type of work that Ford was

doing, exactly the same type of work that Bryant was doing,
but they have not a single employee who does any work on
navigable waters.
Congress states categorically that they are not

47
covered employers under those circumstances0
If those people working on the dock who have no
other employees employed by their employer cannot be in­
volved in maritime employment either.

This is a bootstrap

operation —

Because it’s well settled in the lav;

that a dock is the extension of the land, whether there is
water underneath the dock or land underneath the dock, Mr®
Justice Marshall., I don’t think makes any difference®
QUESTION:

I just wanted to know.

MR® VICKERY:

I see.

I believe that in Ford’s case there was no water
under the area Involved,

In Bryant's case, most of the piers

and warehouses in Galveston are over water.

I am sorry; I

misunderstood you, I misunderstood your question®
Now, the second thing that I need to say to the
Court, and I respectfully request that you carefully consider

H8
Is whether as Federal respondent contends. Congress intended
to move the Jensen Line out to the edge of the terminal, or
whether Congress simply intended to provide a uniform compen­
sation system for those workers who prior to the 1972 amend­
ment had to cross the Jensen Line.
did.

And that’s all Congress

It says the Intent is to provide a uniform system to

apply to employees who would otherwise be covered by this Act
or part of their activity.

The Jensen Line is what split

the workmen’s compensation remedy.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Vickery, looking at the defini­

tion of the term "employee” in Section 23 —
MR, VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

It says as you indicate that It means

first of all that any person engaged in maritime employment
including — and then it says "including a ship repairman,
a ship builder and a ship breaker" — is it your contention
that for a ship repairman or a ship builder or a ship breaker*
to be covered by this act he must be subject on the day of his
injury or death to assignment on work on navigable waters?
MR. VICKERY:

I believe that that same maritime

employment —
QUESTION:

That can be answered yes or no.

MR, VICKERY:

Yes, sir,

I think the same maritime

employment requirement exists there.
QUESTION:

So if he is a ship builder, full time.

49
life-long career ship builders, but he's a ship builder build­
ing a ship before it ever is on navigable waterss then he's
not covered at all and never was and never can be by this
act; is that it?
MR. VICKERY:
Congress says,

Your Honors I believe that's what

I believe that’s what they say»

I believe

the only possibility of there being a variation In this —
and I've had no ship builder eases, and I'm sorry I’m unin­
formed —
QUESTION:

No, no, the statute does —

MR0' VICKERY:

— on it, but the Secretary of Labor

had defined all of these terms that are used in the act in
connection with the safety and health regulations for longshoring and ship repairs, ship breakers and ship builders.
Those were published In I960, and the Secretary of Labor’s
definition of longshoring operations in connection with the
safety and health program which he has operated since I960 Is
so different from the proposed longshoring operations test
that the Federal respondent submits to this Court that it’s
ludicrous.
QUESTION:

My question doesn't have anything

to do with longshoring operations.

This is a different part

of the definition,
MR. VICKERY:
QUESTION:

Right, I understand.

An employee, it means any person engaged

50
In maritime employment including a ship builder.

Now* there's

no claim that he’s a longshoreman or anything like it.

But

let’s assume that he is and always has been during his occupational life a ship builders, but that his work is in building
ships before they’re ever on navigable waters.
Your argument has to be that he’s not covered at all
by this statute.
MR, VICKERY:

That is correct.

That is not maritime

employment within the meaning of the act,
QUESTION:

And you do concede that there are ship

builders all of whose occupational time is spent not on
navigable waters?
MR. VICKERY:

I believe the estimate given in the

Senate hearings at about 65 or 70 per cent of the work in the
shipyard was on navigable waters, and those workers were in­
volved
QUESTION:

And therefore there are 30, 35 per cent

that are not.
MR. VICKERY:

It would be about 35 that would not.

So a ship builder who builds entirely on land, who builds a
vessel —
QUESTION:

And is not subject on the day of his in­

jury or death to assignment to navigable waters occupationally
Is not covered by this,
MR. VICKERY:

He is not engaged in maritime

51
employment.

There are ship builders. Your Honor, who build

tugs, barges and things like that entirely on land, take them
by trailer and launch them.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. VICKERY:

In my opinion those people are not

engaged in —
QUESTION:

Some of them in World War II were built

in Iowa, as I remember.
MR, VICKERY:

Yes, sir.

Yes, they can be built

entirely on land.
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:58 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
