MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-201, Greenholtz and others against Inmates of the
Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex and others.
Mr. Gillian,, you may proceed when

you5re ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH II. GILLAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GILLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

this Court:
This case involves a question of whether procedural
due process applies in the granting of parole.

And if so,

the extant of the required procedures.
As this Court is aware, the circuits have been
pretty evenly divided on this, some of them saying that no
procedural due process applies at all, and others saying that
it applies to the extent that reasons must be given for the
denial of parole.
As a matter of fact, the Fourth Circuit, in Franklin
v. Shields, required more extensive procedures.

And the court

sitting en banc, it reversed the panel and said that the only
procedures it required were the giving of the reasons for the
denial.
However, in this case, the court of appeals mandated
very extensive procedures requiring that each inmate be given
a formal hearing at the time that ha first became eligible:

4
that he be given notice of the factors that were to be
considered and so forth.

I won’t list all of them.

The most important one, I think the one that we9 re
most concerned with, is the last.

The court of appeals said

that an inmate denied parole must be given a full and fair
explanation in writing of the essential facts relied on and the
reasons for denial.
Mow, we have no objections to the giving of the
reasons for denial, because under state law he is now required
to be given the reasons for denial.
But when the Board is required to give him a full
and fair explanation in writing of the essential facts relied
upon, we think that they ar© changing the entire type of
hearing and make it an evidentiary hearing, and that it would
be very difficult for us to comply with that.
So the issues —
QUESTION:

One way to comply might be to abolish

parole.
MR. GILLAM s
QUESTION;

I beg your pardon?
One way to comply might be to abolish

parole.
MR. GILLAN%

Vary true, Your Honor.

And I think

there may well be a very strong inclination for various states
to do that if some of these procedures are required.
Now — so our question here is whether it applies £.t

5

all, and whether Nebraska has complied with any procedures
which are required by the federal constitution.
We believe that there are two basic reasons why
procedural due process should not apply to the granting of
parole, and 1 will discuss the weaker of those two arguments
first.
First we believe that there is a difference between
the deprivation of a right which has already been granted, and
a freedom which has been granted, and the refusal to grant that
freedom in the first place.
Now, the Fifth Circuit has relied pretty exclusively
on that distinction in Scarpa v, U.S. Parole Board, and in
Morr1ssoy v. Brewer? this Court quoted with approval the
?
language in Bay v. Board of Parole, drawing that distinction,
holding that there was a difference between refusing to give
someone a benefit, and taking away a benefit which had already
been given.
I am not contending that that distinction
be decisive in this case.

should

Because I can visualise a situation

in which a state statute provided that on proof of a certain set
of facts that a person should be entitled to a certain benefit?
or conversely, that he should be entitled to a certain benefit
in the absence of the proof of certain facts.
1 do think, however, that the eases' indications are
that the showings should be much clearer in the case of a

6
granting of a benefit, and that the procedures that would be
required would probably be less in that situation*
The primary reason that I believes that the -- that
procedural due process should not apply in this case is that
under state law there are no provable facts which require the
granting of parole, and there are no facts which must be
proved to deny it.
The statute that Nebraska operates under is cited in
our brief, and first of all, it makes denial of parole
dependent upon the parole board53 having an opinion.

There is

nothing in here that says that if it should be found that
certain facts are true, that he shall be granted parole,
or that he may be denied a parole in the event, certain facts
are established.
It provides whenever the board of parole considers
the release of a committed offender, it shall order his release
unless it is of the opinion that his release shall be deferred.
And then look at the factors — or the conditions
under which they can deny it.

There is a substantial risk that

he will not conform to the conditions of parole.
What facts would one prove that would show that there
is a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions
of his parole?
QUESTION:

I suppose they might show that he had

been paroled three times previously and had always broken his

7
conditions of parole»

That would be —

MR. GILLANs
Honor.

It would be purely predictive, Your

And then the next is even less susceptible to proof.

His release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or
promote disrespect for

law.

Mow
QUESTIONj

Mr. Gillan, this case itself didn’t come

up through the Supreme Court of Nebraska, did it?
MR. GILLAN:
QUESTION j

Mo, Your Honor, it did not.
Has the Supreme Court of Nebraska ever

interpreted this language?
MR. GILLAN 2
QUESTION:

Never.
The government, as you know, the United

States, American, as amicus hare, construes the Nebraska
statutory provisions as being quite different from the main
run of statutory provisions governing parole in most states.
You

do I understand that you disagree with that

construction of your position?
MR. GILLANs

I am startled at the position that the

Solicitor General has taken in this case, because I have read
the federal act, and I find it virtually indistinguishable
from the Nebraska act inthis respect, because the federal aet
also says that the inmate shall be paroled unless the parole
board finds — and I believe one of the criteria is that his
release would depreciate the seriousness ©f his crime or

8
promote disrespect for law.
1 think that the federal act is very similar to the
Nebraska act.
QUESTION:

Well* do you think the Solicitor General

has misconstrued your act
MR. GILLAN:

or misconstrued the federal act?

Well, I think he has attempted to make

a distinction between the two —
QUESTIONs

Yes, he has, because they are quite

different.
MR. GILLAN:

I think that he has misconstrued our

act .
QUESTION:

You don51 believe your act confers an

entitlement to release in the absence of specific findings?
MR. GILLAN%
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I do not, because —
Because that’s the way he construes it,

as I understand his brief.
MR. GILLAN:

Yes.

The act says

he — it shall order his release.

our act says that

!

And they apparently take

the position that that confers some sort of an entitlement.
But the distinction that I draw is that it does not
order his release conditional upon the finding of any
defcerinabl© facts ©r any provable facts? that no one is
capable —
QUESTIONs
subjective opinions?

That instead of fact findings, these are

9

MR. GILLAN;
QUESTION;

Exactly.
Sometimes hunches; is that not so?
They certainly could be hunches»

MR. GILLAN;

And

very often it may be based on nothing more than the parole
board’s appraisal of the man as he stands before them.

They

may reach a conclusion as to his character from simply
listening to him and watching him.

And of course, obviously,,

they will have looked at his record to see what previous
Crimea he has committed and how many convictions he has had.
And at what he has don© in the penitentiary.
QUESTION;

His behavior record there.

MR. GILLAN;
QUESTIONs

Yes.

And —

And they may also come to the conclusion

that all people like him are bound to commit crimes?
Well, no, Your Honor, I don't think —

MR. GILLANs
QUESTION;

Say he doesn’t look you in the face.

MR. GILLAM;
science.

Well, certainly, it's not an exact

And I think nobody can with any great confidence look

at anyone and reach a conclusion that he will or will not
commit further crimes.
But neverthelass —
QUESTION;
MR. GILLAN;
QUESTION;

Well, where do you get the hunch from?
Well, I think that the —
You got it from me, didn't you?

That was my term

10
MR. GILLANs

Yes, I think the word came from the

Chief Justice.
While no one is god, no one can predict with any
certainty that this man will or will not commit further
crimes, the parole board is charged with the duty of making
those predictions, and they do it on whatever basis they have,
arid they’re frequently wrong.
QUESTION:

When I put the question to you, proposition

to you, counsel, I was using hunch in the sense that Judge
Hutchison of the Fifth Circuit used that once in a rather
notable article.
In that sens®, do you think that a parole officer
and the parole board could terminate parole on the basis of a
hunch that this -fellow was likely to get into trouble?
MR,, GILLAN t
QUESTION:

Definitely not, of course.
And that's a distinction you made, that

when it comes to granting parole, they have a vastly wider
range.

\
\
\

MR. G1LLAN:

You made it clear in Morrissey va Brewer

that a man who is on parole has an expectation, founded on
state law, that his parole will not foe terminated in the
absence of misconduct.
And — so unless they have evidence of specific
misconduct, they cannot terminate his parole.
QUESTION;

Mr. Giilan, suppose the state statute

11
provided that
hunch.

parole board

go «Id

act on the basis of a.

Say th© language was very, very broad and said that

because these things are largely discretionary they can act
on the basis ofi their personal escperience with respect to
certain kinds of people®

And if they just think that there's

some risk that the man femay not fo@ behaving properly, they
have a statutory right to do it.
Would that statute be unconstitutional?
MR„ GILLAN:

I don't believe that it would be, and I

haven't considered that.
However

»

QUESTION;

Well, if it®s not, then there really is

no fundamental distinction between granting and denying.
If you rely on
make any difference?

does the language of the statute

I know the government places -- argues

heavily on that basis.
MR, GILLAN;

Well,

of course, according to the

government8s position, as I understand it, the statute could
provide no standards whatever.
The government seams to take the position that this
could be in the complete discretion of thaparole board with
no standards whatsoever, in which case I suppose they could,
under the statute at least, do it on whatever basis they
wished, on a whim or a hunch or anything that they saw fit.
Nebraska has seen fit to lay down some standards for

12
the parole hoard to guide thorn in the ex@rsi.se of their
discretion.
And •—
QDESTIONs
on one detail?

Mr. Gillan, would you straighten me out

Is an inmate in Nebraska permitted to inspect

the file prior to a parole review hearing?
MR. GILLAN:
QUESTION 2

No, Your Honor*, he is not.
So that if there is something incorrect or

adverse in that, file, he doesn’t have a whack at it?
MR. GILLAN:
I frequently

No? that’s right, he does not.
I believe his file is discussed with

him, if there is something in there which the parole board
feels is important on® way or the other in the granting or
denial of the parole.

That matter is discussed with him.

But there’s no guarantee, of course, that that will
be true.

And he has no access to it.
We submit that a. fair determination of facts decisive

of rights is the basic purpose of procedural due process,

The

reason for having a hearing is to determine facts.
And. unless there are some facts which are capable
of being determined which are decisive of rights, we see no
purpose

in having a due process hearing.
QUESTION?

Well, does that mean really that there are

three different positions taken her©, that the state takas the
position that there is neither a liberty nor a property

13

interest involved.,

The government says ~ the federal

government says there's a property interest because ©f the
statute.

And your opponents say there is a liberty interest

because of the freedom which would result from the granting
of parol©.
MR, CSXLLANs

X say that there is no liberty interest ,

because the liberty interest has been taken away from him by
his conviction and sentence.
And that liberty interest can be revived only in the
ovent that a state statute makes provision for its being
revived,
Now, in the situation where he is granted parol®,
then the state by its action, pursuant to statute, has
recreated the liberty interest, and has provided that it cannot
be taken away from him in the absence of misconduct.
But until that liberty interest is recreated, it does
not exist,

Xt*s ~ X believe that this matter has to ba

considered pretty much in property rigifc terms — property
interest terms, which must be created by a state statute,
in this situation.
And unless we find an interest created by state
statute in parole, then it doesn't exist, because he has no
viable liberty interest,
QUESTION?

Mr. Gillan, dosanet the Nebraska statute

first provide that after a certain period ©f time, the inmate

14
is eligible for parole»
MR. GILLANs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir»
Doesn't it secondly provide that one who

has reached -that point in time shall be released on parole
tinless there are certain adversa findings made?
MR* GILLAN:
QUESTINi
those

Yes, Your Honor,

And than doesn't the decision of whether

adverse conditions exist or not determine whether or not

he will be in jail?
MR. GILLAN:
QUESTION:

It does, Your Honor.
And you

But —

say that's not a liberty

interest, whether or not he's in jail?
MR. GILLAN:

Well, it is not dependent upon facts.

There are no facta —
QUESTION:

— maybe a liberty interest, but it's not

a deprivation of liberty because he's already in jail.
MR. GILLAN

%

That's correct.

And there's nothing —

now if we look at a due process hearing as an attempt to
discover facts decisive of rights, there are no facts —
QUESTIONS

May I interrupt with just another quick —

supposing the statute provided a ten year term? the man
was in jail.
At the expiration of the ten-year term, they decided
to keep him in jail.

Would he fee deprived of his liberties?

He's already in jail

15
MR* GILLANs
QUESTION:

The sentence is for ten years»
Right»

But he’s already in jail.

Is

he being deprived of his liberty if he just stays there?
MR. GILLAN %

Well, he is not in jail then pursuant

to a sentence.
QUESTION;;

But the question is whether the deprivation

is a deprivation of liberty when he8s kept in jail longeir than
the law provides.
MR, GILLANs

Well, the sentence of ten years was

imposed by the court pursuant to law.

After the expiration of

that ten years,, he is no longer being detained pursuant to that
sentence.

He is simply bsdng detained by the unlawful -QUESTION:

Yes, because —>
Well, than why not if, at the end of his

parols eligibility period, and there9® a law that says he*a
entitled to get out unless certain conditions are present,
why isn’t he then deprived of his liberty if they keep him
in contrary to those provisions of law?
What's the difference?
MR. GILLAN 5
QUESTION:
of liberty.

Because
In terms of whether there’s a deprivation

What’s the difference?

16

MR, GILLAN:

Welly I — if this were dependent on a

factual determination, then I would say that if the facts
were true that conditionally give him his liberty, then
perhaps he would be deprived of a liberty interest.
QUESTION;

On Justice Stevens' hypothesis, is that

a guarantee of liberty, as the constitution guarantees your
liberty and my liberty right now?
MR, GXLLAN:

No, it’s certainly not any guarantee-

©f any liberty.
QUESTION;

It's an option for possible release, is it,

not?
MR, GXLLAN:

Yes, that's right. Your Honor, conditioned

•QUESTION:

Would yon mind reading that statute

again, to see if there's an option in there?

Isn't there the

word “shall" in the res?
MR. GILEAN;
QUESTION:
MR. GXLLANs
QUESTIONs
MR. GXLLANs

That's correct.
Is that an option?
Well, but it is conditional.
Tell m© your idea of an option.
Unless -- it can be when it's conditioned.

Whenever the board of parole considers the release of a
committed offender who is eligible for release on parol©, it
shall ordder his release unless it is ©f the ©pinion that his
release should be deferred because there is substantial risk

17
ha will not conform t© the conditions of parole? B, his
release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or
projects disrespect for law? his release would have a
substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline?
or D, his continued correctional treatment, medical care,
or vocational or other training in the facility will
substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding
life whan released at a later date,
QUESTION::

That’s really not much different from

saying ~ your point is it drains all the force, normal
force, out of the word "shall."
MR, GXLLANs
QUESTION s

Yes.
It sas though it said the parole board

shall order his release unless it decides if would be a bad
idea,
MR, GILLANs

Correct,

As I cite in my brief, there are two states, as I
believe it is, Kansas and Iowa, which have substantially
identical statutes, not as elaborate as this.

But in one of

them they say, shall, and in the other one they say, may,
or shall have the power to.
And it would be preposterous, I think, to say that
there is a difference.

Because in the one ease, it would be

saying that the state parol© board could reach a conclusion
that he should be released, and that there was no reason why

18
he shouldn't be released? and the statutory criteria had been

®fe,
ted yet because it says they shall have the power to
do sog that they could'keep him in the penitentiary simply
because it didn't say shall.

Now, that5® just a general subjective feeling of the
members ©f the board of parole, that this man has been
convicted of a very serious crime, and to release him now
would depreciate the seriousness of the crime.
Now, if they have got to present evidence to show
that, I don’t know how they would do it.

We had a man who was

convicted of robbery and in the process of the robbery he

The allowable maximum was 50.

That was

And the greatest minimum he

could be given would b© one-third of 50, so he couldn't have
been given more than about 16 years as a minimum.
i
And at the end of 16 years he would be eligible for
parole.
QUESTION:

But so much ©f this depends on the

original sentence in which there’s never been thought to be
any requirement of any fact finding, or any entitlement on

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Alsup, I know that

you say in your amicus brief that we acknowledge — the
government acknowledges — the requirement of a statement of
reasons have become an accepted part of due process safe­
guards .
Now, if a sentencing judge is pressed to grant
probation, suppose ha lots defense counsel argue that, as they
often do, and then he proceeds to sentence the man to 10 to
30 years, tor 3 to 9 years.
Must the sentencing judge give reasons for it?

QUESTION:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

Well, then that statement is & little

25
bit sweeping, isn’t it, that yon havein your brief at page

MR. ALSUP:

Wall j, the ~

QUESTIONj A little bit broad.
MR. ALSU?s

Mr. Chief Justice, the decisions of tha

Court since the Roth ease , at least in many instances including
the Morrissey ease, have required a statement of reasons as
part of the bundle of rights that the Court has prescribed
for a given circumstance.
And our reference in the brief was an acknowledgement
of the fact that on occasions the Court has required a
statement of reasons.
QUESTION?

You say in these circumstances.

Do you regard the circumstances the same in
Morrissey and here?
MR. ALSUP;

No, Your Honor, they’re different

circuestances.
QUESTION^
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION:

Quite different, aren’t they?
Yes, Your Honor.
You think Morrissey turned on the presence

of a liberty interest or the presence of a property interest?
MR. ALSUP:

Morrissey turned upon an entitledment

to liberty that was created by the implicit promise, as the
Chief -Justice recognised in the opinion for the Court, that
that conditional liberty would not be revoked unless certain

26
specified conditions were met.
QUESTION %

So you feel that the parole provisions of

Nebraska here are different from the Morrissey-type provisions
that you were just describing as referred t© in the Chief
Justice's opinion?
Because I take it the government position

her® is ,

it's a property interest that®s —
MR. ALSUP;

Well, the government recognises that

the entitlement-fco-property cases are analogous to the
©nfcitlement-to-liberty cases.
In feet, that very analogy was used by the Court in
Wolff v. McDonnell,

that there could be a statutorily

created right to liberty, just as there could be a statutorily
created right to property.
I should — if there is any confusion on —
QUESTION?

But if the — but whatever it is, it —

you're talking about something rooted in state law?
MR. ALSUP;
QUESTIONS
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTIONs

That's correct? or in a federal statute.
Yes, but here in state law.
That's correct, Your Honor.
And I take it if the Supreme Court of

Nebraska next month were to say that the federal government's
construction of its parole statute was wrong, and that it's a
purely discretionary thing, the government's argument would be
somewhat differant in this ease?

27
MR. MjSUP*

Xf the Surpem© Court of Nebraska were

t© give an authoritative ruling saying that this statute
does not mean what it appears to mean, and it9s a purely
discretionary parole proceeding with no rights or entitlement
to release upon certain conditions, then we would take th©
position that there would be no due process hearing required.
So X think the answer is, Mr. Chief Justice
Rehnquist, yes, if they were to change the law ~
QUESTIONYou flatter me.
QUESTION:

Mr. Alsup, on that point, supposing

Nebraska said that the revocation of parole shall be purely
discretionary with the parole board? can do it on a hunch, for
any arbitrary reason.

So there would be no reasonable

expectation ©£ continued parole if th© board decided to change
its mind.
Would such a statute be constitutional, in your
judgment?
MR. ALSUPs

Let me respond, Mr. Chief Justice

Stevens, in two respects:
First, there might be a cruel and unusual punishment
problem with such a form ©£ punishment that allowed an
individual to go back into his community to re-establish roots
with his family, and then for an arbitrary and capricious
reason to be ripped out of that environment.
Whether tor not that would unconstitutional on that
ground, X ean?t say, but certainly such an issue would arise.

28
QUESTION s

Just under the rational® of Morrissey

against Brewer,, going n© -=• just staying within the four
corners ©f that opinion

would the statute I described be

constitutional or unconstitutional, in your view?
MR. ALSUP:

Again, not t© fight the hypotheticals too

much, I think the Court —
QUESTION s

You discuss it in your brief at some

length.
MR. ALSUP:

Well, I think we would have to say, if

in fact it were a purely discretionary right to revoke, then
the particular person out on parole would have no legitimate
expectation of continuing with his liberty.
2 have to say, Mr, Justice Stevens, I don’t think
thatwuld ever occur.
QUESTIONs

Well, would it follow then that such a

statute would be constitutional*?

Are you saying that even on

parole revocation that the parolee*s right to a hearing is
entirely based on a statutory grant?
MR. ALSUP:

Let’s see if 2 understand the circum­

stances
We have a parolee who has been released subject to the
normal conditions, and in addition there is a statute which allows
the board to revoke, parole at a whim?
QUESTION:

That’s right, and with the — and the

parole»©, when he’s released, gets a copy of a statuta sad he’s

29
told. If we get worried about fehe way you’re behaving, even
if we don’t have any proof ©f anything at all, w© have the
power to revoke your parol© like that.
Is such a statute constitutional?
MR. ALSUP:

There might be a problem with ausueh a

statute under the division wthat was apparent in the Court in
the Arnett ease, in which some of the justices took the
position that a substantive right could b© prescribed by th©
state legislator©, but the procedure for revoking it could not
be.
I believe sisc justices rejected the position that
such arbitrary procedures could be —
QUESTIONs

Well, I’m familiar with the Arnett ease.

1 -m just curious about whether th© government has a position
on the question which I've asked you* which you’re willing to
identify for us.
MR. ALSUP?
QUESTXON:

Well, Mr. ~
You’ve surely thought about it before you

came here today.
MR. ALSUP:

Well, that of course is not the ease

that's presented hare.
QUESTIONS

Well, I know.

But if you decline t©

answer, just say so.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION %

Well, 1 would say ~
If you have a position, I’d like t© know

30

what it is,
MRo ALSUP:

W@ do not have a position, and I can

only say that there would be an Arnett v. Kennedy problem,
QUESTIONs

Well, the federal system particularly,

and many of the states, inmates are released ©n what's now
called ''work release/1 very frequently independently ©£ any
statute and independent of the parol® system,

They're allowed

fe© go somewhere and work on a job and report back.
Mow, would you think that once an inmate is allowed
to'go and work on s job he's acquired some new or different
interest from what he had before he was allowed to go on a
work release program?
MR. ALSUPs

la such a case as that, Mr, Chief Justice,

I think the government's position would be clear if most ©f
these work-furlough programs are of short durations up to
30 days.

And it is an absolute condition of any of those

work-study or work-release programs that the warden or the
bureau of prisons has the absolute authority to terminate the
program or liberty at any time.
Under those circumstances, under a statute ©r
regulation which conferred no entitlement t© work release or
furlough, we would say there would be no right to a due process
hearing at all.
Because there has been some questions raised about the
federal parol® system, perhaps I should tak© just a moment

31
to draw the Court's attention to two features of the federal
parol® statute which,, at least for purposes of the issue that9s
presented here,, distinguish the federal parole system*
Unlike the Nebraska statute.* which creates a
presumption that a prisoner will be released at the first
moment of eligibility ©r shortly thereafter* the United
States Parole Commission statute establishes at most a
that the prisoner will be released at some time
during the guidelines established by the United States
Parole Commission.
The Commission is absolutely free in its discretion
to select'

a data within that guideline range,

although if the

Commission selects a date outside the guideline range* the
Commission must have good cause to do so.
Because the Commission has absolute discretion to
select a data within the guideline rang®* under the position that
we have taken* no due process hearing at all would be required
so long as the release data that is selected does fall within
that guideline period.

Now that's under the statuta itself.

1 should hasten

to say as a second distinguishing feature* that by regulation the
Unite! States Parol® Commission has adopted a procedure of
setting a presumptive release date* which very soon after the
prisoner arrives at the federal institution* which tells the
prisoner that on — for example* March 3rd* 1981* the prisoner

32
will be released, so long as a — there’s good behavior? B,
a satisfaetor release plan is established? and finally, there’s
no subsequent new information which comes to light which shows
that the original plan was a mistake in the first place — or
the original date was a mistake,,
Now, in fast, just by regulations issued yesterday
by the Parole Commission, this presumptive release date practice
has now been extended -QUESTION ?
MR. MiSUP:

Federal?
That’s correct.

This federal procedure

of a presumptive release date has now been extended by
© regulation issued yesterday f© virtually all federal
prisoners.
The significance of that is that under the position
of the United States, once a presumptive release date is set,
subject to those conditions, it cannot be changed or altered
without some sort of a due process hearing.
With respect to the merits, it is our position that
denial of parole drequires a due process hearing only where
the statute ©r regulations or some mutual expectation, as the
7
Court said in the Laos v. Flynt case''’ last Monday, exists to
create an entitlement to release.
We think this follows from two propositions:

First,

the denial of parole itself does not result in a deprivation
of liberty.

A deprivation of liberty occurs ©n conviction.

33

The denial of parol® continues the incarceration
under that lawfully imposed sentence»
Now, if the Court accepts that argument, then the
remainder of the argument seems to foe dictated by this
Court8® decision since Roth, in which the questionhas been
vary clearly posed in terns of whether or not the state or
federal statute or some custom has created an entitlement
under given circumstances.
Here the Nebraska statute does create an entitlement
to release, as the court ©f appeals found, upon ~ subject fc©
the feasance upon

of the four conditions.

And we -believe

that doss fall within this Court8® definition of what an
entitlement -QUESTIONS
you say.

Well, the court of appeals found that,

But there wasn't a single Nebraska judge on the

court of appeals, was there?
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTION;
MR. ALSUP %

I’m not sure what states -I am, and there wasn’t any.
Well, 1 can only say that they’re

responsible, and they take cases from the district court of
Nebraska.

And in the past this Court has been willing to defer

to the court of appeals9 understanding of the stats law
involved.
QUESTIONt

Sometimes

you

defer

a little bit

more-when there is a judge of the particular state sitting on

34
the panel, although that doesn't right as to constitutional
dimensions,, of course.
MR. ALSUP:
QUESTIONt

Well, quite right, Mr. Chief Justice.
Sometimes we defer when it's even a

different circuit than that of the state involved.
?

Poleeki.
QUESTION;
MR. ALSUP;

Poleeki.
Well, whether or not there should be

deference in this case, it does appear that th© plain
langxiage of the statute does provide a presumption of
release subject to the feasance — one of the four conditions.
QUESTION;

Mr. Alsup, are you using entitlement as

a synonym for property.
Is that it?
QUESTION;
MR. ALSUP;

Either one.
No.

An entitlement either to liberty or

to property.
QUESTION:

And you don't choose?

Here nent.itlament

for what?
MR. ALSUP;

It looks more like liberty than property,

but because it is an entitlement, and because both liberty and
property are used together in the due process clause, we think
that the analsysis with respect to each would be the same,
whether or not there is some entitlement, either to liberty or
to property.

35
With respect to what process is due , there is
normally the due process cases in this Court have addressed
the full panoply of rights or components under hearing.
In this particular case, the petition only raised
two issues.

One of those issues was whan should the hearing

be held, not what the components should be.

And the other

issue is whether or not a summary of the evidence or facts
should

'be required.
In mv remaining time I would like to address briefly

just the first of those.
It is a very important question that differentiates
parole release from parole revocation, intertwined with the
question of when the hearing itself should be held.
Unlike the case in Morrissey where the revocation
hearing had to come, in the wake of the alleged violation, here
we have a sensitive process of monitoring the progress of an
inmate.

And the very question itself of determing when is

the most propitious moment to hold a hearing is itself a
delicata question subject to the expertise of the parole
board„
And for that reason, we would sugeest that perhaps
the court of appeals was in error in mandating that that
hearing be held at the first moment of eligibility, rather
than perhaps at a moment when a hearing might really do the
inmates more good.

36
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Well, Mr. Alsup, thank

you.
Mr. Ridenour.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN K. RIDENOUR, ESQ. f
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RIBENHQUR;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The crucial and overriding question presented by this
case is the fundamental fairness of parole release proceedings
in the state of Nebraska.
QUESTIONs

What do you think about the question I put

first to your friend; If a judge who has the option to grant
probation at the time of the verdict permits a hearing,
an argument, on whether it should he granted, and then simply
without any elucidation denies probation, and sentences the
defendant to a traditional term.
Must he give reason?
MR. RIDENOUR;

I would start first from the

proposition, Your Honor, that in the sentencing process that
there has typically not bean a requirement for a statement of
reasons for the sentencing judges.
QUESTION;

No, I'm trying to find out — X!m trying to

see if there's some analogy.
What if -- then carry it on.

Suppose he, the counsel

says, I6d like to argue and present some evidence as to why

37

you should grant probation here.

And the judge says, no, I

don't need any arguments and 1 don't need any evidence.
decide this matter on my own.

And he adjourns court.

I’ll
And

enters later, or at this very time, imposes a sentence, 10 to
30 years, 3 to 9 nyears.
Must he give reasons?

Must he conduct the hearing

that's been requested?
MR. RIDENOURs

He, of course — in the concept and

the process of the criminal proceeding, the inmate ~ or the
individual has been accorded a great deal

of due process.

The

facts on which the judge will base his opinion -QUESTION:

Well, but now thates all been terminated

with a verdict of the jury.
MR. RIDENOUR:

Correct, Your Honor.

But the judge

is acquainted with the facts that came through that process.
And that's the facts that will influence his decision as to
whether or not to grant probation? as to whether or not —what sentence is going to be applied.
QUESTION;
that permits

But in most states, you'll find a statute

the judge to grant probation.

Does that create a reasonable expectation that the
judge might, grant probation?
MR. RIDENOUR:

It creates a reasonable expectation

on my line that the judge might grant probation, and — the
due process has been accorded throughout the criminal

38
proceedings accords the inmates — or the individual what
ha's entitled to.
As to your question on reasons, I think there’s a
fundamental distinction between sentencing and the parole
system.

In sentencing, if you deny --if you indicate you

are not. going to grant probation, there is no function served,
as such, by the reasons.
It does not advise that individual of anything he
could do to get, probation in the future.

It’s a decision made

at that point.
On the other hand, in the parole process, if you
advise the inmate of the reasons for his denial of parole,
then as — at a future time he can work — or as he goes
along, he can work on those items, and attempt to convince the
board at his next hearing that he should be granted parole.
QUESTIONs

Isn’t that almost exactly the same thing

if the judge is required to say why ha is denied probation,
then denies it, and th©person goes to the institution, he
has a little bit of: the idea of what he should do in order to
qualify for parole.
Is that not so?
MR. RIDENOUR:

I'm not frankly certain, Your Honor,

that the factors, or considerations, would ba precisely the
same in a probation versus a parole concept.
I agree with you.

It would probably help the

39

inmate, though* to know something about what he should be
doing to correct his personality problems, whatever they
may be, so that he can better convince the parole board to
grant him parole„
But that might be several years -- three, four,
five years off.

And the parole board’s attitudes may be

significantly different than what that sentencing judge's
attitudes may be.
As the Solicitor General has argued here, a
liberty interest is created by the statutes of the state of
Nebraska.

That interest is routinely deprived by the practices

employed by the Nebraska parole board.
What has not yet been pointed out to the Court with
any specificity is the stage at which the parole release
decision is made in the state of Nebraska, and the lack of
procedural protections which are there afforded.
In fact, the parole release decision is seldom made
at the final parol® haering.

Rather it is made in the state

of Nebraska at a ease and record review, a proceeding at
which few if any procedural safeguards are employed.
In these reviews, the inmate is not entitled to
present evidence, either documentary or alive.
entitled to the assistance of counsel ©r

He is not

'counsel substitutes.

He is not entitled to see, hear or know of any adverse
information received or considered by the board.

40
Indeed, the most fundamental of the procedural
protections, his presence at that hearing, is in practical
reality, denied.
The Board of Parole in Nebraska conducts these
review hearings on two days of each month, during the period
of July 1, 1975, through June 30, 1976, they conducted 1,645
of these on those two days out of each month.
That averages out to about 7 minutes per hearing,
at which the Board's principle function is to ask the inmates
a few questions and then excuse him from the room while they
make their determination.
QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Ridenour, do you suggest that

litigants are entitled to be present at our conference
following the open sessions of the court?

Because that's

where wq really decide the case, even though they had an
opportunity to have their counsel argue it in open court?
MR. RIDENOUR;
that at all.

No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting

I'm suggesting that an inmate is entitled to

at least an appearance before that board, at which he has a
realistic opportunity to make his case, if you want to call
it that, known to the paroles board, as to why he should be
granted parole,.
I'm saying Nebraska, in effect, denies that right.
QUESTION;

But he does have an opportunity to appear

before the parole board, doesn't he?

41
MR,. RIDENOUR;

For five minutes a t a review

hearing.
QUESTION;

Wall, do you say that we are prohibited

by our constitution from limiting arguments to, say, 30
minutes?
MR. RIDENOUR;

I think as a requirement,, no, I

don't think that you're prohibited by the constitution from
limiting arguments to 30 minutes.

I don't think you're

required to give me an argument at all in this ease.

You

could submit the ease on briefs and decide it on that basis.
QUESTION;

We decide more cases without arguments

than with arguments, don't we?
MR. RIDENOUR;

Certainly.

But you're not affecting,

Your Honor, my — you know, my interests. You're not affecting
me, the person appearing before you, statements.

In the parole

context, in the risk of the erroneous decisions inherent in
the types of records that parola boards deal with and the
types of discretionary decisions that they make, that inmate
must have — or his counsel or someone must have — the ability
to examine those records and to make corrections and to appear
before that board and make his case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ridenour, what if the Nebraska law

had simply list id these factors, just like they area, but said
the decision shall be entirely within the discretion of the
parole officers and not subject to judicial; just completely

42
within the discretion of the parole authorities?
MR. RIDENOUR:

I think the very listing of factors

Your Honor,, regardless of the preparatory language in the
statute, limits in some effect that discretion.

It channels

it and directs it.
QUESTION:

Well, but the statute says, all you have

to do -- here are the factors, now you apply them.

But I

suppose you could say, couldn't you, and I think our cases
might indicate this, if you could have a liberty of property
interests but no right to procedures.
Simply because a hearing would do no good.
MR. RIDENOUR:

But I believe in the contort we're

dealing with, Your Honor, a hearing in fact will do good.
Because there are objective factors required to be
considered by the Nebraska statute, because you shall -- the
board shall consider these fourteen factors —
QUESTION:

I know, but what.

at the most, so far,

all you’re saying is that the inmate should be assured that
they went through the procedures.
MR. RIDENOUR:

That they had considered the

factors and that the factors were in fact correct.
QUESTION:

That hasn!t very much to do with a

hearing?
MR. RIDENOUR:

It does in the sense that it gives

the inmates the ability to know whether the factors considered

43
ware correct,
QUESTION2

Well, what if the statute said that

when they were through they cwould certify what they did.
We considered the following factors, and we
exercised our discretion, and we arrived at this conclusion.
And if you had a hearing, if you put then? on the stand, they
would say, yes,, we considered everyone of them.

And the

statute says -- the result is within your discretion.
Now, would due process require any more than that?
MR. RIDENOUR:

Due process requires

or the

state statute in the first place, Your Honor, requires that
those factors be considered.

Many of those factors can come

only from the inmate, and the only opportunity he would have
is either through a written submission or ~
QUESTION:

Or ha might have an opportunity to make

sure he they7 considered them,
MR, RIDENOUR:

I would suggest that a written

submission, Your HOnor, in the case of many inmates, would
not be an adequate opportunity for that inmate to make
his case.
There are many inmates who simply cannot express
themselves in writing, cannot bring forth the factual
information they might need.

They need the opportunity to

appear before ihat board to have a meaningful chance to
talk to that board, to make a case for parole.

44
QUESTION %

You think he should ba able to testify

or call witnesses?
MR. RIDENOUR;

I do, Your Honor.

Let me clarify, I think, in that respect why I
think that is true.
In Nebraska there are two types of parole
proceedings;

the review hearing and the final hearing.

It's at the review hearing that the decision is typically
made.

They decide at the review hearing whether the inmate

should be set for a final hearing in the case.
It8s used as a screening device.

I would suggest to the Court in Nebraska that the
final hearing is in fact simply confirmation of the prior
decision of the board at the review hearing? roughly — well,
in a six month period, 375 inmates at Nebraska who were
eligible for parole ware denied that final hearing on the
basis of the review hearing.
Now at the final hearing, Nebraska statutes
permit ~
QUESTION;

How long would it take for a hearing

I shudder —

MR. RIDENOUR;

I sadder at the thought, too.

If

all hearings ware to have lawyers at them, and it was of a
very adversary nature.
I don't suggest that it should be anything but

But I think ~ but the inmate should have the

opportunity to bring in the witness for an informal
discussion if he has a witness who indeed can present

QUESTIONs

.«rid he doesn't need a lawyer'?

He can

MR, RIDENOUR;

We are not contending here that he

has a right to an attorney, in these type of proceedings.
Nebraska at final hearings permits the inmate, if he can
afford counsel on his own, to have those -- to have counsel,
present.
QUESTION;

I think you mentioned 645 hearings —

MR. RIDENOUR;

1,643.

QUESTION; — seven minutes, seven minutes was the
average.

That's my computation

of the

testimony —•
QUESTION:

I take it that means that some hearings

might have been 30 minutes and some mig It have bean 3

MR. RIDENOUR;
in review hearings,

It's not my understanding, Your Honor,

that many ~ there would be a rare

exception that any would run 30 minutes.

The testimony of the

chairman of the board of parole was that in general these
hearings take no longer than 10 minutes.

48

QUESTION;

Of course, in many courts, including

this one, some matters are resolved with finality with
no

not only no hearings, no discussion, just after the

justices have reviewed the papers.
Do you suggest there's any denial of due process
there?
HR. RIDENOUR;

No, I think most cases arising in

this Court, however, corns from lower courts where there was,
in fact, a great deal of due process accorded.

And that's

significantly different in the parol© situation.
QUESTION s

Well now whan you talk about the informal

procedure, the very purpose, historic purpose, of procedure
and formality is to speed up the process instead of letting
people just wander all over the lot and talk at will in any
form they want.
So how much time do you think it would take to
conduct all the hearings that you're talking ahoiut?
MR. RIDENOUR;

I think it first needs to be

remembered? —
QUESTION t

Have you done a calculation on that?

MR. RIDENOUR;
that.

No, I have not done a calculation on

But for each of the formal hearings — in the words of

the board, they would call it a formal hearing.

Court might say was applicable.

What would you guess, that that would

double, or treble, or add fifty percent or add —MR» RIDENOURs

It would approximately double the

number of formal hearings that were likely to be held by the
Nebraska parole board during the year.
I don't believe that that adds a significant burden,
or it's a burden that anean be easily handled.
five members, apparently.

They have

All five members sit at every

formal hearing.
The Nebraska statute does not require that.

It

requires only a majority of the board members to sit at the
hearings„
QUESTION:

Do you think we should tell Nebraska

how many of its parole officers should sit in their hearings?
MR. RIDENOURs
Nebraska that.

No, this Court should not tell

I simply say that because this Court has,

under its cown cases, concerned with an analysis of what
the burden is to the state of the additional safeguards that
it might employ.
I'm saying that the burdens incurred in this case
wouldn't be burdens that could be handled by the Nebraska
board of parole, both because they have the extra members

48
that they could utilise,, and because it would result in a
like reduction in the mirabar of review hearings that would
be held.
I do not argue that there is not some increased
burden to the state.

I say simply that the interests of the

inmate and his liberty outweigh that burden.
The discussion we have been having, of course,
assumes the applicability of the due process clause to
parole release proceedings.
That analysis requires an examination of the
nature of the interests at stake.
The analysis must begin, 1 think, with an examination
of Nebraska statutory provisions.

it shall order his release, unless it is of the opinion that
his release should be deferred because — it lists then the
four statutory grounds on which parole may.be denied.

you wouldn't have any case at all?
MR, RIDENOUR:
Your Honor,

Do you concede that?

No, I do not concede that at all,

I say that the simplest and easiest grounds that

this Court can find for

Ety

clients on is on the basis of that

statute,
I think there's a larger question involved in this
case, obviously, as to whether an inmate has a constitutional
liberty interest in parole, separate and paparte from the
Nebraska statute,
QUESTION:

At least in being fully and fairly

considered for parole,
MR, RIDENOUR:

At least in that respect.

Whether

it be considered the right to parole, or the right to be
fully considered, it's the same result, I think, to my
clients.
They have a right to due process at that release
proceeding,
QUESTION:

— because he doesn't have any liberty

now.
MR. RIDENOUR:

I agree with you in that respect,

I think Nebraska's statute goes almost as far to
create, in essence, a statutory entitlement to parole, not

to — it also creates a statutory entitlement to consideration
for parole.
But it goes almost as far as saying a statutory

f

50

entitlement to parol©.
QUESTION 2

Mr. Ridenour, could I ask you a question

about the stipulation of facts that appears at pages 30 and
31 of the Appendix?
MR. RIDENOUR;
QUESTION:

Certainly, Your Honor.

Paragraph on© says discretionary parole

is used by the Nebraska Board of Parole as a release on
parole by virtue of an exercise of discretion on the part of
the board of parole.
Is that something different than what we9re talking
about here?
MR. RIDENOUR?

No.

We are talking about discretionary

parole.
Discretionary parole is the term that the state has
long used in describing the process.

I don’t think by the

stipulation that we mean to say that it’s been exercised solely
at discretion, or that that discretion is unbridled or
unchanneled by the state statutes however.
QUESTION;

Well, but you say in the stipulation that

it is a release on parole by virtue ©£ an exercise of
discretion on the board of parole.
MR. RIDENOUR;

I do not deny that there are large

elements of discretion in the parole release proceeding,

But

I suggest that the Nebraska statutas channel and instruct the
parol© board on how to exercise that discretion.

And under

51
those circumstances, there's a statutory entitlement to a
fair consideration of parol®.
In discussing that very statute, the National
Advisory Commission on the Criminal Justices Standards and
Goals, stated that th® model penal code represents a
turnaround in the traditional assumption that the burden of
proof, however,evaluation, rests on the inmate.
It proposes that an inmate is to be released on
parole when he is first eligible unless one of the four
conditions escist.
I suggest to th® Court that the statute therefore
creates a presumption in favor of release, defeasible only
if one of a limited number of grounds for denial is found to
be present.
This case thus is unlike Me a. chum v, F&no where there
was no such

statutory entitlement.

You're asking me do I think he's

Part of the risk in the Nebraska procedure, and I

QUESTION?

That's what we suggested in Morrissey

as the only reason for holding it.
But suppose there6s only one John McCormack Doe in
the entire prison, and the chairman says, check this out, and
they say, yes, there's only one.
MR. RIDENOUR?

I certainly agree with your Honor

that in some extreme circumstances we're going to know, and
the parole board is going to know beforehand, that a hearing
and perhaps the inmate will know, is essentially useless.
But in many cases I think it 'will be very useful

53
both to the inmate and the board.
And if the court can instruet us on how to draw a
line between what will be useful and what won't from that
standpoint, I think, you know, it would be very helpful to
all concerned.
But absent that kind of a line, I think that all of
those hearings are going fee have to be conducted, for the
benefit of the many over the extreme examples.
The board is ~ has argued here, and some ©f the
questions have concerned, the subjective or discretionary
nature of the decision.
I think it important to not© that this
Court's eases have required a consideration of the interests
at stake, not the natures of the hoard's proceedings, in
determining whether due process applies.
Release proceedings in my mind are two-step
processes.

The first is a fact-gathering process, through the

file, through the social history ©f the inmates, through the
correctional department talking to the employee — people h®
may ha employed by.
It gathers many of the objective facts that the
parol® board will consider in the exercise of its discretion,
that discretion being the second step in the parole process.
But it8 s significant and important to the inmate
that they have the ability to insure that the facts upon

54
which that predictive expertise of the parole board is
exercised are accurate and correct, in order to prevent the
occurrence of inaccurate decisions based on inaccurate facts.
Briefly, I'd like to call feo the Court's attention
as well the notice provisions undertaken by the state of
Nebraska at the parole proceedings.
In the state of Nebraska, at a parole release
review hearing, or at a final hearing, if the inmate is either
deferred or denied parole, he's informed of the month during
which he will next appear before the board.
He is not advised, howeveer, as to the date or the
hour at which that hearing will occur.

That information is

supplied to the inmate only on the day of the actual hearing
through the posting of

a list at the penal complex of the

inmate who will be heard on that day.
In notifying the inmates of the reasons for denial,
particularly following a review hearing, the notice takes on
the effect of being almost meaningless to the inmate.

The

board uses a pre-printed form, called a PB-1, an example of
which is located at page 35 of the Appendix.
While the Board contains the statutory ground.— ©r
the form contains the statutory grounds for denial of parole,
the board simply checks it off without explanation of what the
specific facts on which it is relying are.
In 80 percent of the eases it cheeks Item A,
which reads, your continued correctional treatment, vocational

55
educational, or job assignment in the facility will
substantially enhance your capacity to lead a law-abiding
life whan released at a later date.
No explanation is ever given on this form to the
inmate as to which of the alternatives listed in that item
apply to him, and no response is made to an inmate if he
requests the board specifically to tell him whether it is
correctional treatment, vocational treatment, educational
treatment, ©r job assignment that they are concerned with.
The second part of the form is entitled; correction

of deficiencies.

It's commendable that the board would want

to tell the inmate whow to correct their deficiencies.

But

six listed deficiencies are stated on that form, and in
379, I think the figure is, out of 385 eases covered in the
survey in the back of the appendix, the inmates had all six
items checked, items such as, join self-improvement club,
regardless of the fast that the inmate was a member of every
self-improvement club at the penitentiary.

Yes, Your Honor.

Would you tell n& a little bit about the

board in Nebraska, how large is it, how is it selected, for

QUESTION;

Well, that's — they do have & staff?

MR. RIDENOUR?
how large that staff is.

They do have a staff? I do not know
They do much of their own work.

I

will acknowledge that they do much of their own, and that we
are treating a system which may, indeed, require them to hire
additional staff or putting on hearing examiners.
QUESTIONs

board?

Three permanent, subject to the jurisdiction

of the same individual in charge of the penal system, or are

57
They are independent.

MR. RIDENOUR;
QUESTION;

They are compensated.

All five of them are compensated.

MR. RIDENOUR;

No, they meet more frequently than

that.
QUESTION;

I thought somebody said ~

MR. RIDENOUR;
conduct hearings

or.

They have five days that they

during each month.

One of those days is

at the women's reformatory for the uyouth offenders; two of
the days are spent on final hearings — the two days that I
was referring to are spent on review hearings.
That'3 the general practice throughout the year.
QUESTION;

But you're not suggesting that the

part-time people put in only two days a month in the aggregate?
MR. RIDENOUR;

No, I'm not, Your Honor.

I really

could not tell you how much, bxtt I assume they do spend some
time beforehand looking at the files, at least for the final
hearings.
The review hearings, I think the process is generally
to open the file at the hearing and look at it at that point.
That's because of the sheer numbers they're dealing with.
With respect to the interests at stake, I can say

58

only that in Morrissey, the Chief Justice indicated that the
liberty of a parolee ,although indeterminate, includes many
of the core values of unqualified liberty? by whatever name,
that liberty is valuable, and must be seen as within the
protection of the Fourteenth Amendment,
I submit to this Court that there is not a siemificant
difference between the present liberty interest, whether it be
created by statute or arise from the constitution.
And tills Court should conclude that parole in
Nebraska — and parole release decisions -- are subject to the
due process clause, and that in order for Nebraska to comply
with the due process clause, the inmate must be afforded, a
reasonable advance notice of hearing; a record of those
proceedings; and an opportunity — and a written statement of
the reasons for denial, including the essential facts relied
upon, so that he may specifically know what it is that he needs
to do to correct his behavior and to perhaps gain parole at a
future time.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj

Very well.

Do you have

something further, counsel?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH H. GILLAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GILLAN;

I believe not, Your Honor, except that

I will say that the Attorney General's office does not work
with the parole board on a daily basis, so we are not

59
intimately familiar with the procedures as Mr. Ridenour
indicated.
I will answer one question.

They serve six-year

terms, and they have a secretarial staff only.
There are parole counsellors at the penitentiary,
but they do not serve under the parole board, and the parole
board has no control of them.
The only staff that the parole board has is
secretarial.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:43 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.3
