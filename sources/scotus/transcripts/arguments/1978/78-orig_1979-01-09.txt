PROCEED I N G S
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

next in California against Arizona and the United States»
Mr» Goodman# I think you may proceed whenever you8re
ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN J. GOODMAN# ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
MR» GOODMANs

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court*
This ease comes to this Court upon the State of
California*© motion for leave to file complaint against the
State ©£ Arizona and against the United States»

By our motion

we seek to invoke this Court's original and exclusive juris*»
diction to finally determine title to sovereign lands along an
11.3->mile reach of feh® Colorado River.
The lands in issue in this action are sovereign lands#
and were at the time of California’s admission to the Union

V
within the bed. of the Colorado River»
Along t!i® river# as the Court knows# there have been
many accretive and avulsive changes.

Tries© river movements

generated serious confusion and controversy until 1966 when#
by an Interstate Boundary Compact# ratified by Congress in
that year# the political boundary between the two States was
set and permanently fixed forevermore»
QUESTION:

Is it agreed# Mr. Goodman# that the lands

4
ia question h©r© are within the political boundaries of

California?
MR. GOODMANs

Mr. Justice Blackmun, some of the lands

are within California entirely, some of the lands lie astride
th® Interstat® Border, the 8«6-mila southern reach of the
river»

It has a political border running approximately through

th© center, but just approximately, it does vary»

But the

political boundary will not change as a result of this
litigation, it will remain the same.

The problem w@ have here again is who aims how much
of the last riverbed does California own, how much of the
last riverbed does Arizona own?

The United States is a party

because the United States is the principal upland owner, it
owns the land adjacent to th© river.

And, as the Court knows,

the boundary line between the two States is the middle of the
main channel, and in order to fix the main channel we must
also know the bank line.
QUESTION % But there5s no question, I gather, Mr.
Clood'-.an, as to the definition of the lands, ife*s only as to the
ownership of those lands?
MR. GOODMAN?
QUESTION?

Well, you can —

In other words, you can put on a map

exactly what lane’s we8 re talking about»
,

MR. GOODMAN? We have put them on generally, and one

of the disputes is over, mainly over which riverbed is in issue

5
her©»

There were several main channels of the Colorado River

at different times»
QUESTIONS And that would change the boundaries of the
lands in dispute?
MR» GOODMANs

That would make it a substantial

difference as to where the sovereign lands were, located» As
Your Honor may recall# the.test is one of navigability of the
water course? and the question now is where was that water
sours® on the data of California®a admission in 1850, and where
has it moved by non-aecretive changes thereafter?

So

California, in 1972, because of the concern over the problem
of location of its sovereign lands, began a study at the
requast of the State Legislature»

Four years

was spent on

that study, and a set of maps was prepared during the course
of the study»

And the sotsrce of general hazard maps is on

his desk right new,

We communicated with the U. £>« Department

of Interior «“
QUESTION*
MR» GOODMAN*

You don’t have them here, do you?
They are not part of the record in the

action, the exhibits to the complaint describes by metas and
bounds, Your Honor, those lands»
QUESTION*
MR» GOODMAN*
Your Honor»

But if I may so, it doesn’t, help me»
It doesn’t help me too much either,

It requires some elaboration»

QUESTION:

Those are questions of title, though, not

6
boundary.
MR. GOODMAN?

That is correct, Your Honor, these

are questions of title.

Th© boundary questions are only if

on® finds the location of ths State lands, it's a boundary
question? it will not change the political boundaries of the
river.
QUESTION:

But you're asking »«* you want your title

quieted?
MR. GOODMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Justice White.
Well, usually to quiet title you say

what property you're quieting title to.
MR. GOODMAN:

Ws have done that in the exhibits to

the complaint, Your Honor.

We have taken, as a result of the

study which was don© in «=«•
QUESTION: Well, 1 know, but suppose the defendants
nay that you haven't described ths lands correctly?
QUESTIONt

Depending upon what you said to me as

)

for your reasons.
QUESTION?

The navigability of 1350 and so forth.

MR. GOODMANs

Well, they could then respond to the

complaint, in that
QUESTION? Well, what 7, mean, the question — I
suppose that many questions of fact could arise in this case.
MR. GOODMANt
QUESTIONs

That is —

It just isn't a question of law involved.

MR0 GOODMANg

No, it is not a question of law only,

Your Honor»
QUESTION s

That's all X wanted»

QUESTIONS

Welly wait# you answered a question of

Mr. Justice Whits, which was put in terms of your title and
you are representing the State of California.

Not/, were you

answering that question in terms of the sovereign’s title
or the title of some of the citizens of the sovereign?
MR. GOODMANs
the sovereign.

We are answering solely on behalf of

If 1 may again respond to —

QUESTION*

A vary important difference, isn't it?

That we keep.in mind here»
MR. GOODMAN?
QUESTION?

These are solely sovereign lands.

The sovereign, the title of the sovereign

lands brings us probably clear to an original jurisdiction

case,
MR® GOODMAN?
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.

-»*» whereas the title of the individual

citizens who claim it brings another question, doesn't it?
MR. GOODMAN:

Yes, it very well may, Your Honor.

QUESTION? Are these lands on the Arizona side of the
political boundary?
QUESTION;

Both.

MR® GOODMAN:

Seme of the lands are on the Arizona

side, in the 2.6“ssile upper reach of th© river they are

3

entirely within California? in the 8.6-mile lower reach they
sit astride the political boundary.
We know, if I could respond to an earlier question
of the Court? that we are in the right ballpark because wa
discussed with the United States and with the State of Arizona
their claims.

In fact? the exhibit to the complaint here is

based upon aerial surveys dons by the United States Government
earlier? so we are —
QUESTIQHs

Mr. Goodman, what I was trying to gat at

-« I'm afraid I don’t understand it fully yet;— is there
agreement between you, the United States, arid Arizona, that
you can draw on a map exactly what lands we're talking about,
til® title to 'Which you want quieted?
MR. GOODMAN?
QUESTION i

Wes are, && far as we8re —

I mean, can you answer that, yen or no?

MR. GOODMANs

Tilt) answer to that is no, Your Honor.

W@ hava bean attempting — if I could say, we know we're in
the Colorado R±v©r, we have presented our information to the
State of Arizona and the United States, and asked them to
agree.

They simply would not agree, and that is the reason

why we are before the Court today.
QUESTION? Well, what about this land there, do you
agree to that?
MR. GOODMAN?
yes or no.

They simply will not give us an answer

Arizona told us that wa would have to sue them in

order to gat a response
QUESTIONs Well; do you agree

that that is the map

of feii© assistant?
MR® GOODMAN a

Well, this is a map adopted by the

California State Lands Commission, which is the basis for the
Exhibit 'A t© the complaint,,
QUESTIONs

So you don’t want to go behind that,

d© you?
MM* GOODMAN*
QUESTION*

Isin sorry?
You agree to that end, don't you?

MR* GOODMANs
QUESTION*

Oh, yes, we are quite sure
Well, doss the government agree to that?

MR® GOODMAN:

I don't know®

I'm afraid, Mr® Justice

Marshall, that you'll have to ask the Solicitor General®

I

do not know whether they agree or not® They have said, in their
response, =“
QUESTION s

Right, I agree with my brothers, I have

great problems in deciding when I don't know what 1 have.
I'm going to decide that a strip of land, which I
don't know anything about, and I don't know where the land is,
belongs to California?
MR® GOODMAN* Well, I think, should the Court, grant
the motion and appoint a Special Master, then the Master would
taka evidence on the subject and the lands would become fixed®
We think that, we are in the right ballpark, and the partias

can agra® *=>“ if 1 make ~
QUESTIONz

For example# you’ve got a strip of land

hare. That I can understande hut you say you don’t know where
the strip of land is.
MR» GOODMANs

Nof Your Honor# California knov/s where

it thinks the strip of land is.
QUESTIONS

You say you know where you think it is?

MR» GOODMANs

Well# we know where the land is§ the

problem is created by the meanderings of the course of the
river.

That is the essential problem in all interstate

boundary river eases# «=*=■
QUESTIONS

Sure.

MR® GOODMANs

* if you will# and th.e problem is to

establish the exact perimeters of that land. This case is no
different than an Interstate river boundary case in that
respect.
QUESTION s

Welle your mates and bounds description

will vary from Arizona to California# because they use different
meridians«.
MR. GOODMANs We have accounted for that# Your Honor#
in the description.

It’s dona on the California coordinate

system with certain «=>«=•
QUESTION %
MR. GOODMANs

The San Bernardino Base:, ■ Meridian?
That.93 exactly correct# Your Honor.

Ther® are two principal issues of a legal natur®

II
before the Court at this time, Th® first one is whether this
case is within this Court"s original and exclusive jurisdiction,
or whether, as Arisons phrased the question, may Arizona consent
to an action in a district court?
The United Skates and California both agreed on this
issue that Arizona may not consent to that jurisdiction«
The second Issue has made the United STates be sued in this
Court for a suit properly brought only in the district court®
Let me turn then to the issue of original and
exclusive jurisdiction for feh© issue of consent*
QUESTIONS

|

Well, it®s th© presence of the United

States that causes the controversy really, doesn't it?
MR® GOODMAN %

Your Honor, I don't think so*

Because,

as the Court said, albeit in dicta, in United ^atevs, Nevada,
the presence of the United States as a party is not ■=**" would
not change the essential original jurisdiction of the action*
I belisve the language is — at least the Court's
language was that*

this section has bean construed as applicable

to suits involving conflicting STate claims by ones State
against another, regardless of the presence of the United
States as a party*
^

Of course this Court has concurrent, albeit not
in
exclusive, jurisdiction/actions between tha State and United
Statas
Arizona's contention, however, is based, we submit.

12
upon a misconstruction of the term 65 jurisdiction*.

As we

define it, it is the authority to hear and adjudicate disputes.
And in this particular instance, States and the United States,
because of 'their status as parties, confer that kind of
jurisdiction.
The answer — the basis for our contention is found
in Claus©

1 of Article XZX ©£ Section: 2 ©f the Constitution,

which d©@s confer those two types of jurisdiction ,
QUESTIONS Well, are you suggesting that «■» are you
suggesting that £t8@ because of the Constitution that Arisona
and California may not litigata in the district court, even if
both of the® consent?
MS. GOODMANt
QUESTION8

No, Mr. Justice White, I «•That it’s just because of statute, across

section 1.251?
MR® GOODMAN t

1 recognise that esarly on this Court

held that the Clause 2 of Article III, Suction 2, did not
preclude suits between States in

lower courts; but the Congress,

in the first Judiciary Act, continued to this day, provided
that “*» until 1948, it was «« if a suit, if any State were a
\

party after *48, if the controversy were between two States,
that this Court has exclusive as wall as original jurisdiction.
The problem with Arizona’s contention is that they
are confusing, if you will, the question of whether a party
ean be served with the question of whether a court: has power

to adjudicate, to hear and decide the dispute.
QUESTION# Well# what do you do with 134«5Cf) then?
It says that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
MR® GOODMAN:

Mr® Justice Rehnquist, the answer to

■that lies in the legislative history ©f Section 1346(f).
When the section was enacted as part of Public Law 92-562# ifc
began as S.216.

At feha tins® of th© introduction there was

no rout® exclusive in Section 1346(f)? but th© Justice Depart*»
meat sent a letter which is quoted «=■■=* part of which is quoted
in our brief# in the footnote in our motion# which indicate»
which says that th© purpose of th© addition of the terra
"exclusive” was to preclude suits in the State Courts.

The

United States did not want to be named as a party in Stata
courts, but to have its claims adjudicated solely in federal
courts.
Thus, 'the only purpose for the term "exclusive" was
to surmount the problem created, for example, or discussed,
for example, in Chariaa^_Dowdi Box Co,

vs.

Courtneye whereby

State courts have concurrent jurisdiction unless it is
specifically excluded.

That is tha sole meaning for the term

"exclusive".
t

QUESTIONi Certainly that does not ~~ your answer does
not comport with th® use of those terms in Section 28 u.eS8ce
1251, which is tha Judiciary Act of 1739, where the Congress
said th© Suprema Coart shall .have original ®r.& exclusive

jurisdiction of, where it was talking about this Court as
opposed to lower federal courts.
MR. GOODMAN:

I think 'the term 11 exclusive" is used

in two different respects, Mr. Justice Rahnquist.

In 1346(f)

the sol© purpose of the term is to preclude suits in State
courts, and thates born© out by the legislative history.
Thar© is nothing in th© legislative history which
indicates any intention to preclude this suit (sic) from
hearing eases which are within its original jurisdiction.
tod let me continue on that point, because it is very
important.

For a party to construe a 1346(f) as precluding a

suit in this Court would foa to be denying this Court juris­
diction vested in this Court by the Constitution.

It has bean

clear sine® Marlboro vs» Madison at least that the Congress
doss not have the power to either increase or decrease this
Gourt's original jurisdiction. So 1346(f) cannot be read to bar
a suit in this Court.
QUESTIONs

You say as a matter of prudence we ought

to con®true it that way, even though there is some doubt,
in order to avoid the constitutional ~
MR. GOODMAN*

Exactly.

In order to avoid the

unconstitutional construction, the legislative history should
be relied upon to confer — to construe 1346(f) constitutional.
QUESTIONs
file, what would

Mr. Goodman, if w® should deny leave to

California do?

15
MR, GOODMAN*

Mr, Justice Blaekmun* 1 don't think we

hav© any remedy than* We have no other forum in which we ©an
litigate both against the United States and against Arizona*
QUESTION*

Well* you certainly could sue the United

States alone in California federal court* I take it* and would
Arizona coin© in* then?
MR® GOODMAN*

By our understanding of -the juris-

dictional provision* Your Honor* under Article III* we could
not sue both Arizona and the United States in the district
court® There is no statute ■—
QUESTION*

That wasn’t my questions,

If you sued

th© United States alone in California federal court* hasn’t
Arizona indicated it would come in?
MR* GOODMAN *

It has said that it would consent* but

my first argument is* Your honor* that Arizona does not have
the power to consent because* No» 1* Article III* Section 2*
Clauses 1 and 2 do not permit* and Section 1251(a)(1) provides
this Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction in actions between

j

States,

Also to say that »“
QUESTION*

Wall* that’s an argument that there

would just be no jurisdiction in the district court* because
Congress has said 'there shall not be,
MR, GOODMAN*

That’s exactly correct* Mr, Justice,

QUESTION* Then you, could also sue* could you* sue

is
Arisons alone in ’this Court?
MR, GOODMAN2

We could sue,if the Court granted

leave to, Arizona alone in this Court®

However, we need the

United States because we cannot fix the center line ofi the
river without knowing — also having the bank lines determined,
mid the United States «“
QUESTIONi Well, could the government come in hare
optionally?
MR* GOODMANs

Well, they have suggested as much,

ans that would be fin® with us®
QUESTION? But only as to part of the lands you ~
MR* GOODMAN*

And that’s exactly the problem, Mr®

Justice, because we feel the entire area has to bs adjudicated®
QUESTIONs

What the government says is if we take

it here, some day they will corns in, but limited only to a
given segment? is that it?
MR„ GOODMAN:

That's my understanding of the

Solicitor General's brief, Your Honor,
QUESTION: But can't you cover everything with
simultaneous suits here and in California federal court?
MR, GOODMAN s

Mr® Justice Blackmun, we would not

have one judgment binding on all the parties if we tried to
do that.

That's the problem, we have two separate judgments.
The United States contention, if I could respond to

that, is that 2409a of Title 28 and 1346(f) constitute a

17
waiver of sovereign immunity only as to the district court,
From my discussion of the legislative history of Section
1346(f)* it®s clear to us and we submit that the Court should
so hold* that 1346(f) was only intended to bar suits in State

courts e
Secondly* w© don't think the United States gives
sufficient weight to 2403a®
sovereign immunity®

That is the section which waives

Also waive to the sovereign immunity should

h® literally construed®

The United States construction is

©xtremsly narrow* and If it's granted* it would mean that there
would be no forum in which we could sue both the Federal
Government and Arisons®
QUESTION* What you want to be able to do is to bring
in* in this Court* both the State and the United States as to
all the lands in dispute?
MR® GOODMAN*

We want to do it in one action * so we

I

have one an forcible judgment®

We are concerned about the —

1 would submit* Your Honor* that as a court of equity * this
Court has the power to combine the two defendant parties so
that we can have ©ne effectiva decreesotherwise* again w© do
not have a forum®
And if I may* Mr® .Justice Brennan, what is worse * if
this Court denies our motion and w© have no — and if we are
left to sue against the United States in district court and
the United States than disclaims ownership * under 2409a* sub-

18
division D, the district court must then dismiss the action»
It specifically provides that there shall be no jurisdiction.
In which case, California and Arison® would be coming back to
this Court again.

And it would be clearly within this Court's

original jurisdiction.

Now, the government’s contention is

that there are surveys whiefe are more than 12 years old,? and

even if there weren’t, by 1346(f) tha government can only b®
sued in tha district court.

However, as I indicated before

lunch, to argue that means that the Congress has removed, the
jurisdiction from this Court? and that, of course, is contrary
to Marbury va. Madison.
^©ry briefly, with respect to Arizona0s contention,
that it can defer jurisdiefelon, again that is party jurisdic­
tion in tha cases which Arizona sites, to the extent that this
supports its position, are party jurisdiction questions, and
can reserva this defendant in a district court. They cannot

there is not considering questions between two Statest but a

MR* GOODMAN*

it will be a factual difference only, I would suspect*
legal principals ©ra vary important*

The

They are important not

only t© the parties here but to other States which have *. inter*»
stats boundary problems resulting from river movements’*
QUESTION%

My concern was familiarity with some

©rpert testimony as to factual matters,not with legal matters*
MR® GOODMANi

This ©ass is extremely significant,

since Pollard*a..Lessee vs* Kagan it has bean clear that
questions of sovereign land adjudication are appropriate for
this Court®s decision*

In this particular ease, California

needs to know the location ©f it's sovereign lands and confirm
its title, so ‘that, we can (1) protest them from environmental
degradation and (2) construct recreational resources*

ORAL ARGUMENT-OF LOUIS Fa CLAIBORNE, EBQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MRe CLAIBORNE;

Mra Chief Justice# and may it please

th© Court s
Th© first question before this Court is;

Must this

ease be in this Court?
We vary much wish we could answer that question no,
partly on the ground that this Court has enough other business
than to concern itself with this relatively minor acreage, and
ifc*s not a boundary dispute, it's simply a matter of title to
land 0
And, S may add, ®o does the Office of the Solicitor
General have enough other business,,
We would welcome

&

ruling that accepting Arizona's

argument to the effect that this litigation may be appropriately
begun in the district court; but unfortunately we have not found
the

way to that conclusion»
As has already been mada clear, the obstacle is

not Article III ©f the Constitution, it's simply the prevision
©f the Judicial Cods, Section 1251(a)(1) which seems plainly
to confine a controversy between two States t© this Court alone„
fey using the word ®@HclusiveB«
St's clear, of course, that the prudanca of two
States does not require that th® case b© in this Court; they
must be ©a opposite sides, they must bs adversaries®

That much

26
was clearly settled in the Pyramid Lake ease, United States vs»_
Nevada reported in 2412 of the United States Reports9
Bat here California and Arizona are on opposite
sides of the ease, and,e© far as it appears, do dispute title
t© at least a part of the land put in question by California3s
complaints
It might be argued that because the United States is
sought to be made a defendant, one looks not at 1252(a)(1)
but rather tat 1252(b)(2), which providas that when the
United States and a State are partias the jurisdiction of this
Court is merely concurrent*
It seems to us, however, that the presence or
retinence of the United States doss not change the basic fast,
which le that this is a controversy between two States,

And,

indead, again, in the Nevada case, this Court adverted to the
fact that the parties, the State parties there, were not
adverse, and accordingly there wasn't exclusive jurisdiction
in this Courte

The Court did not notice the presence of the

United States as plaintiff, , as having any bearing on it on©
way or the othare
It seems to us that was plainly °°
QUESTIONi

Whafe would the situation be, Mr» Claiborne,

if there w®r® no problem between the two States, but you had
private action to quiet title, private, on either on© side or
the other, but with federal riparian rights involved? would

the Federal Government jest intervene in that private action?
MR®

CLAIBORNEg

Mr® Chief Justice, the private

parties could, by virtue of .2409a, sue th© United States,
sovereign immunity having bean waived by the Congress, in the
appropriate district court, and there would be no problem
whatever*
Indeed, that would bo the situation even if one
Stata were a defendant®

It's only that the two States are

disputing title that presents the problem here®
QUESTION'S Would Arison© be an indispensable party
if California sued the United States in the district court,
which it could?
MR® CLAIBORNEs

Mr® Justice Whits, I would have

thought, for the earns reasons that th© United States is an
indispensable party, so would Arizona.’

So long as it declines

to accept the Davis Lake Study which California has put before
us, which it inferentially or quietly disputes®
QUESTIONS

Mr® Claiborne, do you read 2409a as waiting

sovereign immunity only for suits in the district court?
MR® CLAIBORNEs

2409a itself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

of course does not say that®

But, at the very time when that

statutes wan written. Section 1346 of the Judicial Code was
amended under th© same legislation, so as to provide that suits
undor 2409a shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
district courts.

On© can read "exclusive*5ther© differently

than in Section 1251
It's perfectly plain, 1' think, as correctly said
by the Attorney General of California, that the purpose there
<=»« til© suggestion came from the Attorney General —- the purpose
was to prevent th© government's being sued in a State court»
She question of original casas simply did not occur
to th© mind of Congress, it seems reasonably obvious»
But, on the other hand, it seems hard to read the
word K'3ScslwsivaK in the same Judicial Coda as meaning federal
courts generally in on® case, and in 1251 meaning a particular

federal court»
QUESTIONs But if you read "exclusive" in 1246 as
meaning exclusive of this Court, there are, to put it mildly,
grava constitutional difficulties, are there not?
MR* CLAIBORNE;
Eshnqiilst®

I would have thought not, Mr» Justice

After all, if it had not been for 2409, nothing

in th© Constitution waives th® sovereign immunity of th® united
States in the ease of a suit by a State. That has always been
th® constitutional rule that a State could not sue th© United
Statas without its consent, and that problem has been resolved
over the years by th© United States agreeing to ha plaintiff
©r agreeing to intervene.
This waiver statute can constitutionally have its
limited purpose ©f allowing suits only in th© district court.
It may b® nonsense

as a matter of policy, as a matter

©f constitutional law there is no problem.
QUESTION*

What is the basis for your saying that

the united States is an indispensable party in this case?
MR. CLAIBORNEi

Mr® Justice White, for the same

reason that California has joined us in the first place, that

QUESTION® Why can't California and Arison© settle
their dispute in litigation without having the United States
involved?
MR. CLAIBORNEs Well, Mr. Justice White, the first
problem is where would they,

do that, and <■»«=>

QUESTION* Well, they'd d© it here.
MR. CLAIBORNE§

MR* CLAIBORNE:

«»«'* which is the smaller distance

that was a survey not as of that date but a survey of where

and '?*
2409, in waiving sovereign immunity, has provided
that the United States shall not have its title put in issue

If we were in the district court we would be invoking

as against this north of th© Pilot Cut*

And we say that this

MR. CLAIBORNE i

I regret to say# as I see it, the

result being the united States is indispensable as to the whole
©f the. area# the United States not having waived the sovereign
immunity m to the northern segment, the suit could not go
forward as between

the two States for that northern segment,

our participation in our title# but would limit the lawsuit to the
portion below the Cut®

Indispensable parties , wouldn; t the logic ©f your position

MR, CLAIBORNE
wise,

QUESTIONs Well, I know, but I thought what you said
earlier — I've forgotten thee© numbers ~ there just isn't any
jurisdiction in the State courts for that,
MR® CLAIBORNE2 Well, I perhaps was indulging on an
assumption, hypothetical, that I .shouldn't*
course yes, Mr* Justice Brennan.

The answer is of

Thar© is no jurisdiction in

any State court| and we say there is a© jurisdiction in any
court but this Court,

And, accordingly, of course, he should

oppose and not intervene.
That is a matter of who can waive sovereign immunity.
But that problem doesn't arise any differently in a State
court than it does in a federal court.

And leave can be

given '«■«•
QUESTION*

Well, really, I would taka it that a

suit in a State court, if the Attorney General went in and
said# Sure, here we are, serve us, sue us, and you got a judg­
ment against the United States, it sti'll wouldn't be any good.
MR, CLAIBORNEs Well, it might be more respectful
to the Court, Mr® Justie® Brennan,if he were to appear for
the purpose ©f opposing than to than to —
QUESTIONs

Well, it would be good until this Court

or perhaps the Court of Appeals got holdoof it and said there
was no jurisdiction.

Officially it would b© a valid jucgsnent.

wouldn’t it?
MR® CLAIBORNE ;

Mr* Chief Justice, it would be

wasting judicial resources®
QUESTION %

Mr® Claiborne, suppose we gave leave to

file stibjeat feo the United States intervening and the United
States intervened, and whatever reservations there were, but
within that reservation there was an adjudication which settled
the title to some particular land, say the land south of this
Cut? I would suppose you would think -the title would be
settled then?

If you intervened and submitted with respect

to that®
MR® CLAIBORNE;
QUESTION:

Exactly so®

Then what becomes of the suggestion that

title to land in a suit against the United States or involving
the United States is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
district court?

Can you waive that too, or —

MR® CLAIBORNE;

Mr® Justice White, X don’t think

1346(f) ought to be read as saying that the government’s title
can only be tried in a district court®

It’s simply that

the congressional waiver of sovereign immunity is, by inadver­
tence we assume, limited to that court®

Well, it says the exclusive jurisdiction,

MR® CLAIBORNE;

But I don11 fe «*-

Indeed, and I can’t get around those

36

QUESTIONs

It certainly deprives the State courts

of jurisdiction,. doesn't it?
MR» CLAIBORNEs

But this would not, Mr» Justice

White,
QUESTION;

You think it deprives the State court of

jurisdiction but not this Court, to adjudicate the title to
the United States?
MR. CLAIBORNEs

I don't think 1346 deprives the

State court any more than —- it's only suits under 2409 that
are limited to the district court. A suit in this Court is
not a suit under 2409, and, accordingly, it may proceed in
this Court an many such cases have in years before.
Mr. Chief Justice, perhaps because of what we said
in our brief, I should add this one word with respect to our
conclusion, our submission with respect to the disposition of
the case.

We had said in May that perhaps the Court ought

to

hold this motion or deny it without prejudice tc refiling.
Time has passed «— I may say that the United States has done
very little by way of attempting to investigate or negotiate
the settlement.

So far as I’m aware, Arizona has done no

more? and, accordingly, at this late date, it would be our
submission that California is entitled now to have its title
tried.

And we would accordingly withdraw our suggestion of

postponing action, and urge this Court to grant the motion,
with the undertaking of the United States that it would inter-

37
vene within 180 days,, so as to allow its title south of the
Pilot Gut to be finally resolved.
QUBSTXQNs

Mr. Claiborne* before you sit down* one

thing I did not understand»

If this Court were to construe

the word "exclusive" in 1346(f) as just foreclosing an action
in State courts but not foreclosing an action in this Court*
why would you — did I correctly understand you to say that
the action would not be a 2409 action? and* if so* why wouldn°t
it be?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Because an action --

I don9t understand why you couldn't

MR»> CLAIBORNE s

- an action in which the United

States is plaintiff or intervener is not an action which is
governed by 24090
United States is

2409 is simply a waiver statute when the
neither plaintiff nor intervener.

QUESTION:

No* but supposing the United States is a

defendant* as they seek to name them? supposing we held they
could be* why couldn't it still be a 2409 action and you
still have your 12-year defense?
MR. CLAIBORNE: Well* if the Court* Mr» Justice.
Stevens* ware to hold that the United States can be sued in
this Court because 2409 has waived sovereign immunity for this
Court as well as the district court* then
QUESTION:

The only thing that prevents that is the

word "exclusive65 in 1346 {£) .

38

MR» CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION?

Indeed»

And if we construe "exclusive” as just to

exclude State court jurisdiction, aren't all the problems
solved?
MR» CLAIBORNEs

All the problems with respect to

the sovereign immunity of the United States»
QUESTIONS And also with, respect to your 12-year
defense, you still could assert that»
MR» CLAIBORNE %

And I may say that we can think of

no good reason why the government ought to be subject to suit
on its title in a district court and not in this Court»
QUESTIONi

Well, —

MR» CLAIBORNE:

Ws cannot suppose that Congress was

that solicitous of the Solicitor General»

It may have been

solicitous of this Court’s burdens, but there isn’t the
slightest indication of that in the legislative history»
We must assume that they simply overlooked that such suits
bringing into play the

title of the United States did

occasionally, when States were involved, arise originally in
this Court»
Whether this Court is free to remedy that omission
by Congress is the question»
QUESTION: But the only problem is the word "exclusive”
ih 1346(f) then?

Mr® Goodman ~ oh*

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL A® KOLSRUDP ESQ®*
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA
MR® KOLSRUDs

Yes®

Mr® Chief Justice,, and may it

please the Courts
2 would like to initially discuss a question and
answer posed by the Solicitor General which is the essence
of tills action®

And that is*

before this Court?

Must, this case be heard only

And Arizona's position iss

Mo* it must not®

I think the simplest answer to this case is to
recognise that 1346(f) can ba read as a grant of concurrent
jurisdiction by Congress to the district court* regardless of
the partieso

This has bean done* this sort of approach has

been taken prior to 1948* when the Judicial Cede stated that
eases in which a State was a party had to be brought before
the United States Supreme Court®

That posed quite a few

problems in cases where the United States brought an action
against a State* and the only jurisdiction was this Court®
There were many places* for example in the Safety
Appliance Act in U„Ss vs® California* this Court stated that
that particular legislation was actually a grant, of concurrent
jurisdiction in actions by the United States against a State*
so that the district court could in fact hear that case®

40

The same can be done right here in this action„
Any easei that is brought, any case where the United States has
title feo property that is brought by any person, the district
court should have jurisdiction to hear the case regardless of
who tie parties are®

That would be a grant of concurrent

jurisdiction and would also permit this Court to allow those
types of cases to go elsewhere®
The actual essence!, of this case is whether the
language in 1251(a)

Cl)

means exactly what it says®

It says

that jurisdiction must be exclusive in all controversies between two or more. States®
This Court*s original jurisdiction has been variously
interpreted since 1769, the date of the first Judiciary Act®
Recently this Court has implied, if not stated in dicta, that
there is an element of discretion in the interpretation of
1251(a)(I)®

Most noteworthy is the recant per curiam decision

in 1976 of Arizona against 1-Jaw Mexico®

In that case this

Court stated that it should interpret 1251(a)(1) in the same
manner that the Court would interpret Article 111, Section 2,
Clause 2 of the Constitution, which is the original jurisdic­
tion grant of power in the Constitution®
Now, if this is correct, that means that there is
some discretion in 1251(a)(1), and if that's true, than the
only question before the Court right now «—

QUESTIONS

By Stats law?

MR® KOLSRUDs

Yes*. State law®

Although that, itself,

is another issue, there are some problems that we have with
that as well®
QUESTION? Well, if the controlling law would be
State law, there certainly is another reason to have some
judges ruling on it to know something about that particular
State law, X8d suppose?
MR® XOLSRUDs

Well, yes, and the judges in the

district of California certainly handle quite a few quiet
title actions, and are quite competent to handle that sort of
a problem®

Which is one of the policy reasons under the

Constitution that a State should not have to go anywhere but
the United States Supreme Court to adjudicate whatever cases
they may have® And that, at one time, wa] 'that no other court

was competent to handle the problem®
In this instance I think the factual problems wa
have with

and this ease is primarily factual —~ can ba

adjudicated in district court®

Now, Arizona has also, we

have argued that wa can waive whatever protection there is
under 1251 (a)

CD »

Tbs analysis and the reasons for that

argument are the same as the reasons that this Court had

4?
discretion to decline to hear the case®
As a defendant, the Constitution was to protect
the idea was to protect the State from compulsory process„
The State's prestige and dignity was such that it should not
be compelled to be sued anywhere but in th© United States
Suprema Court®
Well; in this instance, what was actually meant to
foe a favor is a burden®

As a sovereign, we should be able to

submit ourselves to the jurisdiction of that court, to have
that issue decided, so long as the court has subject matter
jurisdiction? and in this ease it doss®
QUESTION*

Well, that's the problem, isn't it,

because 1251 does talk about jurisdiction?
MR® KOLSRUDs

Yes, 1251 —

QUESTION* And if it said that no district court
shall aver have jurisdiction of a suit between two States <=»=
that's really what it says, isn't it?
MR® KOLSRUDs

That's what it says®
V

QUESTION* And you wouldn't think you could consent
0,3 you can't confer jurisdiction to th© district court®
MR® KOLSRUDs

Well, we cannot confer jurisdiction,

but we think the reasons for that do not apply hare#

Plus

there's a question whether the 1251(a) Cl) actually itself
would fo&r this suit in district court®
If w® look at tli© Constitution, in Section 2, it

statas that the judicial power of the United States shall
extend to, first of all, all oases in law and equity arising
under the Constitution and statutes, and also all oases of
maritime and admiralty jurisdiction»

In other words, cases are

based upon the cause and. the subject matter*
Secondly, Article 111, Section 2 states that the
judicial power extends to controversy between two or more
States 9
And than in the next clausa, which is the grant of
original jurisdiction, the Constitution states that in all
cases in which a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court
shall have original jurisdictione

That can be read, and

reasonably read, to mean that the original jurisdic tion of
tills Court extends only to controversias between States that
involve eases, the subject matter of which are eithert
under the Constitution, involving questions of federal law?
os the other cases, marltime and admiralty*
This case doesn’t fallow that.
QUESTION? Are you familiar with the ease of Ames va
Kansas at 111 U.S. 449?
MR* KOLBRUDs
QUESTIONS

Yes*

How about the language of Chief Justice

Wait® there that the ©vident purpose of the clause you’re
referring to was to open and keep open the highest court, of
the nation for the determination in the first instance of suits

involving a State or a diplomatic or commercial representative?
MR, KOLSRUDs

That would not be inconsistent with

what X just stated* I don*t b©liove0

The idea that the Court

should be open to Ambassadors and States,, that would not be
foreclosed* it just would not be exclusive.
The exclusivity idea came from Congress in the first
Judiciary Act* -•»
QUESTION? But don81 you have to argue that Congress
was prevented from doing that by the -*» by Article III?
MR. KOLSRUDs
QUKSTIOMs

Prevent?

I'm not sure I understand»

Don’t you have to argue that

not that

Article III required Congress to make the jurisdiction
exclusive in 1251* but that it prevented it from doing it?
MR» KOLSRUDs

The Congress is prevented from making

an exclusive ■»«
QUESTIONS

Yes, By Article III.

MR» KOLSRUDs

That could be

that has bean

argued* but it's bean, rejected.
QUESTIONS Well* what is your argument that you
would make?

Perhaps I misunderstood.

MR. KOLSRUDs

My argument that I was making is that

this is not a case the subject matter of which arises under
the Constitution. Although it’s a controversy between two
States * it is not a ease that is arising under the Constitution
or the laws of the United States®

QUESTION s

it sayss

And therefore what?

QUESTION *

But. that's not — oh, excuse ma*

QUESTIONs

That’s contrary to Ames, isn't it?

Where

keep open the highest court of the nation for

determination of suits involving States»
MR» KOLSRUDs

Yes, that would «=■» it would he contrary

to Ames, to the extent that it would exclude something other
than a case arising under the Constitution»
QUESTION*

Wouldn't your argument apply to boundary

disputes?
MR* KOLSRUDs

Yes, that’s another problem with

that argument»
[Laughter»]
MRa KOLSRUDs

A boundary dispute could possibly

be argued as a case arising under the statutes of the United
Statas»

I realize that that is — hasn't been adhered to

before, but it is sort of a problem that has to be looked at
now, in this ease especially*
QUESTION*
under statutes

You say boundary disputes might arise

what, admission statutes or what?

MR* KOLSRUDs

Yes*

When Congress passed the

adminission statutes* That could be read as a case under the
statutes of the United States*
QUESTION*

Let ms test out what you just suggested

in response to a question about tine Ames case*

Suppose a

truck owned by the State of Arizona is going over into
California, as 13m sure they often do, and they run off of an
overpass and do a couple of thousand dollars9 worth of damage
to the bridge0

You can postulate any amount you wants

That's

a suit between two States, potentially, isn't it?
MR» KOLSRUDs
QUESTION*

A tort action»
Is that in this Court?

Do w® take that

damage case in tills Court, under the Constitution, as you
see it?
MR» KOLSRUDs We certainly could®

Because it would ba

a controversy between two States»
QUESTION* Well, -«
MR» KOLSRUDs

Although the action itself would be

a «*» well, under what. I postulated a moment ago it wouldn't
be, because it would not be a case arising under the
Constitution or the laws of the United States»
I realise that that argument has soma problems, but ~
QUESTION*

Well, in addressing that rather

sweeping language that seemed to embrace cases simply because
one State was claiming against another, without reference to
any federal question or question arising under the Constitution
MR» KOLSRUDs

Well, if you take the words literally,

controversies between two States, that would definitely ba a
controversy between two States»
Although that, the Constitution doesn't really say

that, either,,

The Constitution states that the judicial power

shall extend to controversy between two States, not all
controversies between two Statess

It doesn't exclude any, but

it doesn't include them all, either»
This sort of a case ought not be here.

It's a

factual case, there are not critical sovereign issues? and
that itself could be an issue, what exactly we're talking
about when vrn're talking about sovereign lands hereD California
says they arc sovereign lands»

Well, there is an argument that

the 1966 Compact had an effect on that, and it may not be»
Plus the United States is involved, and we think,
under 1346(f) that is a grant of concurrent jurisdiction at
the very leant, and if it is, then every case, not only this
one, but every ease where the controversy between two States
and the United States is defendant can go to the district
court? and that will happen quite often in this litigation»
And finally, I would like to make one more point on
this continuing jurisdiction point that California wants this
Court to take»

There is no controversy right now on the

remaining aspects of this river» The only controversy there
V

Is right now is the Davis Lake Study»

This Court has repeatedly

held that unless there is a bona fide controversy, a ease,
© wrong, some right that's susceptible of judicial determina­
tion, then this Court will not take jurisdiction of it
because it's not a justiciable — it's not justiciable under

the Constitution»
So, thank you very ranch»

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN J» GOODMAN, ESQ» ,
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
MR» GOODMANs

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court?
Arizona speaks of the possibility 'that 1346 (f) makes
1251(a)(1) a grant of concurrent rather than exclusive
jurisdiction, and talks about the pre»=1948 Judicial Code»
Wa submit that Congress's amendment of the Code of
1943 makes the plain language very clear, and that it's the
plain language that has to control here? and thatf3 the plain
language of 1251»
As Professor James Moore, the Special Consultant to
the Revisers of the 1948 Coda, stated in his treatise commentary
on the Judicial Codes-

"A large number of changes, many of

considerable importance” — interlineating here — "have been
made.

The Coda should be construed with this in mind, and

whera plain language works a change in the former law, this
change should be given effect»13

That's at page 83»

In fact, what occurred in 1948 was there was a change
in the prior law»

Prior to 1948 the statute provided for

exclusive jurisdiction where any State was a party —- this
Court in U»S» vs» California, at 297 U»S., construed that as

permitting a grant of concurrent jurisdiction to lower courts»
But Congress changed all that in 1948*
Our submission is that that change, in addition to
the reasons 1C gave during ray opening, preclude the construction
which Arisona advances»
As for whether this is an important case, we submit
that it is» These are indeed sovereign lands»
think there was any dispute about that®

We didn't

They are lands which

inured to California by virtue of its sovereignty, and to
Arisona by virtu© of its»
There's no dispute about the importance of those
lands»

Thafc!:s been clear sines Pollard's Losses vs» .Racfan»
Whether wo want to ba here or not»

W© understand

that the Court has a tremendous appellate workload, and we
read the list of eases which war© cited in a concurring
opinion recently, this tana? that we regret to say that under
our construction we have no choice« That's what Congress has

said, arid there is simply no alternative»
The issues are important for other States' as well»
The choice of law question which Hr® Justice White

raised is a very intriguing one»

Under Nebraska_ya» .Iowa,

406 0*So, it would appear that as to lands located within
each State the law of each State would apply» The question
as to the law of the »*» the boundary between federal and State
lands is particularly intriguing, because, as 'the Court knows,
