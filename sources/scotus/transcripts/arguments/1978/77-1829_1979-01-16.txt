Hew, these five issues ar© the rump contingent ©f
a veritable army of complaints about the operation-of~the MCC

R
Appeals and the Court of Appeals in turn affirmed in part and
,

'■ -I

reversed in part.

;>l

It rejected any statutory basis for the District
Court’s orders prohibiting various MCC practices and conditions
’finding that the case generally involved matters committed t©
i'i

agency discretion by law.

It accordingly rested its own rulings

solely on constitutional grounds.
And as 1 have said*, in setting forth the' constitu­
tional standards# it distinguished fo@tw@©n sentenced inmates
and pretrial detainees»

;

11
As to the former» challenged conditions were to be
judged by the Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishment
Standard.

For detainees» the Court r@Xi€3d on the presumption

of innocence to set a much higher standard.

It stated that pre­

trial detainecss may be subject to "only those restrictions and
privations which are inherent in confinement itself or which
are justified by compelling necessities of jail administration."
And it made quite clear that challenges to condi­
tions of confinement -for detainees are to be adjudicated with­
out consideration of either fiscal or administrative justifi­
cations for the particular practice.
It applied these standards for the double bunking
issue by in effect adopting a per s© rule that two inmates may
not b© hoissed in a room designed for one.
With regard fe© the other issues that are before
this Court» the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the main­
tenance of security and order is a compelling necessity of
jail administration but it nevertheless concluded that the
government had failed to establish sufficient justification for
the practices or rules in question.
Mow» as I indicated at the beginning the case breaks
down into two different types ©£ issues.

The first involves the

standards by which the due process rights of pretrial detainees
are to b© evaluated in the context of a challenge t© alleged
'overcrowding at the MCC.

12
The second involves the security-related issues.
Now, since the first issue is potentially the more
novel and substantial constitutional issue, 1 intend t© devote
most or all of my limited time to that question and to rely on
the brief's for the other issues.
I would like to say a brief word about the MCC it­
self before getting into the legal arguments.

It is one of a

very limited number of federal facilities specifically designed
to house pretrial detainees end other short term inmates.
iiv

As the Court of Appeals described it , the MCC r®-

, presented the architectural embodiment of the best and most

fi -

fprogressive penological planning.

•

The key design of the MCC

•

•

that is relevant to th© double bunking issue — and that, in-

v
i;■

;i:-

; deed, is the central element of the facility — is the modular
V; ■

>;unit concept.
In this concept there are self-contained residenC .

A typical

have doors rather than bars.

The sleeping areas

And for virtually the entire day

except seven sleeping hours between 11:00 at night and S:00 in
the morning, the inmates are free to move about their unit
without restriction.

Also, visiting facilities are attached

to each ©f these units rather than having a central facility

13
for the institution.
I understand that there are slides in the record
with photographs of the institution if you deem it useful t©
get a look at what it is like.
The MCC was designed to have 449 inmates.
contemporaneous with its

However,

opening in August, 1975 there was a

sharp and unexpected increase in the number of parsons committed
to the Bureau of Prisons custody who the Bureau determined had
to h@ or should be housed at the MCC.
Because the number of inmates exceeded the design
capacity of the institution the Bureau determined in order fe©
•meet its custodial obligations that a number of the rooms
r. :

should be used to house two inmates and that bunk beds should
replace single beds in the dormitory areas.
f>-,a •

Accordingly, bunk beds were installed in place of
&1,'

single beds in 73 of the 389 residential rooms at the MCC.
Now, the Respondents have invoked and the Court of
i: Vv
£•

;
.

Appeals has relied upon the due process clause for striking
"down the double bunking in this case.

The focus ©f the issue

ftherefore concerns the substantive content of that clause.
,1

The Court of Appeals held that the due process
clause by its own fore© and without the aid of any other const!™
fcutional provisions confers upon pretrial detainees the right
to be free of cramped housing conditions in the absence of a
governmental showing of compelling necessity —

14
QUESTION s

Is that a liberty interest or a property

MR. FREYs

I believe they viewed it as a liberty

interest?

interest.

And we do not dispute in this case that 'pretrial

detainees retain those liberty interests that are not inconsis­
tent with the fact of confinement itself.

We simply dispute

that the standard that was applied by the Court of Appeals in
evaluating the practices that are arguably impinged upon those
liberty interests was the right standard.
Now, we think that the Court of Appeals' standard
lacks any basis in the constitutional decisions of this Court
dealing with the subject of substantive du® process arid we
think that the proper resolution of the issue that was before
the Court of Appeals required that the government be afforded
the opportunity to reduce th© factors that brought about the
challenged conditions and the propriety of the government's
action having to be assessed by its reasonableness in relation
to the legitimate governmental objectives at stake.
Now, two aspects of th© constitutional backdrop t©
this issue are worth highlighting.

First, there is no dispute

that th® conditions of confinement for both pretrial detainees
and sentenced inmates must meet minimum levels of decency with
regard to such considerations as housing, food, sanitation and
medical car© and w© have spalled out in ©ur brief the reasons
for our contention that these standards have bean fully

15
satisfied at the MCC.
QUESTION?

When you say there is no dispute that

they must, do you mean constitutionally.
MR. FREY %

Constitutionally.

process clause.
QUESTION t

What does the due process clause hav®

to do with it?
MR. FREY?

Well, it has to do with it in the same

i;':sense, 1 think, that conditions of this kind can fee viewed as
cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.

W©

are in agreement that pretrial detainees cannot under the due
process clause fee punished prior t© a trial.

They cannot be punished at all, can they?

HR. FREYs

Well, after conviction, when they cease

feeing pretrial detainees.

I know but you said pretrial detainees.

MR. FREY %

They cannot b© punished.

At. all.

That is

correct.
Not only cruelly and unusually

punished, they cannot fee punished at all, asm. they?

you say

MR. FSEYs

That is true but --

QUESTION:

Arid that is a matter of due process,

16
MR» FREY:

Yes, we agree.

QUESTION:

What is the standard?

Could you suggest

one that if we were to conclude that a particular typ® of treat”
went really had to be classified as punishment then that would
violate the due process clause.

It did not have to be cruel

and unusual but just as long as it is punishment.
MR. FREY %

if you concluded that it was punishment

then it would violate the due process clause.
Now, we have a groat deal of difficulty with the
Respondents' argument that what was involved in this case was
demonstrated to b@ punishment.

We think the concept ©£ punish­

ment is there, using it as a trivial or tautological concept,
it is punishment because they repeatedly say it is punishment

to comply with the District Court's order.

They have-been in

compliance for two years without a single request for a stay,
' without returning to the courts for relief from 'the order pro­
hibiting double bunking —
QUESTION:

" *4

How d© you define overcrowding,

Mrs. Bamberger?
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Okay, we define it for purposes

©£ this eas®, as the District Court sought and as he made
findings.

We have two people housed in a cell which the judge

found was built for ©n@.
The results ©f this housing ©£ few© people in a cell
' built for ©a® was that there was a very small spas® for movenuant of feh® 'few© people.

He looked at it @ad h@ saw there was a

25
very narrow aisle.
Secondly, it requires urination and defecation in
the close presence of the other person with the resulting dis­
comforts which the judge described in his opinion.
QUESTION:

Well, I do not mean to be anecdotal but

the troopship I came back on in the Second World War had bunks
stacked six-high in the hold of a ship and I do not think the
common viev.’ then was that it was a form of punishment or that
it was necessarily overcrowding, given the circumstances.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that is

a point which can be easily explained.

The Government's com-

■ pelling interest in wartime is far different from

the Govern­

ment's compelling interest as it exists with the detention of
presumptively innocent detainees.
The purpose of the wartime confinement was to create
; ®

fighting unit which could defend the Government — which

to?.

’ could defend this country.
QUESTION:

But in military camps today when we are

in no war you will find a considerable amount of double bunking.
MRS. BAMBERGER:

Indeed, Your Honor and the condi­

tions of confinement in a. military camp, even in normal times,
can be justified by the Government because of the Government's
need to create a unified fighting force, capable of taking
orders and directions and indeed, in wartime conditions living
under very severe restrictions and conditions.

26

That is not true here.

The Government's compelling

interest is limited to making sure that the individual shows
up for court and for protecting the security of the institution
and the Government does not claim and, indeed, it never has,
that overcrowding by double bunking in this case is justified
by anything other than cost and convenience.

Thank you, Mrs. Bamberger.

Mr. Frey, you have about five minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT 0F ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
MR. FlEYs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

49
First of all, with regard to the testimony of
Government experts in other cases about the amount ©f spae© that
is necessary, the other case was a ease that involved a call
in which people were locked for substantial portions of the
day.

It is central to the concept of the MCC and it bears

repeating that people are not locked into their rooms except
during sleeping hours' so the inconveniences that w© are talking
about in this case of two people being in cramped quarters —
and we do not deny that the quarters are cramped ~ is an in­
convenience in terns ©f forced togetherness that exists for a
period, a relatively brief period and in fact essentially none
©f the waking hours except whan there are certain times when
everybody has to go to 'their rooms for a call count.
Now, there was no hearing in this case, not only
1 t© hear the Government8s justification for resorting to double
! bunking but also no hearing to examine the effect ©f do^sfol®
bunking ©n the inmates.
The only evident® that was fe©i@r<t the District
'"'Court in this ease was the affidavit ©S the Government psyehia"
triisfc who had ©ssasaisied the facilities and who concluded that
th@r© was no substantial evidence that this wm ©ffiotiomally

--

50
The other case in which they already settled it —
and the Coart of Appeals made a repealing error in their ©ri' ginal opinion at page 18a of the Appendix.
They stated, *Inmate testimony revealed that doublecelling had produced numerous disagreements over the choice of

U-:

'

One thing that is very important, y©ia asked why are
we inquiring into fiscal and adminsitrative reasons for the

Nobody in the lower courts has based any de­

cision on the grounds of what happened her® was punishment»
That was not the basis ©f the decision.

That is feh© argument of th© Respondent in any effort
to surmount th© lack of authority t© support the Court of

appropriate to judge th® restriction ©a th© liberty of th© in­
mates that was involved®
Th© Court of Appeals did not say this was punishment.
Now, they say it was punishment but they d© not
analyse th© concept in th® way this Court has analyzed it.
That is, they do not look to th© standards in Msndoza«Martinos,

QUESTIONS

If is your submission that unless or

until there is a finding that this amounts to punishment, th©

MR. FREY:

Wall, our argument is that unless or

until there is a finding that there is a lack of•a reasonable
relationship under whatever level of judicial scrutiny might
b© given to felt® Government's justification between the practice
of double bunking and legitimate Governmental objective that
might support that practice, fete© practice stands.

accept the theory suggested in my question.

You think that it

violates th® due process clause even if it is not punishment.
