PROCEEDINGS

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Washington and others against Washington
State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association and the
consolidated cases.
Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER STATE OF WASHINGTON
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Claiborne has just delivered to the Clerk a
large set of maps of the case area which may aid in your under­
standing of this argument, and to which we have no objection.
The central issue in this litigation, the issue to
which every other question is subsidiary, is the meaning of
the phrase, and I quote, "In common with all citizens," found
in each of the treaties with which v;e are concerned.
Very little of the record and only a few paragraphs
of the original District Court decision are relevant to this
central issue.
The answer to the subsidiary questions is relatively
easy, once this Court construes the "in common with" language.
But, without a decision on that point, answering the other
questions is unlikely to resolve the controversy.

4
The United States and the tribes seek to fragment
the controversy and delay its ultimate resolutioni
QUESTION;

What if we thought the question had

already been answered and it wasn't open here?
MR* GORTON;

If you felt that the question had

already been answered or that it were final in some respect or
another* we would not be able to bring it here in this liti­
gation.
QUESTION:

I take it, you are going to indicate

why you think it is open here.
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

The United States says it may

The crux of our position is

MR. GORTON:

MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

The entire phrase speaks of fish

The right of taking fish.
The right of taking fish, usual and

accustomed stations and in common with the citizens of the
territory.
QUESTION:

The District Court, in its original

5
opinion and the Court of Appeals in its original affirmance
thought that the phrase "in common with all citizens of the
territory" was the key and critical phrase, but it may not be.
MR. GORTON:

Exactly.

The crux of our position here,

Mr. Justice Stewart, is that the District Court's decision
mandating a

allocation of anadromous fish to treaty Indians

is without support, either in that treaty language or in the
circumstances surrounding the execution of the treaties.
Our view is that the treaty language secured for the
Indians the right to participate in a common fishery from which
they might otherwise have been exoluded,

In other words, the

treaties guaranteed in perpetuity an equal opportunity fishery.
But before discussing that discussion of the treaties,
let's reflect for a moment on the actual impact of an equal
opportunity fishery on Indians, should that be your holding.
Would such a holding deprive treaty Indian fishermen of a
reasonable participation in the fishery?
Not at all.

The contrary.

In an equal opportunity

fishery, Indian participation will continue to be substantial,
out of all proportion to their share of the population of the
Puget Sound region.

In fact, the percentage of all commercial

fishermen who are Indians is likely to continue to increase,
and for a number of reasons.
First, the states began to limit the number of
licenses to engage in salmon fishing five years ago.

That

6
program has resulted in a reduction in the number of nonIndian commercial fishing licenses,
Indians

,

on the other hand* are not required to

obtain state licenses,

Indians, in addition to that, are not

required to pay for those licenses.
Thus, the major limitation -QUESTION:

How about season limitations and catch

limits on Indians?
MR. GORTON:

That's the crux of the oase, as to

whether or not that type of regulation can be imposed on
Indians equally with others.
require licenses.

It is clear that they do not

So the major limitation on the number of

treaty Indian fishermen at this point, leaving aside their
catch, is their own interest in the business,
Second, Indians are not subject to the financial
burdens of either state licence fees or landing ta:res.

They

are, nevertheless, the beneficiaries of the hatchery programs
which are financed by those taxes.
Third, the Indian capability to fish competitively
has been increased greatly by federal and tribal financial
assistance In the purchase of sophisticated boats and gear.
At the same time, the state has been buying up and
retiring non-Indian boats and licenses.

The state has also

assisted Indian hatchery operations and fish farming enter­
prises

7
Fourth — and we get to the treaty at this point —
the District Court has determined the -- and I quote from the
treaty — "usual and accustomed grounds and stations

of the

Indians are not restricted to small areas near the reservations.''
For one tribe or another, those grounds include all of Puget
Sound, as we have there on that map, all of the United States*
portion of the Strait cf Juan de Fuca and the State's portion
of the Pacific Ocean two-thirds of the way down the coast.
In summary, they include all of the state's marine
watei^ in the case area, together with portions of the Pacific
Ocean beyond the state’s jurisdiction,

Every mile of water

shown on that map in the United States is a part of the usual
and accustomed grounds of some Indian tribe under the District
Court's decision.

And we do not object to that characteriza­

tion.
The District Court, as its rationale for the 50$"
plus allocation, extracted a part of an 1855 dictionary defini­
tion of the word "caramon."
abandoned.

That rationale has long since been

The Ninth Circuit and the Respondents have con­

tinued to search unsuccessfully for a rationale on which they
could agree and which will support that rigid allocation.
Most of their substitutes, and the original decision itself
rest on the characterization of the fishing right as tribal
rather than as individual.

But all references to treaty

fishing rights,in every treaty save one, secure those rights

8
specifically to individuals.

While the other articles of the

treaties refer to and deal with the tribes as entities.
Governor Stevens, of course, included the "in common
with" language — as a matter of fact, all of the fishery
language — in treaty drafts which he presented to the
tribes.

He explained the provision as expressing his view,

and we quote from some of the treaty minutes:

"He wanted them

to fish, but the whites should fish also."
That treaty language, thus explained, is apparently
the source of the equal protection guarantees for individuals
found to be implicit in the treaties by this Court in
Puyallup I and Puyallup IX.
The treaties do, of course,! secure certain rights to
the Indians not possessed by other citizens.

They are con­

tained largely in that Usual and Accustomed Grounds and
Stations Clause.
A Mr. Simmons, an Indian agent present at the negoti­
ations, explained to the Indians that — and again I quote the
minutes --- "The privilege was given of going wherever they
pleased to fish."
And this Court, in its first decision on the treaties,
Wlnans in 1205, distinguished clearly between the right to fish,
which the Court characterized, and I quote, "as a mere right,
not exclusive.,and which citizens might share," from what this
Court called the "special means for its exercise."

9
The special right Is the right of access»

The state

can regulate the right to fish, under circumstances which you
have set down, but it may not exercise the right of access.
Excuse me, regulate the right of access.
The fallacy of the 50#-plus allocation is, perhaps,
; *,

•

***&■;

most graphically illustrated by its own logical result.

There

were five treaties affecting the Puget Sound fishery, not one.
There were scores of quasi-sovereign Indian bands on Puget
Sound whom Governor Stevens consolidated for treaty purposes.
But if the treaties mandate a 50#-plus allocation to all, the
single treaty with the Makahs, the tribe located where the
Strait of Juan de Puca meets the Pacific Ocean, would guarantee
that tribe a 50#~plus allocation of the fish passing through
their grounds.
Next, the grounds of the tribes which signed the
Treaty of Point No Point, at the point where Puget Sound meets
the Strait of Juan de Puca, span the entrance to Lower Puget
Sound totally.

They would thus be authorized to take 50# of

all of the salmon which could escape the Makahs, cutting in
half all runs destined for the grounds of the Indian benefici­
aries of three more treaties farther south on the Sound,
By the time the few remaining fish reach the last in
line, the Yakimas, theirs is an entitlement to 50# of almost
nothing.

And if non-Indians take their 50# at Point no Point,

the Lower Sound tribes would have literally nothing.

io

After all, if the Indians are entitled to have a
$0$ return of fish to their normal and accustomed grounds, the
articles in the treaty which give them exclusive fishing rights
on their reservation, must guarantee a 100$ return of fish to
those reservations and, thus, leave nothing for anyone else.
Clearly, the treaties don’t mandate a 50$-plus allo­
cation.

But what do the treaties mean in that case?

Their

language Implies an equal opportunity fishery, by the "in
common with” language, with special Indian rights of access.
So did Governor Stevens' explanation to the Indians.
So does your finding of implications of equal pro­
tection in the Puyallup series.
But there is more.

Let's look at the jurisdictional

status of Puget Sound in the years surrounding 1850* before
the treaties were signed.

United States sovereignty over what

is now Washington State was perfected by an 1846 treaty with
Great Britain.

That sovereignty brought v/ith it the Common Law

and the Statutes of the United States.

That Common Law, in

turn, included the concept of a common fishery for the benefit
of all, except as expressly limited by statute.
So, American citizens had the right to fish in Puget
Sound before the execution of the Indian Treaty.

The record

reveals that they did fish In Puget Sound then.

The treaties

didn't create that right.
QUESTION:

When you say they had a right, was it a

11

different right from the right of the Indians?
MR. GORTON:

No, it was the same right.

point., everyone shared a common fishery,

At that

What the treaties

secured for the Indians was the continuation of that right
free from interference by the Territorial Legislature, which
might very well have passed a law saying the common fishery
is for citizens only.

Without treaties and without citizenship,

the Indians could have been excluded from that fishery by the
Territorial Legislature or by private action.
And the tribes admit as much themselves.

On. page

248 of their brief, they state the obvious, and I quote from
that brief:

"Indian fishermen who are not members of treaty

tribes enjoy no special rights; their fishing is subject to
the same limitations placed on all non-Indian fishermen."
Now, why do non-treaty Indians enjoy no special
rights?

If Indians brought exclusive fishing rights to the

treaty negotiations and merely relinquished a portion of those
rights, non-treaty Indians would still have exclusive rights
at their usual and accustomed places today.
But this Court has already affirmed a decision which
is consistent tirifch that concession in the tribal brief.
QUESTION:

General Gorton, in that connection,

Article III refers to "said Indians."
MR. GORTON:

What does "said" mean?

"Said" refers to Indians who are

members of the tribes which signed that particular treaty.

12
You will note the structure of the treaty in the Articles and
the different verbs which — the different phrases which are
used.

In the beginning of the treaty, the Indians grant their

claims to lands to the United States.
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

The Indians or the tribes do?
The tribesp and they are spoken of as

tribes.
QUESTION:
MR, GORTON:

That'S what I thought.
There is reserved to the tribes,out of

those grants,land as reservations.

But what about fisheries?

There is secured to sold Indians the right to fish at their
usual and accustomed stations in common with the citizens of
the territory.
QUESTION:

And what do you think "said Indians"

means?
MR, GORTON:

It moans the Indians, as individuals,

who were members of the tribes which signed the treaty,
just as "citizens" referred to citizens w’ho were part of the
corporate body of the United States itself,
QUESTION:

Genera^ Gorton, does the state take any

position as to whether the treaty was or was not self-executing?
MR, GORTON:

The state has not taken an explicit

position on that treaty.

I think it relates to whether or not

you can order the State Department of Fisheries to carry out
the mandate of the treaty, or whether or not that depends on

13
state legislative authorization.

Since we feel and v/ill say

that the state courts would acknowledge that state legislation
now gives to the Department of Fisheries the right to manage
the fishery consistently with the treaties* it —
QUESTION:

Well, ordinarily, a non-self-executing

treaty requires legislation by Congress, not by the state.
MR. GORTON:

I was directing it, however, at the

right of the state agency to enforce those treaty obligations
as you may interpret them.

From the point of view of securing

or guaranteeing the rights outlined in the treaty, we would
agree that the treaties are self-executing.

They did not

require legislation by Congress.
QUESTION:

What in 1979 "said" means?

"Said"

Indians.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

Exactly what it meant in 1854.
No, because those people are all dead.
The successors, their decendants.
Present tribal members or any decendants

of people that were tribal members in 1955?

There is a

difference.
MR. GORTON:

The complexity of who is a tribal

member is turgid and perhaps too difficult for me to go
into because the Indian tribes, by and large, set their own
membership.

And people are often granted membership in various

tribes who have an extremely tenuous blood relationship with

14
the Indians who signed the original treaty.
QUESTION:

I was wondering about the concession that

you quoted to us on the part of the tribes who said that
Indians, generally, didn't have any treaty rights at all,
unless they were present tribal members.
MR. GORTON:

Not unless they were present tribal

members, unless they were members of treaty tribes.
QUESTION:

Yes, present members of treaty tribes.

And I wondered whence that concession.
MR. GORTON:

The concession simply recognizes the

fact that the special rights of treaty tribes stem from the
treaty and not from something preceding the treaty,
QUESTION;

Your submission is it is not the rights

of the treaty tribes, at least under Article III, it is the
rights of Indians, individual Indians; isn’t it?
MR. GORTON:

Yes, but by reason of their status,

by reason of their membership in certain tribes.
QUESTION:

And in 1979> what status?

Direct decen-

dants of those who were tribal members, or. present tribal
members?
MR, 'GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Members of the tribes.
Present members of the treaty tribes?
Present members of the treaty tribes.

There might conceivably some day be a contest as to whether or
not a particular Indian was properly a member of the tribe, but

15
that contest has not yet taken place.
QUESTION:

But If his great grandfather was a

member of the tribe and he now works in a filling station in
Seattle he has no rights under the treaty?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Oh, yes, he does.
But he Is not now a member of the tribe?
Yes, he is.
Well, let's assume he resigned.
Then he vjould lose those rights.

is not much reason for him to resign.

There

But only if he took

himself affirmatively out of the tribe would he find himself
in that status.

Many of these treaty Indians do live off the

reservation and in cities, perhaps the majority of them.
The court recognized this distinction between treaty
and non-treaty Indians in U, S, v. McGowan, in a long opinion
in 2 F. Supp. 426 in 1932, which was simply affirmed by this
Court without opinion In 294 U.S. 592.
Now, I don't use this line of reasoning of the
status of the non-Indian in 1850 as conclusive proof of our
construction of the "in common with" language in the treaties.
The language itself, Governor Stevens' explanation of it and
your Puyallup decisions, it seems to me, lead to that conclu­
sion .
That line of reasoning, based on concepts of sover­
eignty and what actually was the situation in the mid~19fch

16

Century argues very powerfully that the United States, whose
citizens possessed the right to a common fishery in 1850 and
which planned for vast Increases in the non-Indian population
by the very treaty negoiations themselves, did not casually
treat away in perpetuity more than half of the fishery resource.
how would come the logical question.

Even if the

50^-plus allocation is not required by the treaty, isn't the
lesson of your three Puyallup decisions that some specific
allocation 5.s required?
Our answer to that is no.

And the distinctions

between this case and Puyallup are vital.
dealt with a discriminatory fishery.

The Puyallup cases

That is one which you

have characterized as totally preempted by non-Indians,

To

justify such a discriminatory fishery, if it could be clone at
all, the state at least had to prove that its system was absol­
utely necessary to conservation,
QUESTION:

You are referring to a fishery as a com­

mercial fishery?
MR. .GORTON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
In that case, there was no commercial

fishing allowed.
MR, GORTON:

The entire fishery was preempted by

non-Indians by your decision in Puyallup.
QUESTION;
prohibited

But commercial fishing was absolutely

IT
MR. GORTON:
barred.

Commercial fishing was absolutely

No one could engage in a commercial fishery.
Since we could not prove that that regulatory

system was absolutely necessary for conservation, it fell.
After Puyallup II, however, it seems that the state had two
possible courses of action, not one, either an equal opportunity
net fishery, commercial fishery, for everyone, or an allocation
between treaty net fishermen and non-treaty sport fishermen.
The state chose the latter and you approved It in
Puyallup III, and permitted the

tate even to regulate an on-

reservation fishery to see that the non-Indians got their
allocation.
But the Marine Water —
QUESTION:

These cases involved — at least Puyallup

And this case in­

volves, primarily at least, commercial fishing for salmon,
MR. GORTON:

That's exactly right.

And there Is,

in addition, a major distinction between those two.
head can only be caught in fresh water.

Steel-

By the time fish get

to fresh water, conservation policies — It is very simple.
The only conceivable conservation policy is one which will get
enough fish upstream to spawn.

When one is dealing with a

marine salmon fishery, however, conservation has necessarily
got to be a much broader concept.
If you will look at the map on page 3^3 in the Joint

18

Appendix, which is referred to in a brief of the tribe, you
will note major areas in Puget Sound denominated "Salmon
preserves*'1

The tribes characterize those as areas which are

permanently closed to commercial fishing.

That is an error as

far as the South Sound preserves are concerned.

There are

frequent commercial fisheries there.
It is a perfect characterization along the shores of
the Strait of Juan de Fuca in what are called Areas 1 and 2.
No commercial fishing for salmon is permitted there but a sport
fishery is.

That brings those areas precisely into your

Puyallup II situation, since they are usual and accustomed
grounds and stations.
We simply cannot ban entirely a commercial fishery
there and the District Court has permitted Indian fisheries
there.

But the state can permit non-Indian fisheries there.

If conservation is the only way that we can control the
fishery and if conservation is only letting enough fish
escape to spawn* inevitably the whole commercial fishery is
going to get driven out there, so that both sides can get
their share.

Because it can't be closed down as to non-Indians

until you've gotten down to just the number of fish necessary
for escapement,
Bo conservation in a marine area, in the commercial
field, has got to include something else than pure escapement
for spawning.

It's got to include a concept of optimum yield

19

and of a fair distribution of the fishery among all types of
fishermen, Indians and non-Indians, Purse Seiners, Gillnetters
and the like.
Every one of your cases in which you have used the
word ’’conservation," six straight eases, from Winans to
Puyallup III, have all dealt with fresh water fisheries.

This

is the first time you are dealing with a marine salt water
fishery.
QUESTION:

Is there any fresh water fishing involved

in this case at all?
MR. GORTON:

Yes.

These usual and accustomed

grounds and stations go up the stream to their very sources,
but the principal focus of the case is on the salt water
marine fishery.
QUESTION:

There is no indication on this map or

any other map of these usual accustomed grounds and stations?
MR, GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

They are everything.
But you said some are upstream.
That's right,

These maps do not show

the upstream, the fresh water usual and accustomed grounds.
They do show — because all of the salt water are usual and
accustomed grounds of one tribe or another.
QUESTION:

The salmon deteriorate in quality as they

go upstream, don't they?
MR. GORTON:

Most of them do, yes.

By the time

20
they've got to the spawning beds, they are much less valuable
than they are further downstream.
QUESTION:

There is commercial fishing of them by

the Indians?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

By the Indians, not by non-Indians.
In fresh water?
Yes.
And that is involved in this case?
Yes.
And their right to fish at those accus­

tomed grounds and stations might be very ephemeral, if there
were no fish there?
MR. GORTON:

Pardon?

Which would be ephemera], if

no fish ’were there?
QUESTION:

What does the right to fish mean?

I know

when X go fishing nobody gives me the right to catch fish.
MR, GORTON:

That is exactly right.

And the logical

answer to that is, if the Indians have a usual and accustomed
right to fish where they historically fished, at the very top
of the stream, there must be an allocation.

It is clearly

required.
It is, however, not only terrible management policy,
but has also been abandoned by this Court as long ago as
Wlnans and even by the way the United States manages its
marine fisheries9 for this reason:

21

One of those upstream usual and accustomed grounds
and stations may well have only a single run with a few hundred
fish coming back to it.

But in marine waters, that run is

mixed with many other runs, with hundreds of thousands of fish.
If the state has got to return those salmon — plans
to return that single run of salmon to that single upstream
usual and accustomed grounds and place, there xvill be a tremen­
dous wastage of fish in all of the marine water area.
Consequently, the District Court, itself, has found
marine usual and accustomed grounds and stations for almost
all the treaty Indians.

One of the treaty groups of tribes,

Point no Point, has new petitioned that the usual and accus­
tomed grounds of each of these tribes are the usual and ac­
customed grounds of all of them.
We don’t object to that.

That's good fishery

management .
In Winans, you dealt with an exclusive right of
access, but also there is a cryptic note in that decision.
There was a non-Indian flshwheel at a usual and accustomed —

through.

MR. GORTON:

Some sort of trap?
Yes.

It catches every fish that goes

22

It was on privately-owned land on an Indian station,
6to in dealing with the right to fish, as opposed to the right
to access, this Court says in Vlinans:

"The Solicitor General

points the way,"
We quote, at pages 85 and 86 of our opening brief,
the way which the Solicitor General pointed.

He said the

Indians could be given more advantageous places, or advantag­
eous places, upstream or downstream from that fishwheel.
This is what the United States does.

It manages its

ocean fishery primarily for non-Indians, and then says that
the state must cut down non-Indian fishing in Puget Sound to
account for all of the fish which Washington citizens have
$

taken under federal licences in the open ocean.
And that's the reason for the great disparity in
the Puget Sound allocations to Indians and non-Indians.

So

everyone really manages in the way of making that right at
usual and accustomed stations real by a proper management of
the fish and pushing the fishery out into marine waters or
further downstream.
It can't be over-emphasized here that the District
Court found a permanent and immutable right.

It did not

fashion a remedy for alleged discrimination.

The tribes and

their amici have attempted to characterize this as a discrimin
ation case and to disguise the 50$-plus allocation as a remedy
Perhaps the best illustration that that's not the

23

case is the IPPSC Fishery* the straits fishery and Canadian
fish.

That fishery* on Canadian bound salmon, occurs in the

Strait of Juan de Fuca in the Northern Puget Sound in the usual
and accustomed grounds of fewer than one-third of the tribes
who are parties to this litigation.

There is no significant

non-Indian harvest before the fish reach those usual and ac­
customed grounds.
Even so* the District Court found that those eight
tribes were entitled to 50J& of the catch,

A right, not a

remedy.
We feel that the judgment should be reversed and
remanded for a determination as to whether or not an equal
opportunity fishery exists now or,if not, how the state can
assure it,

reason that an issue is open whenever you have denied certiorari
in earlier proceedings in the same case, and later accept
certiorari in connection with later orders in the same case
involving the same parties.
QUESTION:

So it is open as a matter of res judicata,

but the Government doesn't rely on the — the Solicitor General
doesn't rely on res judicata, but rather on more prudential--

24

MR. GORTON:

The Solicitor General tells you that

you should not judge this case on the merits because we are
bad people, is essentially what it amounts to.

It is rather

like a father who leaves his wallet on his dresser and finds
$20 missing the next morning and accuses his son of stealing
it.

The son curses and spits at him and the father later

finds the $20 in his pocket.
Obviously, the son can be punished for contempt, but
Mr, Claiborne would have you say that the father should not
apologise for being wrong in connection with the $20 in the
first place,
QUESTION:

Well, in this case, who is the father

and who is the son?
MR. GORTON:

Exactly.

Thank you, very much.

I will reserve the balance of

my time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lacovara.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS PUGET SOUND GXLLNETTERS ASSOC., ST AL.
MR. LACOVARA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case, as the Attorney General, has emphasized,
involves the question whether or not one group of commercial
fishermen, Indians in this case, is entitled to a courtawarded perpetual guarantee of a competitive preference over

25
non-Indian competitors.
The Attorney General has indicated that that result
is wrong and we strongly support that aspect of the State's
position,
Since my time, this morning, is brief, I must neces­
sarily rely on the briefs that I have submitted, the salmoncolored opening brief and the yellow reply which discussed not
only the substantive points, the historical points, questions
of collateral treaties, but also some of the procedural ob­
stacles that the United States and the tribes have attempted
to erect in order to prevent this Court from resolving what
everyone conceives of as an extremely important -- legally,
practically, emotionally, culturally, politically — question
that has been plaguing the Northwest and will continue to
plague the Northwest unless it is definitively set to rest
by this Court.
There are four major concepts that I would like to
emphasize this morning, and they all grow out of the same
flaw that the Federal Courts below have manifested in the
results that they have reached.

And the flaw is a failure to

recognize and fully appreciate the significance of the fact
that non-Indian commercial fishermen also have rights which
a Federal Court of equity must respect here.
There has been no recognition, no appreciation and
no implementation of those rights of the non-Indian commercial

26

fisherman.
The first point is that the treaties protect to the
non-Indian commercial fisherman a right of access to this
fishery as well as a protection of the Indian's right of
access to the fishery.

This was to be a non-exclusive fishery

from which neither Indians nor non-Indians could be excluded
by the other group.
And secondly —
QUESTION:

Would it be your theory, Mr. Lacovara,

that in that treaty the United States, as one party, was the
surrogate for all other than Indians?
MR. LACOVARA :

In thci treaty, it was guaranteeing

the rights, the continued fishing rights of the citizens of
the territory, now the citizens of the State of Washington,
and the treaty so says.
The language of Article III of the treaties secures
the rights of Indians in common with the right of the citizens
of the Territory.
I think nothing could be more clear from the text of
the treaties, as well as from the history of the negotiations,
that there was to be a bilateral commitment that treatyIndians and non-treaty citizens would have continuing access
to these fisheries.
QUESTION:

Is it your submission, Mr* Lacovara,

that Article III doesn't give to Indians any superior or

27

special rights whatsoever?
MR. LACOVARA:

It gives them superior rights only

to the extent that the Court in Wloans, for example, has said
the state cannot legitimize a complete exclusion of Indians
from the fishery through the medium of private ownership of
the lands.

What the treaties were to guarantee to the Indians

was a right of access that they would not otherwise have had
*

in 1855«
QUESTION:

It gives them sort of an implied easement

over private property to get to these places, doesn't it?
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

VJinans so held.

Which citizens would not have?

MR. LACOVARA:

Which citizens would not have,

that's right.
In Tulee, for example* the Court said Indians under
the treaty are also immune from licensing regulations, also
a protection that citizens would not have.
QUESTION:

So you concede that Indians are given

superior and different and other rights than citizens by
Article III, don't you?
MR. LACOVARA:

No.

I think the point, Mr. Justice

Stewart, is that the Indians have certain protections as
against state abrogation or interference with those rights.
QUESTION:

Which citizens don't have.

MR. LACOVARA:

That is correct

28

QUESTION:

So., Indians do have superior rights and

different rights.
MR. LACOVARA :

As against the state.

Certainly the right that the Indians obtained under
the treaty can be qualified by federal legislation.
The question, though, is whether or not the right
of access which Indians are to be given is one that can be
turned from a shield, if you will, against state Interference
into a sword which allows the Indians to demand that the state
keep non-Indians from fishing side by side?
That, we submit, is exactly what these treaties were
not intended to do and the documents that bear on this span
only a few pages in the records and every one demonstrates
that the Indians were being told that, with respect to offreservation fishing, they could not interfere with the settlers'
equal opportunity to fish,
QUESTION:
that the right

At the very least, Article III makes clear

secured or reserved to the Indians is net an

exclusive right.
MR* LAC OVA RA :

Yes, sir.

And that is one of the linchpins of our submission,
that what Judge Bolt has done in this case is fundamentally
erroneous, because as the orders that he has subsequently
entered have achieved, the Indians have successfully insisted
that the non-treaty fishermen stay on the beach and watch them

29
from the shore while the Indians have, in effect, a courtdecreed oligopoly, an exclusive preserve in trying to catch
these fish for commercial purposes.
There is absolutely nothing in the treaties or the
history of their negotiations to support that kind of exclusiv
ity of the fishery.
QUESTION:

I suppose you would say that the state

might be able to cancel all commercial fishing for salmon for
several years, but not Indians?
MR. LftCOVARA:

If it were acting for conservation

purposes, it would have the power,
QUESTION:

Say it is not.

MR. LAC OVA RA :

I am not sure what other aspect of

the police power the state would be relying on, just willynilly to cancel commercial salmon harvesting, unless It were
to be the conservation power.
QUESTION:

You still don't meet my question.

Assume it couldj it couldn't do It with the Indians
under the treaty?
MR. LACOVARA:

That is correct.

But if the state has the power to eliminate non­
commercial fishing for non-conservation purposes, the Court's
decisions in Ulna ns, Tu3.ee and Puyallup indicate the state
cannot do that for Indians.
QUESTION:

There is another one, Mr. Lacovara, down

30

in Virginia,

They stopped fishing because of the poison*

remember?
MK, LACGVARA :

I would assume that the state would

have that power, even ns respects Indians* but that extra­
ordinary —
QUESTION:

At the same level as what you. said before.

MR. LACOVARA :

Yes* that kind of ex trad'd inary

development* I think* would give rise to police power* in
the same sense that the Court held that there was an implied
police power even as respects Indians under these treaties.
The second point is that when conservation becomes
necessary that conservation can lawfully be imposed.

Regula­

tions of that sort can lawfully be imposed upon the treaty
Indians* as long as it is done without discrimination against
them.

But* by the same token, there is nothing in these

treaties or in this Court’s earlier cases to indicate that
conservation regulations must be skewed so that they* in effect,
discriminato against the non-Indians.

That, however* is the

effect of the preferential rights that the District Court
tolerated, on one theory or another,whi'c’h two very dubious
circuit judges this last time around have, in effect* allowed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lacovar, isn’t it inevitable that

there is some-discrimination against non-Indians?
example* the Indians don’t have to get licenses.
isn't that part of — something we start from.

For
I mean

And the

31

question is how much discrimination, not whether there is
any at all,
MR, LACOVAR:

Mr, Justice Stevens, it is not so

much how much discrimination, but what type that is at issue
here.
QUESTION:

But don’t you agree that there is sort

of a given that we start with?

There is some discrimination

in favor of the Indians by virtue of the treaties.
MR. LACOVAR:

Yes.

There is no doubt, as to some

aspects of treaty fishing, there are special benefits that
were secured.

What we are' coming toy though, is whether or

not —
QUESTION:

There also is some discrimination against

the Indians.
MR. LACOVAR:
QUESTION:

I think not.

Well, they took their land.

MR. LACOVAR:

They didn’t take it, Mr. Justice.

If you read the full text of the treaties, you will find that
in addition to these guarantees these tribes were paid what,
in contemporary terms, would be considered many millions of
dollars to extinguish claims of occupancy.

And they were

guaranteed and were provided 'with schools, doctors, black­
smiths, carpenters and farmers to teach them other trades
other than fishing.
So, I think it would not be accurate to view these

32

treaties, in 1979* as a one-sided adhesion contract which
the Indians had no choice about.
QUESTION:

I don't think you need to say that it

discriminated on either side.
MR. LACOVAR:

Well, what we are trying to do,

Mr. Justice, is to eliminate discrimination which is in­
herent, and this is my third point, in a 50-50 allocation.
The District Courts below did not find that there
was discrimination against Indian fishing in the Puyallup
sense.

The only reference to discrimination in Judge Bolt's

findings was the question-begging

assertion that there was

discrimination against Indians because the state conservation
regulations did not actually permit them to catch 50$ of the
harvest.
That's the issue before us, whether or not the
Indians are entitled to that.

Our submission is that there

is not anything of that sort happening here.

The Attorney

General referred, for example, to the Frazier River run of
salmon, for which it is impossible to conceive of any kind of
discrimination, because the Indians have and have always had
contemporaneous access to those runs alongside the non-Indian
fisherman.
So, it is impossible to talk about the state or
non-Indian fishermen preempting the run and discriminating
against Indian rights.

33
QUESTION:

Mr» Lacovar, let's consider for a moment

these upstream accustomed places and stations.

Article III

gives the Indians the right of taking fish there.

VJould you

concede that if the State of Washington or any other government
should, through.its licensing and supervision of fishing,
adopt such rules and regulations that would assure that there
xuere no fish there, that that would be a violation of the
treaty?
MR, LACOVAR:

Mr. Justice, I think the key inquiry

should be as it was in Puyallup II, whether or not the rights
of those Indians, or the successors —
QUESTION:

The right to take fish.

MR. LACOVAR:

The right to take fish at usual and

accustomed grounds, not necessarily each specific grounds.

And

the findings by the District Court in this case establish —
QUESTION:

If you add up each specific ground,

you come to all of them.
MR. LACOVAR:

Yes, but the judge also found that

at treaty time there were ebbs and flows of runs and it was
common for the Indians to follow the fish and to abandon,
temporarily if necessary, perhaps permanently, a usual and
accustomed site and go elsewhere if that's where the fish
were.
QUESTION:
question

Well, that doesn’t quite answer my

34
MR. LACOVAR:

Well, what I am suggesting is that

there is no discrimination against Indians —
QUESTION:

No, no, I am talking about if there Is

a treaty violation if the State of Washington so operates its
conservation rules and regulations as to guarantee that there
are no fish at these upstream stations and grounds.
MR. LACOVAR:

My answer would be that there is no

treaty violation unless —
QUESTION:

Because there is a right of taking fish

there guaranteed to the Indians by Article III.
MR. LAC OVA RA :

To the extent that fish are there*

and there was no guarantee —
QUESTION:

Doesn’t that imply some kind of duty to

allocate or to see to it that there are some fish there?
MR. LAC OVA RA:

I don't think it does, Mr. Justice,

but we are a long way from that.' There is nothing in the
treaties that guaranteed that the fish would continue to migrate
all the way upstream.

I think we could go as far as saying

that there might be discrimination In the conservation system
if the state imposed a structure that prevented fish from
reaching any of the usual and accustomed grounds of treaty
tribes.

But I don't think there is anything in the treaty that

guarantees that a run of some size or other must reach every,
site that a tribe fished at in 1855.
QUESTION:

If there were, the District Court certainly

35
violated the treaty.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, I think that is implicit in the

50-50 allocation, because this system itself creates the
prospect, the legal entitlement, as the judge has ruled it,
to have the Makans take 50$ of everything coming through the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the non-Indians take the other
half.
The 50-50 allocation is utterly unresponsive to the
problems here, and if anything is a gratuitous limitation.
It has a superficial appeal, but it is not based on the
treaties or in practice.
QUESTION:

Do you think that there can be implied

from the rights given to the Indians by Article III of these
treaties any duty whatsoever, of any allocation whatsoever of
fish to the Indians?
MR. LACOVARA:

In the absence of discrimination,

I would say no, discrimination in the Puyallup sense.
The treaties, I think it is important to emphasize,
Mr. Justice, were designed to secure access to fishing sites,
without a guarantee how productive ~QUESTION:

Access to fishing sites, not access to

a bathtub where you can fish all day and not catch anything.
MR, LACOVARA:

That's correct, but as every fisher­

man kncws, and as the Indians knew, there vjas no guarantee
that there would be fish flowing by those scenes.

The findings

36
say that because of floods, changes in the course of tribu­
taries, many of the sites were no longer productive even in
treaty time.

So it should have been understood that at particu­

lar sites there might not be much fishing.
But that is — with all due respect — a very
artificial assumption here.

The state has been engaged,for

years has been engaged in programs to plant hatchery fish in
streams that would otherwise not receive an adequate flow of
fish because of the commercial harvesting by Indians and nonIndians earlier on in the migratory flow,
So, it is also important to emphasize that the
District Court hasn't found that even a single such site of
the type that you are describing has been completely pre­
empted,

We are a long way, at this stage of this case, from a

finding similar to the one in Puyallup,
My final point is going to be, Mr. Justice White,
that the non-treaty fishermen are entitled to their own day
in court and that there are no procedural obstacles to your
hearing our claims on the merits, but my time has expired and
I will have to rest on my briefs.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Morisset

Very well, Mr. Lacovara.

37

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MASON D. MORISSET, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT INDIAN TRIBES

MR. MORISSET:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
I am Mason Morisset, appearing for the Respondent
Indian tribes in this case.
It will come as no shock to you that I disagree with
Attorney G&neral Gorton, as to virtually everything he said
concerning the facts and the nature of this case, the nature
of the dispute.
The District Judge, in a related case, U.S. v. Oregon,
Judge Bellonl once said, when these arguments were made to him,
"These arguments might make some sense" — I am paraphrasing
— "if we ignore all history, law, facts of the case and the
behavior of the States of Oregon and Washington."
We cannot ignore the facts of this case.

We cannot

ignore that the District Court found that the State of
Washington had preempted Indian fishing.; And, as the Ninth
Circuit put it in its original decision — it is now three
years old — "The State of Washington has ’rendered the
treaty guarantee nugatory.1"
To remember what the state has done here is impor­
tant.

The State began in 1890 by outlawing salmon fishing

during certain times of the year.

They continued in 1915 to

38
outlaw fishing by gaffing and spearing, traditional Indian
methods.

In 1897, the Legislature started closing fresh water

fishing to commercial salmon fishing on an ad hoc basio, and
that was continuous from 1900 on.
cluding much Indian fishing.

That had the effect of pre­

By 19^0, we find the salmon pre­

serves which* .if you will examine the map in the Joint Appendix
at page 3^8, effectively closed most of the Indian areas.QUESTION:

But the essential question is what, under

the treaty, the state had the right to do and what it didn't;
is it not, Mr. Moris*»et?
MR. MORISSET:

That's the essential question, yes.

And it is clear, as the District Court found, in going through
this litany of state actions, that the total effect of this was
to preclude a treaty fishery, for all practical purposes.
You have to put together all of the things the state
did.

I am only up to 1915 and we've got quite a few things.

If you continue with the pattern, you will find no fishing —
QUESTION:

It is conceivable that everything it did

before 1915 was barred by the treaty, and nonetheless the
District Court order might not be in accordance with the treaty;
is it not?
MR. MORISSET:

That's certainly conceivable, but the

Judge had to decide or have some basis for his finding that
there, in fact, had been a preemption of the treaty rights.
And this is what he found, that all these actions had the

39
cumulative effect of ending any treaty right whatsoever.
Given that, he had to move on —
QUESTION:

Isn't your opponent correct, though, the

first thing we have to decide is what is the treaty right?
What does it mean "in common with1?
And I am just wondering, how do you deal with the
argument that, say, at one point in a river the Makahs get
50% and the non-Indians get 50%t and they take it all?

What

happens to another Indian tribe upstream or downstream that
wants its 50%?

What's the answer to that problem?

MR. MORIS^ET:

First of all, as a practical matter,

that virtually can't happen,
QUESTION:

Assume it could happen, under the

District Court findings.
M.R, MORIS SET:

The answer is very simple.

If the

State of Washington does not preempt the fishery — the Indian
share of the fishery -- and the Makahs catch all of the Indian
opportunity, that ends the State's obligation vis-a-vis the
Indians. It becomes an intertribal problem for —
QUESTION:

Doesn't another Indian tribe have- a

legitimate complaint in that situation?
MR. MQRISSST:

Undoubtedly against the Makahs, not

against the State of Washington,
QUESTION:

They have a right under the treaty, if

the District judge is correct.

Not just a right against the

40

other tribes, they have a right against the United States, the
other signatory to the treaty.
MR. MORXSSET:
not this case.

That's right, they probably do.

That's

No one has sued the United States —

QUESTION:

Well, it does test the validity, as my

brother Stevens suggests.

It tests the validity of the

district judge's construction of the treaty.
MR. MORISShTf:

Well, it may test it, vis-a-vis an

action against the United States or tribes, but it simply
proves the point that the State of Washington has met its
obligation, if it has not preempted the Indians' share.
QUESTION:

But it has permitted a certain group of

fishermen to take all the fish.

They just happen to be Indians.

But the state has failed to prevent ejchaustion of the run.
MR. MORIS SET:

The District Court found that the

State of Washington had prevented any tribes anywhere, basic­
ally, from talcing its share of the catch.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose it permits one tribe to

take all the Indian share.
MR. MORIS,SET:

Isn't it in just as much trouble?

No, it isn't, under the decision.

It is not required to make allocations between the tribes.
QUESTION:

I know it would be consistent with the

decree, but how about under the treaty?

How about all the

other treaties?
MR. MORISSET:

No.

I don't believe that the State

41
of Washington has an obligation under the treaty to allocate
fish among the tribes.

That's a matter for them, between

themselves, or for them and the United States Government.

The

State of Washington doesn’t have that obligation.
QUESTION:

It's in trouble if it fails to provide

the Indians’ share of the fish, but it is not in any trouble if
it deprives all but one tribe of the fish.
MR. MORISSET:

No.

You are misstating what it is

in trouble in what it does.
It is in trouble if it allows a fishery to be pre­
empted by the non-union fishermen, which is xuhat it has done
In this case,-.
QUESTION:

But it can be preempted by one tribe

without the State being in trouble?
MR. MORISSET:

That’s right.

Of course, we have a major battle over that between
the tribes and the United States Government, but that’s not
the state's obligation under the treaty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Morisset, putting the same problem

in a little different framework, let's put ourselves back in
1854 and '55 and say there are three or four tribes on the
same river.
Is it reasonable to assume that in using the word
"common" in four or five successive treaties, affecting the
same run of fish, that Governor Stevens Intended to give 50%

42

of that run to four or five different groups of Indians?
MR. MORISSET:

Well, he intended to allow the

signatories to any one treaty — and there are five major ones
and a sixth that has a peripheral interest here — to receive,
the District Court found, 50$ of the harvestable share, or an
opportunity to catch 50$ of the harvestable share of fish
reaching their usual and accustomed places.
They did not guarantee that any fish would reach
there.
QUESTION:

But is that a reasonable interpretation

of the situation at that time, if there were more than one
tribe on one river affected by two successive treaties?
MR. MORISSET:

Well, maybe I don't understand your

question, Mr. Justice Stevens, but certainly the Indians and
Governor Stevens knew that there were a lot of Indians from
different tribes and bands that would all be fishing together.
Re knew there ivould be other tribes and bands that would be
intercepting fish before they got there.

They simply were

talking about what was going to be left when it got to their
place, understanding that there would probably be preemption
by other Indian tribes before it got there, or some fishing
on those runs.
We are not talking about that kind of a situation.
We are talking about a situation in which the state, through
this long history of legislative action, has allowed the non-

43
treaty fishermen to essentially preempt the entire fishery.
We are not talking about a situation where one tribe
or the other may catch most of the tribal share before it gets
to a particular river.
QUESTION:

Well, the state is obligated, then, I

gather, from your point of view, to make sure that some fish
reach Indian fishing grounds?
MR. MORISSET:

No, not in the sense that they must

guarantee freedom from Acts of God and freed ran from inter­
ceptions by other Indian tribes.

This is not an affirmative

duty to guarantee that fish get back to the river or the
marine areas which this side of the table sometimes claims.
QUESTION:

But it has a duty not to — If the reason

is that non-Indian fishermen have taken it, the state is in
trouble?
MR. MORISSET:

That's right, because of the history

of how they have done it.
I got up to the salmon preserve area and I could have
gone on for another eighteen points about how the entire
regulatory scheme has essentially preempted the fishery to a
particular segment of the population, namely, the high-tech­
nology, motorized vessels.

And that is what the state has

done through a pattern of laws and regulations that the court
found to be wrong.
QUESTION:

I think the state concedes, that it has a

44
duty to provide what It calls an "equal opportunity fishery."
And if, in fact, these present laws don't, I think it concedes
that they should be modified because of that duty.

That was

my understanding of its submission.
MR. MORISSET:

That’s correct, although I am not sure

how they are using the phrase "equal opportunity."

They seem

to be using it in the old hackneyed version, the same as
everyone else, which I thought we had gone through since
VJinans, on to Puyallup and Antoine and these various other
cases.

And if they are using it in that sense, that in effect

is no treaty right at all.
point again.

We are simply back to the beginning

If that’s what the Attorney General means, I

disagree with that.
I would like to move on to discuss the question of
what "in common with" means, and once again to disagree with
how the question was put.
Vie don’t view this as a question of what "in common
with’ means by itself.

This is, among other things, a contract

and it must be construed as a whole to all its parts and
certainly the entire phrase, "the right of taking fish," which
is the first right; "at certain places," which is the second
right;

as limited by or explained by the phrase "in common

with."
And we think it is a hopeless quagmire to focus
solely on "in common with," although we played the game in our

45
briefs, too, and got into all sorts of esoteric British Treaty
cases, and so on, none of which, I think, anyone can understand.
QUK3TI0N:

And certainly Indians didn’t know anything

about in 1855.
MR. MORISSET:

That's right.

And I think someone

made the point that we probably are viewing Secretary Gibbs,
who was a lawyer, as having a much more erudite education than
he probably had.

Maybe he did know about these things.

Those are helpful.

But I think the important thing for us

to get across is that we must construe the treaty as a whole.
IS was designed to guarantee that the Indians would continue
to make a good livelihood fishing.

The record is full of

evidence and there are findings of fhct which support that,
QUESTION:

Let's say one agreed with you.

Didn’t

then Judge Bolt err in his first decision fcy thinking almost
that he had no discretion, that "in common with" meant 50$?
MR. MORISSET:

No, I don’t think he erred.

I think

that it is a little dangerous to try to pigeonhole this whole
process that the state has, and try to say this was purely a
legal decision or purely an equitable decision.
was a mixture and there are elements of both.

I think it
I think he

exercised more equity in deciding whether or not it was neces­
sary to have an allocation at all, in which he looked at all
the facts.

Once he decided that, he decided more cr less as

a matter of law that’s what it was.

46
QUESTION:

That "in common with" meant 50$, and

then the Court of Appeals in affirming it said, well, it is
a tenancy in .common, and that means 50$.
MR. MORISSET:

That's one of the rationales they

used.
I think all of the facts in the case support that
finding,that there was a substantial amount of understanding
on the Indian side of equality.

I don't know if that meant

50$, but it certainly meant no restrictions on either side.
QUESTION:

Po you agree with the Attorney General's

reading of your brief that non-treaty Indians are like the
non-Indian' fishermen?

QUESTION:

Do they have any fishing —

MR. MORISSET:
QUESTION:

They are citizens, as far as --

So, you would say if there had been a

treaty with only one tribe that had this fisning allocation,
Judge Bolt would still have been right in giving 50# to that
one tribe, and none of the other tribes would have any fishing
rights?
MR. MORISSET:

At Its places only, and none of the

other tribes would have rights.

They would have had a claim

for a taking, which is what all the pages and pages of Claims
Commission cases are about, as well as the land claims.

But

there also are claims for taking of aboriginal fishing rights.
Now, finally, I would like to point out the ‘'said
Indians" problem which several Justices.—.Mr, Justice Stewart
is concerned about, and ask you to read, if you get a chance,
the entire Treaty of Point Elliott that's in our big red brief.
You will see that "said Indians" and "said tribes
and bands" are used interchangeably.
Article IX, which is the Deliver Up provision, jumps
all over the place between "said tribes and bands" and "said
Ind ians."

43
Article II says, "We reserve as reservation for said
tribes and bands the- following land."

That's a reservation

for the said tribes and bands.
Article V says, "to help the said Indians remove
there, we are going to pay them" so much money.
And if you go on through the treaty, contrary to what
the Attorney General says, you will see "said tribes and bands"
and "said Indians" being used both way3*

And I think the only

fair discussion of what that means is that they were inter­
changeable phrases.

"Said Indians" meant the "tribes and bends"

and "tribes and bands" meant the "said Indians."

There is

really no other way to get at what that phrase meant.
My time has expired.
QUESTION;

You will, of course, say that Article III

was a reservation, although, by its terms, unlike Article II,
for example, it certainly is not; is it?

It doesn't say, "It

is hereby reserved," but 'is hereby secured," which could
lead to the argument that it wasn't a reservation, that there
was a conveyance of it and then an agreement that, none the
less, these rights would be secured.
MR. MORISSET:

Article II of the Point Elliott

Treaty reserves certain land —
QUESTION;

It is, by its terms, a reservation.

Article III is not, by its terms, a reservation.
MR. MORISSET:

Article III doesn't have — I am sorry,

49
ifc's a different article.
Article V in this treaty says "secured to said
Indians."
QUESTION:

I think most of them do, if not all.

MR. MORISSET:

I think you are right.

The answer, I think, again, there

— that's use

of terms interchangeably — and certainly this Court has always
said before — I see no good reason to change it — that it
was a reservation of rights that the Indians had before the
treaty.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Claiborne.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Perhaps, I ought to begin by trying to identify the
central issue as we see it.
This is not unlike previous cases before this Court,
a case about whether the Indian right to fish can be regulated
by state lav;.

That point is conceded at the outset.

QUESTION:

Now, it is conceded which way?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That the state may regulate the

Indian fishing rights, provided —
QUESTION:

It may and it may not, both.

require licenses, isn't that right?

It can't

50

MR. CLAIBORNE;

It raay regulate it In the interest

of conservation when that is necessary.
But certain things it may not apply.

QUESTION;

Certain of its conservation laws

it may not apply to the

Indians; isn't that right?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The question., Mr. Justice Stewart,

is yes, which It can and which it cannot.
QUESTION;
way or the other.

But in any event, it is all conceded one
That's your point?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

There is no — I mean only to say

this.

There is no claim of immunity from state conservation

laws.

That is not the issue in the case.

The issue in the

case is how those conservation or allocation laws ought to
be accommodated to respect the treaty right.

And that leads

us to look to the treaty right not as to whether it immunizes
the Indian fishing right from all state regulation, but what
the character of It is.
Nor is the case, as the State now seeks to make it,
the question of whether the Indians can today so effectively
compete that they no longer need the protection which the
treaties afford them.
If the treaties afford them protection, they are
entitled to it, whether or not they presently need it or will
for some years to come.
VJe turn then to the character of the right which is

51

secured by these treaties.

And the issue here seems to be

whether it is a mere right of access — a sort of limited go
off the reservation and go fishing if there are any fish to
find there — a right which it was quite unnecessary to provide
for.

Even then, there was no thought that the Indians were

confined to the reservation — or whether, rather, the right
!

secured by these treaties is a property right, a share in the
fishery.
QUESTION:

Mr, Claiborne, is it correct that it

would have been totally valuless?
problem?

Wasn't there an easement

I mean isn't it possible their usual and accustomed

banks and streams could have all been bought up by private
owners and without this right they wouldn't have had access?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, in that respect

alone, that is, that the peculiarity of the right of access
„ granted by the treaty is said to be, as Ulna ns held, that
it includes a right to cross private property, a right not
otherwise available to citizens.
QUESTION:

It could be quite vital, could it not?

It is net just a matter of wandering around in open land.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It could, but when we are speaking

of fishing in Puget Sound that is, of course, a meaningless
aspect of the right.

When we are talking about the Columbia

River, as was the case in Wlnans, the right of access to the
river banks Is important because that-river could not be fished

fremi the water.

They could only fish from the bank.

But with respect to the treaties governing Puget
Sound, that aspect, that easement, tvould be for the most part
of no value whatever.
QUESTION:

But the treaty, itself, then spells out

the right to build structures, and so forth, so it does seem
to be thinking, at least in part, about access.
MR, CLAIBORNE:
Mr. Justice Stewart,

The treaties are all of a pattern,

No doubt, some of them had in mind the

situation on the Columbia, as did the treaty with the
and some had in mind the situation in Puget Sound.

Yakimas

Bu.t the

language was not varied in accordance with the circumstances.
QUESTION:

I am referring to the "erecting tempor­

ary houses" language, which does seem to be thinking in terms
of access.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr* Justice Stevens, I suggest that

that language is of not much value in Puget Sound.

It is of

some value along river banks.
QUESTION:

I understand, but at least it was con­

sidered valuable seme place.
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

Indeed.

When you talk about that not being of

much value, if the State's map at page 348, of Areas 1 and 2
along the Straits of San Juan de Fuca, means anything, there
is a very substantial stretch of land where access rights to

53
the strait would mean something, I would think.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But, Mr» Justice Stevens, those

banks, those areas are fished by boat, not from the bank, and
as long as there Is a place where there is a public access to
the strait it matters not whether it's adjacent to the usual
and accustomed fishing ground.
QUESTION:

That's strictly boat fishing in the

strait?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think that's so.

Now, as to which it is, whether it is a mere right
of access ox- whether it's a share of the fishery —
QUESTION:

It is at least a right of access.

It is this or that.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

to suggest that it is more.

Mr. Justice Stewart, I meant

It is a share in the fishery.

It is not a mere right of access.
And as to resolving that question, we look first
to the language of the treaty itself.

as has been suf­

ficiently pointed out, the language of the treaty does not
give a right of access to water.
fish.

That is at least suggested.

It gives a right of taking
We are talking about a

right in a fishery, not a means of getting there.
The other word which is, in my submission, significant,
on the v/ording of the treaty itself, is the word "secured."

It has been suggested that that may suggest that there was a
grant from the United States, rather than a reservation by the
Indians.
2 had viewed that question as foreclosed by the
decisions of this Court, beginning in Vi 1 nans, where that was
very expressly held, down to the most recent in Puyallup III, in
which that same view of the Article III language was taken,
that it was a reservation of former exclusive rights which the
Indians enjoyed, which the tribes enjoyed, not a grant by the
United States of a fishing right to them.
But turning to the word "secured," the significance
of that language, it seems to us, is that it promises the
protection, the security of the United States Government, to
assure that the right of taking fish will not in future be
interfered with.

Not an insignificant promise.

QUESTION;

Do you sort of construe that as a guarantee

of the right of catching fish, not just of the right of fishing?
MR. CLAIBORNE;
QUESTION:

I go by stages.

I must say, that's a right I would have

greatly enjoyed many times, but then I am not an Indian.
MR* CLAXBORNE:

We say it's a guarantee against

encroachments or interferences,with the right to fish in
particularized locations.

Encroachments can come in many

The most obvious is that which the Court confronted in

Ivina ns, that is the ousting of the Indians by the impiae ement

their access to the site.

of a dam,

One need only think

created downstream which prevented the fish from

reaching the usual Indian fishing place.

That, it seems to us*

is the sort of encroachment also which the United States was
securing the Indian right to fish against.
And the same is true with respect to state regula­
tions which have precisely that effect.

One such regulation

was the one that this Court confronted in Puyallup II* in which
albeit the Indians, like everyone else, were free to catch
steelhead by hook and line downstream, they were prevented
from doing it in their usual and accustomed way at their
usual and accustomed place by nets upstream.

And the court

said this preventing the fish from reaching them in harvestable numbers is an interference with their treaty right.
That is precisely what this case is about.
The fact that the treaty language itself suggests —
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, the accustomed

fishing ground for these tribes, I take it from the Attorney
General’s statement, is the entire Puget Sound?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

If one puts together the separate

accustomed fishing grounds —
QUESTION:

The state doesn't suggest that any tribe

is precluded from fishing anywhere in Puget sound; do you?

56
MR. CLAIBORNE:

The state may not suggest it, but

I suggest —
QUESTION:

Well, what about the treaty?

Do you

think the treaty gives any particular tribe the right to
fish anywhere in Puget Sound?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

No.

Why doesn»fc it?

MR, CLAIBORNE:

Because the individual treaties

give Individual tribes particularised locations, and beyond
that area they are not protected by the treaty.
QUESTION:

Are they protected in the treaty — Does

the treaty give them a right that you speak of to take fish
In Puget Sound?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

It gives some tribes a protected

right to fish in some parts of Puget Sound.

It gives other

tribes rights elsewhere, and so on.
QUESTION:

I suppose,then, you could think of a

tribe that If it were found fishing In the straits, that
seme of them might have the right to do that and some might
not have

a treaty right to do it,
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Yes.

And, indeed, the District

Judge, very particularly identifified the usual and accustomed
fishing grounds of each of the tribes, not onljr those con­
ferred by each treaty,but each of the tribes covered by the
five treaties.

And they overlap.

They don't all cover the

57
entire area by any means.
The tribes, such as the Nesquale and the Puyallup
at the bottom of Puget Sound, have no rights in the strait,
nor even in the upper part of the sound.
\

It may happen, and perhaps the District Judge was
over-generous in defining usual and accustomed places, that
ivhen you add all of these rights together you cover the entire
area.

But the state makes no objection to that.

The reason

they do not is that they want to be able to say these Indians
can compete quite adequately with us, in effect, everywhere.
QUESTION:

So, you would say that the state would

still be violating the treaty if it said, "The only place we
are going to allow fishing Is out here In this particular fourmile square area of Puget Sound and we are going to allow six
Indians and six white commercial fishermen."
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, I would say

that.
QUESTION:

And each of them can take as many as they

want, as long as they leave enough for conservation.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I would say that the tribes of the

lower sound had been promised, had been secured, the right
which they reserved and which is always there to fish In their
rivers, at the mouths of their rivers and nearby.
QUESTION:

The right to take fish?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

The right to take fish.

But in

58
Mr. Justice White's example, they would even be prevented
from attempting to take fish, and that unless that were
essential for conservation, which your example does not
suggest, it would be a violation of the treaty.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with counsel that the state

would be in no trouble if it permitted one tribe to take all
the fish?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice White, I think I have

to differ with him on that point.
are two ways of looking at it.

It seems to me that there

Of course, it is an accident

of history that there were five treaties rather than one.
It is simply the fact that Governor Stevens couldn't bring
the Indians into one location at one time.

But, nevertheless,

we are faced with five different treaties in immediate sequence,
but still one before the other.
I think, perhaps, the proper way to look at it is
to say that the 50$ share which we say is simply a limit on
the Indian right, not the definition of the right.

It is

the consequence of the "in common with" language.
That 50$ share applied only to so ranch of the run
as in those days, after Indian fishing further out, reached
that location.

In that way, one confines the Makah at the

head of the strait to a proportion that must allow a reasonable
share to reach those at the end of the ladder, for instance
the Nesquale

59
Now, the District judge did not attempt to make those
allocations and, as it happens, the Indian tribes of the area
are in a cooperative spirit.

They have formed a fisheries

commission of their own, and they, themselves, police these
allocation problems to the extent that they exist.

And they

exist to a very minor extent because the capability of any
given tribe to catch the numbers of fish that would prejudice
thdir neighbors is not yet, at least, serious.
It may also be that Governor Stevens over-promised
and vie must accommodate for that today.

No one suggests that

one should add 50# shares s<o as to leave non-Indians less
than half of the total.
QUESTION:

Maybe it is the District Court that over­

promised ♦
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice White, District Court

merely said that the total Indian share ought not exceed 50#.
Now, if I may turn to the consequence of this being
a reservation of a right, rather than a grant by the United
States.

It seems to me that helps us in determining what is

really the next question.

Assuming the Indians have a share

in this fishery, what sort of share?
QUESTION:

I understood you to say that you did not

rely on the word "common" as creating the 50# figure, but
rather that the right you described ultimately leads to an
allocation of 50#.

What is the justification for 50# under

60

your view of the treaty?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
misspoke.

Mr. Justice Stevens, I obviously

I meant to say that the "In common with" language

is precisely how we get 50$ language.

But In this sense, that

what was promised to the tribes was the right to fish as they
used to, basically without limits, for commercial and other
purposes, so much as was necessary to satisfy their reasonable
needs.

But they were required to share the fisheries with

non-Indians.

And that, of course, is indicated by the words

"in common."
We say it may be right, indeed, probably Is right
to read that "in common with’ language as placing a 50$ limit
on the Indian share.

They may satisfy their needs, but no

more than 50$.
QUESTION:

But that assumes that the Indians had

100$ before the treaty.

MR. CLAIBORNE;

And that is precisely what this

Court explicitly said in its most recent decision in Puyallup.
These former exclusive rights of the tribes must now be shared
with non-Indians because the treaty — they gave that much

away,
QUESTION:

Exclusive rights in all the waterways

out to the three-mile limit?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I am only quoting this Court's

decision in Puyallup, which of course involved the river, well

61

inland.
QUESTION:

I don't remember that quote.

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Stevens* I believe it

occurs on page 176 of the 433rd Volume of the United States
Reports* 433 U.S* p. 176, Footnote 16* in referring to Article
III* which is quoted.

After the quotation of the treaty* the

opinion goes on to say:
sentence

"As to the treaty fishemen,"this

— the sentence securing 'in common xvith' — "affects

a reservation of a previously exclusive right."
That is* in our submission, the exactly accurate
characterization.

It Is a reservation and it is a right which

was previously exclusive to the tribes of the area.
They might have retained their exclusive right.
They were persuaded to share it.

When one looks at it from

that starting point* it is not surprising that one may be
entitled to conclude that they didn't give away at least more
than half of the right which they previously enjoyed alone.
QUESTION:

What did the tribes give up in the Treaty

of Medicine Creek?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
QUESTION:

They gave up most of their land —

Was that the whole State of Washington?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

It was all of the State of Washington

west of the Cascade Mountains — these particular tribes that
we are concerned with in this case.

They received some pay­

ment* but primarily and as Dr. .Lane who* as an anthropologist,

They kept on talking about their fish.

That was their

It was well known to both Governor Stevens and

Mr. Gibbs that they had to be satisfied that they would keep
their fisheries.

Governor Stevens said in so many words,

"This paper secures your fish."

That is the text on which

we rely.
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, going back to that

footnote, suppose there v?a$ no footnote in the opinion, the
observation you read.

Does that concept reflect anything

more than the historical fact that before the white man came
the Indians had exclusive possession, unless there were some
Eskimos, or some other people around there?

They had ex­

clusive rights until others came along and began to compete
with them, did they not?
ME. CLAIBORNE:

Mr, Chief Justice, to some extent.

The historical assumption must be qualified by the fact that
there were, indeed, other people already who had come there.
The Donation Act in 1850 had invited settlers to come into the
Oregon Territory, which included all of Washington and much
else.
QUESTION:
right.

But clearly it was once an exclusive

Then you put it in another time frame, the date of the

63
treaty.

That's another problem, though at one time it was

an exclusive right.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly so, Mr. Chief Justice.

But what is important is that the Government of the
United States recognized that the Indian title, the Indian
occupancy, was exclusive and ought to be endec! by a treaty.
It Is not as though by gradual process the white man had pushed
the Indian aside.

It was a deliberate determination on the

part of the United States to buy what was, for the purposes
of the treaty, recognized to be an Indian claim of exclusive
occupancy of both land and rivers, and of course the fish that
migrate there.
Now, as I say, the Indians might have reserved their
right there altogether, as indeed they did in Alaska, or as
this Court found that they had in Alaska.

entitled to keep it ail.

They were

They conceded the right of others

to fish with them.
At worst, that ought to be viewed as conceding half
of their previously exclusive fishery.
Certainly, we say, they did not buy a future in
which they might be ousted or nearly ousted from their tra­
ditional fisheries simply because the white man, in greater
numbers and with superior technology, would crowd out the Indian.

64
Now* it is perfectly true that* at the time, there
was no knowledge of the future need for conservation restric­
tions.

But what was anticipated, even then, or must have been,

is first that the Indian might be fenced out of his fishing
place because that had happened.

White man had come and

fenced cut an Indian even before the treaties.

And so the

language which protects their fishing places through the
easement.
QUESTION:

What do you suppose Justice McKenna

meant In his opinion for the Court in Wlnans, In that one
sentence to which our attention has been called,kind of
almost Biblical language, "And that there may be an adjustment,
an accommodation of them" —"them!' is the relative rights and
obligations under the treaty -- "the Sollicitor General con­
cedes and points out the way."
Have you looked at the SG!s brief in that case?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I have, Mr, Justice Stewart, and

It gives me an occasion to correct an impression i-jhich has
perhaps been left with the Court, I am sure Inadvertently,
by the Attorney General.
That is the Solicitor General was suggesting that
they go fish elsewhere.

Now, that is precisely what he was

combating.
QUESTION:

You say he was not doing that?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

He was not doing that.

In fact, he

devoted most of his brief to the proposition that the Indians
had been promised a right to fish there, not elsewhere;
\irhether they were other places was neither here nor there.
And I quote language from page 16 of the Brief filed by the
Solicitor General, in what was Number 180 of the October
Term, 1904, "There was a general allegation in the answer,"
he says, "that there were fisheries at places where the title
was still in the Government."

But that suggestion was left

vague and there was no proof on the subject.
In any event, the Indians have rights here or they
have not.

They cannot be shunted off to Inferior places on

the theory that it is a legitimate defense to say they will
do well enough at other points.
QUESTION:

This sentence has to mean something.

You are telling us what it doesn't mean.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

V.'hafc does it mean?

He did suggest — and if I can turn

to his precise suggestion — There were four fish wheels in the
case which monopolised the locations where the wheels were.
He says, "It certainly seems that four wheels in the
space of a mile and a half are inordinate.

If they ought to

be maintained at all, there should be some restriction as to
their nuraber and method and daily hours of operation."
Restriction on the Winan Brothers in order to give
the fish and the Indians a chance.
"Certainly the wheels should not be permitted to

66
create and maintain a monopoly until all the fish are gone.
One at least of these wheels has been placed at a particular
spot which was obviously a most advantageous place for the
Indians to fish, because there was a great rock there from
which their platform or staging projected, so that they could
use their dip nets for the longest possible time without being
driven back up the bank or bluff by rising water."
I skip a little,
And then, referring now to the Indians, "On the
other hand, they cannot claim to have an exclusive right and
enjoying

their right in common with citizens and under

the modified injunction in common i*ith defendants, it may be
just to restrict in reas onable ways their times and modes of
access to the property and hours of fishing.
"It is not fair, under the present conditions, that
they should enjoy, without restriction, their ancient right
of camping and curing in temporary houses on the defendant's
property.
"If it is unfair, a decree can Indicate the proper
limitation.

It may be that there ought to be some composition

of that right or some arrangement by the defendants or the
United States."
That's as far as the suggestion goes.
But it clearly is a suggestion that fishing at that
place ought to be in some manner divided in terms of hours

67
for the Indians to fish, hours for the wheels to operate.
Now, we say that that is the most obvious abuse,
that Involved in Winans.

It is equally impermissible to pre­

vent, not the Indians from reaching the fishing places, but
the fish from reaching them, which empties the right to fish
at those locations of any substance.

And that is what the

structure of the regulations which have been annulled in this
case accomplished, to prevent a fair or equal share of the
fish which through this funnel of the strait and then the
sound eventually reach the majority of the fishing sites,
the traditional sites, which are are in the sound at the
mouths of the rivers.
To allow the fishery to be fished out before the
fish get to the places is as much a violation of the treaty
as to prevent the Indians from reaching it at all.
I leave it there.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General,

you have three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ..,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER STATE OF WASHINGTON
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr, Claiborne

in reading from the Solicitor General's instructions, said
that he skipped a little bit.

Here's what he skipped:

!lIn any case, it is true that if they can fish to
advantage elsewhere than at the particular points where the

68
•wheels are, they should he allowed to fish without undue
restriction up and down the river and above and below the
wheels throughout the entire waterfront."
That's exactly what my point to you was, as you
asked these questions about the empty right, the right tc
fish in the bathtub, beforehand ♦

They also answered that

question as the United States has always carried on its own
activities.

When the United States builds or licenses a dam,

Bonneville or otherwise, it destroys those usual and accustomed
places and makes thesi bathtubs and gives them places elsewhere
to make up for them.
My example of —
QUESTION:

Is that generally done by negotiation

and agreement?
MR. GORTON:

I can't answer that question, specific­

ally, but what I am saying is that that's exactly what the
State proposes to do in managing the fishery properly.
Of course, if we must let those fish get all the
way up to the source of the river, so that a hundred fish
will get back to a usual and accustomed station and waste fen
thousand fish in other runs, we should be permitted to say to
the Indians,

"If we give you a better right elsewhere in the

marine waters and you have the capabilities of exercising your
right better there, that is appropriate management."
exactly what the United States does.

That's

QUESTION:

Maybe you would have the right to

negotiate and agree to that and maybe you wouldn’t have the
right to do it unilaterally*
MR, GORTON:

In any event, the thrust of my argu­

ment i3 that in Winans that's what you said, by asking them
to follow the Solicitor General, could be done.

It's what

happens when dams are done.
You. are correct, if we can't do that, if we must
return those hundred fish to the head waters, then there must
be an allocation,
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne's concluding point was, if

I understood him, that the Ulnans right of Indian access to
these usual and accustomed spots is one part of the Article
III guarantee.

And another part of it is that there will be

fish there when the Indians get there.

It is sort of the

freedom of the fish to get there.
If that's true, then that must imply some duty of
allocation.
MR. GORTON:

It clearly does.

Or the Indians can

be given an at least equally advantageous place.
the Solicitor General suggested in 1905.

That's what

It's what the United

States did when It built the dams and it's what an equal oppor­
tunity fishery, properly administered, will actually do.
QUESTION:
says today.

But it's not what the Solicitor General

70

MRo GORTON:
QUESTION:

It certainly Is not.
Well, v*e are bound by what he says today,

aren *t we?
MJR. GORTON:
was correctly read.

Mr. Justice Stevens, your Footnote 16
Remember, however, that every previous

case dealt with a river fishery, where perhaps ownership of the
bed or river might be Included, and that in none of those
earlier cases was that characterization of a reservation,versus
being secured,remotely necessary to the decision of the case.
They were all correctly stated.
I believe that conceptually there is no question but
that the non-Indian citizens of the Territory of Washington
had the right to fish in Puget Sound before the treaty.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gorton, may I ask one last question.

Under your version of the treaty, your understanding
of the treaty, assume there are, say, 6,000 Indians and
600,000 white people that want to fish on the river.

Is It

your view that they are entitled to one-thousandth of the
fish?
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

No.
Say you win on the 5C$ claim, what do

they end up with when we get all through viith the whole thing?
MR. GORTON:

They are entitled to an equal opportunity

fishery, and whether or not they would be given an equal oppor­
tunity —

71

QUESTION:

Well, that would be 10,000 —

MR. GORTON:

No, it would not, I don't think.

Whether they have an equal opportunity fishery in­
volves the consideration of many questions.

In Puyallup II

you listed some of those questions. The number of nets, the
number of fishermen, is one thing.

More Indians fish than

non-Indians, so purely per capita would not necessarily
recognize an equal opportunity fish for Indians,

It might be

one factor which was considered, but it would be only one
factor among many.
I tried to point out that if the result of this
Court's decision right now is an equal opportunity fishery,
the Indian share will be infinitely larger than the nonIndian share.
QUESTION:

That's because you've limited the number

of non-Indian licenses.

Supposing you book off the limit on

the number of non-Indian licenses.
MR. GORTON:

That might very well at some point

bring us to a violation of the treaty because we are pre­
empting the Indian fishery, as we were in Puyallup II.
We cannot make it an empty right.

We are not

required to allocate 50$-plus or any fixed number —
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Or any other, percentage.
— or any other fixed number which is

just set in concrete from now until the end of time

72

QUESTION:

When you say you cannot make it an empty

right, that does imply a duty at some point to assure the
presence of fish, by allocation or otherwise, or limitation *
MR. GORTON:

Yes, or assure their presence where

the fish are and where they can effectively compete.
Thank you,
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, you read, and I

take it you were reading from your own brief or the quote from
the 1904 Solicitor General's brief.
MR. GORTON:
QUESTION:

The Solicitor General's brief,
What page, so we don't have to go back

to the original?
MR. GORTON:

The bottom of page 85 and the top of

page 86 of our initial brief, and it was from that quote that
Mr. Claiborne was reading too, but he skipped the lines which
I just read to you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
('Whereupon, at 11:42 o'clock, a.m., the case was
submitted
