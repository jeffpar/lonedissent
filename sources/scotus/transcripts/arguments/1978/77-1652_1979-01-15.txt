ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOW AH) E. SHAPIRO* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
MR, SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
These consolidated cases involve the obligations of
producers to supply natural gas under the Natural Gas Act of
19380

The case concerns a statement of policy developed in an

informal rule-making proceeding conducted by the predecessor of
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission* the Federal Power
Commission.
The Commission undertook to determine what standard
of deliverability a certificated producer of natural gas is
required to live up to under the provisions of the Natural Gas
Act.

The policy the Commission eventually adopted requires

producers of dedicated gas to produce gas they are required to
supply under their certificates* under the standard of a prudent
operator as that standard is reflected in state laws governing
production.
There are two petitions here.

f

The first is the

4
petition of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which
Inquires whether the production and gathering exclusion in
Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act bars the Commission from
adopting the "prudent operator2'standard as the delivery criterion
under the Natural Gas Act.
The second petition is by the Consumer Energy Council
of America, and it contends that the Commission has the author­
ity to adopt a deliverability standard that affects production,
but it goes on to say that the "prudent operator" standard isir an
inappropria te s ta nda rd.
The Court of Appeals held that the Commission was
barred by Section l(b) of the Natural Gas Act, particularly the
production and gathering exclusion in Section l(b), from adop­
ting a "prudent operator"standard.

So, the Court of Appeals

said that the Commission had gone too far in adopting the
standard.
The consumers argue that the Commission did not go
far enough and that the'brudent operator" standard doesn't meet
the requirements of the Act.
The consumers have, with the Court's permission,
conceded three minutes to the Commission in the division of
time in this case, so that the Commission would have twenty»
three minutes, the consumers seventeen.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, I wasn't quite as clear as

you seem to be as to what question is presented by the

5
Commission's briefg because 1 realize that the ordez* adopted by
the Commission says that "on or after July 30, 1976, all certifi­
cates of public convenience and necessity will contain this
provision."
And yet, if you turn to page 16 of the brief for the
Commission, the first sentence in the first full paragraph says,
"The principal Issue in this case is whether the Natural Gas
Act imposes an obligation on certificate holders which the
Commission has jurisdiction to enforce, that they act as
reasonably prudent operators in maintaining deliveries to
interstate commerce of gas from dedicated reserves/1
And you go on to say that this is going to have vital
importance for many, many years because apparently it is in­
corporated by force of the Natural Gas Act in certificates
issued prior to

19760

Is that your position?
MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That is the position, Your Honorc

Well, that's a little different than saying

that the Commission was empowered to choose this as a regulation
implementing the statute] isn't it?

That's saying that the

statute required the Commission to do it.
MR0 SHAPIRO:

Well, essentially, the Commission's

position is it has made an interpretation of the statute to
define what the standard of deliverabllity isB

What it found

in this rule-making proceeding was that there was a great deal

6
of uncertainty as to just what producers® obligations were to
deliver gas,

.And it concluded in the ultimate decision, Order

No, 539-Bit, that there was implicit in the delivery obligation
that exists under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, an obligation
to maintain delivery that reaches the duty to at least see that
there is sufficient gas produced to meet the obligation.
The Commission found that this waa implicit in exis­
ting certificates and that it was an appropriate interpretation
of the statute as the service obligation had been defined by
this Court in *—
QUESTION:

When was the. Gas Act adopted?

MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

1938, Your Honor.

And this is an interpretive regulation that

was adopted by the Commission in 1976?
MR, SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor,

One reason that the question had not come to the fore
was because, as long as there was more gas available than could
1

-

■>

j

■

meet =•» more gas available than the market would absorb, there
was little question that every producer would try to deliver all
the gas he coulda and market all the gas he could.
When the gas shortage of the late “60s and early
'70s developed, there came — questions began to arise as to
just what the duty of the producer was.

Mow, the Commission's

order in this case did not rest on any finding that there had
been some diversion of gas from, the unregulated — to the

7
unregulated intrastate market, from, the regulated interstate
market.

But the Commission did find that there was great un=

certainty as to the scope of the deliverability obligation and
it undertook to define that.

Its ultimate answer was that

implicit in existing certificates under this,Court's decisions
in Sunray and, for that matter, in California Vo Southland, was
an obligation not simply to sell gas, as a commodity, but also
to deliver gas until there was an authorization from the Commission to cease delivering»
Justice Rehnqulst?s questions have touched on another
matter I should briefly mention.

In November of 1978» Congress

passed the Natural Gas Policy Act.

That new statute changes

the basis of regulation for the future rather significantly.
It extends price control to both the intrastate market and the
interstate market.
However, it also expressly continues in effect nonprice regulation under the Natural Gas Act for gas previously
dedicated to interstate commerce.

That gas is, therefore, still

;

impressed with the service obligation that would apply to dedi­
cated gas under the Natural Gas Act, and is still subject to
the requirement that it continue to be delivered until abandon­
ment authority is obtained.
The matter is significant because, among other things,
pricing under the new statute for gas previously dedicated to
interstate commerce

is somewhat lower than prices for other

8
categories of gas,
QUESTION:

Do you think the Commission made this

point quite as clearly to the Fifth Circuit as you are making
it to us?
MR0 SHAPIRO:

Well, the Natural Gas Policy Act

What they expressly declared

was that they made -» they found this standard to be implicit
in existing certificates and they said that this implicit
standard should be made explicit in future certificates.
Now, Section 1(b) defines the acopa of the Natural
Gas Act.
QUESTION:

Had the Commission ever taken a different

view?
MR, SHAPIRO:

The Commission, with respect to its

jurisdiction and the nature of the delivery obligation
certainly not since Sunray.
QUESTION:

Sunray clarified the nature

Well, you had taken a far more expansive

view in this very proceeding, hadn't you?
MR, SHAPIRO:

In this proceeding, the Commission first

undertook to adopt,what I would call, a quantitative delivery

MR. SHAPIRO:

It found it to be implicit in certifi­

It thought originally that it was reflected in certifi­

cates and in existing contracts that underlay certificates*
QUESTION:

And in the statute, or not?

MRc SHAPIRO:

And it thought that It. was permissible

to impose the standard under the statute*
QUESTION:

Permissible, but not required?

MR, SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's right, not required.

But now the position is that the ’'prudent

operator" standard is implicit in the Act, but that's required
by the statute?
MR. SHAPIRO:

A deliverabilifcy standard is required

that assures the maintenance of delivery*

And this is the

standard the Commission feels is the appropriate standard to
achieve that result.
Now,, Section l(b) defines the scope of the Natural
Gas Act*

It affirmatively states that the Act covers transi

Mv,
\v

portation of natural gas in interstate commerce, sale of natural
gas in interstate commerce for resale to consumers and natural
gas companies engaged in such transportation or sales.

It ex-

pressly excludes other transportation or sales, local distri­
bution and distribution facilities and -- the exclusion involved

here — the production and gathering of natural gas.
This Court's decisions in $ unray and in California
Vo

Southlands however, have made clear that the term "sale"

as it is used in the statute, both in Section 1(b) and elsewhere, carries with it an additional concept, the concept of

service»

That service, as applied to producers, is an obliga»

tion to maintain delivery»
The Commission concluded, after going through a rule­
making proceeding that moved from a quantitative requirement to
the "prudent operator" standard, that existing certificates are
subject to this implied requirement, and they then defined ifc„
They said that the "standard encompasses the obligation to

and with all valid rules and regulations of any federal, state
or local government having jurisdiction, and the standard of
what a reasonably prudent operator would do with respect to the
drilling, completion, work over,

' completion or abandonment

of wells."
QUESTION:

I take it, the Commission's 'position is

that its view of the "prudent operator" standard is a nation/

wide one, and that it is independent of state law?
t

MR„ SHAPIRO:

The Commission's view as to the content

of the "prudent operator" standard, as, reflected in its order
— and I can take it no further than that at this time — is
that it does refer directly to state and local conservation laws,

11

For example* statutory* regulatory requirements of the state*
relating to production.
It also refers to the standard as adapted from the law
governing mineral leases between landowners and producers.
QUESTION:

Does it have any content other than what

it might have under the local law?

Does the federal law -- does

this rule now just pick up local law*whatever it might be?

Is

that the extent of it?
MR, SHAPIRO:

As far as the Commission has taken it*

it does make an obligation under the Natural Gas Act the same
duty that the producers are already under to conduct themselves

QUESTION:

As far as you can tell from the order* it

imposes no further duty than the state law does?
MR, SHAPIRO:

As far as the decision goes at present*

that is right,
QUESTION:

And so there might be a lot of different

duties* depending on what state you are in?
MR, SHAPIRO:

Producers would be operating locally

in different states and the nature of their duty might vary
locally as a result.

There may be some difference in conserva­
This is just an example of a federal law

referring to a state standard.
Now* the producers* themselves* in these proceedings*
argue that the Commission should not adopt any standard of

12

deiiverabilifey affecting their productioris, because they were
already subject to a "prudent operator" standard, and the
Commission concluded that they knew what the "prudent operator"
standard meant since they, themselves, were making this argument
and it adapted it to the federal obligation.
QUESTION:

But if the state had an allowable rule

about what the allowable production was, would the Commission -=>
Does this case suggest that the Commission can set a different
one?
MR® SHAPIRO:

Ho.

The Commission was quite careful

not to try and set up, as a result of this standard, any re­
quirement that would go beyond or go into conflict with what
the state required with respect to production.

Any valid state

production standard remains in effect today without regard to
the adoption of this standard.
a new standard.

It was not designed to set up

It was designed to apply under Section 7< the

operating standard that the producers are already under.
there was a reason for that.

Now,

They went to some length to avoid

conflict with the state law because, as this Court has inter­
preted, the production and gathering exclusion in Section 1(b),
it has often said that it applies to the physical activity of
i

producing gas, which is in the domain of the states.
The Commission is not trying to set itself up'as a

is trying to do Is to assure the maintenance of delivery under

13

Sac felon 7 under the Natural Gas Act.
QUESTION:

May I ask this question in that connection:

The word "develop" is used in the Commission's order*

The

exclusion from the jurisdiction of the Commission uses fche
word "production."

What's fche difference befcwean develop and

production* as a practical matter?
MR® SHAPIRO:

I don't know that for purposes of this

case we would have to treat them as significantly different*
The development the Commission refers to and the production
the Commission refers to is the development of dedicated,
acreage that is already subject to a service obligation under
fche Natural Gas Act.
been marketed.

In short* it is gas which has already

The acreage has been marketed and fche gas

producer has committed himself to — has undertaken fche obliga­
tion to supply gas to a pipeline.

He has to continue that

supply until he is authorized to abandon.

And if it is not

depleted*fche essence of fche Commission is he's got to at least
maintain enough production to meet his obligation to deliver
gas.
QUESTION:

When acreage is committed * does that mean

that all of the necessary drilling has been accomplished* or
does that lie ahead in fche future?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I think it sometimes means that there

will be additional development.

For example, I have seen refer-

ences — I have seen leases ~ not leases* but certificates with

14

underlying contracts in which the dedication* in effect* says*
"We dedicate all gas that will be produced on this acreage to
the service of some particular pipeline."
QUESTION:

Well* under this order* is it your view

that the Commission could say to a company that had dedicated*
say* a thousand acres„ "You aren't drilling enough holes to
accomplish the dellverability that we think is appropriate*
and you must accelerate the drilling of holes"
I suppose you would say?
MRa SHAPIRO:

or wells*

?

What the Commission would look to is

whether it would be prudent* under state standards* for the
operator to drill additional holes in order to meet his delivery
obligation»

However* these are questions which are somewhat

in the future.., since the Commission has gone no further here
and got no further than to announce what the standard would be.
QUESTION:

Well* Mr» Shapiro* suppose the law said

"Keep your nose out of production and gathering* even if it
serves some dellverability end»"

I suppose you would say then

Congress just said don't use this means of guaranteeing the
service obligation»

But you don't think the statute says that.

MR» SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No* Your Honor»

It says that production gathering is not

your business* but you say it is your business as long as it
serves a service obligation?
MR» SHAPIRO:

Yes* sir»

The analysis really is that

15
Section 1(b) -- anything that is within the affirmative grant
in Section 1(b)., of jurisdiction over sales* is not barred by
the production and gathering exclusion.

That's what the Court

has held in cases like Interstate Natural Gas Co. v. FPC* in 331.
The production and gathering exclusion doesn't take away what
it affirmatively granted . But if* as we and the Court have held*
the term "sales" includes a service obligation to deliver gas*
it necessarily has to include an obligation to produce enough
gas to deliver* because if there is no production there is no
delivery.

And if there is no —
QUESTION:

But that just leaves the exclusion out of

the Act.
MR. SHAPIRO:

It leaves in place the state's juris­

diction over the manner in which production will be conducted*
and —
QUESTION:

But it's enforceable.

The thing that is

excluded by the Act is then enforceable by the Commission; is
it not?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It does make the state standard a

reference.
QUESTION:

There Is some rational connection with

the service obligation.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

The consequence*otherwise* is to leave an enormous
gap in the regulatory scheme that Congress intended to fill.

16

QUESTION:

That may be so, bufc the Commission hadn't

discovered that enormous gap for quite a while.
MR. SHAPIRO:

The need for defining it, as I've

explained, became more and more urgent in the late '70s.
QUESTION:

Of course, it took quite some time for

there to be discovered any obligation over producers at all.
MRo SHAPIRO:

It took — It was 1954 before that was

fully developed and it was 1964 before Sunray.

So this has

been a process of gradual development.
Now, the point about the gap is that if you leave the
statute where the Court of Appeals has left it, producers retain
an unregulated choice as to whether to supply natural gas, be­
cause they can say, "We do not wish to produce."

If they let

What if some state dismantled its rules

We are just going to

We are not going to put them under

any conservation orders or anything else"?
Does that put you out of business in that state, as
far as any "prudent operator"

standard is concerned?

I think that in the absence of specific

conservation requirements, by statute and regulation within the
state, the Commission would lock to the general common law ap­
plicable to relationships among lessors and lessees, which also
implies a "prudent operator" standard and an obligation not to

QUESTION:

So* you suggest that as soon as the

Commission decides some state standard doesn't satisfy it* it
will go off on its own?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No* I think the Commission will look

to what are already valid state standards.

Now* the law pro­

vides* and this Court has held* that some state standards are
invalid* because they are irrational* because they are not related to conservation* because they seek to regulate price or
embargo shipment.

That kind of standard would be invalid* but

the Commission has attempted to coordinate its standard fully
otherwise.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hill.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES E. HILL* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER CONSUMER ENERGY COUNCIL OF AMERICA
MR. HILL:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
Cur basic contention in this litigation is that the
Commission has acted contrary to the terms cf the Natural Gas
Act* by adopting* as the standard and the exclusive standard
governing producer delivery obligations under the Act* a body
of state law which has been developed in the various producer
states for reasons altogether different than continuation of
steady and reliable supply of natural gas in interstate commerce.

18

There is, of course, also a fundamental jurisdictional
question here, that is, whether or not the Commission has the
authority to enforce those obligations which,it, in fact, cer­
tificated .
I would like to leave that jurisdictional question
largely to our briefs and to the argument of Mr« Shapiro, but
I would like to make one commente

That is a comment that

focuses on the distinction between what we say the Act requires
and \tfhat the Commission has done here.
We say the Act requires an extension of the pre­
visions or an application of the provisions of Section 4(d) and
Section 7(b) to significant declines in service.

That means

that the Commission would be interposed between the producer
and the ultimate consumer, and would pass upon the justification
for significant declines in delivery.

That also means that an

order from the Commission would not be in the form of an order
telling a producer to drill a particular well in this place or
take some action in some other place, which might be the case
under a "prudent operator" standard.

But the order that would

emanate from the Commission is basically the sort of order that
would emanate from the Commission when a producer currently
comes to the Commission and says, under 4(d), "We would like to
reduce service," or under 7(b)* !'W@ would like to have a partial
abandonment."
That is either a yes or a no, "We accept your

19

justification for a decline in service/' or "We don!t accept
that justification."
So* the orders that we conceive coming from the
Commission in the course of applying a proper delivery standard
will not embroil the Commission in o.uestions of where a particu­
lar well should be located or what action should be taken in
the field.
Now* this case takes its significance from the fact
that a bas« network of investment from that of the pipeline to
the end user, power plant* factory or consumer* has been built
upon the supply obligations under the Natural Gas Act.

And

these investments and the interests of those end users will be
placed significantly at risk if the Commission lacks the juris­
diction to enforce delivery obligations under the Act, or fails
to do so under a proper atandar<3.
It is clear from Section 4 and Section 7 of the Act
that one of the prime purposes of the Act is to insure a steady
and reliable service or supply of gas in the interstate market.
This Court has repeatedly recognized that purpose* as recently
as last May in the Southland decision* where the Court held
that the obligation to continue service* even in the face of
terms in a private agreement which may run contrary to that
obligation* was nevertheless essential to carry out the pur­
poses of the Act.
QUESTION:

We weren't up against any expressed

20

limitation on the Commission's jurisdiction either.
MR. HILL:

That's right, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTION:

And the question here is, I suppose, among

others, whether this rule, "prudent operator" rule is within the
production and gathering exclusion*
MR. HILL:

We would like to see that issue cast

slightly differently, and that is whether or not -QUESTION:

I don't blame you.

MR. HILL: — and that is whether or not the Commission
has the authority to utilize, and in fact is required to utilize
the provisions of Section 4{d) and 7(b) to significant declines
in service.
I don't want to defend jurisdictionally what the
Commission has tried to do here.
QUESTION:

You don't?

Suppose they haven't got the

jurisdiction to do what the Commission is doing.

Where does

that leave you?
MR. HILL:

Well, my hope is that the Court in de­

ciding that -*> I would hope that the Court would decide favorably
to the Commission on that issue, but then move on to our issue.
QUESTION:

So you are defending that?

MR. HILL:

In that sense, yes.

QUESTION:

You mean you just weren't going to defend

it in your argument?
ME. HILL:

That's right.

21

What the Commission has done here, and what
Mr* Shapiro clearly admits, is to adopt wholesale as the ex­
clusive federal standard a body of state law which has been
designed to do two things.

One, a body of state stautory and

regulatory law, which has been designed to place limits on
production in order to avoid waste, and another body of state
»

law which has been designed to govern the lessor-lessee agree­
ment .
1 hope that we have made clear in our brief^

page

39 to 41 of the initial brief and 12 to 15 of our second brief,
that the principles under each of those two bodies of law were
not designed to assure .a continuation of service and, in fact,
in various instances will militate against that purpose.
Therefore, we believe that the Commission has simply
violated the Act, or has not followed the Act's mandate by
adopting this body of state law.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hill, do you believe that some body

of lav; is implicit in the Act, such as Mr .Shapiro has said?
MR. HILL:

I believe that building upon this Court's

decisions in .Sunray and Southland .that there clearly are obliga­
tions to continue service under the Act, and that obligation
requires a producer, when he is’contemplating a significant
reduction

in service, to come to the Commission and say, "These

are the reasons that I cannot meet the production level that
I have been providing, and I i^ant the reduction in service under

22

Section 4(d) or to accomplish a partial abandonment under
Section 7(b) of the Act.-'
QUESTION:

But that isn’t the reason the Commission

gave, is it, for its Interpretive regulation?
MR, HILL:

Well, the Commission repeatedly refers to

the Sunray case and the Sun Oil case in Order 539-B

and

actually going back to Order 539# and they repeatedly rely
upon the Southland case in their briefs before this Court.
So they seem to think that those decisions give them
some authority, but they think that authority allows them to
reach out and grab a body of diverse state laws and use that
as the federal standard.
We say that those decisions don't authorize that
and that there is nothing in the Act or the legislative history
which would authorize that sort of step to develop a federal
service standard.
QUESTION:

But you say there is something,.either in

this Court's decisions or in the statute which authorizes the
development of some sort of a federal service standard?
MR, HILL:

That's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

clearly so.
QUESTION:

Clearly in the Act or clearly in this

C ourt *s d ec is ions ?
MRo HILL:

Well, I think it's found in between the

two and I think it becomes clear when one imagines the step

23

past Sun ray and Southland.
Shell Oil has argued here that the private contract
between the pipeline and producer contains no firm deliveryobligation,

In that case, one can imagine the next step in

the Sunray or Southland situation, where the producer says,
"Not that my contract has come to an end and, therefore, I
want to stop service, but that ray contract allows me to supply
whatever I want to supply at my discretion, and for that reason
I won’t even go to the Commission to get approval under 4(d)
or 7(b) for that reduction in service."
QUESTION:

Where does that leave the exclusion?

MR. HILLs

That leaves the exclusion, or the

operation of the exclusion in essentially the same place that
it is with respect to the Commission's current application of
4(d) or 7(h).

The Commission, currently, when a producer

comes in and says, "I would like to abandon this particular
field," listens to its justification and decides whether or
not that abandonment is in fact justified.

If it decides that

the abandonment is not justified, it issues an order that says,
"No, you shall continue to serve the interstate market."
All we are asking for and all we think the Act re­
quires is an application of that principle to the situation of
significant declines during the course of a contract, and during
the course of a certificate.
I might point out that in the Sunray case, at 364 U.S.

24

156* the Court explicitly referred to Section 4(d) of the Act*
in saying that its decision in that case did not make the
producer a captive of the Commission.

The producer always had

the opportunity to come to the Commission and ask for a reduc­
tion in service under Section 4(d) of the Act.
Now* we believe that there is a third reason why the
Commission’s activity here has run afoul of the Natural Gas Act]
and that is that what the Commission has essentially done by
adopting a body of state law is to pull the service obligation
out from under a firm federal standard under the Natural Gas
Act.
The Commission has resisted our efforts to point to
the FPO v. Texaco case in this regard, but we think that the
Commission has done essentially the same thing in the service
area here that it attempted to do there.

There it tried to

pull small producer rates out from under the regulatory scheme
of the Act and leave them to be governed by free market de­
cisions of the small producer and the pipeline involved.
Here* what the Commission has sought to do is to
pull service obligations out from under the Act* and allow those
service obligations to be governed by the free market decision
between the lessor and lessee.
As this Court Indicated in Texaco* that form of
price deregulation was not authorized by the Act.

I think

also this form of service deregulation is not authorized by

25

the Act,
Now# the Commission does not contest our position on
the merits.

The Commission does not claim that there is a

particular provision in the Act that authorizes this effort to
pick up a body of state law and have that be the delivery obii»
gation under the Act.

It doesn't point to anything in the legis­

lative history# and it doesn't really point to anything firm in
the decisions of this Court which would seem to authorize that
rather unusual effort to develop a federal service standard.
Indeed# there are a number of decisions of this
Court which have found very heavily upon that sort of patch»
work result.

And I might# as an aside# point out that at

page 17 of our reply brief we cite to a report which lays out
the various provisions of state law# and I think the Court from
looking at that -- that Commission report that we cite in the
Footnote on page 17

csm see that# in fact# state laws will

differ widely in terms of their obligations# the obligations
they place upon the producer on questions of allocation# on
questions of pooling# on questions of spacing.
So# what the Commission really is doing here is
adopting sort of a patchwork solution to the federal service
standard.
But# in any case# the Commission does not point to
anything in the Act# the legislative history or the decisions
of this Court which would seem to authorize this rather unusual

26

step in developing a federal service standard»
Rather, it says that the decision of the Commission
is due great deference from this Court.
Our first response to that is that whatever standard
this Court might apply, this standard, this effort is so far
beyond the reaches of the Act that it should be set aside.

But

I think the Court need not go that far in terms of applying a
deference standard.
What the Commission has said here is that it is interpreting the service obligations that flow from Section 7 of
the Act, and I believe that the Court of Appeals in the Fifth
Circuit fully recognized that at pages 3-A and 4-A of our
petition for certiorari, where we have reprinted the court's
opinion.

It is apparent that the court realized that what the

Commission was doing was engaging in an act of interpretation.
As such, under the past opinions of this Court, I don't believe
that that effort at statutory interpretation is due great deferenc e.
The Commission was not here exercising the sort of
authority that it has under Section 5 of the Act, which is
basically a legislatively delegated, rule-making function.

It

was simply engaging in statutory Interpretation.
Thus, the decision of this Court last tern in
National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting v. FCC, I think,
is inapposite, as are the other opinions which have been cited

27

by the Commission.
Under the proper standard or review* no undue defer­
ence is required here.TJn fact* seeing this ap an effort
V,

at statutory construction* it is important to note this is
neither a consistent nor a long-standing interpretation.

This

is not an interpretation that people have relied upon* as was
the case in Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train* which
was decided by this Court several years ago* and which has been
relied upon by the Commission»

Nor is it a decision that draws

heavily upon a great deal of experience from the Commission.
Because, as Mr» Shapiro has admitted* this constitutes* this
Order 539~*3 constitutes the Commission's first effort at inter­
preting or defining the service standard which flows from the
Act.

And* as such* in reaching out for this body of state law*

the Commission* in fact* justified its action simply by saying
that it was doing so because the producers had become acquainted
with it.
1 submit that that's hardly a sound basis for defer­
ence on the part of this Court to a decision of the Commission.
A question has been raised as to whether or not in­
terpreting the service obligation under the Act may pose some
problems of retroactivity»

I think what the Commission should

have done here, what the Commission says it did was to interpret
those obligations and, as in the Sun ray case* where again the
Commission was interpreting a certificate obligation which had

28

retroactive effect, that statutory interpretation, that defining
of the service obligation raises no retroactivity problem.
In addition, as long as the Commission adopts an
approach which allows the producer to come in and show jusfeification for declining reserves or declining deliveries, then I
think, further, there is no problem of confiscation or unfair­
ness to the producer.
So, in summary, we submit that the Commission has
acted beyond the authority granted' it in reaching out for this
body of state law and defining it as the federal service stan­
dard, that its position here deserves no great deference, and
that this Court should reverse the Court of Appeals' decision
and remand this action back to the Commission for further con­
sideration in light of the requirements of Section 7 and Section
4 of the Act.
Thank you.
MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Johnson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS Ge JOHNSON, ESQ..
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS SHELL OIL COMPANY, ET ALC
MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Thomas G. Johnson, representing Shell Oil
Company, and appearing here on behalf of the producer respon­
si ents,
In this case, the Court is again asked to reexamine

29

the distinction between production and gathering* which is ex­
cluded from the Commission’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas
Act and sale for resale* which is specifically Included.
For some twenty years* since this Court's decision in
Phillips* this distinction was thought to be clear by the in­
dustry and by the Commission.

And to read what the Court said

in Phillips* in this regard* 1 would like to quote the follow­
ing:

"In FPC v, Panhandle Eastern* we observed that the natural

and clear meaning of the phrase ^production or gathering of
natural gas* is that it encompasses the producing properties
and gathering facilities of the natural gas company."
Similarly* in Colorado Interstate Gas Company v,FPC*
we stated that transportation and sale does not include pro­
duction and gathering* and indicated that the production and
f r

gathering exemption applies to the physical activities* facili­
ties and properties used in the production and\ gathering of
natural gas.
In the Phillips case* the producer had argued that he
was in the business of producing and gathering natural gas and
that sale for resale was incidental to that business* and there­
fore was not subject to Commission jurisdiction.

The Commission

so found* but this Court disagreed and said that there was a
distinction between the physical activity* which the producer
was engaged in and was excluded from the Commission's juris­
diction* and the sale for resale* which was covered by Commission

30

jurisdiction.
In this case* the Commission makes exactly the op­
posite argument.

They argue that production is incidental to

the sale# and therefore the Commission must regulate production
in order to insure that the sale will continue.
That argument should be rejected for the same reason
that the producer's argument in Phillips was rejected# and
that reason is that it destroys the clear distinction imposed
by Congress between production# gathering and sale for resale.
The only other case which this Court has d*alt v/ith
the distinction between production and gathering and sale is
IGI v. Continental Oil Company# the Rayne Field case.

And#

there again# the Court reiterated this distinction in this
language:

"We conclude that even though a sale of natural gas

in Interstate commerce occurs before production or gathering is
ended# it is nonetheless subject to regulation." In the context
of such a sale, as distinguished from the situation in FPC v.
Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co.# to be discussed hereafter# the
production or gathering exemption relates to the physical activi­
ties# processes and facilities of production or gathering# but
not to sales of the kind affirmatively subject to Commission
jurisdiction.
This accommodation of the two relevant clauses of
Section l{b)# gives content to the national objectives of the
Natural Gas Act# as expounded in Phillips# and to the Commission's

31

jurisdiction to accomplish them* while in no way interfering
with the state regulatory power over the physical processes of
production or gathering,in furtherance of conservation or other
legitimate state concerns.
We believe.. Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the reason
why the Commission had never sought to exercise jurisdiction
over production activities prior to this case was that those
activities were actively being regulated by the states.

This

was the case even before the Natural Gas Act was passed in 1938.
As early as 1931a this Court, in Champiin Refining Company v.
Corporation Commission, affirmed the power of the states to
regulate production activities.
This places this distinction under another line of
cases by this Court, led by Panhandle Eastern v. Public Service
Commission, which held that the Congress in passing the Natural
Gas Act Intended to fill the regulatory gap, which this Court
had held in the Attleboro and Missouri v. Kansas gas cases,
the states had no power to regulate.
QUESTION:

Mr. Johnson, aren’t the states still

regulating?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, sir, they are, Your Honor, and we

don’t believe there is any gap in the regulation.
QUESTION:

There wasn’t any gap with respect to just

production and gathering.
MR. JOHNSON:

We believe. Your Honor, that the states

32

are regulating production activities* and,as I understand,that
was the distinction that the Court made in Phillips and Rayne
Field cases.
QUESTION:

Yes, but at the time the Natural Gas Act

was passed, there wasn't any gap with respect to production
and gathering, was there?
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

No, and —

I mean, had it been held that the Inter­

state Commerce Commission forbad the states from regulating
production and gathering?
MR. JOHNSON:
that.

No, sir.

I think the states were doing

Yes, sir, that's my point.
QUESTION:

I thought you were saying that the reason

the Commission never got around to this until 1976 was because
the states were actively regulating.
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, and they still are, Your Honor.

My question is, why did they get around

to it in '76 if the states haven't ceased regulating?
MR. JOHNSON:
answering that question.

We have a great deal of difficulty
We don't think they should have.

The Commission argument that regulation —
QUESTION:

Didn't change in the market price have

something to do with it?

I mean the ratio between the inter-

state price and the intrastate price -MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor, we believe that this whole

33
proceeding is a result of an erroneous assumption on the part
of the Commission and the consumer advocates that producers
will not produce their gas unless the Commission makes them
do it.

We believe that that argument defies reason* because

the only source of income that a producer has is the gas which
he Droducee.
QUESTION:

Yes* but isn't it conceivable that he can

get a higher amount of Income by selling in the local market
rather than selling in interstate commerce?
MR0 JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Your Honor* that argument —

Theoretically possible* at least.

MRo JOHNSON:

-- was made before the Commission and

the Court of Appeals prior to the enactment of the Natural Gas
Policy Act in November of last year.

I do not believe it is

any longer possible* because the Natural Gas Policy Act fixes
a ceiling price for intrastate sales as well as interstate
sales.

So that* if there ever was any incentive on the part

of a producer to withhold gas to receive a higher price* that
was removed by the Natural Gas Policy Act,
The consumers make the argument that there are dif­
ferent categories of gas under that Act* and that the producers
may somehow adjust gas between those categories.
We submit that s not true.

7

We think Congress went

to great lengths to avoid that very thing* and they provided
as nearly as they could that producers must continue to produce

34
gas from existing fields* from existing wells and they can't
get any higher price for it,
QUESTION:

Of course* the regulation was adopted

before the '78 statute was passed.
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

That's right.

What I am saying is --

Do you rely entirely on the '78 statute

for your -MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

No* sir.

Well* if we look at it without regard to

the '78 statute* Is it not possible at the time the regulation
was passed that a producer might have had an economic motive
for desiring to get out of federal regulation* be free to sell
on the local market?

It is at least theoretically possible*

isn't it?
MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor* the problem, with that theory

is that once a producer has dedicated his gas to interstate
commerce* he must continue to deliver that gas in interstate
commerce.

We don't contest that.
QUESTION:

The problem

Couldn't you have a problem* say* if you

drilled another well or made a capital investment of some kind?
You might get a return on your investment at the local price*
but not get a return on your investment at the interstate price?
So* if you are stuck with the interstate market* you just
wouldn't make the investment.
MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor* this Court held in Sun ray --

35
and we don't challenge -- that once the gas from a particular
field is dedicated to interstate commerce through a contract
and a certificate, the producer can't remove that gas.

He

can't drill another well to that same field, under that same
lease and sell it anywhere else.
interstate purchaser.
QUESTION:

That's what the law says.
Not if he gets abandonment approval.

MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

He has to sell it to the

Yes, but the Commission --

Isn't it possible that at one set price

level you could get abandonment approval, by not making further
capital improvement?

I don't know, but it seemed to me it was

theoretically possible.
MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor, I believe the Commission's

practice has been consistent, over the last fifteen years, of
universally denying abandonment in any situation where the well
will continue to produce.

So, I don't think it is a practical

answer to say that the Commission would grant abandonment and
allow the producer to sell somewhere else.

As a practical

matter, they don't do that.
QUESTION:

What is your real objection to the present

regulation of the Commission?
MRa JOHNSON:

Our real objection, Your Honor, is that

the Commission is seeking in this proceeding to second-guess
the production decisions of the producers.
this way.

They come about in

Keep in mind that a gas field is continually declining

36
In production.

That's the problem with the standard which says

the producer must maintain service, because that's usually
physically impossible for the producer to do, because the gas
field is continually declining and the ability of the wells to
produce is continually being reduced.
Now, the question is whether the producer can do
something, at some point in time, to delay that decline or
defer the loss of production from these wells.
very difficult questions,

And those are

The question usually comes out:

If a well loses production, can that production be restored by
drilling a new well, or can it be restored by installing pumping
facilities to remove the water which has encroached and choked
off the gas, or can explosives or acid be used to increase the
permeability of the well?
And all of these things are decisions requiring
expert judgment.
We think if the effect of this decision is that the
Commission supervises all of those production decisions that
the producers will be embroiled in litigation before the
Commission repeatedly in an attempt to justify their production
decisions.

We think that's going to detract from the search

for new gas supply,which is the only way that the gas supply
can really be increased.
QUESTION:

Ycu think you can live with the state

authorities, but you don't want another level of regulations?

37
MKo JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Do you accept the Commission's statement*

or representation here* that the rule they have adopted seeks
only to implement what each specific state would implement?
MRo JOHNSON:

1 would answer that in two ways* Your

Honor*
I think the Commission is caught in a dichotomy.

They

say* on the one hand* that there is a gap in regulation* and yet
they say that the state regulation is adequate over production
facilities.

And we certainly do not contest that once the gas

is produced we must continue to deliver it to the interstate
purchaser.
So* if that is the Commission's position* then there
is certainly no regulatory gap.
If the Commission's position* on the other hand* is
that there is a regulatory gap* then they must be saying there
is something wrong with the state regulation over production
activity and we intend tc change it.

We don’t know what those

changes will consist of.
QUESTION:

I suppose even if the Commission agrees

that there was no gap and you believed them* you would still
object to another level of regulation?
MR0 JOHNSON:

Yes* Your Honor* vie believe it is un­

necessary arid we believe it conflicts with the intent of Congress
when they enacted the Natural Gas Act* because we think the

38
Congress Intended to leave that regulation over production
activities to the states.
It is difficult to see what more the producer can be
required to do than what he is required to do under the state
standards, which is to operate with due diligence and as a
reasonably prudent operator under the circumstances of case.
He certainly can't be required to maintain service from the gas
fields where the gas has already all been produced.

So, the

simple explanation which the consumer advocate proposes is
an impractical one, because if the field will no longer maintain service, the question the Commission or any regulatory
body has to answer is:

Why?

And if the reason why is that the gas is depleted,
then there is nothing the producer or anybody else can do about
it.

It is only if the producer has been negligent or has not

operated his lease properly that the regulatory body takes some
action.
QUESTION:

I would like to address your attention to

the example the Commission gives in its reply brief, wheret
assume you are extremely negligent, don't make elementary
repairs or maintenance or anything and your supply, therefore,
terminates.

Do they have authority to prevent that?

MR» JOHNSON:
this way.

Your Honor, I'll answer the question

First of all, we think that example is completely

contrary to reason.

It doesn't make any sense for a producer

39
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars drilling a gas well
and then refuse to spend the few dollars necessary to maintain
that well, if his only source of income is coming from that well.
Now, we think that the dividing line is this -QUESTION:

But supposing they did it?

MR„ JOHNSON:

Let me say what I think the Commission

can do and what I think they can't do.
QUESTION:

I don't mind as long as eventually you

tell me what the answer
MHo JOHNSON:

is to the qr.estion.
I am sorry.

I didn't intend to avoid

the question.
QUESTION:

The question is:

thetical the Government has posited.

Assume the third hypo­
Do they have regulatory

jurisdiction to step in in that particular case?
MR„ JOHNSON:

We believe that the Commission does

not have regulatory jurisdiction to require the producer to
make additional capital investment,
QUESTION:

How about ordinary maintenance?

That's the

example they give. "Undertake... the most elementary maintenance
of its production facilities, so they fall into disrepair, with
the result that production and hence deliveries cease."
Now, you say that's absurd to think that would ever
happen,
My question Is:

Assuming it did happen, would the

Commission have statutory power to say, "No, you've got to do

40

some maintenance work"?
MR, JOHNSON:

1 think they would, Your Honor, because

the Court of Appeals below said this.

They said that the

Commission has the power to require producers to continue
deliveries where the wells are capable of producing in paying
quantities.
Now* if the wells are capable of producing in paying
quantities, even given some minor maintenance operation, we
believe the Commission could require that that be done.
Now, what we don't believe, however, is that the
Commission can require new wells to be drilled or that capital
expenditures can be —
QUESTION:

How do we know the Commission is going to

require anything more than this in interpreting this regulation?
MR, JOHNSON:

Your Honor, that's what they said in

their order.
QUESTION:

That they are going to require you to drill

new wells?
MR, JOHNSON:
QUESTION:
they?

Yes, sir.

They said they would consider that, didn't

Questions with respect to that were reserved, weren't

they?
MR, JOHNSON:

Yes, what the Commission said was that

"if we find it necessary to maintain service, we are going to
require producers to drill new wells or take whatever measures

41

we find are necessary to maintain the service.,"
That's what the Commission's Order 539-B says.
QUESTION:

The Commission has told us the other day

that it assumes it has the power to do that under this order.
I understood Mr. Shapiro to say that.

He said they hadn't

decided whether they would# but that they have the power under
this order.

If there any argument about that?

MR. -JOHNSON:

Your Honor# it seems to me that if they

are arguing that they have the power and under the Order they
intend to exerc .se that power at some point in time# they very
carefully avoided any discussion of how this jurisdiction will
be exercised.
QUESTION:

They didn't say just reserve the exercise#

but assert the power?
MR, JOHNSON:

I think that's right# Your Honor.

But our point is that in discussing whether or not
they have the power# the Court should consider how the power
should be exercised# is going to be exercised»

And if it is

going to be exercised in a way that interferes with the state
jurisdiction over production activities# then we think it con­
flicts with the jurisdiction of the state and exceeds Commission
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I am surprised you answered Mr. Justice

Stevens with a "yes" on his hypothetical.
production and gathering.

It is just as much

Negligent production and gathering

is negligent production and gathering.

It is still production

and gathering.
QUESTION:

And I thought your whole position was that

within the exclusion there was no power in the Commission.
MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor* I think our position is that

the Commission has no power to control the production and
gathering activity.
I understood Mr. Justice Sevens' question to be
limited to a fact situation where it would simply be a matter
of turning the valves back on* or to -QUESTION:
isn't it?

That's still production and gathering*

Where did they get the power to do that?
MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor* I would be very content

if this Court would hold -QUESTION:

I know* but you were asked what your

position was* and you seemed to say construe the Act to permit
the Commission to do that.

You apparently agree with the

Court of Appeals.
MR. JOHNSON:

I agree with the Court of Appeals when

the Court of Appeals said that if the well is capable of pro­
ducing in paying quantities* that the Commission has the power
to make those wells — to require the producer to deliver the
gas.

In other words* if the producer just turns the valve.
QUESTION:

And to engage in some activity that would

make the producer have the wells live up to their potential.

43
Isn’t that production and gathering?
MR» JOHNSON:

I certainly think if the Commission

requires anything affirmative on the part of the producer to
produce the wells, that it is production and gathering and would
be excluded from their jurisdiction,
* ■ >

I think the difference and the dividing line is the

question of whether or not something more is required than
simply turning a valve,»,or whether the Commission is seeking to
require the producer to actually, in some way, control its
production operations.

And we believe that is what is excluded

from Commission jurisdiction under the Acte
QUESTION:

Mr. Johnson, aren't we talking about

situations where reserves have been dedicated under contracts,
say, with natural gas pipeline companies?

Aren't there contracts

obligating producers to deliver gas to the pipelines?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor, the contracts obligate

the producer to deliver all of the gas which is produced -*and that's important -- which is produced from a certain field.
QUESTION:

Right, but let me follow that up.

Suppose

a producer was manifestly negligent, as suggested in the hypo­
thetical that you and Mr. Justice Stevens have been discussing,
would the party to that contract, say the natural gas pipeline
company, have a cause of action under the terms of the contract
for failure to perform as required by the contract itself?
MR a JOHNSON:

If the contract did require that the --

44
QUESTION:

Do these contracts require?

MR, JOHNSON:

Normally, they do not, Your Honor,

because the production decisions in the contracts are normally
reserved to the producer.

And the pipeline is not the body

that polices the producer's actions in those matters.

It is

the state agencies and the lessors in state proceedings which
assure that the producer will proceed diligently.
QUESTION:

If you represented a pipeline company that

had a contract for the delivery of natural gas and you found
out the producer was just not spending a nickel on maintenance
and repairs and, therefore, couldn’t fulfill the contract, you
would take no action?
MR. JOHN-SON:

Your Honor, first, as I said before,

I think that's not a realistic example.
QUESTION:

i

I agree with that, but --

MR. JOHNSON:

Assuming that the pipeline did have

— that that was the situation, I think it would depend on
whether the contract gave the pipeline that power or whether
the contract simply said that the pipeline had the right to
buy the gas if, as and when produced ;
QUESTION:

as many of them do,

In any event, the royalty holder would

have some interest?
MR. JOHNSON:

The royalty owner would certainly

vigorously prosecute the producer.
QUESTION:

And it is almost guaranteed that he would

45
have the power under his lease.
MR* JOHNSON:

There is not any question about that*

sir.

I

Your Honor* if I could close with just one sentence*
we believe that the Commission is seeking to assert jurisdiction
in an area which is precluded from assertion by Congress* and
we think the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

further* Mr. Shapiro?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E, SHAPIRO* K8Q. *
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
MR. SHAPIRO:
^

One very brief statement* Your Honor.

First* the states do not require production in aid
of interstate delivery obligations under the Natural Gas Act.
That is the regulatory gap.
Second* the producers have stated the obligation is
to deliver only what they choose to produce.

If they choose

not to produce or they choose not to maintain their equipment*
there will be no gas to deliver.

Hence* there is no delivery

And that will destroy the — or seriously under»

mine the dedication concept recognized in Sun ray and subsequent
1

cases.
QUESTION:

Do you mean there will be no contract

delivery obligation?
MR. SEAPXRQ:

There will be no delivery obligation

46
under the statute, Your Honor, because the contract obligation
is not what controls under the Natural Gas Act, but the service
obligation resulting from the certification of the sale.

That's

the doctrine of summary.
QUESTION:

You are conceding that if they deliberately

don't maintain their equipment they don't have any obligation?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No, no.

You are saying what's their view of the

statute?
MR. SRAPIRO:

I am sorry.

I misunderstood your

question.
There remains a duty under the statute to deliver.

The Court of Appeals, rather inconsistently, said —
this is in the Petition, page 7~a -- "The FERC can enforce
'service obligations' contained In the certificates that it
Issues to producers, preventing producers from ceasing deliveries
from fields admittedly capable of continuing production."
Now, the word "admittedly," I assume refers to ad~
mifefced by the producer, but if, in fact, the field can produce,
and all that is required is the ordinary prudent action to keep
it producing, then what the Commission is saying here is simply

that they should take those steps to assure that they produce

of the "prudent operator" standard.
