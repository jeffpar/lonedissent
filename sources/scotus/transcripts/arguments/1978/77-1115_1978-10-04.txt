MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 77-1115, Robert Lai'.Li against Rosamond La Hi.
Mr. Henkin, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD M. HENKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HENKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a second appeal from the Court of Appeals
of the State of New York.

On the first appeal, this Court

vacated the judgment and sent the case back for a reconsidera­
tion in the light of your decision in Trimble v. Gordon.
Thereafter, the Court of Appeals, by a vote of five to two,
disregarded the directive of this Court and attempted to
distinguish the New York statute involved, which brought us
back to you.
This statute, which is the state’s Powers and Trust
Law, Section 4-1.2, requires an order of filiation to be ob­
tained within two years after the birth of an illegitimate
child, during the lifetime of the father, before the child
can participate in distribution of the estate of his natural
father.
The Attorney General indicates that he does not
concede the facts.

However, the Court of Appeals, in its first

opinion, clearly states that the facts in this case are

4
uncontested.
The decedent was killed in 1974.
his widow, is not here on this appeal.

The Respondent,

The only one who is

in opposition here is the Attorney General of the State of
New York*

even though she has a bond in the sum of $100,000

which was required to be put at the time that she obtained
the letters jpf administration.
of wedlock.

The Appellant was born out

It is conceded that no order of filiation was

obtained „
QUESTION:

How old was the Appellant at the time of

his father's death?
MR. HENKIN:
QUESTION:

He ‘was about 26 or 28.
Much older than 2 years old,

MR. HENKIN:

Much older than 2 years old, Your

Honor.
I may say that at that time there was, no procedure
in New York -- at the time the father died -- whereby the
father could bring a proceeding in order to have the child
declared legitimate.

That statute was enacted thereafter,

after the father died.
There is no marriage claimed to have taken place
between his natural parents.

The Appellant was acknowledged

by the decedent as his son in writing, duly acknowledged
before a notary public,

And during the lifetime of the

decedent they were living together prior to the time that

5
natural mother of the infant died and the natural father was
supporting the mother and the infant and his si3ter0
QUESTION;

In full?

MR, HENKIN:

Originally, in full, but shortly before

he dled, the son, having reached the age of majority, was
working for the father in his business, soothe father sup­
ported him In part»
QUESTION;

So, it is your position that he supported

him entirely as long as he was a minor?
MR „ HENK IN;
QUESTION;

Tha t1 s c o rresc t.
Under New York law, could the decedent

Everybody in this case is named Lalli.
That is correct* Your Honor.

That was Eileen's son by another man.

MR, HENKIN:
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:

No* Your Honor.
Is there a reason why it 'wasn't?
Apparently* there is no birth certi­

ficate* that we know of* for Robert.

We do know that there

is an acknowledgement which is in the record* wherein the
father says -- although he could have said, "my ward," he
says* "my son*" in giving consent to a marriage of Robert.
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:

Was he born in New York?
He was born In New York.

QUESTION: And you can’t find a birth certificate In
New York?
MR. HENKIN:

MR. HENKIN:

He may have a birth certificate* we

There is none in fche record.
Did anybody look for one?

MR. HENKIN:
QUESTION:

We have not looked for one. Your Honor»
Mr, Henkin, I fchink, in your briefs you

MR, HENKIN:
QUESTION:
MR, HENKIN:

No, we do not.
On fche ground, what, fchafc its -We feel fchafc that case is not appli­

cable to this situation, in view of Gordon v, Trimble.

We

feel that the gist of the decision in Gordon v„ TrImb 1 e is
that where fche proof of paternity is clear, as in instances
given by the Court in Gordon v. Trimble, no requirement
should be interposed by statute on fche right of an illegiti­
mate child fco participate in the estate,
QUESTION:

Then you think fchafc T r imb lev. Go rd on

MR, HENKIN:

To fchafc extent, yes,"

QUESTIONAlthough ifc didn't say so in so many
words.
MR, HENKIN:

That is correct, Your Honor,

We also feel »QUESTION:

Could I ask you one more question, then

I'll stop.
What are we talking about here?

It "is totally

irrelevant here, but are we talking about much money or aboufc

8
very little* as was the case in the Trimble case?
MR. HENKIN:

No* in this case* we have a bond of

over $100*000»
(Whereupon* a three-minute recess was taken due
to microphone trouble»)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now* you may proceed*

Mr. Henkin* 2 think we are functioning again.
MR, HENKIN:
QUESTION:

Thank you. Your Honor.
Before you start* could you clear up

something I had missed in the briefs.

You mentioned two or

three times Mrs. La 111, the original Respondent, Is no
longer party to the case, in effect.
MR. HENKIN:

Is the case moot?

She did not: appear in this Court,

she filed no brief and she is not represented by her
attorney at this time.

The only one who is appearing in

opposition to us is the Attorney General of the State of
New York.
QUESTION:

The case hasn't been settled, or anything

like that, has it?
MR. HENKIN:
Honor,

No, it has not been settled* Your

She just did not appear.

She did not file any brief

and she did not appear at all after we filed the notice of
appeal for the second time,
QUESTION:

Would you tell me one other thing.

I am

not sure I understood your answer to Mr, Justice Blackmun.

9
He asked you whether fenera was a lot of money involved or
a small amount.,
bond posted,
question,

You answered by saying there is $100,000

I don't really know how that answers the

Does that mean there is a lofc of money or nofc much

money?
MRo HENKIN:

We claim that there is over $100,000

involved in this estate,

We also claim that there is death

course of action which he did not follow up and to which we
say we are entitled to under counsel,
QUESTION:

I see.

So there is a substantial amount

of money,
MR, HENKIN:

There is a substantial amount of money

involved in this case.

What the actual amount is involved

we will find upon the accounting if one is ordered by this
Court,

And this is what we are seeking and that's where we

were stopped by the court below, Surrogate Court* dismissing
our obligation for an accounting.
QUESTION:

Mr. Henkin* if your client had been a

legitimate son — let’s say a father and mother married and
had one child* under the laws of intestate succession in
New York* upon the father's death* does the mother get twothirds and the child one-third?
MR, HENKIN:

If he was the only child* he would get

one-third — or one-half* rather.

If there were more than

one child* if there were two children* they would get

10
two-thirds and the mother one third.

But the mother of this

child wag dead. The Respondent is not the mother of the
Appellant,

She is the widow of the decedent.

She was ap~

pointed Administratrix as his widow.
QUESTION:

I see.

In that situation, if this had

been a legitimate child, under the laws of New York* how
would the decedent's estate have been shared?
MR, HENKIN:

One-third to her and two-thirds to the

two children.
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:

There is another child?
There is another child.
A legitimate child?
No, illegitimate child also.

But the

one that I represent and the one who made an application and
is the Appellant is one of the two children.
QUESTION: One of the two illegitimate children.
MR, HENKIN:

Right.

In addition to our argument that this case is
controlled by the decision in Trimble v, Gordon, by the fact
that this, acknowledgement in writing,acknowledged before a
notary., which is one of the grounds specified in Note 14 to
the gist of the decision, considering the language immediately
preceding that note in the text,

we say that under the New

York law, Section 24 of the Domestic Relations Law, creates
two classes of illegitimacy,*

those whose natural parents

11

went through a marriage ceremony before or after their birth.,
no matter how invalid is that marriage.

Because that section

specifically says that if the natural parents of an infant
marry., regardless of how invalid that marriage is., that child
is a legitimate child of both its parents who went through
that marriage ceremony.
We say to you that, consequently, although the Court
of Appeals completely ignored our argument to that respect,
that section when contrasted with Section 4-1,2 of the
Decedents Estate Law creates entirely a different class of
illegitimates.

As to those as to whom there was s carriage

ceremony, even though invalid, they are entitled to inheret.
But because our client's parents complied with the Mew York
statute and did not marry, our child, our Appellant is denied
the right to participate in his father's estate.

Because as

to him the bar of Section 4-1.2 Is Interposed and is he is
held to be illegitimate.
And I say to Your Honors that this‘-particular
distinction into those two classes by virtue of those two
sections has absolutely no logic or reason and absolutely
is discriminatory and denies my client equal protection of
the law,
QUESTION:

Your client could have had all the

protection you now seek without his parents being married if
he — if the natural father

-- had complied with the

-r-

12

statutory requirement; is that not so?
MR. HENKIN:
pleases.

He could not do it, if Your Honor

He could not comply with the statutory requirements

because this particular section which is cited in the opinion*
in the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals* on the
second appeal* pursuant to your referral* was not in effect
until long after the father died.

At the time the father

was living* there was no such section* and if there was any
attempt made by the father to bring a proceeding, to get an
order of filiation* such an application would have been denied*
as it was denied in Matter of Rickey M, v. Sharon. R. t 49
Appellate Division* 2d* 1035«

And it couldn't be done at

that particular time.
QUESTION:

Mr. Henkin* you said a moment ago that

your father and mother here compiled with the New York law
and didn't marry.

Would you explain what you meant by that.

MR. HENKIN:

Because the father had a wife living at

the time* who is the widow* the Respondent in this case who
does not appear on this appeal,
QUESTION:

So he would have been guilty of bigamy

had he married.
MR. HENKIN:

That is correct* but the statute*

Section 24 of the Domestic Relations Lax*;*specifically gays
that* regardless of the validity of the marriage* even if
the marriage is not valid* even if the marriage is absolutely

no good fran its inception* any child born before or after
is a legitimate child of those people who went through a
marriage ceremony* if they are the parents of that child*
without any proof whatsoever being required of compliance
with another affiliation or any other requirement.

The fact

of marriage as to those children* even a bigamous marriage*
is sufficient to make them legitimate.

Whereas* as to all

other children where there was no marriage* bigamous or
otherwise* there is* under the Mew York statute* an absolute
requirement that at two years of age a child should go -or his parents should go and make an application for an
order of filiation.

Because if that order of filiation

is not applied within two years

after the child is born*

regardless* even if there was such a situation as we have in
the TrIrob 1 e v . Gordon case* that particular child* no appli­
cation having been made within twc years* would not be given
a right to participate in the eatate*because that is the
provision of the statute.
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:

But he could still draw a will.
Yes* Your Honor.

But in Gordon v.

Trimble* this Court said that the will does not have to be
drawn* and that that fact* that no will has been drawn*has
no constitutional significance as to the right of the child.
QUESTION:

Your client also challenged the two-year

provision of the New York Filiation Law, did it not* in a

14

separate attack?
MR, HENKIN:
appeals.

We raised that question in both our

The Court of Appeals said that because there is no

question that no order of filiation was ever entered — wg don't
claim that such an order was entered ■— we should not attack
the two-year provision.
But we say to Your Honors even if at the age of 15
he got an order of filiation -- assuming he did get such an
order, it wouldn’t have helped him because he couldn't
participate in any -«
QUESTION:

Except that you could have challenged the

statute on that ground, that you did challenge on but it
wasn't passed on by the Court of Appeals.
MR. HENKIN:

We are challenging the statute on the

ground of Gordon v. Trimble and also because Section 24 of
the Decedents Estate law created two classes of illegitimates,
without any distinction between them except the fact of
marriage.
And we say to you that just because the marriage
did not take place, the New York statute requires to get an
order of filiation, which is discriminatory.
QUESTION:

In Trimble, hadn't there been a judicial

determination prior to the death of the father?
MR. HENKIN:
QUESTION:

There was a judicial determination.
Not here?

15
MRo HENKIN:

In this case, there wasn't, but under

Note 17, this Court said that it is not necessary to have
judicial determination, an acknowledgement is sufficient,
under Note 17, to have the same effect as the judicial
determination.
QUESTION:

But the fact; is that there was a judicial

determination in Trimble.
MR. HENKIN;

Yes, that is correct.

There was none

In this particular case.
I would say that where the proof is such that it
Is clear that there Is no issue of paternity, such as here
where there is an acknowledgement and support, that there
is no requirement to have a judicial determination, because
this is going from the middle ground,that the Court spoke
of in Gordon v. Trimble.to the extreme of requiring Judicial
determination within two years after the birth of the child,
and no child could have been that smart to get that determina­
tion at that age, or to have the parents of a child who are
living in-peace together to go and apply, all of a sudden,
where the man is supporting the woman and the children, for
her to go and apply for an order of filiation. Accordingly,
(?)

Mr, Justice Cook and Mr. Justice Felsberg said, "This will
be serving only to break up the family for a mere formality,"
where there is no reason why the child should have such order
applied for.

Because where the father is voluntarily

16

supporting his children* then there is no reason to make a
court application.

Accordingly* the children of the in­

voluntary parent* or involuntary father* will be benefited*
but the children of the voluntary father who is supporting
them* will be denied their right, to support and their right
to distribution as to their estates.
QUESTION:

What’s the widow's position in all this?

She is taking the position that this is not a child of the
decedent?
MR, HENKIN:

That was her original position* but

she admitted on the first appeal to the Court of Appeals
that the issue involved* ras to whether or not a child could
participate — that was the point of their making their first
appeal* when we first went before this Court.
QUESTION:
misunderstand you.

Mr. Henkin* I want to be■sure I didn't
Do I correctly understand that you tell

us the decedent could not in fact or in law have secured a
certification of filiation during his lifetime?
MR. HENKIN:

That is correct* Your Honor* because

Section 522 of the Family Court Act was amended to permit
such an application to be made by laws of 1976* Chapter 665*
taking effect as of January 1977.
QUESTION: So that* during his lifetime* he could not
have secured an order of filiation?
MR. HENKIN:

And if he made such an application during

17

his lifetime* under the Matter of Rickey M»and Sharon R»,
49 Appellate Division* 2d* 1035» such application would have
been denied,
QUESTIONs
MR. HEM IN:
QUESTION:
MR, HENKIN:

Is that case in your brief?
No* It is not* Your Honor,
Gould you give me that citation again.
Matter of Rickey M, v, fSharon R, * 49

Appellate Division* 2d* 1035* 1975 case.
QUESTION:
MR. HENKJlN:

Mr. Henkin* why would it be denied?
Because there was no provision in the

statute at that time for the father to make such application.
The statute was amended only in 1976.
QUESTION:

You mean up until 1976 in New York —

that must have been the last state.
MR. HENKIN:
QUESTION:

This man v;as killed in 1974.
I mean New York didn’t get around to

letting children inherit from their fathers until 1976*
wouldn't that make New York the last state to do it?
MR, HENKIN:

You are talking with reference to the

children born before that time?
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:

Yes,
That's why we are here* claiming that

the statute is unconstitutional,
QUESTION:
they?

But the child or mother can apply* can't

18

MHo HENKIM:

Yes, the nother could apply»

But

the mother didn't apply because they were living together
as one family»

There was no reason for it.

QUESTION:

So your statement Is really a very

technical one, that the father couldn't apply»

Certainly,

a proceeding could have taken place in which the father
could have admitted —
MB» HENKXN:
did not support her.

If the mother applied, if the father
And also, she had to apply only within

two years after the birth of the child.

The Attorney General

says, in Gordon v» Trimble, if that case arose after the
statute of the State of Mew York, that child, because there
was adjudication, would have been entitled to inherit.
We respectfully submit to you that that is not the
cose, because the New York statute required that that appli­
cation be made only within the first two years after the
child was born.
QUESTION:

The New York Court of Appeals, in its

opinion at A2, in this case, says that"under our New York
statute, the right to inherit depends only upon proof that
a court of competent jurisdiction has made an order of
filiation declaring paternity during the lifetime of the
father»5’
MR, HENKIN:
QUESTION:

That is not correct.
Well, we are not going to second guess

19

the New York Court of Appeals on what Mew York law is.
MR* HENKIM:

If Your Honor pleases, the statute Is

printed in the record and it is in my brief, and the language
of that statute Is very clear.
QUESTION;

"Has to be made during the pregnancy of

the mother or within two years from the birth of the child«"
MR. HENKIM;
QUESTION;
MR. HENKIM;

Right.

That is correct.

That's what the statute says.
That's exactly what the statute says.

As a matter of fact* I think there is a note somewhere that
they didn't reach that point.
QUESTION:

You mean the: Court of Appeals doesn't

have advance sheets?
MR. HENKIN:

The decision of the Court of Appeals

— the opinion of the Court of Appeals, if Your Honor pleases,
is printed — the first one In Appendix A in the Jurisdictional
Statement, 75-11^8.
QUESTION;

You do say that an order of filiation

could have been secured under New York lav,; at the behest of
somebody other than the natural father, during the natural
father's lifetime?
’ MR. HENKIM;
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN;
application

Yes.
That is by the mother, the natural mother?
The natural mother could have made the

20

QUESTION:

Or anybody else?

MR* HENKIN:

The child?

The child , yes — two-year old child

who could possibly do it* if he were smart enough at the age
of two to do so.
QUESTION:

But you say that as a matter of practical

fact the natural mother wouldn't have done it* and why was
that?
MR, HENKIN:

The natural mother would not have done

it because she was living together with the father and he
was supporting her and the children,
QUESTION:

Was she his sister-in-law?

MR. HENKIN:
QUESTION:

No.
Her name was lalli* too* wasn't it?

MR. HEMIN:

Her name was Lalli because she was

living with Mr. Lalli»

That was her name by pregnancy.

They were maintaining the household.

He bought her a house

where she lived together with the tv?o children of this
particular — what shall I say* relationship — and in
addition the child born to her by prior marriage — by prior
relationship with some other man.
QUESTION:
MR. HENKIN:

And where was Mrs, Lalli all this time?
Bhe was living in another house.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP IRWIN M. ETRUM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR» ETRUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The New York statutory scheme does not discriminate
against illegitimates inheriting either from their mother or
father.

It merely provides in fch€' case, where an illegitimate

Is claiming through his father, that there be an order of a
New York court determining parentage made during the lifetime
of the father.
While the statute does refer to a two-year require­
ment, the New Yorkccourfcs have not enforced that two-year
requirement.

In the brief filet] by the Attorney General,

there are decisions which indicate that is not the low of
New York at the present time, although there has not been
a determination on that by the New York Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals has never read it

out of the statute.
MR.., fcTRUM:

In this case, they just ignored it,
The lower courts have.

They have

treated it for various reasons, constitutional rmd otherwise,
as just being an unwise legislative describemenfc.

But, other

than that, the requirement that the order be obtained during
the lifetime of the father, 1 think, is a reasonable one.
I think we are here not to consider the peculiar equities of
this particular case

and there may be equities on the

22

Appellant's side,

I don't argue that there are nofc„

What we are here to evaluate is the New York statu­
tory scheme, and whether the Legislature of the State of New
York In protecting its citizens and in passing laws with
regard to descent snd distribution, could require, as a
requirement in the case of illegitimates inheriting from
their father, that there be a court order during the lifetime
of the father in order to prevent fraud, in order to prevent
a situation where New York estates would not be closed.
Obviously, situations could arise where illegitimates are not
known of and they could make claims later on and it wouId
destroy the sanctity of decrees which determine distribution
in the <£tafce of New York.
I think for that reason the Legislature, as indi­
cated by the report of the Bennett Commission, w„as justified
in making this requirement.

1 think the requirement is a

reasonable one, and I think that is the only test,
QUi&STIoN:

Is it reasonable to assume that the two»

year limit was placed there by the Legislature, or probably
placed there by the Legislature, so that the facts could be
ascertained while there were people around who could testify?
MR, LTRUM:
behind it.

Yes, I would assume that was the purpose

I can understand the difficulty in requiring it

within two years, because .you ere dealing with a very young
child, a baby, and perhaps you don't x-jant to cut off that

23

child

righto

So l ean understand why the New York courts

have gone out of their way to excise that two-year pro- vis ion * but I also understand why it is there,,

I think it

is a functional purpose.
QUESTION:

Does the acquiescence of the Court of

Appeals or the apparent acquiescienee of the Court of
Appeals in this interpretation by its constituent courts,
mean the same thing, or should it mean the same thing to us
as a holding of the highest court of the utate construing
the statute?
MR, UTRUM:

Well, I would not classify it as a

holding, and I would not go so far, but -QUE* TI UN:
MR, STRUM:

C ou Id i fc be equa ted ?
-- I think for the purposes of this

argument and for the purposes of the constitutionality of
the New York statute, yes, I think it can be equated.
QUEUTIoN:

In any event, there was no order of

filiation?
MR, uTRUM:
QUfiSTIoN:

In this case, there was none whatsoever.
Curing the lifetime of the father*

The decedent died in '74.

The Appellant was an adult.

There was ample opportunity for him to go to court during the

QUjtLTION:

That is the

might have advised him that since the two-year period had

MR0 dTRUM:

There is no showing that he attempted

discussing a statutory scheme.

We are

I think the Legislature*in

making that determination* had every right to reasonably
require this.

I think he had* certainly* an opportunity to

go to court and make an application.

And if the court then

were to turn him down* he could have appealed on that basis.
QUESTION;

If you are talking about the statutory

scheme* I suppose* under the statute* if there was a court
order* prior to the death of his father* obtained on the
petition of either the son or the mother* it would satisfy
the statute* whether or not the father was around* could be

25
found or participated in the hearing.
MR, STRUM:
QUESTION:

I would assume so, Your Honor.
He could go to court and say the father

had disappeared and still -MR, STRUM:
QUESTION:

He could have been served by publication,
All right, but nevertheless he needn't be

available to give evidence, or anything.
MR, UTRUM:
QUESTION?

No.
Mr. Strum, what 's wrong with the day

after the father dies, what's wrong with determining -MR, UTRUM:

You are then depriving the father of

the opportunity to give evidence.

Thera is a difference

between him having a right to be there and give evidence and
participate, if he so chooses, and being precluded in the
absolute by his death.

And I think that is a distinction

which is important.
QUESTION:

How do we say that this statute is con­

stitutional and not unconstitutional because the two-year
provision will never be enforced?

Is that what you want us

to say?
MR. UTRUM:

No, Your Honor, I think we don't reach

that question because the two-year provision has nothing to
do with'*this case.
QUESTION:
statute, eventually?

Don't we have to talk about that

26

MR, STRUM: I don't believe,, Your Honor* that we
should be talking about a statute in the abstract, necessarily.
We should be talking about a statute as applied»

I think as

applied in this case the Appellant hasn’t ripened the ques­
tion because there was no attempt to obtain the order of
filiation within the two-year period»

And* furthermore*

because .New York doesn't apply the two-year requirement»
QUESTION:

Do you want us just to ignore the

statute?
MR» ilTRUM:

I would suggest that the fcwo*»y©ar

requirement is not applicable to this case»
QUESTION:

I am saying about the statute.

MR., dTRIJM: No* the statute should not be ignored*
it should be enforced»
QUESTION:

How can we mention a statute and ignore

a part of It?
MR» STRUM:

Well* the part that we are ignoring -~

or I suggest be ignored -- is not in this case»
QUESTION:

This case involves a 28 year-old man

and is not bound by the two-year old provision.
MR» STRUM:
QUESTION:

That is correct*, Your Honor.
I don't knovi what I think of somebody

who wrote that»
QUESTION:

Is it true that the courts in New York

have all agreed that the two-year provision Is invalid or

should be Ignored?
MR,, STRUM:

The courts that have heard that question

have agreed to that.
QUiiSTION:

Yes* that's what I am talking about„

QUESTION:

Will you give us the citations»

MR, STRUM:

There are citations in the brief, Your

Honor»
QUESTION:

There are citations which say, "We are

ignoring the two-year limit"?
MRo dTRUM:

Yes, there are.

They get around it

for various reasons.
QUESTION:

That's not what I said,

Ho you have one

that says, !,We ignore it"?
MR, oTRUM:
QUESTION:

Not those words, Your Honor.
That's right.

I didn’t think you did.

1 didn’t find any.
MR, STRUM:
QUESTION:
MR, STRUM:

But the courts have failed to apply it.
Are we limited to do that?
Well, I think you are limited to the

facts in this case, and the application of those facts to
the statute.
QUESTION:

Mr» Strum, if we should disagree with

you -- I don't know what the Court will do

on the issue

of whether the requirement of filiation during the lifetime
of the father is constitutional, and assume we conclude that

to be unconstitutional* then we must squarely face the two»
year problem, mustn’t we?
MR. .STRUM:

I think if you are going to say that

the requirement that it be during the lifetime of the father
is unconstitutional* then I think the whole statute will
probably fall.
QUESTION:

Then you concede that the two-year --

I don8t understand how you can consede what you in substance
do, although not quite in words, that the two-year provision
is unreasonable because it treats some illegitimates irration­
ally in a different way from other Illegitimates without a
rational justification.

How can you say that and say that

five years after birth the father dies and still the chile'
must be barred?
MR. STRUM:

I* personally, am not suggesting to

Your Honor that the two-year requirement is unreasonable.
I am saying to you that the Ne\<? York courts, when considering

QUESTION:

But you said we should assume that the

New York courts would not enforce it because it is perfectly
obvious that It is unreasonable.

That's,in substance, what

you've said, and then you cite cases.
MRbTRUM:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Why don't we just qU'Ote the Court of

Appeals, because they are passing on their own statute and

39
they didn’t say a word about the two years?
MR„ &5TRUM:

No, they didn't because they felt it

was not —
QUESTION:

Why don’t w@ just bass our opinion on

what they said?
MR„ STRUM:

That's what I am asking this Court to

do.
QUESTION:
MR* STRUM:

I see,
The only reason I raise the two-year

question is because the Appellant raised it.
QUESTION:

The cases to which you refer are those

cited on the bottom of page 4 of your brief, Matter of
Thomas and Matter of Firnm.
MR. ETRUM.:

Yes.

believe, Mat;ter of Nurse.

And there is another case, I
We will provide those citations

to the Court.
QUESTION:

You have already provided two of them.

And do you represent that there are no cases contrary to
that?
MR0 riTRUM:

I know of no cases where that question

has arisen where the New York courts have applied that twoyear statuteo
I believe that the statute in Illinois, which, of
course, was considered in TrimbIs v. Gordon, is completely
different.

That statute prohibited, in the absolute, inheritance

by an illegitimate from his father,, except under one specific,,
very limited, circumstance, that of where the natural mother
and father married and there wag an acknowledgement at that
point.
The New York statute does not attempt in any way to
discriminate»

It merely says in the case where someone is

claiming to be an illegitimate child, through a father, that
there be a court order determining that during the father's
lifetime.

And, I respectfully submit that is a substantial

difference, not only in approach but in meaning,
QUESTION:

Or that the natural mother and the

father have married,, even-after the birth of :'the Illegitimate
child? r

... .
MR, dTRUM:
QUESTION:

Yes, that would legitimatize the child,
And even though the marriage be void or

voidable,
MR» ,-JTRUM:

Right,

That would be legitimate under

another statute which is not at issue here,
QUESTION:

You don't have to have an acknowledgement,

you just have to have a marriage, right?
MR. STRUM:
QUESTION:
MR, STRUM:

That's correct.
Unlike the Illinois law.
Unlike the Illinois statute.

And I submit that had the situation arose, as applied
in Illinois, in New York, an inheritance would have been

31
permitted because there was a court order»

Thats& all the

Mew York lav? says* there has to be a court order»
QUESTION:

You mean in New York if somebody has

a 56 year-old child and if they get married that child is
legitimatized* merely by the marriage?
MR. dTRUM:

Eure,

That would legitimatize the

child»
QUESTION:
MR® bTRUM:
QUESTION:
MR. ETRUM:

3he has to marry ~-

The natural father, yes.
What if she just marries John Smith?
You wouldn't know, except there would

be a question of proof.
QUESTION:

General Strum, let me question you one©

more about the state interest that this statute vindicates.
We are talking about requirement that the order be obtained
during the lifetime of the father.

As I understand it, the

state interest is giving the father the opportunity to deny
parentage.
MR. ETRUM:
QUESTION:
MR. dTRUM:

That is one state interest.
Oh.

What else is there?

Also* the state interest is in seeing to

it that there is an orderly distribution of estates.

In othe

words* the situation is that we don't ’wish anyone* after some
body dies, to come in and make a claim, because of the dif­
ficulty of proof, and because of the question that you would

32

have to keep estates open for an inordinate period of time.
QUt^flON:

Why?

Why couldn't you have the normal

rule you have in states, that claims have to be filed within
a limited period of time?
MR. STRUM:
QUESTION:

Because you would have to publish.
You do anyway, because don't you

occasionally have estates In which people claim to be legi­
timate children and there is a contest over that?
MR* STRUM:
QUESTION:

Yes, but you would b@ opening -Therefore, you have to make that claim

within a specified period of time*
MR0 STRUM:
QUESTION:

Oh, sure*
Why couldn't the same rule taka care of

this problem?
MR» STRUM:

It could, except that you are going to

have people who are going to come in and make c la lias and say
they didn't know, or they had no opportunity to know.
QUESTION:

You have that -with legitimates, too.

You have the same thing*
Let's focus for a moment

Your primary interest,.

I gather, is that you want to give the father the opportunity
to deny parentage.
MR. STRUM:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
That's the real reason for the cutoff.

Well, supposing the papers of the father -- and thebe is

33

abundant

evidence of the fact that he is - - not just in

the somewhat ambiguous way you have here — but he has
repeatedly acknowledged it* written it out many, many times
that the person involved "is-my true and natural son,"

What

is the state interest in giving such a father an opportunity
to contradict what he has said repeatedly to the contrary?
MR, BTKUM:
QUESTION:
of proof.

How, Your Honor, do you draw the line?
You may draw it in terms of standards

You might require proof beyond all doubt, beyond

a reasonable doubts something like that.

But when you have

uncontradicted proof and thorough agreement on the facts -and I know you don’t have that here — then what is the
state interest?
MR, oTRUM:
QUESTION:

Well, again, I think —
And then do you not discriminate against

some illegitimates?
MR, BTRUM:

I don’t think you discriminate,

I think

the legislature has the right to set the standard of proof.
Now, providing that standard of proof is a reasonable one,
providing the requirements are reasonable -»
QUESTION:

This is not a standard of proof.

saying that no matter how convincing the proof.

This is

This is a

standard of eligibility.
MR. BTRUM:

It is that* but it is a standard of

eligibility by way of judicial determination.

34
I think the legislature has the right to say,

!'We

want a judicial determination when it can be had and when It
can be fairly had* not when somebody can be put upon'

am not saying it would happen in every case or in any case,
I am saying it is to preclude the possibility*
to draw a line*

You have to draw standards*

So you have
You have to

If you don't mark everything off, what

you are going to have is confusion and chaos.

I think the

I think as long as they

act fairly and reasonably* I think it is within their right*
QUjDSTION:

Sole justification* according to you* is

to protect the right of the father to testify to the contrary
when the record makes it clear he has no such desire?
MR* STRUM:

That's a determination that you are

making after the fact.

I think the legislature in the right

to protect its citizens has the right? in the first hand*
*

to set the standards,

I think people are then required to

live up to those standards* like in any other situation*-*
QUESTION:

What you are saying* perhaps* is that

New York is not obliged to have a perfect statute* so long
as they have a reasonable one.
MR* STRUM:
QUESTION:

I quite agree with the Chief Justice*- \
Does the state take any position with

respect to this claimant at all* as to v/hether he is or is
not the natural child of

MR. STRUM:

case came up on a very incomplete record.
Your Honor, there was a motion made to dismiss with
regard to the status. So the only issue before the court was
the status of the claimant.

Now* the Attorney General was
We are only a party with regard

to the constitutionality of the state statute.

don't want to comment.
QUESTION:
MR. STRUM:

You are conceding nothing factually* then
No, X am not, because ! am not in a

position to, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But it is clear that your argument would

be precisely the same if you were prepared to concede the
facts?
MR. ciTRUM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
So we should treat the legal issue as

though the facts were tantamount to being conceded, realizing
they will be challenged later ?
MR. STRUM:

Y®3.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:28 o'clock, p.m., the case was
submitted.)
