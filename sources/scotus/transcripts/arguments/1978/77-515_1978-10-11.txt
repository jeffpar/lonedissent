PROCEED I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 515, Holt Civic Club against the City
of Tuscaloosa.
Mr. Still, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD STILL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. STILL:

Mr-. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This action was heard by a three-judge district
court which was empaneled to hear a challenge to the constitu­
tionality of an Alabama statute which empowers and directs
each city and town in Alabama to exercise its police power
within a one-and-a-half or three-mile zone around the city or
the town.

The adverse decision of the district court against

the plaintiffs was appealed to this Court under 28 USC, Section
1253.

The Court reserved the question of jurisdiction, and

we have briefed that extensively; and if the Court does not
have any further questions on that point, I will move on to the
merits of the case.
Q

Mr. Still, how old a statute is this Alabama

statute?
MR. STILL:
1900s—one of them.

The statute was passed in the early
I believe it was 1907.

A second one was

passed in 1927, and I am not sure about the third one.

4
Q

So, there are three old statutes to be chal­

lenged at this late date?
MR. STILL:
Q

Yes, sir, they are old.

You say, counsel, that the statute empowers and

directs the municipal corporations or the cities to do these
particular things.

Would you make that claim that it both

empowers and directs with respect to each of the legislative
.

*

activities that we are talking about here?
MR. STILL:

Do you mean the legislative activities
*

of the city or the three statutes?
Q

Of the city.

MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, I believe that it does because

Section n-40-10, which is the primary police jurisdiction
statute, contained in Addendum B to the brief, the grey brief,,
says that ordinances of the city or town shall have force and
effect in the limits of the city or town.

And so that is a

mandatory statement there, and I believe that they would have
effect whether the city intended them to or not.
might choose not to send itn police out.

A city force

But I believe that it

is mandatory under state law.
Q

What page is Addendum B in the grey book?

MR. STILL:

It is about three pages from the back of

the brief, Your Honor.
Q

Your first brief?

MR. STILL:

Of the grey brief. Your Honor, th© brief

for the appellants.
statutas.

That contains the new language of the

There has been a recompilation of the Alabama Coda

since we originally filed the suit.

But the text of the

statutes has not changed materially.
Q

It says in the second paragraph of Section 11,

after defining the

police jurisdiction, the second paragraph

begins, "Ordinances of a city or town enforcing police or
sanitary regulations..."

Can that not just as readily be read

to read "choosing to enforce regulations" as being compelled
to enforce regulations?
MR. STILL:

Mo, sir, Your

Honor.

I believe that

that; statute has been interpreted in Alabama as defining a
class of statutes.

Police

ordinances, sanitary ordinances

are two classes of ordinances„

Other types might be financial

regulations of: the city, internal regulations of the city for
one reason or other, or zoning regulations.
zoning regulations are; not police ordinances.

Under Alabama law
And so in that

way this is a way of differentiating police and sanitary
regulations from, say, zoning ordinances or other types of
ordinances that would not have an extraterritorial effect.
Q

It is descriptive, in other words.

MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, it is descriptive of a class

of ordinances.
Q

Any ordinances falling into those categories

are effective within the extraterritorial police jurisdiction

6

of the municipality?
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, that is the way the statute

has been interpreted in Alabama.
Q

Is the case that interprets that way cited in

your brief?
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir.

I believe that we cite both

the City of Montgomery v. Roberson case and White v. City of
Decatur.

City of Montgomery v. Roberson was a case that dealt

with the power of the City of Montgomery to sons in its
extraterritorial jurisdiction.

And the Alabama Supreme Court

went into statutory construction at great lengths there to
explain that these were just, ways of describing certain
classifications of ordinances and that joning was not a police
power within the normal meaning of the term as far as cities
go because we had to pass a special law allowing cities to
zone in Alabama.

It was not considered to be in the normal

grant of powers to cities by the State of Alabama.
The case alleged both due process and equal protec­
tion grounds in the original complaint.
question of due process.

We have briefed the

And you will notice that we have cited

only two cases, and that is United States v. Texas and United
States V. Alabama, Judge Johnson's concurring opinion there.
The question of due process is so fundamental that it
generally has not had to be raised in voting rights eases.
yet, if we think about it, the process that is due to all of

And

7
these citizens is that if they are governed, they should he
allowed to have some voice in the government over them.

The

question is usually not presented to this Court in a due process
context.

But I believe that it should be in this case because

even ignoring a comparison between what the City of Tuscaloosa
doss to its citizens and what the City of Tuscaloosa does to
the people in the police jurisdiction, the fundamental question
under due process would be, What should it do to the people in
the police jurisdiction if it does not allow them to vote?
Q

What if the State of Alabama provided that the

City of Tuscaloosa shall be governed by a five-man commission,
appointed by the governor of Alabama so that the residents
within the city boundaries of Tuscaloosa would have absolutely
no say in the composition of that commission; would that be a
violation of due process?
MR. STILL:

No, Your Honor, I do not believe that it

would because in that case the state would have essentially
abolished local government except through commissioners of some
sort, agents that it appointed from the central government«

It

has done that in the past in the Port of Mobile in the late
1300s.

I think that would be a fundamentally different

situation here than one in which there is a local government
which is elected and in which these people are not allowed to
participate„
The boundary between the due process and the equal—

Q
tection claim,,

Yese that boils down to almost an equal pro­
If you say that the citizens in Tuscaloosa can

vote but citizens in the police jurisdiction cannot vote, it
seems to me that is more of an equal protection claim than a
due process claim,
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, and that is the question that

we have briefed most extensively.

But, as I said, the ques­

tion usually does not arise even, that it is a due process
claim; but we have raised that in this case, and I think it
is a sufficient ground,
0

It has arisen a good many times, I think.

Before I carre on the bench this morning, I glanced over a
comment in the Chicago Law Review of last fall in which it is
pointed out that some 35 states have this sort of system in
whole or in part, and that they date back to the late 19th
century, and that repeatedly due process attacks on extra­
territorial government; by municipalities were rejected,
MR. STILL:
0

Yes, Your Honor, they were.

So, it perhaps is not quite so obvious as you

indicate.
MR. STILL:
Q

Well, I was talking about—

The article went on to say, I should say in your

behalf, that in the light of the modern developments of equal
protection law, the result might be quite different.
MR. STILI.:

Yes, sir, I think most of those challenges

9

were raised. , as you point out., in the late 1800s at a time
when—Q

The early years of this century anyway»

MR„ STILL:

Yes, sir, or the early part of this

century.
The equal protection question is, 1 think, a funda-,,
xnnfcai one that we are dealing with here»

As the Chicago Law

Review comment pointed out, there are 35 states that have some
sort of extraterritorial power for their cities.

Only four

states—Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota—-have
full police power extraterritorial jurisdictions.

The rest of

them allow some sort of zoning or some sort of business regula­
tion or nuisance regulation in an extraterritorial sone.

But

the full-fledged police jurisdiction that we are talking about
in this case is only in four states.
The equal protection "-“the first matter that we get
to in that regard i.s, What is the proper standard of review?
The City of Tuscaloosa has raised the point that only a
rational relationship must be shown between the means and the
end that the state has chosen.

And they cite for authority on

that point Salyer Land Company v, Tulare Water Storage District.
That case utilised such a test—the rational relationship
test—rather than a strict scrutiny test because this Court
first determined that the Tulare District was not a general
purpose governmenti and, therefore, the strict scrutiny rule

10
did not apply because it was not really the right to vote in
the fundamental sense, as we know it, that was involved in the
case.

The City of Tuscaloosa is not. such a limited purpose

government in the police jurisdiction.

The only things the

city cannot do in the police jurisdiction that it can do in
the city limits of Tuscaloosa is collect ad valorem property
taxes and to zone, as I pointed out a moment ago.

It may also

collect only one-half of the usual license fee that it charges
inside the city.
Q

If the City of Tuscaloosa were to attempt to

annex the police jurisdiction, would some sort of consent on
the part of the residents in the police jurisdiction be
required, seme sort of referendum?
MR. STILL?

Some sort of consent is rewuired under

Alabama law, Your Honor.

The statutes provide for three or
Each one of them either requires a

referendum among the effected voters, residents of the par­
ticular area, or their consent on a petition.
different statutes for different cities.

There are

But every one of them

requires both the consent of the city and the consent of the
affected voters in a particular area.

In some cases there are

additional requirements.
Q

What if in this situation the city had sought to

annex the police jurisdiction that you are complaining about
and the citizens in the affected area had refused to foe annexed?

11
would your case be any different?
MR. STILL:
constantly growing,

No, sir, I do not believe so.

The city is

As the city has pointed out in their brief,

it has grown about-quintupled in size over the last 25 years
or so.

I do not think that the case is any different if these

people had been given a choice about whether they wanted to be
in the city of Tuscaloosa and choose not to be because they are
still treated differently than the people-Q

Does net the State of Alabama have some concern

with the added law enforcement problems fight around the ring
of an urban area that enable it to do some things that it might
not be able to do way out in the country?
MR. STILL;

Yes, sir, I believe that the state may

have a legitimate concern.

But either under the rational,

relationship test or the compelling state interest test, we
have got to look at the end they are seeking, which is protec­
tion of these people from marauders of various sorts by the
police and the means that they choose to do so.

The means

that they have chosen to use in this particular case are to
allow a different government, that these people do not have a
vote in, to govern them.

And that is the equal protection

question and the due process question.

We are not attacking

the end of the regulation, state saying that these people need
some sort of protection.

We are simply attacking the means by

which they have done it because, as the Chicago Law Review

12
article or comment pointed out, there are many different ways
in which these people, who live in areas right outside cities,
could be governed.
As I pointed out, 46 states do not have the type of
jurisdiction that we are talking about in /Alabama.

So, they

have figured out some way to protect these people without
depriving them of the right to vote by the government that is
supposedly protecting them.

There are 15 states that have no

sort of extraterritorial jurisdiction at all.

They utilize

such things as township governments or direct police protection
by the county government.

And 1 think those could be used in

Alabama under the Alabama constitution, perhaps not townships
per se but direct government by the county government could
be used.
Q

You rely primarily on the .reapporfcionment cases

in this Court, do you not?
MR. STILL;

Not so much the reapportionment cases,

Your Honor, but that line of cases beginning with Kramer v. Union
Free School District, which are not so much reapportionment
cases as they are voting rights cases.
Q

Yes.

Ind in Kramer the complaint was that,

unmarried man, if that is what he was, was not allowed to vote
in a school board election—
MR. STILL:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

—in that school board election in the State of

13

New York, as I remember it.
MR. STILL:
Q

Yes.

And what he asked for in his complain was that

he be allowed to vote, was it not?
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir.

He was seeking the right to

vote in that particular case because that was the only prac­
tical remedy.

No matter what he did, there was no way he could

isolate himself from the pervasive effects of a. school in our
society today.

That was the whole basis of the Court’s

decision.
Q

He was going to ba taxed if the tax levy or

bond issue were passed by the voters.
MR. STILLs

He was going to be taxed directly.

He

did net own any property.
Q

He was a tenant, as I remember.

MR. STILL:

That is right.

He lived with his parents,

and he was a non-property owner.
Q

You may remember that I dissented in that case.

MR. STILL:
Q

Yes, sir, I do.

So, I do not defend it.

But, in any event, the

relief he was asking was that he be allowed to vote.

The

relief you are asking is that this whole extraterritorial
jurisdiction be held to be invalid, is it not?
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, that is correct, and that is

because we have a choice in this case which no one else has had

14
as a practical matter.

Mr. Kramer, as I said, did not have any

practical way to pull himself out of society and say, ,!The
schools are; not going to affect me.
Cipriano, in the City of Phoenix case, was going to
be affected by the utility rates no matter what he did.

?s

long as he was hooked up directly or indirectly to the city's
utilities, he was going to be paying for the bond issue that
the property owners were passing.
In Evans v. Cornman the only practical thing to do
was to extend the right to vote to those people who lived out
at the NIH enclave in Montgomery County, Maryland because if
you had said chat Maryland must withdraw their authority over
them, you would have had to declare unconstitutional the
Federal Assimilative Crimes Act and several other federal acts,
an entire federal scheme of regulation.
Q

But, in any event, those cases would seem to

indicate that the constitutional injury perceived by the Court
was in prohibiting those plaintiffs from voting.
MR. STILLs
Q

Yes, sir.

And that v;as the constitutional injury.

You do

not allege einv such constitutional injury.
MR. STILL:
that because

Yes, sir, we allege the flip side of

chase residents of the Holt area are not allowed

to vote and they are governed , then they are deprived of their
constitutional right.

Now, we have a choice-—

MR. STILL:
complaint.

No, sir, we did not ask for that in the

But I think that the district court could have

granted that particular relief if it had found that we stated
a cause of action.

I think that it also, as a practical

matter, could have granted the relief that we sought because
that relief would actually be less disruptive of the state's
regulatory system than would eKtending the right to vote.
Q

In Reynolds against Bins could the Court have

granted the relief of relieving the City and County of Denver
of any jurisdiction in the State of Colorado?
MR. STILL:
Q

That was Lucas.

MR. STILL:
Q

No, sir, I do not believe that they could.

Yes.

Luccis, yes.

MR. STILI,:

Why is that different from this?

And yet they will not be governed by the

that could be made in this case between the remedies.

But, as

I say, if the District Court had found that we had stated a
cause of action, had allowed us to go to trial and it found

16

that we prevailed, it could have ordered a remedy of saying,
"We declare this statute to be unconstitutional, and we give
the state legislature one year to come up with a new statute;
and, if it does not, then we will undertake to do something
ourselves,” in much the same way that many times reapportioning
courts have done so»

They have declared the present schema

unconstitutional and then deferred to the state legislature to
do so.

And, in fact, this Court requires it to do so if at

all practical.
0

But your lawsuit is analogous to what those

voting cases and reapportionment cases would have been had the
plaintiff in the reapportionment cases said this state legisla­
ture is malapportioned; therefore, anything it does is
and void.

It is an invalid legislature.

null

And the Court, at.

least by some reaction, has declined to accept the proposition
that a rnalapportioned legislature cannot legislate.
MR. STILL;

Yes, Your Honor, and in those cases in

which people actually did claim that a rnalapportioned legisla­
ture did not have the power to legislate—
Q

We have had cases, for example, where a mal-

apportioned legislature has enacted laws, and those laws are
attacked as invalid because they were enacted by an unconstitu­
tional legislature.

And the Court—I do not remember any

opinions dealing with it in a plenary way, but the Court at
least by summary action has rejected those claims.

17
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, but in many of those reappor-

tionment cases I believe that the plaintiffs in addition
sought to have the present legislature just removed from
office immediately and that-Q

No, the;y sought to ask this Court to hold

constitutionally invalid state laws enacted by concededly
malapporticned legislatures.
MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, and the point that I am trying

to make is that just because you ask for the wrong remedy in
your initial complaint does not mean that the complaint is
invalid if you state
Q

t.

cause of action.

But often the remedy identifies the constitu­

tional injury about which you are complaining.
MR. STILL:

Yes.

And we have identified the

constitutional injury as these people being governed and not
being allowed to vote,
0

So, if the constitutional injury is that you are

not being allowed to vote, then the redress for that injury is
that you be allowed to vote.
MR. STILL:
hold that.

It may be that the district court will

It may be that this Court will hold that.

We will

accept that kind of remedy because I think if it happened, that
the State of Alabama would remedy that situation very quickly
by passing a new statute probably abolishing the police
jurisdiction.

But there are approximately 16,000 people who

18

live in the police jurisdiction of Tuscaloosa.

There are

70,000 people who live in the City of Tuscaloosa.

We are

talking about expanding the City of Tuscaloosa by one-fourth
approximately, by judicial fiat, if you hold that these people
have a right to vote.
Q

We say it would be much less disruptive-

How do you get the judicial fiat when you have

got a state statute involved?
MR. STILL;
Q

Excuse me, Your Honor?

It is not the decision of this Court that would

MR. STILL;

Yes, sir, but I am saying that the Court-

And what you want us to do is to find that this

state statute is unconstitutional and then dream up a remedy
for you.

And I mean dream because you have not tolcl us

yet what you want, have you?
MR. STILL;
Q

Yes, sir, I have.

We have asked—-

Try it again.

MR. STILL;

I have asked that the city's jurisdic­

tion over these people who do not live inside the City of
Tuscaloosa be removed from them, that the City of Tuscaloosa
not be allowed to govern them.

And how do you do that?

MR. STILL;

You simply tall the City of Tuscaloosa

Yes, sir, I believe that you could.

MR. STILL:
Q

Yes, sir.

The original-—

Did you ask it before right now?

MR. STILL;

Yes, sir.

The original complaint, if

you will look in the complaint, it asks that an injunction be
issued enjoining the enforcement of the police jurisdiction
statute, the main police jurisdiction statute, and declaring
two additional police jurisdiction statutes to be unconstitu­
tional.

It does not ask that they be enjoined because I believe

that they are dependent upon the main police jurisdiction
statute„

What evidence did you put on?

evidence on in this case.

It was dismissed by a single-judge

The Fifth Circuit reversed the case, sent it

back to bs heard by a three-judge district court.

The

three-judge district court then dismissed on another motion to
dismiss.

There is some evidence in the file in this case, in

the record in this case, because we did take discovery.

20
presumably the district court did take a look at that, but it
never mentioned it in its particular opinion.
Q

But you did have discovery.

MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, we did take discovery.

The

case was pending for three years in the district court at two
different times.

I notice you put great weight on the fact that

you said, in filing a complaint, "and for other relief."

You

are not relying on that, are you?
MR. STILL:

That, Your Honor, is the standard way of

doing things in Alabama.

But, as I pointed out, the Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure allow the Court to grant such other
relief as it may find proper.

If we have stated a cause of

action before we get to the wherefores—
Q
"dream up."

That is just why a minute ago I used the word
That is what you want the Court to do.

MR. STILL:
dream up.

No, sir, I am not asking the Court to

I ask for a. specific remedy, and I think—
Q

Are you limited to that now in your argument?

MR. STILL:

No, sii*, I

do not believe that we are

limited to that because I think under the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure the Court is allowed, whether I ask for such other
further equitable relief as may be granted, I think the Court is
allowed to fashion such a remedy as would be equitable in the
situation.

But if the Court finds that I am only entitled to

A and X ask for B--but A is encompassed within the cause of
action that I ask for—that they will grant that sort of thing.
There are many cases in which people will ask for injunctions
which, for one reason or another, might be barred by equitable
principles or by the Constitution of the United States, the
Eleventh Amendment or something like that.

So, instead of

issuing a mandatory injunction that says to the state, "Spend
money" the Court comes back and says, "Do not do this unless
you do something constitutional, they issue a prohibitive—
0

What do you want us to do other than to issue

these injunctions?
MR. STILL?

I want this Court specifically to reverse

the case and send it back to the district court, which would
then issue the injunctions and declare two statutes unconsti­
tutional and enjoin a third statute from being enforced.
Q

And what else?

MR. STILL:

That will satisfy you?

That would be sufficient, Your Honor.

That would be sufficient.
Q

Mr. Still, when the Court noted probable

jurisdiction in this case, as you have already observed, it
indicated that four justices had enough doubt about jurisdiction
so as to postpone the resolution, and you have elected to submit

I just want to be sure that you are content

to do that.
MR, STILL:

Yes* sir* I am* but I am certainly

ready* willing* and able to answer questions if anyone has any
on the jurisdictional question,
Q

Before you go on* may I ask your reaction to

Q

Are these different from state criminal provisions?

MR. STILL:

Yes, sir, some of them are.

For instance,

in Alabama, just to take an offhand example, prostitution is not
illegal under Alabama law, but prostitution is illegal under
Tuscaloosa city ordinances.

It is illegal to solicit for

prostitution under Alabama law.

It is illegal to keep a bawdy

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you.

Mr. Finnell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. WAGNER FINNELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FINNELL:
I

Mr. Chief, and if the Court please;

first would like to more fully answer some of the

questions that have been posed by this Court.

For instance,

Mr. Justice Powell asked the question, Suppose this were
confined to police powers in the extraterritorial aspect.

I

say that it is so confined because ordinances of a police and
sanitary nature may be effective both within the city and
within the police jurisdiction.

I know really, other then the

fact that the court, the municipal court—which is the same as
the district court in all respects—has jurisdiction out in
this area.

That may be an aspect of police power.

But,

other than that, I know of no other powers that are granted in
police jurisdiction.
As the Court or some of the members have pointed out,
there is no authority to tax, there is no authority to charge
a business outside or a privilege license, for the purpose of
general revenue.
Supreme Court.

That has been clearly held fay the Alabama
Of course, within the city you can license

for general revenue purposes.

And the business,., the esfcab™

lishment, cannot contest on the ground that it is more than the

25

cost of services might be»

But outside the corporate limits,

the Alabama Supreme Court has very carefully limited that to
a charge commensurate with the cost of the services rendered.
That has been going on since .1881 in the City of Van Hook y.
Selma.

They were then making charges outside of the corporate

limits, and there the Court struck down an ordinance that made
a charge more than the reasonable cost of promoting the health
and welfare and well-being of those persons in the police
jurisdiction,

later, when the so-called authorisation to tax

that has been cited here many times, was adopted by the state
legislature in 1927—that is when It was

adopted, and then

there is a case which I do not have before me, it is in my
brief--squarely ruled on it, and the Court held that this
added nothing to the ciuthority of a municipality to license
within the police jurisdiction—

Q

If. T. understood it, Mr. Pinnell—

MR. PINNELLt
Q

Yes, sir.

—police power has at least two meanings.

There

is the constitutional meaning of meaning the states reserve
power to enact legislation within the appropriate reserve
powers of the states, and that is often compendiously known as
the police power of a state.

I had understood my Brother

Powell's question to be more limited.

That is, suppose it had

been confined only to sending the city policemen out there—and
that is a much more limited concept.

It was pointed out by

26

your brother on the other side that this would involve also
the extension of the city’s legislative power out into the
police jurisdiction.
MR. FINNELL:
Q

It does»"

When you say this is confined to the police

power, you are perfectly accurate, if that tern?, is understood
as being the appropriate power of the municipality to govern
itself.

It is only part of the police power that is extended.

But it is certainly much more than simply sending the city
policemen out there to enforce the law, the: state law.
MR. FINNELLs
Q

Yes, sir.

Certainly it involves—

It is an extension of the legislative power

of the municipality beyond its territorial limits.
MR. FINNELLs

Absolutely, Your Honor.

It allows the

ordinances that are effective within the corporate limits to
be effective also outside within a limited area.
Q

Mr. Fir nail, suppose in the area outside of

Tuscaloosa, which we are talking about, the people in a 14square-block area say, "Look, we have not seen a policeman in
the last 14 years, and we need soma policemen hare,'5 how would
they go about getting one?
MR. FINNELL:
Q

We have that complaint quite often.

How would they go about getting them?

MR. FINNELL:

They would call the police department

or the police commissioner or simply come before the commission

27

board, as they oftan do, and ask that the patrols be extended
on a more regular basis*
Q

And if they refuse, what could they do?

MR. FINN2LL:

1 do not think the city could be

required to do that, Your Honor.
Q

The people inside Tuscaloosa, could they not go

one step further and say, "Dear Mr. Commissioner of Police,
if you do not put them in there, we will vote you out of
office"?
MR. FINNELL;
Q

They could do that, Your Honor.

Could they not?

And the people outside could

not do that.
MR. FINNELL:
Q

No, sir.

But that is a difference, is it not?

MR. FINNELL:

In the sense that if you are not

talking about a person engaged
Q

in business—

I am talking about a voter, a qualified,

registered voter,
MR. FINNELL:

That is quite true.

in the corporate limits, Your Honor.
Q

Thsy do not vote

They do not have that—

They have no authority at all as to whether they

shall have good or bad police.
MR. FINNELL:
Q

No, sir,

Is there a county police force?

I suppose there

is a county sheriff.

/

28

MR. FINNELL2

Thera is a county sheriff, and there

is a county police force, and it is of course the duty of the
sheriff to police in this area.

Unfortunately in Alabama maybe

our laws are not as good as they should be? but the county has
been more or less a caretaking institution.

The deputy

sheriffs do answer calls outside, but they spend much of their
time supporting the courts, issuing subpoenas, that sort of
thing.
For instance, our laws for the sale of alcoholic
beverages limit the right to have on premises sales to the
police jurisdiction for the simple reason that the city police
are equipped and able to enforce that area.
Q

Does the county police have jurisdiction

within the city?
MR. FINNELL:

Q

Yes, sir, they do.

It is countywide.

Countywide, including within the city.

MR. FINNELL:

Countywide.

As a matter of course,

they take the position "It is none of our business in the city,
You take care of it" because it is expensive.
Q

It is s matter of

Q

Yes.

But they do have jurisdiction in the city.

Q

Yes, sir, they certainly do.

Is there a state police force?

MR. FINNELL:

Yes, we have a state highway patrol

29

that also has jurisdiction.
Q

Only a highway patrol?

MR. FINNELL:
Q

That is all.

Its name seems to imply it has jurisdiction

only of traffic offenses; is that correct?
MR. FINNELL:

They have other jurisdiction; they

primarily concern themselves with traffic, yes, sir.
Q
very careful

I am familiar with the State of Ohio, which is
that it does not have a state police force.

It

has a state highway patrol with very limited jurisdiction.
MR. FINNELLs

Mo, we have other police too.

We

have a criminal investigation division of the State of Alabama
and some of the enforcement people for the ABC Board.

There ■>

are other police-type officers of the state.
Q

Specialized.

MR.. FINNELL:
Q

But there is no general state police forces.

MR. FINNELL:
Q

Yes, sir.

Other than the highway patrol.

Its name certainly does not indicate it is a

general police force.
MR. FINNELL:

In practice it is not either, Your

Honor»
Q

Mr. Finnell, you mentioned liquor licenses.

I

of selling alcoholic beverages outside the city itself but

ment of the city?

Q

Can the city prohibit a tavern from opening in

a particular part of that whole area?
MR. FINNELLt

The city could prohibit the sale of

liquor, a liquor license.

Under our peculiar law, the ABC

Board, a state agency, is vested primarily with the control of
all the alcoholic beverages»

But the law does grant to the

municipality the right to approve or disprove the granting
of an on-premises liquor license as such.

A bill like—no, we

could not prohibit it anywhere except to plead with the ABC
Board.

But the liquor license, yes, it could be prohibited by

the municipal corporation in that area.

Or it could be

prohibited by the ABC Board, and people often go to the ABC
Board with—
Q

And, conversely, if both the city and the county

grant a license for a particular location, the residents in the
neighborhood have no place to complain.

1 guess they could

complain to the county.
MR. F1NNELL:

They could complain to the county or

they could complain tc the ABC Board, which is often done, yes.
Q

The state.

MR. FINNELL:

What about the decision of whether, in a par­

ticular part of the three-mile area., there should be one-way
streets or what the specific speed limit shall be and stop
signs and that kind of thing?
MR. FINNELL:

That is all done by the city?

The city can do that and does do it. in

certain cases, and in connection with that, Your Honor, I would
like to answer a question too about the annexation procedures
in Alabama because I think they are tied together.
For instance, we have no right to annex property to
the city unless, in all cases, the majority of the property
owners themselves agree.

We have many—let us say more than

one—several areas where there is a highly developed industrial
or business area community.

They are

And even where it is not adjacent

to they do that where it is necessary to do so to soma extent.
For instance, the industries—look at the interroga­
tories here.

That looks like a whole lot of money.

It looks

like a mass of control when you just read what is in the code,
what might be policed out there.

But when you consider the

fact that all of the industries which gather around the city
have traditionally elected not to come within a city—for
instance, the B. F. Goodrich Company recently magnanimously
gave the city a half acre to build a fire station on, which

32
they did, not to serve B. F„ Goodrich but to serve all the
corporate limits that had grown up to and around the plant.
Incidentally, that allowed the company to do away
with their own individual fire-fighting proceedings.

But the

purpose is to serve those residents of the city around there.
So, these people get a great deal of benefit out of
this police jurisdiction.

It is not a help to the city,

financial help,
Q

This has puzzled me a little bit, Mr, Finnell.

Ordinarily these days people are complaining too much cost for
too little service in terms of taxes.

Here these people are

getting a reither expensive amount of governmental service
without paying for it; is that correct?
MR. FINNELL:

I agree, Your Honor, and I think that

explains the—
Q

That dees not decide the constitutional question

but—
MR. FINNELL:

No, sir.

It certainly explains, I think

though, why there is no person that pays a tax or license for

Not one of them has chosen

to sue or complain about it.

Alabama cases require that you not only must limit it to the
reasonable cost but you must show-—affirmatively show--that in

Q

Could the city—the converse of what you are

saying—could the city decide that we want to enforce a par­
ticular type of ordinance just in the police jurisdiction but
not in the city?
MR. FINNELL:

Your Honor, 1 would say no.

The wording

of this statute itself says they shall have effect in the city
and in the police district.

I have never heard of that being

34
done.

Q

If a liquor license or any other license is

granted where the location becomes a factor, you say that the
City of Tuscaloosa reserves the right to issue that license,
does the county licensing process get into the fixing of the
location too or just the city?
MR. FINNELL;

Primarily I think it is the city.

Whether that is an abrogation on the part of the county of the
responsibility, I am not sure,

I think though it is.

Does the City of Tuscaloosa segregate and

identify the cost to the taxpayers of Tuscaloosa to provide
these services for the appellants in this case?
MP.. FINNELL;

That was the first

time that had been an actual requirement, although Mr, Justice
Livingston had indicated that some years ago in a case,
Q

There being no record on that in this case, is

that a matter the Court could or did take notice of judicially
as to how much services these people were getting for nothing?

I think it is probably

it of the unnecessary allegations, first there is an allega­

jurisdiction who are rot in any other city.

That apparently is

So, disregard

Q

Are we entitled to disregard it on a motion to

MR. FINNELL;
would think so.

Yes, sir, I would think so.

Arid as far as the allegation of the right to

vote, when these people live outside of the political sub­
division, when they have never been a part of the political
subdivision, when we are talking about a general municipal
election, how could it be said that they have the right to vote?
This is not a special type election like Tulare or the other
cases this Court went into.

This is a aeneral municipal

election.
Could it be said that because a person lives outside
of the State of Virginia, for instance, but ha3 an abiding
interest in that election could vote there?

Or could it be

said that a person living within the corporate limits of the
City of Tuscaloosa, who otherwise is qualified to vote, could
be disqualified because he has simply no interest in the
election?

The interest doctrine is not applicable.

I think that, on the face of the

If you lay that aside, lay aside the

allegations that these people have a right to vote—which, it
seems to me of course, is not so.

It is alleged simply because

if you are denied the right to vote, if you allege that you are

37

denied the right to vote, you allege

a substantial in juicy»

But

when you allege it only to grant jurisdiction and credibility
on another matter, I would say lay that aside, the vote.
Then in the complaint there is no attempt to challenge
any particular ordinance.

And the brief of the appellants

states that "we do not find it necessary to attack any par­
ticular ordinance or the effect of it, nor do we find it
necessary to show that we are threatened by any such particular
ordinance,"
Q

Now, that puts in issue—
Mr. Finnell--

MR. FINNELL:

—just one question, as I understand it,

and that would be this, whether or not a state statute
granting

any vestige of extraterritorial jurisdiction to its

municipality is unconstitutional per se.

That pure legal

question, I think, was presented to the Court.

And although

they documented their various findings beautifully--the district
judge did--I think that does present a pure legal question
that could be handled on a motion to dismiss.
Q

Mr. Finnell, again considering the fact we have

a motion to dismiss, have the plaintiffs alleged that they
were denied a right tc vote?
MR. FINNELL:

Yes, sir, they did.

They said they

MR. FINNELL:

It is graduated on volume, but the

maximum is five -thousand,,
Q

By volume you mean gross sales?

Gross sales, yes, sir.

And the same tax is applied to the city except

it is twice as large?
MR. FINNELL:
Q

City businesses?

MR. FINNELL:
Q

That is right, sir.

Yes.

enterprises and service enterprises and the like?

category for many of the businesses.

MR. FINNELL:

Yes, they have to be there.

they pay that half license, then they are absolutely entitled
to police and fire protection; and of course the reduction in
the fire rates probably absorbs that tax.

how many residents of the police jurisdiction might have a

maybe they should not all be in the same class.

But I understood the question to be directed at

the possibility, if not the probability, that many of the
people in this area would not want the results sought by the

jurisdiction even knew that this case was going on, some of
them would bs horrified.

Are you, like your friend on the other side,

going to rely on ycur brief for your argument on the question
of whether or not this Court has jurisdiction?

that this was not a case for a three-judge court.

There

are two propositions that I do want to state that I believe
ought to be

centralto the disposition of this case? certainly

they are central to my argument.
not at stake here.

One, that the right to vote is

What is at stake is the right of a state,

under its police powers, by statute, to extend any vestige of
extraterritorial jurisdiction.

And, secondly, that when

relief is sought under the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly
in the interpretation of a state statute, it is only when an
established or fundamental constitutional right is impinged
upon by the state that strict judicial scrutiny, the compelling
state interest, test, or the choice of the least restrictive
alternative is required

47
Q

Mr. Finnell, may I ask, do you regard any of thes

defendants as state officers?
MR. FINNELL:

I do not, Your Honor.

In fact, they

may have been performing state policy, but they are not per­
forming a state function as required—
Q

If they are not state officers, that, would be

another reason why a three-judge court was not required, would
it not?
MR. FINNELL:

It certainly would, sir.

I was really

prepared to argue all of that, but I had not gotten to it.
Q

Then in any event there was no service made on

the governor or the attorney-general.
MR. FINNELL:
G

No, sir, none was made.

Did you raise any objection along that line?

MR. FINNELL:

I did not, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Finnell,,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD STILL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. STILL:
Q

May it please the Court—

Even though you have waived it, I would like to

have your comment on the lack of pervasive statewide impact
)

her©.
MR. STILL:

The law, as I pointed out at the beginning

of my argument, rewuires that each city ehforce its police
ordinances and sanitary ordinances in the police jurisdiction.

48
It is not simply an enabling statute.

It is a statute which

requires that this be done statewide.

Every city in the State

of Alabama, every town in the State of Alabama must enforce
its police powers in that police jurisdiction zone.
Q

Mr0 Still, one of the cases you cited in

response to a question from me earlier was Roberson against
the City of Montgomery, and I have gotten that case; and there
the Supreme Court of Alabama describes the city’s contention
under Section 9, which is the state’s section there.

The

city contends that it has authority to enforce its zoningordinances under Section 9.
MR. STILL;

That sounds like an enabling act.

As I point out, Your Honor, that may be

a poor choice of words on the part of the Alabama Supreme
Court.

I think the question—
Q

We are bound, by it.

MR. STILL:
0

Yes, sir.

But I think the question---

We are bound by it.

MR. STILL;

Yes, sir, but I think the question

presented in the Roberson case was whether or not zoning is
included within the term "police power."
Q

Do you agree that if this is nothing more than an

enabling act, that it is improper for a three-judge court to
decide the case?
MR. STILL;

No, sir, I do not because I believe even

an enabling act-—I believe that the complaint, fairly read on

49

its face, shows that the statute is being enforced or is being
utilized by numerous jurisdictions around the State of Alabama,
and I do not think that we have the factual controversy; this
has never been put into contention by the City of Tuscaloosa,
either through a motion to dismiss or through an answer, which
has never been filed in this case, that this does not have a
statewide impact.

This is not like the case of Board of

Regents v. Mew Left Project in which the regulation on its
very face only applied to the Texas regent system and not to
the other colleges and universities around the state.
I appreciate; the Court’s attention.

Thank you very

much.
Q

I have just a question for you, which I suggest

you need not answer if you do not want to, and you will not
be prejudiced for not answering.

As I suggested to your friend,

most of the complaints; these day3 about government are paying
too much and getting too little.

Here the people that you

purport to represent here, that you do represent, and the
others in that area are getting a lot of free services, are
they not?
MR. STILLs
}

They are getting some services, Your

Honor, which perhaps might be costing them less than if they
were in the City of Tuscaloosa.
Q

They might have to pay twice as much for the

licenses, for example.

50

MR. STILL?

That it would be.

But they axe not

allowed to vote, and they consider that deprivation of the
right to vote and, at the same time, the imposition of the
government over them to be a commodity that does not have a
particular price.
Q

This is a little bit like George III running

the area from a distance?
MR. STILL?

Something like that, Your Honor.

I have

tried to stay away from Revolutionary War rhetoric in this
case, but it is something like that.
Q

[Laughter]

If that is what goes under Revolutionary War

rhetoric, it is strange that in drafting your prayer for relief
you did not even ask for the right to vote.
MR. STILL:

No, sir, as I say, Your Honor, my clients

made a choice about; which they wanted—
Q

You do not seem to be outraged about the

inability to vote.

That is the impression that comes across.

MR. STILL:

No, sir, we pointed that out.

If you

will read paragraph 10 of the complaint, we specifically say,
"We are denied the right to vote.”

And then we say in para­

graph 11—
Q

You do not say, "We are denied the right."

do not even say that.
MR. STILL?
Q

You

You say the denial does such and such.
No, in paragraph 11 it says—

Paragraph 10 says just what he says.

51
MR. ETILLs
Q

Yes.

Does it?

MR. STILL:

I am sorry.

Paragraph 10 says, “People who live in

the police jurisdiction are denied the right to vote, denied
the right to participate in referenda, initiatives and recalls,'5
that sort of thing, that are allowed to other citizens in the
City of Tuscaloosa,,
Paragraph 11 goes on to say, "As a consequence of
that denial of a right to vote"—
Q

Paragraph 10 points out as a factual matter that

these people are not allowed to vote.

But you never say that

there is anything wrong with being not allowed to vote.
MR. STILL:

I believe that we do, Your Honor, because

we say that not being allowed to vote and being governed is
the conflict that ere cites the constitutional problem in this
case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemeni the

case is submitted.
