ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. POORE, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. POORE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is an appeal by the State of Montana from the
majority judgment of a three-judge Federal District Court de­
claring that the Montana contractors gross receipts tax is un­
constitutional as to the government and those with whom it
deals on the grounds that it violates the Supremacy Clause In
that the proceeds of the Act which is a state act, of course,
flow to the State of Montana and not to the Federal Government
and therefore that is discrimination against the Federal
Government,
Of course, for an understanding of the lower court’s
holding, It is necessary to also understand the Act in question,
which imposes a 1 percent gross receipts tax on any public
contractor who has a job above $1,000 in the State of Montana.
Thus, a contractor who would be building a road for the State
of Montana or a contractor building a road for a dam for the
Federal Government — and this is important to us — a
contractor who would be building a school for a school district

4
In Butte or building a dam for private landowners who had
organised a public irrigation district as authorised by the
Montana statute, or building a sewage lagoon for the benefit of
private citizens who had orvanized a sewage disposal district
and on and on as to the various sub-boards and commissions that
are authorized under our Montana Act and generally throughout
all of the states to the best of my knowledge, any such contract
for construction, whether it was state, whether it was federal
or whether it was board or commission oriented would pay the
tax.
The tax, however sdoes not fall upon a private con­
tractor, that is a contractor doing business for a strictly
private individual.
It is important also that the Court understand the
purpose of the Act.

The need for the Act became apparent in

Montana tin the mid-sixties when, by virtue of the amount of
public construction, both stats and federal, and the natural
mobility of the equipment used in such construction, tbs
various assessing counties in the state found that they are
unable to keep track of the heavy equipment used by contractors
and that, to quote the testimony you might say of the witnesses
at the trial court level, some contractors would claim that
their equipment on tax day was in Gallatin County, another
would claim that it was — he would then claim to another county,
that it was in Cascade County, and to a third that didn’t even

5
exist o
QUESTION:

I can confirm that to a certain extent.

One of my experience of work in construction in the middle part
of Colorado during summers was loading contractors'* equipment
onto flatcars and shipping it from one county to another»
MR. POORE:

That is the very problem, Your Honor»

a while they used to even drive cattle across state lines.

For
Of

course, that isn't applicable here, but the chasing down of
equipment and getting it assessed to the proper county and
properly assessed was a real problem*

Consequently, the incen-

tive for these contractors to properly declare their equipment
and the problem wasn’t as pertinent to ordinary private in­
dividuals building a home or a garage or building a barn because
he was traditionally dealing in his own county with contractors
known to the assessors.
QUESTION:

But instead under the Act ~

Mr* Poore, would there not be large private

contractors who would have the same kind of problem to building
a big office building or a hotel or something?
MR. POORE:

Yes, the large private contractor ~

again, there aren’t that many in Montana, but if the Montana
Power Company was going to build a large office building, they
probably would, if he was going to build it, if it was going
to be built in Butte, there probably would be some contractors
come from the far ends of the state and therefore get out of
their1 own particular counties and it would create a similar

6
problem, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

How many large buildings does the Montana

Power Company have throughout the state?
MR. POORE:
QUESTION:
large?

It has one in Butte ~
When you say large, what do you mean by

How many stories?
MR. POORE:

Butte*s building is four stories high and

about 100 feet fronting on Broadway Street, and I am guessing
that they have maybe two or three other somewhat comparable
buildings throughout the entire state„
The incentives, of course, for the declaration in the
— the purpose behind the Act was not to get at the Federal
Government in any way, shape or forra0
QUESTION:

Mr. Poore, is it the state’s submission

that substantially all of the large construction projects are
public projects?

For example, schools and all the rest are ~

MR. POORE:

I think that would definitely be true.

The larger construction is state construction like a new lav?
building at the university or building roads and that type of
thing.

Of course, the federal construction in Montana has been

substantial.

And the private construction, like the Montana

Power, and another name just doesn’t jump to me, would be
relatively small.
Of course, the incentive was the dollar-for-dollar
credit so that the —» I think the government uses a happy phrase

7
that this tax was hostage to the payment of personal property
taxes and income taxes.

By virtue of these credits;, the

effective rate of the 1 percent tax becomes one-half of one
percent»

and Kiewit #2» the State of Montana held that this

was a valid revenue producing measure*
Now» this Act was enacted in 19&7®

Thereafter» the

Federal Government» which had a contract to build Libby Dam with
Kiewit & Sons» directed Kiewit to file one action in the state
courts which became Kiewit #1»

The Federal Government itself

filed this action in the federal court» as X say» this particu­
lar action®
Now9 it is important that the Court understand that
these two actions were substantially identical» that the govern­
ment had directed the filing of the state court action» but
stipulated and it is stipulated to be the real party in inter­
est» controlled all the strategy of the state court action and
paid all of the costs.
As soon as the -« these two actions were filed in
April of 197I*

The state court action was first0

court action was shortly thereafter*

The federal

The three-court judge

then ordered a hearing on the question of abstention of the
tax and an injunction against the State of Montana, and the
State of Montana filed a motion that an abstention of the
action in the federal court pending a resolution in the state
court» and cited the Meridian ease of this Supreme Court.

8
The day that the matter was set for hearings the
governments referring to the Federal Government, stipuled with
the State of Montana for continuance of the lawsuit in the
federal court pending a final resolution in the state courts.
Thereafter, the matter did proceed, and I emphasise that the
same identical questions of constitutionality of the Act under
the Supremacy Clause and under the Equal Protection Clause were
presented in the state court and proceeded up through the state
court first in the trial court, tried before a county judge,
then affirmed in the state supreme court, where the court held
that the government was — that the Act more accurately did not
violate the Equal Protection Clause and it did not violate the
Supremacy Clause, which the two — at least the second one,
the issue of the Supremacy Clause, is the viable issue here
unless there are procedural difficulties to that*
After the case had been decided by the Montana Supreme
Court, the State of Montana then notified the three-judge
federal court and moved for a summary judgment0

The government

then pointed out that it had the right of direct appeal to
this Court.

This Is in the spring of 1973.

appeal was actually filed to this Court,

And a notice of

As of that time, if

this matter had been heard by this Court in 19733 the same
issues would have been presented or presentable to this Court
as now appear here, namely whether or not the Act, the Montana
Act does or does not violate the Supremacy Clause®

As of that

s
time,, however., Fresno had not been decided, but Phillips v.
Dumas was the law of the land in this aspect0
As soon as the notice of appeal to this Court was
filed, there was another stipulation again to continue the
matter, and the order of the Court was made, of the federal
court directing that the matter just be continued until there
was a, final disposition by appeal to the United States Supreme
Court or otherwise.

As I say, the appeal was filed and then

the United States, at the direction of the then Solicitor
General, Mr, Erwin N. Griswold, directed the dismissal of the
appealo
QUESTION;

Does the state know why that decision was

made ?
MR. POORE:

No, Your Honor, the state does not know,

I would like to speculate as to why.

They just wanted, they

felt very strongly that they wanted 'another trial de novo in
the federal court if they could get it, because of the status
of the fact of the matter having been decided adversely to
them at that stage„
QUESTION:

I take it the State of Montana knew all

the time that the United States was the real party in interest?
MR. POORE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The way that came about

is at the end — I tried the case in the county court0

At the

end of the case — well, first of all, the Court should be
apprised that as soon as it appeared that the matter was going

10
to be tried in the state court, the State of Montana moved to
strike those allegations in the state action that pertained to
the Federal Government itself, saying that it was irrelevant
since Kiewit x*as the named party in the state court action.
That was denied by the trial judge.

At the end of the case, I

and Mr, Sherman Lohn, who was then trying the case for Kiewit,
I raised the question of real party in interest, and I said
the true real party in interest is the United States Government*
Mr. Lohn, and he conceded that, but both of us to get the matter
expedited and proceed on through and have a determination of it
just agreed that the United .States Government was the real
party in interest but that the matter would proceed under the
Kiewit denomination.
QUESTION;
MR.

P.00RE:

Who did Mr. Lohn represent?
He represented Kiewit and was paid by the

U.S. Government.
QUESTION:

Is it stipulated in the findings in the

agreed statement that he was paid by the U.S. Government?
MR. POORE:

Yes, the agreed statement of fact that all

costs of the Kiewit litigation would be paid by the Federal
Government, that determined the strategy, control the strategy
of the case, paid all the costs, including costs of appeal.
QUESTION:

Does the record show that If Kiewit had

prevailed, whether the United States would have obtained a
refund?

II
MR. POORE;
QUESTION:

If Kiewit had prevailed. Your Honor, what?
Does the record show that the government

would have obtained a refund?
MR. POORE:

If Kiewit had prevailed, then there would

have been a refund, of course.
QUESTION:
MR0 POORE:

To whom?
Well, that is a rather complex qust ion

because that case was tried on the Libby Dam contract, and the
Libby Dam contract had a Clause 58 that provided that the con­
tractor, namely Kiewit, would not take advantage of the refunds
and credits, which was a very strange provision, and then that
was withdrawn by the government»

But I would say that the

refund would have to have been paid first to Kiewit and then I
presume that it would have been passed on down to the owner of
the property, namely the United States Government.
Again, I would like in an argumentative sense point
out that 1 think the reason that Mra Solicitor General Griswold
directed the dismissal of the action was to endeavor to get a
retrial in the federal court system, and as it turned out it
was an advantageous result, but we feel that it was not justi­
fied or justifiable that they had by then waived their right to
return to the federal court»
So after the appeal was dismissed in the summer of
*73, the State of Montana again moved for summary judgment and
cited the England rule and also raised the questions of

12
collateral estoppel and both of these motions were denied by
the federal court below» and the court then proceeded to hear
the trial of the ease.
The lower court held here that under the Fresno County
ruling» that revenue from the state tax which goes only to the
State of Montana, of course» since it is a state tax, and does
not flow over to the Federal Government, that in itself creates
an unconstitutional imbalance in that it violates the Supremacy
Clause»

This, of course, is the issue that the amici curiae

are very disturbed about»
I don’t think it would be possible to read the Fresno
County case, to study it and justify that particular holding.
The lower court also held that the England rule did not bar the
relitigation in the federal court, even though the litigation
in the state court covered the same issues as in the federal
court and had gone to the portals of the United States Supreme
Court before being dismissed and could have been with probable
jurisdiction since it was granted in this case, it could have
been granted in 1973 and the same Issues would have been deter­
mined by this Court and not required a retrial in the federal
court,
QUESTION:

Doesn't England though require that the

case start out in the federal court and then both parties
voluntarily submit their claims to the state court, the state
then reserve their federal claims?

13
MR* POORE:

I don’t think, Your Honor, that

England

requires that the actions start in the federal court,

I think

the rationale of England is that there is a federal court
action and that there are constitutional issues as to which
there should be a determination by the state court*

And here

there is already a week earlier pending action in the state
court, and I think this Court would be interested that in 1965
the State of Montana had thrown out as unconstitutional an
earlier act that would be the immediately predecessor act to
this, and it was thrown out on the grounds that there was dis»
crimination between in-state and out-of-state contractors*

But

the Montana Supreme Court recognising the problem of collection
of taxes in Montana, had in effect urged or invited the legis­
lature to come up with a constitutional solution to this
problem, so this Act came up and so it was obviously very right
for determination by the Montana Supreme Court as to whether
this particular Act was or was not constitutional, the second
try, so to speak*
QUESTION:

But 3?ou are not arguing that the govern­

ment’s agreement for a continuance of the federal court litiga­
tion amounted to a stipulation that the federal court should
abstain under the England aets are you?
MR, POORE:

Yes, that is just what I ~ there again,

I was an attorney present, we had made our motion for an
abstention, we met before the court commenced in hearing that

morning , and the Federal Government said we will *»- we didn't
unfortunately use the word "abstain,” we said continued, but to
us it is a matter of semantics.
QUESTION:
quite different.

Well, I think the meaning to me would be

A defendant could move that a plaintiff's

complaint be dismissed ten days prior to trial, on trial date
you come in and stipulate that the trial be continued for two
months.

That isn't the same thing as stipulating that it be

dismissed.
MR® POORE:

Did I say that we moved to have It dis­

missed?
QUESTION:

No, you say it is semantical as between

continuance and agreeing that there should be England doctrine
abstention.
MR® POORE:

I didn't mean to say that the government

agreed that they would be out of court if by virtue of this
continuance we automatically apply the England®
on what happened in the state court.

It all depended

But I do believe that the

matter was continued to obtain a determination in the state
court and the mechanics of that agreement fully complies with
the doctrine of England because there'was a submission of all of
the issues by the Federal Government to the state court for
determination, they are in control of the case and they are the
real party in interest, and then when it went adversely they
sought to return to the federal court, and I think they had as

15
of that time waived the right to return to the federal court
under England,,
The holding of the majority below, their main point
was that the Act was unconstitutional under the lower court's
interpretation of Fresno which we feel is in error,,

Secondly,

they held that the rule of England didn't bar relitigation in
the federal court, and the lower court also held that the
doctrine of collateral estoppel doesn't bar relitigation in the
federal court.
The dissent of Judge Kilkenny, of course, points up
the issues before this Court because he felt that there was
this grey procedural problem that the doctrine of England had
precluded return to the federal court, that collateral estoppel
did bar litigation and that the majority had misapplied the
Fresno County case.
Because of the dialogue between the Court and counsel
this morning, I will jump over the first procedure1
that is raised by England and collateral estoppel and get into
the merits of the case on Fresno, that Fresno County was mis­
construed by the lower court*
We respectfully submit that the doctrine of the hold­
ing of Fresno County fully supports the constitutional validity
under the Supremacy Clause of this Montana Act in question.
Of course, Fresno is based upon the ancient ease of
M’Culloch v. Maryland, and the rule of Fresno as updated —

16
excuse mes the rule of M’Culloch as updated by Dravo, which
was decided in 1937, and Phillips Chemical in I960 and Fresno
County just less than two years ago, stands for the proposition
that a state tax with economic impact on the United States is
not unconstitutional if the economic impact is not direct, and
here it was not direct, there was no tax upon any instrumental­
ity of the government, any property of the government, it is
not substantial, it is half of one percent —in Dravo, it was
a 2 percent tax— if the tax is not discriminatory,
QUESTION:

Do you think, counsel, that the Supremacy

Clause and what has been referred to in some of our eases as
the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity are interchange­
able?
MR. POORE:

Yes, I believe that as soon as there is a

question of intergovernmental tax immunity, if there is Impact
on the federal government I think we have a supremacy issue,
QUESTION:

Well, supremacy often involves a preemption.

The Supremacy Clause is at least broader than intergovernmental
tax Immunity, is it not?
MR. POORE:
QUESTION:

It is —
Governmental tax immunity might be one

aspect of the Supremacy Clause„
MR. POORE:

Yes.

My understanding of supremacy Is

that there cannot — that a state cannot take any action which
could embarrass the Federal Government in the proper performance

17
of its functions and any aspect of —
QUESTION:

The Supremacy Clause as such means in some

context different than other things, doesn’t it?
MR. POORE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Preemption, for example, which is not here

at all, is it?
MR* POORE:

Mo, there is no issue of preemption.

That

I think brings up the confusion at least of the tax adminis­
trators in the western states initially under what did discrim­
ination mean, because in 1937s under Dravo, just the bald word
♦

'’discrimination*5 seemed to connote a 14th Amendment due process
discrimination-, but Phillips Chemical indicated that it was much
broader than that, and this Court indicated in cases where
there was a potential conflict between the sovereigns, between
a sovereign state and the nation that the language that would
be found in equal protection clauses
controlling.

would not be necessaily

Fortunately, then Fresno County came along and it

seems to us that that has clarified at least in this area that
we are concerned with here what does discrimination mean where
there is a state tax with potential economic impact upon the
Federal Government.
Of course, the initial holding of that ease which the
lower court didn’t apparently recognize Is that there must be
a political check available amongst the constituents of a par­
ticular state such that there can’t be a ganging up on the

18
Federal Government such that the State of Montana would have
Inhibitions in endeavoring to up the tax such that there would
be adverse economic impact on the Federal Government,
What are the protections against that in our Act?

The

important thing is to point out that there are these multitudin­
ous statewide irrigation districts9 flood control districts.,
soil conservation districts, lighting districts.

I myselfP my

home is subject to a lighting district0 where private Individuals
get together, organise under allowable state lav? to create an
improvement district for their own properties and then assess or
make their own personal property subject to the repayment of
the costs of the improvements.
Now, all construction under such districts would be
subject to this tax.

The irrigation district itself would be

precisely in the same position as the Federal Government in its
construction of property.

In other words, the contractor

building the irrigation district would pay identical tax as
the contractor building an irrigation district for the Federal
Government.

The passed-on impact of the tax would be identical

to the irrigation district organised by the small group of
private property owners as would be the impact on the Federal
Government.
QUESTION:

When you say an Irrigation district as

organised by a small group of private property owners, when it
Is organised it becomes a public entity?

MR* POORE:

That is exactly right, Your Honor.

Montana is TOO miles long and -SGO miles wide.

part of the state and we will have a flood control district in

as upon the Federal Government, and the owners of that district,

that the required political check that was set forth in the
Fresno County case is here in our Montana Act.

is no feedback whatever, Your Honor, of —
QUESTION:

Suppose it were a municipality, would your

answer be the same?
MR, POORE:

Yes, the municipalities have to rise or

fall or stand on their own revenues.

There is no identification

of a municipality with the State of Montana.

If in the City of

Butts we are considering building a new city hall, that will be
a perfect example.

It will cost the citizens of the City of

Butte one-half of one percent of passed-on tax to build a new
city hall,
QUESTION:

Does the city get any direct allocation

from the contractor's tax that is taken by the state?
MR. POORE:

No, there is absolutely no feedback.

The

tax — the contractor would pay the tax to the state and there
would be no feedback to the city of Butte or to any of these
irrigation districts.

There is no identification of these funds

that the Federal Government is concerned about.

The city would

be in identically the same position as the Federal Government
Also the other rule we would submit of the Fresno County ease
that the contractors would be no worse off than other similarly
situated.

The contractors for the State of Montana, all of

these for the city, the irrigation districts, et cetera, all
are in the same position.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,

Mr® Smith, yon

may proceed®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A® SMITH, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR, SMITH:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

In our view, the starting

point of analysis of any

intergovernmental immunity question must, of course, be this
Court*s celebrated deeisionin M'Culloch v® Maryland.

There the

state imposed a tax on the issuance of notes by "a.ny bank
established without authority from the state.”

The only bank

that fit that description was the Bank of the United States,
and this Court, speaking through the great Chief Justice,
struck down that tax on the authority of Article VI of the
Constitution, the so-called Supremacy Clause which declares
that this Constitution and the laws of the United States shall
be the supreme laws of the land®

23
The Court holding of M* Culloch is that the states and
localities cannot directly tax the United States or impose
taxes the legal Incidence of which falls upon the United States
But there is a corollary tax immunity principle that the Court
has derived from M* Culloch,, the so-called discrimination
principle which is at issue here3 and that is that a tax may be
invalid even though it does not fall directly upon the United
States if it operates so as to discriminate against the govern­
ment or those with whom it deals.

And two terms ago, in United

States ve County of Fresno, the Court reaffirmed this aspect of
the teaching of M’Culloch.
The County of Fresno involved a county tax on
possessory interests of those who leased improvements in taxexempt land.

The Court upheld the tax on the federal leasees

who were employees of the United States Forest Service, and In
so holding the Court observed that federal leasees were no
worse off under California tax laws than those who rented
houses in the private sector.

The fact that the private

leasees were also subject to the tax, albeit indirectly through
their rents, meant that the tax in the Court’s view did not
threaten to destroy the federal function so as to run afoul of
the policies underlying the Supremacy Clause.
The critical statement in our view of what the Court
did in County of Fresno is set out at page 462 of Volume 429The Court said the rule to be derived from the Court’s more

recent decisions then is that the economic burden are on a
federal function of the state tax imposed on those who deal
with the federal government does not render the tax unconsti­
tutional so long as the tax is imposed equally on the other
similarly situated constituents of the state0
QUESTION;

Mr, Smith, before you proceed, just so I

am sure I can fully follow and understand your argument, do you
rely or are you going to rely at all on that part of Judge
East's reasoning that has the amicus so stirred up?
MR © SMITH;

No,

Judge East, I think as Mr, Poor

problems with this tax Is that the Federal Government didn't

QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;

Exactly0
Right, and we don't rely on that.
That is what stirred up the amicus brief.
We don't rely on that at all.

What we

rely on is the distinction between private contractors and the
public contractors.

25
QUESTION:

That was my understanding from the brief,

and I xfanted to be sure of that understanding,
MR. SMITH:

Exactly*

Applying the rule of County of

Fresno, as I extracted it from the Court’s opinion, we submit
that the Montana tax at issue in this case is invalid and can­
not pass constitutional muster.

It is a tax, as has already

been described, of one percent of gross receipts of public
contracts, and the statute further defines public contractor as
"any person who enters into a contract performing all public
construction work in the state with the Federal Government, the
State of Montana, or with any other public board, body, commis­
sion or agency authorised to let or award contracts for any
public work when the contract costs exceed $1,000."
So by its terms, the Montana statute applies a tax to
those contractors who perform services for the Federal Govern­
ment.

But a contractor who performs the same services for a

private party is not subject to the tax.

In our view, this tax

is therefore not — and to harken back to what the Court said
in County of Fresno, "imposed equally on the other similarly
situated constituents of the state" because federal contractors
are, unlike the California, unlike the Forest Service leasees
in County of Fresno, worse off than their counterparts who work
in the private sector.

The private sector don’t pay the tax,

the public contractors do.
QUESTION:

You concede, don’t you, that people other

26
than federal contractors are liable for the tax?
MRo SMITH:

Absolutely, we doB

Public contractors

Include contractors who work for the state and contractors who
work for these local localities.
QUESTION:

What if the tax were made applicable as a

tax In Alabama v. King & Boozer was» to all contractors, but
had the same exemption here for contracts under $1,000, and the
Federal Government came in and said it Is in fact discriminatory
against us because we never enter into any contracts that are
under $1,000, and many private individuals do?
MRo SMITH:

It would seem to me —

QUESTION: Suppose the Federal Government were able to
make out its claim that they never did enter into any contracts
under $1,000?
MR. SMITH:

But I think, Mr„ Justice,, it would depend

also on what kind of contracts in the private sector, you know,
in the non-federal sector were let for more than $1,000, and
that
QUESTION:

Well, suppose one were let for $900 and

one for $1,100, and they were very much the same except one
was a little bigger than the other?

2?
MRo SMITH:
trying to say.

No, no, no, you misunderstand what I was

In other words, the fact that the —- I think

that the fact that the Federal. Government didn’t let any con­
tracts for less than $1,000 wouldn’t carry the day for the
discrimination case.

It would depend in part I think as to

how the tax operated in the non-federal sphere, and there are a
lot of private contracts for less than $1,000.
QUESTION:

You concede then that there may be some

discriminatory impact upon the Federal Government that is not
felt by private entities similarly situated, if you would allow
a line to be drawn at $1,000?
MR. SMITH:

I suppose I do.

But it seems to us that

the point that we think is critical here is the fact that a
very — in our view, a very significant group is excluded from
the operation of the tax, it is not done in terms of, you know,
dollars but rather it is done in terms of the fact that private
contractors are simply excluded from the tax.

Mr. Poore has

painted a picture at the beginning of his argument which I must
tell the Court is really not borne out by the record at all.
I mean, there is really nothing in the record that suggests
that there is no private construction activity in Montana.
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

He didn’t say that.
No, he didn’t say that, but —
He said it was moderate.
— that there was a moderate amount.

You

23
sees the record really doesn’t talk about how much the relative
volumes of private versus public construction work exists in
Montana.

I think we have to take it, take the statute on its

face.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t the burden on you then to show

that it is discriminatory?
MR. SMITH:

Well, we think that we have made at that

burden by the fact that the Federal Government — in fact, to
the extent that there are statistics in the record, Mr. Justice,
we think that they demonstrate a large amount of federal
activity.
QUESTION:

Don’t you also have to show a very small

amount, a very large amount of private activity?

If Mr. Poore’s

version is correct, there just isn’t too much private contract­
ing on a large scale done In Montana.

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It is either done by the state or by the

federal government, and therefore the state was justified in
lumping together these entities and saying that they were going
to have to pay a tax, whereas contractors employed by private
entities were just kind of on a much lesser scale and could be
treated differently.
MR. SMITH:

Well, 1 think the statistics really refute

that simply because, if I may refer the Court to page 5S foot­
note 3 of our brief, we state here, the record indicates that

29
federal projects accounted for at least 65.8 percent of the
amount of gross receipts tax collected and for at least 57.2
percent of the balanced retained after credits.
figures do not include all federal projects,,

However, these

In fact, there are

a number of federal — there are a number of state projects that
are funded by the Federal Government, so in effect the Federal
Government *»QUESTION:

That could have been true in King & Boozer,

too?
MR. SMITH:

In fact, it may well be,

I think that it

seems to us that under the rule of County of Fresno that the
Court review that case as establishing a rule that requires the
Court to scrutinize a state statute and to look at It and say
are all similarly situated constituents of the state taxed
equally.

And in this particular case, you know, it leaps out

from the page, the fact that private contracting activity is not
subject to the tax.
QUESTION:

In Fresno, the Court said that you need a

political check against the abuse.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Righto
And Mr. Poore’s answer to your claim is

that the numerous municipal corporations and their constituents
form a political cheek,
MRo SMITH:

I think that the fact that the Federal

Government may be joined or that the tax base may include —

30

let me back up for a moment»

Of course, if you have a fax that

is only on federal contracting activity, it is very plain that
that falls on one side of — that that falls on the wrong side
of the line.
Now, if you start adding to that the tax base and
include, say, here state contractors, we would say, as we
pointed out in the brief in further detail, that really doesn’t
change the picture dramatically or from a constitutional point
of view because of the fact that these taxes are sort of
charged by the state but in effect the contractor charges them
back to the state»
In other xrords, it seems to me that his case, the
state’s ease, if it has to stand and fall on the addition of
these local, you know, contracting activities, it seems to me
it really depends upon your perspective»

If you want to say -»

I don’t think that the record here demonstrates or it really
can be demonstrated in any logical sort of way a* to wb"'-5'
of political check the local contracting activity would con­
stitute to protect the Federal Government»
1 prefer to view it from the other side of the
spectrum and say that a significant amount of contracting
activity which I think really has to be conceded as similarly
situated»

I don’t think that the state really seriously argues

here, as indeed I don’t think it can, that private contracting
activity Is not similarly situated.

In fact, in Kiewit, if I

31
may just refer the Court to the fact that the rationale of the
Montana Supreme Court offered four different reasons for why it
thought that private contracting activity was different, and
they are as followss that defective public works to expose the
public at-large to danger, that public contractors have to be
experienced9 that public contractors have to put up a bond, and
that public works usually involve elaborate plans, architect’s
specifications, and mandatory inspections»
1 submit to the Court — and I don't think the state
would quarrel with that «— that these distinctions have no bear­
ing as to tax classifications but simply go to the competence
of a particular contractor to do a job»
QUESTIONS
argument?

So —

Mr, Smith, how do you meet Mr. Poore’s

He didn’t make that argument, I realize, but his

argument is that every school, every local construction project
by a local body is in the last analysis paid for by taxes
assessed against local real estate or the local citizens, and
that is what provides your political check.
MR. SMITH:

Well, there is nothing in the record that

indicates that that —
QUESTION*

Well, the statute does tell us — every

contractor built school would be covered, wouldn’t it?
MR» SMITH:

Every contract to build a school would be

pay for those schools?

Right.

MR. SMITH:

were being treated the same way as

33
the federal leasees in County of Fresno, and for the Court I
think that carries the day, the fact that essentially, you know,
looking at it under the spectrum, everybody was treated the
same»

Here I think it is plain that everybody is not treated

the same*
Now, 1 think in a way it makes the Court’s job easier
to end the matter there than to start having to weigh the relative political clout or the political check of a particular
segment of the state economy»

It seems to me that the interests

of the Supremacy Clause is such — Mr. Justice9 you said earlier
that this is not an equal protection case, and I heartily agree
with that.

It is not an equal protection case.

In fact, the

Court in Phillips said that equal protection decisions were not
controlling when the Federal Government’s tax immunity is at
stake.

It seems to us that the standard is much stricter and

that when you have a significant element of the economic sector
which is immune from a tax that the Federal Government has to
pay, I think that really that ends the matter and it eliminates
the need for having to judge the political check of any particu­
lar person, because one can foresee endless amounts of litiga­
tion and fact-finding as to whether people exercise sufficient
political clout in a particular instance.
It seems to me that the easier way to sort of approach
this case is to simply say — is to examine the tax base and
say is there a significant interest that is excluded from the

3^

tax, so that the Federal Government in effect is discriminated
against by being treated less well than a similarly situated
constituent,

1 think really that is the easy way to do it0

1

know the Court has moved a long way from Alabama v. King &
Boozer from the economic burden test, but it seems to us that
the core of what is left of federal tax immunity is this dis­
crimination point that the Court reaffirmed in County of Fresno,
and on that basis we think this tax is invalid.
I think it is invalid, you know, and I think the fact
that the state contractors are added to it, although we suggest
that that really is economically illusory in a way, and Mr®
Justice Stevens actually explored those illusory aspects in
your dissenting opinion in County of Fresno.

But it seems to

us that the critical fact is this exclusion of a large class of
similarly situated private parties.
I would like, if I may, to use the remaining few
minutes of my time to ~ if the Court has some questions about
the so-called procedural bars which I really think are not
controlling here.

QUESTION:

#1.

Because if you haven®t addressed it, I

35
would ask it.
MR. SMITH:

There were two reasons why the government

did not seek certiorari in Klewit #1, and it seems to us that
they really bear on why these doctrines don’t apply.

And that

is, to begin with, Kiewit #1 dealt with a kind of contract
which is no longer involved in this litigation, a contract in
which the government forbad its contractor from taking the
credits, and the Supreme Court of Montana said, and not without
justification, that indeed the whole tax may be a washout, and
as a result we don’t really have —- in fact, if this tax is
creditable in full agin st other Montana tax liability, the tax
is & washout,

Why did the government pursue that policy?

with for quite some time.

I mean, there are a lot of things that are pussling in

this area as well as other areas.

In any event, the point is.

36
really two reason8s Mr. Justice®

Number one, the Supreme Court

of Montana we believe decided the case on a factual assumption
that no longer exists; and, secondly, that this contracts clause
no longer exists.

So while I was not privy to the decision,

I have been advised that really for these two reasons the case
was not regarded as an attractive one to bring to this Court.
QUESTION;

I take it you concede that that litigation,

however, was the U»S« Government’s, lock, stock and barrel?
MR0 SMITH;

The U.S. Government did, and I think it

is concede, finance that litigation and appeared as amicus in
the state courts.

But the fact that it did that, it does not

seem to us triggers either the rule of England v® Medical
Examiners or the doctrine of collateral estoppel®

MR, SMITH:

Well, I am not sure that is so, Mr.

have that contract provision in operations it would seem that
the Court really would have to view the tax as in effect a
real tax as opposed to — in other words, the Court more or

that it may not even apply to anybody,

It is true that the

Act and practice to date has not resulted in a total washout of

As a result, now

its contractors from taking advantage of credit, and in fact
there would be this cost, this tax is now a real tax, in a way
that it arguably was not in Kiewit, and that change and circum­
stans, you know *«- the Court has said in Southern that the
doctrine of collateral estoppel has to be confined when the

Could we have attacked the tax —
On the same ground you are using now?

In

their view they viewed it as a case that really was a lot of
puff and smoke about, you know, what was essentially nothing.
What we have got now is a real tax, a small one but a real one.
QUESTION:

What pussies me about this argument is

MR® POORE;
revenue.

First of all, the tax does generate

The opinion of the Supreme Court in Klewlt #1 was

that the infancy of the administration of the tax and also the
infancy of the Kiewit building of the dam in question and that
subsequently turned out that the tax does generate, as is
stipulated, one-half of one percent, so there is only one-half
of one percent that is revenue enforcing, and there is a tax.
Justice White, there is an overlap.

The funds that

would be repayable to the state under the stipulation that is
set forth at page 51 of the appendix to the jurisdictional
statement requires the retention of all license fees collected
after that date, which is May of ’71, and at that time the
Libby Bam was in its infancy.
On the question of the statement of counsel that
requires as a rule of Fresno a determination of who is excluded,
rather than a determination of who is similarly situated, we
do not think that that is either the rule of M’Culloch or the
rule of Fresno.

In Fresno, there were other taxpayers — the

tax did not fall, for example, on renters of private tax-free

45
property, rental of a church or a tax-free school would not be
included under the tax,

It is a question of degree.

As

Justice Powell summarized it9 it seems to me that that would
be it*

In other words* is there an adequate protection in the

voters of Montana* the constituents of Montana to provide that
there cannot be any ganging up on the Federal Government.
One final point.

It seems to us that it is important

that we explain why the private contractor was left out in the
first place.

First of all* as I tried to explain in the

initial part of my argument* we were trying to catch and tax
the floating taxpayer who had been brought in by these larger
public and state and. federal contracts* and the local person
had never traditionally posed that problem*
Secondly* the administrative cost of having every
guy who builds a garage that is more than $1*000 or a barn that
is more than $1*000 and having them go through tie process and
all for one-half of one percent in net tax is not justified.
And where there is enough constituent impact* as we respectfully
submit there is* there is no

this tax is not unfair to the

Federal Government.
There are those who are identically situated to the
Federal Government who would be up in arms* in school districts
and on and on* if the tax impact were such as to be onerous
and oppressive.

In addition to that* there are the contractors

themselves who do not want their industry to be impacted by

oppressive taxation.

We believe that Fresno is fully met, that

our case is stronger than Fresno, and we respectfully submit
that the action should be reversed«
