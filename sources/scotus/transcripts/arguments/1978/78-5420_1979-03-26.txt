We will hear arguments

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. HELLERSTEIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR., HELLERSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These cases are before the Court on appeal from the
New York Court of Appeals, which by a vote of four to three sus­
tained the former and present New York arrest statutes which
allow arrest entries,even in the absence of non-exigent circum­
stances, into the home, and permit non-consentual and forcible
entry for the purpose of arrest
The two cases before the Court present the statutes
in two virtually comprehensive applications.

In the Payton

case, you have the forcible, and I would say extremely forcible,
entry without a warrant, namely the breaking down of Mr. Payton's
door with crowbars.
In the Riddick case, you have a non-consentual, but an
entry with less force, and I would say not exactly force, namely
the knocking on the door, the opening of the door by a three
year-old boy, the entry to arrest and the placing of the Defen­
dant, who was in bed, under arrest.
The facts leading up to both of these cases — In the
Paj/ton case, a hcmocide in the course of a robbery had been

cussion of investigating officers wife!

/Itnesses, to two da;

later the officer learning the name of Mr. Payton.
One of the informants or people who spoke with the
officer, took the police on January 14th, two days after the
»

crime, sometime in the afternoon took the officer to Payton's
huilding in the Bronx and pointed out his apartment to him.
That detective, Detective Malfer, the investigating detective,
made no effort, at that time, to arrest the Defendant.

Instead,

he came back and the following morning in the company
QUESTION:

Would it make a difference to your position

if he had made the arrest, made these steps right then and there9
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
for us, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think it would be a tougher case
I think it would ~~ because then, in

the course of that on-going situation, it -might be arguable by
the Prosecution that the circumstances were exigent, in the
sense that in the very first moment that Detective Malfer learned

j

where a suspected felon, for which he had a probable cause, lived,
he might then have possibly consummated the arrest.

i■

But that's

not what happened and I think that's -QUESTION:

Judge Wachler felt that way In the Court of

Appea Is ?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Judge Wachler was the only judge,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, who felt that way, who felt that this was

a continuous pursuit.
I would submit that the concept of continuous pursuit
is still not exactly a pursuit in exigent circumstances,
I don't think you even have to agree with Judge
Wachler on that.

I think that the concept of continuous pursuit

the Chief Justice' question ~~ if that were the case., it
would make it a tougher case.

I would not necessarily concede

that the circumstances were still exigent, but that's not this
case.
The fact of the Payton case is that?not having done
that,the officer chose to wait until the following morning, some
twelve or fourteen hours later, when accompanied by other offi­
cers, attempted to enter Payton's apartment, and not being able
to do so, still took additional time to call for assistance by
a call to the Emergency Services Division of the Police Depart­
ment who came with crowbars and broke the apartment open -- the
door of the apartment open.

And Mr. Payton was not there.

And,

even though Mr. Payton was not there, the officers ransacked the
apartment, searched in cupboards, drawers, closets, under a
mattress, knowing he was not there.
Everything that was'found was suppressed on consent
by the District Attorney, because it was, of course, illegally
seized in an unlawful search.
The one item of evidence that was not suppressed was a
30-caliber shell casing that was found, ostensibly in plain

6
view by Detective Ma'lfer and which matched shell casings found
at the scene of the crime.
The trial court and ultimately the Court of Appeals,
by a four to three vote, sustained the admissibility of that shell
casing on the ground that the officers were lawfully on the pre­
mises to consummate an arrest under New York's then Code of
Criminal Procedures, Section 177 and 173; they could break and
enter without a warrant.
The Riddick case, somewhat different, in the sense that
the officers had probable cause to believe that Mr. Riddick had
committed a robbery in 1971*

They had probable cause at least

two months before they went to his apartment.

I should say they

learned his address two months before they went to his apartment.
They had probable cause a lot earlier.
The arrest in Riddick was extremely typical.

No great

hurry, despite what the prosecution would call a violent crime.
They knew where Mr. Riddick was and waited two months.

The

prosecution concedes that there was nothing at all exigent about
the Riddick case.
That brings before the Court the constitutionality of
the statute.

The Court of Appeals, by a majority vote, I think

placed its emphasis on three concepts or items.

The first, that

an arrest entry is a much more substantial intrusion than an
entry for the purpose of a search, for which this Court has re­
quired warrants, and that the history of the common law, with

respect to arrest entries, was extremely well settled and clear
and supported the court's decision,' The court also placed an
emphasis on the existence of statutes similar to New York's in
many states, and upon the proposal of the American Lav/ Institute
not recommending a warrant be obtained in this particular circum­
stance.
It is our submission that the court erred in all three
respects,
QUESTION:

Mr, Hellerstein, you said that of the three

factors one of them was that the court's view that an arrest
entry was more intrusive or less intrusive?
MR, HELLERSTEIN:

Less intrusive.

I think the logical starting point for our argumentmust be the plurality opinion of this Court in Coolldge, where
at that time four members of the Court expressed the view that
a warrantless entry into a person's home to arrest was at odds
with the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment

per ne

requireiuent for sea rches.
QUESTION:

When you use the term "entry," Mr.Hellerstein,

supposing that in the Rlcldick case, for example, the police had
come up the steps onto a porch and the door had been opened -It hadn't been shut and then opened by a three year-old — and
simply on the steps they had seen Riddick in the house, in the
room in bed, as he was.

Would that be an entry?

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, I believe

a
it would.
entry.

It might be the most peaceable entry, but it would be

I think they would have had to obtain permission to cross

the threshold and come into Mr. Hiddick's room.
I think the views expressed in Coolidge, hopefully,
will be able to support the conclusion of our argument.
I think if there is one interest that has predominated
this Court's decisions, both in holding and in dicta, as I have
read them, it is that the expectation of privacy within the home
is the highest of its kind, that there is nothing more sancti­
fied, in our constitutional system, historically and juridically,
than that of privacy of the home is paramount.

It is a place

where people repair to enjoy in their utmost, their thoughts,
personal feelings, family life.
Although in Katz the Court spoke of the Fourth Amend­
ment protecting people, not places, I believe that was supple­
mental to the notion that the home is the place where the pri­
vate interest is at its highest.
With that as background ~~ and I am not so sure that
the Prosecution even disagrees with what I've said to that point
— the Court of Appeals, I think, erred grievously in about seven
different respects, in concluding that an arrest entry was less
substantial than one for purposes of a search.
When police enter private premises, that entry, first
of all,affects everybody in the premises, if there is family,
children.

The manner of the entry is not designed to insure the

9
privacy of the pe
their privacy,
I think we’ve pointed out in our briefs that actual
manuals, by recognized experts in police conduct and practice,
point out the nature of the way that entry should be made.

Both

Riddick, and Pay ton are exemplary cases of more than one officer
going.

They might still enter even though the door were open,

fan out, conduct the protective sweep, which is recommended by
the authorities and which I think is rather commonplace.

And

that is a substantial intrusion.
It is a substantial Intrusion because in conducting a
fan-out or a protective sweep, there Is immediately open to view
of the police whatever items, closely personal items , the occu­
pants of the premises have.

And I would say that even conducting

a search incident to that arrest, it is nonetheless a search of
a good deal of Intensity.
The search for a person, in your hypothetical, Mr.
Justice Rehnqulst, if the suspect is not in the-room that's open
to view, and even though the entry is across a threshold, without
the breaking of a door, but trie suspect is in a back room — or
even in the Warden case, where the Court saw a search for a
person that covered a multi-room house, that can be also an
extensive search for a person.
QUESTION:

Including a washing machine, in that case,

wasn't it?
MR. HELLExlSTEIN:

I believe it was.

So, as a general proposition, I think the intrusion for
purposes of arrest are not minimal and they are not less than
for-search.

In fact, I would submit, that there are occasions

when an entry for search can be far less intrusive.
In the two casei3 before the Court, I don't think you
can conclude that there was a minimal intrusion of any kind.

For

these types of intrusions, we submit that a ivarrant should be
required, that there is nothing in the interest of law enforcement

to preclude or to cut against requiring a vurrsart in these two

situations *
The last decision that this Court dealt with this
subject of warrants for arrest, of course, was the Watson case,
and this Court predicated its decision, as I read it, for dis­
pensing with the warrant, on several factors, the publicness of
the arrest, to wit, the liberty interest was not so substantial.
I think the Court of Appeals below in a majority pointed to that.
But in this case ~~ or these cases -- you have what is the pri­
vacy Interest as well.
It was a case in which Mr. Justice Powell said that
there were times that logic must defer to history and experience.
And because the history and experience of the common law, with
respect to public arrests, was what it was in Watson, the Court
felt that warrants should not be required for non-exigent — for
any public arrests.
I respectfully submit

and I think we try at great
i

length in our brief to establish that the common law with respect

,I

to entries into the home'to arrest without a warrant was a bird
of a different color.
In fact, I believe, the Court In an opinion by
Mr. Justice Brennan, in Miller v. United States, pointed,first
citing with approval Judge Prettyman's decision in Accarino v.
United States, which held that you had to have a warrant to enter,
but as a minimal proposition, pointed out the disarray among the

common lav sources> with respect to entries without a warrant.
QUESTION:

Wasn't the Miller case under a federal

statute?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

The Miller case was under 3109.* Title

18, Mr. Chief Justice.» and it did involve the issue of knocking or
announcing.

But in the course of the Court's analysis as to the

knock and announce statute, the common law source

with respect

to the general proposition of entry without warrant was exami-ned
and pointed out to be in substantial disarray.
In that disarray, we believe it does not afford the
Court the freedom, nor should it, to conclude that the Watson
line of analysis would be appropriate.

The disarray continued

beyond the common law into the 19th Century, and a number of
states passed statutes similar to ours, not requiring warrants.
Interestingly, once courts began to look at these
statutes and these practices under Fourth Amendment principles,
the predominant overwhelming weight of lower court judicial
authority, state and federal, has been to require warrants in
non-exigent circumstances.
1

The Second Circuit, in United States v. Reed, in a .
S

recent decision which the Court of Appeals just did riot feel ‘it
i

should follow, so held.

And the Courts of Appeals have pre-

dominated on that view.
The warrant requirement, in the context of entries for
home arrests, will not impose any substantial legitimate burden

on law enforcement,

ar

there la no reason for law officials, law enforcement officials,
not to obtain a warrant.

The basic concern of the Prosecution

is that in such a circumstance the requirement to obtain a
warrant will preclude catching dangerous criminals quickly.
I believe Mr. Justice White, in the Sherne’ll opinion,
you also expressed that concern.

The fact of the matter Is, as

I believe a Task Force report which was cited in our brief

with

respect to the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the
Administration of Justice, establishes^ that 50$ of the arrests
that are made throughout the country are made within two hours
of the crime.

Forty-five percent of the arrests, of the re­

maining 45, are made a day after the crime. ' That conclusion led
the Government in its brief in Santana, for example, to say it
could easily live with.a requirement of two hours, plus, for a
warrant.

And in the Government's brief in the Watson case,

itself, it pointed out that the FBI, as a practice, obtains
arrest warrants, whenever practicable, because it is in the
interest of the Government to secure a warrant, and that the
scrutiny as to probable cause, that the dangers of losing evi­
dence because of suppression are minimized by obtaining a warrant
We submit that the arguments presented by the Prosecu­
tion that this nonetheless would be a burden on law enforcement.

Mr. Zimroth,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER L. ZIMROTH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. ZIMROTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The community, the societal interest that is at stake
in this case -- in these cases ~~ is enormous.

What we are

talking about here is not simply gathering evidence, but bringing
the Eefendant to court, so that the civilizing processes of law
can even be brought to bear on that case.
This is, I believe, one of the first requirements of
any civilized society, the alternative to which is vigilante
justice.
This fundamental interest,that Is to have a court
bring the processes of law to bear, has been recognized through­
out history.

And that is why the judgment has been made through-

\
out history that it is better not to impose a lawyerized process
before the arrest, and that's regardless of where the arrest
takes place, but rather that it is better first to obtain cus~:
today of the defendant and then to construct a system whereby the
defendant is given all the processes he is due.
And it is a very elaborate system.

The defendant must

is tested.

Eventually his guilt or innocence

And, also, in this process, there is a review of the

arrest process itself.
We are not here suggesting the Fourth Amendment says
nothing about the arrest process.

Of course, it says a lot about

the arrest process.
QUESTION:

And the question in this ease is how much

and what does it say?
MR. ZIMROTH;
QUESTION:

That's exactly right.

And what do you think it says?

MR, ZIMROTH:

I think what it says is that you have to

show probable cause to make the arrest, and also, -although this
Court has not stated this is a constitutional matter, nonetheless
most states and common law history suggest that, if there is going
to be a forceable entry, the courts will, after the defendant is,
in custory, determine whether or not the police made an attempt,
a proper attempt, to avoid the necessity for the forceable entry,
that is, by knocking and announcing their authority.
And if the police behave unlawfully very, very severe
consequences attach to that.
QUESTION:

The question is what is unlawful? isn't it?

I mean that's the question in this case.
MR. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

That's right.

You concede there must be probable cause,

and I gather you have just conceded that there is a duty to

minimise the forceabllity of the entry, and beyond that,
nothing* for a person inside his own house?
MR, ZIMROTH;

Well* 1 think that there might be special

concerns in certain areasj that is. if it were a nighttime arrest,
I think, it might be a special situation.
QUESTION:

If it were at nighttime, what additionally

would be required by the Constitution?
MR, ZIMROTH:

It is conceivable, though no court has

The question in this

All I am saying is that, by

saying a warrant is not required, if the Court so holds, that
that is not the same as saying the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply,
that there are other protections that the Fourth Amendment imposes
on this situation.

X.e., there has to be probable cause.

The exclusionary rule, for one, and court actions
And I am suggesting that this is a debate that

Mr. He'lierstein and I are having that has been a debate throughout
history, that is, exactly the same terms of the debate, that is,
the privacy of the home, on the one hand, and on the other hand
the tremendous public interest in bringing a suspected felon,
about whom there is probable cause to believe that he has com­
mitted a felony, to justice.
And the judgment of history, which I think is relevant
to the issue of whether or not the Constitution requires a rarrart,
has been uniform in this respect.

No prior judicial screening

has been required.
Mr. Hellerstein says that there is a big dispute at
the common law, and I think he is making an understandable, but
nonetheless an apparent error in that respect,

And that is that

there were disputes about what sort of showing a police officer
had to make after the arrest.

Some of the common law authorities

said that all you had to do was show probable cause in order to
relieve yourself of liability.

Others said that you had to show

that a felony was actually committed.

And a few said that you

had to show that the defendant was actually guilty.
QUESTION:

When you said that there had to be an

effort to minimize the use of force, are we to take that as
meaning that you are drawing on the reasonableness, the term

20

"unreasonable" in the Fourth Amendment?
MR.. ZIMROTH:
QUESTION:

Yes. I am, Your Honor,

Well, then, going to the midnight search --

2:00 o'clock in the morning when presumably most people have
their house closed, they are asleep, what do you say about

I would have to say it would depend on

the case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No, just take that much,

dark, everyone asleep.
MR. ZIMROTH:

I would have to say that in the circum­

stances of the Payton case that that would be reasonable entry,
because —
QUESTION:

Isn't there some case in which there was

an observation made ~~ not by this Court but by, perhaps, one of
the Courts of Appeals or State Supreme Courts, that that type of
a breaking and entering might produce the deaths of some police
officers.
MR. ZIMROTH:

Which is why, I. think, the balance is

a little different in a nighttime entry than it is in the day­
time entry.
I should say that the judgment that I am talking about
about the reasonableness of entering without a warrant is not
only uniform throughout history, but it is the judgment made in

Or is it not only an arrest warrant tut a

that there need to be only.an arrest warrant.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER L. ZIMROTH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE (Resumed)
MR, ZIMROTH:

Mr, Hellerstein blithely assumes that

there would be no serious practical consequences if this Court
imposes a warrant requirement.
The basic problem with a warrant requirement is that,
in essence, it imposes a review mechanism on a situation that in
the gross, in most cases or in many cases is very fluid and very
volatile.
QUESTION:

I didn't understand your friend to be sug­

gesting that a warrant must be obtained in every case, just be­
cause time would permit it.
MR. ZIMROTH:

Well, if I may say so. Your Honor,

earlier this morning he criticized the police in the Payton
case for not, in effect, getting a warrant after the building
was pointed out to them.

And I think if there were a warrant

requirement there would be a pressure on them to get a warrant
at that time,
You might ask, why didn't they get a warrant at that
time, assuming that there had been a warrant requirement?
At that time, first of all, they did not know that the

Marshall's question?

I would say, though, that if you

compare the federal system and the state system it raises another
problem.

And that is the problem of resources.

We are talking

about, in this case, imposing a warrant requirement not on the
FBI or the BEA or the Assistant United States Attorney, but upon
approximately more than 20,000 police departments throughout the
United States.

MR. ZIMROTH:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

it is a question of resources, but it's a question of different
problems in different areas.

We are dealing with fifty states

QUESTION:

don't you go the whole hog while you are at it?

Why

Some counties

might not even have a judge that could issue a warrant.
MR. ZIMROTH:

I am not aware of that, but If it is

true,'then it is a very serious problem.
QUESTION:

There are many counties in the United

States that have no judge.
MR. ZIMROTH:
In that respect.

Well, then it is a very serious problem

And the important thing is that we are standing

here after the event.
QUESTION:

What I am talking about .is a place that has

more than one judge who is available and you don't have to travel
86,000 miles.
MR. ZIMROTH:

That's true, but It still takes a sub­

stantial period of time. And the more important factor than that.
Your Honor, is that it seems to me unfair to judge a warrant re­
quirement after everything has solidified.

That's why the ques­

tion about the indictments is not a fair question, because when
an Indictment is issued all the evidence has been gathered and
it is presented to a body.

We are talking about imposing a

warrant requirement in the on-going investigative stages.
QUESTION:

All those things are true about a search

warrant, aren't they?
MR. ZIMROTH:

They are true about the search warrant.

29
but there are several very important differences*
the difference of numbers.

The first is

In New York County last year there

were approximately 500 search warrants issued in New York County.
There were 30^000 felony arrests in New York County.
QUESTION:

All of them, or the majority of them* in

people,'s homes?
MR. ZIMRGTH:

No* Your Honor* but the important point

is that the police will not know in advance whether they are
going to find a defendant in his home or not.

Any time that the

arrest is substantially after the commission of the crime* it­
self, the police -- the home is naturally a logical place to
check.

So it seems to me under a warrant requirement they will

have to get that.
Mr. Hellerstein cites a study* which we also cite in
our brief* which indicates that about half of the felony arrests
are made more than two or three hours after the commission of
the crime.

So* we are talking about potentially a universe of

15,000 cases* not three or four hundred cases.

I suppose if they had the warranty

they could go right in?
MR. ZIMRGTH:

be valid/ but the arrest would still be illegal/ because, it
seems to me, that regardless of warrant requirement, the police
need probable cause to believe that the person is in his home
— or in a given location -- before they can bust in.

But an arrest warrant is a command.
QUESTION:

I understand that* so is a search warrant.

You mean to say every time, you get a search warrant you must

MR. ZIMROTH:

No* but the realities of the situation

are that the police -- and I overstate it by saying that they
know he is not guilty.

They may have some doubts in their minds.

Instead of allowing them to do further investigation* the arrest
warrant requirement will pressure them* will be an additional
pressure for them to make the arrest.

The point is that any

exigent circumstances exception is bound to be quite unclear.
If you look at what's happening in the various states* that's

34
exactly what's happening.

In some states* like in California*

there is an exigent circumstances exception that is applied so
strictly that the police wait literally ten minutes before they
go in and make the arrest. Then the courts say they should have
gotten a warrant.

That's the People v, Ellers case* which we

cite in our brief.

And that also is a very

It's an unhealthy situation because it

doesn't give any guidance to the police* and it's an unhealthy
situation because eventually those cases may influence the
exigent circumstance exception in the search area* which would
be very unfortunate.
I think that the basic point that I want to make here
is that you can always think of situations and cases where you
could say* well* the police should have time to get a warrant*
or they didn't have time to get a warrant.

But all of those are

going to be situations in which we are sitting after the event

MR * ZIMROTH:
— in a sense

But you don't require the police to

in the midst of their investigation

review

the evidence before they make the arrest.
QUESTION:

That's only if they want to make the arrest

in a home?
MR. ZIMROTH:

But they are not going to know in ad~

vance whether they are going to be in the home* so that the re­
quirement is going to have more effect than simply arrests that
are made in the home.
I think that it is these kinds of problems which are
very difficult to get your hands on* because investigations are*
]

by their nature* of an infinite variety.

For this very reason*

I think* that until Coolldge there had been a uniform judgment
not to impose an arrest warrant requirement on the police.

And

\

the people who came to that conclusion- were not people who were
insensitive to the concerns of privacy in the home.

They were

the very same people who created the protections which later
\

became the protections embodied in the Fourth Amendment.
I see I only have a few more minutes and I did want
to — a mention of Coolldge

brings me really to the second

point in the case* and that is until Coolldge was decided there
was very little* if anything* which could have given the police*
in the Payton case* any reason for going to get a warrant.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Just a few things, if it please the

C ourt:
Mr. Zimroth is simply wrong, I believe, when he tells
you clear out that there is a probable cause requirement for
believing that a person who is sought to be arrested in the
home must be in the home.

There is no such probable cause

requirement that he is at that moment in the home.
Our statute simply requires a reasonable belief that
he is at home.

And if you know that the man works at night

and you go to his horne at 4:00 in the morning with a warrant­
or without a warrant, you know he is not going to be home.
And that is what I think we are talking about.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hellerstein, it apparently is the

fact, concededly, that it is, in some situations, at least.
New York does habitually provide for arrest warrants, i.e..
grand jury warrants and bench warrants, if nothing else.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Let's assume a law enforcement officer

is armed with a grand jury warrant -- somebody has been in­
dicted in absentia.

MR, HOLLERS TOIN:

for any kind of an arrest, whether it's within the home or

MR, HELLkRSTEIN:

He must have reasonable belief.

he is at home at that moment.

And if you know the man's address

it is reasonable to infer that he will be home, and unless you
have facts to the contrary, as I tried to indicate.
I think that’s how the courts have dealt with that.
There is a Ninth Circuit case. I think the Phillips case was
decided by -- which 1 think is a rare case,

I think the general

cases* Toman and some Arizona cases that have dealt with the
issue say you do not have to have probable cause to believe that
he is in his home at that moment,
X think one of the main concerns* in the area of
entering premises* is when you are dealing with third-person
premises* namely* that you have to have probable cause to
believe the defendant is in somebody else's home.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hellerstein* X think your colleague

was asked a question* and I want to make sure I understand the
correct situation.
Is it your contention that the warrant that should
have been had here* but was not* should have been a search
warrant* or an arrest warrant?
MR, HXLLXRSTlXN:
QU.ivTIlN:

An arrest warrant,

Should it have expressly authorized arrest

in the home?

I think it need not have.

In other words, supporting papers.

And with that warrant, which needn't say

anything about the home, I assume that at the time he gets the
warrant, or even later, he need not have probable cause to
believe that he is at home.
MR. HJLLJR.iTJIN:
QUJsTIQN:

That is my submission.

MR. But'■..-ji'.fiST.j.IN:

Not so in the Riddick case,

•Mr. Justice Marshall.
There are two other things that X wanted to dispel.
The notion of this burden of time *•- At least in urban areas, ic
is not correct that it takes six hours to get a warrant in New
York County.

We've cited in our reply brief one case where it

was two hours for a search warrant.
Cf course, there is nothing in the record on the time,
but I simply submit that six hours is not an accurate statement.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with respect to rural areas,
X also submit that perhaps the time in obtaining the warrant
might be relevant to an assessment whether the warrant was
required, but I think that would have to depend on the situa*

tion in that rural county.
X also don't know that this Court would hold that
a magistrate, pure magistrate, ought to issue vhe warranc.
Under Chadwick and City of Tampa, it might find something
less.

I don't know.

Mr. Hellerstein, I am both confused and

disturbed now. in view of your ansxvers to some of my colleagues'
questions.
You are contending here that the Constitution requires
an arrest warrant, and then you, as I understood it, say that
if the law enforcement officer is armed with an arrest warrant,
such as you say, in this case the Constitution requires, then
he is authorized to arrest the person wherever he is found.
You said that, didn't you?

MR. HILLLRSTJIN:

I have no idea,

Thousands, aren't there?

MR. HLLLIRSTLIN:

Not arrest warrants.

No. Mr, Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Yes. 1 think you will find that at any given

time in any big city there are thousands of arrest warrants out­
standing. and when a policeman has any doubt they have a system
of checking in to see if there is an outstanding warrant on a
person they have stopped for a traffic accident., or the police­
man may have six outstanding warrants in his pocket for his
particular precinct or district.

They aren't issued with the

view that, necessarily, they are going to be executed within
48 hours,

They have a time limit, by law, but there are a

great many unexecuted warrants floating around in police
departments in this country, state warrants.

warrants which are issued for suspects.

This is probably repeating, but there seems

to rue there has been some misunderstanding*
In this very case., talking about Mr. Payton,-as I
understand the sequence of events, they learned his identity
at one time, his name at another time, his address at another
time.
If at the time before they knew his address, they knew
his identity and had probable cause to believe he was responsible
for the offense, and they got an arrest warrant for that person,
without naming an address, they had then taken that warrant,
later learned his address and broken down the door, as they did
in this case.

If they had the arrest warrant,

yes, but with no address on it,

MR. HJLLSRST JIN:

I would be reluctant to concede that,

Mr, Justice Stevens, because I have had no experience with that
context.

I think that I might go so far as to say that, mainly

because the warrant had been obtained by a magistrate who had
made the determination that there was probable cause,-

And once

that determination was made —

They

They get a warrant to arrest this man;

they know where he lives; they go out and the first place they
look is in his home and nobody answers the door so they break
it down.

You say that's all right.

But it’s not all right if

they don't know his address before they get the warrant?

Is

that your position?
MR, HELLERSTEIN:

No.

I think that in terms of what

the Constitution requires -j

QUESTION:

That's what we are talking about,,

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

— in a warrant, it should have the

man's address in it,
QUESTION:

Well, you are saying then that there is

a constitutional difference, depending on whether they get his
address in the warrant, or not?
MR, HELLERSTEIN:
I am not certain.
QUESTION:

I am not certain of that, though.

I think the key thing -If you take that position, you are really

agreeing with Mr. Justice White, that you want some kind of
constitutional protection on knowing whether he is in the house
or not.

And that would be more like a search warrant.

And then

you are going to say at the time you go in to get the warrant you

would be,j or even the Constitution —
QUESTION:

Well} if your big worry is having the

magistrate’s confirmation as to probable cause that this man

any time, whenever you think there is any time to get them,
and not just for the house.

If the aim of this protection is
