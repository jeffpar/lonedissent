PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in Leo Sheep Company against the United States,
Mrs. Beale.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. SARA S. BEALE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MRS. BEALE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
When Congress made the Railroad Land Grant it re­
served a total of approximately 100 million acres of public
lands that were interspersed checkerboard fashion with the
lands that it had granted to the railroads.

The railroads

received the odd-numbered sections that completely surrounded,
each of the retained public sections.
It was not possible to either enter or leave any of
the retained public sections without passing over soma portion
of the lands that were granted to the railroads.

Th© question

before this Court is whether Congress resarvad a legal? en­
forceable right to eater and leave those 100 million acres of
public lands.
We submit that Congress® intent to reserve a right
of access was manifest in the pattern and in th© plan of the
railroad grants in the same way as the private grantors® in­
tention to reserve a right of access to lands that he retains
when h© makes a grant may be implicit or manifest in the

21
pattern of the grant.
It was settled at common law that where a private
grantor conveys away landsthat completely surround another por­
tion of lands that he retains, he is presumed or assumed to
have reserved some right of access so that he can enter and
leave the lands that he retained in order to make use of them.
QUESTIONs

Of course, a private landowner does not

have the right of eminent domain, does he?
MRS. BEALE!

Wall, that is certainly true and one of

the suggestions that Petitioners have made here is that per­
haps Congress intended to first grant out these 100 million
acres of land and then use the power of eminent domain in order
to secure access to each of these checkerboard sections, one
by one.
And we have suggested in our brief that it is incon­
ceivable that Congress could have purposely intended to set up
a pattern or a mechanism that 'would be that cumbersome and un­
workable.

It would have completely overpowered the state,

territorial and federal courts to have set. up that kind of
mechanism and moreover, we can se© from the history of the use
of these grants that the Federal Government did not turn around
after making the grants and begin a concerted pattern of con­
demnation of these rights-of-way.
We think not only was that anunworkahle way of gain­
ing access to these lands but we find no evidence that that is
what Congress either did intend in the legislative history and

22
no evidence that in fact is what occurred after the land grants
were made so although it is true that Congress does — that the
United States retained a right to use the power of eminent domain when necessary, that that really does not provide the key
to interpreting what Congress* intent was when it made the
checkerboard pattern of land grants,
QUESTION;

Mrs. Beale, 1 suppose it is well-

established that the question of the construction of a federal
grant is a federal question but what foody of law does one turn
to in deciding that federal question?

Is it general, common-

law or real property?
MRS. BEALE;

Well, I think that that may provide

some kind of basis for interpreting what Congress’ intent is.
Of course, the general cases teaching you how to interpret the
act of Congress would look to the legislative intent.

We

would look to the administrative construction and we.y might also
look to the context in which the grants were made, the his­
torical context and we

might also look to th© -- in doing that

we might look to the common law basis for land grants to see
how one might interpret, intent of Congress so X think all of
those would provide a guide.
QUESTION;

Do you see any difference in the common

law between an implied easement and an easement of necessity?
MRS. BEALE:

Well, on® can imply a distinction.

should make our point here.

X

We are not claiming that there was

23
a common law easement of necessity created when Congress made
these grants.

What w© are saying, and this goes back to my

prior answer to you, is that the assumption that underlies the
common law rule about easements of necessity and that also plays
a part in other kinds of implied easements about attempting to
construe the intent of the parties and about what the grantors5
intent must have been in this kind of circumstance is the guide
here so we are not claiming a common law easement by necessity.
What we are seeking to do is to ascertain the intent
of Congress by looking to rules about common law easements by
f

necessity and there are broader rules about easements by impli­
cation so there is some difference.
QUESTION:
not?

You are claiming a reservation, ere you

Not an easement by necessity, because —
MRS. BEALE:

That is exactly right, a reserved ease­

ment and then prior
QUESTION:

It seems to me a grantee with a power of

eminent domain can never show an easement by necessity because
there is no necessity.
MRS. BEALE:

It can always condemn.
Well, one can certainly make that argu­

ment and some of the state courts have certainly suggested that
under state law no easement by necessity can ba —»
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:
QUESTION:

You are claiming a reservation.
That is correct and x^e are using it —
And to follow up my brother Rehnquist's

24
question, are we here in the area of real property law or are
we in the area of central legislative construction?
MRS, BEALE:

Legally, this is primarily a question

of legislative construction but we think in trying to inter­
pret what it was that Congress was doing that not only may
Congress' intent be judged by what its assumptions were about
property law but also that there is an underlying logic to the
common law dealing with easements by necessity which is that
a grantor must have intended to reserve a right to make use of
the property that he retained, that that is manifest in the
pattern of his grant and that is what we really want to point —
QUESTIONS

And it also follows that in the grant to

the railroad was also a grant of an easement over the restained
property of the government, was it not?
MRS, BEALEs

Well, we think not and again, by looking

to the circumstances of —
QUESTIONS

The same circumstances applied.

Each one

is landlocked, so to speak, is it not?
MRS. BEALEs

Well, that is not quite true in the

sense that for many, many years, before the land grants were
made, the Federal Government had developed a well-established
policy of allowing the locations of roadways all across the
public domain.

Nov;, that was not established by statute until

1866 but this Court has clearly in the Alemeda County case,
which we cite in our brief, interpreted that 1866 Act as a

25
recognition of a preexisting right that was barter, then,
really, anything that would be needed to gain access to the
checkerboard land grants, and it is different in kind from
simple right of access back and forth from one checker to
another so we think that the context of the most logical assum­
ption is that Congress knew that it had a policy of allowing
roadways to be located across the public domain, otherwise,
they never could have been settled anywhere and that that pro­
vides one part of the context for this Act but the other part
of the context is that when it left 100 million acres landlocked
in a checkerboard fashion, that it must have intended to have
reserved a legal right to get in and out, ingress and egress
for those sections, not a right dependent upon the fact that
no one would challenge them.
It did not intend that all federal officers, agents
and grantees should be trespassers who could be thrown off»
QUESTION;

Mrs, Beale, to go back to the Alameda

County and the custom that was established, would the roads
established pursuant to that custom, or the trails, survive a
patent of the government's sections to a land owner?
MRS, BEALE;

Yes, the patents were taken

subject to

the roadways that were established and I think that there is a
good, body of case law to -that effect,
QUESTION.;
established?

How about roadways that were not actually

26
MRS. BEALE;
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:

If no roadway had ever been established?
Yes, by the time of the patent.
No, the custom that was established

pursuant or that was recognised in that statute would not have
affected those.

They would be like any other private property

and presumably one would go to another area if the owner at
that point took his land and had built an improvement or what­
ever .
QUESTION:

Since 1362 countless roads have been

constructed through these areas, have they not, by state

and

local government, by the power of eminent domain.
MRS. BEALE:
domain has been used.

Well, certainly the power of eminent
A variety of different methods were

used to locate these roads.
Pursuant to the statute that I just described, the
states followed varying methods.

One of the states at least

and perhaps others passed a statute that dedicated all of the;
section lines as public roads so that as settlers came in,
those ware recognized as public roads.

Other states relied

more upon proscription and in some places counties, territor­
ial governments sat up roads and a variety of methods were
used to locate those roads.
QUESTION:

In any event, in the last 116 years,

many, many new roads have been constructed through these areas.
have they not?

27
MRS. BEALEs
QUESTION:

Yes and ~
Often through the exercise of eminent

domain by state and local governments.
MRS. BEALE:

Is that not true?

Well, first of all, I would like to be

clear on when we are saying "these areas."

I mean, the areas

where the checkerboard grants were located?
*

QUESTION:

Yes, the general areas where we have the

checkerboard system as the result of the 1862 statute.
MRS. BEALE:

Well, and that would include both lands

granted to the railroads —
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALEs

Exactly.
As well as to the public.
Exactly.
And I guess my clearest answer would be

that the record here is not precise as to what was done in
each locality and as to who owned the land when a particular
road was located, either on land granted to -the railroad, land
granted to the United States and to a private party, whether
the land was owned by the Federal Government and the county
decided it needed more than an easement and it decided to lo­
cate a road.
In any event, the

current authority for locating

easements or whatever across federal land is, as we have men­
tioned, the 1976 statute adopted by Congress as part of the
Federal Land policy and Management Act and is a private owner

23
of a railroad, land that, was originally patented to the rail­
road, needed to locate an easement to get in and out of his
checker.
Now, that is not the case here because, of course,the
Leo Sheep Company and Palm Livestock Company have Taylor
Grazing Act permits and they do not require, they do not have
any problem with access but if they did, they could apply to
the Secretary of the Interior and get an easement in and out,
if need be so there is a mechanism and the particular statute
passed in 18S6 is no longer in force but there is a mechanism.
And I would emphasise to the Court that we did not
go into, in great length, the reasons why wa believe that no
reciprocal easement was created across the federal lands, for
one reason because it is so clear that in this particular
case no such easement was required or claimed and indeed, we
think that that was — is, as a general

matter quite true

that the federal statutory provisions, the policies, the new
provisions, are quite adequate and have been quite adaquate to
ensure that the grantees of the railroad have had access and
that that is really not a problem.
QUESTION?

The question arose yesterday as to why

tills basic question had not arisen before in 116 years and it
occurred to me the reason is that it as a practical matter does
not often arise because there are roads through this area.
is access by public roadway.

There

29
MRS. BEALE:Well,, assuming there are not any roadways.
We have cited in our brief some of the early cases which do in
fact recognise the theory that we put forth here, that there is
an implied reservation so that, the grantees of the United States
and the federal agencies and so forth can go in and oat.

It

is another answer to why this was not a problem and we should
emphasize that the right that we claim here is in essence only
going to have important applications in areas like this where
there are not a pattern of roadways already built up.
We claim only the necessary access in and out, ingress
and egress and in developed areas that is simply not a problem.
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:

But not for the government, for the public.
Well, for governmental purposes, which

would include ---•

MRS. BEALE:

Certainly it would include that and

MRS. BEALEs
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:

It is a public roadway, is it not?
Yes, it is.

It is a one-lane —

Not just for federal use.
Well, perhaps it is not in that sense.

It is limited, to the use of federal officers and agents but it
is a —■

MRS„ BEALE:

That is correct but it is a federally-constructed
reservoir and it a federal-use access.

MRS.BEALE:

It is access for the general public.
That is correct.

That is correct.

To this recreational area.
That is correct. It is a one-lane dirt

road —
QUESTION:

Which would ordinarily be served by a

public road.
MRS, BEALE:

That is correct.

In that sense.

So I

would emphasize, as I say, that the right that we claim here
is a narrow one that we find to be implicit in the pattern of
the grant and not a common law easement by necessity and we
think, really, the burden of Petitioner's argument is to estab­
lish that there is another reasonable alternative.
Congress must have intended that there coul1 be use
made of these retained or 100 million acres and the question
is really whether there is any reasonable alternative to the
construction that we have put forth.
I have already suggested 'that we believe the use of
eminent domain to secure a right of access to each of these
sections would have been totally unworkable and moreover, there
is no suggestion — and it is clear from the history that that
method was not used and we think likewise the suggestion that

31
Congress provided only that the settlers should work it out
among themselves, that perhaps state and local laws of eminent
domain would be used, that perhaps people would not object to
the passage of government settlers and so forth is really not
one that can be implied as what Congress intended.
The grants here were made to several large railroad
corporations and -- yes?
QUESTIONs

Mrs. Beale, may I stop you there a minute?

Who would determine the location of these reserved rights-ofway?

Specifically, where would they go and who would decide it?
MRS. BEALEs

Well, wa think the principle that would

be applied here is the general property law principle that
applies to other kinds of easements by implication where there
is no instrument that fixes the location and the general rule
which we think is applicable here is that they must be located
in a matter that provides a minimal intrusion on -the land that
the easement crosses.
We think in many cases, as here, the location would
to® across the corner.

In the first instance there would be an

attempt to reach an agreement between the two partias, the
Government or the Government's grantee and the grantee?

of the

railroad and if that were not possible — which was the case
hare — the Government or its grantee would have a choice of
locating the easement where it was least intrusive so that in
this case it was almost precisely on the corners except in one

32
case there was a gate of some sort, a little down from the
corner and the Government used that.
QUESTION?

Did you say if there were no agreement

that the government would then determine where it should be
located?

Or would you -MRS. BEALEs

Well, assuming that it would be subject

to, you know, judicial proceedings to determine whether the
Government choice was reasonable but in the first instance
the Government would need to try to satisfy the grantor and if
the grantor was not the grantor of the railroad.
The grantor of the railroad would not agree and would
not say where he wanted it and the Government would have to
try to determine what would be reasonable and 1 suppose either
in this case

either of two methods could be used.

In this

case we located it where we felt certain was the least intru­
sive spot and the grantor brought an action against us, the
railroadas grantor.

I suppose we could also, perhaps, bring

a suit to determine a declaratory judgment where it should be
located.
QUESTION:

And this is a permanent road.

The owner

would never have any more use of that corner.
MRSo BEALE:

Well, in this particular case, for

example, it is a dirt road.

I suppose if the owner needed to

have it moved, that might, that might — to make use of his
property there might be some negotiations.

All wa have is the

33
right of access.
QUESTION:

Well, while the Federal Government was

using, the public was using it, he could not use it»
MRS. BEALE:

MRS. BEALE %

QUESTION:

This is more than just an easement.

If,

as we agree, it is for the public use as a publics road, it is

34
more than an easement for just access, ingress or egress over
a piece of property which the fee title owner retains title to,
as suggested by my brother Marshall»

This is a road/ generally»

The title goes to the governmental body that oxms and operates
the road.
MRS. BEALE:

Well/ I am not certain what the most

usual -QUESTION:

Well/ in other words, there could not foe

gracing or anything else on this road if it is a road and if
you are right/ it is more than just an easement of once a day
or once a week the adjacent owner going over it.
MRS. BEALE?

Well, I think it is equally --- in the

case of, let8s go back to our paradigm case of the private
grantor who would perhaps itiake a grant of this same si se piece
of property, two adjacent pieces and need to reserve a right
of access.

In some cases — pardon me?
QUESTION?

5Tou are talking about cross easements of

adjacent land owners.
MRS. BEALE?

Well, if you imagine the doughnut shape

which is always the law book example —
QUESTION?
MRS. BEALE?

Yes.
The grantor reserves the little piece

of the doughnut in the canter and we refer to his having reserved an easement even though it may be necessary in some
\

case to have a dirt road such as this.

He may subdivide that

35
and put — I'm sorry —
QUESTION:

But it is not public property.

The ease­

ment belongs to the fee title owner of the center of the dough­
nut ~
MRS. BEALE;
QUESTION;

The easement belongs to —
— for his use.

It is not for the use of

the public.
MRS. BEALE:

Well, it is for the uses that he can

lawfully ~
QUESTION;
MRS. BEALE;

His use including his visitors.
Wall, that is right and I guess I would

say that our use can include the visitors to our reservoir.
QUESTION;

One more question.

For all practical pur­

poses, insofar as the owner of this land is concerned, if you
succeed here and use this corner of his land, what is the
difference so far as you are concerned in his rights ay taking
it this way or taking it by eminent domain?
MRS. BEALE;

Outside of money?

I think the best answer to that is if

there is a system of public roads later located in this area,
our right of access would no longer be enforceable.

In other

words, if we can get in and out of our lands otherwise, as
soon as an area becomes built up, we no longer have a right —
QUESTION;
MRS. BEALE;

Would you take the road up and move it?
Well, in this case — and perhaps this

is the easiest example of all — all we did was come in and

36
blade off the grass to provide a track to go in and out,
Nov.7, in other cases perhaps it would be necessary
for us to put down gravel or whatever and then take it up if
we no longer needed that for right of access and this goes back
to the point that Mr. Justice Stewart was making also,- the
railroad grantee does retain the title to that land and if our
easement or right of access or way of access in and cut is no
longer necessary for us to use,, then we no longer have a right.
We no longer have an enforceable right and that is an important
difference than what would happen in the case of eminent domain
where we would take full, permanent title to that land.
QUESTION:

Well, that was going to be my question.

Ordinarily, when the Federal Government wants to build a public
road and proceeds to acquire the property by condemnation pro­
ceedings, does it try to acquire just an easement or does it
try to acquire the fee?
MRS. BEALE 3
on this.

Well, Mr'. Marts may have some comment

It is my understanding that very often we acquire

only an easement.

Now, that may not be the case in the case

of an eight-lane super highway.
QUESTION:
MRS. BEALE:

I know.
When the project is so large fee title

is taken but in many cases only an easement is taken and I am
not certain where the dividing line is.
QUESTION:

There may be discretion.

Mrs. Beale, I was going to ask you about

3?
the eight-lane super-highway.

As Justice Stewart has suggested

you can have anything from a footpath to a swimming hole to
perhaps the eight-lane super-highway.
If there is no definition of the reservation 'for
which you argue, would it be permissible under your theory of
the case for the Government to say, what we really need is the
super-highway?
MRS. BEALEs
QUESTIONS
MRS. BEALEs

No, sir.
Why not?
We believe that all that was implicitly

reserved here is the reasonable right of ingress and egress to
make use of these properties.
Now, certainly, the problem is more difficult here
than if the grant had spelled out by the metes and bounds or
whatever what that would entail but there is a whole body of
common law which has developed to meet the problem of trying to
define what is reserved when there

is an implied easement and

we think that that body of law would foe looked to here to de­
termine the extent and in essence what wa are saying is, what
Congress could have reasonably seen as a need to get in and out
to make uses c,f sections would govern.
Certainly what we have here I think is within what
Congress would have intended.

Congress believed that these

sections, as Mr. Marts described yesterday, would in fact—
the retained government sections --- would be subject to

33

homesteading and development.

Congress thought that putting

the railroads out through the west would bring people from the
east and allow them to settle and develop that land.
QUESTION?

Well, then, you v?ould measure reasonable­

ness as of 1862 rather than as of today.
MRS. BEALE?

Is that not right?

Well, only in the sense of what Congress

could have comprehended and Congress did clearly comprehend
development of their sections.

It is something perhaps like

the process that the Court goes through in the case of implied
water reservations where the notion is that at the time the
conveyance or the grant or whatever was made — or the reser­
vation was made, what Congress foresaw as the present and the
foreseeable future needs is the guide and that is the same
guide that is used in the case of the private grantor and we
would say, clearly, the roadway here is within that contempla­
tion.
QUESTIONi

Would your position be the same, assuming

that within two or three years after the transfer to the rail­
road, the government had sold all of sections 16, 22 and. 14 to
a private owner, would that private owner have precisely the
same claim the Government is now asserting?

And then the pri­

vate owner developed the reservoir?
MRS. BEALE %
be any difference.

It is not clear to me why there would

We do think that the right that Congress

reserved was for the benefit of those pieces or parcels of

39
land so that they could be used and in that sense, the benefit
would be conveyed with the parcels of land,

in other words,

it would do no good if we only had the right to use it but as
soon as we conveyed it to the settlers that we expected -QUESTIONS

You do not rely at all on the fact that

it is the United States Government or the sovereign or anything
like that?

It would be —
MRS. BEALE;
QUESTION;

Not in that sense, no.
— precisely the same claim could be made

by an asignee of the Government’s interest.
MRS. BEALE;

Yes and we think that is so prscisely

because of our understanding of what Congress was trying to do
here, which was to grant the odd-numbered sections to the rail­
roads to encourage them to build this rail line keeping these
retained sections, knowing that they would be enhanced in
value, that they would be available for settlement and planning
to sell those off at double the normal price, recouping the
investment that it had made to the railroad and allowing
settlement to progress out west and only by reserving a right
to get in and out and for its grantees and these settlers and
so forth to have an right to get in and out of those sections
could that plan really have been accomplished and that is the
problem, of course, with the Petitioners8 argument. .
Even if Congress had assumed that in many cases no
one would have objected, the plan for the development of the

40

rail lines and the settlement of these sections was dependent
upon a right of these settlers to get in and raake use of this
land that would not be subject to veto power# in essence# by
several large railroad corporations who owned ‘the sections com­
pletely surrounding each one of the retained public sections„

You say the grantees from the railroad had a right

to locate roads over the the reserved public lands.

the public lands had been sold in the meantime?
MRS„ BEALS;

Well, in essence, at some point one gets

back to the same problem that took place under the Homestead
Act and under the other locations, under the Preemption Act and
so forth, which is that some grantee may have wanted to locate
a road across somebody else’s —
QUESTION ;
with this to be sure.

Well, am I correct?

Let me just stick

Am 1 correct in assuming that at least

it was theoretically possible, if all the land was sold, that
the people in the odd-numbered sections would not have the
rights you say the people in the even-numbered sections would
have?
MRS. BEALE;

Yes, if it had all happened in one fell

swoop, suddenly, without any —
QUESTION;
MRS. BEALE;

Is it reasonable that Congress so intended?
Well, we believe not only that it is

reasonable, that the plan shows that and that what has happened
in the intervening years makes that, clear, too.

virtually no instances of the railroad grantee^ who in fact
had the problem that you described.
extensively.

The 1866 Act was used

The Title V provisions are used now and the prob­

lem that we have that we do see occasionally cropping up is
tiie railroads and their grantees blocking access.
One of the answers, of course, to this, is that the
only large block conveyance was to the railroads.

The only

single party who could have blocked access is

in any one

On the understanding they would be finan­

cing and therefore they — they were expected to resell, 1
know they were.
QUESTION:

They had to sell or else they would be

subject to homesteading after three years.
MRS. BEALE: They had to sell or dispose.
QUESTION:
QUESTION ;
MRS. BEALE:

Yes.
Exactly.
Which meant — and there was no require'

merit that the railroad land be sold off to small landowners
and in fact that did not happen in many areas.

The Government

.lands were to be disposed of in essentially 160-acre parcels,
single little parties scattered all over the west»
The only large block grants, the only party who
could have frustrated the development of the whole area was
the railroads who received --QUESTION:

Well, that is true but they were expected

to develop the land and thereby enhance the value of the

43

retained Government lands.
MRS. BEALE:

Well, that is right in the sense that

and it is perhaps maybe a little more complicated than that in
the sense that the Platt case recognized that all the railroads
had to do was to make some use of this land to finance the con­
struction of the railroads within a certain point after the
railroads were constructed.

They were able to and they did in

many cases convey large land holdings to a subsidiary, to a
mortgagor and that party, just as much as the railroad, could
have blocked the development and settlement of Government
sections.
No grantee of the Government would have had that kind
of power.

It was not possible for any single grantee of the

Government in these 160-acre parcels to frustrate the develop­
ment of the land granted to the railroad and it did not happen
and I would emphasize again that we did not develop all of the
reasons in our brief of why we believe that there is no retained
or there was no grant of an easement across the Government lands
because that question is not in the case.
The Petitioners here have the Taylor Grazing Act per­
mits and they use all of our lands where; as Mr. Justice
Blackmun pointed out yesterday, what we want to do is use a
corner of their lands.
I see my time is up, unless you have further questions.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Beale, I do have one further question.

44
Your answers to the questions posed by some of my colleagues
on the opposite side of the Bench indicate that the parties
would be entitled to litigate in Court over the reasonableness
of the easement which the Government designated across the
property»

Does that not undercut to a certain extent your

original argument that Congress could not have intended a
system whereby the Government had to go in and condemn these
by eminent domain because the courts just could not have han­
dled it?
MRS» BEALS %

Well, I guess that I would say, not in

the sense that in most cases, particularly before the Ic-md was
developed to any great extent.

The obvious reasonable place

would be the corner and there would be no point to the private
grantee of the railroad going to court to challenge that.
would get nothing out of it»

He

That would clearly be the least,

intrusive.
QUESTION^
though, is it not?

That is true and eminent domain too,
1 mean, in

many eminent domain cases the

private owner welcomes the Government putting in a road and
simply agrees not to seek any condemnation expenses or value in
exchange for the value to him of the road.
MRS. BEALEs

Well, that may be true and I guess our

point is really that if Congress had thought that no one could
enter these sections except as trespassers until it went out
section by section and determined did it have to brine/

an

45

eminent domain proceeding

and to bring those in cases where

that was necessary,, that would be a substantially more diffi­
cult process that what we suggest happened, which is chat there
was a right to locate upon what appeared to be or to cross to
be at the reasonable and least-intrusive spot and if a

dispute

developed, then the parties %?ould try and work it out»

If not,

the landowner could go to court and say,"Wait a minute, you
should use my gate down here and not go across the corner."

Or

"Wait a minute, I want to locate a house on the corner and you
should go further down" and that is different, if only those
disputed cases are subject to litigation, we would think.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Very well.

t

Mr. Martz, do you have any tiling further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLYDE 0. MARTZ, ESQ.
MR. MARTZs
Courts

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

v
I would like to make a couple of comments and then

see if the Court has any questions of me.
I thought that Counselor's analysis of

the relation­

ship between the odd and even-numbered sections provided an
answer to the question Mr. Justice Blackmun put to me yester­
day which is really, what is at stake in this controversy?
Counselor says that if the successors and interests to
the odd-numbered sections want access across the alternate,

46
even-numbered sections, if still in public ownership, they may
seek a permit from the Secretary of Interior.

There is nothing

in the law that says that permit has to be granted or that it
would be granted free of terras and conditions and restrictions.
If those lands have passed to private ownership by
homesteading, Counselor made it very clear that the homesteader
took a free title without any encumbrance upon it for the bene­
fit of the alternate odd-numbered sections but if the- United
States, either for access to the alternate, even-numbered sec­
tions or for public access to a development such as Seminoe
Reservoir wants to use the private lands of successors and
interests of the railroad, they can take that road without
compensation, determine the si.se of the burden, where the road
will be located with the right in the landowner to either ne­
gotiate or some alternative or to go to court and seek a de­
termination that the easement is excessive.
The landowner may have paid taxes upon the land sub­
ject to the taking of a road for an easement.
I think if the Court would look at United States
against Rindge in the Southern District of California, sited
on page 19 of our brief, we see the burden that is put on the
ranching landowner of the Government exercising these rights
©f driving roadways or highways willy-nilly across ranch lands,
breaking it up into parcels and destroying the utility of the
land now in the hands of purchasers for value based upon clear

47
patents and a clear record title by examination.
If the Government has to go by the condemnat.ion rotate
it will have to pay not just for the small bits of land on
corner crossings but it is going to have to address the impair­
ment of value to the residual lands caused by the opening of
unfeneed public access routes across consolidated ranch areas.
This Court has said many times, as cited on page 24
©f Petitioner's brief, that a construction that alters title
securities should be limited to cases where there is a com­
pelling need and that litigation should be avoided as a conse­
quence of a construction.
Here we have a case whore we have had a uniform ad­
ministrative construction for 116 years now.

It is apparent

that if the Court of Appeals decision is sustained, wo are
going to impose an encumbrance upon some 131,000 acre? that
have been patented under language like Section III in this and
©tlier acts.
It is not illogicaliy that we are also going to cloud
100 million acres of title in these reserved even-numbered
sections and as the Government has pointed out in argument, we
are going to hav® litigation over the sise and burden of these
rights-of-way•
QUESTION s

That might be more complex than the kind

of litigation we traditionally have over a condemnation, would
it not?

48
1'©» MARTZs

Much more so, particularly when the

values that Counselor describes are not significant unless
there is an impairment of beneficial use of the adjoining lands
It would not likely go to condemnation because the values ar©
not significantly enough for that purpose.
QUESTION?

Normally, when the sovereign is going to

condemn land for a road or for any other purpose, the, sovereign
says "It shall be here."
MR. MARTZs
QUESTIONS
MR. MARTS:
QUESTION?
MR. MARTZs
QUESTIONS

Yes.
And then the valuation is determined -Yes, that is right.
— after the fact.
Correct.
Thera is the question, does the court

ordinarily, in a condemnation, get into the question of where
the road shall foe?
MR. MARTZs
QUESTION,?

No, sir, it does not.

The Unitod States

The road is — the passageway is deter­

mined according to need and presumably the engineers take into
account the most economical way to put the road in.
MR. MARTZs

Well, the'United States can taka the .road

any point it thinks is in the best interest of the project and
then damages are computed on the basis of the burden resulting
to the private lands.

Thank you, Your Honor.
