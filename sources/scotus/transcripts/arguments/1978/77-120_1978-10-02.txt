Education against White.
Mr. Viaiters, you may proceed.
OFF: L A RGUMEUT OF JESSE W. WALTERS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF Oi? THE APPELLANTS

MR. WALTERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:'
This case comes to this Court from a three-judge
district court in the Middle District of Georgia and involves

a

,

claim that a certaix what we submit, personnel rule of the

Dougherty County Board of Education was not adopted in con­
formity with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and therefore
was illegally applied to John White, the Plaintiff in the case
below.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was designed, as this
Court knows, to eliminate racial discrimination in voting
which had been practiced principally in some Southern States.
So far as we believe is material to this case before this
Court, Section 5 of that Act provides substantially that
whenever a State or political subdivision shall enact or seek
to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to
voting or standard practice or procedure with respect to
voting different from that in force and effect on November 1,

i».

1964, such change shall not b* utilized or implemented until
either a judicial determination has been secured in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia,that the
change does not have the purpose or effect of denying the
right to vote on account of race, or such change hast been
submitted to the Attorney General of the United States and he
has interposed no objection thereto within 60 days0
We think it material that* as defined- in the Act,
the terra "political subdivision" mean's any county or parish
except that where registration for voting is not conducted
under the supervision of a county or parish;

’She term shall

include any other subdivision of a state which conducts regis­

t

tration for voting.
In May of 1972, John White,' a- twelve-month per year
employee of the Dougherty County Board of Education, made
known to the Board of Education his intention to offer for and
qualify for election to the Georgia House of Representatives»
$he Dougherty County Board of Education had no policy in con­
nection with its employees entering the political arena and'
continuing in that employment.

Rule 58 was therefore adopted

by the Dougherty County Board of Education and it provided
substantially that any employee who became a candidate or
elected for political office would be- required to take a leave>

of absence, without pay, effective upon qualifying for election
to such office, continuing for the duration of the candidacy

5
and during the period of service if elected»
>
QUESTION:

When was this rule adopted, chronologic­

ally, vis-a-vis the Board's becoming aware that Mr. White

)
intended becoming a candidate?
ME» WALTERS:

Mr» Justice Stewart, chronologically,

Mr. White made known his intentions to qualify or to run for
the Georgia House of Representatives.

Thereafter* the Board

of Education adopted Rule 58.
QUESTION:

Immediately thereafter was the rule

adopted?
MR. WALTERS:

Within a very short period of time,

yes, Your Honor.
And after the adoption of the rule, Mr. White then

did, in fact, qualify for election.
QUESTION:

Had they ever had any experience of this

kind before?

MR, .WALTJiRo :

To the knowledge, Mr. Chief Justice,

of the members of the Board at that time, no employee had
ever run for public office, or qualified to run for public
office prior to this time.
This rule was net submitted or. cleared through the

Bistrict Court of tbe District of Columbia or through the
Attorn
\

that it

y arid concisely' because it was- net felt

thought fell within the provi­

sions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Shortly arte::- the adoption of Huis 58* Mr. White
)

qualified for election to the Georgia House of Representatives#
He was granted a leave of absence and was unsuccessful in the

|

Democratic Primary held in August of 1972 and was promptly
thereafter returned to a duty status with pay#
Two years later* Mr. White again qualified for
. election to the Georgia House of Representatives.
was granted a leave of absence without pay.
Mr# White was successful.

He again

This time

He was successful in the Democratic

Primary in August, successful in the general election in
■ November and was returned to a duty status on the 1st of
December 197^.
QUESTION:

Was he on duty status while he was

■serving in the Legislature?
MR. WALTERS:

Mr, Justice Blackmun, I do not

believe anywhere in the record that' this is made explicitly
clear.

I will state for the Court that Mr. White was on a

leave of absence, without pay, during the time that he
actually was serving in the Legislature.

The rule as origin­

ally written provided that he would be granted a leave of
absence without pay during the time to which elected.
election he came before the Board.

After

This is not in the record

J

I hasten to say>

The Board mofified the rule so as to not

to make it effective for the entire two years but just during
the time that he was away in the Legislature.

Mr, White again, in 1976, qualified for reelection
to the Georgia House of Representatives.

He again was granted

a leave of absence on qualification and shortly thereafter
this suit was instituted by Mr, White seeking, among other
things, to'have Rule 58 declared in violation of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, with the view of compelling the Board to
reimburse him for the pay that he had contendedthat he lost
while on leave of absence.
Three-judge court was convened, both parties filed
motions for partially summary judgment and this.three-judge
court, hearing him out cn record and briefs, held that Rule 58
was, in fact, covered by

the Voting Rights Act

Section 5

of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and it is this decision
that brings this case to this Court.
We submit that two questions are submitted to this
Court by the Dougherty County Board of Education.

First,

is the Dougherty County Board of Education a political .'Sub­
division, as defined in the Act, or as established under the
decisions of this Court, so as to be coupled under Section 5
of the Act?
Second, is Rule 58 a voting qualification or
prerequisite to voting or standard practice or procedure with
respect to voting?
It is necessary that both of these questions be
answered in the affirmative in order for the decision of the

District Court to be correct,

-And it. is submitted that the

answer to both is in the negative.
With respect to the first question, a political
subdivision is defined in the Act as any county or parish,
except that where registration for voting is not conducted
under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall
include any other subdivision of a State which conducts
registration for voting.
The Dougherty County Board of Education is not a
county or a parish, nor does it conduct registration for
voting.

And clearly, it does not fit the definition of a

political subdivision as that term is defined in the Act.
Now, admittedly, the Act applies specifically to the
State of Georgia, but this does not mean, we .submit, that it
automatically applies to the Dougherty County Board of
Education, even though that Board is a public body or a
political subdivision, not exclusively that, but it is known
as a political subdivision.
The Dougherty County Board of Education is a
creature or a political subdivision of the State.

It is

charged with the responsibility and duty of operating the
public schools of Dougherty County, nothing more and nothing
less-.
QUESTION:

It is charged with running the schools

under the State and under the laws of the State; am I correct?

9
MR. LA LTLRL:
QUESTION:

Yes, that is absolutely correct,

And pursuant to the laws of the State

and the State Superintendent of Schools'?
MR» WALTERS :

It is certainly charged with the

responsibility under the laws of the State, Mr# Justice
Marshall, but I doubt very seriously that the pronouncements
of the State School Superintendent have the effect of laws
on the Board of Education of Dougherty County, Georgia.
QUESTION:

So, they just run it under the State
r

law ?
MR. WALTERS:

Yes,, sir.

It has —
QUESTION:

Mr. Walters, what about the case in­

volving the City of Sheffield?
MR. WALTERS:

I think I am going to come to that

in just a moment.
QUESTION:

Everything you have said so far applies

equally to that.
MR. WALTERS:

I understand, Mr. Justice Stevens-

and, with your permission, I will
The Dougherty County Board of Education has no
responsibilities or duties in connection with elections,
cannot change the location of a polling place, adopt at-large
systems of elections, provide for the appointment of pre­
viously elected officials.

As a matter of fact, the members

of the Dougherty County Board of Education are appointee!
officials and any change in the method of their selection
must come from the State of Georgia..' '1
The Board cannot enact laws regulating candidacy,
voting procedures, annexations, reapportionment, redistrictlng
or otherwise legislate with respect to any feature of the
electoral

processes.
Congress did not intend for the Voting Rights Act

to apply to a political subdivision that had absolutely no
function relating to voting in elections.

Kvery decision

that I have been able to find involving the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 involves a political entity that has powers and
responsibilities with respect to the election processes.
There must be this, we say and submit to this Court, for the
Voting Rights Act to apply to a political subdivision.

And

this must be real responsibility, real duty, real power, not
isnaginery or fanciful.
Now, the case of the United States

y. Board of

Commissioners of Sheffield, Alabama, does in fact hold that
a political subdivision does not have to register voters to
become a covered political subdivision, under Section 5»
We submit, though, that it is essential to the
understanding of Sheffield' to look at its factual situation.
The City of Sheffield, Alabama, on November 1, 196A? was
governed by three commissioners elected by the city at large.

:u
‘5 ornet ime during the year 1975* Sheffield determined
to submit a referendum to the people of the city to see if
they desired to change the form of government to a mayorcouncil form, consisting of a mayor and eight councilman,
the eight councilmen elected at-large.
Mow, bear in mind here that the City of Sheffield
had the complete responsibility, the complete power in con*

nection with this election, even though they did not register
voters„
The referendum ’was submitted, was passed and the
City of Sheffield called an election to implement the new
form of government and to elect the new officials.

The United

States filed suit contending that this was a change that should
have been either cleared through the District Court of the
District of Columbia or the Attorney•General of the United
States and asking an injunction.

The three-judge court dis­

missed the proceeding, finding unanimously that the City of
Sheffield was not a political subdivision as defined in the
Act o
