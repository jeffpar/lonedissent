MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Miss Smith# you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT 0? BARBARA A. H. SMITH# ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MISS SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
I am Barbara A. H. Smith.
General.

I am Assistant Attorney

I represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts# the

Petitioner in this matter.
The Commonwealth seeks review of a decision of the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts which interpreted this
Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona as requiring# per se#
automatic exclusion of statements obtained in violation of the
Miranda prophylactic safeguards for the purpose of establishing
probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.
Specifically# the court held that it was error for the
trial judge to have denied the Defendant Charles White's motion
to suppress certain physical evidence which had been seized
pursuant to a search warrant.

The affadavit in support of

which search warrant was based upon statements which the trial
court had held should be suppressed at trial because they were
obtained in violation of the waiver requirement of Miranda v.
Arizona.

The Supreme Judicial Court# therefore# reversed the

4
defendant’s conviction on four indictments* charging possession
of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.
It is the Commonwealth's belief that the facts and
the circumstances surrounding the taking of the statements at
issue are of crucial relevance to the application of the exclu­
sionary rule* and therefore I will devote myself to explication
of those facts with some particularity.
In the motion to suppress* both the arresting officer and
the state trooper who received the statement* testified.

The

arresting officer testified that at 2:00 a,m, on March 28* 1975*
he was informed of a motor vehicle accident.

He proceeded to

the scene of the accident and observed that a car had been
driven over an embankment* knocking down several highway posts.
He observed the Defendant Charles White in the car at the bottom
of the embankment* attempting to drive it back up.
asked the police officer for a push.

The Defendant

The officer determined

that that was not going to work and at the same time noticed
that the Defendant’s speech was slurred* his eyes were glassy
and he noticed a strong odor of alcohol.

At this time* the police

officer instructed the Defendant to turn off the motor of the
car* to get out and he instructed him that he was placing him
under arrest for driving under the influence of liquor and he
advised him of his rights under Miranda.
The Defendant* at this point* expressed soma concern
that the dome light of his car would not turn off and he was

5
afraid his battery would run down.
accompany the police officer.

However, he agreed to

They then walked up the embank­

ment and there was testimony from the police officer that the
Defendant did stagger, but he walked up the embankment unassisted.
They were then met by the state police trooper who agreed to
have the car towed to the state police barracks and to go for­
ward and arrange for a breathalyzer test.
When the Defendant and the arresting officer arrived
at the state police barracks, the state trooper again advised
the Defendant of his rights under Miranda.

He advised him of

the right to remain silent, a right to have an. attorney present,
that anything he said would be used against him, and he had a
right to have an attorney appointed.

He further advised him,

under Massachusetts law, of his right to take or refuse a
breathalyzer test and of the consequences of refusal in
Massachusetts would be a 90-day suspension of license.

He

further advised the Defendant of his statutory right to make
a telephone call and to have a blood test conducted at his own
expense by his own physician.
The Defendant responded as to the breathalyzer test
that he felt he would lose his license either way, so he might
as well take it.

He also indicated that he wanted to make some

phone calls.
In the course of warning up the breathalyzer machine,
the Defendant placed at least two phone calls, both of which

6
were, apparently# In an attempt to secure the services of an
attorney and to arrange for bail*

Parts of these telephone

conversations were overheard by both officers*

However# he

apparently was unsuccessful in obtaining the services of an
attorney at 2;00 o'clock in the morning*

Also# there was

testimony that in attempting to use the pay telephone the
Defendant dropped coins on the floor and had difficulty in
picking them up*
A breathalyzer test was administered and the percentage#
by weight, of alcohol found in the Defendant's bloodstream was
thirteen one hundredths*

Under Massachusetts Law# anything

over *10 raises a statutory rebuttable presumption that one is
under the influence of alcohol# for the purpose of driving a
motor vehicle*
The state police trooper described the Defendant
during the taking of the breathalyzer test and making the phone
calls as being# in his opinion# under the influence of alcohol#
that he was bouncing around# that he was scratching incessantly
and that he was dropping coins,

However# he also testified

that he had no trouble conversing with the Defendant# the
Defendant indicated he understood his rights when given and
that there was no interrogation of the Defendant*

However#

prior to placing the Defendant in a cell# having completed all
the prearraignment procedures# the trooper searched him and
found a marijuana cigarette in the breast pocket of his shirt*

7
He at that time felt it was a new ball game and advised the
Defendant he would be charged with possession of marijuana and
again advised him of his rights under Miranda „
The Defendant responded —
QUESTION:

Wasn't there some response on the Defen­

dant's part at that time?
MISS SMITH:
yes* Your Honor.

At this particular — At this moment*

The Defendant said something to the effect*

"I don't think possession of a single cigarette is a crime.”
And the trooper responded* 'Veil* do you have any more on your
person or in your car?"

And the Defendant responded* "Yes* I

have more in my vehicle."
Then the Defendant attempted to say* "I can name you
some biggies," apparently in reference to some narcotic dealers
and the state police trooper said* "I don't want to hear any­
thing more*" and placed the Defendant in a holding cell.
He then prepared an affidavit and an application for
a search warrant* relating the arrest of the Defendant and his
response to the question about the marijuana cigarette.
QUESTION:

In Massachusetts*would he have been able

to get a warrant without reciting the statement made that there
was more material in the car* that is* on simply showing that
the man was found In a dubious condition of — disoriented
condition and that he had a marijuana cigarette on his person?
Would that be enough to support a warrant for the search of the

8
car?
MISS SMITH:
have,

No* Your Honor* I don't believe it would

In fact* In this case* the Supreme Judicial Court and the

trial judge himself found that the validity of the warrant was
based on the statement that there was more* that there would
not have been enough without it.
QUESTION:

That8® not quite my question.

Is there

no search and inventory made of the car when it is taken into
possession out in the woods and brought into the pound,
MISS SMITH: Yes* Your Honor* under ordinary course
there is provision for inventory,

Unfortunately* the record

in this case was never established that there was an inventory
procedure at this particular state police barracks.

There was

no evidence introduced on the motion to suppress as to an in­
ventory,and I really don't feel that I could make that argument
on the basis of this record.

But there are cases that would

substantiate an .inventory search* that when a car is brought in
and In the process of being impounded —
QUESTION:
— and I say if

If an inventory search would be supportable
then how relevant is the warrant in all the

other issues?

Our court found that quite relevant

:

I am thinking now about what you
Do you or do you not argue that

9
since an inventory search would have been permitted without a
warrant* that it doesn't make any difference whether this
warrant was or was not supported.
MISS SMITH:

Do you make that argument?

I have not made that argument* because

I don't think the record clearly supports that argument.

If

there had been evidence that an Inventory was the normal course
of procedure* then I would make that argument.

But I think the

fact that the search warrant was invalid would not litigate
against the validity of the inventory search.
QUESTION:

I thought you indicated that the inventory

search was the usual procedure* but the record doesn't show it
was followed here.
MISS SMITH:

It was never established it was the

usual procedure in the state police barracks that we are dealing
with in this case.

There was nothing in the record concerning

an inventory search.
QUESTION:

Isn't it true that the Commonwealth did

make the inventory search argument in the Supreme Judicial
Court and the Supreme Judicial Court rejected the argument
straight on.

And then in your questions that you present in

your cert petition* you did not raise that issue.

So it Is

not before us.
MISS SMITH:
correct.

Right* Your Honor.

That's absolutely

Then the Supreme Judicial Court didn't rule on -•» or

they rejected it because there was no evidence.

10

QUESTION:

Yes* but they ruled squarely on a contention

that the search could be justified on an inventory theory* and
you lost on that theory in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court o
MISS SMITH:

Yes* Your Honor.

Following the motion to suppress* the trial judge
ruled that the Commonwealth could not sustain* or had not sus­
tained its heavy burden of demonstrating that the Defendant had
knowingly and intelligently waived his right to self"incrimina­
tion* his right to counsel.
They base this conclusion on three findings:

One*

that the Defendant had demonstrated a desire for counsel and
that he had placed two unsuccessful telephone calls to an
attorney* that the trooper did not regard the Defendant as having
waived his right to counsel and that the Defendant was under
the influence* having blown a point one three reading on the
breathalyzer test.
However* the Court refused to suppress the evidence
seized pursuant to the search warrant.

He did not believe that

suppression was required under the "Fruit of the Poisonous
Tree" doctrine.

He noted that Miranda did not preclude use for

all purposes of evidence taken in violation of one of its safe­
guards* and that there would be no deterrent effect of applying
the exclusionary rule in this instance where the police had been
scrupulous in their efforts to obey Miranda and that there was

11

absolutely no actual coercion involved»
The Supreme Judicial Court reversed, treating the
Miranda violation as a violation of constitutional guarantees.
The Gourfc held that statements, therefore, could not be used
for the purpose of establishing probable cause for the issuance
of a search warrant.

For to do so, reasoned the court, would

imply judicial sanction of the initial violation®
The Commonwealth submits that the court below, in
reaching this conclusion, has read much too broadly the exclu­
sionary requirements of Miranda, that there is no consitutional
requirement mandating exelusion of statements received In viola­
tion of Miranda for all purposes, and that the "Fruit of the
Poisonous Tree" doctrine is not applicable in this case where
there is no initial constitutional violation and the application
of that rule would have no deterrent effect.
The court below, we submit, has incorrectly and in­
consistently with this Court's more recent cases, equated a
violation of Miranda procedural safeguards with a violation
of protected constitutional rights.
The court below has interpreted Miranda as requiring,
per se, automatic exclusion of statements taken in violation of
its prophylactic safeguards for all purposes.

Such a position

is not required by the Constitution, we submit, and is incon­
sistent with the recent decisions of this Court.
First, Miranda, itself was limited to the admissibility

12
of statements in the prosecution’s case in chief.

Recent

decisions have continued to apply this prohibition, that is,
that statements taken may not be admitted in the case in chief.
However, they have permitted use of the statements for collateral
purposes, specifically, in Harris v. New York and in Oregon v.
Hass.

Statements may be used to impeach credibility if they

are otherwise trustworthy,
In Michigan v0 Mosely, the Court went one step further
in rejecting any literal interpretation of Miranda which would
view any statement taken after a suspect Invokes his right to
remain silent as a product of compulsion to be mandatorially
excluded, even if the statement is made voluntarily.

Rather

than the mandatory exclusion, the admission of the statement,
I submit, depends on an examination of whether a defendant's
right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored.
Finally, in Michigan v. Tucker, this Court, holding
that the testimony of a witness discovered as a result of a
defendant's statement which had been taken in violation of
Miranda was admissible in the prosecution's case in chief,
specifically distinguished between police conduct which directly
infringed on a right against compulsory self“incrimination and
conduct which violated only the prophylactic rules.
Commonwealth suggests that certain conclusions may
be Inferred from these decisions, one, that the Miranda guide­
lines are not independent constitutional requirements, two,

13
that all police interrogation is not so necessarily inherently
coercive as to implicate the Fifth Amendment, and third, that
statements taken in violation of Miranda are not automatically
excludable for all purposes, provided they are otherwise trust"
worthy.

Therefore, the question becomes —
QUESTION:

While it is certainly true that not all

police interrogation is inherently coercive, wasn't the thesis
of the Miranda opinion that police interrogation of a person in
the custody of the police ~ in custody and restraint — was
inevitably Inherently coercive?
MISS SMITH:

I believe that was the premise of the

Miranda decision, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Was it the premise of the whole judgment

and opinion?
MISS SMITH:

Indeed, I think it was.

However, I do

believe and my citation of some of the recent cases indicates
to me that this Court has withdrawn from that presumption,
because otherwise if we are to assume that all police inter­
rogation is necessarily inherently coercive in that it involves
the Fifth Amendment «»
QUESTION:

Not all police interrogation, but all

police interrogation of a person in the custody of the police.
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, in custody interrogation

is necessarily and inherently coercive as to implicate the Fifth
Amendment, then I would say it would be inconsistent for the

14

Court to hold that those statements may be admissible for certain
purposes if they are otherwise trustworthy.
Traditionally# if a statement is elicited in violation
of the Fifth Amendment# in the sense that it is involuntary#
we don’t go any further*

It is inadmissible.

We don't even

get to the trustworthiness of the statement.
QUESTION:

The Miranda opinion# itself# which# of

course# covered five different cases# as you know# conceded that
some of the statements in at least some of those cases were not
involuntary statements in the traditional meaning of that word.
Isn't that correct?
MISS SMITH:

That's correct# Your Honor# but it seems

to me that the recent cases in this Court interpreting Miranda
and the scope of the exclusionary rule in Miranda have Indicated
a willingness to examine the circumstances and distinguish
between police conduct which actually abridges a right# where
there is actual coercion# psychological or physical# where
there are threats# inducements# cajolery# promises# to actually
examine the circumstances.

And it seams to me to reject a

per so assumption that there is a sufficient coercive power at
work because of custodial interrogation to render a statement
inadmissible because it is in violation of the Fifth Amendment
right against compelled testimony.
QUESTION:

Well# the statement is admissible if a

person is given his so-called Miranda warnings.

It is

15

admissible, it is not inadmissible,
MISS SMITH:

But it has also been held admissible for

certain purposes,
QUESTION:

If it is involuntary, it is inadmissible

for any purpose,
MISS SMITH:

That’s correct, but the fact it is a

violation of Miranda —
QUESTION:

It is admissible if the Miranda warnings

were given.
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Your point, I take it, is that the recent

>

Miranda cases from this Court would not have come out the same
way if we had been dealing with confessions that were found to
be coerced, but- nonetheless trustworthy.
MISS SMITH:

In one sense, Your Honor.

What I am

saying is the recent decisions wouldn’t come out the way they
have which admitted statements for some purposes which had been
:

taken in violation of Miranda because of a lack of a warning
in some instance or the lack of a waiver.
QUESTION:

You say that if those statements, instead

of having been taken in some violation of Miranda, had been
found to be coerced, the inquiry, would have stopped there.
MISS SMITH:

That's right, and they would not be

admissible for any purpose, if they were coerced.

But the

simple fact that they were taken in violation of Miranda did

16
not lead this Court to a conclusion that they were coerced without something more.
QUESTION:

But the corollary of that, if they were

given voluntari3.y after Miranda warnings, they are admissible.
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And if the Court should conclude that, It

would not have to decide any other issues in the case, is that
correct?
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Are you contending there was not a violation

of the Miranda ~~
MISS SMITH:

The court ruled there was a violation of

the waiver requirement,
QUESTION:

Do you challenge that, or are you arguing

that even if there was the evidence should be admissible?
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes. Your Honor.
I know you are arguing that, but are you

also arguing the threshold question?

Are you attacking the

finding that that there was a violation?
MISS SMITH:

I don't think that the finding was

constitutionally required, Your Honor.

You are absolutely

correct. That there was a lack of knowing and intelligent
waiver on his part,
QUESTION:

So you concede there was, as Miranda has

stated, that there was a violation of the Miranda rules here.

17

MISS SMITH:

Oh., yes, Your Honor.

There Is a violation

of the waiver provision which requires
QUESTION:

That was because of his indication that

he wanted a lawyer?
MISS SMITH:

That was on two bases, the Indication

that he wanted a lawyer and the fact that he was under the
influence of alcohol.

It was not on the basis, nor did the

state court find, although my colleague has suggested,that the
statement was Involuntary^

Now, neither the state court

findings of fact would support a finding of Involuntariness
nor did the Supreme Judicial Court make any further findings
which would support a finding of involunfcariness.
QUESTION:

What would be your position with respect

to an arrested criminal defendant who was under the influence
of alcohol who proceeded to recite a full confession of the
act, which amounted to the commission of a crime?

Would you

feel that was inadmissible?
MISS SMITH:

No, Your Honor, I would not.

I think

the fact that he was under the influence is a factor to be
considered, but mere being under the influence of alcohol is
not a determinant factor in deciding whether a statement is
voluntarily made.
QUESTION:

Do you mean it would be a factor to be

taken into account on the voluntariness?
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it should be a

18

factor.
QUESTION:

15ve often thought* at least* that alcohol

tends to loosen tongues* but you don’t think there is anything
unconstitutional about a loose-tongued alcoholic confession?
MISS SMITH:

No* Your Honor* I don't.

And I also

would like to make the distinction in Massachusetts between
being under the Influence for the purposes of driving an auto­
mobile and being intoxicated.
evidence of Intoxication.

In this case* we don't have any

We have evidence only of being under

the influence and having certain motor responses affected*
spatial responses affected.

But it is not* say* a Townsend v.

Sain situation where a defendant has been injected with a truth
serum which clearly is going to operate on the faculty by which
he determines ivhether or not to make a statement.
QUESTION:

Miss Smith* in addition to the violation

of Miranda * which you say relies on both evidence that approaches
intoxication and the fact that he tried to contact his lawyer*
what about just the second factor* the lawyer point?

Was there

a violation of his right to counsel?
MISS SMITH:

No* Your Honor* I would say not.

In

this Instance he never — or there is no evidence that he ever
advised the police officer that he wanted an attorney present
before there was any interrogation.
QUESTION:

But I think you Indicated that they over-

heard his conversation and knew he was seeking the assistance

19

of a lawyer and was dropping coins all over fche floor,,
MISS SMITH;

Yes* and that would appear to be for

the purposes of making bail.

Since there was no interrogation

conducted at all in relation to the original charge of driving
under the influence* I don’t see why the police should have
suspected that he wanted an attorney present at a nonexistent
interrogation.
QUESTION:

Do you think the case would be different

if he had said* unambiguously, "I'd rather not talk to you
until I consult my lawyer"?
MISS SMITH;

Yes* I do believe that that would make

a difference* Your Honor.
make a phone call.

Here he only indicated he wanted to

He never indicated --

QUESTION:

If you think that would make a difference

-- and I don’t think either the trial court or the Supreme
Court made a determination of whether there had been an attempt
to contact counsel* kind of an Escab Ido type point — is it
conceivable that the proper disposition of the case would be

J

to send it back to determine whether his telephone call was the
i \

equivalent?

I suppose one could argue it was substantially the
i

equivalent of an attempt to ask for counsel.
MISS SMITH;

(

I don’t believe that the record would

support that* Your Honor.

And the Escabldo situation* I would

suggest* is entirely different from fche situation here.

There

counsel was present at the police station* fche defendant requested

20
to speak with his counsel, the counsel requested to speak with
him and the police affirmatively denied those requests.

Here,

the police officer never cut off his ability to make the phone
calls.

He made no attempt to interrogate him and, in fact, the

only question — if you can call that an interrogation — came
on a separate charge, after a new set of warnings had been given,
and was in response to a conversation initiated by the defendant,
himselfo
QUESTION:

The thing that puzzles me about this case

is why the officer, when the man mentioned he had some infor­
mation about "biggie," why the officer didn't say tell me about
him.

I just don't understand it, why he wouldn't be interested

in knowing about him.
MISS SMITH:

He may have been interested but he may

have felt that any interrogation of the Defendant at that time
would be improper,,
QUESTION:

Why, I wonder?

QUESTION:

Because the Defendant was drunk, isn't that

why?
MISS SMITH:
drunk.

No, Your Honor, the Defendant was not

The Defendant registered a point one three on the *

breathalyzer, which would show that he is under the Influence,
but not intoxicated.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, the policeman, appar­

ently accurately, predicted the later decisions of courts of

21
your state.
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, I think the police

officer was attempting throughout, in the number of warning®
given and his whole demeanor to follow the dictates of this
Court and the courts of Massachusetts.
QUESTION:

However., if I may --

Let me pursue it with just one more

question, if I may.

Is it not correct that if your view of

the law is followed by this Court, in a future identical situ­
ation the officer would be well advised to pursue the inter­
rogation and find out about the "biggie”?
MISS SMITH:
advised to do that.

No, I don't think he would be well
Why take the chance, Your Honor?

He

would get right back in the situation where we are here.
QUESTION:

He would not be able to use the statement

against the man, himself, but he would be able to use the
information for further investigative purposes and it might
lead to the discovery of other evidence which would be entirely
admissible.
'v

MISS SMITH:

Your Honor, there, I think, we ought to

again look at the circumstances.

Here we had an unintentional

violation and I think that is important in determining whether
the evidence subsequently obtained is actually tainted by the
Miranda violation.

Now, if we had a situation where the police

are going to violate Miranda rules, in the hope that they are
going to elicit some evidence that may be used in some other way,

22
then I don't think that conduct is going to be found to be
permissible* because there we had intentional conduct -QUESTION:

They ought to follow up on these leads and get the evidence.
I don't see anything wrong with it* under your theory as I
understand it* because his constitutional rights are not
violated unless his own statement is used at his trial against
him,
MISS SMITH:

Unless there is some element of coercion

or trickery.
QUESTION:

I don't understand.

You are not taking

the broad position* or are you *»- I am a little puzzled “■» that

23

any derivative evidence may be used in the trial, other than
the statement itself, as long as it is not coercive in a con-»
stifcutional sense.
MISS SMITH:

Yes, I am taking that position, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, then if you are, you should say they

could ask him about the "higgles," then.
MISS SMITH:

Possibly, they could ask him about the

"biggies," as long as we don't get into a situation where th©
police actually are abusive or coercive in a sense that the
statement is derived in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.
QUESTION:

But that wouldn't violate his Fifth

Amendment rights.
MISS SMITH:

In that sense, though, then I would argue

that the derivative evidence could be used and the "Fruit of
the Poisonous Tree" doctrine would not apply.
QUESTION:

You do agree then that in the future if

you win this case they ought to be able to ask about the
"biggies."
MISS SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

May I reserve — I think I have a few moments.

24
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT Se COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Robert S. Cohen, and I represent the
Respondent Charles F. White.
Respondent contends that the decision of the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts lacks finality and is not a
final judgment under 28 U.S.C. 1 1257(3).

Additionally,

Respondent submits that because the decision of the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court is unclear as to whether it is based on
the Massachusetts Constitution or on the Constitution of the
United States, that this Honorable Court should either remand
the case back to the Supreme Judicial Court for clarification
of its decision or, If it decides not to do that and not remand
the case back to the court, should dismiss the writ of certiorari
as being improvidently granted.
As concerns the merits of the case, Respondent con~
tends that the Supreme Judicial Court was correct in ordering
suppression of a contraband and money obtained under a search
warrant which was based on information secured in violation of
consfcitutS.onal guarantees.
QUESTION:

Your fourth choice then Is to affirm the

Supreme Judicial Court?
MR. COHEN:

My third choice, Your Honor.

I would

25
suggest that it either be remanded or that the writ be dismissed
as improvidently granted* or that the case be affirmed.
Addressing the jurisdictional questions first*
Respondent contends that since he is subject to further pro­

trial* that the Supreme Judicial Court's decision is not final.
It is submitted that the denial of certiorari for lack of a
final judgment in Cohen v > New York* 385 U„S. 976* demonstrates
that there is no unvarying rule that all decisions of a state's
highest court concerning a motion to suppress evidence are
final for purposes of jurisdiction under (Section 1257(3).
Turning to the issue of independent state grounds*
Respondent contends that the decision of the Supreme Judicial
Court is unclear as to whether it is based on the Massachusetts
Constitution or the Federal Constitution.
QUESTION:

Why did the Supreme Judicial Court of

Massachusetts not only cite Miranda* but quote from it?
MR. COHEN:

I think* Your Honor* that is still unclear

because in addition to* besides citing,,—

courts* they said that they relied on both and tta t the latter —

In other

cases, they have remanded the case back for clarification.
QUESTION:

You mean this Court dismissed as improvi­

denfcly granted cases before 1920?
MR. COHEN:

I am sorry, Your Honor.

I didn't hear

the question.
QUESTION:

When did this Court start the dismissing?

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

If you did, then I am sorry.

MR0 COHEN:

I apologize for not expressing myself

QUESTION:

The point is if it is not clear whether

or not the state court relied upon an adequate and Independent
state ground, then it is encumbent upon this Court to remand it
to determine whether or not it did.

But if it is clear that the

judgment rests upon an adequate and independent state ground,
then this Court simply has no jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

There is nothing Inconsistent between that.

MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

I agree, Your Honor.
And if it is clear, from the opinion, that

it rested both on the Massachusetts Constitution and the Federal
Constitution, then it does rest on an adequate state ground
and must be dismissed.
MR. COHEN:

Must be dismissed, Your Honor.

29
QUESTION:

The Supreme Judicial Court was quite well

aware in its footnote citing Opperman that it had available to
it the Massachusetts Constitution and didn't have to dec.!de
whether there was a state-federal question there,, was it not?
MR. COHEN:

I believe so, Your Honor, but this case,

in my opinion, does not present an Opperman on inventory situ­
ation.

It only presents a situation of the us® of illegally

obtained statements.
QUESTION:

All I am saying is that why, when it was

so clearly aware that it could rest the decision either on a
federal or state constitution. In the Opperman footnote, did
it lean so heavily on Miranda here?
MR. COHEN:

I don't think that they did lean so

heavily on Miranda, Your Honor.

I think they leaned heavily on

the two prior stated Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
cases.

Indeed, Your Honor please, the court stated that "from

these cases it follows," making reference to two Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court cases.

"From these cases it follows that

neither may such statements" —
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Where are you reading from?
I am reading. Your Honor, please,

Appendix 78, the third complete paragraph.

at the bottom.

The need to prevent such violations from

United States and Nardone v. United States.

in this Commonwealth."
And I am saying that when the -QUESTION:

Wasn't Haas decided on the basis of the

Federal Constitution?
MR. COHEN:

No, Your Honor, a look at Haas and Hall,

the two cases cited by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court*
in both Haas and Hall, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
relied on both Massachusetts State cases, on Commonwealth v.
Penfca and on Miranda.
QUESTION:

They may have relied on sot.® previous

Massachusetts cases, but what did those cases rely on?
COHEN:

I just made a

The two cases they relied on were

Commonwealth v. Hall and Commonwealth v. Haas.

Those two cases

relied on Massachusetts State cases, CommonweaIth-Ha11 —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but what did those

31

cases, in turn, rely on?

Were those interpretations of the

Federal Constitution?
MRa COHEN:

They were interpretations of Constitutional

rights, Your Honor*
QUESTION: Which Federal Constitutional rights?
MRs COHEN:
search and seizure.
QUESTION:
MR, COHEN:

Well, the GommonweaIth-Ha 11, that was
That was a Fourth Amendment case,
It did deal with the Federal Constitution?
Well, it is unclear, again, from those

decisions what constitutional rights they were talking about,
QUESTION:
MR, COHEN:

You just said a Fourth Amendment issue,
I agree with you, but certainly the

Federal Fourth Amendment issue was involved.

And I would say

to you, Your Honor, I don't know if counsel argued or if the
motion to suppress in that case alleged state grounds.

The

motion to suppress in this case alleged state grounds, along
with federal grounds.
QUESTION:

It may be, but just because the Court here

cited some previous Massachusetts cases doesn't indicate tome
that there was a state ground involved.
MR. COHEN: I would say. Your Honor, that further
evidence -QUESTION:

Those cases might just have been inter­

pretations of the Federal Constitution.
MR, COHEN:

I would say that further evidence of a

32

state grounds* Your Honor* is that this is not a case where the
Supreme Judicial Court has reluctantly applied Federal consti­
tutional standards.

This is a case where the Supreme Judicial

Court suppressed the evidence.
QUESTION:

I'll ask you this.

There is no mention

of the State Constitution in this opinion?
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

That's correct* Your Honor.
Was there any mention of the State

Constitution in the two state cases that this opinion cited?
MR. COHEN:

There is no direct mention of it made*

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well* was there any direct mention of the

State Constitution in any of the state cases that these two
cases cited?
MR. COHEN:

No* Your Honor* please* but I would say*

Your Honor* that that particular fact does not* in Itself* say
that the case is not ambiguous.

The cases seem to indicate that

if the thing was cited directly then it would be clear.
would be no problem.

There

Here* the Respondent is arguing that it

is unclear, and that because of it being unclear* consistent
with the respect due the highest courts of States of the Union*
as Justice Jackson said* then the Supreme Judicial Court should
be asked and not be told.
QUESTION:

Am I right* Mr. Cohen?

I have been reading

some recent opinions of your Supreme Judicial Court and I have

33
been interested that it has often — these opinions often wind
up "and we are resting this decision on our State Constitution
and not on the Constitutionrof the United States."

Is this a

new practice of your court?
MR* COHEN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that they are

just attempting now to be more clear, because of the fact that
the Supreme Court of the United States may differ with them,
as certain policy issues»

Indeed, the case that I submitted to

the Court after the filing of my brief, Selectmen of Framingham
V» the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, was a case where
0

this Court declined to apply United States v, Janls and said
that in order to uphold public confidence in the law and judicial
integrity and to control misconduct of the police, they would
not allow into a Civil Service hearing evidence that was de­
rived in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

But there they did say -- I think that's

the one I am thinking of — that they are resting it squarely
on their Constitution, because they did not agree with our
interpretation.
MR. COHEN:

If that case was up here, It is clear.

I am saying that this case is not clear. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, what you are saying, at most, then,

is that this ought to be clipped, sent back for reconsideration
and tell us whether or not they rested on a state constitutional
ground as well as the federal.

34
MR* COHEN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct* Your Honor*
Mr* Cohen* I think there is another

problem with your argument here*

The Massachusetts law* as I

understand it* taking it most favorably to you* is that If there
is a constitutional violation then the derivative use of the
evidence obtained by means of the constitutional violation cannot
be used to get a search warrant*
MR* COHEN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor*
However, yo.ur opponent challenges the

existence of the constitutional violation*

His argument is

that Miranda, properly construed, does not Involve a consti­
tutional violation*

And, as to that point, the Massachusetts

Supreme Court relied only on federal law, I think*
MR* COHEN:

You are making reference to the waiver,

Turning to the merits of the case at bar* Respondent
respectfully suggests five interrelated arguments in support
of his contention that the unanimous decision of the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts should be affirmed.
Number one* the questioning of the Respondent* absent
a valid waiver* and under the circumstances of the case at bar*
violated both Miranda v. Arizona and the Fifth Amendment.

37
Number two, that the evidence obtained pursuant to
the execution of the search warrant* in this case* must be
suppressed* because its admission would violate Miranda* the
Fifth Amendment* and the policy under the "food of the poisonous
tree" doctrine.
QUESTION:

Is the testimony — Your argument then is

that by having this statement used as a basis for getting the
warrant* that’s testimony being used against him?
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor.
What if the search had produced nothing?

Then would the statement be a statement of his own which is
used against him in violation of the Fifth Amendment?
MR. COHEN:

Well* the statement would not be able

to be used in court* Your Honor* and I am saying that besides
the statement not being able to be used in court* the results
of the search warrant should not be able to be used in court*

MR» COHEN;

Esc abito was cited with approval in Brewer v. Williams.,

I would

say that a combination of Brevier v« Williams and Escablto
results in a determination that the introduction of this
evidence would violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel»
Respondent’s fourth argument* besides the violation of
Miranda and Fifth Amendment and the right to counsel is that
under the standards enunciated by this Court in United States
v» Giordano* 416 U,S, 505* both the majority and the dissenting
opinions* that the evidence should be suppressed.

In Giordano

the majority of this Court said that a pen register application
was based on illegally monitored evidence and* therefore* the
results obtained from the pen-registercmust be suppressed»
Mr» Justice Powell* in dissenting* in part* said*
"The standard should not be a critical element*" as the majority
indicated* "but the standard should be whether absent the il­
legally obtained information the application for the search
warrant was Sufficient to establish probable cause»"
In the case at bar* the Supreme Judicial Court and,,
the Superior Court judge found that unquestionably the appli­
cation for the search warrant looked at without the illegally
obtained information* v?as not sufficient to rise to the level
of probable cause.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. COHEN (Resumed)
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
I will continue to address my arguments to the Fifth
Amendment question involved* namely* whether the fruits of
evidence seized as a result of this statement should be held
suppressible.
<r

Respondent contends that the Fifth Amendment* by its
own terms* requires suppression in the case at bar.

Unlike the

Fourth Amendment* the Fifth Amendment is directly concerned with
the introduction of tainted evidence at trial.

The primary

purpose of the privilege against self-incrimination is pro­
tecting the individual against being compelled to furnish
evidence to convict him in a criminal trial.
Respondent suggests that the Fifth Amendment interests
involved in the immunity cases are
ests in the case at bar.

equivalent to those inter­

In both instances a bar to the use

of evidence reinstates the parties to their respective positions
and upholds the privilege against self“incrimination.
Concerning the Respondent's final argument* namely*
that even if the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment were not

42

violated, that even under the rationale of Michigan v. Tucker
that the evidence in the case at bar should still be suppressedc
Respondent respectfully suggests that the interest
of Michigan v. Tucker, that the Government in making available
all available evidence to the people who are to determine the
facts, is outweighed in the case at bar by the need to deter
police conduct, misconduct, by concepts of judicial integrity
and by the very nature of our accusatory system of justice„
It is submitted that the allowance into evidence of
the property seized pursuant to the search warrant would
encourage police violations of the law, because they would
have everything to gain and nothing to lose by interrogating
defendants without obtaining a valid waiver.

Suppression of

the contraband and money is necessary to exhibit to the police
the fact of judicial disapproval and makes constitutional
rights credible to the police»
Respondent also suggests that doubt as to the effec­
tiveness of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule in deterring
police misconduct is not applicable to the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments area of the case at bar»

This is so because, as one

legal scholar has pointed out, the predominant goal of inter­
rogation is to obtain evidence for use in court.

Therefore,

police conduct in this area is likely to be responsive to
judicial rules of exclusion.
Additionally, Respondent respectfully suggesti that

43
the good faith factor,mentioned in Michigan v. Tucker, Is not
applicable to the case at bar.

The interrogation in this case

was post-Ml rand a and Respondent repeatedly attempted to secure
counsel and never abandoned his effort.

Indeed, the state

trooper questioned Respondent knowing that Mr. White had not
waived his rights to silence and to counsel.

That's what the

Superior Court and the Supreme Judicial Court found.
Alternatively, Respondent argues that sound policy
reasons argue against the use of a good faith defense in situ­
ations like the case at bar.

A good faith defense puts a premium

on ignorance of the law and would add an - addit iona land excep- ra­
tionally difficult fact-finding process to the already over­
burdened criminal law process.
Further, the existence of such a defense could gener­
ate uncertainty and invite calculated risks on the part of the
police, thereby defeating the primary goal of Miranda to give
to the police concrete constitutional guidelines.
QUESTION:

Counsel, what's your reply to Mr. Justice

White's concurring opinion in Stone v. Powell that exclusion of
evidence obtained in good faith will never have a deterrent
effect because if people are acting in good faith and reasonably
they will presumably do the same thing again?
MR. COHEN:

Well, I would say, Your Honor, that,

number one, the police officer in this case did not act in
good faith.

The evidence indicates that the police officer

44
knew that the Respondent had not waived his right' to counsel
and his right against self “incrimination.
Number two, I would say that there is certainty in
the law right now, namely, the police should know and hopefully
do know that they cannot interrogate defendants without giving
the Miranda^ warning and without the waiver that is required
/

under Miranda.

Adding into a good faith defense would make a
t

subjective determination.

As to the police officer, it would

aid a police officer who was ignorant.

It would not result in

police officers seeking additional training to try to learn the
law-, and -»
QUESTION:

But if we get conflicts between courts of

appeals and state supreme courts on Miranda points, isn't it
expecting an awful lot that the police officer on the beat is
going to be a final arbiter and know all there is to know about
the Miranda doctrine?
MR. COHEN:
Your Honor.

I think up to this time the law is clear,

Namely, without the waiver and without the

warnings of Miranda no evidence can be used.

That's what

Miranda said and that basic issue I don't think is subject to
attack,
QUESTION:

There is quite a difference of opinion

about what a waiver is,
MR, COHEN:

That's true, Your Honor.

It seems that

waiver can be different in Fifth Amendment situations and

45
different in Sixth Amendment situations.

But we have a finding

here by the Superior Court which was upheld by the Supreme
Judicial Court that there was no waiver.

Respondent respectfully

suggests that in these circumstances .there couldn't be a waiver.
The Respondent was described as not knowing what he was doing*
as bouncing off the walls0

This isn't a case* as the Government

has argued* of some motor impairment.

This is a person who was

described in testimony as not having control of himself.

It is

not a simple case of just having had a point one three on a
breathalyzer test.

There is much more here than that.

This

person could not make a voluntary statement* because of a
problem with his faculties.
QUESTION:

I take it you would say then that there

would be no way that the police* having illicitly heard that
there were additional drugs in the car* they could in no way
get into the car?
MR. COHEN:

I would think* Your Honor* that in order

to seize contraband a limited exception could be created that
would allow the police only to seize the contraband* because
of the nature of contraband.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting then that if the

police officer had said* "Well* I know I shouldn’t have heard
this* but I have heard it.

I do know there is contraband in

the car* so I will just enter the car and take the contraband."
MR. COHEN:

If he had overheard it in the

telephone

46
conversation, there would be no interrogation and Miranda
would not be applicable, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know, but let's just assume that he

heard It from him, like he did,

QUESTION:

Your view is that constitutionally they

are forbidden to get into the car.
MR* COHEN:

Yes.

Or* in the alternative* if they

were able to go into the car* It would only be to seize the
contraband* not to present that contraband in evidence in a
criminal trial.
QUESTION:

Let me test that with a hypothetical

question.
Suppose in the trial of this case* with that evidence
excluded for the purposes on this record — In other words* no
question about the use of the information to get the warrant -=
and your client took the stand and testified and was asked:
"!Did you have possession of any other drugs, except those found
on your person," and he said no0

Under Harris v. New York*

But the Oregon v. Haas situation was a post-Mi rand a.

I would say, Your Honor, that the Court has shown, historically,
a concern for perjury.

And, in that situation, it may very

well be yes, that under Harris and Haas the evidence could be
used for impeachment.

But that question is not before the

Court today, Your Honor0
Finally, Respondent suggests that the nature of the
adversary system and the importance of the dignity and integrity
of the individual requires suppression of evidence obtained by
questioning an individual who was, quote, "bouncing off the
walls," and, quote, "didn't know what he was doing" *—

Even if he were voluntarily bouncing off

the walls?
MR0 COHEN:

I would say, Your Honor, please, that if

a person was voluntarily bouncing off the walls, the previous
case heard here this morning may have some applicability.

He

49

may be suffering some type of mental disease.

But this is not

the case here# Your Honor.
In this case* Respondent was bouncing off the walls
from a combination of drugs and alcohol.

It is in the record

that he was scratching himself incessantly, and that he didn't
know what he was doing.
QUESTION:

Conduct beyond his own control.

MR. COHEN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Thus, Chief Justice Warren, discussing the privilege
against self-incrimination stated, and if I may quote briefly:
"The constitutional foundation underlying the privilege is the
respect the Government, state or federal, must accord to the
dignity and integrity of its citizens. To.maintain a fair stateindividual balance, to require the Government to shoulder the
entire load, to respect the inviolability of the human person­
ality, our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that
the Government seeking to punish an individual produce the
evidence against hint by its own independent labors, rather than
by the cruel simple expedient of compelling it from his own
mouth."
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
further, Miss Smith ?

Do you have anything

50
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA A0 H. SMITH, ESQ0,
CM BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER
MISS SMITH:

Yes, very briefly, Your Honor.

I would like to respond to a question of Justice
Stevens prior to the lunch break, regarding a Sixth Amendment
right to counsel case.
I would suggest that under Kirby v. Illinois that
no judicial proceedings had been initiated and the Sixth
(?)

Amendment right does not apply.

This is not a Gruer v. Williams

case, in any respect.
As to the allegation that there was an independent
state ground for this decision, I would first like to point out
to the Court that on page 70 of the Appendix the Defendant's
Assignment of Error reads as follows:

"Evidence was obtained

as a violation of the defendant's rights under the Fourth,
Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution of the United
States."

He did not assign his error any violation under the

Constitution of Massachusetts.
Furthermore, in the two referenced decisions in the
White case, Haas and Hall, there are references to Federal
cases, particularly, Miranda v0 Arizona and Brown v. Illinois.
In none of the referenced cases in these two decisions, or in
the referenced cases in those decisions, does any discussion
of the Massachusetts constitutional prohibition against com­
pelled testimony take place.

There is simply no ambiguity in the basis for
decision in this case»
QUESTION:

s

I suppose if you prevail and it goes back

they can then rest it on the State Constitution, couldn't they
and reinstate their judgment?
MISS SMITH:

In the future* in another case* they

could rest it on the State Constitution* but I think this case
is before this Court now on the basis ~
QUESTION:

No* no.

I say if you prevail here* and

there is a reversal and it goes back* can't the Massachusetts
Supreme Court rest* reinstate their judgment on the basis of
their State Constitution?

That's what happened in Qpperman*

isn't it?
MISS SMITH:
QUESTION:
MISS SMITH:

It is a possibility, Your Honor.
It is not a possibility —
Yes, they could do that* but they have

given no indication that they ere inclined to do so.

In fact*

in the only case in which the Court has been asked to apply
our constitution more strictly than this Court in a Miranda
related situation* they refused to say that our constitution
required a different holding than this Court reached in 1 torris
v, New York„
