MR. CHIEF JUSTICE RURGER:

We will hear arguments

School District, et al.
I think you may proceed when you're ready, Mr.
Rub!.n.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID RUBIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the petitioner in this case, Mrs. Bessie
Givhan.
The question presented here is whether a teacher
was unp:C"otected by the First l\mendment against termination
of her •"?mployrncmt for the particular views she e>;pressed
r.iercly becau::ie tt.ose views were communicated pri,·ately to her
rather than in a public forum.

MR. RUDIN:

Your lloror.

The diBtrict court in this case found that the

4

primary, indeed, almost the entire reason for the termination
of the petitioner's employment was because of her criticism
of certain policies and practices of her school district and
her school, criticism which was expressed to her principal,
criticism that the policies and practices were racially
discriminatory.
The cou.ct of appeals, while it accepted the factual
findings of the district court, concluded that the communications for which she was penalized were

by the

First Alt.endment because they were expressed privately to her
principal r.ather than in a public forum.
This is a ruling that the respondents have conceded
was erroneous, and rightly so.

Decause if the First Amendment

means anything, it means that an individual is protected
against punishment by the government for expressing a
particular idea.
This isn't to say that F.it·st Amendment interests
are ausolute and that the

The court of appeals thought that to recognize a

free speech interest in a teacher to express a particular
idea to her principal would necessarily imply a right to an
audience with the principal, as the court of appeals put it.
But no right of access of any sort need bP. implied

purposes of this case it may be assumed arguendo that the

case.
QUESTION:

You mean just have a suggestion box

Say that any teacher can put suggestions in

t"1e suggestion bo < if she wishes to address to the principal,
but there's no guarantee that the principal is going to have
t iine to read them?
MR. RUDUJ°:

Well, what I m saying is that there may

be limits that must be placed on whnt the school authorities
do l:y way of barring access.

llut for this case it is

u,necossary to reach that question

because there were

n'J regulations
!-Jell, why -·A, why must there be limits,
111d n,

must t1crc be regulation&, if in the normal course

of the teacher-principal relationship, the teacher knows
ti1at the principal, say, has a meeting from 4:00 to 5:00.

6

J\nd she comes up to him at one miPute to 4:00 and says,
"Look, this policy that you're enforcing seems to me all had,
and I don't think it's consistent with the constitution."
The principal says, "Sorry, I got to go to this meeting. · Some
other time maybe but not now.•
Is that unconstitutional?
11R. RUBIN:

I don't think that it would be.

And

certainly for purposes of this case, the Court need not
address that type of
QUESTION:

Well, but don't you get some sense out

of the 5th Circuit's opinion that the reason for the discharge
here was that the teacher was more or less bugging the
princip:ll, rathe1· than for the content of her suggestions?
MR. RUBIN:

Well, it's clear from the findings of the

district court hore that the petitioner did not harrass the
pri1cipal .
The di£:trict court specifically found that there
\ICre only two occasions on which she comnunicated these
criticisns to him.
QUESTION:

But we deal with the opinion of the

court of appeals, not with the district court's opinion,
don't w:i?
MR. RUnIN:

nut the court of appeals d i d not find

that the petitioner harrassed the principal.
QUESTION:

i7ell, it didn't find that the petitioner

intimation out of it -- that the

the district court's

finding that the primary reason for the termination was the
colllMunications that were made by t·:le petitioner, and the

It did not disturb the district court's findings
which indicated that there had been no narrassrnent.
QUESTION:

And you say it must rise to a level of

employee insists upon more or less taking up time that the

the court of appeal's holding in this case was in error, this
presents this Court with the question of how to dispose of
the certiorari issue, which is in an unusual posture,
admittedly, because both sides have agreed that the court of
appeals holding was wrong.
QUESTION:
MR. RUBIN:

They don't agree the judgment was wrong.
They do not agree that the judgment was

wrong.
QUESTION:

liell, that isn't unusual to find.

Respondents don't entirely defend the reasoning.
MR. RUBIN:

Well, I thought I ought to address

myself to the posture since there hasn't been any debate in
thin Court on the merits of the certiorari issue.
Nevertheless, because we submit the issue is a clear
one

)\

QUESTION:

Well, there's debate on whether we should

affirm or reverse.
HR. RUDIN:

Yes, there is.

And I intend in one moment

to reach that question.
But I wanted to say that we submit the Court should
lesolve the certiorari issue on the merits.

Beceuse that is

the only disposition, it seems to us, thct will assure that
the court of appeals does not adhere to its

in this

case with mischievous consequences.
QUESTION:

What if we decided they used the wrong

9

standard?

l·lhy shouldn't we remand and let them deal with it

first?
MR. RUBIN:

To vacate and remand in light of the

respondent's concession?
No, in light of whatever standard we
thought was applicable?
MR. RUBIN:

Well, the reason is that we believe

that this Court should wrap up thi.1 case now -- and besides
the

question, the respondents have asked that the
of the court of appeals be affirmed on the grounds

that when the Pickering test is applied, the respondents -the petitioner's, rather, expression should be held unprotected.
And we join with

in asking this Court to

decide the issue, although to decide it in petitioner's
favor.

Ar.d we submit that there isn't any real issue to be

decided under Pickering, because there is no legitimate
inter'3st of the s::hool district as empl1·;yer that is implicated
or was implicated by the petitioner's expressions.

They were given in the private context.

Given tnat context, the only purpose that the

As I've indicated, there was no harrassment, because
under the district court's findingu, there were only
t.i? occa3ions on •.ihich these expressions were collllllunicated

MR. RUBIN:

Your Honor, I think there might be a

constitutional issue that could be raised under the Pickering
test.
In other words, there may be -Well, how would you phrase it?
MR. RUBIN1

to go into a public forurr: .

MR. RUBIN:

And

agreed with the

district court on those factual findings, right.
The petitioner spoke not only as a concerned citizen,
but she also spoke as a concerned teacher.

She was concerned

with the impact of the respective roles of blacks and whites
in the school environment from the learning incentives of
her students.
This is in a school of more than 90 percent black
enrollment.

She had taught black 11tudents for many years

the dual systein, and had taught in botn segregated and
desegregated schools.
And she was among those 1,1embers of the collll!lunity
most likely to ha'le an informed opj.nion about the matter that
she criticized.
And for all these reason, we submit that this Court
s'1ould rule that the constitution protect3 her against the

MR. RUBIN:

The Mount Herlthy case was decided

between the briefing of the case ir the court of appeals

14

and the argument of the case in that court.
The respondents asKed for a remand in the light of
that case, but the court of appeals, which had the record
before it -- and reviewing that record, concluded that there
was no serious issue requiring a remand under Mount Healthy.
It's our position that under the decisions of this
Court, the respondents not having filed ?ny cross-petition,
the issue not having been raised in our petition for
certiorari, and the respondents not havirg raised the issue
in the opposition to certiorari, the certiorari petition,
that this Court will not consider that issue now.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BORGER:

Very well, Mr, Rubin.

Mr. Robertshaw.
ORAL ARGUMENT OP J. R03ERTSHAW, ESQ.,
ON BEffALF OF TJ!E RESPONDENTS
MR, ROBERTSHAW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please 1:he Court:
Basically, our position in this case is that the
5th Circuit roached the right result but for the wrong reason,
And I must be perfectly candid with this Court and say that
I don• t think that the First AmendJoont protection is
dependant on the forum or the degree of publicity or the
ma..'\ner in which it is oxerciscd.

15

The question is whether the col!llllunication is or
should be constitutionally protected,
Now I

like to take about two minutes and put

this case in proper perspective.
First, there is a direct relationship between the
quality of a COIQll..mity and the quality of its public
education.
Second, you can't get a quality education without
quality teachers.

Now, how do we do this?

In Mississippi,

a teacher is employed under a written contract, statutory.
She may not be paid unless she has a written contract.
During

terir1 of that contract she may be

discharged only for incompetence, for imm)ral conduct, for
brutal treatment of a pupil, for wJllful neglect of duties,
and for other good cause.
And

courtQ have

that

prof soional

contract is s:>mething not lightly tc be done away with, and
that the statute means what it sayo.
But at the end of ths contract, then there is a
decision as towhether a teacher should or should not be
re-employed.

Now, basically, this question is one of

m;tnagement.
The qucotion is whether or not :he petitioner in
th1s case ehould h ve been re-employed.
that

And we think that

a proper decision to make, and that the manngemont

16

should make it on the basis C>f daily contact over a long
period of time; that the courts are ill equipped to make a
contrary judgment based solely on evidence in a record that
is put on in a formal atmosphere and upon his personal
observation of a teacher on a stand where she obviously is
going to be.
1

But in c1ur Roth and Perry cases, we

held that a teacher could not be d<!nied renewal of her
contract for reasons that violated the First AmendJncnt, did
we not?
MR. ROBERTSHAW:
non-tenured case.

Ptirry V. Sindermann was a

This is a non-tenure case.

And in

Perry v. Sinderrna!!!l this Cou1·t held that a teacher could not
be denied re-employment because of exercise of
conoti tutionally protected r j.ghts, nnd remanded that case
for a d<1termination as to whEither that in fact happened.
Roth, as

underst1md it, simply held that a

teacher -- a non-tenured teat:her

had no right to continue

the cm,,loyir.ent protection by the Fourteenth. -QUESTION:

But- in

tile district court had

resorved ruling on the teachor's First Aroendment complaint,
and simply the caso had come up her on the claim that there
had been a

aenial of proper':y right in a tenure.

And we

held that, defined tenure, and said that just an expectation
isn't tenure.

17

But even a non-tenured t9acher can be -- cannot be
fired in violation of the First Arn9ndment.
MR. ROBERTSHAW1

As I understand -- as I recall the

tacts of the two cases, both Roth and Sindermann were
non-tenured cases.
QUESTION1

Well, supposing you have --

MR. ROBERTSHAW:

Now, in

Supposing you have an employee who clearly

by the state employer.

And the clearly establiahed rea$on

for termination is because he maken a statement on some
public issue that offends the employer.
Do you think that the employer can simply rely on
tll•! doctrine that he has no contra<'tual right to be continued

So you are a siting us, without having

filed a cross-petition for

to modify the

of the court of appeals?
MR. ROBERTSHAW:

I'm --

to

be perfectly frank,

Your Honor, this is my first appea •tmce befc re this Court.

24

I didn't know that if I wanted to raise a point, I had to
file a cross-petition.
But I do think that this Court certainly has the
power to det ermine the rules which should govern situations
of this type and remand the case to the 5th Circuit or to the
district court for proceedings consistent with your opinion.
QUESTION1

So you don't think that -- you don't

think that the court of appeals is correct in saying that
on this record the petitioner should ho -- is out of court.
You

think there should be some further proceedings

go on before her rights are terminated.
MR. ROBERTSHAW:

I think in the intersts of basic

there should be, and for this reason:
The district court's decision was July the 2nd of
1975.

Our reply brief
Well, you don't believe the record that

iS before us is suf!icient for us -- or at least you don't
inaist that we make any determination here based on a new -0n a different standard than the court of appeals?
MR. ROBERTS!!AW:
is euff.i.cient.

No, I don't think thlit the record

I think that it should be remanded under

Do{le, teeause in Doyle you said to the district court,
you should have looked into this.
And th

district court i

1

thio case had no way in

the world of anticipating Doyle, which was not decided Wltil

25

January of 1977.
Now, let me touch briefly on the type of comment that
we're talking about.
And it is, I believe, a significant fact, and one
that I had completely overlooked until preparing in what
I

hope is some depth for this, and that is that the district

c:iui:t in its orders in January of .t970 had retained specific
jurisdiction for the entry of any other orders that might
be nece&sary.
It had full jurisdiction over tha case.

So if in

fact the respondent district had boen quilty of discrimination
in the handling of its administrat.ive personnel in Glen Allan;
if in ft1ct it had been guilty of d &criminatior. in the
handling of the NYC workers; or if in fact it had been guilty
of discrimination in assigning a white to take up tickets
in the cafeteria; then that should have been brought to the
attentiC1n of the dis.trict court an

1

it was not.

And I say to you that it was not brought to the

district coi.:r•; for corrective acti >n becacse there was no
need.
11ow, as I understanci it, tho.Je arethe three points
on wtu.ch they claim First lmandmcn: protection.
Let me take the NYC

so you

couldn't say that we were discriminating in the assignment.
Now this leads to the objection that there were not

Now this

The administrative staff

consisted of the principal, who was white; the assistant
principal, who was black1 the elementary supervisor, who
was black; and the guidance cou."\sellor for the school, who
was

black; and one white secretary.
Now I don't think you clltl say that we

were

discriminating there.
Now let's look at the assi:µu&?"lt of people to the
cafeteria.

The objection in that th? person who took up

the tickets had, quote, th£ choice p•>sition.
