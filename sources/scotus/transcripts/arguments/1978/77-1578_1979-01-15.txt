MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia
Broadcasting, and the consolidated case.
Mr. Topkls, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY H. TOPKIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. T0PK1S:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may It please

the Court:
I appear before the Court representing the American
Society of Composers and Authors and Publishers and various of
its writer and publisher defendants who were sued by CBS In
the Southern District of New York some eight years ago.

With

me are Ms. Amalya Kearse, who will be speaking for Broadcast
Music, Inc., and its various affiliated defendants, and the
Honorable Frank Easterbrook, Deputy Solicitor General, who
will present the government’s vie\^s,

Ms. Kearse, Mr.

Easterbrook and I each have fifteen minutes allotted to us,
and for my part I propose to endeavor to present my initial
presentation in about ten minutes, reserving some five for
rebuttal if time permits.
Now, as the Court knows, this case is here pursuant
to the grant of a writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit,
CBS having sued ASCAP and Its various member defendants and
BMl and its various affiliated defendants under the antitrust

5
laws in late 1969 „

The issue was quite siiTple then and it

remains quite simple today,
CBS claimed that its television network needed to
broadcast a good deal of copyrighted music and that it couldn’t
obtain the licenses for those copyrights in direct negotiations
with the copyright proprietors, therefore, said CBS in its
complaint, it was compelled to take a blanket license from
ASCAP and also from BMI.

A blanket license, as I think the

Court is aware, is one under which the user, the licensee has
the right to use any or all of the compositions owned by all
members of ASCAP — and. we have over 22,000 today

and all

of the more than thirty affiliated foreign societies around
the world on whose behalf we license copyrights, as often,
whenever, with whatever frequency the user wishes, and the
user pays just one stipulated fee„
For a television network like CBS, I may say, that
fee has been running well under one percent of the gross
receipts from sponsors which the network experiences.
The compulsion of which it claimed -QUESTION:

It is not a percentage of gross receipts

or anything like that, it is a dollar amount?
MR0 TOPKIS:

No, Your Honor0

we used as of 1969, it was a percentage.

In the licenses which

NBC and ABC went to stipulated dollar amounts.
haven’t had a license since ’69.

With CBS, we

6
QUESTION:

How much money?

MR. TOPKIS:

^

"\

NBC is something over $4 million a

year; ABC something less than that»

ABC has since come on

rather strongs but they got us when they were weak.
QUESTION:

The dollar figure for CBS, did you tell

us that?
MR0 TOPKIS:

CBS, Your Honor, had settled with us in

1969 for five years, as I recall it, leading up to 869s and
the average for those

it was one lump sum, sums were

allocated to each of the years, but the parties agreed that
that wouldn't be referred to in any court proceeding so I
prefer not to say that.

But the average was something over

$4 million a year for CBS also.
Now, the compulsion of which It complains, said CBS,
violated the antitrust laws in all the usual ways.

We were

accused of everything, block booking, tying, price fixing,
monopolization, section 1, section 2.
sprang, said CBS, from two sources:

And the compulsion
First, CBS complained

that although it had never approached so much as one member
of ASCAP seeking a direct license, CBS was sure that ASCAP1s
members, if CBS approached them, would be disinclined, to deal
directly with CBS„
through ASCAP„

They would insist, said CBS, on dealing

And second, said CBS, there was no machinery

by which CBS could obtain direct licenses for the compositions
in the ASCAP repetoire.

7
These were the central Issues tried out as matters
of fact before the District Court for eight solid weeks.

And

in what the Second Circuit called a painstaking appraisal and
analysis of the facts. Judge Lasker, the District Judge,
reviewed all of the evidence carefully and held against CBS
as a matter of fact on every point0

He said that CBS had not

established that ASCAP’s members would be disinclined to deal
if CBS approached them,

He said to the contrary, the evidence

was that if CBS asked them, they would line up at CBS9 door
anxious to deal because, after all, what is their business.
Their business is selling their music and getting it exposed
on national television for the benefit of the record sales
and sheet music sales which are promoted, of course, by network
television exposure.
On the machinery issue, Judge Lasker said all CBS
had to do was ask, the machinery already existed or would
spring into existence quickly if CBS only indicated its in­
terest c.

And so finding, the District Court dismissed all of

CBS9 claimso
I should note a most unusual aspect of this trial,
and I think it deserves emphasis»
status of suffering victimo

CBS was not claiming the

It didn’t claim that it had

attempted to obtain direct licenses from ASCAP’s members or,
for that matter, from BMI’s members and been refused, nor had
it found that the machinery for direct licensing wouldn’t

8
work.
Rather., CBS’s entire case was the product of specu­
lations of conjecture.
QUESTION:

CBS said, that it --

Mr. Topkis, you answered earlier about

the other two networks, that apparently they have long-term
licenses., of four or five years?
MR. TOPKIS:

Yes, although actually I think, Your

Honor, their licenses have now expired and they are proceeding
on interim arrangements.
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us how long the

license of CBS was that expired in ’69?
MR. TOPKIS:

We negotiated a deal with CBS retro­

active through December 31, B6>9, retroactive to I believe
1962, Your Honor| typically network licenses have been for
five-year periods.
QUESTION:

Take the situation, say, in 566 or so

when they might have started negotiating independently, were
they then under a license?
MR. TOPKIS:
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:

Yes.
Expiring when?
Wall, there was an Interim arrangement.

Your Horror, because the history of dealings between ASCAP and
Its television licensees have been studded by litigation.
there was an Interim arrangement under the
final judgment, as Your Honors perhaps «—

ASCAP amended

But

9
QUESTION

Well , when would the license that was In

effect5 say, in 1966 or ’6? expire?
MR. TOPKIS:

It had no expiration date, Your Honor.

CBS had applied to the Southern District Court, Judge Ryan,
for the setting of reasonable fee for a license, and under
the ASCAP amended final judgment whenever the court gets
around to setting that fee, it will be retroactive to the
time when the application was originally filed.
QUESTION:

But were they obligated — with the fee

uncertain, were they obligated to comply with the blanket
license for the next two or three years —
MR. TOPKINS:
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:

They were —

~ for '66 and '67?
No.

They had the right to drop it

whenever they wanted to.
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:

It was terminable at will?
Yes, for all practical purposes.

Retro­

actively, the court would still have the power to set the
fees but not prospectively.
QUESTION:

What I am concerned with is their argu­

ment that it doesn’t make much sense to go out and get
separata licenses when you are already obligated, you already
have the right to all the music under the blanket license
and in effect would be paying twice for the same music, I am
just wondering, were they obligated to pay under a blanket

10
license during the period whan you suggest they should have
been negotiating?
MR. TOPKIS:

No, Your Honor, they could have can-

celled and gone out into the market.

What the District Court

suggested it would have been shrevrd for them to do would be to
announce let's say six months or a year in advance that they
would be cancelling their license and then set up their direct
licensing arrangements so that on a specific day they could
shift oYer without the slightest penalty.

There would have

been no problem there at all.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the

arrangements

between ASCAP and its members which would preclude ASCAP from
licensing a portion of its portfolio?
MR. TOPKIS:

ASCAP undertakes to license all of the

compositions of all of its members.
QUESTION:

No, that is not my question.

The question

is, is there anything that would prevent ASCAP if it so decided
to say just license one kind of music separately from the
entire portfolio?
MR. TOPKIS:

Well, our agreement with our members

provides that we will license all of the members, all of each
member's copyrights.

Now, whether we could say to a member

we've decided only to license your music in waltz time or
your music in
QUESTION:

Well, that is not my question.

Say you

11
have a hundred members In four different categories, just
assume,
MR. TOPKIS:
QUESTION:

All right.
One Is classical music, another is

popular and another Is waits,
MR. TOPKIS:
QUESTION:

All right.
Is there anything that would prevent

ASCAP if it thought it would be advisable to license a package
just containing waltzes, say?
MR. TOPKIS:

I don’t know just how the amended final

judgmen; would be read on that subject where it deals with the
licensing of specified works, but by category I should think
not.

That is, I should think there x^ould be no written bar.

- °an say It has never been done and I think the ASCAP members
would regard it as a breach of their understanding with ASCAP.
Irving Berlin joined ASCAP to have all of his works
licensed, not to have his serious compositions —
QUESTION:

Say all of Irving Berlin’s go In the

same category, could you license, say, Irving Berlin aid ten
other composers as a separate smaller package without breach­
ing an agreement with any of your members?

Or Is there an

agreement among the members that you must license everything
as a blanket?
MR. TOPKIS:

The agreement provides that ASCAP will

license the members’ entire repetoire.

Not*, I can’t really —

12
QUESTION:

You studiously avoid answering the

question.
MR. TOPKIS:
Honor.

Not deliberately, I assure you, Your

It is not a question that has ever been raised in

ASCAP’s history and all I can say is that I think it would
startle ASCAP’s members to be told that some of their works
were being licensed and not others.
QUESTION:

But what you are telling us is that CBS

could go to separate publishers and say we want to license
your portfolio of music.
MR. TOPKIS:
QUESTION:

Right.
I am asking you If they could go to ASCAP

and say we would like to license just the music published by
"X"?
MR. TOPKIS:

As a matter of contractual right, I

think the issue is in doubt, Your Honor.
say.

That is all I can

I think the expectation of ASCAP’s members is that all

of their compositions will be licensed whenever ASCAP grants a
license.
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:

ASCAP does not promote at all?
It does not promote In the -- well, to

a slight degree, Your Honor, not significantly.

We do make

contributions to country music festivals and we do make
contributions —
QUESTION:

I mean you don’t say that we will take

13
four records and sell them to you, because ASCAP doesn’t do
that.
MR. TOPKIS:

No, no,

We are, after all, we speak for

all of our members, and that perhaps, Justice Stevens, goes to
your question.

We don’t push the work of any member nor the

type music of any member nor country music as opposed to rock
and roll or soul*

That would be entirely out of keeping with

ASCAP*s style of operation.

We exist for the benefit of all

of our members and represent them all simultaneously,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Now —■

You are now dipping into

your rebuttal time.
MR, TOPKIS:

I am indeed, Your Honor, and I will

close very quickly with just this reminder, if I may.

Of the

options that are open to CBS or any other television network,
they are it seems to me of an extraordinary range and extra­
ordinary benefit.

First, CBS has the right, the District

Court found, as well as the ability to deal individually and
get all the music it needs.

Second, if CBS wants to save the

transactional costs and do without the bother and the trouble
of dealing with Individual members of ASCAP, it has the right
to go to ASCAP and it can take its pick between a program
license under which it pays only for each program that it
broadcasts containing ASCAP music or a blanket license where
its rights are absolutely unlimited.
And its options do not stop there, because it has

1*1

the right under the ASCAP amended final judgment in the
Southern District of New York to have the court supervise
negotiations between ASCAP and CBS, so that if ASCAP attempts
to obtain an unreasonable fee the court is standing by to
guarantee that there will be a reasonable fee0

This I think

makes CBS an economic entity having advantages that are just
about unparalleled in our sobiety.

I cannot think of any

other buyer who has the option of dealing individually with
his suppliers or of calling upon them, indeed compelling them
by virtue of the amended final judgment to ban together and
sell him all of their products at a court-supervised price.
I don’t know any other business that has that kind of advan­
tage, that kind of benefit, and with that I will stop.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MISS KEARSE:

Miss Kearse.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent Broadcast Music, Inc., which we refer
to commonly as BMI.

We are here we believe on a simple

question, the question as decided by the Second Circuit, is
whether or not the offering of blanket licenses by BMI and
ASCAP constitutes a per se violation of the antitrust laws.
This question was presented to the Second Circuit
by CBS as a question of law.
of fact of the District Court.

CBS did not attack the findings
CBS urged the Court of Appeals

15
not to make a rule of reason Inquiry.

CBS simply urged the

Court of Appeals to find that as a matter of law the offering
of blanket licenses was per se illegal*
The Court of Appeals did find that the offering of
blanket licenses is per se Illegal.

The court did this

despite the fact that it recognised that the offering of this
kind of license is not a naked restraint;, is not generally
unlawful, is something that is required by some users, is
something that is deemed very convenient by other users.

And

as a result of the recognition of the values and the advant­
ages of the availability of blanket licensing, the Court of
Appeals, despite the fact that it said blanket licensing is
per se illegal, decided that the offering of blanket licenses
should lot be enjoined*
I think the reason the Court of Appeals fell into
the error of finding that blanket licensing is per se illegal
is apparent from one particular passage In its opinion in
which it says the availability of blanket licensing gives the
copyright owner the right to choose the way in which his work
will be licensed.

I say that is error because there is no

support in the record for that at all.
As Mr* Topkis has indicated, the record in this ease
is a bit unusual because we have CBS pressing its claim not
on the oasis of anything that has happened to CBS, because
CBS never attempted to get direct licenses from copyright

16
owners,

The questioning at trial, the questioning on deposi­

tions was largely hypothetical — would you grant a direct
license to CBS If it asked; what would happen, CBS asked, if
we tried to go the direct licensing route.

There was a fair

amount of speculation from CBS' witnesses on this score, but
the speculation came from witnesses who had never talked to a
writer or publisher.
The great bulk of the testimony from knoivledgeable
people in the industry was that direct licensing would
definitely be available.

As one of CBS5 former vice presidents

Mike Gann testified, the top composers and publishers are
intensely eager to have their work performed and the average
composer is out of work.

If you let them know you are in­

terested, you won't be able to get them out of your office.
And this is why the District Court found that the record was
replete with the Darwinian imagery of cutthroat competition
of publishers hungry for performances of their works, and why
he concluded, hyperbolically, of course, but why he concluded
that if CBS just let them know that CBS was in the market for
direct licenses they would line up at CBS* door.

And these

findings were adopted by the Court of Appeals which found
that direst licenses are available, that there can be a
market for direct licensing, that this market can coexist with
the offering of blanket licenses.
QUESTION:

Miss Kearse, there is nothing in the

17
composers contracts with ASCAP then that would prevent them
from dealing directly with CBS?
MISS KEARSE:

Nothing at all, Your Honor.

As far as

BMI is concerned, CBS has raised an issue in its briefs or
attempted to raise an Issue in its briefs as to the avail­
ability of direct licenses from BMI affiliates.

Approximately

a year and a half before trial, CBS and BMI entered into a
stipulation which provided in effect that with respect to the
availability of direct licenses from BMI affiliates, CBS and
BMI would be governed by what the District Court found with
respect to the availability of direct licenses from ASCAP
members, and that -QUESTION:

That factual question is covered by the

findings of the District Court with respect to ASCAP?
MISS KEARSE:

Yes, it is, Your Honor, and at the

trial repeatedly CBS used the stipulation in order to get
into evidence depositions and documents which on their face
related only to ASCAP members and the availability of direct
licenses from ASCAP members, and BMI honored, that stipulation
and I see no reason why that stipulation should not remain in
effect.
QUESTION:
licensing.

We are told that CBS did not seek direct

Did other users do that?
MISS KEARSE:

I know of no instance in which a tele­

vision network has actually sought direct licenses.

1.8

QUESTION:

Do you know of any instance or does the

record show any instance in which a party who has entered into
one of these blanket contracts sought direct licensing?
MISS KEARSE:

We have in the record, Your Honor, two

— evidence with respect to two experiences in direct licens­
ing or attempted direct licensing.

In one Instance — both of

which, I might add, were brought to the court's attention by
CBS.

One is known as the 3M Incident throughout the court

papers.

3M in the mid~X960's decided to offer for sale tapes

of recordings of background music.
blanket license from ASCAP.

3M attempted to get a

ASCAP suggested for various

reasons that 3M go directly to the writers and publishers.
3M did go to the publishers and approximately 80 percent of
the publishers that 3M contacted did grant licenses.

The

other —
QUESTION:

When you speak of 3M, are you not speak­

ing of Minnesota Mining?
MISS KEARSE:
of Minnesota Mining.

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am speaking
It has come to be called colloquially

as 3M.
The other Instance in the record with respect to an
attempt at direct licensing occurred —
QUESTION:

Before you leave that, what is it, 27 out

of the 35 did sipjn up, but there were eight that refused to,
were there not?

19
MISS KEARSE:

There were eight that did not eventu­

ally enter Into agreements.
QUESTION:

Is there any finding in the record —

the Judge did find that there would be publishers who would
line up at

CBS'

door, but is there any finding with respect

to what percentage of the total Inventory of music could be
obtained by direct licensing if they cancelled the blanket
licensing, which I suppose they would have to do before they
•would want to do any separate licensing?
MISS KEARSE:

I believe there is no finding in the

record as to the exact percentage or the approximate percent­
age that would be available by direct licensing.

QUESTION:

But the problem, I take it, 3s with the

feature music primarily, the feature programs?
MISS .KEARSE:

The feature music, most of it; is com-

•K/

b' posed by persons outside of the program packager’s control,
?

A great deal of evidence was Introduced by both sides at the
trial as to the proportion of CBS’ programs that used feature
music.

When the trial started, there were I believe six or

seven variety programs on CBS.

By the time

trial was over,

there was only one»
QUESTION:

I think the findings ivere that the

feature music was small In percentage but extremely significant.

MISS KEARSE:

That it was very small in percentage.

It is significant, but in that the program packagers already
are in touch with the copyright owners of that music, that It
would not be —
QUESTION:

Is there any finding as to how much of

the feature music that would be needed for their programming
they could obtain through direct licensing if they cancelled
the blanket licensing?
MISS KEARSE:

I don’t believe there is a finding

on that score, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

They just don’t differentiate among who

would be lining up at CBS’ door, do they?
MISS KEARSE:

I think the judge concluded that

publishers and writers in general would line up at CBS’ door»
Your Honor, even the eight publishers who did not eventually
enter into agreements with 3M negotiated with 3M, and severe'!
of them, after refusing to enter into the agreements for the
first series of

3M tapes, attempted to reopen negotiations

later with respect to the second series.

Some of them

reached oral agreement with 3M, which 3M then decided were
not appropriate or desirable0
Judge Lasker did find that there was no concert of
action»

All of the publishers had a very real problem with

the concept of policing these tapes after the three-year
license period would expire»

The tapes were to be sold.

The

21
amount of performance royalties was very small.

The job of

policing 20,000 doctors and dentists* offices to see who
could be gotten to pay a royalty fee after that three-year
period had expired would probably be a. game not worth the
candle.

Policing was a concern that was voiced by all of the

publishers with whom 3M dealt.

QUESTION:

Some did not»

How do they police it now?

MISS KEARSE:
QUESTION:

Some of them decided to deal

I think —

Does ASGAP do it for them?

MISS KEARSE:

After the three-year period was overs

only ab :>ut a third of the purchasers of the tapes renewed
their licenses, and I think very little policing went on be­
cause of the small size of the fee that would bo available
and the great cost involved in policing,,

So I think the

policing concern was —QUESTION:

Doesn*t ASCAP generally police the

transmissions of music rsuch as that?
MISS KEARSE;

ASCAP generally polices performances

of music, but I believe that It took the position that with
respect to the granting of direct licenses9 it would not be
appropr: .ate for It to expend the funds that would normally be
expended for the whole membership to police for a fewj and
even when It does polices I gather there is evidence in the
record to the effect that it loses money on the infringement

22
suits that it brings* and the policing that it does»

So it

is not an economic proposition across the board* and certainly
if there are only a few publishers involved, it is not —
QUESTION:

I have some problem understanding the

whole policing concept0

Supposing that this 3M program Just

never asked for a license anywhere* they Just started selling
to doctors and doctors started playing records in their
offices.

Wouldn't ASCAP police that activity just as part of

their general undertaking* engage in policing for their
members?
MISS KEARSE:

I assume that If ASCAP knew about it,

it would do something about It, but in that instance I think
It would have a much easier road to travel against 3M, rather
than against the 20,000 doctors and dentists»
QUESTION;

Is there evidence In the recrd as to how

ASCAP goes about policing?

Do they send patients into

doctors5 offices?
(Laughter)
MISS KEARSE:

I believe that ASCAP has not policed

the doctors and dentists»

ASCAP polices public performances

in night clubs, bars, that sort of thing»
The other evidence of an historical attempt to direst
licensing that is In the record Is the attempt that was made
by Warner Brothers back In the 1930*s when Warners, as a music
publisher, had a valuable catalog that it wished to license

23
directly,

Warner did not want to license through ASCAP and

therefore withdrew its catalog from ASCAP and attempted to
get broadcasters to take direct licenses.

The broadcasters

did not want direct licenses and therefore Warner was
unsuccessful in this attempt.
So of the two historical situations we have in the
record9 we have one user who wanted direct lieneses and got
them —
QUESTION:

In the Warner Brothers situation with the

broadcasters who were not interested In dealing directly, did
they have blanket licenses already?
MISS KEARSE:

They had blanket licenses from ASCAP.

Their blanket licenses did not cover the Warner catalog be­
cause Warner withdrew its catalog from ASCAP,
QUESTION:

I see.

So they would have had to choose

In effect between the —
MISS KEARSE:
QUESTION:

They could have had both,

They could have had them both?

MISS KEARSE:

They could have had both.

They chose

not to take the direct licenses9 they chose to dc without
Warners5 music.

And I point out these two situations because

they are opposite sides of the coin,

In one, the user wanted

direct licenses and got them, and the publishers who wanted
to license only through a middle man did not have his music
used.

In the other, the publisher wanted direct licenses and

the broadcasters wanted to license through the middleman»
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us why the broad­

casters wouldn’t take the Warner portfolio?
MISS KEARSE:
that.

I don’t believe the record tells us

It only tells us the fact that they refused,
QUESTION:

refusal?

Then what inference do you draw from the

What does that tend to prove?
MISS KEARSE:

I think the appropriate inference to

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Easterbrook.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK H» EASTERBROOK t ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States believes that three considerations

25
govern the proper disposition of this case»

First, under what

circumstances should agreements among competitors be held
unlawful per se; second, are the blanket licenses of ASCAP
and BMI so likely to be anti-competitive that they come within
this class; and, third, if blanket licenses are not always
unlawful, should a per se rule nonetheless be employed because
of the particular circumstances of one user or class of users
In music.

I will address those questions in turn.
My first proposition is that per se rules should be

employed only when a particular species of conduct is so
likely to be anti-competitive that a particular trial of
particular circumstances would not be worth the time and effort
because there are so few justified examples of that species.
In those circumstances, there is no reason to go through a
full trial.
Per se rules are attractive precisely because they
are understandable and certain.

They make compliance with the

law simple and they make business counseling easy and they
make trials shorty and they are thus highly desirable, and the
United States has consistently urged that per se rules be
employed whenever that is feasible.

But if certainty alone

were enough to call for per se treatment, all of antitrust
law would quickly be reduced to a series of homilies.

There

must be some reason for each rule.
When we say that certain conduct is so likely to be

26
anti-competitive that we can omit particular inquirys we are
talking about antitrust and economic injury*
focus has been on economic efficiency.

The court’s

When concerted conduct

raises price, reduces the efficiency of production and de­
creases the amount of goods supplied, the consumer loses and
he changes to less desirable substitutes*
The prospect of earning especially high profits also
induces firms to spend their time and resources gathering a
monopoly and all of the resources he used in this way are
wasted*
But the harm In question is economic.

Precisely

because the harm is economic, the court has also considered
economic benefits.

Sometimes collaboration even between com­

petitors yields new benefits, lower costs and so on*
QUESTION2

Mr* Easterbrook, does the United States

have a view as to whether or not the blanket licensing here
haa any impact on the price level?
MR* EASTERBROQK:

The United States, Your Honor, did

not participate in the trial of this ease and lias not fully
examined the record of this case.

There is a legitimate con­

cern I believe about amonopolisation under section 29 because
the trial of this case went off essentially on tie-in and
price-fixing grounds.

The United States believes that the

possibility of monopolisation, what might be termed the Alcoa,
the United Shoe Machinery theory, was not explored

27
as fully as it might have been.
It seems clear from the record in this case that
there are limits on the effect that ASCAP could have on the
price.

At some point, the price ASCAP charges becomes suf­

ficiently highs that it is less expensive fcr CBS or for
anybody else to seek direct licenses.

At that point, any

authority ASCAP might have over price expires.

So in that

sense, It is clear from the record in this case that the
price ASCAP Is charging is less than the price that CBS would
pay through direct licensing, assuming that CBS is behaving
in a rational economic way.
QUESTION:

Also, Mr. Easterbrook, ASCAP has to

operate under the provisions of that consent decree which
gives judicial supervision over at least —
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It does. Your Honor.

It does

provide — there is both a compulsion that ASCAP permit direct
licensing, not interfere with direct licensing in any way, and
a rule ;hat the consent decree court can set a price for any­
one who applies and can't reach an agreement with ASCAP.

I

must say that that never has been done, that is the consent
decree court has never set a price.

There have been numerous

applications to the consent decree court that have all been
settled, perhaps because the

judicial machinery is even less

well suited than the machinery of the Interstate Commerce
Commission to setting reasonable prices for economic goods.

28
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, I am not sure you have

answered my question.

My question is does the United States

have a view as to whether or not the practice of blanket
licensing by the two large sellers Involved here has an impact
on the price level?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I am sorrys Your Honor, if my

answer sounded like an evasion.
QUESTION:

If anything, it sounded like you were

saying it tended to lower the price.
MRo EASTERBROOK:

That is the tendency of my answer.

I must say that I can’t give a definite answer precisely be­
cause the United States does not —■
QUESTION:

If you don’t have a view, you can simply

say no, you don’t have a view.

If you do, I would like to

know what it is.
MR0 EASTERBROOK:

I do not have a view, but there

considerations that Indicate that the price appears to be
lower.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Easterbrook, you are here I

take it as a lawyer and not as a qualified expert testifying
before a priors court as to the licensing of music and what
its competitive effects are.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Most certainly not, Your Honor. I

was just attempting to draw inferences from the record bearing
on the question Mr. Justice Stevens asked.

I am not qualified

29
as an economic expert by any stretch of the imagination.
QUESTION:

No, but I understood your* analysis at

first see to have some relationship to your judgment about
the economics of the situation.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It does, but that is also drawn

from the record and from this Court’s eases.
My point was that there are some forms of collabora­
tion between competitors that are undoubtedly beneficial.

The

formation of new firms, the mergers between existing firms and
the creation of joint ventures all involve competitors or
potential competitors who cooperate in some way or other.
It is precisely because of these forms of economic
cooperation without which one cou3.d not have cooperation or
indeed much of any other economic enterprise, that are
beneficial to the economy, the Court has been hesitant to
apply per se rules to economic cooperation.
The basic distinction I am suggesting in the formu­
lation of per se rules is the one recognised by Judge Taft
in his famous opinion in Addyston Pipe & Steel and an important foundation of antitrust law between naked restraints and
economic integration.

Naked restraints between competitors

rarely produce economic benefits and, because they sometimes
cause loss, they are deemed unlawful per se.

Forms of

economic integration, on the other hand, although they contain
the potential for economic loss, also contain a great

30
potential for gain0

*

That brings me to my second propositions which is
that ASCAP is not a naked restraint.
of joint venture.

ASCAP is clearly a form

As a rule, blanket licenses issued by ASCAP

produce real benefits,

A blanket license is a product that

only a joint venture can sell.

No composer;, no small combin­

ation of composers can sell what ASCAP sells.

What ASCAP

sells is the right to use great quantities of music on the
spur of the moment, without searching for a composer, without
negotiating for a contract, and without fear of infringing
anyone’s rights.
Users of music apparently find that package of rights
valuable, if only because of the cost of searching for a com­
poser and negotiating a contract in many cases exceeds the
total value of the music.

The figures given by CBS at page

22, the first note of its brief, disclose the costs of
negotiating composition by composition through an agency, and
they run from $5 up per composition.

For many uses of music,

radio, oars, and the like, the total value is significantly
less than $5.

And without some form of license of the sort

ASCAP offers, those transactions would never take place at all.
QUESTION:
ASCAP.

Mr. Easterbrook, you repeatedly refer to

Am I to understand that you mean that generically to

include BMI?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I do mean it generally to include

31
BMI.

I am generally referring to the practice of offering

blanket licenses.
In any event, with apologies to Dr. Laskey, if there
were no A3CAP, it would be necessary to create it.

The blanket

license is beneficial to music users and its economic value
rather ;han any arguments about market necessity makes per se
treatment inappropriate.
To say, as CBS does, that ASCAP is unlawful per se
because It fixes a price is to make antitrust law depend on
totalogi.es.
price.

Of course ASCAP fixes a price.

It must fix a

Every firm, every joint venture sets a price for the

thing it makes, and the members of the firm or the joint
venture don't compete against each other within the firm to
sell the thing they make at a lower price.

There is no compe­

tition in the sale of ASCAP licenses because only ASCAP makes
ASCAP licenses, and similarly there is no competition in the
sale of BMI licenses.

There Is also no competition in the

sale of Shick razors because only Shick makes Snick razors.
That is a trivial argument.
The Important question is whether there is competi­
tion in the sale of performing rights, not whether the joint
venture Is trying to compete

with itself.

On that score,

ASCAP and BMI have very little in common with price fixing
cartels.

The cartel tries to drive up the prices by curtail­

ing supply.

Here there is no curtailment, indeed because of

32
the low price under the license, it may he that there is too
much music use.

The cartel tries to stop competition among

its members or at least they agree not to compete with one
another individually.

There is no such agreement here, and

it seems conceded and the District Court found that they
would line up at CBS’ door if they were asked0
So my argument so far has been that blanket licenses
produce economic benefits.

The per se rule does not apply to

them precisely because a joint venture of this sort, offering
a product of this sort has some economic utility.
QUESTION:

Why do you suppose, Mr. Easterbrook9 the

individuals haven't lined up at the door anyway?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice White,

so long as

CBS maintains its blanket license —
QUESTION:

Has it got one now?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

It is operating under an interim

allowing it to use all of ASCAP's and BMI's repertoire.
QUESTION:

I know, but it is terminable at will or

whatever —
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

It is terminable at will.

Is there anything in the record to in­

dicate that any individual has ever come around to CBS v/anting
to license individually?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

The only indication in the record

on that is the Warner Brothers episode which was discussed by

33
Miss Kearse, in which someone came to CBS ~ not necessarily
CBS, but to users, to radio networks and were turned down.
The reason for that — not necessarily the Warner episode,
but the reason in general, if one publishing company showed
up is that under the A3CAP blanket license CBS has the right
to use i;hose compositions at zero marginal cost.
pay additionally for them.

They won’t

The impetus to change the system

has to come from the user who can announce, say, as of a
year from now I will stop buying a blanket license and will
shift to either individual licenses with particular composers
or to program licenses to pick up those things on which I
don't make individual deals»
QUESTION:

So you think that the copyright, Individua

copyright holders just know when they would be doing a useless
thing?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It would be completely useless for

them to go to CBS now.
QUESTION;

Mr. Easterbrook,

is there something

under these arrangements that prevents the — I should say
first, assuming there was no ASCAP arrangement at all, is
there anything to prevent anyone from broadcasting or copying
a copyrighted piece and then keeping a record and paying the
royalty?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

As a matter of convenience, it

may be ;hat if you keep a record and pay a royalty, no one

314
would prosecute you* but in fact the law requires that you
have the license before you make the broadcast.
for free economic bargaining.

That provides

If you first broadcast it and

then go and tender $2, it is very difficult to reach an
unbridled economic agreement between a seller of rights and
*

a buyer of rights.

It is a faite accompli, the deal is

closedo
QUESTION:
you not

You can make a copy of a recording, may

under that $2 arrangement?
MR. EASTER3R00K:

There is a provision in the law

with respect to mechanical recordings,, providing that anyone
can use a copyright for a little more than two cents per
copyright, and that compulsory license was put into the law
because of difficulties in policing because of difficulties
in setting royalties , et cetera.

But that is I believe the

only provision of the law providing for a compulsory license
at a determinate fee.

In other cases, fees are supposed to

be negotiated in advance to seek the permission.
QUESTION:

Is it a criminal offense to play it

before you get the license?
MR« EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

It Is a criminal offense.

Mr. Easterbrook, part of your answer to

the Chief Justice reminded me of CBS' argument with respect
to music that is already In the can, as it is called, recorded,
and the fact that with respect to that there wouldn5t and

35
couldn’t be free negotiation, for the same reason that you
indicated in part of your answer to the Chief Justice.
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Justice Stewart, that is

I think a little difficult to determine, how those negotia­
tions would come out.

As we say in our brief, that has some

of the characteristics of bilateral monopoly.

CBS which owns

the music in the can can say unless you give me a license for
cheap, I will never broadcast this and you will never get a
penny.

The owner of the copyright can say unless you pay me

a great deal of money, 1 will deny you a license and you will
never be able to get to broadcast it and it is worth a lot of
money to you to broadcast it.
QUESTION:

And it is that latter that CBS is arguing.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

It is a two-party holdup, and

what the District Court found was that in the circumstances
of the two-party holdup, a fair price would be reached.
There are other answers to the music in the can
problem, among them the per-program license.

If for some

reason CBS is unable to obtain individual licenses on those
kinds of things, It can obtain a per-program license avail­
able under the consent decree.

And there is also I believe

some oddify in CBS’ making this argument because for years it
has always had the option of obtaining a contingent license,
a license in the nature of If we ever drop the blanket license
we are licensed to perform this at a royalty of blank percent

36
or blank dollars»

That license, a contingent license of that

sort should be easily available in the market on request»

CBS

has never requested such a license and to this day has not
attempted,
QUESTION:

And that kind of a license would cover

music In the can?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, it would, and it would

alleviate the problem prospectively.
almost a decade ago,

But the suit began

CBS has had the option of seeking such

licenses and has never sought them.
QUESTION:

It would have to pay for such a license,

would it not?
MR, EASTERBROOK:

It is not clear, Mr, Justice

Stevens, what the nature of the payment might be,
QUESTION:

Well, they would have to pay something,

I don’t imagine the publisher just as a matter of charity
would say here, you can have this option.
MR, EASTERBROOK:

It is in the nature of an option,

Mr. Justice Stewart, an<^ options are generally available al­
though not necessarily at a high price.

But the promise to

pay, the major promise to pay would be if we ever use it out­
side a blanket license, would promise to pay.
QUESTION:

But wouldn’t you agree that there must

be a pr .ce paid even for the option?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I would certainly agree that you

37
would have to pay a price for the option»
QUESTION:

Which would be money down the drain if

they never cancelled the blanket license»
MR. EASTERBRQOK:

Yes.

But their argument, of course,

is that they want to cancel the blanket license and they want
to set up. circumstances under which they can do it.

The point

I was making was that they have not set up the circumstance
and now It is very hard for them to complain that they can be
held up when they haven't done what Is necessary and within
their power to prevent the holdup.
QUESTION:

If they are willing to pay for it.

MR» EASTERBROOK:

Yes»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN J» HRUSKA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HRUSKA:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It please

I represent CBS, the plaintiff in this case and

the respondent on this appeal.
The principal issue on this appeal Is the correct­
ness of the Court of Appeals determination that defendants
fix prices or, more specifically, whether a combination of
otherwi e competing music publishing corporations are fixing
prices in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act when the
prices at which they sell music performance rights for tele­
vision network use are not deteiUTuned by a process of price

38
competition but are determined and set by the combination it­
self and are indeed annual single package prices to a pool of
all the members' copyrightsc
By law, copyrights on original music compositions
are granted to the composers of those compositions.

As a

matteir of practice, those copyrights are assigned to the music
publishing corporations.

And the licensing of music rights

to motion picture producers,to the makers of phonograph
records

and to the publishers of sheet music, music publish­

ing corporations do deal directly with those users and do
engage in price competition.
rights

In the licensing of performance

’or television network use, such as CBS, music publish­

ing corporations manage to sell in a thoroughly non-competitive
way insofar as price is concerned.
How do they do that?

By a far more structured, con­

trolled and pervasive system than any ordinary price fixing
arrangement.

In the routine price fixing case, it is common

to find that the sellers have gotten together, not uncommonly
in a hotel room, either by explicit agreement or by some wellplaced words and some winks and maybe some nods, have agreed
to set price at maybe $1,000 a unit.

Quite rarely will any

of those sellers leaving that room actually sell at $1,000 a
unit.

They will negotiate down from that price, but it will

be a focal point for negotiations, and such an arrangement is
obviously illegal per se.

39
Here the music publishing corporations do not agree
to sell individually at $1,0G0 a use.

They agree to have a

central instrumentality, a joint sales agency, ASCAP or BMI,
sell a blanket license to their entire pool of copyrights at
"X” million dollars a year and then to distribute $1,000 to
themselves in respect of each use the licensee makes of their
music.

Now, this quite obviously is a very effective means

of eliminating price competition among otherwise competing
sellers, of removing —
QUESTION:

Mr. Hruska, what is your answer to the

petitioner’s contention that if you have two individual
general contractors that go into partnership, they cease
competing, too, and bid as a unit rather than formally as
they did supplying two separate prices.

This wasn’t tried

under a monopolisation theory, was it?
MR. HRUSKA:

Yes, it vras.

We have charged in this

case price fixing, tying and monopolization.

We definitely

did try them in a monopolisation ease.
QUESTION:

And did the District Court and the Court

of Appeals rule on your monopoly ease?
MR. HRUSKA:

Yes, Indeed, they did.

The District

Court ruled, that ASCAP and BMI were not monopolistic because
they were not the sole source of supply of the music in their
pools.

That ruling we claim was wrong as a matter of law.

A monopolist need not be the sole source of supply.

Monopoly

is measured by the handicap that the monopolists can impose9
and the handicap here,, as I will get to in a few moments3 is
quite significants based on the District Court’s own findings,

MR. HRUSKA:

We are not talking about two

than that.

What they have done is far more effective

They have created a central instrumentality which

has control over that price, which insures that price.

Now,

if there is anything anomalyous in the antitrust laws, it
would be to on

the one hand prohibit a garden variety hotel

room fix with no centralised control with cheating all over
the place, as is common in routine price fixing cases, and on
the other hand permit the same sellers to do it the most
efficient way, to take price completely out of the harsh
realities of the competitive marketplace.
If the steel companies were doing this, if the
steel companies turned all their

steel over to a joint sales

agency, the American Iron & Steel Institute, and then have
that Institute sell their steel at $1,000 a ton, a defense to
that case would be laughed out of court.
QUESTION;

Well, what if two relatively minor steel

companions merged and from then on they had a common sales
agent who quoted a single price?
MR. HRUSKA:

Well, if they merged, obviously under

existing law the basic distinction we make -- we test that
under section 2 or section 7S and we do that because we
perceive certain benefits commonly achieved in monopolisation
eases, and we perceive the antitrust tools, sections 2 and 7,

43
adequately to judge whether those benefits outweigh the anti­
competitive effects.
QUESTION:

If I understand it, you would like to

stay on both sides of this question,
MR. HRUSXA:

Well, you do though, don’t you?

MR. HRUSKA:

QUESTION:

Are you defending a result, a remedy that

the Court of Appeals gave which according to your theory Is
price fixing?
MR. HRUSKA:

In the unique circumstances of this

case, that happens to be sensible relief, like the relief
granted In National Lead and Haseltine and all of the other
eases that —
QUESTION:

So you still suggest that you are on both

sides of this question,
MR. HRUSKA:

Well, if that is both sides, then I am

but I should say that compulsory licensing on reasonable
royalty terms has been granted in patent cases, in the National
Lead case and in the Hazeltine case and a block of others, it
could be directed to the individual music publishing corpora­
tions, rather than ASCA? or BMI, although 1 don’t think that
makes much difference.

The par-use system is an interim

measure, naturally inherently it Is going to be an interim
measure, and that is so because the very process of per-uae

^5
licensing is going to break down the barriers of direct
licensing that I will get to in a few moments.
QUESTION:

If you are allowed to,
V

MR. HRUSKA:
QUESTION:

Yes,
I hate to continue the interruption* but

sometimes the theory has trouble filtering through a very*
very long brief.

I would lik© to know whether your price

fixing theory is that it Is per se unlawful to have two
competitors use a common sales agent, for example* automobile
companies sometimes use the same -•» say* a foreign ear company
and a domestic company use the same dealer.

That is — under

your theory, is that per se unlawful* or alternatively is it
your theory that it is only unlawful when it is a substantial
portion of the market* for example, all of the automobile
companies using a common sales agent?
MR, HRUSKA:

Well* It is certainly our position that

when a substantial portion of the market uses a common sales
agent* it is per se unlawful* and It is not our case because
we have not only substantial portion of the market, we have
the entire market Involved in this casse.

But it is also our

theory* to be consistent with our theory* that if several

or

two otherwise competing sellers use a common sales agent*
that In almost all circumstances that I can conceive of, that
should be unlawful per se, and the reason I say that is it Is
very difficult to conceive of a situation in which those two

companies —- let’s take the worst case* from my standpoint -»
those two companies in order to achieve whatever integration
benefits they are trying to achieve with their joint sales
agency really have t© fix the price.

We have in this market,

MR, HRUSKA:

the music publishing corporations, which handles the licensing
of the mechanical rights and rights for motion — performance
rights end synch rights for motion picture producers, does not
fix the price.

They get individual quotes from each music

publishing corporation.
Now, you can run a common sales agency that way*
There is nothing against it*

In other words, each time the

common sales agent wants to sell the goods of one of the
members of this joint venture, he simply —

QUESTION;

Just so I understand your theory th@n9

your theory does not depend on the percentage ©f the market

MR® HRIJ8KA:

True, It does not depend upon the per-

MR® HRUSXA:

That's right, as long as he is fixing

the price for his members, in essence, or his clients or his
customers®

Now, on the other hand, a ruling in this ease

does not necessarily have to decide that question because, as
I keep coming back to, we are not dealing with two little
companies in a very large market®

We are dealing with all ©f

the companies in the market.
Now, the ASCAP defendants say we have a consent
decree.

When you, the*television networks were formed and

t

took your first license in 19^6, ASCAP®s right to license ©ur
pool was effectively exclusive, as the Court of Appeals found®
But In 1950 that piece of paper, that consent decree was
changed®

Now that piece ©f paper makes ASCAP * s right to

license non~exclusIv@.
Well, that Is very Interesting, on© might say8 but
has anything in fact changed for twenty-nine years as a
result of altering that on© word on a pies® of paper, and the

clear answer to that Is no, nothing Is changed»

Are you still

selling your performers1 rights at prices fixed by the ASCAP
board, as you have done for sixty-five years, and the answer
to that question is yes.

And is that piece of paper somehow

to unfix the prices at which you are actually selling through
ASCAP, and the answer to that is no.

And don’t the conspira­

tors in ordinary prise fixing arrangement also have the right
to sell at individually negotiated prices in view of the
fact that price fixing agreements are unenforceable, of course
the answer to that is yes.

And aren’t the ease books filled

with successful price fixing prosecutions of people involved
in a fix, who frequently departed from the fixed price, and
of course the answer to that is yes*
But ASCAP says, y©u9 CBS, should ask, you should
ask the music publishing corporations to engage in Individual
negotiations.

Why?

Why?

Does any customer of a price

fixing consortium have any obligation in law to ask teh®
conspirators to please atop fixing prices to himself and all
of the other customers in the market as a precondition for ©njoining the fix?

Certainly not.

The fact that otherwise

competing sellers are selling at agreed upon prices is
enough.
If ten major oil companies fixed prices at $1,000 a
barrel, could there ba any doubt at all that a single buyer
of oil who had refused to deal with those ten companies

conspiratorsj any doubt at all that that company could enjoin
the fix?

QUESTION:

Is it entirely fair, Mr. Hruska, to

The policing
Musis publishing

corporations can police alone or they can police jointly* but
they don’t have to fix prices in order to police.

But some organisation, each individual

would It not?
MR. HRUSKA;

I think under the Aiken decision and

on copyrights.

Now, In today8s world, anybody who wants t©

buy a phonograph and a phonograph record, whether h© is
running a barber shop or a hotel or a doctors office can set
that record player up and start playing music.

don*t think It is an infringement.

of this is really a separat® thing.

— ASCAP or BMX were Incapable of polic­

organisation like ASCAP.

But as a matter of logic and as a

matter of plain economic fact, which no one really disagrees

about, in order for publishers

MR. HRUSKA:
QUESTION:

I stand corrected.

(Laughter)
MR8 HRUSKA:

I was up to the point where I was

positing the situation of major oil companies conspiring t©
fix prices to their fifty largest customers and suggesting
that the fifty-first customer would plainly have a right to
obtain an injunction against that price fix because the con­
spiracy would obviously pollute the market in which that
customer was attempting t© buy»
So that if CBS were to drop Its ASOAP license and
attemot to bypass ASCAP, CBS, like the fifty-first customer
of oil, would certainly have the right to enjoin the price
fixing that was still going on directly in sales to ABC and
NBC, even though CBS has stopped dealing with the cartel.
QUESTION:

Again «=— and Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked

you If the analogy really is fair — the fifty oil companies
don’t sell anything that no one company could sell.

But in

this ease the government particularly stresses the point that
ASCAP sells a product that n© one composer could sell, namely
the blanket license, and that the blanket license has
independent economic utility.
MR. HRUSKA:

How do you respond to that?

Absent conspiracy, 20th Century Fox

cannot market the films made by MGM and United Artists and
Columbia, Pictures and all ©f the other motion picture companies,

but that is not excuse for price fixing, that is a definition
of price fixing.
Now, the department’s point is literally based on
several "benefits'1 that the department believes it perceives
in this situation, and those benefits are illusory.
are things that we don’t need.

Those

What we are dealing with here

when those benefits are cited to us is a fixed price and a
fancy bottle.

The benefits consist of immediate access to

songs as soon as they are written, that is very nice, and —
QUESTION:
MR. HRUSKA:

It is a benefit, too, Isn’t it?
But It is totally unnecessary.’

If we

have got to choose between getting a competitive price and
getting a fixed price in this particular fancy bottle —
QUESTION:

Well, maybe you would rather have some­

thing else, but I don’t think you can deny that there are some
benefits to the blanket license.
MR. HRUSKA;

They are not appreciable.

They are not

significant, and they are not Justification for price fixing.
QUESTION:

Well, as soon as you admit that there

are some benefits, it seems to me it destroys your analogy to
the oil companies and all the rest.
MR. HRUSKA:

I don’t believe so, Your Honor, because

oil companies can create benefits, too.

Any cartel of sellers

can manufacture benefits if they cartelize their sales.

For

example, In some industries, you could have a situation where

55
fifty sellers would simply fire most of their salesmen, then
achieve transactional efficiencies and they would be able to
do so becuase they had a common sales agency»

Are we going

to permit price fixing to go on because that happens?

That

is a benefit, but it is certainly not a benefit justifying
price fixing,
QUESTION:

I get lost when anyone deals with a

comparison of fifty oil companies selling oil presumably In
about the same kind of containers and the kind of situation
we are dealing with here.

What Is being sold here under the

license is not fungible, is it?
MR. HRUSKA:

No.

They make it fungible by selling

a blanket license, but it is not naturally or Inherently a
fungible product.
QUESTION:

But the licensee doesn't just call up and

say send me some music and accept jazz music when he is
running a station which emphasizes classical music.
MR. HRUSKA:

On the contrary.

A great deal of in­

vestment is engaged in by the independent packager of each of
these programs and simply the selection of the music for his
program, so it is not fungible.

On the other hand, the

District Court did find that copyrights in various classes
are reasonably interchangeable and they compete with each
other, so we are not dealing x^ith non-competitive products.
We are

certainly dealing x^ith copyrights that compete with

56
each other when they are beinp; purveyed to motion picture
producers.

Indeed, one of the ironies here is that some of

the motion picture producers are the very people who are
making television programs, and when they deal in motion
pictures, when they are making motion pictures in their
studioes, they are getting competitive prices on music, and
when they are making television programs in their studioes,
they are not.

We have the market, as I say, cartelized.

But I would like to inject some further reality into
this situation, the realities of purpose and effect»

In the

first place, we ought to look who the music publishing cor­
porations that populate the A3CAP board year after year are,
who are they that set these blanket licensing fees»

They are

Warner Brothers and they are 20th Century Fox, and they are
MCA, Universal and Paramount which, as we all know, Is a
subsidiary of Gulf+Western, and United Artists, a subsidiary
of Transamerica, and Chappel Music and Sherman Music and
Shapiro-Bernstein, and the like, the hard core of the old-line
music publishing corporations which control the standard
compositions that are used so often on television networks.
In other words, we are not dealing here with economic pigmies
on the other side, and is there any doubt at all about their
purpose In maintaining this system, the purpose of this
combination, that It is to maintain prices.
there is none? at all.

I submit that

57
Their very counter-claim in this case flatly states
that CBS’ attempt to enjoin the blanket licensing system is
part of a plan designed to depress the price paid for music
performance rights.

And if their purpose in opposing the

elimination of the blanket licensing system is to avoid a
depression of the price, their purpose in maintaining the
blanket licensing system is obviously to maintain the price.
In other words, this argument by the ASCAP defendants is
substantively identical to the argument made by the Society
of Professional Engineers that competitive bidding would
pressure price reductions.

It is as clear an admission of

anti-competitive purpose as one could possibly find, and it
is far from the only one.
We have cited a rather large collection in our
brief, such as the speech gix'en by ASCAP's President some
years ago that the central purpose of ASCAP and the Writers'
Guild and similar organizations was to resist the splitting
of our rights so that we could be picked off one by one.
Well, the testimony given in this case by ASCAP's board
member and officer, Mr. Brettler, who is also the head of the
Shapiro Bernstein Publishing Company, that the benefits
belonging to ASCAP which he describes as a leal monopoly, were
that in unity there is strength and in disunity there is
weakness.

The record is filled with these.
And just as revealing of the defendants’ intention

58
to maintain prices through the blanket licensing system are
these facts:

ASCAP pays out to its members on a per-use

basis, i.e.9 it pays its members $1,000 for every feature use
of their music on a television

network, but ASCAP refuses to

take in on a per-use basis, i.e., it refuses to charge the
networks separately for each use.

Is blanket licensing

therefore unnecessarily restrictive and deliberately so, that
is, deliberately designed to preclude price competition?

Of

course, it is, the blanket license is an all or nothing deal,
either you take the entire pool or you get nothing.

That

means if you take the entire pool that direct licensing is
obviously silly because no one is going to pay twice for the
same music.
If ASCAP agreed to take in on a per-use basis, that
would mean that the program packagers, the people who make
the television programs and sell them to CBS could immediately
start direct licensing for the preponderance of the composi­
tions they use, both music written originally for television
by their own staff writers and publishers music, and get some
form of price competition, and so could CBS for the relatively
few programs that It makes itself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hruska, what do you understand the

theory of the Court of Appeals was In indicating that the
only thing that is wrong with this arrangement is that
licensing Is not on a per-use basis?

Under the Court of

59
Appeals decision,, ASCAP would be wholly acceptable as long as
it licensed on a per-use basis, is that it?
MR. HRUSKA:
Your Honor.

Well, they didn't say that exactly,

They said ASCAP — they said that the price

fixing, the antitrust violation that was going on might be
relieved by the per-use system.

On the other hand, they

recognised that the per-use system might have a continuing
effect on direct licensing prices, they weren*t persuaded
that that was so, but they thought it might be so, and they
suggested that this be tried out.

But the v?hole suggestion

there I suggest is —
QUESTION:

What was the theory of the suggestion

that perhaps per-use licensing might survive?
MR. HRUSKA:

Well, because the Court of Appeals

perceived that the present system creates a substantial dis­
inclination, in other words cartel created values here to be
preserved, and the Court of Appeals recognised those values,
as this Court did in the Masonite case, and —
QUESTION:

As I perceive your argument, you are not

accepting that theory?
MR. HRUSKA:

Oh, no, on the contrary, I am wholly

endorsing that theory.

In fact, I argued it to the Court of

Appeals.
QUESTION:
MR. HRUSKA:

You are?
Yes, and I think it is right.

60
QUESTION:

ASCAP may proceed as long as it gives

you a better break?
MR. HRUSKA:

No.

If that is the theory you mean

that I am wholly endorsing, the answer is I accept its 1 do
endorse it, even though I must note on behalf of my client
that we would prefer to enjoin the system entirelys to enjoin
blanket licensing for television networks.

Now, the reason

we prefer that —
QUESTION:

Are you submitting — of course, that

would give you more of a remedy than you've gotten.
MR. HRUSKA:

It would give us a more effective

remedy I think ultimately, although there are arguments the
other way.

It would certainly expand your relief

MR. HRUSKA:

QUESTION:

I don't know how you can have it both

Right now there is a remand to the District Court

under wiiich a per-use licensing might ~ would be tried out,
and under your theory it shouldn’t be tried at all.
MRa HRUSKA:
myself clear.

No, Mr. Justice White, I haven’t made

Let me try to do so now,

I think in a rela-

tively short period of time — and I hesitate to quantify that

61
exactly, but in a relatively short period of time, either
form of relief is going to end up at the same place.

Now, the

reason I think that — and there is lots in the record to
support this — is that if you start with a per--u.se system,
that means ASCAP -™ that music will be available from ASCAP
at whatever the court sets as a price, "X" dollars of use,
and indeed the court may not set the price until he sees what
the prices are under direct, licensing transactions and gear
the per-use price to that»

But wherever that price is set,

that will be the amount of money for which per-use you can
get msuic from ASCAP.
On the other hand, you can also deal directly with
the music publishing corporation»

Now, to get to a perfuse

system, obviously there must be a declaration in this case
of illegality.

That declaration, coupled with the inaugura­

tion of the per-use system, is going to announce to the
music publishing world, as it must, that blanket licensing
is over, there is no further possibility of blanket licensing.
They will have no choice whatever, short of a boycott, they
will have no choice whatever then for the first time to
create the direct licensing facilities.
We’ve got to recognise that we are dealing with the
music publishing industry that lacks the personnel, the
established operating procedures, any of the forms, any of the
consents they are going to have to have from their writers to

62
engage in direct licensing, none of that is in existence,
none of that is in place.

The District Court found — excuse

roe,
QUESTION:

The District Court found, Mr, Hruska,

that you gave them a year’s notice or a year and a half or
something like that, there would be plenty of time to set up
all of that machinery,
MR, HRUSKA:

Yes, the District Court found that with

a long period of advance preparation, which he pater particu­
larised at page 107 of the record — and I make a note of
that page because that is a very important page to resolve
a dispute that seems to have some about through the reply
briefs.

It is clear as day that he found that from the time

that CBS announced its intention to engage in direct licens­
ing — and he also said there would be no creation of direct
licensing facilities until CBS made that announcement —
from the time that CBS announced to the time that they — I
think he referred to it as well-oiled machinery would be in
place that would permit direct licensing to occur, would be
at least a year.

That is what he said.

Now, he also suggested to us a lot of things that we
might do during the process of that year.

We might require

the movie companies who make our programs to cough up the
catalogs of their music publishing subsidiaries, presumably
on threat that their production services would not be greeted

63
with favor by CBS unless they did that.

He suggested we go

out and get mini-blanket licenses which are probably tying
under this Court's decision in Loew's and Paramount»

He

suggested that we go a lot of other things,
Now, I suggest, Your Honor, I suggest that this sort
of rigmarole to get yourself into a competitive market is
really far worse than the rigmarole that a customer for
engineering services had to go through in the professional
engineer’s case.

After all, we recognise that that customer

if he wanted to nominate one engineer and get his price and
then rescind that relationship and then nomination another
engineer and so forth to get himself access eventually into a
competitive market.

But here we are dealing with a far bigger

problem and we’ve got to at least expend all of these efforts
and take all these risks and buy all these options that Your
Honor referred to before, and all economists in this case
agree, we would have to pay for those options and pay dearly,
we have to go through all this rigmarole to get to a compe­
titive market, and I just don’t think the antitrust laws
require that.

And bear in mind, the professional engineers

case was not a case in which the engineers had agreed on the
prices at which they would sell.
Here is a case in which the otherwise competing
sellers are agreeing on the price at which they would sell,
and there is no possibility, if we went through this rigmarole

and If we did pay the penalties on music in the can, there
is no possibility that we would get a competitive price.
Every ASCAP publisher knows, every time he sees a piece of
his music being used on CBS, that is $1,000 in his pocket.
If we abandon our ASCAP license, if we tried to license
directly, the first place he Is going to start,

his first

frame of reference is going to be $1,000 a use.

We have

plenty of testimony in this case about that, it is an admitted
fact.

You see that in the briefs.

ASCAP is saying in their

reply brief, you may be right, but what is so wrong with
that, why is that any different from what any other seller in
any ordinary market does, takes into account prior prices.
But here we are talking about not the influence of
the seller’s own prior prices, not the influence of the
competitive market prices, we are talking about the influence
of a consortium, price, of a price that has been rigged, of a
price that has been agreed upon, and that is different and
that effect is inelectable..
Now, the Court of Appeals said it wasn’t persuaded
that that effect would occur, and I suggest that that was an
error of logic and economics.

This was an admitted point by

economists, by the parties themselves, and once you — and it
is an obvious point — and once you. get a stabilisation
effect like that injected into a market, it doesn’t go away
unless you can reduce the price to zero, and that doesn't

55
exist outside of some pathological economic textbook model0
It certainly doesn't exist in the motion picture field, where
motion picture companies are paying between $750 and $20,000
for each use.

BMI makes a ceiling price argument related to

the perfuse license which couldn't possibly have any effect
at all if music prices could be driven down to zero.
The District Court made a finding in the 3M inci­
dent that a lot of publishers refused to deal because the
money wasn't high enough.

And remember who we are dealing

with on the other side of this bargaining table.

We are not

dealing, as I said before, with economic pigmies, and it is
not even CBS who is going to be buying the music, it is going
to be the independent packagers, and those are the same people
who very often pay $2,000 or $5,000 or $10,000 for music
performance rights when they are making motion pictures.
QUESTION:

Do you agree that the record doesn't

indicate at all why it was that the broadcasters didn’t want
to deal with Warners, in that episode?
MR. HRUSKA:

Well, the Warner Brothers incident

occurred in the thirties, it was radio broadcasters, I don't
think anybody was around still who was there in the incident
except for one music publisher. Buddy Morris, who is a member
of the 1SCAP board, and Mr. Morris 3a5.d that one of the
reasons that Warner Brothers backed down and backed down
pretty soon — I mean, this thing didn’t get off the ground,

66
really

one of the reasons they backed clown was because the

v/riters were up in arms, and why were

the writers up in arms,

they were up in arms because of what they perceived to be
Warner Brothers’ disloyalty to ASCAP.

QUESTION:
MR. HRUSKA:

The composers, you mean?
The composers, yes.

And the 3M inci­

dent, well, you know, we don’t really attack the court’s
findings in the 3M Incident except for the arithmetical mis­
takes that the court made, which you have got to look at
under the 3M as all the evidence the court did not look at.
In 27 out of 35 he said dealt, and he said 8 didn’t deal and
even that is wrong, it was 9 that refused to deal, not 8.

And

when you compare the publishers who refused to deal, the 9»
who by ASCAP’s credit system account for ^0 percent of CBS’
uses ~~ and that is ASCAP credit system, you can’t evaluate
music in terms of equal numbers of compositions because some
music is more valuable than other music and the credit system
of ASCAp does that, and so that is probably the best way we
have right now7 of evaluating the uses.

The 9 who refused to

deal supply 40 percent of CBS’ uses.
The 27 or 26, whatever it was, who refused to deal

67
In the —
QUESTION:

Who did deal,
— who did deal, was a de Minimis per­

The total of them was 3,5 percent.

When you take

out 3 of them* which I will com® back to in a moment, you get
down to less than 1 percent.

The three big ones who dealt

were Jewel Music, and the President of Jewel Music testified
in this case and he said he wouldn’t do it again, he made a
bad mistake — this is in our Addenda A — he said that when
ASCAP is licensing a category of users, he believes that Music
Publishing Corporation should not — this was Jewel Music.
And. then we had two other big publishers, Shapiro, Bernstein
and MCA.

The President of MCA almost lost; his Job over this

whole thing, it was so embarrassing that the attorney for 3M
had to offer to tear up the contract and the publisher, the
head of Shapiro, Bernstein who licensed said that the com­
parison between licensing this trivial way which was found
money, an absolute windfall, and from his standpoint he ex­
pected to get as much as $500,000 for the licensing, and
licensing of a television network was grains of sand compared
to watermelons.

He made a speech at the ASCAP board which

said, you know, if we license these people at 3M and get this
thing off the ground, they are going to have to come back to
ASCAP anyway.

That is how he justified It0

QUESTION:
just ask you this:

That is sort of a digression®

Let me

In the motion picture market and in the

sync right market, where I understand there is per-use
transactions taking place —
MR® HRUSKA:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— are there also blanket licenses offered

In those markets?
MR. HRUSKA:

I do not believe so, Mr. Justice Stevens,

no, and a synch writer and performance writer Is licensed In
one transaction and they are licensed a use at a time, and
that Is a sensible way to license music.

I think in the

short time I have remaining I would like to jump to the rule
of reason point and really mainly to make the point that the
Court of Appeals really decided this case on rule of reason
grounds as well as per se grounds.

That isn't the label

that the court used, but that is obviously what it did, in
addition to holding this form of price fixing to be per se
illegal,

The Court of Appeals looked to see whether this

price fixing was necessary for any market functioning pur­
pose and found that it was not, the Court of Appeals looked
to see whether this system created a disinclination to com­
pete and found that it did Inevitably.

The Court of Appeals

looked to see whether there was a less restrictive alterna­
tive and found that there was, the per-use system, and all of
these were rule of reason determinations.

And this was

69
obviously the basis of Judge Moore's concurrence which the
defendants suggest was irrational»
Moreover, there is nothing of cognisable economic
value that this unnecessarily restrictive system can be said
to provide that would not be better provided by a competitive
market»

All we have really heard, and it is not really a

rule of reason consideration, is that CBS is too big to be
permitted to deal one on one with Aaron Copland or George
Gershwin or the writer of several songs, but CBS will not be
dealing with Aaron Copland even to the limited extent CBS is
producing its own programs»

The independent packagers will

be dealing with them as they now deal with authors and actors
and scenergy designers and set designers and everybody else
who supplies elements for television programs, except ASCAP
supplied music.

And as I said before,, the people who write

music for television get between $1,000 and $2S500 a week, so
it is plain that those people have adequate bargaining power,
I guess the last point 1 want to turn to is the
\

defendants’ expressed concern in their brief for treble damage
liability if this judgment is affirmed.

That too obviously

has nothing to do with the rule of reason determination, but
it should be
this lawsuit»

also I think it has very little to do with
CBS has not sought damages in this case,

treble or otherwise.

The television stations have recently

sued in New York, and they haven’t sought damages either.

And

70

if any group of users sue and if they do seek damages, and
this Court believes for any reason that these music publishing
corporations should not pay damages, this Court has the in­
herent power to so decide, so this case will not decide the
question of whether music publishing corporations must pay
damages.

What it should decide, I submit, is that price

fixing is unlawful, whether committed on something as beloved
as a popular tune or on any other right, commodity or service.
QUESTION;

You are hot suggesting that the Court

has discretion to decide in a suit for damages, a legitimate
suit for damages whether the damages in an antitrust case
shall be treble or double or single, are you?
MR. HRUSKA;

I am suggesting that the Court has

discretion not to award damages under
QUESTION;

Any damages»

MR. HRUSKA;
damages, exactly.

«—> even though there is liability, any

Yes, Your Honor, I am suggesting that.

QUESTION;

But it has no discretion if it awards

damages to say, well, in this case it will be single damages
or double damages or one and a half times or one and threetenths, but just actual damages, does it?

That was suggested

in City of Lafayette, I think»
MR. HRUSKA;

Well, I think it is a nice question

and -QUESTION;

Isn*t the answer pretty clear?

71
MR. HRUSKA:

Well, you could argue ifc both ways.

mean It has just never been decided.

If I had

1

run a brief

on that, I would say if you are going to ax-zard damages, it
ought to be treble under the statuta.
QUESTION:

Congress gave some thought to that, didn't

they?
MR. HRUSKA:
QUESTION:

Well, they apparently did.
I think, Mr. Hruska, if you find an in­

jury to the business or property of the plaintiff, they asfc
for damages, where does the judge get discretion to say no?
MR. HRUSKA;

Prom the Simpson Oil case in which

this Court stated exactly that. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But that had to do with retroactivity

of a new rule, didn't it?
MR. HRUSKA:

Yes.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Topkis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY H. TOPKIS„ ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. TOPKISs
please:

Mr. Chief Justice, and If the Court

I attempted to reserve a couple of minutes.

I will

use no more than that, of course.
I think there was a question put about what the
situation is today and so I thought I would perhaps bring the
Court up to date on that.

The fast is that today the Columbia

Television System Network holds no license whatsoever from

72
ASCAP nor so far as I am aware from any ASCAP member.

It

cancelled the license It held with us many months agos shortly
after the Second Circuit came down with its decision.

It has

been playing ASCAP music constantly ever since that cancella­
tion.

It has paid neither ASCAP nor anybody else one dime for

the exploitation of copyrights in which it has engaged, and it
has merrily told us that if we bring suit for infringement on
behalf of any of our members, it will defend with a claim
that we have misused our copyrights and so it Is immune
against any claim for infringement, we are not privileged to
enforce our copyrights.
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:
BMI, Your Honor.

That is where matters stand today.

The same with BMI?
So far — I won't attempt to speak for

I am not sure of the fact there.

Now, that causes me to plead with perhaps special
vigor for this Court, If it agrees with us that there has
been no per se violation of law, not to remand this eight-yearold case for further Inquiry or further trial or further
anything else, but since the District Court found that CBS
had failed totally in every assertion, of fact that it made,
we submit that the proper course is to end the matters here
and in effect to serve notice on the world that antitrust
litigation really is not and will not be tolerated by this
Court to be endless.
I ask the Court to remind the parties here that it

73
can sometimes make sense to negotiate rather than litigate»
We have been standing ready to do so for years and we still
are,

We would welcome the opportunity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Topkis9 I asked your opponent about

the motion picture market and the sync right market, and he
said there were no blanket licenses in those markets.

And I

would like to ask you, Is that correct as a matter of fact,
and if so, I wonder why not if they have an economic utility?
MR. TOPKIS:

Well, Your Honors I take it means a

film company asking for a blanket license from ASCAP?
QUESTION:

And the sync right market also applies

to television, doesn’t it?
MR, TOPKIS:
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:

The sync rights applies to television,
Let’s just take the sync rights then,
Well, sync rights are negotiated in­

dividually in dealings between the producer of a show for
television and the copyright proprietor.

When a producer

discovers that he needs a song9 he calls up usually through
the Harry Fox Agency and gets a quote on the sync right.
Those transactions are relatively rare, Your Honor, a few
hundred a year is the totality of them, and I think that
probably explains why there are no blanket licenses for them,
QUESTION:
MR. TOPKIS:

Because they are s© infrequent?
Yes.

There is on© lady in New York

who handles the whole thing and

QUESTION:

But it is correct, there are no blanket

licenses?
MR. T0PK1S:
QUESTION:

There are no blanket licenses.
Nor in the motion picture market?

MR. TOPKIS:

Certainly not In the motion picture

market.
QUESTION:

Would you give the same answer as to the

reason Tor no blanket license in the motion picture market,
that they are so rare?
MR. TOPKIS:

Well, in the motion picture field,

Your Honor, we are enjoined under the amended final judgment
from granting licenses,in any way dealing in licenses for
performance rights.

ASCAP is not in that business, so we

couldn’t issue a blanket license.
QUESTION;
MR. TOPKIS:

Is BMI also enjoined?
I don’t know.

Again, I xvill leave It

to Miss Kearse to acquaint Your Honor with the facts there„
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

The

case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:40 o’clock a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
