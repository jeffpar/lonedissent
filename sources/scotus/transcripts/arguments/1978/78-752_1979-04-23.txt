PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 78-752s Baker v. McCollan.
Mr. SoRalle, I think you can proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. W. SORELLE, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SORELLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The respondent brought this section 1903 action
alleging a violation of due process under the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution.
uncontroverted.

The facts are basically

The respondent was born on December 8,

19^9, and originally given the name "Llnny," spelled
L-i-n-n-y.. "Carroll," C-a-r-r-o-1-1, "Mc.Collon," o-n.

He

informally adopted the name which he uses today in this
proceeding, with a diff

ent spelling of Linnie, the

middle name "Carl’' and "McCollan," a-n.
The date of birth Is significant only because
later, by 1972, the respondent had a Texas driver's license
identifying him as "Linnie Carl McCollan" and through an
error the birth date of "December 8, 19^8" was inserted
and even though he knew of it did not correct it and there­
fore it became part of his assumed identity.
QUESTION:

And whose date of birth was that?

MR. SORELLE:

No one that we know of, Your Honor.

4
These facts would not be particularly significant except
for the remarkable coincidence — and I say a coincidence
because that Is all the record will support — that the
respondent's older brother, whose true name was "Leonard,"
decided in 1972 to adopt the identical assumed name and
went so far a3 to seek a duplicate driver's license in
the name of "Linnie Carl McCollan."

Unfortunately through

some area of the Department of Public Safety, the same was
Issued and the older brother Leonari had a driver's license
that identified him as Linnie Carl McCollan, date of birth
December 8, 1948, all information the same including the
driver's license number being identical,

the only differ­

ence in the two driver's licenses being the photographs on
the license themselves.
Then, unfortunately, Leonard, posing as —
QUESTION:

Didn't one of them say "duplicate"?

MR. SORELLS:

Yes, sir, probably — I think you

are absolutely correct, it would have said "duplicate" on
the one that Leonard had.

In any case, you are right, it

would have said "duplicate."

But other than the word

"duplicate" and the photograph, the identifying Information
was identical.
Leonard, acting a3 Linnie, was than arrested in
October of '72 on a drug violation, was booked as Linnie
Carl McCollan, was released on bail as Linnie Carl McCollan,

signed all the papers that he signed as Linnie McCollan,
and then left town presumably because his bondsman later
surrendered the bond and sought to have a warrant issued
for the missing Linnie Carl McCollan.

The justice of the

peace dutifully issued a warrant for the arrest of Linnie
Carl McCollan, a copy of which is in the appendix.
One significant item on this point.
was issued on November 3, 1972.

The warrant

This suit is against

petitioner Baker who was sheriff of Potter County, but he
was not sheriff of Potter County up until this time.

In

fact, certain events in this case, one being the death of
Sheriff Gather, his predecessor.

Sheriff Baker was then

appointed on November 20, 1972, to the office.

Then the

respondent becomes involved when on December 26, 1972, a
Dallas police officer stopped the respondent for a traffic
violation., reported the name and identification and
identifying information through their central office and
was informed that there was a Potter County warrant out­
standing for Linnie Carl McCollan.

He dutifully arrested

him, took him to the station, the respondent protested
that he wasn’t the man wanted and there- Is no evidence of
whether this was a unique statement, but in any case the
police officer did ask his superior to contact Potter
County, they compared the identifying information and, as
you might expect, said, no, this is the man, that is the

6
man we want with the warrant.
On December 30th, a Potter County deputy with a
warrant went to Dallas, picked up the respondent, returned
him to the Potter County jail on the evening of December
30th.

Sheriff Baker, against whom this action is brought,

was not present at the jail at that time and had left for
the evening and was going to b® gone over the New Year’s
holiday.

Aid even though he had contact with his office,

he received no notice of any protest by the respondent,
that he was not the right man wanted.
QUESTION:

This duplicate driver’s license, at

what stage did that gat into the hands of the person to
whom it was not lawfully issued?
MR. SORELLE:

This was earlier, in 1972.

I am

sorry, I do not recall the precise date, but I believe it
was issued sometime in 1972.
QUESTION:

Did Linnle Carl MeCollan give it to

his brother?
MR. SORELLE:

Mr, MeCollan said in the trial

that he didn't know how his older brother came by the in­
formation.

It was demonstrated that the applicant for the

duplicate license himself, the applicant, which would
have been Leonard, gave the specific identifying information.
The respondent admitted' that his brother would have no way
of knowing that he had an erroneous birth date on his

7
driver’s license, that he had not told him, and he didn’t
know how he knew this.

In any case9 there is no evidence

in the record to support precisely how brother Leonard
obtained the information.
QUESTION:

Another point, was he fingerprinted?

MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, the -—

Well, did they agree Kith the other

fingerprints?
MR. SORELLE:

No, sir, Your Honor, and this is

the point that is being raised by respondents in this case.
When Leonard was arrested as Linnie Carl MeCollan, he was
fingerprinted and photographed.

He was arrested and booked

through the city police department, then transferred to
Potter County, but Potter County also photographed and
fingerprinted Leonard.
At the time they did not take — and this was one
of the points that respondent makes -- they did not take
fingerprints and photographs with them to Dallas when they
picked him. up.

They returned him and apparently did not

compare the photographs at that time.

Immediately, on

January 2nd, when Sheriff Baker arrived back at the jail
and was informed that the man was contending that he was
not the correct Linnie Carl MeCollan, he immediately in­
vestigated, compared the photographs and the arresting
officer had kept the duplicate driver's license that had

8
been issued to Leonard, for some reason knowing that there
was some problem with it, and they brought respondent down
from the jail, the sheriff discussed it with him, asked
him whose picture was on there, he said it was his brother
Leonard, the sheriff acted on his own to release him,
arrange transportation back to Dallas.
QUESTION:

If they had sent that to Dallas, all

of that would have been avoided, wouldn’t it?
MR. SORELLE:
made.

This is the assumption that is

We don’t know whether the photographs, had they been

sent to Dallas, certainly someone would have known sooner
that the contention was real, that he possibly wasn't the
person.

I cuestion personally whether — I don’t know

whether a police officer in general has the authority to
make this determination, but in fact they were not sent so
there was no comparison made until the second —
QUESTION:

Well, don’t the police officers send

fingerprints: over the wire on the hour?

Isn’t that a common

procedure?
MR. SORELLE:
don’t know.

I assume it is, Your Honor,

I

There Is no particular record in this case

about this, but there was some statement, they could have
been mailed, they could have been s«;nt to Dal3.a3, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Does this particular sheriff’s office

have facilities for transmitting fingerprints by mail?

MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

I mean by wire.

MR. SORELLE:
graphic method.

Well, by mall.

I don't know if they have any tele­

It is not in the record and I personally

don't know, Your Honor, whether they do or not.
QUESTION:

Did this particular place have the

fingerprints of both of them?
MR.

SORELLE:

The place where he was ultimately

held and released?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And couldn't they have given to the

officers that went to Dallas?
MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Thera was nothing to stop them from

doing that, was there?
MR. SORELLE:

No, sir, and we are certainly not

contending; that there was.

Our initial position in this

case is simply that vie have not stated any violation of due
process where there is arrest pursuant to a warrant that
describes the individual in the warrant, that the
respondents on this would be tantamount to suggesting that
due process not only requires identification to a warrant
but that the most efficient means of identification must
be used or one cannot rely upon the warrant,

And it Is

10
our position that in this case the police officer has
\

traditionally been held to the standard that he must have
either a valid warrant, and there is no contention this1
warrant is not valid, or rely upon probable cause.

Her^
\

the arrest was supported, the arrest and; confinement by
the valid warrant in the name of respondent.

The

respondent, as in the case of anyone who is arrested and
later aeuitted, was determined not to be the one who should
have been arrested, and he ims released in due course
through the investigation.
So the threshold question we believe the Fifth
Circuit overlooked was whether there was in fact a violation
of due process, because there was in fact a warrant for the
arrest.

The Fifth Circuit reasoned from tho reverse side

of the case by concluding that it being demonstrated after
the fact that he should not have been arrested, therefore
it was a false imprisonment, that fils® imprisonment Is an
intentional tort and under their own case of Bryan v. Jones
it can be read to suggest that the only thing necessary for
this tort is that someone was in fast confined, he was
aware of his confinement, and suffered injury by it.
However, even under Bryan v. Jones, there was a
preliminary finding and that is that there was a confinement
without any process, and it may be that under Monroe v.
Pape we can presume intent to confine without process when

11

there is in fact no process.

But it seems a little far­

fetched to presume intent to confine without process when
there was in fact process naming the person to be arrested.
The second difficulty with the Fifth Circuit’s
initial approach to the case is that they concluded that
Sheriff Baker could be held responsible for the acts of
his duties because it was necessary in this case to attribute
the acts of the deputies to Sheriff Baker if he was to have
liability.

They did so by simply suggesting that he is

responsible for the acts of his deputies, he authorised
them to go so then in fact he committed the confinement.
Again, we find it rather difficult to conclude
that Sheriff Baker intended to confine the man when his
first action upon learning that this particular man was
^confined wan to investigate and release him.

And the only

way we cart get to Sheriff Baker on the confinement is to
apply the doctrine of respondeat superior which we believe
this Court should — as well as in the city cases in
Monell — should extend your conclusion there to loc en

...■■■■

Respondents would take on 2 further step and say
that the sheriff in Texas is responsible for the actions
of his duties , and he Is statutorily responsible for super­
vising the deputies and can be held as a surety for them.

12
But It would not be reasonable to use this as a basis for
extending respondeat superior to the sheriff because then
it would tend to make 1983 a variable statute depending on
what state statutes happen to apply in any given jurisdic­
tion.
The Firth Circuit acknowledged that there might
be some question her® on respondeat superior, so they then
shifted their analysis to the sheriff and suggested that
it should be the sheriff’s own acts or conduct.

The sheriff

did not act affirmatively in any way to confine or restrain
the respondent„ therefore they suggested that it was a
failure to act, a failure to have implemented a policy of
transmitting photographs and fingerprints which he himself
/

....

said after the fact as a result of this, he investigated
and determined that this would be a good policy.
QUESTION:

Well, when you talk about respondia

superiore, fr, Sorelle2 aren’t you ordinarily talking
about the liability of the supervisor for the negligence
of his employees?

And here as I understand it, the

deputies were simply carrying out the instructions oif the
sheriff.

That wouldn’t be respondeat superior 9

to say

that the sheriff is liable if he directs one of his
deputies to go and arrest somebodys would it?
MR. SORELLE:

No, Your Honor, if in fact ha

direct him to go arrest this particular person.

What he

13
authorized them to do was to execute the warrant , and I
think it would be a little far-fetched to suggest that he
Intended that they arrest the wrong man and that in author­
ising a deputy to execute a warrant that he has then
authorized them to misapply the process.
I understand your question, and it is probably
so, but we are dealing here with a question of whether
someone has committed intentional conduct.

It appears to

m® that we are thinking of questions of xfhether intentional
conduct has been committed and presuming that the conduct
has been.
I understand fully the position

• - or I think I

do —- that specific intent to violate a statute may not be
required, but it has always seemed in the past that this
Court has required that at least there be some intentional
conduct.
QUESTIO?!:

That is the point' I am won led about,

If the sheriff said it is my policy, don’t check behind
these warrants, go and pick up whoever it is ■— but that
is not this case, is it?
MR. SORELLE:

No, sir.

The sheriff certainly

didn’t suggest that, and all the evidence In this case
indicates that the sheriff, number one, was displeased
with it.

He acted — the only affirmative conduct shown

in this case by the sheriff has all been in ultimate good

faith.

The moment he had notiae, he acted to release him.

The moment he investigated and determined what caused it,
he acted to change the policy.
We raised also in our brief the evidentiary
question that this in effeet should not in any circumstance
be evidence of negligence because of the federal rule of .
procedure thatstates that you don’t us® corrective action
to prove the negligence of the initial action.

But our

feeling is there is no intentional conduct directed toward
depriving the respondent of a federally protected right.
QUESTION:

Suppose ~ I take it your position is

though that even, no matter how negligent the sheriff
might have been — and you say he wasn’t negligent at all
— no matter how negligent he might have been, 1983 just
doesn’t reach you in that kind of conduct.
MR. SORELLE:

Not any level of negligence, no,

sir, I don’t think —QUESTION:

Well, maybe not wrecklessnes, but ~

MR. SORELLE:

Wo are talking here about simple

negligence because there was -QUESTION:

Suppose there was a failure to exer­

cise reasonable care her© to ascertain whether they had
the right man.
MR. SORELLE:

Yes, sir, aid under those circum­

stances we would hold that 1983 does not reach that conduct,

15
a simple inadvertent failure to take some precaution, un­
less it reaches the level where there is a known duty and
the failure to act could come within the intentional dis­
regard or deliberate indifference standards that have been
set out in some of the —
QUESTION:

Well, known duty is the duty not to

hold somebody without probable cause to believe he has com­
mitted a crime.
MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, but that —

And would you say you should take

reasonable care to do that duty?
MR. SORELLE:

Yes, sir, and I think in that case

where you are relying on a warrant, it is probably — you
should take reasonable steps to identify the man as being
the man named in the warrant.
QUESTION:

But the respondent —*

Suppose there wasn't those reasonable

steps taken in this ease?
MR, SORELLE:

Well, there is no evidence concern­

ing the reasonableness of the steps taken.
QUESTION:

Just suppose they weren’t, suppose it

was conceded that there were not reasonable steps taken to
identify the person.
MR. SORELLE:

And if there was a known duty to

take these steps, then I think we may have that —
QUESTION:

I don’t know, that is part of the

16
question.

You know you are not supposed to arrest the

wrong man.
MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Suppose there was a failure to take

reasonable steps to identify the person you are arresting.
Now, let’s just suppose there was a failure to take those
kinds of steps.
MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Ye3, sir.

Would you think 1993 would reach It

or not ?
MR. SORELLE:

I think this starts getting closer

I think and that should be part of the plaintiff’s burden
to show that there were not reasonable steps, and under
those circumstances I think if it reaches the level that
you could suggest deliberate indifference, intentional
disregard for your attempts to arrest the man, yes, sir.
If it is a simple negligence, failure to — without any
knowledge of a pre-existing problem there, it would be my
position that that would be an extension of the 1983
beyond any holding of this Court in the past.
QUESTION:
saying for e. minute.

Mr. Sorelle, can I test what you are
This standard, whether it is deliber­

ate indifference or negligence or intention, and so forth,
/

where do \m look to see what that standard is?

Do we look

to the constitutional violation that says he shouldn’t put

17
a man in jail without a trial, and so forth, or do we look
to 1983 which says in effect if there is a constitutional
violation you may recover, or do m look to the defense of
good faith immunity?

There are sort of three different

places that standards could be found.

Where do you say we

look to find out whether it is neligence or deliberate
indifference or what?
MR. SORELLE:

Well, I believe that you first look

to the statute 1983 to determine, since that is the statute
under which you are recovering, to try to determine whether
this requires intentional conduct.
QUESTION:
subject at all?

Well, is there anything in 1983 on this

It simply says, doesn’t it, that if there

is a constitutional violation, a person then has a remedy?
Mli, SORELLE:

It says that one who subjects or

causes one to be subjected, this leaves open the question
I believe of whether they were talking about whether you
need active conduct.

It implies subjects or causes one to

be subjects in my mind implies that someone must have done
something and therefore I would feel that it would require
some intent., some intentional act, and then going beyond
it, behind that, I think when we look at the Congressional
Record of the debates, it is inconceivable to me that the
drafters of this statute were in any way thinking of unin­
tentional conduct.

The complete review, they were talking

18
about crimes of deliberate failures to enforce the law,
deliberate violations of persons’ rights.

And so I believe

that the statute Itself, some initial threshold determina­
tion must be made.
QUESTION:

Isn’t it true that the "sheriff’s

office" was the cause of this man being arrested, the cause
of him being transported back to Potter, and the cause for
him being hold until the sheriff turned him loose?
MR. SORELLE:
QUESTION:

Well, the —

The "sheriff’s office."

MR. SORELLE:

— the sheriff had nothing to do

with Issuing the warrant.
QUESTION:

I said th© "sheriff’s office."

MR. SORELLE:

No, sir, the sheriff’s office had

nothing to do with th© issuance of the warrant in the name
of Linnie Carl McCollan.

That was issued by a justice of

the peace.
QUESTION:

Well, who told Dallas to hold him?

MB’. SORELLE:

Well, they ■— when a warrant is

issued, apparently this is communicated -QUESTION:
hold him?

Well, who told th® Dallas people to

Who went to get him?
MR. SORELLE;

The Potter County Sheriff’s Office

went to get him.
QUESTION:

All right.

When they —

19
MR. SORELLE:

Certainly, unquestionably they in»

tentionally confined him, but they did not intentionally
confine him without a warrant or without process in any
fashion.
QUESTION:

But they are the ones that did deny

him his right to freedom.
MR. SORELLE:

If you have a right to freedom

that is unfettered without any ability to rely upon process,
yes, sir.

It is my belief though that the police officer

must b® able in some fashion to rely upon process in the
name of the person to be arrested and in fact they did,
and In fact there were procedures used to determine that
he was the wrong suan and he was in fact released by the -QUESTION:

That was on January 2nd, and he got

back to Potter County about December 30th?
MR. SORELLE:

December 30th, in the evening,

and —
QUESTION:

Didn't he then protest that he was

the wrong man and didn't they then have fingerprints avail­
able right there?
MR. SORELLE:

Yes, sir, and they did not — the

officers that were there did not prepare them.

Of course,

Sheriff Baker, as I say, was not there —
QUESTION:

At that point it was under the juris­

diction of the sheriff's office at least?

20
MR. SORELLE:

It was in the sheriff’s office,

unquestionably, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

In Texas, is it true, as in most

places 1 have observed, that public offices aren’t really
beehives of activity over New Year’s weekend?
MR. SORELLE:

Yes, air, and unfortunately this

was the case in this office at that time, and certainly
that should not necessarily ba a reason, but the evidence
indicated that th© normal I.D. people weren’t there and it
takes certain people to compare fingerprints and photographs and the sheriff was not notified of the man's con­
tentions , because immediately being

go

notified they did

act to reles.se him.
Your Honor, if I might, I v/ould reserve the rest
of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Larson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. LARSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LARSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

the Court —
QUESTION:

I am. not clear on the fact3 hero yet,

either from the reading of the appendix and records or the
argument.

How did this unauthorized license get in the

hands of — the driver’s license get in the hands of the

21
unauthorised person?
MR. LARSON:

Your Honor, I don’t know and I don’t

believe my client knows.

It is quite possible — the record

has several situations under which my client obtained
driver’s licenses.

It Is quite possible that his brother

may have stolen a copy of one of his several driver’s
licenses.

In fact, if you read the cross-examlantlon by

them, you will find that the plaintiff in this case in th©
trial court had several driver’s licenses and, prone as he
was to lose them, he applied for more, and It is quite
possible, I would think, that brother Leonard stole one of
them but we don’t know and w® have no way of knowing, and
my client has Insisted from th© very beginning that he
doesn’t know how Leonard got his driver’s license.
I want to say one other thing.

This isn’t In

the record, but my client’s parents were functionally
Illiterate and the mistakes on his birth certificate were
due to their illiteracy and nothing else.

He was told all

during his life that his birthday was the date, that Is on
the driver’s license, at least that is my understanding of
it.

In addition to that, his name was misspelled because

his mother imd dad didn’t know how to spell very well.
Now, I believe this case is —
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:

Is his name Linnie?
Yes, sir.

22
QUESTION:

And his brother’s name i3 Leonard?

MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And how was Linni® misspelled, as

Leonard or what?
MR. LARSON:

Well, he says that his birth cer­

tificate has L-i-n-n-e-y on it and not L-i-n-n-i-e.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR, LARSON:

That is what his contention is.

I don’t think when Congress passed 1983 they
passed the statute in a vacuum,

I think that when they

passed the statute, they recognised that there were cer­
tain tort principles that war® going to be engrafted on
this statute.
QUESTION:

That was a long time ago.

MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, It was.
Do you think they had this kind of

■suit in mind at the time?
MR. LARSON:

Well, I believe that there was

some question before Congress as to whether or not Negroes
were being properly treated by the lav; enforcement —
QUESTION;

Well, vfouldn’t you be here whether

'

;

.

or not yourclient

was a

Negro?

)

|

MR. LARSON:

Yes, sir, but that doesn't change

the fact that the statute, when it was originally passed,

;

|

I believe,wasdirected against the [southern states for
/

f

23
their actions against Negroes.
QUESTION:

Do you have a cause of action in the

state courts of Texas?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sirs I believe we do.
Why didn't you go there?

MR. LARSON:

Well, because I don’t like to try

these kinds of cases In the state courts of Texas, Your
Honor.

The fudges are not very favorable to these kinds

of cases there.

I have attempted to exercise the constitu­

tional rights of several people in the. state courts and I
have found some of the judges to be somewhat less than
receptive or as receptive as they ought to be.
QUESTION:

Is Amarillo the county seat of Potter

County?
MR,. LARSON:

Yes, sir.

When Congress passed"the statute, this was not
done in a vacuum, it was done withxthe idea that there were
some cause

of action that were automatically going to b©

engrafted, because of th® development of the common law
were going to be automatically engrafted in 1983.

Now,

•

this Court has already recognised In a couple of cases, in
Pierson v. Ray and Monroe v. Paper, a false arrest case,
but I don’t think this Court has ever had before it a false
Imprisonment case.

And the issues are a little different

in that in a false arrest case you can use the defense of

good faitb.s but I don’t think that applies in a false im~
prins oilmen t case.
QUESTION:

You are talking about ordinary tort

You are talking about tort law.

law?

MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Aren’t you?

MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
I thought your theory was that this

man had been deprived of his liberty without due process of
law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. LARSON:

That’ scorreet.

I also believe that

the Constitution requires that the sheriff in this case
arrest only the persons who are actually wanted pursuant to
warrant.

Just because he has a warrant that says arrest

Llnnie McCollan, that doesn’t get him off the hook because
he had the information which would have corrected the
situation.

He had the fingerprints and the photographs at

QUESTION:

Mr1, Larson, are you saying that every

case of false imprisonment or false arrest at common law
tort is necessarily a constitutional violation?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Well, what is the line?

MR. LARSON:

Well, there are a lot of false arrest

cases that occur between private parties.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose a false arrest or false

imprisonment by a person acting under a color of state law.
MR. LARSON:

Well, if there is an underlying con­

stitutional requirement to effectuate liberty, yes.
QUESTION:
you.

But that is what I am trying to ask

Is every single official false arrest or false Im­

prisonment a violation of the person’s Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights?
MR. LARSON:

Yes.

I think it is helpful that If

w© — when we study this case, if m look at the law of
torts because the law of torts gives us some guidance on
how to establish these eases.

Pierson v. Ray and Monroe

both teach us that the background of tort liability is to
be used in helping to decide 1983 cases.
Now, as I understand it, he is saying that there
is no intent here.

Well, under the common law of false

imprisonment, the only intent that was required is the
intent to imprison.

Well, there certainly is the intent to

26

imprison here because the plaintiff was imprisoned.

In

addition to that, the common law in the restatement of torts
says that a warrant can be relied on to a certain point, but
the sheriff or the jailer has to use due diligence to deter­
mine whether or not the person he has arrested is the person
he actually wants.
In this case, the sheriff had the fingerprints
and photographs of the right person, but he made no effort
until several days later to compare them, and this is not
clear in the record as to how the sheriff finally came
around to it, but in the plaintiff's deposition —QUESTIONi

Don’t you have to have in the record

— don't you have to have in the record the fact that the
sheriff had this before he arrested him?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:
MR, LARSON:

But he did have them, yes, sir,
Is that in the record?
Yes.

He had the fingerprints —

That is in the record?
Yes, sir — and he had the photo­

graphs.
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:

In the record.
That’s right, it is in the record.

In fact —
QUESTION:
MR. LAR60N:

Of brother Leonard.
That’s correct.

And it would have

27
been easy for the deputies to take the pictures when they
came from Potter County down to Dallas, it would have been
easy to compare them because they don’t even look alike.
Leonard and Linnie don’t look anything alike.

In fact, I

would —
QUESTION:

That may be true in fact, but you

would have a difficult time persuading me that that is true
on the basis of this appendix.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

I understand that, but —
It is clearly different ~ these two

are clearly different.

One has glasses, the other doesn’t,

but sometimes all of us do that.
MR. LARSON:

Well, the Fifth Circuit concluded in

its opinion that there weren’t alike, that you could easily
tell it.

But in addition to that, we had the plaintiff

in the trial court telling them that he wasn’t the right
one.
QUESTION?

Now, you have described this in your

brief — and 1 am still not clear on the relevance of it —
but you have described it as a forged fictitious driver’s
license.

Now, since you have gone to that trouble to
,

l

describe it that way, what is the significance of that fact
to this case?:
MK, LARSON:

Well, Sheriff Baker's predecessor

in office took the driver’s license

away from Leonard

28
when he arrested him, his office did, and they knew it was
a phony driver’s license because they took it up, they
checked with .the Department of Public Safety and they
realized that it was a phony driver’s license, but they
made no effort to change anything.

They knew he was

operating under some wrong name and they knew that wasn’t
his driver’s license so they took it up and they had
Leonard’s picture on the driver’s license, but it was
Linnie’s driver’s license, not Leonard’s.
QUESTION:
was it?

But it wasn’t Sheriff Baker either,

That was his predecessor.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, but I am not —
And Sheriff Ba.ker is not responsible

for what his predecessor did, is he?
NR. LARSON:

No, and I haven't maintained that in

the trial of this case. Your Honor.

I did not maintain that.

I said that the duty — Sheriff Baker’s duty arose at the
time that the fingerprints and the mug shots would have
been mailed to Dallas.

I have conceded that the arrest was

justified under the circumstances, but the sheriff had to
use due diligence to determine he had the right man.

\

The-burden that someone is in jail and wants to
get out shouldn’t be placed upon the person who is in the
jail, it should be placed upon the person who is causing
him to be there, and that person is the one who should be

29
the person who has the duty to determine whether or not he
is the one that he is supposed to have, and in this case
Sheriff Baker had the fingerprints.
QUESTION:

Do you really think that is where the

burden is?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Every time a. person is in jail or

prison?
MR. LARSON:

If the person who'; Is imprisoning the

plaintiff has the fingerprints and mug shots, he is under
an obligation to eheek.
QUESTION:

Well, I misunderstood you.

I thought

you were stating that as a general proposition, that the
burden is on the custodian always as a general rule to
show the validity of the custody.
MR, LARSON:

That’s correct, he is under a duty

to constantly check his authority for the holding of —

QUESTION:

Let’s assume that most people in the

30

prisons of our country are there because they have been
convicted in criminal courts on criminal charges and
sentenced to prison, and yet you say the presumption is
against the validity of their imprisonment?
MR. LARSON:

No, sir, I am not saying that pre­

sumption is against the validity of their imprisonment, but
I am saying that the duty is upon the Jailer to constantly—
QUESTION:

To justify the imprisonment always,

the burden is on him?
Ml. LARSON:

That’s right, because the person

incarcerated doesn’t have any way to get access to the
records.

He has to rely on the jailer.

The jailer is the

one who has control.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the warden of a prison

having 5,000 inmates takes a stroll through the athletic
field and a prisoner yells, "I’m wrongfully confined, I
don’t belong here."

Does the warden have a duty thereupon

to immediately suspend whatever else he planned for the
day and go back and check the records on that particular
man?
MR. LARSON:

Not immediately, because he has

the lesion by which he can go back and check on a daily
basis.

He is not under immediate duty to do it -QUESTION:

that?

The same day he would have to check

31
MR. LARSON:

Quite frankly, Your Honor, I suspect

that almost everybody In jails think they ought not to be
there.
QUESTION:

I think so, too.

V

MR. LARSON:

But, yes, I think the Constitution

requires a jailer to know the authority for who he holds
and to be constantly checking and verifying it so that he
can determine when his person Is supposed to be released.
To place the duty on the person incarcerated would not make
any sense because he has no access to the records and he
has no access to the keys to let him out.
QUESTION:

All you are saying, as I understand

it, is that If somebody files a petition for writ of habeas
corpus, says I am being detained without lawful authority,
unless the warden can show his authority he is entitled to
get out.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
I thought the applicant, the plaintiff

had the burden of proof.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:
burden.

He does, but all he has to show ~~
But he doesn't, you say.
Yes, I did.

I agree, he has the

He only has to show that he is incarcerated and

that the reason for holding him is unjust, and that is what
he did in this case.

But then the burden switches.

32

QUESTION:

Mr. Larson, he doesn’t even have the

burden of showing it was unjust.

Pie says I am incarcerated,

nobody has a right to incarcerate me, period.

If he says

that, he gets out unless the warden comes in and shows him
why he is there.
MR." LARSON:

The plaintiff in this case estab­

lished that it wasn’t justified to hold him because the
sheriff failed in his duty to determine that he only had
the right people.
QUESTION:

I understand, but the sheriff here met

his burden Initially by saying, well, I arrest pursuant to
a warrant, out then the burden shifted back to you and you
said, yes, but you got the wrong man.
MR. LARSON:

Right, but the common law says that

you can't rely wholly on a warrant, you’ve got to use all
the information at your hands and use due diligence to be
sure you’ve got the same one.

For example, let’s suppose

we have two gentlemen named Warren Burger who were wanted
for arrest -QUESTION:

Now don’t arrest my Chief Justice.

We need him.
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

No offense intended.
That is a losing argument.

(Laughter)
MR. LARSON:

All right, I wi11 change the example

33
to John Smith.

Let's suppose we have two people named

John Smith, one x*rho had not committed a crime and one
had.

The person who is executing the warrant would be under

a duty to ascertain which John Smith he is supposed to
arrest.

Now, he may not be able to ascertain that until he

gets him to the penitentiary or to jail and checks out his
records, or he may not have any way to check at all, but
he has got to use all the information at his hands to be
sure he has got the right one.

You just can’t arrest some­

body, anybody because their name happens to be the same.
I imagine there is somewhere a warrant for Douglas Larson
somewhere, out I haven’t done anything that I know of, and
I don’t think the sheriff ought to be able to arrest me.
He has got to be sure he has got the right one.
I suspect that almost everyone has a name some­
where there is a warrant for it, whether or not he is the
one who is wanted or not.
QUESTION:

What I don't understand is you filed

a writ of habeas corpus and you say I am not the right man
nod the warden Shows the papers and says here is the in­
structions I got to put this man ir jail.

I say at that

stage, if you ‘don’t do something else, you stay in jail.

that doesn’t relieve the person who places him in jail the

You concede that it was made on prob-

MR. LARSON:

Yes.

If the Court would look at the

record, you will see that when I asked the jury, when I
submitted my motions to the jury, my question for the jury
was did the sheriff make a reasonable — did he reasonably

36
make a determination as to whether or not he had lawful
authority to hold the plaintiff.

Now, there was another

issue as to when that might have taken place.

I submit

that the United States mail would take perhaps 2H hours
for the photographs and the fingerprints to be mailed from
Potter County down to Dallas.

I arr. conceding up to that

point of time that we have no case.

fact that the plaintiff was arrested.

At what point after the arrest did

MR. LARSON:

The sheriff testified that the

standard is —
QUESTION:

Never mind what the sheriff said.

In

37
your case here, when did the arrest which you have just
conceded was made on probable cause under the warrant, when
after thatvarrest did the custody become unlawful?
MRAlARSON:

That was a jury question and we

never got it answered, Your Honor.

The question in my mind

is it is probably 24 hours or enough time to allow the
sheriff of Potter County to mail the fingerprints and the
warrant to Dallas.

Now, I assume that would take 24 hours.

It also could occur at a different time.

The sheriff said

that there was also a. duty on the deputies who left Potter
County and came to Dallas to take the fingerprints and the
mug shots with them.

They didn’t do It.

Nov;, the jury can decide which one of those times
is more reasonable.
QUESTION:

Mr. Larson, isn’t there also the

third alternative —- you don't seem to ever refer to this
—■ of when they got him back to Potter County and he vras
still protesting he was the wrong man, wasn’t there then a
duty to compare —
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
There are three-different alternatives,

as I understand your case.
MR. LARSON:

;

That’s correct.

■A

QUESTION:

Well, at least you are saying that at

some point In. time after repeated assertions that you’ve got

38
the x^ronp, man, there was some kind of a duty to look
around a little?
MR. LARSON:

Well,

I think the fact that the

plaintiff made some assertions that he wasn't the one is
helnful, but I don't think that is determinative of the
case.

I think the sheriff has a duty to be sure he has

F,ot the rip;ht one and to exercise due diligence to deter­
mine whether or not he has the rip;ht one.
QUESTION:

At some point he determined that he

did not have the rip;ht one.
MR. LARSON:

That's riyht.

It Is probably be­

cause the bail bondsman went up and saw the plaintiff in
jail and said that is not the man and went down and told
the sheriff.

However, the record is not clear on that.

QUESTION:

Does the record show exactly what

was said by the respondent when he ai rived at the jail?
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:
a mistake."

Yes, sir.
What did he say?
He said ’'I'm not the one, there Is

In fact, he —

QUESTION:
MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

Did he offer any explanation?
He didn't have any.

He didn't know.

At this starve, he didn't know It was

his brother that you wanted.
MR. LARSON:

He didn't know whether it was his

brother or not.

I guess he might have assumed that his

brother had done something and he was being arrested for
it, but he didn't know.

He just throughout the entire

course of this litigation maintained that he had no
knowledge of what his brother was doing or not doing in
Potter County.
To my’way of thinking, the more interesting
issue or the more sexy issue — if you will nardon the
exnression — in this case is whether or not the sheriff
is entitled to the defense of good faith.
Well, in this case we have a sheriff who didn't
do anything.

In fact, he is saying that I have got a

right to be a fool and I've got a right to be a full and
I don't have any professional or statutory or constitu­
tional responsibilities to be sure I've got the right man
in jail.
QUESTION:

Is that issue here, Mr. Larson?

I

thought the Court of Anneals said that it could be sub­
mitted to the jury unon retrial afterwards, and you haven't
cross-petitioned.
m. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That's true.
Then why, sexy as It may be, is it

here?
MR. LARSON:

I think the issues that the pe­

titioner framed here cover that issue.

QUESTION:

Well, you are not obliged to follow

him if he is in error.
MR. LARSON:

I ap;ree.

But be that as it may, I

still don’t believe that the sheriff is entitled to a de­
fense of p;God faith here.

I think yood faith arm lies to a

false arrest case like the one in Pierson v. Ray, where
the arresting officer has a rip;ht to rely on what he be­
lieves the law to be.

But in this situation, I think the

sheriff's duty is clear.

He has a duty to incarcerate only

those persons which he has the lawful authority to do so.
QUESTION:

Mr. Larson, xrould it be correct if

the issue really is whether there is a constitutional
violation, a deprivation of liberty without due process of
law, are you in effect arp;uinp; that the constitutional re­
quirement of due process requires that when a man is
arrested and protests his innocence and all the rest,
there is nart of the procedure that the police must follow
is to check reliable sources to identify him?
MR.

LARSON:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So the constitutional violation was

the failure to accord due process wnich means a failure to
check this man’s identity when it was appropriate to do so?
MR.

LARSON:

QUESTION:

That's c orre 31.
So we don’t have to look at ne^ll^ence

or p,ood faith or any of this stuff, do we?

MR. LARSON:
QUESTION:

That is my position.
What do you do with the bench warrant

that is authorized to nick u.n John C. Doe immediately, it
commands, I think is the word.
MR. LARSON:

All warrants command, I believe

that is correct.
QUESTION:

Well, what discretion does the sherif

have then?
MR. LARSON:

Well, I trust that he would do some­

thing to try to narrow down which John Doe —

Mr. Sorelle.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. W. SORELLE III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIDNER — REBUTTAL
MR. SORELLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it nlease

the Court:
The respondent's position boils down to this,
that the due process clause now has a new recopmized federal

right and that being that if a man has been previously
arrested, no warrant for that man may be exercised without
using fingerprints and photographs to identify the subse­
quent man.
QUESTION;
saying that.

I didn't understand Mr* Larson to be

I thought he conceded the validity of the

original arrest.
MR. SORELLE:

He conceded the initial arrest, but

he suggests that as a matter of due process that reasonable­
ness of identity must include using fingerprints and photo­
graphs under these circumstances.
QUESTION:

Not for the original arrest, as I

understood Mr. Larson.
MR. SORELLE:

Your Honor,

I submit that due pro­

cess then should not require that at any stage in these
proceedings during this period of time simply because if
the respondent in this case is going to demonstrate an
unreasonable method of identification, then he should have
approached it by showing that the method used was unreason­
able and not suggesting that the corrective action in­
stituted by the sheriff should have been used.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sorelle, one of the complaints

is that if the sheriff hadn't been out celebrating New
Year's Eve, the man would have been turned loose right
away.

47
MR. SORELLE:

No, sir, I don't think that was

suggested.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t the record show that as

soon as the sheriff was made aware of the facts, he turned
the man loose?
MR. SORELLE:

Absolutely.

And it is our position

that this is one of the reasons why the sheriff in this
case should not have been held liable under —
QUESTION:

He could have come in during the

holiday and taken a look at his job.
MR. SORELLE:

contact with one of his deputies who obviously failed to
advise him —
QUESTION:

Well, I would say the more contact

you give him with the Jail, the more trouble he will get
in.
MR. SORELLE:

Certainly, but he. had no notice

that this man was arrested and we are talking here, ac­
cording to respondent, about intentional tort that he in­
tended to arrest, this man and —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sorelle, we are not really talk­

ing about the arrest any more.
MR. SORELLE:

weekend had been in Mexico for two weeks, presumably the
man would have stayed in jail for two weeks until the
sheriff got back and you would have precisely the same
argument.

As soon as he found out, he let him out.
MR. SORELLE:

No, sir.

The only noint I am

making —
QUESTION:

Well, what is the difference between

three days and thirteen days?
MR. SORELLE:

The point Is that at some nlace in

here, this is a personal action against Sheriff Baker,
somewhere in here there should be a showing that the sheriff
made -QUESTION:

And he did make adequate procedures

for Identifying people who had beenHafriested-.
MR. SORELLE:

....

____

Acted erroneously, yes, sir.

But

it is my position that the procedures to examine should be
the procedures used and not the procedures not used if we
are going to treat it as a tort.
QUESTION:

That’s right, in those procedures if

the sheriff had been gone for three weeks, under those
procedures this man would have stayed In jail for three
weeks.
FIR. SORELLE:

I don't believe so.

I think the

evidence also shows that on coming oack they would have

also routinely processed the new photographs and I.D.
made at the time of the arrest.
QUESTION:

Well, why didn’t they do it when they

picked him up and brought him to —
MR. SORELLE:

The only testimony was that the

I.D. man was not on duty during that period himself.

It

was a matter that they were apparently short-handed and
didn't have a man on duty during that weekend, and I believe
that is the answer.

Our position is that there were pro­

cedures, they in fact worked in this case, the problem
being that tligre was a short delay.
QUESTION:

The Court of Anpeals simply said the

case had to go back for a jury verdict, didn’t it?
MR. SORELLE:

The Court of Anneals — yes, sir,

they fir.. .'My. determined that it should go tack to determine
whether the sheriff was unreasonable in failing to have
previously instituted this policy.
QUESTION:

And that was to be determined by the

jury or judge as a matter of question of fact?
MR. SORELLE:

That would be a question of facty

and it was our position, of course, that this is a nure
negligence issue, and if this Court affirmed that holding,
that it would be extending 1933 to simple negligence acts.
QUESTION:

So under the Court of Appeals holding,

the procedures used by the sheriff would be a question of

50
fact to the jury in every case as to whether they conform
to the Constitution.
MR. SORELLE:

Yes, sir, so that in any allegation

if a man was arrested, confined, later determined that he
should not have been confined, whether by jury or not, pre­
sumably he would have a cause of action against the jailer
to determine whether the jailer should have had investigated
and determined earlier that he was the wrong man.

I submit,

Your Honors, that in this case had Sheriff Baker — he
would have been better off had he done nothing, taken this
respondent before the magistrate, had him bound over for
trial and ignored the changes of his procedure, then it
would have been left up to the jury to determine his in­
nocence because Sheriff Baker acted affirmatively to de­
termine that this was the wrong man and released him and
then acted affirmatively to investigate and determine a
better procedure by his own good-faith acts created the
sole evidence on which the Fifth Circuit determined to
submit a cause to the jury.
The trial court considered that there was no
violation of due process and directed a verdict.

The

Fifth Circuit I believe erroneously placed it in context
with Whirl v. Kern.
Thank you.
