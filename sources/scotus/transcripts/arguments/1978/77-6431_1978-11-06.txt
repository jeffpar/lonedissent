ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. UJLK* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, SILK:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
This appeal brings to this Court for review a judg­
ment of the New York Court of Appeals,

The New York Court of

Appeals* by dismissing an appeal from the Appellate Division of
the Court* from an order of the Surrogates Court in New York*
in effect* affirmed a judgment of the lower court which termin­
ated the parentage of Appellant to two children whom he had
sired* whom he had raised* whom he had cared for* whom he had
lived with* whom he had supported for more than half their
lives.

And did so without any proof of unfitness* did so with­

out any particularized findings of unfitness* did so in total
disregard of his parental rights as a father and effectively
broke and smashed up his family relationship with these two
children* whom at the time the adoption petitions were filed
he had been supporting* he had been .caring for* he had bought
a house for* they had lived with him and whom he was fighting
for their custody in another court.

4
They broke up fche relationship of this man with his
children without any finding that he did not have a familyrelationship with them# as is required in Quliloln v» Walcott#
without any finding# without any proof at all that he was a
bad father»

They broke up his relationship with his children

and# in effect# replaced him.

took them away from him# In

effect# and replaced him with a stepfather and with a stranger
upon this sols ground that he was of the male sex and not the
female sex# and that being of the male sex# he was not married
to the parent of the female sex,
QUESTION:

Who was this stepfather# again?

MR» SILK: The stepfather was fche husband of the
mother»
QUESTION:

That's of some significance# isn't it?

MR» SI1K:

I think that it is only perhaps of some

significance if we at first dispose of fche rights and inter»
asfcs of fche father# himself -- of the natural father who had
been raising the child»
QUESTION:

Noiv# if these children were going to be

adopted into either family# that is# fche new family# that is
that of the natural father and his new wife# or that of fche
natural mother and her new husband# if there was going to be
any adoption at all as between those# the rights of one of
the natural parents were going to be terminated in the drastic
and dramatic way you have just described# isn't that correct?

5
MR0 3 ILK:

I would have to agree with Your Honor

that that Is what would have happened In the event of an
adoption by either side,
QUESTION:

The rights of one of the natural parents

are going to be terminated in just the complete and dramatic
way you have described# isn't that correct?
MRa &ILK:

There is no question about that at all,

QUESTION:

Am I correct in understanding that the

logical consequence of your argument would be that the only
fair and# indeed# the only constitutional thing to do in a
situation such as this one# is not to have any adoption at all?
MRo SILK:

That is precisely what my argument is.

I do not see how the father could take the child away from the
mother to the point where his wife would become the adoptive
mother of the child and the original mother would be left out
in the cold# and I make no claim of that sort,
QUESTION:

If the adoptive father had succeeded# did

succeed ultimately# the child would acquire another source of
support# would it not? Legally.enforceable source of support,
MR, SILK:

The child already had another source of

support# under the New York law, because, under the New York
law a stepfather is also made responsible for the support of
his child, whether or not that child is adopted by the stepfather.

But what the adoption would do, and did do, was to

terminate the obligation of Appellant to support his child and

6
Appellant did have an obligation to support hi® child prior to
the adoption# even though the child was born out of wedlock0
do what the adoption did was to replace the natural father with
the stepfather# to no advantage to the child except to destroy
the child8® relationship to his natural parent -- to their
natural parent.

There were two children.

QUESTION:

How does.it destroy that relationship?

The court may place the custody wherever it is deemed best for
the welfare of the child or children#may it not?
MR. SILK:

That is right# but this was not a custody

QUESTION;

But they do have the power?

MR. SILK:

They must place the child# in terms of

the child to have the custody# but that does not cause the
termination of parental rights.
custodial parent.

The child still sees the non­

The noncustodial parent still retains ob­

ligations to take care of the child.

The noncustodial parent

QUESTION; . Is that foreclosed if the child is

MR. SILK;
custody.

The adoption has a different effect from

The adoption not only -«*
QUESTION:

My question is:

Does it foreclose?

7
MR* SILK:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Do you mean the court doesn't have the

power to permit visitation rights for the natural father?

MR. UXDK:

It does not.

The adoption completely

drops a blank wall between natural parent and child.
pletely

Com­

totally drops a blank wall, and the only way a child

can ever see his father is if the adoptive parent permits the
child to do so.

Because under the New York adoption law, the

child has now a new set of parents, and his name is changed.
Their names are placed on his birth certificate.

In this case,

it just means placing the name of the mother on the ■»-- of the
adoptive father on the birth certificate.
of name.

It means a change of identity.

It means the change
It means a total

change for the child, so that the child's relationships with
parental people are destabilized and instead of continuing on
with a continuing course of a family relationship which the
child has had with its natural parent, the child suddenly finds
that a natural parent appears-to the child to have rejected
the child.

And the child in this case will never know how long;

and how hard his father has fought to maintain his relation­
ship with him.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, Counsel, that these

children had had a very stable relationship before the adoption
proceeding?
MR. iSILK:

Yes, there is no question but that these

8
children had a stable relationship with their father and I
would think probably with their mother* before the adoption
proceedings took place»
QUESTION:

Would you think it was something New York

was constitutionally required to* say* meet the minimum stan­
dards for raising of children?
MR» SILK:

I don't quite understand —

QUESTION:

The shifting back and forth and the

tensions that obviously existed»

Didn't your client take the

children back at one time and didn't your opponent's client
take the children at one time?
MR» &I1UK:

Yes* my client took his own children back

from Puerto Rico* whence they had been sent by the Appellees
and where they had remained for some 14 months with their
grandmother»

He brought them back to New York.

them into his home»

He brought

He provided them with a home»

vided them with support.

He pro­

He provided than with a family and

he took care of them and wanted to continue to take care of
/

them* and made every effort to do so, until he was compelled
by a temporary interim

order of the Family Court* which was

made only prior to a hearing and prior to a determination of
the merits to turn the children over to the mother on a
temporary basis* but reserved the rights of visitation to
himself»
QUESTION:

It sounds to me like your argument is

9
kind of like a joint tenancy one, that on divorce the husband
gets a half right in the children and the wife gets a half
right in the children,

I think New York's approach here is

that neither parent, necessarily, has any compelling interest
in the child, that it is the children's welfare,,
MR, SILK:

Well, actually, that may be New York's

interest, if that's what New York sayss and I don't believe
that it is quite what New York says.

New York says, under

Section 70 of the Domestic Relations law that there shall be
no prima facia right to custody of a child, but custody shall
always be determined in the best Interest of a child.
But, again, I want to emphasize that this is not a
custody case.

This is a termination of all parental rights.

This is a breaking up of a family case.

This is a breaking

up of a family and this is a substitution for a natural father
of an adoptive father,
QUESTION:

But the family broke up when the natural

mother and natural father separated, didn't it, for all
practical purposes?
MR, SILK:

Not the family, between the children and

their respective parents,

with

QUESTION:

But that's two different families,

MR, SILK:

Well, the family that we are concerned

here is the family of the children, and the family of

the parents,

And while the parents may separate

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Silk* this is a strange family* when

the husband and wife live In separate residences in New York
and the children are living in Puerto Rico.

That is not a

normal family»
MR. SILK:

That Is the situation that was created

by the mother.
QUESTION:

That is not a normal family* is it?

MR. SILK:

No* it wasn't* and my client did every­

thing he could to make It a normal family* by bringing the
children back from Puerto Rico.

And when the children came

back from Puerto Rico* the matter went into the -QUESTION:

It still wasn't a no.mal family.

MR. SILK:

Well, once the children came back from

Puerto Rico* it was as normal as families of

as divorced

families by the millions are when they have children.

It was

a family In which the child custody -QUESTION:

Maybe 1 object to your saying that a

divorced family is a normal family.
MR. SILK:

Maybe it is more normal than we think*

I am afraid* because — I agree with Your Honor that it Is not
anything to be looked for* but there are* on the other hand*
millions of divorced families in this country and they have
managed* sometimes through the aid of family courts* to work
out custody problems and visitation problems and support
problems* so that the children are not shuttled back and forth.

11

New York has a strong policy against shuttling.
QUESTION:

I think we all know that.

Why not get to

MR. SILK:

Your Honor, what happened in this particu­

this case?

lar case is that the trial judge made a determination and he
made a determination in his opinion and it has been upheld
through all the New York courts.
QUESTION:

That opinion was that the best interests

of the child called for their being with the mother and that
this adoption should proceed.
MR. SILK:

That was part of it, but part of his

opinion was that my client had no right to object to an
adoption, that that was not a legal necessity.

The prime

objective — and Your Honor is quite right and, if I may read
the opinion, at page 20A df the Appendix:

"The prime objective

of allowing a putative father to be heard is therefore not to
determine the degree of his continued Interest in the child,
but rather to determine the best interest of the child."
That is what the trial judge said.

Now, what the

trial judge did there was to apply the wrong legal test, be­
cause in a situation where you have a temination of parental
rights, state power cannot be trusted to determine that the
best interest of the child requires the replacement of his
natural fit father with a stranger and a breaking up of the
child’s natural family ties with his natural father, without

12

proof of unfitness,
QUESTION;

Aren't you reading the word "prime" as if

it were "only" In that sentence?
foremost.

Prime simply means the

It doesn't mean the only* does it?
MR, SILK;

It might be, but in this case the judge

was saying that it was the prime objective, but he had nc
other objective whatsoever to show.

And he did say that a

putative father's consent to such an adoption is not a legal
necessity, on page 27 of the Appendix,
So, it is quite clear that, although he used the
word —
QUESTION;
isn't It?

That's what the statute clearly provides,

He was accurate in that statement, insofar as he

was reciting the law of New York, wasn't he?
MR. SILK;

He certainly was.

He was truly following

the New York statute,/ and that's why this case is coming here
by appeal and not by certiorari,
QUESTION;

Do you contend that the putative father,

constitutionally, has an absolute right to veto an adoption like
this?
MR. SILK;

The putative father «— No, I would not

want to call him a putative father.

child.

QUESTION:

Well,the natural father®

MR, SILK:

He is the real, natural father of this

And he is the father who has raised and supported this

13

child for more than half of the child's life and who was doing
so at the time the adoption petitions were filed.
fit and he was concerned.
QUESTION:

And he ivas

I would say he did have a right.

But are you saying that all natural

fathers have that right* or just your client* under these
particular circumstances?
MR. SILK:
perform

I am saying all natural fathers ivho

as did my client.

And I am saying that all natural

fathers have that right who had a relationship with his child.
Now* the relationship with the child is a missing factor that
was missing in Quilloin v. Walcott.

In that case* this Court

recently considered the constitutionality of almost an iden­
tical statute fiom the state of Georg3.a.

And in that case*

the Court looked very carefully at the relations that the
father had with the child to find out whether the father had
a protected interest with the child.

And the Court* looking

at these relations* found that they were skimpy and scanty*
indeed.

And I would have to agree that Quilloin v. Walcott

lays down the law* and that is that a father who had only
sired but not raised the child and has played no role in
raising the child* he lias not a constitutionally protected
interest under Stanley v, Illinois.
Now* Stanley v. Illinois referred to a situation
in which Stanley’s family was being dismembered If the
Illinois law were applied* in which Stanley’s children whom he

14

had sired and raised were being taken away from him, if the
Illinois law applied, without any proof of his unfitness.

rights of the natural father vis-a-vis the custody rights
of the state,institutionalizing them under the aegis of the
state.

Am I wrong in my recollection?
MR. SILK:

Well, I believe that it was a little

more than that, because I believe that the child was being
treated as someone who could be taken by the state, made a
ward of the State of Illinois, placed for adoption, and that
the father's rights were, in effect, being terminated by the
proceedings that were taking place.
QUESTION:

You would agree with that?

QUESTION:

That Is also correct, isn't it?

Relying on my

15

recollection»
MR» SILK;

I do not see how it can be justifiably

maintained that a father's relationship with his children is
any less valuable and important than a mother's relationship
with a child»
QUESTION:

The point is in Stanley you didn't have

a competition between the two because the mother was dead»
MR» SILK:

Yes, that is true, but the net effect, as

far as the father was concerned and the father's relationship
with his children in Stanley v. Illinois and in the present
case is precisely the same.
QUESTION:

But the competition in Stanley was, first

of all, not for adoption at all, at least at that stage,
simply for custody, a net secondly, between the natural father
who had not only sired but raised the children, on the one
hand, and the state on the other.
MR. SIUC:

That's correct, isn't it?

Yes, that is absolutely correct, Your

Honor»
Insofar as the protectable interest of the father
is concerned in his child, however, the effect of the two is
exactly the same,,

Because in both Stanley v. Illinois and in

this case,at stake was dismemberment of the father's family.
At stake in Qullloin v. Walcott the father did not have a
family with the children.

In Stanley v. Illinois, the

father had a good family with the children»

He had raised

16

them and supported them and he had lived with them and they
had lived with him.
In the present case which we have now before the
Courts we have precisely the same situation.
Walcotts we did not have that situation.

In Qullloln v.

In Quilloin v.

Walcottt you had a situation in which the father's relation­
ship with the child was wispy at best* and in which the child's
relationship with the proposed adoptive stepfather was a
thousand times stronger.

He had lived in the same home with

the adoptive proposed stepfather — I mean with the stepfather
who was the proposed adopting father.

He had lived in the

same home for seven years.
QUESTION;

May I interrupt you for a minute?

I

missed something in the statute somewhere* because you are
talking a great deal about the relationship of the father to
the child.

Does the statute say anything about that?
MR. SIXK:

No.

QUESTION;

What would the situation under this

statute be if neither parent had any relationship with the
child at the time?

Suppose they both deserted the child and

it turned out that somebody wanted to come along and adopt*
wouldn't the mother have a veto right under the New York
statute* even though she hadn't seen the child for 10 years?
MR. SILK:

If it had been found that the mother had

abandoned the child, then the mother would have no right under

17

the New York statute.
QUESTION:

Does the statute say that?

MR.

Yes* I think it does.

I lit:

But anything less

than abandonment* any skimpy kind of a relationship which
might in New York not constitute abandonment* the skimpy kind
of relationship that Mr. Qullloin had with his child» if the
mother had that sort of relationship with the child in New York*
that would not* under New York law* constitute abandonment.
QUESTION:

In this case* relationship is really im­

material* except as sort of background* isn't it?

Neither of

these parents had abandoned the child.
MR0 ailiC:

I see the relationship* In this case* to

be the protected interest.

The constitutionally protected

interest is the right of a parent to raise* to rear* to have
the company and companionship of his child.

It Is a relation­

ship which is based upon the history and upon the facts of this
case and it is a relationship which is protected for the
mother in this case* and it is not protected for the father.
QUESTION:

If you prevail here* how will these

rights that you claim be protected?
hoxv often he can see the child?
I suppose®

Who is going to decide

The Domestic Relations judge*

Is that right?
MR® SILK:

Yes.

Insofar as custody and insofar as

visitation is concerned* we are not asking this Court to make
any deterainafcion

18

QUESTION:

I am asking you. the consequence if you

prevail here»
MR» SILK:

The consequences if we prevail here ’would

be that the matter would go back to the Family Court and
custody would be determined and visitation would be determined
and support would be determined, in the best interests of the
child, and in equity and fairness to all parties»

all.

QUESTION:

Provided custody would necessarily result

MR» SILK:

No, It would not necessarily result at

If the Family Court took the case over, the Family Court

would have full power, after a hearing and after a trial, to
turn over custody to the mother, with rights of visitation to
the father,

It would have power to turn over right of

custody to the father, with rights of visitation to the mother.
It would have a right to mold whatever remedy that it feels
proper, in the best interest of the child.
QUESTION:

Just like in divorce cases.

MR. SILK:

Yes, it v/ould be exactly like divorce

QUESTION:

But it is true, Mr. Silk, isn't it — and

cases.

I think perhaps I am repeating the question I asked at the
outset — that if you.are correct, it would follow that at
least in the situation that you allege this situation to be,
that the Constitution of the United States would absolutely

19

prohibit and prevent the possibility of any adoption of these
children* by anybody?
MR. SILK;

la that correct?
It would prevent the adoption* unless

the parents agree that the children should be adopted,,

If

there is no reason —
QUESTION:

But If you are correct in your consti­

tutional claim* wouldn't it follow that the Constitution of
the United States would prevent the adoption of thttse children
by anybody so long as you and your opponents remain in a liti­
gating posture?

Now* If you decide you want to settle it and

one or the other decides not to litigate* of course* the case
would change.

Doesn't that follow* necessarily?

MR» SXIK:

Adoption which would cause the replace­

ment of a parent —
QUESTION:

That’s what an adoption* you have told

us* Inevitably does.
MR. SILK:

/
Well* a parent might consent to it and

the other parent might consent to the adoption by the other
one.

In other words —
QUESTION:

Look* if you people had agreed on this

matter* this wouldn't ever have been a lawsuit and this case
wouldn't be here.

I am assuming that you are going to be

litigating It* and that you are not going to change your
position and that your adversaries are not either.
QUESTION:

That's where New York leaves divorced

20

parents* isn't it?
MR® SILK;

That's exactly where New York leaves

divorced parents®
QUESTION:

Where either parent can vefco*abs@nt

some finding of unfitness.
MR. SILK:

Well* either parent -- If the parents

are divorced* the situation would be the same as it would be
here* If I should prevail in this case* yes.

That is* if

divorced parents treated their children as my client treated
his children* then they could not be replaced by adoptive

QUESTION:

Divorced parents* as long as they

haven't been found to be unfit* each of them* under New York
law* can prevent the adoption?
MR. SILK:

Oh* yes.

Without any question whatso­

QUESTION:

But either one of them can control the

ever,

custody by exercise of any kind of a veto?
MR. SILK:

If there is a dispute over custody*

that will be decided in the best interest of the child.
QUESTION:

The court decides it.

QUESTION:

With visitation rights.

MR. SILK:

With visitation rights* with parental

rights preserved.
QUESTION:

If the .judge thinks visitation rights are

21

good for the child.
MR* SILK:

Visitation rights are almost invariably

granted to one extent or another extent in New York, depending
upon the facts.

Sometimes restricted visitation is allowed*

but always some visitation is allowed* under the worst of
circumstances* so that the children will continue to know
their roots and continue to have a relationship with their
natural parent.

And the natural parent will continue to feel

that that parent has an offspring and a child that that parent
would be able to come and see and to protect and to support
and care for as best as that parent could.
Now* in this particular case* we have a line drawn
on the basis of sex.

This line is drawn on the basis of sex

to the point where it serves absolutely no purpose.

It treats

a mother's relationship with her child in a constitutionally
protected sense.

The mother* after all, was unmarried to the

father, as much as the father was unmarried to the mother.

The

mother entered this relationship fully aware that the father
had a prior undlssolved relationship which prevented marriage
and yet she was willing to do it.

She took the father's name

and she bore two children for the father, and the father and
she together lived in a common home and brought these children
up.

Under New York law, this has given the mother a protected

relationship with the children and it has given the father
absolutely no protection whatsoever.

22

In Stanley v. Illinois, and in all of the cases which
Stanley v. Illinois has cited, both parents have very important
protected Interests in maintaining their relationships with
their children»

It is cardinal with this Court and it is

cardinal with us, as stated in Prince v. Massachusetts, that
the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in
the parents whose primary function and freedom include prepara­
tion for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder,
and it is in recognition of this that these decisions have
respected the private realm of family life which the state
cannot enter»

But Prince was a case where the mother

and father were both united against the state.

They were united in opposing an intrusion of the

That isn't the case here

23

In Qullloln v. Walcott* we had very similar sifcuafclor*
in that the mother was married to the proposed adoptive father
and the natural father was trying to prevent the adoption.
This Court had this issue before it at that time* except that
it had it in a different factual context.

In the opinion of

Mr. Justice Marshall for this unanimous Court* the opinion
specifically limited itself to the situation before the Court.
And the opinion in Quilloin did not say that because it
happened to be the mother and her husband who were trying to
adopt* It said that because the natural father did not have a
relationship to his child* which was constitutionally protected.
QUESTION:

What would be your view if you had an

infant* two or three weeks old

or two or three months old*

just old enough to be put out for adoption.

Would you take

the view then -- So that no permanent relationship really could
have formed yet between the natural father and the infant.
In that context* would you say the natural father has an absol­
ute veto as a matter of constitutional right?
MR. SILK:

I would say that the natural father* if

he had played a role* even as brief as it possibly could have
been* a parental role* a parental relationship.
QUESTION:

MR, SILK:

He was barely able*, although he tried, to

establish sane sort of connection with the child and showed
concern -QUESTION:

He just doesn't want the adoption to be

placed with that particular person.
MR, LILK:

Yes, I would say that he did, because he

had an Interest in that child which was as young and as new as
the child was itself.

And he couldn't possibly have established

a stronger relationship than he did, and he tried.

And if he

made the effort, then I think that the child was lucky to have
a concerned father who wanted to look after the child's inter­
ests .

My answer is yes.

Again, depending on the

facts of that particular relationship.
QUESTION:

Mr. Silk, may I ask you a somewhat re­

lated question?. Would you be satisfied if the New York law
were amended to provide equal rights for both the mother and
the fatherland the rights essentially said that neither had
an absolute right to veto an adoption, each would be entitled
to a hearing and the decision would turn on what was found to
be in tie best Interest of the child?
MR. Llllt: , No, I would not.

It would not meet my due process issue»

And the due

I understood that my brother,

Powell's question was that the two parties together go into

MR. SILK:

The state in this particular case has

entered it, of course, through its courts and through its laws,

And, although the parties have individually invoked the assis­

of the Constitution of the United States, we are still facing

And I say that a law which provides for such dis­
crimination of this type in this case is obsolete, that it
bears no relationship to a substantive purpose which a state
has any right to defend, which has any right to promote.

It

is not in the interest of the state to promote the adoption
of children by their mothers and not by their fathers.
Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUfcJTICE BURGER;

Mr. Schulslaper.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP MQRRIE SC HUL3 LA PER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SCHULSLA PER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If Mr. Caban appeared before the Surrogate Court of
Kings County as he is portrayed today, in the adversary positicn
compelled by Section 111 of the Domestic Relations Law, auto­
matically because the first principle is the best interest of
the child, neither the interest of the father, putative or
real, or the interest of the mother, but the interest of the

27

child, then it is very possible that the Surrogate would have
refused to allow this adoption»
If he were able to establish the substantiality that
he projects now before the Court, that could have happened»
If he were able to establish this to the satisfaction of the
Appellate Division of the Second Department, there is little
question in my mind that that department would not have held
unanimously against Mr, Caban.

But under the authority of

Gerald J, J„, and I believe the citation is 61 AD2-521, li~
could have reversed the Surrogate.

It could have denied this

adoption* not because the interests of a father were there in­
volved but because the interests of the child were there in­
volved,

And because in Gerald, on an adversary position, they

found that the father was involved, a fruitful worker, con­
cerned, he traveled from California, he sent cards, he sent
gifts, that the adoptive parent was not quite equal to those
circumstances,
QUESTION:

Are you telling us that the New York

definition of the best interest of the child may include the
concern of the natural father?
MR, SCHULSLAPDR:

They include all facets, all facets,

any triable issue, any factor which the* court, as a fact, can
find would be injurious to the child.

It is not a shnple

statement of the mother.
QUESTION:

In other words, you are telling us that

28

there is not just an automatic veto.
MR. SCHUI^jLAPER:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

The

instant you produce the standard, the best Interest of the
child, Mr. Caban had the right »•» and he was granted the right
to be heard fully,

Mrs. Maria Mohammed was required to estab­

lish that that adoption was in the best interest of the two
children.

But, as he is portrayed today, he was not portrayed

before the Surrogate of Kings County, Your Honor,

The Mr. Caban

who appears today
QUESTION:

Counsel, before you go into the facts, let

me just question one statement you made,
)

Supposing he had tried to adopt with his new wife
and the court had been persuaded that it would have bean in
the best interest of the child to allow that adoption.

Just

assume that, even though 1 know this case, in your view, is
different.

It would, nevertheless, be true, would it not, that

the wife had an absolute veto over such an adoption?
MR, SCHUUJLAPfiR:

The use of the word "veto" troubles

me, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

Well, an unqualified right to prevent the

adoption from taking place.
MR, SCHULSLAPER:
adoption?

Could she have prevented the

The answer is yes, she could have prevented the

adoption, unless the facts were produced to persuade the court
that she was totally, her presence, her custody was inimical

29

to the best interest of the child# that she had either
abandoned him or# for whatever reason produced before the
court on evidence on an adversary circumstance# she should not
have the right to continue custody and parenthood of that
childo
QUESTION:

That would be only under the statute# if

one of the dispensing,- conditions of Section 6 applied# so it
would be a two-step process.
MR. ECHULSLAPER:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

The first step would b® that one of the

dispensing conditions was present.
MR. SCHUI^LAPER:

Exactly.

Under those circumstances#

or her circumstance because she has the right# or you require
her consent# there is little question that you would have to
produce strong evidence.

And there is little question that

under these circumstances the state# whether it was the State
of Georgia under Qullloln or the State of New York# has the
right to accept what Mr. Justice'Burger said in his dissenting
opinion in Stanley v. Illinois.
QUESTION:

That won't help you very much# Counsel#

that was a dissenting opinion.
MR. SCHUiSLAPER:

I quite understand it wag a dis­

senting opinion# Your Honor# but I point out# as Mr. Justice
Marshall pointed out# that this was not an adoption proceeding.
This was not a circumstance between father and mother# whether

30

they were putative or real.

This was an action against the

state in the presence of a living^viable* concerned mother.
Under those cireurnstances* your dissenting opinion holds very*
very strongly in favor of Mrs, Mohammed,
The fact is that historically we have accepted that
the mother is the more dependable person* and certainly
against the putative father who has had the opportunity* and
certainly in this case has had the opportunity to look for a
divorce to sanctify the relationship that he now holds so dear
before this Court,

The same man who found it most convenient*

on the facts* to very expeditiously obtain a divorce after*
after this woman was married.

This woman did no more in that

relationship —
QUESTION:

How important are these facts to this

statute which we are talking about?

Isn't it true that if this

man* this very Petitioner, in this case

Appellant* rather --

was the highest pillar In his church and who loved

the only

thing he loved more than children were his own children*

and

he spent 99% of his money on his children* still this statute
would apply to him* wouldn't it?
MR, iSCHULSLAPJSR:
QUESTION:

.That is correct* Your Honor,

So* what is the difference In this case?

We are talking about this statute, •
MR, SCHUISLA PER:

That is correct* Your Honor,

However* while I don't want to go into the facts --

31

I've exposed them in my brief—certain ■ factors have come up
in the Appellant's reply brief, and certain declarations were
made here* and I believe that it is essential for this Court's
consideration to point out several factors 0
He claims that he had custody of these two children
for two months before the adoption.

The circumstances of ' his

so-called custody should be known to the Court.

I am aware

that the Court realizes that he traveled to Puerto Rico and
brought the children back under the guise of parenthood.
never had it.

He

The closest he came to an acknowledgement of

parenthood was that after three months time* at the insistence
)

of Mrs. Mohammed* he allowed his name -- or he allow©?? the
Board of Health to record him as the father on the birth

certificate.
QUESTION:

Do I understand* Counsel* you are now

denying paternity here?
MR. SCHUISLAPER:

I am not.

I am trying to point

out that this man's interest was not of the great depth that
he now describes.
QUESTION:

A little while ago* you used the word

"putative" father.
MR. SCHULSLAPER:
QUESTION:
.

Yes.

Reputed.

The reputed father.

You said "putative."

MR. SCHUISLAPER:

That is correct* Your Honor* as I

understand it* the word* by definition* is reputed.

32

QUESTION:

Counsel* if we could get away from the

facts of this case for a particular moment* what do you say -What is the justification for a rule that treats the mother's
power in an attempt by the father to — the natural father —
to adopt differently from the father's right to object to
the mother's attempt to adopt?
MR, SCHULZLA PER:

This Court has so held in Qullloin

v„ Walcott that the father had less veto power*, that Georgia
had the power to give less veto power -- to use that word -to the putative father* Leon Quilloln* than it was required to
give to a father who had been once married and perhaps divorced,
QUESTION:

Which opinion are you quoting now?

MR, cCHULSLAPER:
This Court specifically said

That would be Quilloin v. Walcott,
as long as it was interested

in the child's best interests* then it had the right to give
less veto to the reputed or the putative father* the unmarried
father or the natural father* if you will.
The State of New York has that same right in the
best Interest of the child.

The problem now simply is:

Is

this a presumption?. The fact is it is not an irrebuttable
presumption* that this man* Caban* had the right to walk into
court and over 447 pages* 375 of which are testimony* he had
the right to rebut the presumption of the statute if it be so
held as a presumption.
This was not concluded against him.

He was simply

33
not wiped out of the position*

He had the right to be heard*

And as New York dtate applies it, where the right was sub­
stantiated, where his position was substantiated -- or -~
forgive me — where the father was found to be of substantial
interest, the courts did not allow that adoption against the
putative father to go forth*

The State has that right.

Now, this Court could interfere if it found a
presumption under Stanley*

It cannot interfere on the basis

of Quiiloin, unless these facts -- and the only reason I can
think of, the case being before this Court,-is the challenge
to the circumstance by my adversary that there was substance
|

to his relationship*

The record was before the Appellate

Division, as I said, before the Court of Appeals, the very
same justices who dissented in the case of Malpica-Qralnl,
here known as Oraini-Biossi, joined the majority*

QUESTION:

They joined

That might have been because they thought

that despite their previous dissent the law of New York was
not established.
MR* *5 C HU .Us LA P„GR:

That might very well have been,

and it might just as well have been on this record, Your Honor*
I have no way of knowing that*

But on this record there was

•no substance, and the record so shows it*
Now, he claims that he purchased a house and that,
as a result of that, fighting the case before this Court and

34
others, he has been rendered -- he has impoverished himself.
He claims that he was a married man at the time that he made
application for adoption in reverse from the putative mother.
Well, it is important that this Court know the facts.

He took

the children back to the City of New York by chicanery, using
his own parents to persuade the maternal grandmother, who had
lawful custody for good and valuable reason, to bring them to
their home.

His visitation rights were never interfered with,

nor were his visitations interfered with here.

When he notified

.Puerto Rico that he was going to go down there, the kids were
made available to him.

He brought these children back from

Puerto Rico sometime about the 15th.

He withheld these chil­

His woman ~~ subsequently his wife, Nina,

actually offered to assault the mother of these children when
she attempted to take the children or even talk to the chil­
dren.

It was not until the 25th that she was able -- she found
\

the children on the 24th -- On the 25th of November 1975, she
appeared before a Family Court.

She was given a date by the

Family Court to the 18th day of December -- On the 17fch day
of December, she gave birth to a child by her now husband.
The first time she was able to regain that custody was on the

Mr. Caban married Nina on the 16th day

On the 18th he was scheduled to go before

the court for a hearing.

The premises he described as purchased for the need
of these children he contracted for on the 29th day of the
same month, December»

Subsequently, one year after this case

was decided against him, and I trust that the Court has the
entire record from the Court of Appeals, he made application
before that court to be allowed to proceed as a poor person»
He claims before this Court that he was so allowed to do»

He

was not under the order of the court»
QUESTION:

Mr» Schulslaper, do you think the

Constitution of the United States requires this Court to go
into all of those facts going to the substantiality of the
husband's interest in these children?

Maybe under Qullloln

it does, but that means that under the Constitution we are
required to morf or less act as a domestic relations court,
which I wonder if many of my colleagues signed on for when
they accepted their commissions.
MR. SCHULSLAPER:

Your Honor, thank you, very much»
\

Under the circumstances, I respectfully rest on my brief»

And

I defer to the Attorney General of the State of New York for
the balance of the time»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

are you?
MR. STRUM:

Your Honor, I am not going to discuss

36
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRWIN M. STRUM, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF APPELLEES
MR. STRUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We have heard the attorneys for two adversaries
talk about their clients' rights.

Who speaks for the rights

of the two children, David and Denise?

Who spoke for them

below?
I respectfully submit that the Surrogate of Kings
County was charged with the responsibility of determining how
those children should be protected.

I submit the statutes of

the State of New York gave him that right, and gave him the
opportunity to say, "In the best interest of these children,
I will permit this adoption."
I come to this Court today not to represent any
litigant and not to argue on behalf of either a father or a
mother, but to argue on behalf of these children and their
rights, and the law of the State of New York which permits the
courts to say, "In the best interest of these children, we will
permit an adoption."
QUESTION:

What do you have to say about the

constitutional aspect of a statute which gives a different right
to the natural father from the rights given to the natural
mother?

That's really the legal question, isn't It?
MR. STRUM:

I believe that the State of New York ha©

37
the right to.make a distinction between a natural mother and
a natural father where a child is born out of wedlock.
This Court has time and time again approved dis­
tinctions between natural mothers and natural fathers* in a
situation where the state has an interest to protect the
childreno

I don’t think the difference as provided by the

New York law is very severe*, because the ultimate test in all
situations is the best interest of the children.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the state could

have a law that said that the child could be removed from the
care and custody of both parents* over their objection* as
long as the state concluded that it was in the best interest
of the child —
MR. STRUM:
QUESTION:
MRo STRUM:

I would say this* Your Honor -— and without some finding of unfitness?
No* there would have to be a finding

of unfitness.
QUESTION:

Why doesn’t there have to be seme finding

of unfitness for the father here?
MR. STRUM:

Because I don’t believe the father

stands in the same shoes as the mother.

I don't believe he

is a member of a protected class.
QUESTION:

So* you think -- If he wanted to adopt --

If the unmarried father wanted to adopt* over the objection of
the mother* the state could not permit the adoption without

38
some finding of unfitness of the mother?
MRa STRUM:
^

or proof.

There would have to be some indication

I don't know if it would have to reach as far as

unfitness* Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It would be the same thing* I take it*

that the law is where the parents were married but are divorced .
MR0 STRUM:

I would say so* yes.

QUESTION:

In that case* either parent has --

MR. STRUM:

I wouldn't use the word "veto"* but

either parent* under certain circumstances* and under certain
statutory —
I

QUESTION:

Well* either parent there has more of a

right than this father does.
MRe STRUM:

That's correct* Your Honor* and I concede

that* but I don't think -~
QUESTION:

Give the wife the veto and deny it to

the father?
MR. STRUM:
QUESTION:
you quit* aren't you?
MR. STRUM:

Yes.
You are going to get to Stanley before
Let me know when you get there.
I don't think Stanley v. Illinois ha©

any relationship to the factual situation or the legal situa­
tion here.

Here we are dealing with a situation where we have

a competing interest between a mother and a father.

Now* there:

is no doubt that these people have an interest in the child --

39
QUESTION:

I understood that the mother wasn’t

adopting this child»
MR» STRUM:

Yes* she was»

The mother and her

husband.
QUESTION:
MR» STRUM:

The mother and the husband?
Yes,

Which would be the normal pro­

cedure in the case of a natural mother.
And I think the court has a right to say that in
order to benefit the child we will allow such an adoption.
QUESTION:

Are we talking about a statute that

applies to any situation?
MR» STRUM:
QUESTION:

That is correct* Your Honor.
And there is nothing wrong with a statute

that Singles out simply on sex and nothing else -- You say
there is nothing wrong with that statute?
MR. ETRUM:

It is not on the basis of sex.

It is

on the basis of a mother or a father* and I think* Your Honor QUESTION:

Do you know any mothers that are

fathers?
MR. STRUM:

No* Your Honor.

But I think there is a

distinction* and I think this Court has recognized it* between
natural mothers and natural fathers where they were not married
And I think that5© the important factor here»

I don't think

that this man has any paternal rights in the child.
the child is somebody who has to be protected.

I think

And the state*

40

as long as it is reasonable in doing so, can pass a law which
permits such protection,

I think the state can make a dis­

tinction between a natural father and a natural mother* where
they are not married,

And I think this Court recognized in

Quilloin that a father of a child born out of wedlock does not
have the same status as a father of a child born in wedlock,
QUESTION:

Being unfamiliar with that case* as I

understand it* left this case completely out* didn't It?
MR, STRUM:
out.

No* it really didn't leave this case

It dealt specifically with —
QUESTION:

Didn't it?

MR. STRUM:

You tell me.

I think very frankly* Your Honor* this

case is a situation where you have a mother and a father who

are not married.
QUESTION:

General Strum* assume a case where a

child is six years old* spent three years with the father*
three years with the mother* no marriage.

What is the justi»

ficafcion for giving them different rights when they get into
a battle of this kind?
MR, STRUM:
different.

I don't say that their rights are

I say to you the test will ultimately be the same*

the best interest of the child.
QUESTION:

Well* I thought everyone had agreed that

even if the best interest of the child might lie with the
father* the mother could still -- assuming she hadn't abandoned,

41
and all the

rest of it, she could still object.

Isn’t there a difference,, under the New York
statute, in the position of the mother and the position of
the father?
MR. STRUM:
QUESTION:

Yes, there is.
Assuming that equal time with the child,

and all the rest of it -- six year old child -- What'e the
justification for the difference?
MR. STRUM:

The difference is that the Legislature

of the State of Hew York has determined that a natural mother,
absent special circumstances, bears a closer relationship with
her child, by the very fact of being a mother, than a father
does, that there is a difference between a mother and father,
vis-a-vis the relationship of the child, vis-a-vis the feelings
toward the child, vis-a-vis living together and -QUESTION:

The Legislature has determined that, but

what’s the basis for that determination?

How do you support

that?
MR, STRUM:
QUESTION:
MR. STRUM:

I think that's the experience of mankind,
I see.
As long as the statute bears a reasonable

relationship, and the object of the legislation is to protect
the children, and I don't think that the father is in a pro­
tected class, I don't think it is for this Court to say that
the legislation is improper.

I think the legislature of a

42
state has a right to set up these standards, make these
requirements and make these rules*

And

I

think as long as

these rules and regulations, and statutes, bear a reasonable
relationship to every day life and the interests of the child,

I

think that that is sufficient.

statute.

I

We cannot have a perfect

am not here to claim that our statute is perfect,

but as long as the test is the beet interest of the child I
think that is all that is required.

I

I

don't think, as

have

indicated before, that the mere accident of birth, that a man
is the father of a child, gives him rights to control the
destiny of that child v*here the best interests of the child
call for another type of action.

I don't feel that, under

the circumstances, that this statute should be thrown out,
merely

because

the

man comes here

and he says,

"Well,

I

really am interested in this kid."
There was a full hearing.

the childs and all of those facts are facts which he had
before him*, including the relationship of this father to the
child* Including what had happened between the father and
the child* what had happened between the father and the mother.
All of this was before the court.

The court weighed these

facts and then determined the best Interest of the child.
