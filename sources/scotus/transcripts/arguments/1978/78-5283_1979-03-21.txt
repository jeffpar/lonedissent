HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ms. Colville, I believe you can proceed whenever
you are ready now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. CAROLYN J. COLVILLE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. COLVILLE:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether a Federal
district court should issue a writ of habeas corpus when
there is insufficient evidence in the State court record to
convince a rational trier of fact of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.
A statement of the relevant proceedings is as
follows:

The petitioner, James A. Jackson,was tried and

convicted of first degree murder in the Circuit Court of
Chesterfield County and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Briefly, the evidence indicated that he had shot the deceased,
Mrs. Mary Cole, twice, that several shots were fired at the
scene.

Did he engage in target practice that day?

However,

there is extensive evidence indicating he consumed a large
amount of alcohol, and shortly before the death of Mr3. Cole
the two of them had drank two fifths of whisky, a fifth of
some other alcoholic beverage that was not divulged in the

4
record, and an undetermined amount of baer.

He admitted to

the shooting in a statement made to the police.

He indicated

it was in self-defense.
He then unsuccessfully appealed his case to the
Virginia Supreme Court,

He thereupon filed a pro se petition

for writ of habeas corpus to the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in which he made
numerous allegations, including an allegation that his
conviction for first-degree murder was unsupported by
evidence of premeditation.
The district court judge thereupon searched the
record and determined that he could find no evidence of
premeditation to be found,
QUESTION:

Now, how did this district judge come

to be addressing this subject?
MS, COLVILLE:

Mr, Jackson alleged in his petition

that his conviction was not supported by evidence of
premeditation.
QUESTION:
been before a court.

This wasn't the first time the case had
The case wasn't initiated in the Federal

court.
MS‘, COLVILLE:

No.

It was initiated in the

Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, Virginia.

He then

unsuccessfully appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme
Court„

5
QUESTION:

What was the Federal court doing with it?

What brought the Federal court into the case?
MS ° COLVILLE %

He was alleging a deprivation of

rights.
QUESTION:

Oh.

By what kind of a procedure was he

in Federal court?
MS. COLVILLE:

He filed a petition for writ of

habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

Habeas corpus.

MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Right.

Yes.

I had the impression from your

earlier remarks that the case was being tried by a Federal
judge.
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

No.

No.

The district court judge --

There's quite a difference, isn't there?

MS. COLVILLE:

Yes.

Yes, there is, your Honor.

The district court judge searched the State court
record and determined that he could not find evidence of
premeditation.

He then dismissed the other allegations for

failure to exhaust the court remedies.
The State of Virginia thereupon filed a timely
notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit.

The Fourth Curcuit in a per curiam opinion

reversed the findings of the district court judge and held
that it could find some evidence of premeditation, and need not

6

search the record any further to see if a rational trier of
fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt»
Whereupon, we filed petition for writ of certiorari to this
Court.
Both the district court and the Federal court of
appeals applied Virginia law, whereupon one may be so
intoxicated as to be incapable of deliberation»

In addition,

both courts applied the holding of the 1960 case of Thompson v.
City of Louisville, which held that it was a violation of due
process to convict and punish a person without some evidence
of guilt.
It is our contention that it is also a violation
of due process to convict and punish a person when no
rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

You think that’s the situation here on

this record?
MS. COLVILLE:

Yes, 1 do, your Honor.

I don't

think that a rational trier could have found guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

I take it you will expand on that in

due course in your comments.
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:
manslaughter?

Yes, your Honor.

could they have found him guilty of

7
MS. COLVILLE:

I think it is .

possible that they
\

could have found him guilty of manslaughter»
QUESTION:

Would that take it out from under

Thompson?
MSo COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

In Thompson they say you couldn’t be

convicted of anything„
MS, COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

I think —

This was a question of degree.

MS. COLVILLE:
degree.

Certainly it is a question of

We personally have no —
QUESTION:

Isn't that a little different from

Thompson?
MS. COLVILLE:

I think the holdings of this Court

after Thompson, I believe four years after, about 1974,
indicated that there has to be some evidence of every
element of the offense.

We are indicating that there is no

evidence of premeditation.
QUESTION:

Do you think he should go free?

MS. COLVILLE:

No, your Honor.

The respondents

have addressed the issue of what can be done even if this
Court found that there is insufficient evidence.

I think

the common belief is that he could not be retried for firstdegree murder due to the double jeopardy clause of the
Constitution.

However, we would agree that he could either

8

be sent back to the State courts for sentencing for seconddegree or for a retrial# because the only issue has been
premeditation# a necessary element of first-degree murder# not
second-degree.
QUESTION?

Do we need Thompson v. Louisville to do

that?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

For resentencing.

MS. COLVILLE;
QUESTION:

No# your Honor.

You are relying on the Winship case.

MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

To send it back to the State courts?

Yes # your Honor.

The question# I suppose# is whether the

Winship case as a constitutional matter requires that there
be proof beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a
conviction in a State court or only that the jury be instructed
that they must find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

That's

the real question, isn't it?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Yes# your Honor.

Our contention ■—

The jury was so instructed in this

case# wasn't it?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Yes# sir.

And arguably that's all that Winship

requires.
MS. COLVILLE:

Well, your Honor# first of all, there

was not a jury in this case.

It was tried by a judge.

9

QUESTION:

Well, then, presumably the trier of fact

followed that —
MS. COLVILLE:

It is our contention that in

Winship, which held the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment requires that there be proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, certainly a jury instruction to the effect that the
jury cannot convict unless there is evidence beyond a
reasonable doubt is insufficient if in fact that jury has
found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

Ms, Colville, the facts of Winship

were that the trial judge stated that he could find these
particular defendants guilty by a preponderance of the
evidence but he couldn't bring himself to find them guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt»
MSo COLVILLE:

Yes, your Honor.

I believe that this Court in addressing the issue
as a juvenile indicated that in a juvenile proceeding there
cannot be a conviction unless the charges have been proved
beyond a reasonable doubt.
Now, arguably the Federal courts have said that
this is only a jury instruction.

However, at least four

courts and at least two appeals courts in the context of
a direct appeal have indicated that In re Winship requires
that there be proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

Where do you get your definition of

10

beyond a reasonable doubt?
MS.COLVILLE:

From In re Winship* which held that

the Due Process Clause requires that in a criminal setting
there must be — that you cannot convict a person unless there
is proof beyond a reasonable doubt»
QUESTION;

I realize that, but I presume that if

your argument were accepted by this Court* other courts
would have to decide was there or was there not proof ’’beyond
a reasonable doubt«"

Where do you get the definition of

"beyond a reasonable doubt"?
MS. COLVILLE;

Your Honor* that is not an easy
«

question»
QUESTION:

No* it isn't»

MS, COLVILLE:

I do think that it has been a

standard that has been generally accepted in both the Federal
and State courts for some time.
QUESTION;

I think --

For some time.

It was accepted before

the Constitution was adopted* wasn't it?
MS. COLVILLE:
accepted for some time»

Yes* your Honor.

It has been

I think the courts are far more

familiar with that standard than the no-evidence standard of
Thompson* which I submit is a far more difficult standard for
a court to apply than beyond a reasonable doubt.
are familiar with beyond a reasonable doubt.
been with the no-evidence rule,o£ Thompson.

The courts

They have not

11
QUESTION %

But you are not prepared,, at least now,

to expand on simply the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt" in
offering guidance as to how courts would analyze transcripts
under situations like this.
MS. COLVILLE:

Well, your Honor, if you mean by

can we offer a definition, no.

I think what we can offer is

that if this Court adopted our position that the Due Process
Clause requires this and that it is something that is
cognizable in a writ of habeas corpus, what we would ba
suggesting is that the Federal district court would give
great deference to the findings of the State.

We are not

suggesting that there be a great overruling of State court
cases.

What we are saying is if there is conflict of

testimony, the conflict should in most cases be favoring the
State.

We are not asking for second guessing.

We are asking

if there is a clear issue of innocence here, then the Federal
courts should intervene.
QUESTION:

In your State, what is the reviewing

standard?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Clearly erroneous, your Honor.

When a convicted criminal appeals and

says the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, what standard does the appellate court use
in your State?
MSo COLVILLE:

In Virginia, there has not been a

12

ruling indicating that In re Winship requires to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt for the State to overrule the lower court
finding.

What they have indicated is if the finding is

clearly erroneous, or in this particular case where they
simply indicated whether there has been any violation of the
Constitution.

They did not elaborate on that.

In Virginia

as of right now —
QUESTION:

Let's assume in the ordinary criminal

case in Virginia, no constitutional issues involved in it,
there is just a conviction and a claim that the evidence was
insufficient.

I suppose the standard in Virginia, they

instruct the jury that they must find beyond a reasonable
doubt.
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And in reviewing the sufficiency of the

evidence, what does the — you say the Virginia appellate
courts simply say —
MS. COLVILLE:

If it's clearly erroneous.

They

have not -QUESTION:

If what is clearly erroneous?

MS. COLVILLE:

The judgment of the lower court.

If you are --QUESTION:

The decision of the jury or what?

MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Clearly erroneous or that -—

13
MS. COLVILLE:

Clearly erroneous, not proof beyond

a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

Is there a difference in the standard

when a judge tries the case without a jury and when he tries
it with a jury?
MS. COLVILLE:

No, your Honor.

Both would be under

an obligation to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
In this particular case we did have a judge, and
we have briefed the arguments that it should not make any
difference that a judge tried this case rather than a jury.
I don't think a judge will make an error as often as a jury.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that the Federal court

should apply a different standard from the highest court of
the State in reviewing the conviction?
MS. COLVILLE:

Your Honor, I think Virginia has

not accepted In re Winship as requiring a substantive right
to proof.
QUESTION:

What evidence do you base your statement

on, Ms. Colville, that Virginia has not accepted Winship?
Have they said so?
MS. COLVILLE:

No, there simply has not been any

holding where they have come down and said that, "We will
overturn if the proof is insufficient, if the proof has not
been beyond a reasonable doubt."
QUESTION:

Well, generally, reviewing courts in

14
States very clearly do accept Unship.. -As you say, Virginia
has not.

That's not the test in the appellate court, not

whether or not the members of the appellate court are
convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but only
whether they can say that a rational jury could have so found,
MS, COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

That's the test,

MS, COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Certainly, your Honor,

Or a rational judge,

MS, COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Certainly, your Honor,

Rational trier.

Rational fact-finder,

MS, COLVILLE:

They are saying that if someone had

acted non-arbitrarily, they would have found the person not
guilty,
QUESTION:

What I want to get at, and I am not

clear on, I am still confused from the outset of your
argument:

Are you suggesting that there should be the

same standard in the Federal district court on writ of
habeas corpus as there would be in the State review?
MS, COLVILLE:

I am suggesting that if In re Winship

which we feel establishes a substantive right to proof —
QUESTION:

That's a substantive right for the trial

in the State court, isn't it?
MS, COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Yes,

We would argue —

Does that continue all the way through

15
up in habeas corpus

,

or 2255, 2254

if the State had a

similar remedy?
MS. COLVILLE:

We would argue that if there is a

Federal right to proof, then certainly yes.

What we have

argued is that the Federal district judge would look at the
record —
QUESTION:

Doesn't this case come to us- with the

presumption of regularity in the application of the Federal
Constitution by the Virginia courts?
MS. COLVILLE:
a mistake has been made.

Yes, your Honor, but we feel that
And I think the fact that the

Federal district judge indicated that a mistake was made also,
that, in fact, the person should have been acquitted of
first-degree murder.
QUESTION:
in

Well, I thought your argument was that

Federal habeas corpus the wrong standard was applied.

Isn't that it?
MS. COLVILLE:

Our argument is that at this point

the Federal Courts have seemingly not adopted the position
of rational trier of fact as to habeas corpus.

And we would

urge —
QUESTION:

Was I wrong or right in understanding

your argument to be that in this Federal habeas corpus case
the district court and the court of appeals were in error in
applying the Thompson standard rather than the winship

16
Standard?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

Isn't that your claim?

MS. COLVILLE:

Yes, your Honor.

Now, we realize that in recent years this Court
has been cutting back the scope of habeas corpus out of
considerations

of comity and federalism, particularly in

cases where someone did not exhaust their State court
remedies, where someone didn't object, or particularly the
Stone v. Powell, which we have put great

emphasis on in our

brief, where the exclusionary rule was involved, which this
Court held frustrated the criminal process.
However, we would urge the Court to particularly
look at footnote 31 of that case where it is indicated that
innocence is at the heart of habeas corpus.

Because what we

are in fact arguing here, if the evidence was not sufficient
to convince a rational trier of fact, then that person was
technically innocent of that offense.
Now, in that footnote, the Court discussed various
States' rights interests, including federalism, state
autonomy, fiction.

However, the clear implication of it is

that innocence should be of overriding importance.

I think

that is basically what it boils down to here, that innocence
should be of importance to the writ of habeas corpus and that
considerations of comity and federalism should be of secondary

17
importance.
QUESTION:

Ms. Colville, could I ask you a question

about your theory as to why the judgment is arbitrary on the
\

premeditation issue.,

Is it because you think no rational

judge could conclude that the defendant was not intoxicated?
Or is it because you argue that no rational judge could find
that shooting twice and reloading the gun and shooting from
only half an inch away and so forth could be evidence of
premeditation?
f.

MS„ COLVILLE:

My argument would be that he was

so indeed intoxicated as to be incapable of premeditation.
QUESTION:

No rational judge could believe he was

not intoxicated,
MS. COLVILLE:

That would be my argument.

Under

Virginia law a mind may be so bewildered by intoxicating
beverages as to be incapable of deliberation.
QUESTION:

The court of appeals relied on the fact

that the deputy sheriff obviously didn’t think

he wa

totally intoxicated because he let him retain his weapon after
he had seen him with a weapon.
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

Is that some evidence of not being

totally intoxicated?
MS. COLVILLE:

No, your Honor, we would not agree

that that would be some evidence.

I think the record, the

18

transcript indicates that, first of all, the deputy sheriff
knew the woman, and I think there is some doubt whether he
knew the petitioner, but apparently he felt embarrassed by
them coming up, swaggering, bloodshot eyes, and he wanted
them out.

I think he also indicated he wanted badly to get

back inside the cafe.

He went outside with them but wanted

to get back in the cafe with the other police officers.
I think a reasonable, rational explanation would
be that he wanted to finish his dinner.
QUESTION:

Isn’t it a question of fact as to

whether the man is drunk or not?
MS. COLVILLE:

Yes, your Honor, it would be a

matter of fact.
QUESTION:

Didn’t a judge decide that fact?

MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

How can you attack that?

MS. COLVILLE:

Well, your Honor, we are arguing

that a rational trier of fact could not have —
QUESTION:

Why?

Why is it irrational to find that

this man wasn't too drunk?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Because I think the —-

What evidence do you have that shows

that he was not too drunk — or that he was too drunk?
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

I think the fact ~

All yon have is that he was drunk.

19

QUESTION:

And ha consumed a fifth of whisky.

QUESTION:

I know soma people who get drunk off

of one drink of whisky and I know others who can drink two
fifths.
QUESTION:

You are asking for a constitutional

rule that proof that a man has consumed at least a fifth of
whisky demolishes the possibility that he could not have a
requisite intent to kill somebody.
MS. COLVILLE:
as to that.

I am not asking a constitutional rule

I am asking a constitutional rule that a rational

trier could not determine that.
I think first of all that there was a great deal
of evidence here that he had drank the entire day.

The deputy

sheriff that you referred to earlier, Mr. Justice Stevens —
QUESTION:

Are you arguing that because the

Federal district judge on habeas corpus, or that a Federal
district judge on habeas corpus, if that judge disagrees with
the State court judge who tried out the fact issue, then the
Federal court determination prevails?
MS. COLVILLE:

I would say that the Federal district

court judge, if he gives all the deference necessary to the
State court judge, if he determines at that point that no
rational trier of fact could have found guilt -beyond a
reasonable doubt, or in this particular case intoxication and
premeditation, then I would say, yes, definitely the writ

20

would have to be issued.
QUESTION:

And then three other Federal court

juuges from the Fourth Circuit can drav. an opposite conclusion
from that of the district judge?
MS. COLVILLE:

Well, your Honor, I think the Fourth

Circuit in its opinion, first of all, held that it was under
the obligation to follow Thompson v. City of Louisville,
and then went on to say that it did not feel that it needed
to look to see if there was evidence sufficient to convince
a rational trier •—
QUESTION:

That’s what I thought your argument was,

Ms. Colville, not what the result should be in this case on
the facts of this case, but rather that the Federal courts
and Federal habeas corpus since the Winship case, which came
after the Thompson case, are obligated by the Constitution to
apply a different test and a different rule than was a plied
here.
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Certainly, your Honor.

Is that your argument?

MS. COLVILLE:

We are arguing that the Fourth

Circuit and the district court applied the wrong standard.
They applied the 1960 standard of Thompson.

We would urge

that the 1970 case of In re Winship should have been the
proper standard for the courts to have applied in this case.
And we feel that the innocence of the person should be of

21

overriding importance in looking at other State considerations.
but overall, yes, we are asking that a Federal writ of habeas
corpus be issued if no rational trier of fact could have
found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ' for that particular
offense.
QUESTION:

Counsel, you just said that the

innocence is of overriding importance.

I don’t know whether

you mean to suggest that that is the only conceivable factor
to be considered.

You are familiar with our decision in

Patterson v. New^ Jbrjc

where

we said punishment of those

found guilty by a jury, for example, is not forbidden merely
because there is a remote possibility in some instances that
an innocent person might go to jail?
MS. COLVILLE:
catch that.

Excuse me, your Honor.

I didn’t

I am sorry.
QUESTION:

I am just curious whether you think that

innocence is, the possibility of innocence is —
MS. COLVILLE:
QUESTION:

Is the only

—

-- the only factor, yes.

MS. COLVILLE:

~~ determination?

No, but I think

in granting writ of habeas corpus we have to look at if there
has been a deprivation of due process rights.
other principles can come into play.

Then I think

This Court has, in the

last few years, indicated comity and federalism in Francis v.
Henderson, Estelle v. Williams, and Uainwright v. Sykes , that

22

these other things will come into play, but that when
innocence is at the heart of the argument, the innocence is
at the heart of the right involved, then that should be of
overriding importance.
QUESTION:

Patterson v. New York was a direct

appeal here from the State courts, so there wasn’t any problem
of comity and Federal habeas.

And it was in that case that

the Court said that punishment of those found guilty by a jury
is not forbidden merely because there is a remote possibility
in some instances that an innocent person might go to jail.
MS. COLVILLE:

Well, your Honor, I can just go back

to my argument of Stone v. Powell of innocence in the footnote,
indicating innocence is at the heart of habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

But that was in an exclusionary sense,

in the sense that if there was no — if the claim made had no
bearing on innocence, perhaps it couldn’t be treated in
Federal habeas.

But there has never been any suggestion that

any Federal constitutional claim couldn't be treated on direct
review here, as was the case in Patterson.
MS. COLVILLE:

Certainly, your Honor.

I would just

argue that in the writ of habeas corpus this should be the
proper standard.
I reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Attorney General.

Very well.

23

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARSHALL COLEMAN
ON BEIIALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COLEMAN:
nlease the Court, this

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it nay
case does present the legal issue of

whether or not the sane evidence standard that was established
in the Thompson v. City of Louisville case should be over­
turned in favor of the rule of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt upon a collateral attack by writ of habeas corpus of a
Virginia, or State, judgment.

And it is our position that

those two cases are thoroughly consistent, one with the other,
and that as the Chief Justice has suggested, the standard of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been employed in the
several

States for time out of mind and, in fact, is the

standard in Virginia, and upon review by the Virginia
Supreme Court the test is whether a rational juror could
decide and hold that proof had been established beyond a
reasonable doubt.
We have reviewed by transcript already in Virginia.
Waen someone files a petition for writ to our Virginia
Supreme Court, he is not entitled to a hearing, but he is
entitled to a review of the record to determine on the
question of sufficiency of the evidence,whether that is
shown in the transcript.
QUESTION:

But despite your practice since time

immemorial in the State of Virginia, not until the Winship case

24

was it clearly decided that the Federal Constitution required
that a State prove a person guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
*

before, it could convict him.
MR. COLEMAN:

My reading of Wins hip is that the

Court was saying in that case that as to a juvenile trial,
the proof had to be beyond a reasonable doubt if preponderance
of the evidence was not sufficient.- and that lest there b'
doubt, it would say as a matter of constitutional law that was
the rule.

But I have cited some cases here that I think

suggest that that was not a new rule, was one that was —
QUESTION:
common law.

It was surely not a new rule in the

But it is my understanding that

not until

the Winship case had it been squarely decided —
MR. COLEMAN:

I think that's right.

It was

constitutionalized at that point.
QUESTION:

Right.

Since it was constitutionalized

at that point and since it has been the practice since time
almost immemorial of Federal courts on Federal habeas corpus
to apply the constitutional test to State criminal convictions,
wily shouldn't the rule of Winship be the applicable test now
chat Winship has been decided, which came after Thompson?
MR. COLEMAN:

I think for several reasons.

I think

..ne reasons that have already been alluded to, effective use
of resources, federalism, comity, avoiding —
QUESTION:

Well, on that basis we could just not

25

consider First Amendment questions, for example.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That would save some time.

MR.' COLEMAN:
case, you see, the case
then it

That is certainly correct.

It would save some time.

But in this

is taken on appeal.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. COLEMAN:

Then it comes back to the Federal

court, and then the question there —
QUESTION:

That's true in any Federal habeas corpus.
/

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

It is.

Except you have to exhaust your State

remedies before you can go into the Federal court.
MR. COLEMAN:

But with respect to sufficiency of the

evidence, of course, that is an objection that any defendant
can make.

So that the resources of the court, if it has to go

through and have another trial by transcript, would be
monumental, and it would engage the resources of the Federal
courts to the extent that it would be using up the time of the
courts that could better be focused —QUESTION:

If it is a constitutional duty to do it,
y

it is a constitutional duty to do it.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That is the question, isn't it?

MR. COLEMAN:

The question is, it seems to me ---

QUESTION:

It's just too bad if it's going to add

a lot of business to the Federal courts.

But if that's their

job, it’s their job,
QUESTION:

Is it not the question, Mr. Attorney

General, whether after Winship the States in trial of criminal
cases are constitutionally obliged —
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s precisely the point.

— to apply the reasonable doubt standard?

Isn't that all Winship decided?
MR. COLEMAN:

That’s precisely the point, that it

may —
QUESTION:

It had nothing to do directly with

collateral attacks.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s exactly right.

Is there any State in the Union that

you know at the time of Winship that did not apply —
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

I don't know.

— the reasonable doubt rule?

MR. COLEMAN:

But I do think that after Winship

in every case the rule was is there proof beyond a reasonable
doubt as a standard in the State court.

Now, what the

Louisville rule, I think, established was that the Court was
willing to look at the record to see if there was any evidence
to support that.

But it seems to me that the Court could

consider in this case that since there is an interest in

27

cutting back on these cases,and the rule of Stone v„ Powell
is that if there has been an opportunity for a full and fair
hearing in the State court, that there is no need to redo that
in the Federal court and —
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Attorney General, of

course, review is not sought of the decision in your supreme
court in this case.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Suppose there had been a petition for

review of your supreme court on the ground that Winship had
not been properly applied.

Now, surely that is a Federal

question which we could have reviewed.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And we might have disagreed with your

supreme court and reversed this conviction.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

And now, your suggestion is that

the litigants ought to be limited to coming to us directly
on review from State courts rather than go into Federal habeas
corpus.
MR. COLEMAN:

I am making that suggestion to the

Court.
QUESTION:

Right.

Don’t we have enough to do up

here?
MR. COLEMAN:

I am suggesting to the court if they

28
come up on direct review, that's sufficient protection and
check and supervision over what's happening —
QUESTION:

You know something about the happenstance

of certiorari grants, don't you?
MR. COLEMAN:

I do.

I realise that, and I am

suggesting that habeas corpus could still exist for the
purpose of determining whether there had been an opportunity
for a full and fair hearing.

But once there has been given

an opportunity —
QUESTION:
misunderstand it.

I understand your argument.

Perhaps I

You suggest we ought to foreclose habeas

review in cases like this and limit the review, if there is to
be any Federal review, to direct review by this Court of your
highest State court?

I am suggesting to the Court to

MR. COLEMAN:

consider that as a possibility.

We have urged in this case,

first of all, that the Thompson rule should be maintained.
We think that is very important.

But in view of the cases that

have occurred recently, the Wainwright case and Estelle and
Francis and Stone v. Powell, that would certainly be cons . tent

QUESTION:

If it8s any comfort to you, I didn't

agree with any of those.
MR. COLEMAN: I read that.
Your Honors, I would say simply that in this case —-

29

QUESTION:

Stone v. Powell is different than this

case, isn't it?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, in —

If your adversary's argument has any

substance that innocence is involved and is at the heart of
Federal habeas, that was not true in Stone v. Powell.
MR. COLEMAN:

I think it is different, but it seems

to me that the principle makes sense across the board because
Stone v. Powell

is saying if there is an opportunity for full

and a fair hearing, there needs to be an end.

And as has been

said in one of the case, if the thing can be done well once,
there is no need, to do it twice.
QUESTION:

We haven't pursued Stone v. Powell

every time we have been asked to.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

I understand that.

Your argument would lead, I should think,

inexorably to the conclusion that if there has been a valid
conviction in the State court, that's the end of the matter,
there could never be Federal habeas corpus.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, as far as sufficiency of the

evidence is concerned »QUESTION:

That would have denied review in

Thompson v. Louisville.

Obviously the police court in

Louisville there thought there was proof beyond a reasonable
aoubt or it would not have convicted Thompson.

30

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, ifc always leaves the opportunity

for direct review.
QUESTION:

I know, of course there is opportunity

for discretionary direct review, the petition for certiorari
here.

But we are talking about Federal habeas corpus.

It

seems to me that your argument leads ineluctably to the
conclusion that Federal habeas corpus is never available if
there has been a valid State court conviction.
MR. COLEMAN:

I think it is available for the

court to determine the question of the opportunity of a full
and fair hearing.

I don't think that has been completely

I don't think we know exactly what —

QUESTION:

But you said when there has been a full

and fair hearing, that's the end of the matter, there is no
Federal habeas corpus ever.
MR. COLEMAN:

For sufficiency of the evidence.

QUESTION: For anything.

That’s where your argument

leads.
MR. COLEMAN:

I think vh- c the effect of habeas

corpus would be is to see still if constitutional, rights are
being violated.

If there is not in fact -—

QUESTION:

V7ould constitutional rights be

violated if a State had convicted a person on evidence of a
lesser standard than beyond a reasonable doubt under Winship?
MR. COLEMAN:

I think under Winship the only test

3.1

would be has that standard of proof been applied in the case.
QUESTION:
the jury»

Had they mouthed the right things to

Is that it?
MR. COLEMAN:

But I think there would be ways to

look behind the substance, look to the substance if the
appearance of justice did not conform with the substance.
QUESTION:

That's just what this is about, isn't

That's exactly what this case is about.
MR. COLEMAN:

If it please the Court, I will

settle for the adoption, as I say in the brief, of the
Thompson rule.
QUESTION:
Attorney General.

Let me give you an easier one, Mr.

If this had been a jury trial with the

finest of instructions on reasonable doubt, et cetera, and
the same record you have here, wouldn't you be in a better
position?
MR. COLEMAN:

If there had bean a jury in this

case?
QUESTION:

With the full instruction of reasonable

doubt right out of winship.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, except that the law may be —

Wouldn't you be in better shape?

MR. COLEMAN:

It could be argued about what

standard they were supposed to apply, but the law in Virginia
is that the judge is supposed to apply the same standard that

32
the trier of fact does.
QUESTION:

Would you draw a line between those two?

MR. COLEMAN:

V7ell, I haven’t thought about that.

I think that as long as —
QUESTION:

It would be helpful.

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, if it's helpful, I will adopt

it.
QUESTION:

What if, going a little further than

my brother Marshall's suggestion, this had been a jury trial
and there had been absolutely perfect instructions on the
duty of a jury not to convict until it found guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt and on the presumption of innocence and all
the rest of it, but that in fact the evidence was no stronger
than it was in Thompson v. Louisville and the court of appeals
said, the State appellate system

erroneously,let's assume,

had held that instructions were fine and we think the
evidence was sufficient under that standard.
Now, is a Federal district court absolutely fore­
closed from examining it?
MR. COLEMAN:

If you adopt the standard, I think

you are in the same position as with Wainwright, that you are
cut off because of procedural default.

There — here you are

cut off —QUESTION’’

There was no procedural default at all.

There had been pursuit of State remedies —

33

MR. COLEMAN:

I think you are right.

As long as

there was the ability to raise that question and get a full
and fair hearing under the —
QUESTION:

That's the end, no Federal —

MR„ COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's the end of it.

That's what I thought your argument was.

MR. COLEMAN:

Now, my point on that, your Honor,

is simply that there is, I think, in this Court a greater
sensitivity to the integrity and capacities of the State
courts.

There is a growing recognition that the State courts

are well able to apply Federal law to administer their
State criminal laws and that as long as they are doing that,
that there is no reason to retry cases, to duplicate effort,
and to expand the time between when someone is charged and
when the case is over.
QUESTION: That argument, I think, leads to overruling
Thompson v. Louisville., at least insofar as its applicability
to collateral attack goes„
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Yes, I think it's right, isn't it.

I

think it's correct.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I don't agree that it is necessarily

right.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, obviously, in order to uphold

34
the judgment of the Fourth Circuit * it's not necessary for
♦

the Court to go this far.

And the chief thrust of my brief

obviously is simply that the standard of Louisville v. Thompson
is still the correct application except that the Court wants
to go further and break out into a new area and say as far
as sufficiency of the evidence is concerned, we are satisfied
the State courts can do it and do it well.

And that has been

the experience in the past.
I think that the -QUESTION:

That would be an expansion of Stone v.

Powell,■basicallyf wouldn't it?
MR. COLEMAN:

It would be.

QUESTION:

But

a stone v. Powell approach.

But a Stone v. Powell approach.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

It would be.

It certainly would be.

To this case.

MR. COLEMAN:

It would be the application of the

Stone v. Powell doctrine into this case.
QUESTION:

To that extent, I gather a pro tanto

appeal by the court, I mean, Federal habeas corpus statute —
MR. COLEMAN:

I think there would still be something

there for habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

I said pro tanto.

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

With a judge trial as compared with a

35

jury trial, that same interest is -- where the Federal
district judge was a former State judge of the same State
and where we have a judge trial without a jury trial, why
can’t he do the same thing?
MR. COLEMAN:

He is a former State judge,

Assume where the State judge is —■

I didn’t hear that part.
QUESTION:

Where the district judge is a former

State judge.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And you ask him to pass on a judgment

by a State judge in a trial without a jury, would you give
him some leeway?
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, it would be treating people that

had gone before a jury in a different manner, I suppose,
because you would be cutting off, you would be chilling
somewhat, I suppose, their interest in taking a jury trial.
But I think that he would be just as capable.
The question that all of this raises in my mind is
that who is to say what is a correct verdict?

Judges disagree

on points that are very particularized and very slight in many
cases.

It has been said by Justice Jackson that this Court

is infallible because it!s final, and it's not final because
it's infallible.

There could be a different disposition if

we had another level of appellate courts.

We have one judge

in Chesterfield agreeing and thinking it’s proof beyond a

36
reasonable doubt.

Then we have the district court disagreeing.

The Fourth Circuit comas back and says,, well, it takes another
view, it3s OK.

This Court might have a third or fourth view.

And then there might be — if it were tried in a different
forum.
The point is, it seems to me, that there is a very
important consideration not to be dismissed out of hand that
the finality of these proceedings and the dignity and the
integrity of the State courts is of such a level now that
the Court might consider departing, and in fact contracting,
the expansion of some habeas corpus.

This could give the

Court, it seems to me, the ability to look very carefully at the:
fewer needles in the haystack, because in looking for all
those needles sometimes I think it almost comes to the, point
is it worth finding and will we recognize when we see them.
Hundreds of pages of transcript are gore throught i think even
for applying the some-evidence standard.

Obviously it's much

easier, but it is still a tremendous job.
So I would simply suggest to the Court that the
State courts know how to administer criminal laws —

But

I think that with sufficiency of the evidence, I can make a
case, as I have tried to do today, that that is one area where
you had a sifting of the evidence, you had a full canvass by
the State procedures of the facts.

It has gone to the

appellate review, you have got judges that are experienced and
practiced in these matters, and that could be the end of it
consistent with their constitutional obligations.

It would be

obviously, if the only review

QUESTION:

Do you think the Federal habeas statute

was intended as a substitute for an additional layer of
review in the conventional sense of review?
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, the habeas statute has, of

course, been a changing thing over the years.

It seems to

me that its ideal was the vindication of fairness, of due
process, the constitutional rights that all people in the
country have.

And I think its expansion has grown.

It was

originally thought, I believe, to contest only matters of
jurisdiction.

There is a historical disagreement —-

QUESTIONs

The scope of the Federal judge in

Virginia then is not the same as the scope of the highest
court in the State of Virginia?
MR. COLEMAN:

I don't think it is.

If you adopted

Winship, it seems to me, you would make the supreme court of
Virginia and the supreme court of every State in the Union
absolutely inferior to every district court.
QUESTION:

General Coleman, X don't know whether

40

you were in on the initial habeas proceedings or not, but I
notice on page 25 of the appendix that the case not only has
a civil number, it has a magistrate number.

Do you know

whether this case was originally referred by the habeas judge
to a magistrate?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION;

No, it wasn6t.

Mr. Attorney General, another easy one.

It's true in combing this record nobody who has made a
decision in this case has shown any expertise in whether the
man is too drunk to know what he is doing,,

up until now,

isn't that right?
MR. COLEMAN;

MR. COLEMAN:

And it would be true here.

QUESTION:

That’s what I am saying.

QUESTION:

So what do you

If you had 12 lay jurors who passed

information or knowlege about their capacity to make

We have

no information about that»
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

You could, yes.

I thought so.

MR. COLEMANs

Of course, the judge also is supposed

QUESTION:
to show it.

I said there is nothing in the record

The supposition is that he is trained as a

Virginia judge to do the same thing a jury does, and he does
it that way.
MR. COLEMAN:

If ha does it and he is familiar

with the law.
The question of finality that is being raised here,
I think, is an important one, because in so many other issues,
a person is not set free if we find 10 years later that
somebody didn't commit the crime because another person
confesses to it.

His remedy is executive clemency.

It seems

to me that in a State trial when the person has gone through
the trial and has appealed the matter and been found guilty,
that that should be the end of it.

42
So I would like to conclude by saying that while
I would urge the Court to consider the application of
Stone v. Powell» drawing the line as I have suggested on
these questions of sufficiency of the evidence on the theory
that if a job can be done once well, there is no reason to
do it twiceo

If the Court does not feel that it wants to

make that departure, clearly the rule of Thompson v. City of
Louisville is applicable and is not inconsistent with
In re winship.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have anything further,

Ms. Colville?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MS. CAROLYN J. COLVILLE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. COLVILLE:

Your Honor, just a very brief

statement about what exactly we are seeking.
We are seeking that there be a standard in habeas
corpus that if no rational trier of fact could have found
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, then the writ of habeas
corpus should issue.
In this particular case, we would ask either,that
the Court decide as to the facts of the case or that it be
remanded to the Fourth Circuit, who had already indicated it
had some doubts in its mind about the applicable law but without
further guidance feltthey had to apply Thompson .

We either

43

ask that the Court apply it to the facts of the case or remand
it for the Fourth Circuit to apply it»
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Ms. Colville, let me ask you one

question, if I might.
I suppose one could apply your standard to a trial
that took 20 days and had 80 witnesses and a transcript of
many thousands of pages.

Is the procedure you contemplate,

that would simply be submitted to the habeas judge for his
perusal or referral by him to a magistrate, if that was his
inclination?
MS. COLVILLE:

My basic inclination is that the

transcript would go to the Federal district judge.

He would

then have the benefit of the wisdom of the State court plus
any pleadings filed on behalf of the State.

He would then

look at those in order to swiftly review —»
QUESTION:

How would you swiftly review several

thousand pages?
MS. COLVILLE:

I think what I am saying is it would

be far easier if the State said this is where we say there is
reasonable doubt.

I think the court could then look at it

to see if indeed this does create reasonable doubt.

I think

/

it would be an easier process if they are being guided somewhat
as to where the State says the reasonable doubt exists.
QUESTION:

Like a sufficiency of evidence argument

44
on appeal, say, to the Supreme Court of Virginia.
MS. COLVILLE s
QUESTIONS

I

Certainly.

Ms. Colville, you have answered it, I

know, but I am just a little confused.

Is the standard you

propose the same as the standard that is applied in direct
review in Virginia?
MS. COLVILLEs

No, your Honor, I could not find that

reasonable doubt was the rule applied in Virginia, no.
QUESTION;

So it’s a somewhat narrower standard,

I would presume, then.
MS. COLVILLEs

Yes.

Thank you.
I

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
