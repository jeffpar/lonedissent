APPEARANCES z
[Same as heretofore noted. 3

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume in 837,

and, Mr. McCall, you have about five minutes remaining.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANES R. McCALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN 77-849 -- Resumed
MR. McCALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may if please

the Court:
At the close of Court yesterday I was discussing the
fact ■Ediat the private conduct which is authorized by the
California statute could in no sensa be considered a violation
of the antitrust law, because it does not involve conduct
which has been declared illegal under the antitrust laws,
Far from if, the conduct is protected by the Moerr™Pennin-gton
political action exception.
I also would stress that the Act itself, even if it
did authorize conduct which was not political action, which
could conceivably be hold to violate the antitrust laws but for
■Idie statute itself, would still constitute State action under
the test.
QUESTION:

Mr. McCall, are we as free in dealing with

an appeal from a judgment of a three-judge District Court to
considar a matter that was not passed on by a 'three-judge

24
District Court as we would be ir considering a petition for
certiorari in a Court of Appeals?
MR* McCALLs
Mr, Justice Rehnquisfc.

I must confess sore ignorance as to that,
I assume that is the case, but I did

not research that particular point.
Just quickly, because the point is made, I think, in
appellants* reply briefs, under the standards that this Court
has come down with in the five or six cases, really, in the
last four or five years, the conduct here of making a protest
to the Board would be clearly authorised by a State statute
exhibiting a clear intent to remove this operation of this
particular industry from "competition*9, and, therefore, from
the application of the Sherman Act, and there's a clear intent
in the statute to substitute State regulation.

As established,

I think, in the briefs, this.distinguishes it from Goldfara,
Catitor, Lafayette Power and the Schwegmann case of 1951.
QUESTION s

Do you agrne that the contract clause

issue is no longer in the case?
MR. McCALL:

Yes, I do.

1 would, in closing, like to make several general
comments about the Sherman Act issue here, and also the
commerce clause issue, which the appellees have tendered by
way of footnote.
I think that as far as the preemption issue is
concerned here, appellees5 argument has an Alice in Wonderland

25

quality to it®

You have a statute which dees not authorize

illegal conduct under the Sheman Act? and which does have
adequate State supervisions
To extend the idea —
QUESTION?

Mre McCall, on that question of adequate

State supervision, you said it’s just like these other cases
where the Parker v* Brown exception can apply, but here? what
kind of State

what does the State do other than to say that

the nearby dealers shall be protected from competition?

That3!?

all it says„
MR* McCALL:

Well, the statute provides that, of

course, there will be a Board hearing,

-..as to whether or not

there will be any permanent prohibition of putting in the new
franchise.

The State also controls the time during which

the temporary order will be in effect, because the Board can
hold ci hearing quickly or it can wait the full sixty days*
It must hold a hearing within sixty days.
QUESTIONs

But it’s just a yes-or~no situation,

either the new dealership can open or it can't, there's no
continuing regulatory supervision of any kind*
MR® McCALLs

That's correct*

That's correct*

There's no continuing ”«■»
QUESTION?

And the sole State interest is in

protecting the old dealer from additional competition, right?
MR® HeCALL:

I would phrase it slightly differently„

26

I think ifc*s to prevent overloading in a particular area.
QUESTION:

To prevent too much competition# in other

words.
MR. McCALLs

That might deprive consumers of

warranty facilities through business failure, and things of
that type# yes,

1 think —-

QUESTION:

You don’t describe this as protecting

consumers# do you?
MR. McCALLs
yes.

I think it is in part designed to that,

Certainly to the same extent the State of Maryland’s

law was in the Exxon case.
QUESTION:

But nothing in our opinion suggested

the State of Maryland law did anything for the consumer# did
it?
MR. McCALLs

It didn’t seem to be crucial to the

opinion# no.
I would lastly say that it seems to me that the
antitrust laws yoked with the supremacy clause is a poor
vehicle to be used to strike down statutes which may be
unpleasing to manufacturers.

Essentially# GM complains it’s
I

a bad law# and they don’t like it.
questionable.

X think that’s quite

Congress and other State Legislatures have

passed similar laws.
But the remedy in that case is not before this
Court# it is before the State Legislatures# and the automobile

27

manufacturers lack neither the sophistication nor the resources
to get an adequate hearing in the State Legislature0
1 would like to reserve whatever time we have left
for rebuttal»
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well®

Mr® Coleman, you may proceed whenever you're ready®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T® COLEMAN, JR®, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR® COLEMAN;

Good morning, Mr® Chief Justice®

May it please the Court;
The basic issue hare is whether, under th© Fourteenth
Amendment, a State may grant private individuals the unrestrained
use of State power to exclude selectively other private
individuals from enjoying the common occupations of life for
substantial periods of time®
Such a grant of State power to private individuals
ought to be particularly suspect, since, once .exercised,
%■

i

\

whether individually or collectively, it results in a horison™
tally opposed restraint on trade, long held, per se, legal,
under th© Sherman Antitrust Lew®
Now, let me make crystal-clear that appellants do
v
not challenge the power of the State to regulate business
activities within its borders through active State supervision,
What it does challenge is the ability of an existing
franchise dealer to use State power collectively, arbitrarily,

28

and capriciously to prevent other equally competent and
qualified franchise dealers from enjoying their franchisee
The existing franchise dealers can do this- because the State
issues, even though the statute is a for-cause statute, a
temporary injunction in favor of the existing dealer, without
any notice, any hearing, or even the slightest consideration
by any State official.
Such & total application of State power to private
individuals lies at the heart of the matter*.

11 ® s not only

unreasonable, I really submit it’s outrageous.
QUESTION:

Mr. Colemar, the throe-judge court in this

case, as x understood it, held that, and I think quite
clearly, perhaps implicitly# that the State could do precisely
this so long as sufficient procedural due process was afforded,
Isn’t that correct?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
In your opening statement I think you

posed the question as to whether or not the State .could do it
at all, with or without procedural due process.
MR,-'’ COLEMAN:

No, the State could net do it in

this snanner, where they put in the hands of private individuals
the uncontrolled power to keep another person out of business.
QUESTION:

Can’t do it at all or can’t do it

without?
ME. COLEMAN:

Wall, what you6re saying# Your Honor,

29

I think youed have a differant question»

If what yon®re

saying is that the State would determine that in California?
for example, there were a sufficient number of business
dealers, and we are not going to let any other business dealer
in, I think you*ve got a completely different question there»
But what wa claim here is the particular wrong, is
that the State abrogated its power and instead says, "We'll do
nothing, but if any private competitor, the one person that
has an interest adverse to the interest of the ether person,
objects, you then have this injunction issued.•
In other words, I'd like to say here that this ought
to be clear.

Under this statute, once General Motors entered

into the franchise agreement with Muller and Fox, and each of
them already had a Stats license, at that point, under this
statute, the State was powerless to do anything.
In the first place, if the franchise was set more
lb n ten miles —- not in the 314-mile area, no one could do
anything.

If it ware within this area, as you pointed out,

Justice Stevens, and no one objected, my clients had an
absolute right to open.

And it's only because there's some­

body in that area, which I think everybody here has to agree
has to be the one person that I cannot depend upon to give me
a fair, unbiased determination as to whether there is a
violation of the statute, that5a the one person that can
prevent me from going ahead with the fruits of my contract.

30
QUESTION?

Is that a constitutional argument you're

making?
MR. COLEMAN!
QUESTION?

Yes, sir.
Lack of procedural due process?

MR. COLEMAN:

Lack of procedural due process and a

State statute, No* 1j No. 2, a State statute which gives
private individuals the uncontrolled right to affect my
liberty. And that is strictly the Embank vs. Richmond case,
Your Honor, where the Court said there that you can't have a
statute which says that the landowners, if two-thirds of them
decide where the property line should be, that ends the matter.,
that's where you put the property line.
QUESTION:

Well, what if General Motors and your

client, or General Motors and the new franchisee have an
agrcKjnenfc to open up at a particular place, but it's soned
residentially?
MR. COLEMAN: Well, sir, we don't have that problem
hero because in this case the placeo which were selected were
already used as automobile places,
QUESTION:

Yes, but what if it were?

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, if you had a general lav/, a

general law applicable to everybody, not a law where only my
competitor can bring it into fores, and a law where, when he
brings it into force prior to any State hearing, he gets all
the relief that he's trying to gat.

And that's what the wrong

31
is here»
What you’re saying is, can you have a general statutet
a regulatory statute saying that in a particular area, if
you don’t —» if that doesn’t qualify, that there can be a
hearing or you could object, and the State independently
determines I will or I will not? that * s completely different»
QUESTION3 Well, you can get an immediate injunction,
can’t you, in most States if a person simply opens up a use
that is not _permitted under the zoning law?
MR» COLEMANj

Well, sir, based upon the wisdom of

your own rules, you don’t gat immediate injunctions in the
federal court» What you do is you file a piece of paper, you
file a pleading, you have an affidavit, and then the most
independent person of all, a federal district judge passes upon
that»

And I’ve won some and I’ve lost some, Your Honor»
QUESTIONS Wall, how about a State court?
MR» COLEMAN s

Well, I’m pretty sure that if any

State court reads Justice White’s opinion in 'the North Ga-orgi:
Finishing Company casa, I think that a State court ought to be
constitutionally under the same restrictions»

That’s what the

whole line of those cases is about»
QUESTION3

So your problem would be cured here if

the California law said that you can put in the dealership
unless some — unless there’s an objection filed»

If there’s

an objection filed, Wwe shall hold a hearing and you won’t be

32

prevented from putting it in until the hearing is over® and
if it goes against you.

Let's suppose that's the scheme0

They have the hearing and they decide that the objection is
valid, we're not going to permit another dealer in this, area®
Would your problem all be over?
MR® COLEMANs

Well, that's a different caseB

If what

you're saying is that if it were a statute under which, before
tha State power was exercised, that we obtained a hearing, than
obviously we could no longer argue the due process issue»
We may have other issues in the case, but we wouldn't have
this one»
QUESTIONS So your problem is devoted to the period
before there is a hearing and a State decision?
MR. COLEMAN:

That's right, yes.

QUESTION: Although, in ray example, the Stats
procedures would never be engaged unless some private party
filed an objection.
MR. COLEMAN: Well, I think that's a more difficult
ease,

1 think that what usually happens, I think that the

statute ought to read -that a State, independently or upon
objections — I mean, you know, for example, inhere most
statutes say that if you file and someone has standing and in
due course makes an objection, or the State independently,
and I think that one of the wrongs in this statute is the
State independently can never act, that it can only act if a

33

competitor comes on„

1 think that it's clear in this case

since there is no hearing? that under your cases of this
Court? that the statute is clearly unconstitutional.

If you

say there is a hearing? then obviously you don’t have the
constitutional issue? but you might have other issues? if
you say that there will only be a hearing if a competitor is
the one that asks for the hearing,

I just think that’s a

different case.
With respect to Fox? the record is clear that Fox
had a franchise agreement? he had a license? all he wanted to
do was to add another line to the place? the place of business
It’s equally clear that under State law? having the license?
his only duty was to indicate to the State officials where
the location was going to be.
him an entitlement.

At that point the State gave

He had the right to go forward.

And

the only thing that prevented him from going forward was this
particular statute? enacted lately? which said? KWe’ll wait?
if a compatitor objects? you can’t go forward,*
He doesn’t have to give ma any reason whatsoever?
all he has to file —* if you look at the record on page 77?
you will see the objection.

It just says *1 object**.

And

based upon that? Fox was held up for over eleven months,
lost an entire season of sale.
We think that’s what is wrong with this statute.
I think X made it clear as to what I think the

He

34

liberty interest is»

I think that every American citizen has

an absolute, right to go into business and he or she cannot be
interfered with; except under a State statute which either
regulates somebody generally, applying to every one, or one
which first applies for a type of hearing»
QUESTIONs

Now, you rely for your basic constitutional

liberty upon cases -such as Mayer v, Nebraska, don't you?
MR® COLEMAN 3

Among ten or twelve others we have

cited»
QUESTION:

Well, among tan or twelve others»

It

was that case that the three-judge court particularly relied
ox?.»

And in that case the Court held that all the hearings in

the world wouldn't have made that statute valid.

That wasn't

a procedural due process case, was it?
MR» COLEMAN:

That’s right, Your Honor.

You have

•made the point I've been trying to make dramatically better
than you can -« with all due respect.

Wall, Justice Rehnquist

at some time said that because after Meyer a statute permits a
certain type of substantive regulation, that means that Meyer
has been overruled, and there’s no liberty interest»

It doesn’t,

it just means that there9s still a liberty interest, but the
Court will permit State action to affect that»
But what we5 re saying is that one way you can
affect it, in this type of statute applying only to a competitor,
is without requiring a hearing.

35
QUESTIONS But the Meyer case and that line of cases,
Fierce y. -SocM::;~ of Sisters, and so cm, those are not
procedural due process cases*
MR. COLEMAN s

That’s right. We use Meyer only to

establish that we have a liberty,
QUESTION^

Those cases held that the State couldn’t

dc what it did at all, with all the hearings in the world, it
still couldrt* t do it*
MR. COLEMAN:

Right.

That’s right.

because the person had a liberty interest.

For one reason,

And we say that

once you recognize that a liberty interest, then they can’t
do what they wanted to do hare without a certain type of
hearing.
We also say we have an entitlement, and Justice
Powell, in his opinion in the Arnett v* Kennedy case, ones
again said that once you establish, either by the Constitution
or by statute, that you have an entitlement ~ and Justice
Brennan, you in the Goldberg ease

once you establish -that,

then you have the right to say that the State cannot affect
that without granting ms a hearing* And even though Justice
Rehnquist would say, and I think erroneously, -that if that
State — if the same statute like in Arnett says to have
hearings, but a different type of hearing, that somehow you
read that back in to cut down on the liberty or entitlement.,»
Fortunately for me, six members of this Court have

36

held to the contrary, and I think, for that reason, that once
I convince you that there is a liberty interest, then you have
to determine:

can this type of liberty interest b© taken

away by a competitor without a hearing?

Once 1 demonstrate

that there is an entitlement under the license, that I
demonstrate to you that here the State license gave my client,
including General Motors, this right, can that right be
affected, not by the State acting independently but by a
private competitor, without

my first getting a hearing?

1 don't think I have to argue the question of the
hearing, because here there was no hearing at all®
QUESTION:

Mr® Coleman, just to foe sure I understand

your submission, I take it you emphasise the absence of any
governmental participation prior to the adverse impact on the
liberty interest which you claim?
MR., COLEMAN5
QUESTION:

Yes, air,
Which, if I understand you correctly,

would mean that your argument would not cast any doubt on the
validifcy of a statute which flatly prohibited new dealerships
within the ten~ndle radius of

old dealerships?

Or,

alternatively, a statute which said you cannot open a new
dealership without getting permission from an appropriate
licensing agency, or something like that, and where you apply
to a State agency for a new dealership?
MR® COLEMANi

Well, I think —

37
QUESTION:

Either of those would be safe tinder your

argument?
MR, COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

MR. COLEMAN:

I say they are different problems«
But I'm saying your

argument wouldn't —«

My argument would not go to that, and

I must be — because I'm affected greatly by Justice Brandeis*;
opinion -» I mean, pardon roe, Justice Brennan's opinion in
?
?
Duval vs, Bursey case,
The first paragraph of that opinion
says:

If you had a State statute which said that anybody that

wanted to drive a car had to have automobile insurance, that
statute would probably he constitutional.

But if the State

statute doesn't do that, and say that you drive and you don't
have insurance, that if.you thereafter get in an accident and
if you don't pay up at a certain time, and therefore it's at
fault, that we're going to keep you from enjoying this license,
then, under those circumstances, you first have to have some
iyp:3

i> f

hearing.
So we would have to say here that obviously if you

drew a different statute, we'd have a different problem.

But

we think under this statute you don't have that type of problem,
and it's clear that the State isn't thinking about barring
all the automobile dealers.

What it did was to put in the

hands of the competitor this type of action, which we think is
clearly unconstitufcional.
Nov?, I would next like to turn to the antitrust and

supremacy arguments0
QUESTIONs

Let me ask you one other question*, if I
Could we view this statute as the

equivalent of creating a legislative or statutory presumption
that every new dealership within ten miles of an old dealer­
ship is contrary to State policy in some way?
MR® COLEMANs
QUESTIONS

No* sir.
And why not?

MR® COLEMANs Simply because,, under those facts* if
you open up and a dealer within that area doesn't do anything*
the State is powerless to act»
QUESTIONS

Is there experience under the statute as

to hew most of these disputes are resolved?
MR* COLEMAN:

decision, that there should foe an additional dealer nailing
Buicks?

The statute says 314 miles.

Don®t you realise that

every city —* that means that you can block people from going
to any city more than once, other than Los Angeles and San
Diego.

Those are the only two cities.
QUESTION; Well, do you think a State could have a

general statute, Justice Stevens asked you about «- you can*t

QUESTION:

Before you go on, Nr, Coleman, would

you say it*s beyond the State power, taking Justice White's
illustration in part, to say there must be a ninety-day
waiting period while the State or the local authority as its
surrogate checks into the; traffic patterns, possible increased
air pollution because of the grtater frequency of cars and
so forth? would that ba unreasonable?
MR, COLEMAN: Well, that would be a completely
different statute,

And if what you're saying is that if the

State had said that before anybody could go into business,
you have to fils a place of paper with the State, and the
State, for a certain period of time, will suspend any hearing

bocr.rne we live in an organised society where it takes time
to decide sore?-.thing, you have fee recognize that public
officials can't act the next day.

statute of general application, and I think that makes all the
difference in the world,

not being more forthcoming to you than I normally would be,
sir, I've had experience in this field, end you just don’t
get statutes drawn that simply* And I*d have to read the
statute*

I don't want anybody to say that I've conceded that

any statute “**
QUESTIONs Well, I know*

But you would concede,

wouldn't you, that your present argument would not apply to
that statute?
MR* COLEMAN:
different case*

That's right.

I’d say that’s a

It may be GM will get a different lawyer to

argue that one, but on this particular one, that’s not my

45
problem, mid I think that’s a completely different ease.
As X said, I’d like to turn to the antitrust and
supremacy argument.
GM entered into an agreement with Fox to sell
Buicks. After reviewing the facts and making a determination
that the Pasadena location would comply with Section 3063
of the Act.

But two competing dealers, who also had a GM

agreement, jointly protested.

The Act conferred upon them

the power, without any independent State decision, to prevent
Fov?, as a competing dealer, from locating in the territory
because it is within the 314-mila area.
And, Mr# Justice Marshall, whan you indicated that
there was an umpire plan,. that. has. been, changed# and-it was.

•

■

changed because of, in part, the decision of the Third
Circuit in the Holiday Inn case, and GM felt that perhaps'it
might be a problem if you would permit some of the existing
dealers to object to a n&w dealer coming in. And so, therefore,
with respect to this type of decision, there is not an umpire
plan.
But that is the reason why it sasras that this
statute has to be bad, because if you say that GM with its
dealers cannot make this type of arrangement, then clearly a
corseting dealer, merely by saying ”1 protest”, ought not,
for a period of ninety days to a year and a half, to be able
to impose what is basically a horizontal trade restraint.

46
As 1 understand the law, the Sherman Act says that
any statute, State statute, which permits a private competitor
to d© this is invalid.
Sehwegmann says.

That*s what I think your decision in

Xn Schwegmenn, the liquor distributor

had

a valid contract for retail price maintenance with seme local
retailers«
The Louisiana statute, however, attempted to am
a private competitor with the ability to extend this contract
by making such price-fixing snforcible against non*»signing
retailers.

Because this extension conflicted with basic

antitrust principles, the Louisiana statute was preempted by
the Sherman Act,
In Schwegmenne this Court never inquired into whether
any private individual had violated the antitrust law.

For

all horizontally imposed restrictions to restrain trad© are
patently pernicious and are per a© violations of the federal
antitrust laws,
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Coleman, don’t you have a.

problem with the fast that here, if there1 a an agreement
between the existing dealer who objecto and General Motors,
the agreement is one which permits the new company, the new
dealership to open. Th© existing dealer can object without
agreeing with anybody,

So where do you gat the conspiracy

element of the Sherman antitrust law?

MR. COLEMAN z

But you. do, sir, th® same way in

47
Schwegmann.

The fact is that you have a State statute which

permits —
QUESTION: But that gave effect -to a vertical agree­
ment between the liquor company and ita wholesaler or ifc3
retailer.

Thera was an underlying agreement there,, which you

don’t have here.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, sir, what you have here, you

have a State statute which permits an individual to bring about
the same type of conduct —
QUESTION'S

That acting alone «-

MR. COLEMAN:

-*» that normally he could only bring

about.by way of an agreement.

And, you know, suppose you had

a State statute which says —
QUESTIONs

What you*re saying is a State statute

replaces the conspiracy element of the Sherman Act?
MR. COLEMAN:

That’s right, because it permits the

private individual, acting by himself, to bring about, exactly
the same result that otherwise *—
QUESTION:

I don’t think that any case has so held.

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTIONs

Well, I think —
Schwegmann, as I say, had a two-party

agreement in it.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I would ask you to re-read

Schwecmann, because I think that Schwegmann doss not depend
upon any agreement which has in any way been determined to be

43
illegal or improper.
What Sehwecptann says is that you canf t use State
power to bring about exactly the same results that otherwise
you could bring about only by an agreement, And I think that
the only thing that would save this statute would be the so»»
called; Parker doctrine, but if there's anything clear from
Cantor and your cases decided in the last two or three years,
it is that the State has to do some thing in terms of active
supervision before you say the Parker doctrine is applicable.
And here there is no active supervision whatsoever,
I didn't think 1 was going to get this

far without

Justice White asking me about 'the question he hased the other
r

day about this question of whether, sines we raised both issue??
below, and now the Court passed upon one constitutional issue,
is there any problem with respect to the other,
I think, under tea cases
?

I think the cases you
?

were referring to was Hogan vs, Levin, and as 1 read that case,,
or somebody read it for ms last night and then

1

read it this

morning, that case says that both issues were constitutional
issues.

Also what we're asking here is only what the Court

did in Ohio Bureau of Employment vs, Hodary, which is 431 U,S.
QUESTION;

But haven't we said three™judge courts

would normally reach the supremacy clause issue first?
MR, COLEMAN:

I don't think that's what you said.

But if they don't wish to reach it first, and they decide the

49

other issue, when they were both submitted -*- and her® they are
?
both constitutional issues, which, in Hagan you indicated
that there*s — and we submitted both of them, and we argued
both of them equally as vigorously.
Now, if the Court says -- as I look at the constitu­
tional cases, dealing with.the due process, that’s so clear
that X will resolve it on that basis, they give us the
injunction, and X don’t ss© how we can do anything else but
accept it and wait, hoping that nobody will take
QUESTION: Well, if we disagree with you on your
first submission, what should we do with your supremacy clause
issue, remand it?
HR. COLEMAN:
resolve it here.

No, sir, I think that you should

is clejar, and iny understanding is that’s what you did in

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr* Mukai.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. MUKAI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 17-83?
MR. MUKAI:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
to. Coleman suggested that the Schwegmann decision
relieved th© appellees of the necessity of demonstrating at

50

least some conduct violative of the federal antitrust laws»
I would ask the Court to refer to page 386 of that
decision, reported in 341 U.S., in which Justice Douglas
unequivocally stated that the scheme there questioned would be
illegal,, would be enjoined, and would draw civil and criminal
penalties, and that no court would enforce it»
And that was the Louisiana statute which was struck
down by this Court in Schwegroann.
So it is our submission that Schwagmann cannot
relieve the appellees of stating an antitrust claim without
showing predicate facts necessary to make out a violation of
some federal antitrust statute„
With the Covxrt*s permission, Mr» Coleman has pointed
out, or has characterized a right existing in appellees which
depend, in large part, upon the view that the license granted
to a dealer provides him with some unassailable right to locato
wherever ha wants.

In effect, Mr. Coleman posits a portable

property interest in the dealer, which he cannot be deprived
of without a due process hearing.
This characterisation is mistaken because a fixed
geographical location is integral to the initial issuance and
the continued entitlement to a dealer license under California
law.
In Section 11712 of the California Vehicle Code,
the Department of Motor Vehicles, the licensing authority, is

prohibited from issuing a dealer license to an applicant
without an established place of business»
Section 11721 requires the automatic cancellation
of a dealer license whenever a dealer abandons an established
place of business*

Section 11713 makes it a violation of the

Coda not to maintain an established place of business e and
Section 40000,11 makes that violation a misdemeanor under fcha
California law.
Your Honors, I sea that my time has expired, and 1
thank -the Court for its attention,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
........ [Whereupon, at 10:42 a«m.f the case in the 'above- '
entitled matters was submitted,!
