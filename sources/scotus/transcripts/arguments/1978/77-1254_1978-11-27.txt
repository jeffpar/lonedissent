MR. QIIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 1254, Vance, the Secretary of State,
against Bradley.
Mr., Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you9 re
ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE II» McCREE, JR. , ESQ.,
OR BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This appeal presents the question:

Whether Section-

632 of the Foreign Service Act of 1945, which requires that
persons covered by the Foreign Service Retirement System to
retire at ago 60, violate.:* the equal protection component of

the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution?
Appellees are six former and four current Foreign
Service employees in the Department of State or the International Communications Agency, formerly the United States
Information Service, and an organisation representing such
employees.

They filed this action to challenge the validity

of the Act.

They make statutory as well as constitutional

claims, end «ought a declaration of invalidity, injunctive
relief, back pay and reinstatement.
The district court dismissed the primary nonconstitu­
tional claims, including the Age Discrimination in Employment

4
claim? and appellees abandoned the remaining nonconstitutional
claimso
A three-judge court was then convened to consider
the constitutional contentions.
Appellants contended that the constitutional issue
was a question of law, and moved for summary judgment.
Appellees argue that the resolution of the constitutional issu
required the presentation of evidence, to show that there was
no rational basis for distinguishing between Foreign Service
employees, who must retire at age 60, and Civil Service
employees who, at that time, could continue to work until
age 70,
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, what is the presen

retirement age for a general officer in the military service,
if you know?
MR, McCJREE:

Iem unable to furnish that information

if the Court please.
QUESTION:

It is less than 70, though?

MR. McCREE:

There is a compulsory retirement age,

and it is less than 70„

As a. matter

of fact, the Armed

Services have — well, at least on the naval side — have an
up-or-out program, and a person is retired or selected out
if he isn't promoted within a certain number of years.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

hit: a given age.
At a given age,,

5
This Court considered that in Schlesinqer vs,
Ballard not very long ago,

7md upheld in that case a dis­

tinction between male and female officers»

Male officers# I

believe# had to move up or out after nine years in grade#
and female officers 13 years*

And this Court found that there

was a sufficient difference i.n their circumstances# because of
the different nature of assignments; so that the female officer
had fewer chances for promotion and therefore she might be
given 13 years in grade instead of nine.
And of course that impinges upon the Issue here# as
we will argue subsequently.
At the time this action was brought# Civil Service
*

employees were required to retire at age 70# but on April 6#
1978# Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act. amendments of 1978# repealing the statute requiring most
civil servants to retire at age 70.

And currently# effective

September 30, 1978# there is no compulsory retirement age for
most civil servants.
QUESTION;

Does that mean that if this Court were

to affirm the judgment of the district court there would simply
be no retirement age for Foreign Service officers?
MR,, McCREE:
QUESTION;

It would appear that that would follow.
We certainly couldn*t substitute w70”

out of the air# I take it# if there is no congressional 70-year*
old requirement at the present time.

6
MR0 MeCREE a

Well, that's certainly so» The court

below thought at one time that a challenge was made to age 60,
but that appellees would accept age 70j and in fact, in a
footnote, the court indicated that it was satisfied that an
age

70 mandatory retirement for Foreign Service officers

would be valido
QUESTION?

This wasn't a settlement conference, though,

I take it?
MR® McCREEs
QUESTION;

Pardon me?
This wasn't a settlement conference, I

take it, it was with —
MR., McCREEs

Oh, no, this was in the court's opinio;»

It later struck from its opinion the footnote that indicated
that appellees had failed to show that age 70 was not ratioially related to a legitimate government purpose, although i
had held that age 60 was not rationally related,

But after

the amendment: came along, it struck this portion of its
footnote and now, as She court suggests, s Foreign Service
officer or other persons in the Foreign Service Retirement
Program apparently would have indefinite service, as do other
civi1 sa rvants„
QUESTION;

Tour sister on the other tside, Mrs,

Hostetler, disagrees with that, at least in the brief —
disagrees with that conclusion, at least in her brief»
MR», McCREE;

That they would have indefinite

7
service?
QUESTIONS

Yesa

her perhaps on this,

As I read it»

We can hear from

Perhaps I misunderstood, it,

MR, MeCREEs

I believe I recall that# but it would

seem logical to me that# as fir. Justice Kehnquist has suggested#
we couldn't pull age 70 out of the air —
QUESTIONS

Right,

MR„ McCREEs

— and impose it.

On the basis of affidavits from both sides and
submissions in response to the court's request for supplementa­
tion of the record# the court treated the case as if it had
been submitted on cross“notions for summary judgment# and
declared the mandatory retirement provision unconstitutional.
We submit that the court correctly recognised that
neither fundamental rights nor suspect classes are involved
in the distinction between Foreign Service employees and
Civil Service employees# and that therefore the rational basis
test is the appropriate one.

And that the statute# therefore#

is presumptively valid# and the challengers have a heavy burdei
of proving invalidity.
Nevertheless# although it applied# as we suggest#
the proper standard# the court held# "on the record established
in this case,, the early mandatory retirement cannot survive
even this minimal scrutiny,R
This court# in considering the proffered justifica-

8

tions, first,, chat the special stresses and unique burden of
employment in the Foreign Service is the result of frequent
and extensive changes in environment, often accompanied by
exposure to unfamiliar and unfavorable living conditions, and,
second, the implementation that it afforded to the personnel
management program for'Foreign Service officers, did not
discuss the legislative history at all, of these two purposes?
but made its own assessment of the employment conditions of
Foreign Service and Civil. Service employees,
/

And in doing so, it concluded that "less than ten
percent of the American civilians who work overseas for the
government are forced to retire at age sixty” and that many
of the overseas personnel not subject f.o mandatory retirement
have jobs similar to those of the Foreign Service personnel,
and may be stationed also in hardship posts.
Accordingly, it held, upon this determination, that
a system under which some federal employees working abroad are
singled out for early retirement is "patently arbitrary and
irrational" and it invalidated the legislation.
We contend that the district court erred in not
considering the legislative history and in substituting its
judgment for the decision of the Congress to create a separate
Foreign Service with its own combination of benefits and
obligations,
QUESTION?

Mr, Solicitor General, did I miss it?

9
AID discussed here at all?
MR. McCREEs

Yes,, if the Court please.

for International Development is involved in the Foreign. Servi;;
Retirement Act®

MR, McCREEs

Right,

United States

Agency , and the Foreign Service
QUESTIONS
MR, McCREEs

But AID is also in there?
Yea, if the Court please.

QUESTION? And it includes all of the — or at least
many of the staff jobs,, the secretarial jobst. the jobs like
thatc doesn’t it?
MR,, McCREEs

It now includes them as well as the

Foreign Service officers, persons with officer grade or
reserve officer grade as well.
This Court held in. Usezy vs. Turner, hiper 6 Minev(?)
that the constitutionality of an Act of Congress ms> Le
sustained by looking solely to concerns expressed in the
congressional hearings and debates.

Because in that case

the three*»judge court refused to accept evidence, and this
Court satisfied itself with the rational relationship by
merely looking at the congressional history.
This Court also, in Whalen vs. Roe in 197?»
considered a challenge to a New York drug prescription compute"

10

scheme*

That was a schema under which a physician, dispensing

certain Schedule II drugs, which, were opium derivatives and
cocaine, was required to prepare in triplicate a report
indicating the name of the physician who prescribed the drug,
the name and address of the patient, and the quantity of the
drug prescribed, and then to turn this over to the State
Government., which then would place it into a computer bank,
and the intention was to determine whether there was a
recurrence of prescription by certain physicians, or the
filling of prescriptions unduly by certain pharmacists, or
the acquisition of narcotics by certain patients*
This was challenged, and the Court said this

%

that

the State*s interest in the control of narcotic drugs is
valid, and the schema is reasonably related, and the fact
that the district court held that the State had failed to
demonstrate -shat it was working was not invalidated; it said
it was enough to see that there was a rational relationship
between the scheme and the objective, which was the control
of the narcotics traffic*
'QUESTIONs

But, Mr. Solicitor General, that wasn't

an equal protection case*
MR* McCREEs

It was not an equal protection case,

but it is illustrative, we submit here, in shewing that the
failure of proof to show that a scheme works doesn't destroy
a determination that it's rational and doesn’t therefore requii

11
the Court to invalidate it.
And ttiat seems to be what happened here, The district
court entertained evidence and determined that large numbers
of civil servants were living abroad under circumstances which
it found indistinguishable, at least legally indistincfuishabls
from those of the Foreign Service people who are under this
mandatory retirement? .and, for that reason, determined that
there was no rationality to the program.
We suggest that if the rationality is demonstrated,
evidence that it doesn’t include everyone or that it might be
done in another way, or that it just doesn't work, doe3 not
invalidate it.
As a matter of fact, in Whalen vs. Roe, the Court

quotes from Mr. Justice Brandsis,

who suggests that the States

must, be gives» latitude to experiment in methods of solving the
problems with which it;s confronted.

And if the program is

\

rationally related, the State should be given an opportunity
to see whether it works, and it shouldn't be invalidated just
because it cannot demonstrate on a challenge that it is working.
Another quotation from that, if I may,"the New York
statute challenged in this case presents a considered attempt
to deal with such a problem; it is manifestly the product of
an orderly and rational legislative decision»*
And wa submit that the language "it is manifestly
the product" . means that this Court will apply its experience

12

arid its general knowledge to determine rationality, and it
doesa®t require evidentiary proof of a relationship,,

But that

is exactly what the court below did in substituting its
j udgrnent *
The legislative history of this provision goes back
to 1924, when a single Foreign Service was first established.
The Foreign Service Act of 1924, sometimes known as the Rogers
Act because of Congressman Rogers, I believe of Massachusetts,
who was its principal sponsor. And since this is the only
direct legislative history, I would ask the indulgence

of the

Court to permit me to read from a colloquy on the Floor of
the House of Representatives, when the principal sponsor of
the 1924 legislation, Representative Rogers, explained that
Foreign Service officers would be required to retire five

years earlier, at that time age 65, than Civil Service
employees who, just four years earlier, were first brought
under a mandatory retirement at age 70.

Because, as he said,

Foreign Service officers, like military personnel, but unlike
most Civil Service employees, commonly were rotated among
remote posts overseas and frequently experienced disruptive
changes in their way of life.
Mr, Rogers said, *1 think the analogy of the Foreign
Service officer to the Army officer and to the naval officer
is much more complete than to the Civil Service employee in
Washington,

The Foreign Service officer is going hither and

13

yon about the worlds giving up fixed places of abode, often
rendering difficult mid hazardous service of prime importance
to the United Statesa”
QUESTIONS

But a good many things have happened,

both in the world and in our country, since 1924, haven’t they?
Both in terms of

where Civil Service employees might be

employed, that is, where they might be located in their
employment, «ind also in terms of developments like airconditioning, fast transportation and communication and so on.
MR,, McCREEs

That’s exactly so, and in fact the

location of hardship posts have changed, but there are still
hardship posts.

One of the changes that has occurred, of

course, is the emergence of the new nations, principally in
Africa, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and which normally did not have
members of our Foreign Service, because they would attend the
seat of government of the nation that lad colonized these now
emerged nations.
QUESTION %

We would have consular officers in those

colonies and protectorates, wouldn't we?
MR. McCREEs

To the extent that there was commerce

and intercourse with those nations to justify it? but —* with
these colonics to justify it.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREEj

Yes.
But just as what might have been a

hardship post in 1924, when Representative Rogers spoke, is

14
now in those new posts which nay even present more hardships,
Isd also like -~
QUESTlONs

In any event, Mr, Solicitor General, are

those considerations which we are entitled to take into
account, or tire those considerations for the Congress?
MR, McCREEs

Well, Mr, Chief Justice, you anticipated

my very next remark,
QUESTIONs Excuse me,
MR,, McCREE 2

I was going to — I thank you for it —

I was going to suggest that in Schiesinger vs, Ballard, the
case that we earlier discussed involving the naval officers,
in footnote 12, which is the very last footnote to the opinion
of the Court, the Court says exactly that, that it*s for the
Congress to decide when conditions no longer justify a
distinction that was valid at the time it was imposed.
And we

would submi t that that is peculiarly a

legislative judgment to be made,
QUESTION2

Mr, Solicitor General, can I pursue this

a moment, because you really are raising quite a fundamental
point, that X am not sure the Court has ever squarely address®da
Do you suggest that the test to the constitutionality
of the statute is totally dependent on the conditions at the
time the statute was enacted, or is it conceivable, say in
the area of sex discrimination, that a discrimination that was
perfectly reasonable when adopted -- because very few woman

15
worked, for example — might, 75 years later, be totally
irrational because there*3 no distinction any more in employ­
ment?

Could a statute which was originally reasonable, or

satisfied equal protection principles, become unconstitutional
merely by the passage of time?
MR0 McCKEEs

Well, I would have to concede the

possibility that it might, But I think, unless it was mani­
festly unconstitutional, —
QUESTIOMs

Wall, as soon as you6ve conceded that,

then aren6t we just confined to looking at rationality as of
today?

Because if it93 totally irrational, why, then, of

course, it5s bad whenever the irrationality arises, if I
understand you correctly,
MRo McCREE:

Wall, I think if there is any question

whether it still bears a rational relationship, we must then
indulge the Congress's right to make that determinatione
I think only when we would find that it was irrational, that
it bore no relationship? but, in that event, 1 would agree
with the Court, that the Court could make the determination
itself»
But we suggest 'that, here that isn't so at all,
because ~
QUESTIONS Well, I understand that®
be sure I've your position clearly in mind0

But let me just
You do concede

that if the Court concluded that today the statute was

16
irrational, than you would loss?
MR„ McCHEEs
QUESTION $
MR« McCREEs

Oh, I think I would have to lose»
Yes» All right.
But I would say that it would have to

be manifestly so, and the Congress — and the Court would have
to conclude that its rationality could not be maintained on
any basis at all, such as the Court said in McGowan vs.
Maryland, it would have to —- particularly in a case like this
where we®.re using --- where we don®t have a fundamental right
involved, nor do we have a suspect class involved.
QUESTION:

In that analysis, Mr. Solicitor General,

made by the Court in the consideration of the case, would the
Court **« should the Court take into account that Congress is
indicating a very great alertness in recent years to age
discrimination, gender discrimination, and other such
factors, with a view to -MR. McCREE:

Oh, I would agree that this is some­

thing of which the Court should take notice, just as I suggeste
that the Court should have looked at the earlier legislative
history of this.
However, if it did look, it would see that in -the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act the Foreign Service was
excluded from the lifting of the age 70 ceiling»
Now, there is soma suggestion that perhaps it was
excluded because there was some haste in getting the matter

1?

through the Congress, and they didn’t want to route it through,
a Committee different — the Foreign Service Committee, which
would be a committee different from the committee that
considered the Age Discrimination in Employment Act amendments ?
but it’s significant that the Congress did accept and did
recognise that it was still different®
QUESTION s General McCree, following up on my brother
Stevens® question, if we are to consider rationality or
irrationality as of the present day, are we then entitled to
take into consideration the subsequent legislation by Congress
such as the up-or-out promotional system which was not a part
of the enactment in 1924, but certainly if you put it in the
matrix of the present day, is a part of the Foreign Service
law in determining rationality?
MR® McCHEEs

Thank you for the question® And I would

certainly say yes, the Court should take that into consideration
That was the second justification that was offered to the threejudge court, that this implemented the up-or-out program that
the Foreign Service uses®
That also would indicate that it still has — that
it still bore a rational relationship to a legitimate aim®
QUESTION:
with your permission®

General, if I could back up a minute,
If there wars a showing that there were

no more ^hardship" posts in the future, the statute goes out'*
Would that be a change of sufficiency?

18

MR* McCRESs

That would be a significant change,

but there might be other factors, factors other than just being
stationed in a hardship post. One of 'the factors might be the
recurrence of change, the fact that a person could hardly
sink his roots in one place *—
QUESTION?

!*d hate to see the statistics of the

number of people that change their town for employment purposes
now as compared to e24a
MR* McGHEE*

That is so.

We would suggest that

perhaps the difference!! within the United States
QUESTIONs

I mean, they movedwhole departments of

Civil Service! employees to Mississippi last year.
MR, McCRESs

I would certainly agree with the Court

that that is the phenomenon of our current lifestyle, but I
would suggest that being moved from one continent to another
or being subject to removal is a more traumatic upheaval.
QUESTIONS

I don't see any difference in moving

from one swimming pool to another one.
MR. McCREEs

If those were the circumstances

attendant to all posts\ the news recently has had a sensational
story and a very tragic story that included the death of a
member of the

Congress investigating a situation in Guyana,

one of the recently emerged nations in South America.

With

Congressman Ryan and shot was Richard Dwyer, who was age 47,
was under the mandatory retirement age considerably, and he

19

was the Deputy Chief of Mission in Georgetown, and his; duties
required him to accompany persons to dangerous sites , and
he had, we presume, the vigor of a person 47 years old, and
was subjected to this risk of his life» And so we would
submit that the day of the hardship posts, the day of the
extraordinary risk, the day of the exposure to more than
ordinary civil service experience has not passed»
QUESTIONS

But terrorism, vulnerability to terrorism

doesn't have much to do with chronological age, does it?
MRo McCREEs

It does not, and the Court reminds me

that at the last Olympiad there was a terrorist incident»
Bui: we suggest that that is further evidence that
there is a rational relationship of having persons with the
physical vigor and stamina to be able to rise to these
problems, which can occur any place, because one would hardly
call Munich a hardship pest in terms of the creature

comforts

that it affords»
If the Court please, I believe I have about two
minutes left, and I would like to reserve that for rebuttal,
if I may»

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS, ZONA F» HOSTETLER, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRSo HOSTETLERs

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case turns on facts»

It presents one simple

narrow issue to this Court, and that iss

Was the com.!; below,

which studied 'die facto, wrong when it concluded that there9s
no rational basis for mandatorily retiring before age 70 the
particular group of white-collar employees involved in this
case?
QUESTIONS Do you think that court was in any better
position to make that evaluation than we are now?
MRS„ HOSTETLERs

Well, it*3 certainly within the

prerogative of this Court to review the record and to determine
whether the court below was mistaken; but that —
QUESTIONs

What I!m trying to get *it is whether the

review here is any different from the review, in quotation
marks, made by that court?
MRS* HOSTETLER:

No, but I submit that the facts will

show, if this Court looks at those facts, that there is in
fact no rational basis for the statute at issue»
And, Mr» Justice Burger, you inquired about the
Armed Forces,,

I want to make it very clear that all that is

involved in this case is the question of whether this particu­
lar group of white-collar office workers are unable to perform

21

the particular jobs that they are assigned in the Foreign
Service between the ages of SO and /0, or are less 'co perforin
them than are1, employees under the age of 6Q„
To affirm the court's decision below will not
require this Court to upset its decision in Murgia. nor will
it require this Court to hold that mandatory retirement can
never be applied to people such as the uniformed policemen in.
Murqia, who have physical jobs and for whom an earlier
mandatory retirement age can be said to have a rational basis
to the particular job 'that they have to performs
And certainly in the Armed Forces we all know that
our military men and women must be in combat"readiness and
must be either fighting wars or prepared to fight wars„
I might point out, however, that in the Defense
Department, «ill of the civilian employees, large numbers of
whom travel throughout the world and, in fact, spend 15, 20 and
25 years in service overseas, are not subject to early mandatory
retirement, but in fact are treated as Civil Service employees.
Mr, Justice Rehnquisfc, to refer to the point you
raised with Mr, Solicitor General, this case will raise only
the issue of whether the employees in the Foreign Service
between 'she ages of SO and

70 were able to perform the work

of the Foreign Service, the court below asked us on several
occasions whether we were claiming that mandatory retirement
at any age is unconstitutional! and we made it very clear that

22
we were not making that claim.
And the evidence that we submitted went primarily
to show that employees between the ages of 60 and 70 are able
to perform the particular jobs of the Foreign Service.

We

really did not try to introduce evidence or to make the argument that employees over the age of 70 can also perform that
work.

I think that argues —
QUESTIONs

Well# Mrs. Hostetlerf what then is the

state of the law if this Court affirms the judgment of the
district court?

Are Foreign service officers required by law

to retire at 70 now?

And if so, by what law?

MRS. HOSTETLER2

No. The court's order below has

been stayed find so at the present time they are still required
to retire at age 60.
QUESTION: Well? I presume if we affirmed if,, we would
dissolve the stay.

So that if it were affirmed and the

litigation was closed, would they be required by law to
require —
MRS. HOSTETLERs

I don't believe so, because the

court below very clearly said in its opinion that the Foreign
Service could not retire employees before the age of 70,
that they were entitled to work until age 70.
QUESTIONS But what —
MRS. HOSTETLER2

The court’s opinion below doesn't

say that they may work after 70.

23
QUESTIONs

But is the right of a Civil Service

employee to work or not to v?ork in the face of a congressional
proscription or mandatory retirement dependent on the opinion
of a three-judge district court?
MRS» HQSTETLISRs

If it is affirmed by the Supreme

Court„
QUESTIONS

But this was a constitutional attack,

at least as it survived here*
MRS * HOSTETLERS
QUESTIONs

That's right,

Originally there were some statutory

issues, but now it's purely based upon the so-called equal
protection component of the Fifth Amendment*

And that attack

must be that Foreign Service officers and Civil Service
officere are equivalent and therefore it

violates the

Constitution for the Congress to treat them differently,
MRS * HOSTETLER:

Well, there are —

QUESTIONs And if they are equivalent, where does the:
age 70 then come into the picture, now that Congress has
repealed that with respect to Civil Service employees?
MRS* HOSTETLER3

Well, there are Civil Service

employees who are required to retire before age — that are
still mandatorily required, to retire.

Law enforcement

personae:!, for example? air traffic controllers, for example.
In other words, the question turns on the particulai
job and whether or not there is a rational basis.

Now, it is

24
true that there will still he left open for a constitutional
litigation another day whether Foreign Service employees
should have the right to work without any mandatory retirement
age at all.

I'm not suggesting that that issue isn't there *

I'm only say that we did not litigate that issue in this case„
And it5s only fair to bring to your attention that we did not,
*

and that the Court did not focus on that issue# and that
there's no evidence in the record# or very little evidence
going to the point of whether or not a statute requiring
mandatory retirement at some age over 70 is or is not rational»
QUESTION:

What does the Secretary of State do when

a member of the Foreign Service Corps reaches age 70# if the
judgment is affirmed by this Court?

Does he retire him

pursuant to the Act of Congress, or does he just go back to
court and ask for instructions?
MRS. HOSTETLER;

Well, we have ten years until

someone reaches 70, and X would suppose that in that period
of time the State Department will decide what it wants to ask
Congress fee do in light of the fact that a provision of the
statute has been declared, unconstitutional•

This circumstance

often happens when a provision of a statute is held
uncons titutional.
QUESTION s

But usually there is some other statute

that will be held to be governing, and it's the comparison

25
between people governed by the other statute and the people
governed by the statute held unconstitutional and struck down #

Nell, theres s tv© vs ay 3 to look at

the classification in this case.
QUESTION s

I knoWo

MRS o HOSTETLERs

One is that the Foreign Service

statute itself makes the classification.

It puts in one

category Foreign Service employees who are under the age of
60 and able to ~~ and in another category Foreign Service
employees over the age of SO.

And in one instance it allows

the Foreign Service employees below the age of 63 to continue
to work, so long as they are able to perform? and in the other
it does not.
Another way to look at the classification is «•“

With some exceptions.

MRSe HOSTETLERs

That’s right, Ambassadors are

not subject to mandatory retirement.

But you've made no equal protection

attack upon that.
MRS. HOSTETLER;

No, I have not.

QUESTION:

Based upon that differentiation,,

MRSo HOSTETLERs
QUESTION s

We have not,

You are correct,

Did I correctly understand your observa~

tion about Mr Traffic Controllers for example, as one example
you gave, that it is within the power of Congress to fix a low
age for that category?
MRS, HOSTETLER*

Absolutely, So long as the

Legislature has a rational basis, so long as there is a rational
relationship between the classification and the mandatory
retirement age, at any age? and the objective of the State,
it’s certainly up to Congress to do that, and in fact there
may be many, many classifications and

many, many mandatory

retirement statutes that will still exist.
Certainly the Armed Forces will no doubt continue
to have lower mandatory retirement age,
QUESTION?

Mi’s, Hostetler, this prompts me to ask

you a rather basic question about the theory of your case,
As you point out, there are two separate classifications
created by this statute,:? one between persons working for the
Foreign Service who are over 60, and the other under 60? and,
secondly, a classification of Foreign Service versus Civil
Service,

Which of the two do you rely on as making this

statute unconstitutional?
Or do you rely on both?
MRS, HOSTETLER?

We rely on both.

28

QUESTION s

In other words, do you contend than that

if ail government employees had to retire at age 60 , the
statute would still be unconstitutional?
I didn’t so understand your brief, but I8d like to
know whether you so contendo
MBS® HOSTETLERs

No»

If all employees had to

retire at age 60, we would still contend that the statute was
unconstitutional»

We would make somewhat different arguments»

Let. me put it; another ways

If there were no Civil

Service csmplcyaes working overseas -QUESTIONS

Just say you have everything exactly

■the Saras,, but just everybody has to retire at age SO? would
you still say the statute is unconstitutional?
MRS» HOSTETLER*

Yea, because societal patterns, 'the

societal norm today is to allow people to work until age 70»
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act allows persons in
the private sector to work until age 70 and, indeed, makes
it wrong for employers to fire people before age 70»
QUESTIONS

Well, if you’re? right on that, we

don’t even have to lock at the comparison with ills Civil

MRS0 HOSTETLERS
QUESTIONs

I beg your pardon?

On this theory, we don’t

even have to

look at what happens to Civil Service»
MRSo HOSTETLER* That is correct, you do not have to

29

look at the Civil Service*,

The fact that Civil Service

employees worked until age 70 at the time this suit was
brought and now work ur.it.il they choose to retire, and the fact
that some Civil Service employees work overseas in the same
kind of jobs is simply cumulative evidence to the evidence in
the record that there is no rational basis for requiring
Foreign Service employees, because of ‘the nature of their job,
to retire as early as age 60, an age which is far below the
ag© accepted in society today as an age to quit working, an
age which is below what all the medical and scientific evidence
shows a person is able t© work*
QUESTIONs

Mrs* Hostetler, you used the phrase

“societal norms'5 and “accepted by society"? who sets those
norms?

What soft of norms ere you referring to?

-

Well, my question goes to who — what

entity «— what is the source of determining that something is

30

MRS» HOSTETLER3 Well, we have to look at the —
QUESTIONs

Now, if you5re talking about an Act of

Congress, that’s a better way to describe it„
MRS„ HOSTETLERs

No, we have to look at actual

facts and data in society, many of which is reflected in this
recordo For example, we? submitted uncontradicted evidence that
corporations, non-profit organisations, churches, missionary
groups work overseas, employ thousands of volunteers, hundreds
of thousands of volunteers and employees, and employ them
between the ages of 60 and 70,

The undisputed evidence is

that those employees are as able to work oversease, are as
competent as employees under the age of 60,
In short, there is nothing in the record to show
that employees working overseas between the ages of 60 and 70
are not competent to perform their work,
QUESTIONS

Mrs, Hostetler, supposing that Congress

were to say that became of the high rate of unemployment

years?
MRS« HOSTETLERS

That’s perfectly all right,

I do

apt
see any constitutional infirmity to that; in fact, the
‘tv.‘
government new has charged the years in several of its
agencies,, For example, in the Peace Corps — for different
reasons.

In the Peace Corps .an employee may not: work for

more than five years.,,

Well, that's the kind of system

that we have in the Foreign Service, it's not linked to age
so much, but year after year — every year employees in the
Foreign Service are evaluated and they are ranked in order of

On the second half of the discrimination, not over 60 versus
under 60, but Foreign Service versus Civil Service, you say

if these people perform essentially the same work but

were paid different salaries, would the lower~paid group have
a lawsuit to get the seme amount of compensation as the
others?
MRSo HOSTETLERs

Mot at all.

The government

QUESTION: Why not?
MRS. HOSTETLER:

The government may impose different

terms of employment to any number of categories , so long as
each tern is not constitutionally invalido
QUESTION2

Eut say there8s just no justification

in terms of difference of employment, say they are secretaries
with the same rate of speed, same skills, work the same
number of hours, the same working conditions and all the rest,
one group is paid $25 a week more than the others»

la there

a constitutional violation?
MRS. HOSTETLERs Well, there might be if the
conditions were precisely the same. And it’s hard for me to
imagine that working conditions in two different agencies
would be precisely the same, and that the talents arid require­
ments of the work force in each agency, in the respective
agencies would be precisely the same.
QUESTION:

Well, they could have different salary

scales, different promotion policies, different vacation
schedules? would those things violate a constitutional duty
of the United. States Government to treat all employees equally"

34
MRS„ HOSTETLER;
QUESTION;

No.

We*re not —

Well, if not, then why i3 there any

constitutional issue here at all?
MRS. HOSTETLER; We are not here claiming that
Foreign Service employees must b© treated exactly the same
as Civil Service employees,,

We are simply saying that Foreign

Service employees are being discriminated against because
their livelihood, their work is being taken away from them
at the age of 60, when there is no rational basis for that
work being taken away„

It assumes that older, that post-60»

year-olds are simply finable to perform any longer.
QUESTION;

Yes, but you must start, as I understand

your theory, you must start from the premise that the United
States Government has a duty to treat like employees equally»
Is there a duty of equal treatment to employees?
Mid if there is, why does it just apply to mandator
retirement and not salary, vacation, and everything else?
That, it seems to me, is something you have to be able to
answer.
MRS. HOSTETLER;

Well, if there were two employees

in the Foreign Service, a man and a woman 1st us say, performing
the sarris work, yes, it would ba unconstitutional for the
government to say, "We are going to pay the man more" or "We
are going to give him greater vacation benefits".
QUESTION:

Well, say they are both women.

Let's say

35
*

they ars both women*

Don't introduce another element of

difference*
MRS, HOSTETLIRs

All right®

Both women® And let’s

suppose the government, the agency was being arbitrary and
choosing to favor one woman over the other®

But in most

instances, Mr® Justice Stevens, I must say the government
will offer some rational explanation for the distinction in
treatment*

It will say this person has a degree and the

other docs not*

This person works late and the other does

not®
QUESTION :

But Justice Stevens’ question, I take

it, is based on the proposition that the government can’t
offer any explanation®

What if the government can’t?

MRS* HQSTETLERs
QUESTION s

If the government could offer

Does it then give rise to a constitution i.'!

question?
MRS* HOSTETLER:

I guess I misunderstood the

question*
QUESTION s

If the two woman or two men doing the

same work are not paid the same, what provision of the
Constitution requires the Court to order them, to pay them the

same?
MRS® HOSTETLER: Well, that would be equal protection
also*

That would be the same claim, certainly*
The central point in this case is that; although the

36
court below requested the government on several occasions to
submit facts to show that there ivas a rational basis for the
age 60 retirement, the government was simply not able to do

HRS „< HOSTETLER:
QUESTION:

But that one —

That’s the one I’m talking about,

MRS. HOSTETLER:

All right* but that was enacted

years before the 1946 Act* and it’s gust not relevant#
Moreover, the colloquy omits the context in which
it occurred#

If you will look at our brief* I believe on

page 29 to 30 of our brief* you will see 'the full colloquy

set forth* and you will see that in 192 4 there was no
retirement system whatsoever for consular and diplomatic
officers#

.And the purport of the Rogers Act was to give* to

get in place a retirement system#

It was to give an. oppor-

37
fcunity for Foreign Service officers to retire and to receive
a pension»
There was no consideration of whether or not
Foreign Service employees had to retire at age 65, because
they were no longer able to parform their work overseas»
In 1946, when this provision came into effect, the
legislative history is silent? there is no discussion of the
age 60 provision®

In fact, it is curious that, as world

health standards have improved and life expectancy has
increased over the years, the retirement age in the Foreign
Service has gotten lower and lower»
no retirement age,,

Before 1924 there was

In 1924, when life expectancy was 58,

the retirement age was 65; and now, from 1945 to the present
time', the age; ia lowered to 60, when tbs life expectancy is
now 73 or 74» And we all know that world conditions have
improved since 1924 and 1946» We new, for exeimple, have jet
transportation and modern medical facilities at

virtually

every Foreign Service -pose»
Moreover, the Solicitor General noted that Foreign
Service employees are subject to terrorist attacks»

However,

there is no evidence that terrorist attack is age related.
Foreign Service employees, moreover, are not armed, are not
expected to resist or counter terrorist attack or other
violence.
And, in fact, we send our Ambassadors, who are not

38
subject to mandatory retirement age, to some of the most
violence-prons posts in. the world,,

As we all know, Ellsworth

Bunker served in Vietnam at the height of the Vietnam War
at the age of 80„
QUESTIONs Well, of course, Oliver Wendell Holmes
stayed hare until his nineties, but that doesn't prove we
can all do it, does it?

MRS, HOSTETLER:

Probably not,,

How, let’s look at the facts underlying the
government’s argument that mandatory retirement is a necessary
management tool which the government needs to make room for
younger officers, thereby insuring competence at the
Ambassadorial or other high levels of the officer corps.
At the outsat, let's keep in mind that 3,000 of these employee!.!,
or one-third of the 10,000 work force, are not even officers.#
they are librarians, schoolteachers and the like».

The

mandatory retirement of these employees hardly insures
competence at the Ambassadorial level or other high levels of
tb.e officer corps„
Secondly, we are talking about a de minimis number of
employees whe are likely even to want to continue to work
past the age of 609
QUESTION: Do you think that Congress is entitled to
take into account the importance of attracting bright, able,
young people in, and to take into account the further fact

39
that unless they move people up and out at the senior levels,
they aren't going to be able to offer as attractive a career?
MRSe KQSTETLIRs Well, that's the point I was just
beginning to make, Mr» Justice Burger®

We’re talking about

the fact that only 50 employees, 44 officers are still on
the employment rolls at: the age of 59»

The overwhelmingly

most common age for retirement among social retirees today
is age 62»

Only five-tJhousandths of one percent of federal

Civil Service employees even stay on the Civil Service rolls
until age 70e
There is such a de minimis number of officers at
age SO who are likely to want to continue to work past 60
that it simply is not credible that they are going to clog
up the upper levels of the Foreign Service or that they are
going to in fact have an appreciable «affect on morale or
recruitment»
Moreover, keep in mind that in the Foreign Service,
unlike the Civil Service, an employee is not hired to perform
a particular job» h Foreign Service employee must accept
assignment to any post in 'the world, and must perform any
job given him, whether or not it is of a nature ordinarily
performed by someone at that rank»

In fact, it is quite

common in the Foreign Service for employees to perform work
that is not commensurate with their grade level»
The Foreign Service also has broad administrative

40
authority to assign its employees to other government agencies ,
State and local governments, tbr

nonprofit organisations and

to universities»
Thus, the Foreign Service has a variety of mechanisms
to insure that there is turnover, both at the top level jobs
and in every other job, to provide employees with new job
assignments and new challenges, and to bring to any positions
in the Foreign Service employees who have not previously
served in them and who may have new ideas»
And let’s look at the kind of employee that is likely
to be in this group of 50 employees still on the employment
rolls at the Foreign Service at the age of 60» Every year
11,000 applicants apply for the Foreign Service; only 100 to
200 are taken in»
every year»

However they entered they are rank-ordered

The bottom portions of the classes are selected

out» Those who are not promoted are selected out:. Those who
fail biannual medical examinations are selected out»

There

are voluntary retirements at age 50, beginning at age 50,
•1

with age 55 being the most common age of • voluntary retirement;
people resign, shortly after they enter the Foreign Service,
when they find that Foreign Service life is not to their
liking» And thus, of the 44 officers who remain in the Service
at ago 59, they are presumably, by the Department's own
criteria, the cream of the crop»
QUESTIONs Don’t you think that the mandatory retire-

41
meat provision may have seme domino effect on the willingness
or choice of voluntary retirement at age 55?

That is, if

people didn't know that, they were going to have to retire at
60, they might not voluntarily retire at age 55?
MRSo HOSTETLERs Well, it no doubt does have some
effect on that. But if you will read the House Select
Committee on Aging Report issued this year, in connection with
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act amendments, you will
see that there are many factors that workers take today into
account in deciding on an early ratir€imosnt, and the fact that
they are going to have to retire anyway at some point is but
one of a large number of factors and certainly cannot be said
to be the decisive factors
QUESTIONS

1 hope you're not forgetting Mr» Justice

Marshall6s question about Murgia.

Or do you feel you've dealt

with that enough?
MRS« HOSTETLERs

No»

We agree with the government

that Murgia is the case most nearly on point, that it is in
accord with Reed and Trimbel and Craig vs» Boren, and this
Court's other decisions in recent years in the equal protectior
area? that it simply sayo to the courts below that they must
look at the facts in the record to see if there is in *£act a
rational basis? whether there is a fair,not arbitrary, and
substantial, not tenuous, relationship between the classifica­
tion and the objective of the State.

42
You applied this reasoning in Murgla and you found
that there was a rational basis.
