Mr. Cardin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD L„ CARDIN, ESQ.,
CM BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CARDIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Modern technology, today's society and improved
standard of living and new conveniences also presents a seri­
ous challenge to the personal rights of an individual.

This

was anticipated many years ago by this Court's dissent when
in Olmsfcead it was stated that a form of reaching a means
of invading privacy had become available to the government -QUESTION:

Actually, your client would be a lot

better off if we still had the system where the operator
answered when you pick up the phone and said "number please,"
wouldn't he?
MS. CARDIN:

If we had that system, then I believe

that the state's comparison to voluntarily giving over in­
formation might well be founded.

I don't believe it is

founded under the cir cum stances here, which I do -QUESTION;

So modern technology is actually improv­

ing the position of your client.
MR. CARDIN:

No, sir, I don't believe so.

Modern

technology lias now permitted this*
better service.

In so doing, it has also permitted the police

department to use a sophisticated means of invading privacy,
if you will,
•QUESTIONS

Well, isn't one of your arguments that

under the modern technology whereby local calls simply are not
monitored by the telephone company, that there is an expecta­
tion of privacy because nobody except the caller knows and
under the old technology, whereby the telephone company
operator answered for your number, you knew that you were
telling a third party what the number was.
MR, CARDIN;

Yes, sir.

that, that is correct.
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, I do agree with

As to the —

Mr. Cardin, in agreeing with Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, are you saying in effect that you would agree that
there would have been no search in the olden days, let's call
it, as my kids like to refer to it, when if a police officer
had sat next, to the operator and just wrote down all the
numbers from one particular — said every time number so-andso calls, I would like to know who they are calling, and he
jusit say there and wrote down the numbers they were calling,
there would be no search there?
I

MR. CARDIN;
search.

I am not agreeing there would be no

What I am saying is there may not have been an ex­

pectation of privacy at that point because one is voluntarily

5
turning over —
QUESTION:

Then if there is no expectation of pri­

vacy, at least there is no Fourth Amendment question.
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION:
MR. CARDINs

Yes, sir, that is correct.
Okay.
I think there is concern, I just don't

think there is the expectation.
QUESTION:

You don't know — at least I don't know,

maybe it is well known •— back in the olden days whether the
operator knew what the originator of the number was.
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, I don’t know, Your Honor.
And the answer to his question would de­

pend upon whether or not she did.
MR. CARDIN:

It sounds like we are vindicating the

fathers of science and purging the government means of
espionage.

I think we have seen many more advances in our

day.
The case of Michael Smith presents an example of
modern technology, if you will.

Using the telephone in the

privacy of his residence, he took an action to exclude what
is known now as the curious ear.

He certainly did not expect

that the telephone company would seize the numbers that he
dialed, and so we come to the first important factor that has
to be considered with the use of pen register devices and
similar types of devices.

6
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that this coultin ' t be

done without a warrant?
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION;

I am suggesting -—
It couldn't ba done under’ any circum­

stances?
MR. CARDIN;
be done.

I believe with a warrant it can properly

I agree with Title III, as cited in our brief* and

I think it ~~ we believe it does require a warrant.
The .important factor in these type of cases is that
the action of recording these numbers was initiated by the
police department* not by the telephone company as part of
its housekeeping functions.

Several months ago, this Court

in the New York Telephone Company case alluded to the fact,
that the telephone company admits that it uses pen registers
to check those ~~ to detect fraud and prevent violations of
the law.

In each of these instances, they were houskeeping-

type functions.

I would ask you to compare the situation —

QUESTION;

Well, doesn’t the average subscriber

know that?
MR. CARDIN:

But if these are instances that he is

aware of, he makes a long-distance phone call —
QUESTION;
MR. CARDIN;

He knows it is not private.
He .knows it is not private and he mak-'

a long-distance phone call.
QUESTION;

No, he knows it is not private locally.

that at times the phone company will cut in.
MR. CZiRDIN:

In those instances where he has made a

complaint about it and there are certain issues, that is
correct.

few in number.

-There are occasions —
Very,, very few in number.

There are other occasions.

There are

They are very

The typical piece of apparatus used by the

telephone company is not tha pen. register, it is a tracing
device which is placed on someone else’s phone or the sub­
scriber's phone and used to find out where a call is caning
from.

The pen register is used only in a very limited number

of cases by the telephone company.
QUESTION;

Mr. Cardin, do you think the police need

a warrant to use a tracing device?
MR. CARDIN;
QUESTION;

No, sir.

If I as a person —

But you are going to find out where the

call came from and... invade that person's privacy, aren't you?
MR. CARDIN;

I disagree because in the function of

the tracing device, the device is placed on the subscriber's
phone who has made the ccsnplaint.

Thereafter- the tracing

goes through the telephone company itself and does not actually
bridge the other end of the line.

It stops right before it

gest to the other end of the line,
QUESTION;

But it obtains information about the other

(sad of the line, without the knowledge of the person at the
other end of the line.
MR. CARDIN:

I think it is a matter of semantics.

It does not find out information at the other end of the line.
That is what wa are talking about —
QUESTION;

Say, A calls B, you put the device on

B's phone, you find cut that A made the call and A didn't
expect you to find that out.

Why isn't, that precisely the

same invasion of A‘s privacy if you had put it on A's phone?
MR. CARDIN;

The tracing device does not. in actuality

find that A made the call.

That is the reason why in this

particular set of facts, if tlva tracer was used, a pen
register was put at the residence of Michael Smith —
QUESTION:

But not until after they found out that

the call originated from Michael Smith's phone, which they
found out by putting a tracing device on B’s phone and find­
ing out that a call had originated, frcsa A6s phone.

Isn't

that right?
MR. CARDIN;

In the instant case, the-tracing device

was not put at Smith’s hems, that is the point that I make.
It went to a pay phone and from there other —
QUESTION;

Well, from my question, i.f it had gone

directly to A's home, and you thereafter put a — why isn’t
the tracing device just as much an invasion of A's privacy as
the pen register?

9

MR. CARDIN:
that it is.

There are many parsons who would argue

I say it isn't, but there are many eases —-

QUESTION:

In terras of expectation of privacy, is

there a difference?
MR. CARDIN:

Yes, I believe so.

I believe so, be­

cause in this instance the listening ear is not caning from
that particular person’s phone apparatus, it is coming from
some place else and is similar, as I will get to, in the
situation of the mail covers and the making of the deposit.
QUESTION:

Is this in the record, about all of

these different ways?
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry?
Is there anything in the record about

tracing and all of these different things?
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION;
MR. CARDIN:

Tracing methods?
Yes.
No, there is nothing in the record

about that.
QUESTION:

Because you are wrong in your facts about

how they do it.
MR. CARDIN:

I'm sorry, I am wrong in my facts about

a tracer?
QUESTION:

You trace right up to the phone and then

you get back the exact number of the phone that was called,
where it is located, who they traced it to, et cetera, et

10
cetera,.
MR. CARDINi

I would only submit to Your Honor that

the information I have did crane from the investigation depart­
ment of the telephone company in Baltimore.
The point we males is that this was an action that
was precipitated by the police department and not by the tele­
phone company.

We compare the situation of a housekeeper

coming into a hotel roan, in one instance she is coming in
and performing her duties and comes across something, that
is one situation; on the other hand, if she is contacted by
the police department and they say why don't you go into that
room for us and see what is there because wa suspect something
may be going on, then she is operating as the agent of the
police department and is not properly on the premises at that
time.

We believe that analogy is much closer than the

analogies that have been submitted or suggested by the state.
The comparison, if you will, to mail covers and
deposits are not similar to the pen register situation.

It

is suggested that with the voluntary turning over of informa­
tion to third persons when one turns over a letter to a clerk,
or when one makes a deposit in a bank, that may be true, but
there is not a voluntary turning over of information when one
dials ills phone.
As you wall know, going back to the long-distance
call, the person making a long-distance call, who dials or

11
presses "one/ that activates •»QUESTIONt
doesn't it?

That depends on what state you are in*

In the State of Virginia, for example* you don't,

you have to dial the area code but you don’t dial ’'one,”
MR. CARDIN:

The point is that you dial — let me

change it, you dial, something to activate the pen register
type of device, so that when dialing a local call assumes
that there is no pen register device working, whereas if one
dials a long-distance call knows that he is putting in opera­
tion — it may not be a pen register, he may not know the
term, but seme kind of device is going to record the number
that he is dealing so that he will be charged for it, and
number two, he can check the accuracy of the phone company’s
bill.
There is a substantial difference betweem that local
call and that long-distance call.

When one then dials the

'’one" or the area code, he is then voluntarily turning over
the information similar to the deposit or to the mailing of
an envelope or the mailing of a letter* or when a person is
in the room and is talking supposedly confidentially to a
third person.

But before he activates that kind of device,

he is not voluntarily turning over.information.
I would like again to turn to Mr. Justice Relinquishs s
question about the operator.

If the person were to call the

operator for assistance in making that call, then ha is

12
obviously voluntarily turning over that information to the
operator and takes the chance that that information may later
be conveyed to someone else.

But until he does that, it can­

not be said in any realistic way that he has voluntarily
turned over that information.

Thus it might be perceived that

in the situation of the mail cover or a deposit that the in­
formation could he revealed to law enforcement officers.
It might be foreseeable that one dials a long­
distance call by activating the pen register device and takes
the chance that that information will be turned over, but not
until he activates that device is there any reasonable expec­
tation that that information will be turned over to anyone.
The question as to why —
QUESTIONS

Unless the callae happens to be a police

informant.
MR. CARDIN:

Even at that stage, he wouldn’t know

where the number came from.
QUESTION:

I know, but the person who answars the

phone knows that the other person called him.
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION:
MR, CARDINs

That, he dialed the number.
I certainly know that you called me.
Only the fact that I called, but you

don’t know the number that it emanated from.
QUESTION:
MR. CARDIN:

No.
Unless you know me or assume where I

13
c ame from.
QUESTION:

Well, if you say who you are,- I know you

called me.
MR. CARDIN:

I agree with that.

I am saying unless

there is that type of situation, there is no reason to believe
that anyone is recording the number that you dialed or I
dialed in a local situation.
Now, the third pertinent part of the factual situa­
tion is why should I stand here and ask this Court to require
a search warrant or a similar type of court order prior to the
installation of such a device.
We start out with the premise that search warrants
and court orders are preferred to any situation where there
is a search and seizure.
QUESTION:

As we review —

it is not in the case of an arrest, is

there?
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION;
MR. CARDIN;

We are talking here about —
I thought you said search or seizure.
I'm sorry, a search and seizure not

following a valid arrest.
Every case that was submitted to this Court for its
consideration — I take that back — every federal case that
was submitted to this Court for its consideration had in fact
a court order involved in it.

And I believe I can state

fairly to this Court that it is the practice in the federal

14
system to require a court order or a search and seizure
warrant before a pen register is attached.

There is in fact

a statement by Professor Carr in his book on electronic sur­
veillance that this is the practice in the federal system and
that there is certainly a great many of the states that have
followed the precedent of the federal system.
The reason, of course, is that with a warrant wa are
doing first a general search, there is particularity as to
what is seized.

There is a -

QUESTION:

Mr. Cardin, how can there be particular­

ity, he put the device on and it is on 24 hours a day, isn't
it?
MR. CARDIN £
tion.

Well, we talk about the average situa­

There are the abnormal situations also.

In other words,

if we have an address and this address happens to be a highrise apartment building and then you may have a pern register
device placed on hundreds of phones, hundreds of numbers so
that I believe there would be a requirement —
QUESTION;

Do you think a judge would grant probable

cause based on hundreds of numbers, find probable casue or
probably engaged in violation of the law and therefore they are
all subject to penalty?
MR. CARDIN;

Oh, no, I think it would require the

officer at that point or the law enforcement to proceed with
an investigation to learn the particular phone which he

15
believes or has probable cause to believe is the phone number
involved.
QUESTION :

You are particular in means of limiting

it to one phone, not to what can he done with that phone.
MR. CARDIN:

I agree that every number would be

recorded, particularity as to where we are going, not what
is being —
QUESTION:

You are not talking about hundreds of

phones, are you?
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION:

I am talking about one phone.
Well, you ware talking about a tall build­

ing with hundreds of phones.
MR.. CARDIN:

The warrant would provide a duration

as to how long the pen register device would be permitted or
the phone.

A return requirement or a warrant causes the

officers to use some of that discretion as to how they will
later use that information that is obtained, that innocent
information, if you will* the requirement that there 'he a
crirae that either has been committed or is about to be com­
mitted.

I think that is very important.

In other words,

without seme kind of a warrant requirement, that device can
be placed on a phone for any reason, for intelligence informa­
tion, whereas, as stated in Burger v. New York, there should
be a reason to believe a crime is about to be committed o.r
has beer?, committed.

There is no such requirement under

16
circumstances as they presently exist.
QUESTION;

Hr. Cardin? did the Court of Appeals hold

that this was a search and seizure but didn't require a warrant
or that it was not a search and seizure?
MR. CARDIN;

I believe they held that it was not a

search and seizure.
QUESTION:

So if you are comparing the necessity of

a warrant to doing it simply on probable cause without a war™
rant? I take it that has no applicability here?
MR. CARDIN;

Without a warrant or court order? there

is no placing or taking of responsibility.

Not so long ago,

out of the State of Maryland, this Court dealt with the
Giordano case and noted that it was important that application
be made by certain persons who were designated so that there
could be responsibility, there could be supervision as to the
actions taken»
QUESTION;
MR. CARDIN;
the statute

Well, they were designated by statute.
I understand that, and I believe that

contained that specific point, as this Court

stated, in order to assure that they would be responsible for
the application —QUESTION:

The state of Maryland provided by similar

statute that warrants could only issue under terms of that
statute.

It hasn't done so here, I take it?

MR. CARDIN:

There is no statutory authority for —

17
QUESTIONS

So what has Giordano got to do with the

statutory requirements with this case?
MR. CARDIN;

The fact is that the Court held that

that particular provision of the wiretap statute had to be
complied with strictly with indications that this was a very
important part of that statute and one which could not be
accoraplishec by substantive compliance.

What we are saying

here is to callow an officer, when he is armed -- we don’t
even know who the officer might be, whether he has investiga­
tive background or if he is high or low within the police
department, just to allow anyone to go in and police the pen
register would ba wrong, that there should be some increment
of responsibility and the only way we can do it is to require
that there ke a court order.
there is supervision.

As such, there is accountability,

Without it, there .is complete

decentralization and decentralization leads to abuse.
Tie failure to require that a warrant oz* court, order
be obtained prior to the installation of the pen z’egister can
also have a far-reaching effect on destroying one's personal
rights.

As indicated in the brief, as

describe it as a

chilling effect., on freedom of speech and association.

One

cannot necessarily speak for another as to why or why not he
does things.

But the fact that it would be common knowledge

or mil be common knowledge to any investigating officer to
whan, he spoke to, who he knows may well place a chilling

13
effect one freedom of speech and as an adjunct to that , frocdav
of association.
There is a strong possibility of abuse by law en­
forcement officers of this type of device.

The fact that the

possibility of illegal wiretaps as a simple adjunct to this
device has teen discussed and is discussed in the brief.
The use of the information by an irresponsible
officer can cause the innocent to suffer, it can- cause intimi­
dation to persons,

it can be used for many, many purposes not

consistent with the investigation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cardin, what was entered in evidence

against your client as a result of the attachment of the pen
register?
MR. CARDIN:

A photograph.

QUESTION:

A what?

MR. CARDIN:
back a little bit.

A photographs

I'm sorry, let me go

After the pen register was affixed and a

call to the robbery victim's home was found to be the same time
as to the number of the robbery victim's heme was punched out
on the pen register, the police department or police officer
went to the Baltimore Police Department files, obtained a
photograph of Smith, took that photograph along with others
to the victim who identified that photograph.
QUESTION:
evidence?

And then was the photograph admitted in

19
MR. CARDIN:

Yes, it was.

And there was a stipula­

tion that without the first step, that is the attachment of
the pen register and obtaining the information of Michael Lae
Smith that way, the photograph would never have been obtained
and as such ~
QUESTION s

He would never have been arrested without

that pen register?
MR. CARDIN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
But even assuming a gross violation in

his arrest, can he — even assuming that you are right and
that his arrest was the result of a gross violation or a
conceded violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, does it follow
that his conviction gets set aside?

I think in cases like

Frisbe v. Collins where the defendant was kidnapped and
abducted from one state to another to stand trial, and this
Court held non constat, that has nothing to do with it, he
got a fair trial and we didn’t disturb his conviction, even
___

conceding that this was a gross violation of his Fourteenth
Amendment rights.
MR. CARDIN;

Justice Stewart, at the trial of the

case, it was stipulated, as I say, that he, that is the
accused, Michael Lee Smith, would never have been identified
unless this device was used, that is that the use of this
particular device was to identify my client»
QUESTION;

It resulted in his arrest.

20
MR, CARDIN:

It resulted in his being identified,

otherwise he would never have been identified, there never
had been a warrant for his arrest without that.

And I think

he would not have been charged with this particular common
law robbery.
Failure to require the court order or warrant may
lead to instrument use of the pen register.

As I indicated,

anyone, any law enforcement officer could obtain this device.
The state in its brief, on page 14, suggests that a pen
register should be allowed in cases where suppression *— I'm
sorry, where, suspicion exists.

What suspicion?

Whose

suspicion?
A search and seizure based on suspicion is contrary
to our Constitution.

It is this, that theory which we seek to

avoid.
I would ask to reserve the few moments that I have
left for rebuttal.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall.

Mr. Attorney General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN H. SACHS, ESQ.,
ON 3EHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SACHS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like to begin if I may by indicating to the
Court, what the pen register is not.

I think, Mr. Justice

21
Marshall, we know something about that from this Court's
definition in Gioradno and in Mew York Telephone, we know
something about it from the Court8s fairly lengthy discussion
in the Minth Circuit in the Hobbs case, we know sib out it from
various Law Review articles that have appeared and cited in
the briefs.

We know even in this sparse record that the

telephone company representative who testified at a hearing
in these proceedings referred to the pen register as a normal
-- as normal telephone equipment is what he called it.
But the point I would like to make. Your Honors, is
that there is no sound, it captures no words uttered into the
mouth piece, as this Court raised in Katz, it captures no
content, it. receives no canmunication other than the data
communication between the phone company and the user.

It has

been defined by Congress, indeed by its exclusion from the
requirements of Title III as not to be a communication.

It

doesn't disclose that the call is completed, it doesn't review
who the caller is, it doesn't say the number was busy, it
/

doesn't say who the parties are and it doesn't tell the dura­
tion of the call.
QCESTIONs

Are you suggesting there is no right of

privacy or no expectation of privacy as to what calls are
being made, that is to whom they are being made, from your
hone or your office?
MR,* SACHS:

That is precisely what we are contending,

22

Your Honor.

There is no reasonable expectation of privacy,

and I would go so far as to say that in a great many cases,
i although it is unprovable, but inherently there is frequently
not a subjective expectation of privacy.
The user of the telephone knows, to go back to the
days, however long ago they may be, to go back to the days
when this was not done mechanically but done by human com­
munication, one says to the operator, "Millie, get me George"
or "Get me Sam down at the grocery store."

All that is done

now, Your Honor, is that we communicate a part, of that in­
formation, the number we wish to achieve to a phone company
who is not statutorily barred from disclosing that information to third parties.

Unlike communication between the party

calling and the party —
QUESTION:

Are you saying that the phone company

wouldn't be subject to a suit if they were to disclose it to
a third party?
MR. SACHS:

In the Hobbs case in the Ninth Circuit,

Your Honor, I think it was held not to be subject to suit.
The phone company is at liberty to give that information to
a third party, at least a local authority which is all I mean
to contend —
QUESTION:
MR. SACHS:

Oh.
All I need to contend in this case, Your

Honor, is that local authority without a warrant but police

company and the phone company would be

it has been so held —

The phone company -— the police officer

can also get unlisted phones, too.
MR. SACHS;

That raises perhaps a different question,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

I don't see where that makes it legal if

the police officer can get those.
ME. SACHS:

The question I am addressing myself to,

Mr. Justice Marshall, is whether —
QUESTION;

I don't see how you need all of this

argument.
MR. SACHS;

I was trying to respond to the Chief

Justice —
QUESTION;
MR. SACHS;

I sm sorry, I apologize.
My point, sir, is that the user of the

telephone has no reasonable expectation that the information
he imparts to the company, the number he x-rlshes to achieve,
will not be imparted to another

person.

He knows that every

month he gets the long-distance calls he dials, he knows that,
in many parts of the country telephones are subject to
separate constructions, so that for billing purposes

the

phone company needs to know how many calls for certain pur™
poses are used.

He knows that the telephone company is in

the business of protecting its own tariffs and its own

24
customers by investigating complaints of annoying and obscene
telephone calls.

He knows all of those things.

He is told in his phone book, may it please the
Court, in every phone book in this Nation he knows, and 1
have -- I don't think I stray very far from the record in
this case in reading to you what the phone book says, and
what it says at least in Washington, D» C„, is that we have
employees who are 'trained, to assist and advise you, that can
frequently help in identifying to the authorities the origin
of unwelcome and trouble sane calls.
So for all of those reasons, we suggest to the Court
that the average telephone user probably ought not to have
a subjective expectation of privacy as to the number called.
But in any case, it is not an expectation that ought to be
recognised for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.

bookie once or twice a day to place bats that it would be an
entirely private matter in a private place?
MR. SACHS:

Your Honor, in almost every phase in

which evidence that has bean obtained surreptitiously, whether

25
within, the warrant requirement or without the warrant require­
ment, there has been a subjected expectation by the defendant
who arrives in the case having had his confidence betrayed.
So in that sense, to answer your question, yes, everyone who
gets caught took a risk and lost.
QUESTION;

That is true of the distinguished

physician who commits statutory rape, too, I suppose, wouldn't
it, with the implicit assumption that his victim would not
inform on him?
MR. SACHS;

It was true of Mr. Hoffa, it was true

of Mr. osbacn, it was true of Mr. Lewis, it was true of Mr-.
Lopez, it was true of Von Lusch, it was true of White, it
was txue of the misplaced confidence cases.

It was true of

the user of the Bank in Newark, it is true of someone who
corresponds through the mails and doesn't expect mail covers
to be used.

It is true of people who have marihuana in their

suitcase but dogs smell it and he is apprehended that way.

It

is true with people ~QUESTION:
unlawful things.

Mr. Sachs, you are speaking of a lot of-

There is nothing unlawful about calling a

bookie, at least in Maryland I guess there isn't.
MR. SACHS;

Wall, I think the answer to that question

it is, at least the last time I looked at the law.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume a state

I thought

Maryland, that gambling was legal in Maryland because you have

26
horse racing and usually horse racing survives by gambling.
But suppose you have got a state
MR. SACHS;

There is a difference, if I may say so,

Mr, Chief Justice, perhaps between the bookie who is not
regulated by the state and thus unlawful and the lottery
location which is regulated by the state and is lawful.

Aside

from that, there may not be.
QUESTION;

The governor of the state, let8s say, of

Utah, he is placing a telephone call to a bookie and he cer­
tainly hopes that is not going to be made known within the
population, the Mormon population of the State of Utah, doesn’t
he?
MR. SACHS;

I am sure that is true, Your Honor, but

QUESTIONS

There is no reasonable or legitimate ex­

one —

pectation of privacy, this is a risky thing.
MR, SACHS;

I am saying, Your Honor, that it is a

risk that he takes and it is the kind of risk that this Court
has sanctioned in a great many cases.

This Court sanctioned

the risk in all tha cases that I already mentioned, that when
you confide in a friend, a -trusted confident, you run the
risk that that person will either later go to the authorities
or has bean an undercover agant all the time.
Among the balances

I shouldn't say balances, but

among the lists of tests to test the one legal question we are

21

asking in this as.se, namely is there a reasonable expectat 1 :s\
of privacy In the ceKimtmication of the numbers dialed,

Among

them is, as this Court has recognised, the assumption of the
risk — among them is the extent of the intrusion, among
them is whether thought, words, communication in the normal
sense is captured, and it is the state’s position in this case,
Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, that both factually
and legally this case falls well on the safe side of the
Fourth Amendment.
I must say to the Court that there is a sense in
which this case both doctrine and factually has already been
decided by this Court.

It is a kind of a backwater factually

and legally.
If I may enter what Mr. Justice Rehnquist said a
few moments ago, it is really alive that what we are testing
here is something as to which over the years there has beerincreased factual privacy and the average phone user probably
does have in fact more privacy than he or she did fifty years
ago when the phone was first used.

And the specre of electron­

ic surveillance that was injected into the case by the
petitioner seems to me displaced because what we have here is
really a phone company mechanism that is very much a par .
their normal and routine operations which people understand
and know are likely to be at any given moment for lots of
different reasons breached by the phone company or the phone

28

company which may than go to lawful authorities.
It is the state's position, Mr. Chief Justice and
members of the Court, that the communication made here to the
phone company, the numbers dialed is a business communication
to a company which has every reason in the world to record
and on occasion reveal that information, and there is no kind
of communicat ion nor the kind of circumstances that this Court
in any of its prior rulings has said it is against.
QUESTIONs

General Sachs, what do you do with your

claimant's example of a maid in a hotel room?

You certainly

have an anticipation that a third party would be in the room
but you don't expect the police to come in.
MR. S&CHSs

That is true, Your Honor.

The Stoner

case, I think this Court distinguishes the hotel situation
and I think the answer to that is that in a hotel situation
the hiring of the hotel room does not expect that the full
search from police officers without a warrant will take place.
It is very different, we suggest, that a communication out
from that hotel room or from one's home on these lines of a
company which is not your own, on equipment which is not your
own, of a communication much like calling the plumber and
saying I hava water in ray cellar, please come, that plumber
can if he wishes tell the police “Sachs has water in his
cellar. "

The call ccuiing out from the hotel roan to the

butcher that says I want three pork chops, could be revealed

29
to the police, "Sachs wants three pork chops,"
In the same sense, when I say I want 466-6187 to
the phone company, I run the risk and we say a legitimate
risk that that information may be eonraunicated to the police,
QUESTION;

And they can convict me and put me in

jail?
MR, SACKS:
QUESTION;
MR. SACHS;

Yes.
That is a lot different from a pork chop.
To answer that, yes, Your Honor, you

are right.
QUESTION;

Going back, Mr. Attorney

General, to the

hotel room, I would assume everyone takes the risk if he
leaves a .4E automatic on top of the dresser in the hotel
roatt or a package of marihuana, that the hotel maid is under
.instructions and is very likely to report that to the house­
keeper or the manager who will report it to the police.
MR. SACHS;
that.

Yes, Your Honor, I certainly agree with

There are some cases, to return to Mr. Justice Stevens’

inquiry, there are some cases whiah do recognise a limited
kind of privilege here, the taxicab case which I think
recognises that for seme time and for some purposes you may
relinquish your privacy for sane purposes but not for all.
And I certainly conced, I must, that the hotel room may well
fall into that category, but it is an intrusion by the police
into the room.

It has the general aspects of a generalised

30

search of everything in that room, and I think, as we know
frcrn Rakus and as we know .from other recent cases of this
Court, we have not abandoned property concepts altogether
when we analyze the Katz expectation test.

So I think that

is the distinction, Mr. Justice, that I would draw between
that and this.
In sum, Mr. Chief Justice and. members of the Court,
I simply want to say that as three circuits have recognised,
the Ninth, the Fifth and the First, as the Congress of the
United States recognized by not including in Title III the
pen register, and as this Court has come very close already
by recognizing in New York Telephone that the pen register is
a far lesser intrusion than the wiretap.
For those reasons and the sound application of the
Fourth Amendment, we respectfully urge the Court to affirm
the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals.
Thankyau very much, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Very well, Mr. Attorney

General.
Do you have anything further, Mr. Cardin?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD L. CARDIN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ~ REBUTTAL
MR. CARDINs

I would only point out, going back to

our example of the hotel roan, that in the instance where
the housekeeper turns over information and we accept that as

31
being proper, we don't have that situation here where the pen
register is attached not by the telephone company for its
housekeeping purposes but by the police department for its
investigative purposes.
QUESTION:
property.

But it is attached to telephone company

It isn't, attached to the defendant's property,
MR. CARDIN:

It is attached to the telephone com­

pany's lines, that is correct, Your Honor.
by the company.

The lines are owned

I believe that is suggested, that the portion

of linas are. in effect leased to the subscriber, that is his
use of them is .in a sense a lease or a renting of —
QUESTION:

In Katz the surveillance was on telephone

c crap any proper y.
MR. CARDIN:
QUESTION:
MR. CARDIN:

Yes.
A pay phone booth.
I would close by stating briefly from

Burger, ths is no formality that we require today but a
fundamental role that, has long been recognized as basia to
the privacy of every hone in America.

While requirements of

the Fourth Amendment are not inflexible or obtusely unyield­
ing to legitimate needs of law enforcement, it. is not asking
]

too much of officers being required to the basic commands of
the Fourth Amendment before the privacy of one's home or
office are invaded.
QUESTION:

What would you say if the telephone

32
company sent a letter to all of its subscribers that from here
on we are publishing the lists that are available in our
office on demand,, on request, a list of all the calls from any
telephone in the city.
QUESTION:

Under the Freedom of Information Act.

QUESTION:

Just anybody who wants them can have

them.
MR. CARDIN;

If the telephone — let me respond by

saying this, I think the telephone company has in fact done
that as far as long-distance calls are concerned.

I think we

all recognize that.
QUESTION:

So you have no complaints about that then?

MR. CARDIN;

There is no expectation of the privacy.

But now the way they have done, I believe that one expects
when he dials that local number —
QUESTION;

You are really relying on someone else

for confidentiality.
MR. CARDIN;

I am suggesting that there is nobody

listening to that local line, listening to that number being
dialed unless —■
QUESTION:

You are relying on the telephone company

not itself to keep track of the calls that you are making and
f

publishing them?
MR. CARDIN:

It certainly doesn:t do it in Maryland,

at least to ay knowledge.

QUESTIONS

So the answer is yes?

MR. CARDIN;
QUESTION;

Yes.
Under Mr. Justice White's question, when

the telephone company announces, you

wguM

be in the same

situation on local calls as you would be on long-distance
calls, wouldn't you?
MR. CARDIN;
QUESTION;

I would agree with that.
And there is no intrusion.

MR. CARDIN;
QUESTION;

No intrusion, physical intrusion?
Of any kind, because what canes out of

that is what goes into it.
MR. CARDIN;

There is no intrusion as such like if

the company announces what it is going to do —
QUESTION:

No.

When the telephone company puts the

pen register on, all it monitors is what comes out.
MR. CARDIN;
QUESTION:

That is absolutely correct.
And the only thing it monitors is the

number and that is all.
MR. CARDIN:

And the time, I believe, it punshes out

the time.
QUESTION:
MR. CARDIN;

So none of the call is —
None of the call, the number of the

call and the time the call was made.
QUESTION:
for it?

And who pays for this, the government pays

34
HR. CARDIN %

I believe that the ~~ in the New York

Telephone Company case, it was indicated that the government
pays for the attaching of the device, yes.
So I would submit to the Court in conclusion that I
personally see no reason why this officer in this case could
not and should not have applied for a court order, and I
believe that precedent has been set in the federal courts of
fo 11 owing that precedent and i.s one that should be adopted
here.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICES

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case

is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:30 o'clock p.m. , the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
