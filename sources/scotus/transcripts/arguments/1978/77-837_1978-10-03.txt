P R O C E E D 1 N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 77-837, New Motor Vehicle Board of the State of
California against Fox, and 77-849, Northern California Motor
Car Dealers Association against Fox.
Mr. Mukai, I think you can proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. MUKAI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 77-837
MR. MUKAIs

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The issue in this case is whether a State must pro­
vide commercial enterprises, subject to its State regulatory
capacity, a hearing prior to obliging those enterprises to
delay consumation of certain commercial expectancies, pending
State inquiry in the regulatory interest.

This case arises

from a partial summary judgment entered in the Central District
of California declaring facially void and enjoining enforcement
of a motor vehicle dealership establishment and relocation
act of the State, which 7. shall refer to as the California
/

Automobile Franchise Act,
The judgment of the three-judge court holds that the
Act deprives franchisors and their business associates of
liberty and property without due process of law.
Now, Your Honors, with the Court’s permission, I

propose to focus my remarks principally upon the basic reason
that we contend the District Court ought not to have decided
this case at all.
Further, I propose, with the Court’s permission, to
defer to counsel for Appellants in No, 849,the discussion of the
alternative grounds for affirmance which have been urged by
the Appellee.
I would like to spend a few moments with the statute
in question.

That statute, in Section 3062 of the California

Vehicle Code, provides that in the event that a franchisor seeks
to establish or relocate a dealership within ten miles of one
of its existing dealerships, then the

franchisor must first .

notify the New Motor Vehicle Board of the State, an administra­
tive agency, and each of the franchisors, existing franchisees
in the same' line-make, within ten miles of the prospective
dealership site.
Any franchisee so notified, who is located within;'
ten miles of the proposed site, may then file a protest with
the New Motor Vehicle Board’within 15 days. When a protest has
been filed, the franchisor is prohibited from effectuating the
proposed establishment for relocation until a hearing has bean
held by the Board.
The California Vehicle Code, Section 6032, implements
this prohibition by requiring the Board, upon receipt of a
protest, to notify the franchisor first that a timely protest

5
has in fact been filed? second, that a hearing is required
t© b® held by the Board? and, third, that the franchisor
shall not establish or relocate the proposed dealership until
such time as the requisita hearing has bean held, nor
following the hearing, if the Board should determine that
good cause exists not to permit the dealership,
tod the Board notifications that were issued to
General Motors franchising divisions in this case are found at
pages 52 and 80 of the Joint Appendix,
I should add that the Act does require a full
evidentiary hearing within sixty days after a notice of
hearing has been issued by the Board,

As the District Court

itself noted, if the Board itself hears the protest, it must
is; ue its decision within thirty days after holding the
hearing, or else the franchisor's action for establishment
or relocation is c;samed approved by law,
QUESTION:

If no protest is filed, !&■ the approval

automatically forthcoming?
ME, MUKAIs

Your Honor, in the event that no protest

is filed, there is no further step to be taken by the Board
as an administrative agency, and the franchisor is permitted
to go ahead with his plans•
QUESTION:

What if the protest is filed and then

is withdrawn before the hearing?
MR, MUKAXs

If the protest is withdrawn prior to

6
the hearing, the Board issues a notice of dismissal of the
protest, and the franchisor is permitted to consummate its
plans,
QUESTION* So that the vindication of the public
interest, depends entirely on the activity of the protestor?

MR, MUEAX t

Not exactly, 'four Honor,

The Act

utilizes the protest as the means for bringing the public
interest to issue before the New Motor Vehicle Board,

In this

respect, California ■—
QUESTIONs But after it*s at issue, the protestor can
take it *»“ can withdraw?
MR. MURA!t

The Board has, in the past, taken the

position that although a protest may be withdrawn, the Board
is not automatically deprived of jurisdiction to regulate.
The order of dismissal ordinarily issues following the with­
draw! of the protest, but it is not required by lav; tc so issue
QUESTION* Who may protest?
" r:

MR, MUKAIs

Under the California statute, any .•

dealer in the same line-make as the proposed dealership to be
established or relocated,
QUESTION;

So no stranger or member of the public

may protest?
MR. MUKAIs

That is true, Your Honor.

However,

merits* rs of the public may appear at the hearing and be repre­
sented , and produce evidence and be heard fully at the evidenti

7
ary hearing prescribed by Section 3056 of the Vehicle Code,,
QUESTIONS

So an essis ting Ford dealer,» however, can

protest a new Chevrolet agency?
MR, MUKAX s
under the Act,,

No, Your Honor, that could not happen

Only an intra-brand .'situation exists here,

only a competitor in the same line*"make can protest.
QUESTIONS

Oh, I sae.

That means only a Pontiac

dealer can protest ■»«»

MRo MUKAXs
QUESTION:

Only a Pontiac automobile dealer.

'A Chevrolet

could protest the relocation

of a Pontiac dealer?
MR* MUKAIa

That is correct, Your Honor, yes.

QUESTION:

But the Ford dealer could go and get one

of his friends or a lot of his neighbors to go in, from what
you say? Just &e citizens.
MR* MUKAI:

That is possible, Your Honor, to 'the

extent —
QUESTION:

What would the citizens be presenting?

Whcvl’..s the ban is of their appearing?

Because there's too many

automobile dealers around the neighborhood?
MR* MUKAIs

That could certainly ha one basis.

QUESTION:

Well, that's a zoning matter, isn't it?

MR. MUKAI:

It borders on a zoning matter in many

instances, Your Honor, but the State's interest in this form
of regulation can take on many different aspects.

8
There could conceivably be a situation where a dis­
interested, in the sens© of purely private individuals could
take an interest in the number or tha location, perhaps the
location of —
QUESTION:
any

As a practical matter, do citizens have

— have any citizens ever appeared?
MR. MUKA1:

Your Honor, I can1fc answer that.

I'm

simply unaware of whether any citizens have ever appeared in
these kinds of proceedings*
QUESTION:

Could California pass the sarss law

involving gasoline stations?
MR, MUKAIi

Yes, Your Honor, it could.

QUESTIONi

Or any other business?

MR, MUKAXi

Virtually any other business, 1 am sure,

Your Honor, based upon, among other things, this Court's
}
decision, clarifying decision in Exxon Corperatiqn y„__Gq^a:cnoi:
of
Maryland.

&-xsn?V7z^~z>i~s~t

Your Honors, the District Court interpreted the Act
as rewiring th*: Board to sat a hearing date concurrent with
its issuance of the statutory notification to the franchisor.
But oven though, under this interpretation, tha period of
delay between invocation of the statute's prohibition and the
time of a final decision on “the merits is potentially as short
as ninety days, the Court held that the Act’s failure to
provide a hearing before imposing any delay or to require a

9

hearing soon thereafter9 constituted a deprivation of liberty
and property without due process of law®
In -the District Court, we cited the Chief Justice's
dissenting opinion in the 1971 case of Wisconsin vs. Constant
tineau0
QUESTION*
MRo MUKAI *

That won*t help you very much, will it?
That is exactly what Judge;

Ely said to

no s Your Honor „
[Laughter0]
MR, MUKAIs

But we cited it because we believed that

that dissent, which was concurred in by Mr, Justice Biackmims
has now become the rule for application of Pullman abstention
through this Court’s more recent decisions in. Harris County
CoHgp.isiuloners Court vt Moore „ decided in 1975, and the IS76
decision in Bellotti v« Baird, which was decided unanimously
by tills Court o
And that rule, we submit, is that the Pullman doctrina
applies even to an unambiguous statute which appears to foa in
conflict with accepted notions of due process,

if it is

susceptible of a State Court ruling, which would either avoid
the necessity of a federal constitutional decision or, in the
alternative, substantially modify the federal issue involved,
i.

In the present, case, entirely apart from the sugges**
tioh that the California Court, could invalidate the Act under
the State Constitution, we have submitted that this statute is

IO
susceptible of et least two constructions.

One of which would

avoid federal constitutional issue, and the other of which would
substantially modify it.
First, as was the case in Constanfcineau, this Act
could be construed to require a hearing before State action
occurs at all.

As California precedent for such a situation,

we have cited to the Court the case of Bndler va. Scln&tsbank,
involving a Real Estate Commissioner1s case in California, and
Rloa vs. Cozens, heard in this Court, sub nom Department of
Motor Vehicles vs. Rios.

r'"ftir».tawiwcFa.v-ry"«-«jw

•AppeEees point out in their brief that w© have never
affirmatively advocated this construction, and of course this

is true, because we do not believe that the Act interferes witr.
v.

Xihv.rty or a property interest, and because w© do not believe

that due process requires a prior hearing, even if some such
interest is involved in this case.
QUESTIONt

Rs 1 understand it, Mr. Mukai, your fellow

appellants have expressly abandoned the claim that the Court
should have abstained on the Pullman mattery is that correct?
MRo MUKAI:
QUESTION:
MR. MUKAI:

Yes, Your Honor, as we understand —
I was looking at your reply brief.
As we understand the appellants in the

consolidated appeal, they believe that this statute is totally
unambiguous.
QUESTION:

Well,, in any event, perhaps even though

II
the Court could have abstained, that it’s almost moot now, and
academic, since the Court did decide it on the merits, they
asked us to decide it on the merits.

That's the way I read

thair reply brief.
MR. HUKAI s

That is my understanding, Your Honor,

and that9a why X feel that itse important that X bring at
least one ambiguity to this Court's attention.

And that is the

second interpretation which we have advocated affirmatively,
and it's the interpretation which would substantially modify
the due process issue dealt with by the District Court.
That interpretation would hold that the Act requires
the manufacturer to provide notice to the Board and to its
franchisees before its commitment to its plans has advanced so
far that the manufacturer simply cannot hear the delays of
State regulation.
This interpretation focuses on the first words of
Vehicle Code Section 3062, which is the crux of this case.
Those wards ares

"In the event that a franchisor seeks to enter

into a franchise establishing an additional dealership or
relocating an existing dealership.**
The interpretation which we have advocated would
settle the time-related ambiguity these first words present,
and the necessity of such an interpretation is demonstrated
by the facts that the Fox enfranchisement and the Muller

12

relocation in this very case presented situations where,, in
neither case* did General Motors' notice of intent precede
finalization of its plans with those dealers? and in both
cases General Motors waited to give notice until after it had
already entered into the franchises with its respective dealers.
In fact* in the case of Fox* General Motors didn't
give notice at all until some three months after the franchise
became effective.
Now* appellees*' due process claim rests* at least in
part* on the assertion of the protected property right by
virtue of contractual arrangements regarding its franchise.
If a State Court were to interpret this section to require the
manufacturer to issue its notice at some time before these
contractual arrangements are mace and finalized* then there
could be no basis whatsoever for the due process claim
predicated on the existence of contract.
In addition* if some liberty or property interest is
implicated by tills statute* the determinants of what process is
due would be completely different because of the nature of the
so-called right that is being interfered with.

In that

situation -QUESTIONj

Mr. Mukal* may I ask a question on this?

Supposing there's an existing Ford dealership at a
given location* and General Motors is negotiating with that
dealer to become a Chevrolet dealership., would the statute

13
apply If the Ford dealer switched to Chevrolet?
MR» MUKAIs

Yes, it would# Your Honor,,

QUESTION? So that you are# in effect# saying that you
ask the statute be construed that before negotiations go too
far# General Motors give notice to Ford that it’s soliciting
one of its dealers?
MR» MUKAIs

We advocate the interpretation that this;

is what the statute requires# Your Honor# based upon the
language# "In the event that” and "seeks to enter into*»

I

think the language is clearly anticipatory»
QUESTION 3
MR» MUKAIs

Yes o
If the Court please# I will reserve any

remaining tins I may have for rebuttal»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well,

Mr, McCall»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R» McCALL, ESQ»#
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO» 77-849
MR. McCALLs

Mr, Chief Justice# and may it please

the Courts
Mr» Justice Stewart has accurately stated our position
in reference to the abstention issue»

It is the position of

the dealer association appellants here that abstention of the
Pullman variety is an equitable doctrine»

At this point it

serves no useful purpose to say the District Court should have
abstained

14
I would like to pass momentarily to the due process
clause attack which was brought on

the statute, and which was

the specific ground on which the District Court held that the
statute was facially invalid.
It is our position that there is no conceivable
liberty or property interest which can be made out by General
Motors or the other appellees,

The long and short of it is

that they assert, the right to establish an automobile franchise
or to be coma a franchise dealer whenever they want and wherever
they want, .
And we submit that this is not the type of liberty
or property concept which has been given due process procedural
protection by. this Court, ever.
One other point with reference to the due process
clause, and that is that the appellees in their brief have
stated that if the due process procedural protections are
not available to General Motors, Fox and Muller in this
situation, then they have no protection whatsoever under the due
process clause.
sustain.

That seems to bs a statement which is hard to

Clearly, there is a notion of substantive due process

in the sense that all State-regulations ~ economic enterprises
as well as other enterprises and other activity ~ must be
rationally related to legitimate end of government.
Clearly, we submit, and we have submitted this in
our reply brief, this kind of legislation is indeed rationally

15
related to the legitimate end of government.

The Automobile

Dealers Day in Court Act on the federal level is an express
recognition by Congress of the inadequate status at the
bargaining table, if you will, which dealers have when they
bargain with automobila manufacturers.

The problem of over­

loading, in terms of putting in too many dealerships of the
same line-make in one marketing area, has brought a number o£
States other than California to the same position.

In other

words, some form of legislation which limits the carte blanche
authority of the manufacturer to establish a new or additional
dealership in a given market area.
Nineteen States have statutes which are similar to
California in that respect.

Eleven of these States, of these

nineteen, have a board or an official State body that passes
upon or supervises or looks over, in some way, this decision
by the manufacturer to put in an additional dealership in an
area already served by a dealer carrying the same line-make.
QUESTIONS

But, Mr. McCall, isnst it true that some

of the companies have arbitrations?
MR. McCALLs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION?

Like General Motors, I know has one; do

the others have it, too?
MR. McCALLs As far as I know, Ford is the only
manufacturer that has an arbitration, institutionalized
arbitration arrangement, which is —*

NR* McCALLs

I'm not familiar with it,

if they do.

A former member of this Court —

arbitrator? maybe it was a different title.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

He was promoted to arbitrator.
Yes, to resolve differences between

General Motors on the one hand, and its distributors and
dealers on the other. At least that was ray understanding.
MR. HcCALL:

That would appear to be a recognition

by the commercial entities involved as a need for some kind of
regulation of this activity, and clearly Congress and the other
State Legislatures have felt the same way.

Other State

Legislatures besides California.
I would like to pass to the supremacy clause argument
which is made by General Motors in this case.

It was not the

ground on which Judges Ely and Gray and Takasugi relied down
below, but it was urged to the District Court.
As I take it, the supremacy clause argument here is
that since the California Act, Automobile Franchise Dealers Act,
imposes some limitation upon the total freedom of General
Motors to put a dealership in wherever and whenever they want
to, that this somehow conflicts with the central policy of the

3.7
Sherman Act*
Now*, at the present time I know of no case# and I
certainly would stand corrected on this# where this Court has
voided a State statute on the grounds that it conflicts with
the Sherman Act»

This Court has voided activities of price-

fixing by attorneys# has said that monopolistic practices on
the part of utilities# municipally owned and otherwise# -are
subject to the antitrust laws; but it.has not struck down a
State statute on the ground that it conflicted with the anti­
trust laws»
The California Supreme Court has struck down its
liquor fair pricing law recently# in a case which is cited in
our reply br5,ef# but# as far as I know# this Court has not,
I would make so bold as to postulate that there would
have to be two steps in any such analysis# which would have
to be undergone before a State statute could be struck down on
the ground that it "violates the Sherman Act" or "violates
the

central policy of the Sherman Act”„
First# it would seem to me it would have to be shown

that the State statute authorizes conduct which# but for the
State statute# would violate the Sherman Act*
And# secondly# that the statute authorises conduct
which is not "State action"# as that phrase has come to be
defined in a number of decisions which this Court has rendered.
Obviously State action itself cannot be illegal undes:

18
the Sherman Act f and that dates from Parker vs. Brown, and
that is a concept never questioned by this Courts subsequently,
So what we are talking about here is an attack on the
only private conduct which is really authorized, by this Act,
and that is the right of a dealer to protest to this Board.
That is the only conduct undertaken by a private party.
Novj, we submit
QUESTION:

Is that quite right# Hr. McCall?

Isn’t

it correct that the private party could — all the dealers
within ten miles of the now location could agree with one
another that they would let General Motors open a new dealer*»
ship# provided General Motors paid them a certain amount or
gave them some consideration# couldn’t they?

Without any

State involvement at all.
MR. McCALLs
authorized by the Act.

by Idle statute.

Mr. Justice Stevens# that’s not
That’s not conduct which is authorized

It might be undertaken# certainly.

QUESTION: As I understand it# basically what the Act
does is give any dealer within the ten-mile radius the right
to

> !:You cannot open the dealership without paying the

amount of money involved in conducting an evidentiary hearing
of some kind.'5

And if# instead of doing that# the dealers said#

"Well# if you just give us $5#000 apiece# you go ahead.”

The

public wouldn't care then# would they?
MjRo McCALL:

I think there would be problems under

19

the antitrust, laws, with tha —
QUESTIONt

Well, you admit, then, there would, be a

problem under the antitrust laws?
MRe McCALL:

Oh, yes, the collective agreement, sure,

between them, to engage in such extortion or shakedown„
Certainlyo

I think that could be cognisable under the antitrust

laws and perhaps under some other laws*
QUESTION t

Would it be illegal for General Motors to

adopt a policy in California that when they open a new dealer­
ship they give notice to all the dealers that raif you don't
protest, we’ll hand you $10,000®, they send out a notice of
that kind?
MR0 McCALL:
QUESTIONS

It would; be a unilateral act*
And than they all decides

well, that'3

better than going through the cost of hearings•
MR* McCALL:

Well, each of the dealers decide on

•their own that yes, they will take the $10,000?

I see nothing

wrong with General Motors adopting that —
QUESTION s That would be consistent with the policy
that this statute is indicating, isn’t it?

Namely, protecting

those dealers from excessive competition*
MR0 McCALL:

If the dealers felt that excessive

competition was worth —
QUESTION:

More than $10,000, they'd say, "Well,

we won’t take tha ten, but give us fifteen*15

20

MR. McCALL:
QUESTION:

Right.
Is the antitrust issue here?

Or the pre­

emption issuee the supremacy issue?
MR. McCALL:
QUESTION:

Yes. As I understand it, that3s what —
That is the «appellee urges that for

affirmance?
MR. McCALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And was that presented in the District
Court?
MR. McCALL:

Yes, it was.

It was one of the grounds

in the motion for summary judgment.
QUESTION:

But it was not dealt with by the District

Court?
MR. McCALL:

No,

Tha District Court specifically

said it dic'-n* t have to reach that issue, because it was going
off on its notion of procedural due process,
QUESTION;

Isn’t that somewhat unusual when the

District Court is presented with both a statutory claim and a
constitutional claim, for it to decide tha constitutional claim
in preference to the statutory claim?
MR. McCALL:

Well, of course, tha statutory claim is

based on the supremacy clause.
QUESTION:

It would seem to me —

But we'vs classified the supremacy

issues for purposes of this policy with statutory issues.
MR. McCALL:

Well, it would seem unusual to me, yes.

21
QUESTIONS Well* what — do you suggest that if we
must deal

if that issue is in the case* that wo pass on it

here, or that we remand it?
MR, McCAlL:

My position — I would prefer to have

this Court pass on it* myself.

At this point.

It seems to me

the precedents are clear* and it's a point that could be
passed on under the precedents that you have.

Because it was

urged to the lower court.
If I may proceed on my concept that the conduct here
would not be illegal* even if there were no statute* the
conduct authorized* that is, a right to protest to the
government,
I would call to the Court’s attention or remind it o:
the cases* the decisions it has rendered in Noerr and in the

cases * holding that the -«*
