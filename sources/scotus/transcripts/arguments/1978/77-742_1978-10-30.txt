MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bargiel, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BARG ILL., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BA'RGIEL:

Mr. Chief Justice», and may it please

the Court:
This case began in January of 1974 when the Plain­
tiffs filed their complaint against the Department of Children
and Family Services of the State of Illinois In the Federal
District Court for the Northern District; of Illinois.
The complaint challenged the Illinois policy of re­
fusing foster care payments to persons who cared for children
who were related to them and to the children themselves.
Illinois based its policy of refusing foster care payments to
relatives upon its determination first» that assistance had
always been provided to related parsons and to children under
the basic AFDC program contained in Section 406 of the Social
Security Act» and,secondly» upon the determination that Section
403 of the Social Security Act defined those eligible for
foster care benefits as caretakers and children who were un­
related to each other.
The Plaintiffs in this case are caretakers and
children who

are related to each other and, thus, are denied

\

4

foster care benefits under Illinois policy»

Their complaint

alleged a cause of action that the Illinois scheme was in
violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights of fiquai
Protection*

The Department of Children and Family Services

filed a motion to strike and dismiss the Plaintiff’s complaint
which the three-judge court,which was impaneled to hear this
case,treated .as a motion for summary judgment*

The three-

judge court held that the Illinois policy of denying foster
care benefits to children who are related to their caretakers
was not a denial of equal protection»

That cage was appealed

directly to this Court and the Plaintiffs, in their jurisdic­
tional statement, urged in addition to their equal protection
claim, for the very first time, that the Illinois policy or
scheme of denying benefits was inconsistent with the Federal
Social Security Act, and therefore there was a violation of
the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution»
Because this claim had not previously been presented
to the three-judge court, this Court reversed the three-judge
court's decision and remanded the case to the three-judge
court for consideration of this issue»

On remand, the single

judge of the District Court found that the Illinois scheme of
denying foster care benefits to related caretakers was in­
consistent with the Social Security Act, and therefore a
violation of the Supremacy Clause.
The Department of Children and Family Services

5
appealed this decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals»
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District
Court's determination,

The Department of Children and Family

Services then filed a notice of appeal to this Court and sub­
sequently its jurisdictional statement urging that it® policy
of denying fester care benefits to related persons was consis­
tent with the Social Security Act® and this Court noted probable
jurisdiction on the 21st of February 1378.
QUESTION:

Mr, Attorney General® are there many other

states that follow Illinois• lead here?
MR. BARGXEL:
Illinois lead.

There are other states which follow

I believe that the briefs indicate that there

are six or seven states who are doing this.

I believe® however®

that the majority of states who are involved in the program
now take the contrary position® that is® that foster care may
be related care.
The issue in this case® I think® may be simply stated.
It is are children who are related to their caretakers® are
the children® themselves® eligible for foster care assistance
under Section 408 of the Social Security Act?
It is our position that this case involves® essenti­
ally® a question of statutory construction.

And it is also

our position that Section 408 of the Social security Act® by
its clear terms® indicates that foster care means unrelated
care.

Since our case turns entirely upon a proper reading of

6
the statute* I would like to devote the remainder of my time
to a reading of the statute to show the Court what we believe
to be the clear indication in the statute itself that foster
care is unrelated care.
The statute is contained in an Appendix to our
Jurisdictional Statement.

It is Appendix A.

it is contained at page A6 of. that Appendix.

In Section 608,
And that is what

I want to devote my argument to, if 2 may.
Section 608 is entitled, "Payment to States for
Foster Home Care of Dependent Children, Definitions."
paragraph A defines the term "dependent child."
follows:

Mow,

It reads a®

"The term 'dependent child' shall notwithstanding

Section 606(a) of this title also include a child."
I would like to focus, if I may, on two words in
one of the phrases that are used in those two lines.
first word is the word "notwithstanding."

The

Notwithstanding,

according to its common useage means, in spite of.

So the

term "dependent child" in Section 608 is going to be a child
who in spite of Section 606(b) of this title.

--- I am sorry,

in spite of Section 606(a) of this title.
Mow, Section 606(a) is the regular AFDC program,
and it provides that children will be eligible for assistance
if they live with a specified relative.

If Section 608, which

defines the term "dependent child" as one that Is a child in
spite of the definition contained in Section 606(a), it must

7
indicate an intention on the part of Congress to create a
class which is different than the class which was already
created in Section 606»

We read that* of course# since the

child who was eligible in 6o5 was a child who was living with
a specified relative -- We read that as being .-«"i the Section_608
child as being someone who is not living with a specified
relative»
Congress also chose the word -» chose to include the
word "also."

That is after the tern "dependent child shall not­

withstanding Section 606(a) of this title#" they said "it shall
also include a child» . ."

Now# the word "als<V' as it is

commonly used# means in addition to besides or as well as»
So# the definition in 608 of "dependent child" is a
definition in addition to or besides or as well as the defini­
tion in 606(a)»

Again# since the definition in 606(a) requires

a dependent child to be living with a specified relative# the
definition in 608 must be something different»

And we contend

again that that is further indication that the difference is
that the child is going to be unrelated to his caretaker in
608.
Paragraph 1 indicates that "the term 'dependent child'
shall notwithstanding Section 606(a) of this title also include
a child who would meet the requirements of such .Section 606(a)
except for his removal from the hone of a relative specified
in Section 606(a),"

8
So, under paragraph A-l# a dependent child is a chile
who notwithstanding the provisions of Section 606 shall include
also a child who would be eligible under Section 606 but for
his removal from the hcrae of a specified relative.
We submit that this is, again,, an indication of the
fact that Congress intended to create a new class of persons
here under Section 608,and that new class of persons who are
going to be eligible for care are persons who are unrelated
to the persons for whom -« or by whom they are given care.
QUESTION:

You are saying that the language, "except

for his removal from the heme by judicial decree," suggests
that 606(a) would exclude those people, and that 608 would
put them back in.
MR. BARGIEL:

That le correct, Your Honor.

That is

precisely our position.
One of the reasons we take that position is that
children who were removed from the home of a relative pursuant
to a judicial determination that that home was no longer fit
were • always

children who were eligible for assistance under

the basic AFDC program contained in Section 606.

Congress did

not need to pass Section 608 in order to provide eligibility
for children who were removed from, the home of one relative
pursuant to a judicial determination and placed in the heme
of another relative.

Those kind of children were always

covered under the basic AFDC program.

9
It is our position then* since Congress didn't need
to do that5 it must have been their intention to create a
new class of persons who would be eligible for assistance»
That new class of persons, of course, are persons who are
unrelated to their caretakers because they were never eligible
for assistance under the basic AFDC program.
I might add Congress, too, throughout the definition
of dependent child her®,has contrasted the definition of de­
pendent child in Section 608 with the definition of dependent
child in Section 606.

I think that contrast was intended to

demonstrate that the class of children who are going to be
eligible for assistance under Section 608 is a different class
than the one in Section 6o6,
Now, on page A7 of the brief, at paragraph B, the
Congress has also defined the term "aid to families with de­
pendant children."

They do that in the same fashion as they

have defined the term "dependent child" in paragraph A.

They

say "the term 'aid to families - with id ©pendent children' shall,
notwithstanding Section 606B of this title, include also i oster
care in behalf of a child described in paragraph. A,"
The term "aid to families with dependent children"
in Section 606(a), which is the basic AFDC foster program,
means aid to a family who is taking care of a child who is
related to that family.

If Section 608, which is the new

program, foster care program, is created notwithstanding

10

S@ct.lon 606(a)*, again* It must be another indication that
Congress intended to create a new class of persons.

And*

again* that new class of persons are families who are not
related to the children that they live with.
Mow* I think* too*that the Plaintiff© recognize*
in this case* that that language notwithstanding — notwith­
standing Section 606(a) or notwithstanding Section 606(b) in
the term also — presents a problem to their interpretation of
the statute»

1 would say that because they define Section

608(b) »- that is* they define the term "aid to families with
dependent children" at page 35 of their brief.
interesting to note the way they do that.

I think it is

Page 35*> at the

bot trail* of Appellees’ brief* quotes from Congress* statute*
Section 608(b).

They say it is given a specific meaning* and

the meaning they give it reads as follows:

They say*"the term*

’aid to families with dependent children/ shall include foster
care in behalf of a child described in paragraph (a) of this
section,"
What is significant about that is that they have
deleted the very language which I think indicates Congress'
intention to create a new class of children.

It reads* "the

tern ’aid to families with dependent children3shall*" and then
the phrase*

"nothwithstanding Section 606(b)*" is deleted,

QUESTION: But this also on A 7 includes child care
institutions * too, which are not involved in this at all.

11

MR, BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

That, is correct. Your Honor.

It also Includes 606(a)(1).

What is this,

just a hodge-podge, here?
MR. BARGIEL:
QU£STIQN:
it.

I am sorry, Your Honor, I don't —

That's my problem,

I don't understand

You understood it,
MR, BARGIEL:

Well, our position is that eligibility

is defined in Section 6o8, in terms of a dependent child or a
family with whom that child is living.

Once that child is

eligible, that child may be eligible for foster care in a
family home or may be eligible for foster care in a child care
institution.

What I am focusing on and what this case is all

about, in my estimation, is who is eligible for the benefits
which are provided for in 608.

And I am saying the Congress

defined who. is eligible when they defined the term "dependent
child" and when they defined it as being a new definition not­
withstanding the old definition, which was contained in the
basic AFDC program.
I would like to point out again the Plaintiffs
exclude in their reading of that definition -QUESTION:

Why is it that in this case this is not

included In all of this language on page A6 and Ajt which I
don11 unders tand ?
MR, BARGIEL:
QUESTION:

Why Is what not Included, Your Honor?

The Respondents in this case.

12

MR. BARGIEL:

QUESTION:

I am sorry* I do not «■-

You say you will not pay these people that

are in this case* right?
MR, BARGIEL:

That is our position.

Our position Is

that —
QUESTION:

My question is:

MR» BARGIEL:

Why? W-h-y?

Our position is we will not pay them

because Congress did not define them as a class which was
eligible for assistance under Section S08 of this program.
They are eligible for assistance under Section 606 by its
literal terms* and they have always been eligible under Section

606 by its literal terms.

Congress created a new class of

persons in Section 608* a class of persons who were formerly
ineligible to receive any benefits.

Before 608 was created*

any child who was unable to live with a relative specified in
Section 606 was ineligible for AFDC* could receive no benefits
whatsoever* no matter -QUESTION:

What about 607?

MR, BARGIEL:

I

Well* 607 requires that a child live

with a specified relative again* and be deprived of parental
support because his father is on*unemployment.
cisely our point.

That’s pre­

Under those programs a child would be

eligible for assistance if he had the ability to live with a
specified relative.

But children who could not live with a

relative were not eligible for any assistance at all.

And

13
when Congress passed this program, ifc is our position that
they did ifc wifch the intention of benefiting a class of
children who were previously ineligible for any kind of assis­
tance afc all.
As the Solicitor General points out in his brief,
too, I might add, there was no controversy in this case until
the monetary benefits for foster care were increased beyond
what the basic AFDC program provided for»

But when this

program was initially enacted in 1961 -- that is the foster
care program -- when ifc was initially enacted in 1961, the
benefits, as I understand ifc, were precisely the same for the
basic program as they were for the foster care program,

Now,

it seems to me, if the benefits were the same when the program
was created and they weren't increased until 1967 -- if the
benefits were the same, that must Indicate that Congress Intended afc that time to benefit a new class of persons, one who
had been previously without any kind of assistance afc all,
because the benefits were precisely the same.
At any rate, my point is that the only way that
the Plaintiffs can wind up being eligible for assistance under
this program is to exclude the language which I have said, as
they have done at page 35 of their brief.
In order to be eligible for foster care or in order
for the state to be able to receive matching benefits for
foster care, they have to

Under Section 608(f), they have

14

to provide a program which is designed fco Improve the condi­
tions in the home from which the child was removed, or fco
otherwise make possible its being placed in the home of a
relative specified in Section 606(a) of this title.
It is our position that If the state has to provide
a program which will put a child -- take a child out of foster
care and put him in the home of a specified relative, that has
no significance or no meaning if the child is already in the
home of a relative,because the goal of Section 608 is not
satisfied«,

That is fco say that a child -- there is no purpose

or point in taking a child out of the home of one relative and
putting him in the home of another relative*

This language of

Congress in Section 608(f), in our view, has no significance
whatever.

If the statute is interpreted fco permit foster care

by relatives, it has no meaning.
Based upon our reading of the statute and the
reading which I have attempted to engage in here before the
Court, it is our position that foster care means unrelated
care.

It is clear, even if it is implicit, in the statute.
QUESTION:

Do you think it means that in the

ordinary vernacular?
MR* BARGIEL:

Do I think it means unrelated <2-

care in the ordinary vernacular?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR® BARGIE-U:

I did until

15
QUESTION:

Until you read the statutes.

MR. BARGIEL:

No, no, until I read the dictionary

definitions, not until I read the statutes.

It is clear in my

mind that Congress intended foster care to be unrelated care
because of the way they defined the tern®, "dependent child"
and "aid to families with dependent children."
I think that the term "foster care" may vary from
parson to person or Individual to individual.

As the

Plaintiffs point out, "foster" may imply the relationship
between a child and his caretaker, that is anyone who provides
what the mother or father would provide would be considered
to be a foster parent.

I will concede that that’s true, but

I don't think that our case turns on that understanding.

We

rely on the plain language that Congress used in the doclal
Security Act.

And it is our position that based upon that

language and our reading of it, which I think is not a selec­
tive reading, but a fair reading, foster care means unrelated
care.
In order for the Plaintiffs to include themselves
in this category, to make themselves eligible, they have to
engage in a selective reading of the statute.

They have to

read cut x-^ords and phrases, because they can't read them con­
sistently and make all the terms and all of the provisions of
the fester care statute have significance or make sense.
I v/ould like to reserve whatever time I have left

16
for rebuttal1 would simply ask the Court that they reverse
the judgment on order of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Lehrer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT £. LEHRER * ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LEHRER:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether a
neglected or abused child judicially taken from his own home
may be deprived of Federal foster care benefits solely because
hi© state then places him in the home of his relatives.
The Department of Health* Education* and Welfare*
with the children here* says the Congress intended no such
deprivation.

Illinois says the Congress intended precisely

that deprivation.

By affirming the Court of Appeals' decision

here* this Court will effectuate Congress' intent these
neglected or abused children be cared for under the Federal
foster care program* which is intended to insure these chil­
dren the most suitable oufc-of«home care for them.
The state Defendant says the benefits here are the
same and tries to make the program sort of the duplicate of the
assistance programs. The programs do not provide duplicate
assistance today and they did not provide it in 1961,

Section

408 provides* in Section (f) and in the Service Component to

17

the Licensing Standards, a range of social services which is
specifically designed to meet the needs of neglected or abused
children who have been removed from their own homes and made
state wards.

These services are provided fco assure the child

proper care in the foster family home or child care institution
in which he is placed* and also are provided to the child and
to the parent from whom he was taken* in order to effect a reunification of the family.
QUESTION:

Doesn't 608(f)* in the vary language you

just quote* suggest that Congress was thinking about two dif­
ferent classes of children in 608 and In 606?
MR. LEHRER:

No, Your Honor.

I don't believe that is the case.

With all due respect,

The character of the ser­

vices applies to a class of children who have been abused or
neglected in their own homes, not just to abused or neglected
children who have been placed in the homes of nonrelafcives.
The required services under the Federal Act require an in­
dividualized social service plan to assure the child proper
care in the home in which he is placed, and also provide for
services to, not only him, but to the parent in the home from
which he was removed in order to effectuate a reunification
in the family.

The character of those services is no less

applicable to children who are placed with relatives then
those placed with nonrelatives,
There is just as much a need to remedy the neglect

13

and deprivation of children placed with relatives by effecting
a reunification of the family as the children placed with nonrelatives,

do* the service component here, which Is not only

reflected in (f), but also reflected in the licensing or
approval standards, is responsive to the abuse or ntglacb and
it doesn't go alone to children who are placed in nonrelated
homes ,
For instance, the service component of the license
standards, which all states, under (f), are required to apply
to eligible children and which Illinois applies to related
homes here -«*
QUESTION:

But your definition of "eligible children"

comes from 606(a), doesn't it?
MR, EEHRER:

Well, the definition of"eligible

children" comes from 606(a) but it turns — at least, In
part — eventually on the last paragraph of 608(a),

Because

the state's contention here is, as the Court of Appeals noted
and the state says In.its brief, "turns on the statutory
definition of '.foster family home*,"
QUESTION:

In Section 608(a), this --

Doesn't it also turn on the definition

of "dependent child" in 608(a)?
MR, LEHRER:

Most certainly, Your Honor.

And what

Section 608(a) is doing is defining, establishing a new
program and setting forth new eligibility standards which a
child may meet and be a dependent child.

It is redefining the

19
tern, "dependent child»"
QUESTION:

What do you make of the language that

your opponent relies on in the first part of 608(a)(1) there#
that "a dependent child shall also include a child who would
meet the requirements of Section 606(a) or Section 607# except
for his removal from the home of a relative"?

Does that sug­

gest to you that a child who is removed from the heme of a
relative by judicial decree would not# except for 608# meet
the requirements of 606 or 607?
MR. LEHRE-R:

No.

If I understand your question

properly# the language that Defendant makes so much of is
language that supports the conclusion that the children here
are eligible,
Vihat Section 608 is doing -- Section 408 of the Act
is doing is to make irrelevant the definition in 606.

That's

whafc "notwithstanding" suggests# that here# notwithstanding
the definition of "dependent child" in 406# here Is a new set
of eligibility criteria# which -«
QUESTION:

Then you get all your rights from Section

608?
MR. LEHRER:

Prom Section 608# oh# yes# except# I

think# as Defendants take pains to point out# that this statu­
tory definition does have to be interpreted in the context of
its statutory environment# particularly Section 601.

Section

42# USC# Section 601# which provides that the primary purpose

20

of the program -- one of the primary purposes of all the
AFDC programs is to encourage the care of dependent children
in their own hones or in the homes of relatives.
It does -« our rights -- straightforward we do have
to turn on Section 608, but it has to be interpreted in the
light of Section 401.

It is the state's policy here which

frustrates the primary purpose of all the AFDC programs,
What's happening here is you have Congress in 1956 amending
the Social Security Act to state specifically that one of the
primary purposes of all the AFDC programs is to encourage the
care of dependent children in their own homes or in the homes
of relatives.
The import of the state's position is that five
years later Congress establishes a new AFDC program which
frustrates precisely those goals.
precisely this way.

And it frustrates it in

The state's policy serves as a disincen­

tive, in the first instance, for relatives to care for depen­
dent children, as happened in this case.
As happened in this case, the Youakim's were dis­
couraged from taking care of children who were related to
them.

That's the first way it discourages the primary purpose

of the AFDC programs,
The second way is that even If that disincentive is
overcome and the children are, as they were here, placed in
the homes of relatives, then the state policy denies them the

21

services specified in Section 608(f)® designed precisely to
reunify the family, that is® place him back in his own home»
It is most unreasonable to read Section 408 of the
Act to frustrate what Congress five years previously had said
were the primary purposes of all the AFDC programs,
... So® it was not true in 1961 and it is not true today
that the programs provide duplicate assistance»

Although® as

Defendant points out® there was no higher Federal matching
rate in 1961 for these benefits -- In fact® all the states®
immediately®, even though there was no higher Federal matching
rate® immediately began paying substantially higher benefits.
And this reflects a recognition by the state that what was
meant here was a program to care for children who needed
special remedial care® who needed more benefits»
Nov;® in 1967® when the matching rate was increased®
what Congress said in providing those increased matching
benefits® was that the benefits were necessary because foster
care was more costly than care in a child’s home® and also
that it was responsive to the needs of the child»
And that’s what’s going on here.

Congress established

a new program to meet the needs of these children® these chil­
dren who have been especially -«* have grown up in unsuitable
environments and have been subject to abuse or neglect.
is a remedial program.

It

This is not simply a program for

children who don’t happen to have a relative to live with.

22

In facti,

Defendant's argument would suggest,

most children who don't have relatives to live with aren't
eligible for the foster care program.

This was not a new

comprehensive program to take care of children who didn't
happen to have a relative to live with.

What it was was a new

program to take care of children who have been subject to abuse
02"*

neglect in their own homes.

It is a small program especi­

ally designed to meet the needs of children unfortunate enough
to have grown up in those sorts of environments.
In Illinois, for instance, there are over 500,000
children eligible for regular AFDC benefits, but the entire
A-FDC foster care program includes only 4,000 children.

So,

we are talking about a small group of children here.
Now, Defendants place great reliance on the statute.
We think they are proper to place great reliance on the statute,
but they draw the wrong conclusions for it.

The statute, very

persuasively, as the Solicitor points out, supports the con»
elusion that the children here are eligible for foster care
benefits.
We discussed the statute at length In our brief, but
there are four points that merit emphasis here.
the statutory definition of "foster family home."

First, is
Second, is

the specification that AFDC shall include foster care to an
eligible child in the foster family home of any individual.
Third, Is the provision within the statutory definition that

23

foster family homes In which eligible children are placed may
be approved as meeting licensing standards.

This is a pro­

vision which is specifically applicable fco states in which
relative homes are not licensed.

And fourth is Section 402

(a)(l9)(f)* the related provision of the Act which constitutes
a specific Congressional recognition of a relative home as a
foster family home.
First, the statutory definition of fosfcer family
home.

Defendant dismisses the significance of this because

of the statutory definitions' repetition of the defined term,
"foster family home," in the definition itself.
from the last paragraph of Section 408:

Reading now

"In fact, the repeti­

tion of the term suggests a Congressional wariness that any
paraphrase of that term might be read fco restrict the state's
authority to place a child in the home in which it might be
most suitable."
Thus, the only restrictions on fosfcer family homes
are those fchr-fc the state places upon the home Itself, in terns
of the home's suitability.

But, that aside, --

Mr. Justice White, you look a bit confused
MR. JUSTICE WHITE:
MR. LEHRER:

I do.

I am sorry.

That's just normal.
I thought you wanted fco

ask a question.
The use of the defined term, "fosfcer family home,"
is no reason fco stop reading the definition.

The definition

24

goes on to say that a foster family home must at least be a
home for children and it must be licensed or approved by the
stateo

The purpose of the licensing or approval requirement

was to assure that the homes in which eligible children were
placed met state qualitative standards and state standards
which must govern their suitability.
In Illinois, as in all states, caretakers of state
foster children and their homes are required to and do meet
the same qualitative standards as apply to hcanes caring for
nonrelative foster children.

These qualitative standards,

which I have reviewed summarily before, mandate that the home
meet specified safety and health standards and prescribed
minimum safety requirements, and the caretakers themselves
must meet certain — must pass inspection as to their health
and their overall fitness to care for these children.
In short, except for purposes of AFDC foster care
eligibility, Illinois deems the related caretakers here to be
foster parents just in the same manner as it does unrelated
caretakers.

Defendants continually kind of group the related

caretakers here with relatives under the regular AFDC program.
But, in fact, the relatives here and the hones here just aren't
any relatives and they aren't any homes.

These are relatives

and homes which have been especially approved by the state
under state lav/ to be suitable for the care of children who
have been abused or neglected in their own homes and then

25

taken from those homes and made state wards.

So» the grouping

the Defendants try to effectuate is belied by its own law and
its own practice and policy.
Mr, Chief Justice Burger» in this context and in the
context of the statutory definition of foster family home»
which is the determlnantive tern in theccase — in that context»
the state's argument really rests upon a proposition that
Congress meant to simply exclude them -- exblude foster rela­
tive homes from the meaning — exclude relative homes from the
meaning of foster family homes* in the first instance.
As in Mr, Chief Justice Burger's question» counsel
conceded that* in fact» the ordinary use of the word may often
carry with it* and usually does carry with it» as we discussed
at length in our brief» the meaning of relative care.

As a

matter of fact* in this Court's previous opinion in this case»
it used the term "related foster care" and "related foster
parents" or "related foster home»" without any apparent
ease or strain associated with that tem.

That's the common

ordinary meaning of that term, and that's the meaning which
Congress attributed to it in the foster care statute.
The second point of the statute which I emphasize
is Section 408(b) which refers to the AFDC» "the term AFDC
shall notwithstanding Section 606(b) of this Title include
also foster care in behalf of the child described in (a) in
a foster family home of any individual." The term "of any

26

individual" explicates the term "foster family hone."

It

demonstrates what is otherwise clear from the legislative
history and from the logic of the statute that Congress meant
to Include any individual the state might deem to be a suitable
caretaker for its foster children as APDC foster parents.
What Individuals might be AFDC foster parents?
Section 408(b)* when read with the statutory definition* says
that any individual may be* so long as the state deems them
suitable under its licensing standards* which Illinois does
for relatives*
Finally* there is the

or third* there is the

approval provision* Section 4 — in the last paragraph of
Section 408* which provides that a foster family home may be
either licensed or approved as meeting licensing standards.
The legislative history does not indicate specifically why
this approval procedure was included »- alternate approval
procedure -- was included in the statute*

But* we do know

that in 1961* as today* several states exclude relative hones
from licensing in the first instance*

And* in that light*

it is most logical to read that insertion of the approval
procedure as Congress' effort — Congress' mandate that
children placed in such homes* that those homes meet the same
standards as were applied to homes which were licensed under
state law*
In this context* the approval requirement emerges

27

as Congress8 means of insuring that the children placed in those
hemes -» the relative homes — would receive the same benefits
as children placed In homes which weren't licensed *

But there

obviously would have been no reason for Congress to Include
that alternate provision unless it intended that children
placed in relative homes would be eligible for the foster care
program,
The fourth point in the statute which I would empha­
size — We do discuss others in our brief,, but the fourth point
in the statute I would emphasize is Section 402(a){19)(f)»
which we discuss at length in our brief and I won’t review that
in detail here.

That does constitute a specific Congressional

recognition of a relative home as a foster family heme,
QUESTION:

Probably not relevant, but suppose a child

was placed in one of the institutions, and the institution was
run by the grandmother of the child.

How would that enter

into it* as distinguished from a private home of the grand mother?

It is an institution where they've got 40 or 50

children, or 150, but happens to be run by the grandmother
of the particular child,
MR, LEHRER:

Well, the state is given authority,

under its licensing standards, to approve certain classifica­
tions of individuals as suitable caretakers or not.

And this

— You are precisely right, Mr, Chief Justice Burger -- is
precisely not the question presented in this case,

A state

28

might decide that, for purposes of institutional care, it
might not be appropriate to have a grandmother or any relative
care for that child in that setting because she might show
favoritism, maybe against the child or maybe for the child.
The question is not presented in this case about whether a
state might deem relatives to be not suitable caretakers.
Illinois does deem relatives to be suitable caretakers.
I hops that has answered the question.
But Section 402(a)(19)(f), which we discussed at
length in our brief, refers specifically to continuing either
protective payment or foster care payment to a child in the
home -*•- in a home of a relative who refuses to cooperate In
the WIN program, didn't mean to suggest, in the brief, that
the state might not make other alternative dispositions with
respect to a child in the home of a noncooperafclng relative,
but the provision does limit the state's remedial action to
a dependent child to either continuing foster care in the home
of a relative or if it is going to continue on AFDC outside
the home, limiting it to foster care.

Which must mean that

it must be continued in any home in which the child is placed.
And that does constitute a specific Congressional recognition
of a relative home as a foster family home.
Finally, HEW's administrative interpretation of the
statute unequivocally supports the conclusion that the chil­
dren here are eligible for federal foster care benefits.

29
We have not emphasized it here because it emphasizes itself.
It is the interpretation by an agency which is charged with
enforcing the foster car® statute and* indeed, was >-■» At leasts
cooperated In proposing and establishing the foster care
program In the first instance.

Moreover, this interpretation

has been a matter of public record, prominently so, for over
four years.
QUESTION:

How many years elapsed between enactment

of the statute and the promulgation of the regulations?
MR. LEHRER:

Fourteen years.

And I think the reason

why there was a lapse, why there was not an articulated policy
prior to 197^* though the Solicitor notes the operative policy
was,in fact, in effect

prior to ‘74 — The reason why that

is, supports again the conclusion that the children here are
eligible is precisely because the fact of whether children
were placed in relative homes or nonrelative homes is really
irrelevant to the foster care program in the sense that the
states are given the placement authority.

The Congress In

the foster care statute delegates to the states the right to
make that placement which it deems to be in the best Interest
of the child.
So, the Federal Government wasn't reviewing these
individual placement decisions.

This is not like the ordinary

situation which sometimes comes up In AFGC cases where in the
state plan, one must specify your not providing benefits to

30

children, let's say, bet ween 18 and 21«

There is no necessity

or need for the state to make that specification, so there
would have been no HEW review of those kinds of decisions.
And it only cane to light, I think, following two District
Court decisions

Federal District Court decisions in early

1971 which brought this fact that a few states were not con­
sidering children placed in related care -to be eligible.

And,

at that point, HEW very promptly Issued an instruction mandating
hat the proper interpretation of the Act in its own regula»
felons was.
In conclusion, Section 408, in common sense -common sense In terms of what Congress must have intended in
the light of the primary purposes of the AFDC programf and in
light of the traditional suitability of relative care in our
society, which the state policy here frustrates and deters
the statute itself, in common sense» points decisively toward
that reading of Section 408, making the children here eligible
for foster care and decisively against the conclurion that
Congress meant to discourage the care of neglected or abused
children by their relatives and deny them the higher benefits
and specialized social services which were necessary to
remedy the abuse and neglect to which they had been subject.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
says that that read-ing of the statute, making the children
here eligible, is the correct reading.

It is the correct

^

31

reading.

And It is for that reading that the Court of

Appeals' decision should be affirmed.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further., Mr, Bargiel?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J, BARGIEL* ESQ, *
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, BARGIEL:

I would like to make one brief

comment in rebuttal,
I would simply like to reaffirm that our position
that unrelated persons are not eligible for foster care is
based upon the plain meaning of the language employed by
Congress in the statute,
Eligibility is defined in terms of a dependent
child or families with dependent children* not in terms of
foster care.

Foster care is the thing that a dependent child

or an eligible family are eligible for.

And that's the thing

that the Plaintiffs overlook.
I would like to point out* if I may* one thing that
the Plaintiff's reading of this statute could result in*
which Congress obviously never intended,

■ * :

v.

Section 606* which provides a specification of
certain relatives* includes as a relative* a specified rela­
tive* a mother or a father,

That is* a child can be living

with his mother or father* or certain other relatives* and be

32
eligible for basic APDC assistance»

If a brother or a sister

can be a foster parent* under Section 4o8* then there is no
reason that a mother or a father cannot be a foster parent»
If they otherwise meet the eligibility criteria* because they
are also one of the specified relatives contained in Section

606* which Section 608 is written notwithstanding or in spite
Of 0
So* 1 would suggest to the Court that the Plaintiff's
construction of this statute would result in at least that
foolish result.

And I would again respectfully request that

the Court reverse the determination of the 7th Circuit Court
of Appeals,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon* at 2:40 o'clock* p»m„* the case was
submitted.)
