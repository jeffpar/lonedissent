MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

now in the pending case,
Mr, Walters, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSE W . WALTERS, ESQ., (RESUMED)
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WALTERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I believe that when we recessed on yesterday after­
noon X was discussing with the Court the Sheffield case that
arose in Sheffield, Alabama.

I believe that I had just ad­

vised the Court that a three-judge district court had unani­
mously ruled that the City of Sheffield did not fall within
the definition of a political subdivision as defined in the
Voting Rights Act.
This Court in a split decision reversed the District
Court and as I read and understand the majority opinion this
Court is holding, in effect, that any political entity that
has power over some aspects, or any aspect of the electoral
processes within a designated jurisdiction is covered by the
Acta

Now, X really don't know that X have any real basic
quarrel with the decision of this Court, but X do say that it
eccmes necessary to review the Dougherty County Board of
Education under the decision in Sheffield and inquire as to

14

whether or not the Dougherty County Board of Education doss,
in fact, have any power over any aspect of the electoral'
process in Dougherty County. Georgia.
It is submitted that the answer to this inquiry is
in the negative.
There are many political subdivisions in the State
of Georgia that have no control, no power, nothing to do with
the electoral', processes.

And we say that the. Dougherty

County Board of Education is one of these.

Others would be

hospital authorities, payroll development authorities, county
boards of health and the like, none of whom have any function
whatsoever in connection with the political processes.
In the absence of control of power over the
electoral process, neither the Dougherty County Board of
Education or any other entity which has no responsibility or
control respecting elections is, we submit, required to seek
the approval of Federal authorities oh a purely and simply
personnel matter.
QUESTION:

What if the State legislature passed a

law that said that all employers must give an hour off for
elections?

Would that have to be submitted?
MR, WALTER.»:

Yes, sir, because the State has the

power over the electoral process.
QUESTION:

what if the legislature delegated the

decision with,respect to that to a school board?

15
MR, WALTERS :

t would say, M.r0 «Justice White, that

if the Legislature delegated that decision to the beard, then
the board would have power over the electoral process.
QUESTION: What if there was no state law about it,
but an individual school board did pass a rule limiting or
some way bearing on how much time people get off to go to the
polls.»

and it was challenged and the state court said the

school board has that power under state law?
MR. WALTERS:

If the state law gave to the school

board such power over the electoral process, under the
Sheffield decision, I would say that the board would be a
public .subdivision.
QUESTION:

Is there much different impact if the

board then, within its powers, passed a resolution that said
that any teacher who declares himself for public office must
resign?
MR, WALTER!:
Simply and concisely.

Yes, I think it is, Mr. Justice White,
Maybe such school official or school

employee would have some other course, of action, but 2 do
not believe so, under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, because
-*■ I go back to the question that I clo not believe under the
laws of the State -•*
QUESTION:

You may be quite right.

Even so, it is

hard to deny that the board's rule would have an impact on
who is going to run for office and who isn *fc.

16
MRo WALTEK3:

Well, of course, Mr. Justice White,

in response to that -QUESTION:

Maybe that isn't a test under Section 5,

but it does have the impact.
MR. V!ALTERS:

I would have to say that I know of

no guaranteed federal right or state right that says a man
is entitled to a position with a board of education.
QUESTION:

What if the state legislature passed this

same rule, saying no public employee may run for office?
MR, WALTERS:

I would say that the state, being a

covered subdivision under the Act and specifically under
Section 4(b) of the-Act and under the Attorney General's
designation of the State of Georgia as being covered by the
Act —
QUESTION:

What if the legislature delegated that

power to the school board, but said, "In the case of school
boards, vie will leave it up to individual school boards"?
MR. WALTER! :

I think if the State of Georgia did

that and delegated that power to the school boards, then the
school board would be exercising control over some part of
the electoral process.
QUESTION:

Suppose the legislature doesn't pass such

a law but it is determined by a court that the school board
does have that power under state law?
MR. WALTERS :

Well, of course, Mr.-Justice White, I

think in response to that inquiry that the question would
arise as to whether or not under the lavas of the State of
Georgia --- and frankly and truthfully I do not believe that
there is any law in the State of Georgia that gives to the
Dougherty County Board of Education or any other board of
education any control over -QUESTION:

What if it is determined by a state

court that the board has that power?
MR. WALTERS:

X would certainly say, in response

to that, that it may be but this suit -QUESTION:

How can we decide the case?, If they

have the power under state law, would you' concede that it is
covered by Section 5?
MR. WALTERS:

If the board of education was charged

under the state law' with the responsibility of having some
control or power over the electoral process, then I would have
to say, under the decision in Sheffield, even though they may
not register voters, that they would be a covered subdivision.
Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr«Walters, is there any question at all

that your clinet had the power to adopt the rule that it did
adopt in this case?
MR. WAi/TERi:
QUESTION:

Not in my opinion.

Mo, sir.

Then doesn’t the real issue become

whether or. not the rule that was adopted is a standard

13
practice or procedure with respect to voting?
MR. WALTERS:

I would differ with you,

No, sir.

with all due respect, Your Honor.

I do not believe that

Rule 58 is anything other than a personnel rule.
QUESTION:

Well, then, isn't the issue whether or

not it is a standard practice or procedure with respect to
voting?
MR. WALTERS:
QUESTION:

Mo, sir, because —

Excuse me, Counsel,

Bo you mean your

negative answer to the question or to the merits of the
question?
MR. WALTERS:

I think I mean it to the merits of

the question, Mr. Chief Justice.
If an employee of the board of education went to
register for elective office of the House of Representatives,
he would not be asked the question, "Are you getting a leave
of absence from the board of education?"
asked anything.

He would not be

He would automatically be qualified and

would be permitted to run.
Now, the question then arises — may it please
Your Honor — as to whether or not after he does this,
after he says, "I am running,

I am offering for the office

of Georgia House of Representatives," than as to whether the
board of education, who has contracted with this man for
his services for a twelve-month period, has the right to

19
demand that this person fulfill his. contract which he has
previously entered into.

And we submit that this has

absolutely nothing to do with voting.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the real issue, since you

concede that the school board had power under state law to
adopt the rule it did adopt?
MR, WALTERS:

Yes, Your Honor*

certainly if the

issue as to whether or-not- the. rule is a standard practice or
procedure.
QUESTION:

But you have already also conceded that

if the state legislature adopted the same rule it is a
standard and covered by t; action 5.
MR, WALTER*:

Yes, because a state legislature could

say before, "Do you qualify for office?
QUESTION:

I asked you if a state legislature said

that no public employee may run for office.

I thought you

conceded that that would be covered by Section 5, because it
was a standard.
MR, WALTER*:

Yes., I think so, because, as I said,

the State of Georgia is specifically designated under Section
4(b) of the Act, and by the Attorney General.
QUESTION:

The state doss have control of the

electoral process,
MR. WALTER* :

It does have absolute'. '• control in

Georgia over the elections*

The Dougherty County Board of

20

Education cannot enact any regulation
QUESTION:

It did adopt this rule.

MR* WALTERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, but we -~

And there was no question of its power

to do so.
\

MR, WALTERS:

Mo, sir, I do not believe there is

any question of its power to adopt reasonable rules and
regulations pertaining to its employees,

I do not believe

there is any,
QUESTION:

What if the oiate of Georgia or

Dougherty County adopted a rule saying that no person who
is physically absent from his place of potential employment
as a county employee or stata employee shall be paid his
wages,

and that was applied to someone who ran for the

United States Senate from Georgia?
MR, WALTERs:

I would not construe that as being

a voting' rule.
QUESTION:

That is simply saying you have got to be

there and perform your services.
MR. WA LTEPE :
QUESTION:

Yes, sir*

And wouldn’t you agree that whether that

was adopted as a rule of the' school board or adopted as a
law by the state legislature the test would be the same?
MR, WALTERS:

I would not, Your Honor, because,

again,. X have to go back to the fact that I concede that the

21

ii feat e of Georgia does have control over their electoral
processes,
QUESTION:

Certainly, but the question would be

that it's legislating of a rule such as was described by
my brother, Rehnquiat, would be the legislation of a standard
practice or procedure with respect to voting.
MR. WALTERS:
Rehnquist’s inquiry

,

Mo, sira If I understood Mr. Justice
it would not be a rule pertaining to a

standard practice, but it would be a rule pertaining to
whether or not that man was paid ~~
QUESTION:

That's what Justice Stewart is asking you.

Would such a rule be a standard practice?
MR. WALTERS:
QUESTION:

No, sir, not in my judgment.

Then it would not be covered by Section

5 whether it was passed by the state legislature or the
school board.
In any event, that would be the question; wouldn't
it?
MR. WALTRRS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Walters, do you see any difference

between a law or rule which says that any officer who doesn't
work won’t be paid and a rule that says any county officer
who doesn't v?ork because of elections won’t be paid?’

They

are two different animals, aren't they?
MR, WALTER* :

No, sir, Mr, Justice Marshall, I —

22
QUESTION:

Why do you need an additional rule to

limit to his working for election?

Why don't you just pass

a rule which says if he doesn't do his work he doesn't get
pa id ?
MR. WALTER!:

I think that this would have been.

Mr. Justice Marshall, an answer to this without litigation.
I think that the board of education would have been properly
within its powers and authorities -QUESTION:

You said it Is now within its authority.

MR, WALTERS:

Yes, but I say I think they would

have been properly within their powers if Mr, White, upon
election and not serving in any job for which he had con­
tracted. to have terminated his employment without any rule,
without any regulation.

But the board, I think, chose to

deal with this matter in a more reasonable and moderate
fashion, and they prescribe, simply and concisely, how a
man could enter the political arena and continue in his
employment with the board of education-.
QUESTION:

Under the present rules, is there any­

thing to prevent a person in this man's position from working
for a liquor store?
MR, WALTERS:

Is there anything to prevent him from

working for a liquor store?
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, or doing anything else.,

MR. WALTERS:

There is certainly nothing in the rule

23

that would prevent him -~
QUESTION:

The only prevention is if he worked for

election?
MR. WALTERS:

Well, if I may, Mi-. Justice Marshall,

I think if the board, when they contract with an employee,
are entitled to expect his full attention and full time to
the duties he has contracted to perform ~~
QUESTION:

Are you saying that's an implied con­

dition of his contract?
MR, WALTERS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I am, Mr, Chief Justice,

Well, you don't need the rule.

MR* WALTERS:

This may be true, but I think we read

the rule so that it would spell out to any employee then or
in the future ~~
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't be covered by Section

5 if it wasn't a change, but I didn't know you were con­
tending that it wasn't a change.
MR. WALTERS: -Yes, sir, I am contending it was not
a change.
QUESTION:

The legal decision below is against you

on that.
. MR. WALTERS:

Yes, I think the legal decision in the

three-judge court
QUESTION:
this was a change

With respect to what Georgia law is, thafc

24

MR. WALTERS:

I asked this question.myself, "What

modification and what change?"
Now, the lower court decision says —> and If 1 may
quote:

"By imposing a financial loss on its employees who

choose to become candidates, it makes it more difficult for
them to participate in the democratic process and consequently
restricts the field from which the voters may select their
representatives."
Now. this, I think, is the holding of the lower
court.

And this is what they say is the modification.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walters, may 1 interrupt you.

Mr. White, as I understand it, was Assistant
Coordinator of Student Personnel Services.
MR. WALTERS:
QUESTION:

Correct, sir.

What were his duties?

MR. WALTERS:

His duties were counseling of

students, selecting, maybe, their curriculum -- physically
counseling, as I understand it, Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION:

The board had a coordinator and

Mr. White was an assistant.

How many other assistants were

there?
MR. WALTER»:):

X do not know, Mr. Justice Powell.

It could be determined right fast, I believe.

I have the

Superintendent of the Board
QUESTION:

It is not essential either way.

25
MR, WALTERS:

I do not know how many others there

were.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel, we have ques­

We have enlarged your time five

minutes and have enlarged your friend's time five minutes.
You may reserve it, if you wish, for rebuttal.
MR. WALTERS:

I would like to.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. MYER. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. MYER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The statement of facts as presented by Counsel for
Appellant is correct insofar as it goes.

I would, however,

like to add certain additional facts that I think are rele­
vant to the Court's inquiry.
First is that in May of 1972 when Appellee John
White announced intention to run he was the first black can­
didate, at least in living memory and perhaps since Recon­
struction Era time, to run for the State General Assembly.
QUESTION:

Does this make a difference?

Does race

make a difference in this case?
MR„ MYER:

It makes a difference not in this case

but it does, we think, in terms of the substantive section 5

26
question which,if this had been submitted, is the inquiry of
the Attorney General or the District Court of the District
of Columbia*

And we are suggesting this as well as certain

other circumstances surrounding the adoption of the rule
because it is apparent that there is a potential in this
C3 S S *

QUESTION:

Suppose there were no such circumstances,

would this Rule 58 have to’be precleared?
MR. MYER:

Yes, Your Honor, it would.

QUESTION:

Why are you arguing the surrounding

circ urns tane es ?
MR. MYER:

Because this simply is an illustration,

I think, Your Honor, of the kind of change that can be made
in a circumstance which raises some suspicion, without de­
termining whether or not in fact it violates Section 5
standards of purpose or effectj but rather in the concept of
this case I think it is relevant that immediately upon an­
nouncing the rule was adopted.
QUESTION:

If the only people who had ever announced

they wished to run had been white would it make any difference?
MR * MYER:

Mr. White was also, so far as any records

show -- and the record is clear that he is the first also
ever to announce to run.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

difference case to you,

I was putting a

27

MR, MYER;

But the issue before the court below is

not the substantive determination.

It is a question of

whether or not Rule 58 is a covered change under Section 5>
and b) as the second Question in the jurisdictional statement,
whether or not the Dougherty County Board of Education is sr
covered entity.
QUESTION:

A?*d you are saying that discriminatory

intent or effect is immaterial for Section 5 -*•
MR, MYER:
correct.

For Section 5 coverage questions, that9a

/ 1though that is the nature of the inquiry which

would be made upon submission to the Attorney General.
QUESTION:

Did you consider bringing the 1983 suit

rather than proceeding this way?
MR,MYER:

Your Honor, the complaint is filed in

five counts and there is a 1983 count, there is a Fourteenth
Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection count as well as
a Fifteenth Amendment count.

The case was disposed of on

cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the Section 5
issue.

And, that having been resolved in favor of the

Plaintiff, it rendered it unnecessary then to reach the other
counts in the complaint.
QUESTION:

What if the Ford Motor Company had a plant

in Albany, Georgia, and the first time a black employee sought
to run for political office it adopted exactly the same rule
that the Dougherty County Beard of Education had adopted?

28
Your argument as to the potential for abuse would
be just as good there as in the case of the Dougherty County
Board of Education, wouldn't, it?
MR. MYER:

The only difference there. Your Honor,

is that as a private employer they are clearly not covered by
Section 5, that is, the Voting Rights Act only extends to
those designated jurisdictions and, as this Court has clari­
fied in Sheffield, state actors

within that designated"-

jurisdiction, whether it is a state or a political sub­
division —
QUESTION:

Potential for discrimination really isn’t

any part of the statutory test, is it?
MR. MYER:

I believe it is, but it is only applicabis

to state actors, not the private sector of the country.
QUESTION:

As a matter of statutory coverage.

MR. MYER:

As a matter of what Congress intended

when it adopted the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
QUEST I uN:

So, you feel that it isn't enough that

it be a standard plan or practice,

it has to have a poten­

tial for discrimination.
MR. MYER:

The question is: What is a standard

practice or procedure?

, That is the substantive determina­

tion that the Attorney General makes once it is submitted;
that is, whether it has the potential -QUESTION:

But in deciding whether it is to be

29
submitted or not, is there any inquiry or not?
MR. MY3SR:

No.

The answer is no.

QUESTION:

Is it your submission that any kind of an

official rule that has some kind of an impact on an election,
or is it just any standard or practice?

I can see why it

would be a qualification for candidacy, or something, but
this wasn’t qualification for candidacy.
MR. MYER:

This was qualification for candidacy

insofar as public employees of Dougherty County Board of
Education — in that it imposed a very substantial financial
ba rrier.
QUESTION:

I know, but there wasn't any disqualifi­

cation from running imposed on them.
MR. MYER:

That's correct.

There was a disincentive

for running, just as, for example., in Whitley there were dis­
incentives and there were increased barriers to qualifying as
an independent candidate.
QUESTION:

But if a school teacher went over and

filed as a candidate, they wouldn't reject his papers because
he was employed by the board.
MR, MYrR:

That’s correct.

And indeed the school

board's policy -»
QUESTION:

The school board might fire him, but I

-don't know,
MR, MYER:

No, in fact, under the school board's

30
policy, they wouldn’t fire him.

They would arrange for him

to take a leave, even though during the time he was running
he was ready, able and willing to perform his contractual
duties.
QUESTION:

It is not unknown in political life that

people who leave their employment to campaign for public
office have an arrangement with their campaign committee that
their living costs or regular salary is supplanted by their
supporters.

Suppose the record in this case or any case

would show that the campaign committee had provided a sub­
stitute for the salary.
case.

Suppose that were shown in this

Would you be here?
MR. MYfCR:

Yes, sir, because I think that is an

irrelevant factor insofar as —
QUESTION:

He should get two salaries then?

He

should get the salary from his committee and the salary
from the public also?
MR. MYER:

Well, he should get the salary so long

as he is certainly performing his duties.

And that, for

example, suggests, I think, the question Mr. Justice Marshall
asked of Mr. Walters, that is, if instead of an electoral
context we have a liquor business that he was operating on
the side, he could obviously have two incomes.

But I think

the question of whether or not he would receive some supple­
mental in a particular case is not a relevant factor —

31
QUESTION:

But the question isn't whether he gets

paid for no services, he wanted to perform the services and
get paid for them.
MR. MYER:

That is correct, and was ready, willing

and able to do so ~~
QUESTION:

Mr. Myer, you are addressing yourself

now, I gather, to the first question presented, i. e.,
whether this rule is a, quote, “standard pract5.ce or
procedure with respect to voting,1,1 unquote, not with respect
to the second issue.
MR, I-iYiSR:

That is correct.,

V' • ...r

QUESTION:. And that's the only issue to which you
are addressing yourself?
MR, MYER:

That is correct, exactly.

QUESTION:

Mr. Myer, we are not giving you very much

chance to argue your own case.

I will ask you one more ques­

tion and then try to keep quiet.
This goes back to sometlhing that your adversary was
asked.

Let's assume that the Legislature of Georgia enacted

a statute of general application to all state employees and
all employees of local subdivisions of the'state that said,
in substance, that while any such employee could run for state
or local office, that if one did and wished jto receive com­
pensation during that period, he would have to work at least
half time,

Would that require preclearance?

32
MR. MYER:
thetical.

Lst me make sure X understand the hypo­

It is a state statute that says, "During the time

you are campaigning* in order to receive pay you must be
willing to work half time,"
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MYKR:

I think* clearly, that that is a change

in the election law insofar as it sets forth standards,
practices or procedures with respect to campaigning and
offering for candidacy
QUESTION:

May I ask you a second question.

MR. MYER:

~~ And as this Court has defined the

voting language within Section 5, that encompasses candidacy.
QUESTION:

May I ask you another question to follow

up on that one, without violating my suggestion I wouldn't
ask you too many.
Let's assume the Attorney General in those circum­
stances decided not to preclear.

In other words, he said,

"Georgia, you must go ahead and pay these people whether they
work at all."

That means the public would have to pay for

people who run for office, regardless of whether they performed
any services.

Do you think the Congress of the United

dtates intended any such result?
MR. MYER:
Congress intended

Well, Mr. Justice Powell, I think that
and certainly if there were any question

in the ‘65 Act the ratification of this Court's decision in

33
Allen and the companion cases in both 3.970 and 1975 make it
abundantly c1ear that it is Congress* intention that this
Act should apply in the most minor way.

And 1 think that

where there is any alteration, as this Court has said, that
has to be submitted.
Now, the Court has posed the question of vrhether or
not, if the Attorney General objected so that that state
statute could not go into effect, Congress intended it.

1

think Congress intended for that kind of scrutiny and has
provided not only an expedited consideration, under the 60~
day provision of the submission to the Attorney General, but

where there is an objection the State of Georgia could then
come into the District Court of the District of Columbia and
raise that issue as to whether or not that’s a violation or
the substantive standards, as there have been a number of
cases such as Beer in this Court.
QUESTION:

How many people are affected by this

rule, Mr, Myer?
MR. MYER:

Your Honor, the record does not contain

what the racial composition of Dougherty County Board of
Education is.

If. for example, however, and we do have

census information in the brief that show that in excess of
53% of those listed in the 1970 census were black.
Q'O'itoiTIQN:

X am talking about those who work for

the board and are affected by this rule., not the voting

34
population.
MR. MYSR:

That I do not know.

QUESTION*.

Is it likely that a majority of them are

MR. MY lift:

It is likely.

QUESTION:

Very likely, isn't it?

MR, MYfiR:

Correct.

QUESTION:

Well* then the rule has a greater impact

whites?

on whites than on anyone else.
MR, MYER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,, that may be

true, except that, I would submit, the philosophy behind the
kind of remedy that Section 5 represents was not to focus on
the discrimination issue alone.

That is, if there was a

standard practice or procedure in effect in June of 1964
that is patently discriminatory, it escapes Section 5 inquiry.
And if subsequent to the effective date of the Act any covered
entity makes any change — no matter how ameliorative or how
discriminatory — that change should be submitted.

And that

was based upon 100 years of Congress trying to deal with
voting rights discrimination, starting with Section 5 of the
1870 Voting Rights Act, continuing in the 1957 Act, continuing;
in the i960 Act and included in the 1964 —
QUESTION:
thetical.

Mr. Myer, I want to take another hypo­

If Georgia passed — and we now assume that most

state employees are white in Georgia, for the purpose of this

35
question — and the Legislature passed an act saying that
no state employee can run for office.

Wouldn’t that have to

be cleared?
MR. MYER:

It would, Your Honor, if it represents

a change -~
QUESTION:

Is there any question?

MR* MYER:

There is no question in my view if it

represents a change from what was in effect November 1, 1964.
QUESTION:

And then its impact would be a matter

for the Attorney General to determine.
MR. MYER:

Under the substantive inquiry —

QUESTION:

Under the substantive inquiry that he

MR. MYER:

That's correct.

makes.

And to return to the hypothetical that Mr. Justice
White was posing to Counsel for Appellant. I think there is
no question that if the Georgia General Assembly adopted Rule
58, but simply made it applicable to every employee, or even
every board of education employee, and in fact made it a part
of the electoral statute of the Etate of Georgia, Title 34,
that would have to be submitted.
Given that, and given this Court's decision in
Sheffield ~~ and I think this case demonstrates the soundness
of that analysis -- you have a delegated.power.

Under Georgia

Code 32-10113 the local boards of education are granted the

36
authority to conduct their affaires.

And they have done, on a

localized basis, what clearly if the state did on a state­
wide basis, would be submitted,
QUESTION:

Mr. Myer, can I ask you a question?

You’ve got two issues, the standard or practice
issue and whether this unit is covered.

I would like, to

direct your attention to the coverage of the school board.
Now, supposing, instead of the school board action you had,
say, the social science department of the high school thought
It would be desirable to have some teachers in the legislature

of segregation in Albany and Dougherty County, and stated
that like most and many cities in the South segregation has

The Attorney General

Wilkes County, Georgia, both entities have filed

lawsuits in the District Court of the District of Columbia
and engaged in a trial and there was a suit in adverse,and
they are then bringing the case here.

The 197° census shows

that Wilkes County, Georgia, has a population of 8,000
people.

They have clearly made the determination and clearly

have the resources to bring that action.

Just as, in this

So that,
And, indeed®

the number of cases brought in the District of Columbia, I
am sure, is relatively small.

Just as, for example, the

enforce the Voting Rights Act.

on the courts has, at least empiraclly, not been shown.

And

I am sure that at some point, if Congress were to be con­

vinced of that,as they will have the opportunity in 1982,
that alteration can be mode.
One additional argument X would like to submit is

42

that this kind of change — and in terms of where is the line
drawn — 1 think that Congress In enacting Section 5 con­
templated or was trying to deal with all sorts of changes.
And, therefore, it was the intent, in fact, by the submission
process not to say specifically and not to be able to define
specifically every conceivable change.

country had found to corne up with new devices to delay de­
segregation ,
do that, whatever — and there are all kinds of
hypothetical» that can be submitted — the standard and line
to draw in this case is, X think, very clear.

And that line

is where there is a rule or change which directly addresses
the electoral system, as this does, then that clearly —
whatever the other kinds of potential bypothetlcals and
potential factual situations would arise -- but that clearly
is covered.

And that insofar as this case is concerned that

provides the kind of standard or rule to set in this case,
that is where the action directly addresses the electoral
process, then at least, although that's not the final line,
that's as far as this Court needs to go.

My final argument is that I think,under this Court's

standard practice or procedure — that I think the Court's

44
decisions in Vi hit ley, and subsequently Hadnott v, Amos show
very clearly that where there is a change concerning qualifi­
cation and increased barriers to candidacy, those kinds of
changes are contemplated.
QUESTION:

Do you think this is about as far as

Section 5 has been stretched in the sense that you are
frankly saying .just any substantial impact on the possibility
of somebody running for an office is covered?

There aren't

any other cases just like this, are there?
MR. MYfiR:

This is the first case coming up like

this, at least to my knowledge.

But Section 5« Mr. Justice

White, does not look at the degree of control.

That is, if

you begin to talk about control ~~ moving a polling place
25 feet is not a major impact.

I know, but you could read Section 5

as saying that we are really dealing with laws that are
intended to deal directly with the electoral process, the
voting or the electoral process.

you can have an hour off," why should that be covered?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wallace,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE* ESQ..
AMICUS CURIAE
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The key to this case, In our view* is to be found
in this Court's statement five years ago in Georgia v. United
states* that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is not concerned with a simple inventory of voting procedures* but
rather with the reality of change practices as they affect
the Negro voter.
The problem in this case came to our attention as
a result of the complaint filed on behalf of Mr. White.

We

took a look at it* and there is a stipulation in this .record

48
that as a result of the adoption of Rule 58 Mr. White was
required to take a leave of absence of approximately three
months time without pay in 1972# of approximately five months
in 1974 and approximately three months in 1976°

It wap only

in 1974 that he was involved in contested general election
campaign as well as the primary campaign.. And in the printed
Appendix on page 24A, at the bottom of the page, there is
listed in his affidavit the sums of money that he lost in
compensation as a result of the application of this rule to
him.
QUJ&bTIQM:

Mr, Wallace, what if the school board had

had this rule in 1985 and then abolished it, so that it made
it easier for candidates to run?

Under your co-counsel's

submission* it nonetheless would have had to have been sub­
mitted to the Justice department.
MR, WALJjACjE:

Of course.

The result might be

different, but the question ie whether it is a rule covered
by Section 5«
QUJiiTXON:

00

it really doesn't make much difference

whether it deters someone or encourages him.
MR. WALiACii:

What makes a difference, as we view

the purpose of Section 5, as explained by the Court in the
quotation that I started my argument with ~~ what makes the
difference is the potential impact on the reality of affecting
voting rights and we have to look to see what is involved here

49
and compara it with the experiences that we have had under
Section 5* which is what X am attempting to do here for the
benefit of the Court.
As we 'look at the figures at the bottom of page 24A,
v;a see* first of all* that these figures suggest that Mr .White
is probably not a very affluent individual, since three months
of salary in 1972 amounted to $2310, and so forth.

The second

thing we notice is that these are rather substantial sums to
have to be forfeiting in order to be able to run for office
in comparison with the closest analogy that we have bsen
dealing with under the Voting Rights Act, in our experience,
and that is changes in the sine of filing fee.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, suppose he had been the

richest man in the county,

What difference would it have

mad e ?
MRo WALLAC.E:
QUESTION:

We are looking at potential impact.

But if this case is decided in accordance

with the position of the Department, the hypothetical that
have been asked and answered here today would have to follow
this precedent, without record to who was rich and who was
poor and what the consequences.were.
MR. WALLACE:

Of course*

X am merely trying to

follow this Court's admonition in Georgia v, United states,
that the Act is to be determined with regard to the realities
of changes in voting rights as they affect Negro voters and

50
candidates.
QUESTION:

So we view each cane* then, on its facts

to determine what the reality —
MR, WALLACE:

We are trying to determine whether

this Is a change that is covered.

And in order to determine

whether it is a change that is covered, we first look to see
what kind of a change it is and compare it with other changes
that we know are within the coverage of the Act that we have
been dealing with.

And increases in filing fees were singled

out for mention in the 1975 Committee reports in both the
House and the senate as examples of changes for which the
Attorney General has properly interposed objections under the
f

Voting Rights Act which Congress was extending.
QUiLTIuN:

I think really the problem in the argu­

ment you are making -- You are going to the merits of the
question that the Attorney General would be required to
decide were this submitted to him; because, as my brother,
Rehnqulst, has indicated, the repeal of such a rule as this
would be, under you.r submission, a standard practice or
procedure with respect to voting.
MR. WALLACE:

I am not attempting to argue the

merits.
QUESTION:
l

And that's the issue before us — not the

merits.
MR. WALLACE:

I understand.

I am not attempting to

51
argue the

merits, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

I am merely trying —

Whether it has an affect on Negro voters

is a matter for the Attorney General to decide, if this Is
required to be submitted to him under this statute.
MR. WALLACE;
QUESTION:

That is right.

But we are concerned with that question,

not the merits of this.
MR. WALLACE;

That is correct, and the statute

applies to changes as they, in reality, affect opportunities
to exercise voting rights and to run for office.

We looked

at Department of Justice records with respect to increases
in filing fees shortly before — the fact that we had to
interpose objections to some of them was approved by both
i

■

committees of Congress as proper administration of the Voting
Rights Act to see what kind of changes, what kinds of finan­
cial burden had required us, in our view, to interpose
objection because of the burdens that they placed on the
ability of individuals to run for office.
And what we saw, as a few examples, in 1973$ is that
we saw fit to interpose an objection to an increase in
usilia, Georgia, of the filing fee to run for mayor from
$10 to $125, and., to run for the council from $10 to $100.
We had similar examples. -~
QUESTION;

Wouldn’t the reduction in the filing fee

come equally within —

52

MR. WALLACE:

Of course, but the point is the

questions from the bench have suggested that this case
threatens to deflect us Into trivia; but we are talking about
a .case in which, on its face, on the allegations of the
complaint, a burden of several thousand dollars has been
.imposed on the ability of a candidate to run for office,
where we have been required to review burdens of less, than
$100 that have been imposed in a change in filing fees.
It is true that this is not in form a filing fee,
but the economic impact on the face of it is very similar as
a disincentive to run for office.
found.

Somehow this money must be

He has to do without it, whether he has to pay it as

a filing fee or not.

If the Efcate Legislature were to adopt

a rule of local legislation that employees of the Dougherty
County Board of Education, in order to run for the State
Legislature, must pay a filing fee of $3*000, or must pay a
filing fee equivalent to three months salary, it would be
obvious that that would be a change covered by the Voting
Rights Act.
QUESTION:

Equally obvious if they only required

25 cents; wouldn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, but the point is that

Congress — the fundamental premise of the Voting Rights Act
is that Congress believed it could not anticipate the form
that new obstacles to voting rights and • to running for office

53
might take.

And. therefore, as the Court said in .Sheffield»

it shifted the advantages of time and inertia from the per­
petrators of discrimination to its victims.
QUH&TIQN:

If this rule had been in effect since

1890., let us say, there wouldn’t be any Section 5 case at all,
would there?
MR, WALLACE:

If the rule had been in effect?

Of

course not.
QUESTION:

He might have relief somewhere else, you

suggest, but he wouldn’t have any here.

That has to be done with all the other

important business of the Attorney General of the United

HR® WALLACE:

The Voting Rights Act Section of the

Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is staffed
to implement the policies reflected in this Act which has beer,
one of the most successful civil rights acts in history.

the fact that the percentage of objections interposed is
small doesn’t detract from the fact that the Act has resulted
in great changes in voting and candidacy in the covered juris­
dictions.

Where the objections are interposed, they often

amount to very important safeguardss whereas, as my cocounsel said, 100 years of trying to deal with these matters

And unless

the outer limits for the applicability of the Voting Rights
Act have been already reached.

And X say that the restrictions

imposed by the Voting Rights Act, on a lengthy number of
selected Southern States, are unique in the history of this
Nation,
One of the members of this Court has said that the
"preclearanee requirement' of the Act is. a substantial departure
from ordinary concepts of Federal systems.

than to this Court?
MR. WALTERS:

I certainly do not intend to make an

argument that is not properly before the Court.

I didn't imply that.

X just think they

are policy questions, aren't they, basically? Despite the
fact that Justices up here have made the utterances.
MR. WALTERS :

Well, I would say> Mr. Justice

Blackmun, that a commonsense approach to an act of Congress
and to a construction of an act of Congress is a significant
factor in a judicial determination of the intent of that
act.

And J would say that, after all is said and done, and

all the rhetoric is over, a commonsense look at Rule 58 will
reveal that it is not a standard practice or procedure with
respect to voting,as Congress intended.
