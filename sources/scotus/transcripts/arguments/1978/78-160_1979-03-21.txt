ON BEIIALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITIIs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

5

the Court:

This suit amounts to a suit to quiet title to

*«*?

/

about 2900 acres of land lying on the east bank of the

8

Missouri River, in Iowa, about 30 miles south of Sioux City.
The Plaintiffs are the Omaha Indian Tribe and the

United States, as trustee for the Tribe.

here.

They are respondents

The Defendants are the record title holders of the

12

13

land.

They are counter claimants.

14

a corporation in the State of Iowa, and they are the

15

Petitioners here.
I represent Mr. Wilson and others.

17

They are three individuals

Mr. Cullison

will speak for the State of Iowa,
Directly west of this area, across the river in

Nebraska, is the Omaha Indian Reservation.

21

boundary.

It should be east.

Shouldn't it?
It should be east.

Yes, on the back of the white Appendix

there is a drawing, a map of the area, which shows the present
river.

It shows the Iowa and Nebraska State boundary which

was fixed by compact between the States in 1943.

It shows the

retracement of the Barrett meander of the Nebraska shore of
this peninsula of 1867.

That is correct, Your Honor.
That will be most helpful.
Yes.

Actually, there are copies of the

same map in several other places in briefs and so forth, but
that’s the one I have referred to.
The irregular line there which is north, east and

12

south, of the retracement of the Barrety survey line is the

13

Iowa High Bank,

14

bounded on the west by the Iowa and Nebraska State boundary

Inside that Barrett survey retracement,

and on the other side by the retracement is what we call in
this case the Barrett survey area.

17

lowland area, so bounded on the west by the State boundary.

18

The other side by the Iowa high bank, which is Blackbird Bend.

19

The Plaintiffs in this case, the State — I mean the

20

United States as Trustee for the Tribe and the Omaha Tribe

claim that this land now on the Iowa bank of the River is

there by reason of the avulsive actions of the River, and that

MR, SMITH:

Yes, Iowa claims part of this land as

13

accretion to the east half of the bed of the River Iowa owned.

U

And the rest of it is claimed by Iowa and the other Defendants f

15

as accretion to Iowa riparian land.

16

Defendants claim through Iowa and Iowa claims through the otheif

The Court’s decision in that respect was further
influenced by its decision to apply Federal rather than State
common law of accretion and. avulsion and by its peculiar
version of State common law under which there may be an

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

That’s right.

Did I say State?

Yes.
I'm sorry.

Federal lav;, yes.

It's a

7

peculiar version of Federal lav; under which it is not

e

necessary in order to have an avulsion that there be any fast
rand severed from the bank of the river and becoming attached

•io

to the other, and that there may be an avulsion within the

j

n

neu or ehe river where the thalweg of the river moves over

j

or around a piece of shore or a sandbar.

13

necessary in order to have an avulsion that the river abandon |

And that it’s not

It all happens in the bed.

questions for review.

limited it to fc->"o of those questions.

Court of Appeals erred in so construing Section 194 to make it

difference was that the plural was used "Indians".

changed to singular in the 1834 Act.

18

the imagination "Indians" plural could be construed to in-

QUESTION:

Actually, in the 1822 enactment, in

22

Section 4, when you go back sto stafcutes-at-large, it's used

in the Plural in the first sentence, or first clause, and

24

the singular in the second clause.

25

MR. SMITH:

That's correct, Your Honor.

j

The opposition says that this change was a mere

2

change to correct syntax and make it the same in both places.

«.X

O

But, if they wanted to correct the syntax and make it mean

plural, they could just as veil have changed the later word

there from plural to singular, and chat would have had the

same effect.

rather than change the singular to plural.

Congress chose to change the plural to singular

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, is it your view that if a

husband and wife who are joint tenants of property Indian

10

would not have the benefit of the statute if they both brought

It

suit?

12

MR. SMITH:

Eo, that53 not my view, Your Honor. If

13

there is two individual Indians suing one white person, the

14

statute, on its face, would apply.

15

QUESTION:

What if there are three? How do we

16

distinguish between singular and plural then?

17

many? is that it?

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Each individual Indian—•
Ifm not saying you5re giving your case

7

away, but I just wonder if the singular is significant? rather

than the fact it refers to "Indians: rather than "Indian

fi

Tribes"?
MR. SMITHs

Well, as I say, I don’t think even in

the 1822 Act, I don't think that could properly be construed
to include a tribe, where the plural is used.

But, as I say,

if by any stretch of the imagination it could be, certainly

possible to construe it as a tribe.

i
QUESTION:

What if instead of a tribe suing, one

tribal member sued on behalf of the class of Indians who
belong to the tribe?
MR. SMITH;

How would you handle that?
Well, if it's a matter of the individual

right, why I would say one could sue for the class.

But here,

as I pointed out, this is not a suit brought for individual
Indians by the tribe, it's a suit brought by the tribe for
itself, and involving tribal land, not a lot of Indian lands,
And? certainly, "an Indian", as I said, it takes more than one
Indian to make a tribe.

13

In. 1834 » the Courts were holding that tribes could

14

sections of the 1834 Act demonstrates that Congress knew how

15

to describe non-Indians.

16

has construed "white person" to mean all non-Indians.

18

such expressions as "any person other than an Indian."

But

In Section 16 of the 1934 Act, the word ’’white

Court held in United States vs. Perryman, in 1880, that

22

"white person" does not mean all non-Indians, and it does

23

not include a Negro.

24

25

And, with respect to that section; this

The trial judge held that
Section 194 would not be applicable in this case because, in

i

14
\

order to trigger its application, the Indian must first make

z

a showing of pre-possession or ownership of the land involved.

3

And that if the Indian could show previous possession

4

or ownership, he would be showing an avulsion-, and if he made

5

that proof, he wouldn't have to have Section 194 because he

6

had already proved his case»

7

The trial judge held that this land was accretion

to the Iowa riparian land and, as such, that it was not the

same land that the Indian owned or possessed in 1867.

i

It was

the Court:

Mr. chief Justice, and. may it please

If there is anything clear throughout the history

of the Federal system is that the Tenth Amendment to the
Constitution and the decisions of this Court require applica­

putes, unless the constitutional laws of the United States
otherwise require.

This was the rule even under Swift, v.

Tyson.

22

It is the position of the State of Iowa that; these
basic principles 'have been violated in this case.

Until this

controversy arose in 1975, title was settled in the
Petitioners in this case.
In 1975, the Solicitor for the United Staten

23
Department of Interior formed the erroneous belief that the
24
land in this case was cut off from the Omaha Indian Reserva-

25
t.ion by a re -channelization project by the United States Corps

of Engineers .during the 1940’s.

Later in 1975, the Tribe, aided by the United States

that it is required because the case involves an interstate

This is a flat out case of a right claim by trespass.

to the State of Iowa.

We have put into this record ~~ we

have put into the record for this Court two deeds from these
Petitioners to the State of Iowa, and that's the only claim
of title that the State of Iowa has, is two deeds —— two
claim deeds deraigning back to a man named Joe Kirk, who in
trespassed upon these lands and says he acquired title

Well, Your Honor, my argument is very
I don't believe this case should go

off strictly on interpretation of

25 USC 194.

I think it

has to go on the broader elements of the treatments that
were presented here and the fact that we went, ahead and proved
that we were in possession; that we proved there were no
accretions and that the title would reside with us in the
circumstances.

statutory question since they do provide a backdrop for the

23
24
25

i would like to cover both the statutory

consideration of the choice of law question.
This morning's question raised one point that lsd
like to clear up immediately in terms of the application of
Section 194 to this case.

That is a threshhold question of

this the kind of case where the United States and the Trie:;
could have shown previous possession or ownership in order to

50
?

invoke the presumption of Section 194,

And a suggestion was

2

made, or the question was raised:

3

where the allegations are that the lands that the. United States,

4

and the Tribe are claiming was destroyed, does that mean that

5

the showing initially made were required in order to invoke

<5

the presumption is the same showing that’s required to pre­

7

vail in the case as a whole, and in that particular we have

8

not made out our initial burden of claiming the applicability

9

of the statutes.

We think not.

If it's the kind of case

We think that when the Tribe

10

and the United States showed that the land at these meets

n

and bounds under the sky, how ever one would want to describe

?2

it, property at that location was part of the Reservation

13

where legal title was held by the United States and the

14

beneficial ownership was in the Omaha Indian Tribe? that we

15

have shown previous possession or ownership as of 1867."

20

We have found one report from that period which

an intent not to include an Indian tribe here.

pretty clear from looking at that 1822 language that Congress

was not very careful and precise, in the same statute it

QUESTIONS

Mrs. Beale, following up on Jxnstd.ce

IS

Stevens' question, is there any precise date that can be

17

assigned to the time when the United States began to sue on

18

behalf of Indian wards for title to land?
MRS. BEALE:

19
20

There were some very early cases —

Ism thinking of one early one, but I think there arc romo

21

even earlier than that — I guess 1 cannot put a precise date

22

on that.

23
24
25

One thing I would mention in that connection though

is the suggestion that the Tribe could not be litigating in
1834 and that Congress was thinking of who would be coming

:

into Court in 1834 and thinking that individual Indians could

!

57
1

and that tribes couldn't.

2

would back up that suggestion

3

excuse me, the Cohen Handbook suggests to the contrary that

4

although Indian tribes were not considered to be a foreign

5

nation in that sense for jurisdictional purposes, they will

6

come into court.

7

in 1834 there was a case where the United States came in,

8

but there were some very early ones in the 1800!s.

9

don’t know of any suggestion that they couldn’t have come in

I would like to turn, unless there are any more

12

questions about the "an Indian” part of the statute, to the

14

start from the presumption or from the beginning point that

IS

Congress had again a broad protective purpose.

16

when it used the term "white person” it was not thinking

17

solely of individual Caucasians, and we think that in order

18

to give the protective purposes of the statute their full

19

it's not, although it has a sizable number of Indian citizens,

5

that it’s by no means predominantly or the majority of

6

citizens are non-Indian.
QUESTION2

7

But if a State could prove by some sort

of census and bloodline figures that a majority of its

in saying "a person" has this broader meaning beyond

individuals, then it seems to me the Court would have to

decide is it a question of the predominant, the majority

very reasonable way to draw the line.

QUESTION:

Mrs. Beale, do you think Section 16 of

the statute, as construed in the Perrymand case, is

constitutional?

6

MRS. BEALS:

I would have serious doubts about that.

7

And I also think that, as our brief stated, in retrospect,

8

we think the historical analysis which we promoted at the time

9

is incorrect.

And we would think if the statute came before

to connect up that history, which

J.

about e that there were problems in Georgia at that time with,
what Congress was intending to do in enacting that particular
statute.

We didn't show anyone referred to in the debate

or that it was mentioned in the Committee reports or anything
of that nature, and that‘s why I'm suggesting that perhaps
the line wasn't as clear as the Court thought, and as we
argued at the time.

But the basis of that decision, whether

we find it persuasive or not, I would agree with you, it's
not compelling, is that particular legislative history.

we think it can clearly be distinguished on that basis,

a citation of Wilcox v. Jackson,Corvallis

does suggest that

a question of whether Federal title has been lost is like the
question of Federal law.

But even if we’re not right on that,

even if merely the Federal ownership of

public domain land

is not enough, I think Oneida clearly establishes that there
is an additional peg to our argument when we’re speaking of
Federally-protected Indian land where Congress has specifically
moved to oust the States of jurisdiction and has specifically
claimed for itself the question of when and how Indian rights
are to be terminated.

You can’t really suggest that that’s

Yes, we do, and we. think Federal law
