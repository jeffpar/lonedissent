ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM; W, WENZEL* III* ESQ, *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR0 WENZELs

Mr» Chief Justice* and may it please

the Courts
Petitioner Arthur F® Quern* the current Director
of the Illinois Department of Public Aid* requests this Court
to review and overturn the en banc ruling of the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals* which petitioner submits has
undermined this Court9s ruling in this very litigation in
Edelman vB Jordan.* which established the State11 s sovereign
immunity from suit

under the Eleventh Amendment to the United

States Constitution®
The en banc ruling of the Seventh Circuit authorizes
the federal court to mandate the issuance of a class notice
regarding entitlement to retroactive welfare benefits to more
than 20*000 welfare recipients®

Relief* which petitioner

contends* is designed to secure indirectly the very same
monetary award which this Court prohibited under the Eleventh
Amendment in Edelman,
The facts in this case are not in dispute.

In 1971

plaintiff filed a civil rights class action in the District

4
Court for the Northern District of Illinois„ challenging the
failure of Illinois welfare officials to comply with federal
time standards for processing applications for assistance under
former Title XVI of the Social Security Act, the Aged, Blind
and Disabled Program»
Federal regulations had been issued by the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1968 which established
specific time standards for processing applications»

From

1968 until plaintiff filed his lawsuit, the defendant welfare
officials had processed applications pursuant to State regulations which were inconsistent with the federal time standard»
Accordingly, the District Court, on April 16, 1971,
preliminarily enjoined the welfare officials from enforcing
their own State standard and compelled them to follow the
federal time standards issued by HE;?»
In March of 1972, the preliminary injunction was made
permanent»

In addition, the District Court awarded equitable

restitution for retroactive welfare benefits wrongly withheld
for all those applicants for AABD who had applied between the
date of the issuance of the federal regulation in .196 8 and
April 16, 1971, the date that the Stite regulation had been
declared invalid»
This award of equitable restitution was ultimately
reversed by this Court in Kdelman v» Jordan «is violating the
State's sovereign immunity from suit mder the Eleventh

5

Amendment»
This Court reasoned that an award of equitable
restitution is, in all practical sense, relief against the
State as the real party in interest»

This Court further

reasoned that under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young a federal
court's remedial powers, consistent with the Eleventh
Amendment, are limited to prospective injunctive relief and
may not include a retroactive award or relief which compensates
for pre-litigation conduct or past misconduct which is
completed»
This Court accordingly reversed and remanded the
Seventh Circuit decision to the contrary with instructions to
have further proceedings not inconsistent with the Eleventh
Amendment ruling»
However, on remand in the District Court, the
plaintiff filed a motion to require the State defendant to
issue a notice to each of the 20,000 individuals, or more,
whose applications for assistance had been delayed during the
period of 1968 through 1971, and inform

them of their

possible entitlement to the very same retroactive welfare
benefits that this Court had denied»
And to inform them of their right to appeal through
administrative proceedings the denial of those welfare benefits,
This was over, of course, the State’s objection that
it violated the law of this case, as handed down in Edelmam,

6

and that it violated soverign immunity embodied in the Eleventh
Amendments

The District Court disagreed»

The District Court

viewed notice relief as a relief which did not compensate,
per se, and that Kdelman was limited to relief which compen­
sated per se? and this relief, while related to the possibility
of securing retroactive monetary reward, was something differ­
ent than an actual award itself»
On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, a three-judge
panel of the Seventh Circuit disagreed? it found that the
actual notice that the District Court had allowed contained
a predetermination of State liability, and that this sort of
notice relief, therefore, violated the law of the case and
violated the Eleventh Amendment»
Plaintiff sought a rehearing en banc, which was
granted»

The Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, four judges

to three, decided that the District Court had in fact erred
in the specific notice relief that it had envisioned, because
it did contain a predetermination of the State's liability»
However, the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, did
feel that a federal court could authorize notice relief,
which was related to retroactive welfare benefits, as long as
it did not contain a predetermination of liability»
The Seventh Circuit, in authorizing this "some form
of notice relief", conceded that it would operate against the
State sovereign and not merely against the Director of the

7
Department of Public Aid»
So the issue now before the Court is whether or not
retrospective equitable relief against a nonconsenting soverign
in the form of a notice related to retroactive welfare benefits
is consistent with this Court's decision in Edelnan, or is
consistent with the State's sovereign immunity from suit
under the Eleventh Amendment»
QUESTIONS

How much of a case do you think

we still

have here, in view of the majority of the en banc Seventh
Circuit’s opinion, which, on the State’s appeal, reversed the
judgment of the District Court, but said that if the District
Court were so inclined it could enter a more modest decree?
MR, WENZEL:

Your Honor, the

there is a case of

controversy. We do have a significant controversy, because we
feel that any form of notice relief under this case, which
will ultimately secure members of the plaintiff class the
retroactive benefits which were denied by this Court, will
either violate this Court's ruling in Edelman or violate the
Eleventh Amendment,
QUESTION:

Mr, Wenzel, as a matter of Illinois

law, would the State have the power or authority to give some
retroactive relief for a period prior to April. 8, 1971?
MR» WENZEL:

As a matter of State law, during this

very period in time mentioned, 1968

to 1971 and up through

1974, as a matter of fast, Illinois did participate in a

8
Federal-State scheme of cooperative federalism known as the
Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled Program»

At that time, as

a matter of State law, Illinois would have permitted people
who had been denied assistance to appeal and, if they prevailed
under administrative appeal or if they eventually prevailed in
a judicial review, would have permitted the payment of retro­
active relief»
This case, however, is not that simple, because of
the action of the United States Congress in 1974 in repealing
former Title XVI of the Social Security Act, and replacing it
with the wholly federally funded and authorized Supplemental
Security Income Program»

Therefore, at present, and since 1974,

Illinois has not been participating in a federal program»
So the question becomess

If a particular recipient were to

seek administrative review today, and if he were to go into
State court, ard if the court were to consider the question
whether he was entitled to retroactive relief, I think it would
first have to cleal with the threshold question of whether the
State was still participating in the federal program»

And

it is not today»
QUESTIONs Well, but the district: — the Court of the
Severnth Circuit has, as I read its opinion, left that completely
up to the State court*to determine»

It doesn’t say the State

courts hive to award retroactive relief, it just says that
this class of people may be told that they may have a claim in

9

the State courts and remiss them to the State courts,,
MR0 WENZELs

Your Honor# we view notice relief as

very closely related to an actual award that benefits them­
selves 0
But our position goes further than that, We do not
view the principles of sovereign immunity, not this Court4s
decision in Edelman, as to limit the application of the
doctrine of sovereign immunity to only those cases involving
an actual award of monetary reliefs
We believe that the principles of sovereign immunity
must include those cases which require the sovereign to act
affirmatively# or which triggers the operation of governmental
machinery0

We draw support for that proposition from this

Court's rulings under the issue of federal, sovereign immunity
from suit in the Larson vs, Domestic & Foreign Commerce
Corporation case # and
QUESTION:

——
Mr, Wenzel# before you get too far into

your argument# I want to be sura I've got your entire answer
to the question I put before.

Do I correctly summarize it by

saying that if someone# whether he got this notice or not#
who did not receive benefits during the period prior to April
8# 1971# were now to file some kind of a claim in the Illinois
State system# whether it's administrative or judicial# we
don‘Jt know really whether the State would pay him anything?
is that right?

10

MR® WENZELs
QUESTIONS

That is correct»

And I ~

It’s possible that — either result is

possible, as far as we know from the record and the law that
you nave been able to point out to us? right?
MR® WENZELs

Yes, and I really did not complete my

exposition of the State procesures*

If I could back up, to

answer both Justice Stevens’ and Justice Rehnquist's questions
notice relief will trigger governmental nuichinery and will
intrude upon the sovereign State of Illinois in the following
respects?

the notice will go out? 20,000 or more welfare

recipients will file requests for appeals with the administra­
tive agency? the agency will hold hearings themselves» And,
depending upon the conclusion or the final decision in those
agency hearings, the recipients will have a right to seek
judicial review in the State courts»
If the State court should arrive; at the conclusion
that retroactive assistance should be paid to members of the
plaintiff class, as a matter of State law petitioner, the
Director of the Department, does not have the power to request
the State Comptroller to draw or the State Treasurer to pay
an assistance warrant which relates to an appropriation which
has lapsed,

We are talking here with obligations that relate

to appropriations for the years 1968 through 1971®

Under

Illinois law, those appropriation members have lapsed, the
Director does not have the power nor does the —

11
QUESTION;

Well, but isn’t that just like various

other claims that are asserted against the State?

The claim

may be asserted before the Court of Claims, or whatever it’s
called ~ I forget — and it may be established, and then the
Legislature, the General Assembly in its wisdom decides whether
or not to pay the claim.

So isn't it possible that 20,000

people who did not get money they should have gotten could
establish this sort of claim, and then they might have enough
political influence to get the Legislature to adopt or pass
a bill, saying "Let’s pay the money"?
MR*, WENZEL;
QUESTION;

That is correcta

The next step in —

They really won't have a chance to do

this unless they initiate the claim in the first instance,
MR. WENZEL;

That is correct, so we are at the

point that the Court of Claims, perhaps even ruling in favor
of the

'members of the plaintiff class here, which, under

Illinois lav;, is a mere recommendation to the General
Assembly to pay or not to pay.

But the catch, it seems to me,

is that the federal court that has issued the notice relief
stands ready to intervene at any particular point in these
proceedings, whether they be the administrative, the judicial
or the legislative, and use its powers under Title 28, Section
2283, to protect or effectuate its judgments? to use its
powers under Title 28, Section 2202, to grant further relief.
QUESTION;

But didn’t the Court of Appeals say the

12

one thing they can't do is order payment?
MR» WENZEL:

That is correct, but I think that what

they could do is at each step of the proceeding, whether
administrative, -QUESTION:

They can be sure the notices were mailed,

and they were printed an legible and all that sort of thing»
MR» WENZEL:

— judicial, legislative, they can keep

on intruding into legitimate State affairs and nudging this
matter closer and closer to the point where pavment will occur
even though it couldn't be said directly that the federal court
actually ordered it»
It did everything but, in fact, order»

And we feel

that that is so closely tied up with the actual award of monetary
relief itself that it really amounts to a subterfuge»
QUESTION:

Well, I can understand why you would say

that about the District Court order in this case, but the
Seventh Circuit majority rather substantially modified it,
didn't it?
MR» WENZEL:

It said that it envisioned a notice

which would not contain a predetermination of the liability of
the State»

It did

whatever notice it might send out, however,

I think would include the riqht to appeal thi3 denial of
benefits in the period of 1968 to 1971»

Once we triggered the

fair hearing process, everything else follows — judicial
review, court of claims, the legislative matter»

But then ~

13
QUESTION?
MR. WENZEL:

That's by virfcua of State law.
But assuming that the federal court

would retain power to enforce and protect its notice relief,
it would seen to me that the court is not merelv — the court
stands ready to intrude into State lav? and State procedure, to
sea the desired result of an eventual monetary

award

realized.
\

QUESTION:

I would think if the majority of the

Seventh Circuit felt the way you think it felt, it would simply
have affirmed Judge Will's order rather than reversed it»
I can see why you could say that about Judge Will's order, but
I have some difficulty with your interpretation of Judge Wood's
opinion in the Seventh Circuit,,
MR. WENZEL:

Maybe another way of approaching the

problem is to attempt to delineate what Edelman precludes
in the way of a federal court's remedial power for relief»
This notice, by any stretch of the imagination, is not
prospective»

It must be deemed to be compensatory»

It's

not prospective because it's the only prospective injunctive
relief that was dealt with in 1971 and 1972 for federal time
standards.

There's never been a question of notice relief in

this case»
That leaves us with notice relief, which is designed
to compensate for pre~litigation conduct, and this Court
said in Edelman

that compensatory relief, dealing with past

14
completed misconduct is beyond the powers of a federal court
when the objection of the Eleventh Amendment is raised,,
QUESTIONS

Would there be any objection if some

community organization decided that ~ seiy you win the case*
and then some comm'anity organization decided well, these
people ought to *— these are blind, disabled, elderly people
who were wrongfully denied some money about seven or eight
years ago, or ten? and this community organization thought,
well, they ought to know what their rights are and sent out
precisely the same noticea

Would there be any — would that

have a different consequence?

And if the answer is no, are

we really talking about who pays for the notice?
MR» WENZEL:

The answer would be noD

It would —

I suppose the members of the plaintiff class would be able to
come into the office of Public Aid and request to appeal the
denial of benefits, but we6re talking here —
QUESTION:

No, no»

My question is:

soma do-gooder,

some organization says, well, these people ought to know what
their rights are? and sends out a bulletin in the same words
as the notice the Court of Appeals apparently thought was
appropriate»

Wouldn't that produce all the consequences that

you're concerned about?
MR0 WENZEL:

Yes, but it would*not be as a result of

a federal court's order over the objection of the State that
it's in violation of its right to be free from suit under the

.15

Eleventh Amendment»
QUESTION!

You mean they miqht take it so seriously

if a private association did it? as they would when the
Court of Appeals en banc does so?
MR» WENZELs

Well? especially in the very litigation

in which the prohibition of an award of monetary benefits
has been precluded by this very Court»

We feel very strongly

that what is happening here is they are attempting to achieve
the ultimate goal of retroactive benefits by indirection»
And the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals is aiding and abetting
this indirection? we feel? in violation of this Court9s
decision? and certainly inconsistently with the principles of
sovereign immunity»

Because? because of the federal order to

grant notice relief? there will be a significant intrusion
upon State affairs»

These hearings would? of necessity,

follow, judicial review would follow? and I think it does
matter significantly? Mr» Justice Stevens? that this would
occur as a result of the federal court order and not merely
because some do-gooder? at his own cost and expense? had —
QUESTIONs

Well? the do-gooder could say there's

bean a federal decision? that the State of Illinois wrongfully
denied you money that you were entitled to»
could tell all that»

And the do-gooder

And? in fact? in the Court of Appeals

notice? he need not necessarily recite that it was ordered by
the Court of Appeals

16
MR. WENZEL:

There is one significant difference»

At this point in the proceedings , the only way tlx at the names
and identities of those people who have been denied benefits
in the past would be able to be put together and disseminated
would be as a result of the federal court order which 'viewed
notice relief and identity of members of the plaintiff class
as part of some prospective relief which if had the power to
require the State to put together and disseminate»
So a do-gooder really just putting out a notice as
to what your ~
QUESTION:

He might not be able to benefit the

entire class, just those that don't know their rights, we’d
just let then fall by the wayside, and we'd just protect those
that are on the surface»
QUESTION:
MR» WENZEL:

I see,
I think that notice relief under the

circumstances of this case, in any form, cannot be deemed to
be consistent with the principles of federalism which are
embodied in the Eleventh Amendment»
Those principles of federalism require that there
be a respect for both the Federal sovereign and the State
sovereigns, and that each sovereign should be free to act
consistently within its own sphere of operation under our
Constitution»
In Edelman vs» Jordan and Ex Parte Young, this Court

17
attempted to make sure that both the reaches and proper
applications of the Fourteenth Amendment* as well as the
Eleventh Amendment* are given their full play as long as one
does not require the lessening or the weakening of the otherc
If we are to believe the — what plaintiffs say in
this case about the notions of federalism* in effect we will
have federal courts being able to grant relief which
effectively renders the Eleventh Amendment a hollow shell.
Our notion of federalism* as evidenced by the distinction
between prospective equitable relief tind a retroactive relief
recognized in Edelman* we think is the proper balance,,
And this Court was able to work with the Edelman
distinction between retrospective and prospective in the
Miliken vs„ Bradley case* and was able to find a justification
for wiping out on-going instances of inequality in the Detroit
school system by granting prospective relief which contained
remedial reading programs0
The distinction between prospective and retroactive*
when applied to this particular case* however* shows that we
are talking about relief which is measured in terms of the
past breach of legal duty,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

[1:01 p„m,]
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wenzel, you may

resume, you have about eight minutes left, as I observe»
MR. WENZEL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
If there are no specific questions of petitioner's
counsel at this time, I would like to reserve the balance of
my time for rebuttal.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall.

Mr. Roodman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON H. ROODMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROODMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The central question presented to the Court today
is whether the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the State of
Illinois may be invoked by a State official as a bar to an
order requiring him to send notices to members of a duly
certified class.
This question arises as one aspect of three-pronged
relief granted by the federal court.
First, there has been a declaration by the federal
court that the Director of the Illinois Department of Public

19
Aid promulgated his own administrative regulation contrary to
the Social Security Act* and therefore void under the supremacy
clause,,
Second, in light of this declaration, the federal
court enjoined the future enforcement of these administrative
regulations»
These two aspects of the relief have already been
held by this Court to be consistent with the Eleventh Amendment»
On remand from Jordan I, it must be emphasized that
members of the plaintiff class were wholly in the dark regard­
ing this lawsuit.

Accordingly, the class representative, in

fulfillment of his fiduciary obligations to the class, sought
an order requiring the petitioner to send notices to the
members of the class merely explaining, one, that a federal
suit had been filed on their behalf? two, that they had been
defied certain AABD benefits? three,

that there were pre-existinc

State administrative procedures for challenging the denial of
such benefits? and, four, the method by which they might
trigger those procedures»
QUESTION:

Mr. Roodman, class action procedures have

come into play largely since I left private practice.

Is

that ordinary, as you say, members of a plaintiff class would
be largely in the dark after a remand from this Court in
Edelman, after a decision on the merits?
MR» ROODMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

This was a (d)(2)

20

class under federal law®
QUESTION %
MR® ROODMANs

Injunctive?
Correct.

Under the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure, and therefore no notice is required under the
federal rules , and no notice had been sent to these members of
the class®

Sof after the decision of this Court in Jordan I,
y

they had been — were ordered no notio2 , they had never
received any notice,during the pendency of the case, of the
proceeding®
So the notice that the respondents did seek on their
behalf merely advised them that there had been this lawsuit
pending; it advised them of the declaration of the Court? and
then advised them of pre~existing administrative procedures by
which they might challenge the denial of those benefits®
The Seventh Circuit approved the sending of such
notices, but only to the extent that those notices in no way
predetermined the liability of the State of Illinois®

The

notices which were sent were appropriate, both under Rule
23(d) C2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and also
appropriate as an exercise of the general equitable discretion
of the court®
Further, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the
federal courts have the authority, after entering a declaratory
judgment, to give further necessary and proper relief®
fall within that section as well®

Notices

21
QUESTIONS Well, you0re talking now about an affirma­
tive basis for the District Court's authority to act*

Your

opponents contend that whatever that affirmative authority
might support in other cases,the Eleventh Amendment bars it
here»
MR* RQODMANs

That is correct, Your Honor* That

is the sole basis of their argument before the Court today*
There could be, in other cases, other equitable
considerations that right compel the federal court to decline
to send notices to a class, even after finding a violation of
the Social Security Act.

Those are questions of equity not

in the Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence.
The only question raised before the Court today is
the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the State of Illinois.
We believe a close examination of the principles
of sovereign immunity and federalism, embodied in the Eleventh
Amendment, will show that the petitioner is seeking to use
the Eleventh Amendment in a way in which it was never intended,
and contrary to the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.
I will first discuss the Eleventh Amendment issues
and then turn to the 1983 issues presented in this case.
In Jordan I, this Court reaffirmed the principle
that the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from
entering awards for money damages directly against the State.
This interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment fell within the

22

historical purposes of the Eleventh Amendments
State treasuries from federal court orders»

to protect

Both to avoid a

potential clash between Federal and State sovereigns and also
to prevent a direct and substantial intrusion upon the
sovereignty of the State by the federal courts»

A question of

federalism»
Neither of these historical purposes of the Eleventh
Amendment, however, are in any wa.y jeopardized by the sendinq
of the notices approved by the Seventh Circuit en banc»
The order challenged here by the petitioner does not
result in any clash between the Federal and State sovereigns»
On the contrary, the order respects the institutions of State
Government and leaves to the institutions of State Government
the ultimate determination of the fiscal liability of the
State»
QUESTIONS

What if the order had provided, in addition

to what the Seventh Circuit said it could provide,that
although Illinois law did not provide for any hearing in this
situation, as a matter of federal constitutional law under the
Goldberg vs« Kelly line of cases, a hearing was mandated by
the Constitution, and therefore, regardless of Illinois law,
the Illinois State system would have to give hearings?
MR® ROQDMANs

Your Honor, we believe that that order

as well would be permissible under the Eleventh Amendment»
That order would not displace the State from determining its

23

own question of fiscal liability in accordance with &tate law0
To the extent that the order does not intrude upon central
decisions of the State Government, that are central to its
sovereignty, so that -QUESTION?

Well, it certainly would be imposing a

rather substantial aspect of retrospective relief, would it
not?
MR. ROQDMAN:

Your Honor, it would not necessarily

be imposing such a burden.

That question would be left to the

State.
QUESTION:

Except that the State would be required

to hold a hearing.
MR. ROODMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is the fact

that the petitioner has violated the federal rights of the
members of the plaintiff class, which is central.

There is a

weighing of the federal interest in this case with the State
interest.

We have, a central finding in this case, a viola­

tion of the supremacy clause, a knowing violation of the
supremacy clause.
Thus, there are federal interests at stake in this
case.
What the federal court here has done has accommodated
and harmonised the federal interest with the State interest.
It is done so in a way that is not intrusive upon the State
Government.

It leaves to the State Government the final

24

determination of fiscal matters that are central to State
Government»
The direct —
QUESTION %

I just wondered what was the jurisdic­

tional basis for this suit in the federal court?
MR» ROODMAN:

The original jurisdictional basis

for the lawsuit is Section 1343»
QUESTION s

And your claim was based on the federal

law?
MRe ROODMAN:

Your Honor, the original claim was

based both on the equal protection clause and the supremacy
clause»

The federal court never reached the equal protection

clause, —
QUESTION:

I see»

MR. ROODMAN:

— they relied solely upon the Social

Security Act and the supremacy clause.
Your Honor, we would svbmit that in fact petitioner,
a State officer, is not here seeding to protect the sovereignty
of the State of Illinois®

What he seeks to do is block access

by the respondents to the State-created remedies.

"The

sovereign State of Illinois (a) agree to provide administra­
tive remedies for all public aid recipients who wish to
challenge the denial of

benefits".

part of the Social Security Act.

That requirement was

But the State of Illinois

went even one step further, they provide for judicial review

25

of the administrative decisions of the Director of the Illinois
Department of Public Aid0
So the very procedures and remedies that the sovereign
State has adopted for members of the plaintiff class, the
Director here seeks to prevent

them from utilizing.

We submit that there is no basis for assuming that
the interests of the sovereign State of Illinois are aligned
with the interests of the Director of the Illinois Department
of Public Aid,

The Director of the Illinois Department of

Public Aid originally violated the Social Security Act,
QUESTIONs

Who speaks for the State of Illinois in

this Court?
MR, ROODMAN:

Your Honor, the Attorney General does

represent the Director of the Illinois Department of Public
Aid before this Court,
QUESTIONs

Well, who else would we look to to

hear the views of the State of Illinois?
MR, ROODMAN:

Well, Your Honor, that is the sole

person before the Court today,
QUESTION:

I think ~

Well then, I5m not sure I understand your

prior statement,
MRo ROODMAN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, we think that —

I understood you to say there's nothing

to indicate that the Director is speaking for the sovereign
State of Illinois,

26

MR. ROODMANs

We were maintaining, Your Honor, that

hi3 interests and the interests of the sovereign State of
Illinois are not necessarily aligned.

The sovereign State,

through its Legislature, has adopted explicit remedies for the
respondents in this case to challenge denial of benefits.
Director, on the other hand, is a State officer.

The

It is not

true that in all cases a State officer has the identical
interests of the sovereign, particularly when the State officer
is responsible for the initial violation of law.
We think in cases of this kind the State officer is
seeking to block the respondents from utilizing procedures
the State, through its Legislature, has expressly adopted.
QUESTIONS

How do we resolve this potential conflict

that you imply?
MRo POOOMAN%
QUESTION %

Your Honor, I think ~
That is, do we decide what the State of

Illinois thinks about this?
MRo ROODMAN%

No.

The question is whether the

State officer should be permitted to invoke the immunity of
the State of Illinois.
QUESTION?

Can the Attorney General invoke the

immunity?
MR. ROODMANs

No, Your Honor — the Attorney General,

in representing the State officer here, we think should not
be permitted to invoke the immunity of the State of Illinois,

27
except in those cases in which there is a direct and sub­
stantial intrusion upon the State Government.
This Court held in Jordan I that money damages
against the State are a direct intrusion upon the State and
therefore it is appropriate for the State officer to be able
to invoke the immunity of the State of IllinoisD
In the tax cases of the 1940s, which were claims
for money judgments against the State, once again the State
officer could claim the immunity of the State0
However, in those cases in which — there are no
i

cases, other than money damages cases, in which a State officer
ha3 been permitted to claim the immunity of the State of
Illinois,, or any other State in this nation0
The notice relief here, we submit, does not create a
clash between the sovereign State of Illinois and the national
government through its federal courts,,

Instead, the notice

remedy is a carefully tailored remedy which is designed to
avoid such a clash*

The remedy, by sending the members of the
*

class back to the State institutions, avoids any clash between
the sovereigns*
Ultimately the question, of whether they shall recover
for the benefits that have been denied them is a question for
the State Government to decide through its administrative
agencies and through its judicial branch»
QUESTIONS

Well, the csriginal District Court decree

28

in this case didn’t speak in terms of damage, did it* it spoke
in terms of equitable restitution* suggesting that* you know,
it wasn’t quite as airtight as an award of damages*
So that are you correct in saying that it’s just
strictly and only damages that’s forbidden by the Eleventh
Amendment?
MR* RQODMANs

Money judgments, Your Honor®

Judgments

that have a direct monetary impact upon the State for past
conduct®
This Court did say that the equitable resvitution
was indistinguishable from money damages that had been barred
previously, or money judgments Cor the recovery on bonds,
or the tax cases in which persons sought to recover taxes
that they claim had been illegally exacted from them®
In the absence of a money judgment, and with the
particular notices that have been ordered here, there can be
no problem of enforcement that this Court was concerned about
in cases involving money judgment* ®
against the State officer®

The enforcement is solely

If, in fact, the plaintiffs do

not recover in this case, the Stete officer is not in contempt
of the federal court*
is to send the notices®

The only requirement on the State officer
After i.hat, the questions of liability

are reserved to the State GoverumentG
QUESTIONi

What if the State Executive Branch,

pursuant to your suggestion, decides not to pay, then what -—

29

then they go in the State courts?
MRo ROOD? IAN:
QUESTION:
they should pay?

Yes* Your Honor, we would —■
And what if the State court decides that

Then what happens?

MR. ROODMAN:

Well* I would assume if the State

court decides that they should pay* that the State officer
would respect the judgment of the State: court.
QUESTION:

What if the Attorney leneral says that*

for purposes of illustration* that violates the Eleventh
Amendment and our holdings?
MRo ROODMAN:

The Eleventh Amendment would not apply

in the State courts* Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's why I

posed it —• what if he

asserted that?
MR® ROODMAN:

Our only remedy* Your lonor* would

be within the State court system.

We might pursie remedies

of contempt within the State court system.

He wculd not be

in violation of the federal court order* and ve vould have
no remedy of contempt in federal court* no potential clash
»

between the State sovereign and the Federal sovereign.
QUESTION:

Then* conversely* if the Sta e courts*

in that hypothetical* decide no entitlement* that’s the end
of it* is it?
MR. ROODMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor* that is correct.
Mr. Roodman* what do you do with cases

30

like In Re Ayers and Hagood v, Southern that were cited in
Edelman v, Jordan, where the Court refused to permit suit in
federal court for specific performance of a contract?

Which,

I take it, could well not have involved monetary damages,
MR, RQODMAN %

Your Honor, those cases did involve

collection on bonds, those cases were intended specifically to
recover the payment of principal and interest on bonds, they
did involve money judgments.

Those cases fell within the

historical purposes of the Eleventh Amendment in the original
case of Chisholm vs, Georgia, in which there was a suit for the
collection of money,
QUESTION?

Would you think the Eleventh Amendment

allowed a district court, in a case such as this, to order a
State official to specifically perform a contract in which
the State had engaged, so long as it did not involve actual
payment of money?

Suppose it had involved furnishing of

supplies to a group of people?
MR, RQODMAN;

The question, Your Honor, we think

would turn on principles of federalism.

It would be the

extent to which the federal court order was so intrusive upon
the State sovereign that it should not stand within our federal
system.
That, we think, is the basis, the balancing test
that the federal court would have to apply in that situation.
The question is

throughout the almost 200 years

31
of the Eleventh Amendment, it has always been whether- the
particular relief is consistent with this nationss federalism*
And federalism requires a sensitivity to both the State
interests and the national interests*
In this case; in the absence of such relief; as
approved by the Seventh Circuit en banc, the federal court will
be ignoring and condoning the violation of the federal rights
of the plaintiff class*
In our federal system, the violation of federal
rights cannot go unredressed*

What the lower courts have done

here is to tailor a remedy that is sensitive to those federal
rights and to the supremacy clause of the Constitution, while,
at the same time, recognizing the interests, the legitimate
interests of the State Government and not intruding upon the
institutions of State Government*
By leaving to the State Government the ultimate
determination of liability, the federal court here has
harmonized the interests of the Federal Government, the
federal funds that are at stake in the AABD program, the
federal rights that are involved in the Social Security Ac£,
and, of course, the federal intexest involved in

seeing that

the supremacy clause is adhered to*
The federal interests in this case are quite differ­
ent from those in the tax cases of the 1940s and the bond cases
in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century*

In those cases

32
it was not — there was no program that was based upon coopera­
tive federalism»

There were no federal interests involved

directly in those cases»
QUESTION?

Welle Mr» Roodman, in the tax cases,

wasn8t the claim of Ford Motor Company, for example, that the
tax violated the Federal Constitution?
MR» ROODMANs
QUESTIONs

Yes, but —
Would you say that was not a federal

interest?
MR» ROODMANs

Your Honor, there certainly is a federal

interest in the Fourteenth Amendment*

That question then could

be raised and presented through the State court system and
ultimately considered by this Court»
And what we seek here is no more than in that case*
We seek to have the issues of liability referred back to the
State court system and then determined within the context of
State law in the State court system»
QUESTION?

Well, I was puzzled by your statement

that there were no federal interests of the same magnitude
.involved in the tax cases in the Forties as there were in this
case»

I would think the federal courts sit to vindicate the

Fourteenth Amendment quite as much as they do the supremacy
clause *
MR» ROODMAN?

I certainly would agree, Your Honor»

The point was that in this case there has been a finding of a

33
violation of federal, law that this Court has upheld»

So

that because of the three“*pronged nature of the relief,
there is a finding of a violation of federal law» Whereas, in
the tax cases, the entire matter is referred ab initio to the
State court system for consideration»
The petitioner here does not explain how the notice
relief in any way undermines federalism»

Further, the

petitioner cites no cases in support of his position»

Petitioner

seams to suggest that the State is the real party in interest,
and that the notices will be a burden upon his office»
However, it is important to distinguish between
equitable consideration and Eleventh Amendment considerations»
If 1die class here involved only 500 persons, that is a question
of comparison to the equities of the case»

It is a question

that this Court would weigh in the balance in deciding whether
to send notices»
But the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the State
does not turn on the question of the number of persons in the
class»
What is important here is for the federal courts to
provide a remedy that is co-extensive with the violation»
Unless the federal remedy here, of notices to the members of
the plaintiff class, is approved, then those persons who are
actually harmed by the violation of law would receive no
redress whatsoever

34
The petitioner further argues that the respondents
are seeking to accomplish by indirection what Jordan 1 barred
directly.

It is not true that this Court held in Jordan I that

the members of the plaintiff class were to be barred from
recovering.

What this Court held only was that the federal

court could not order such recovery, and therefore the decision
by the federal court en banc is consistent with the original
decision in Jordan X,
Finally, it is important to take into account also
the principles of federalism embodied in Section 1 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1871, now codified as 1983,
In enacting that provision, Congress clearly
intended to provide an effective federal remedy for infringe»
raent of federal rights by State officers, just as occurred in
this case.

In doing so, Congress recognized that the federal

courts would be Cl) overriding certain State laws, (2) providing
a federal remedy where State law was inadequate, and {3)
providing a federal remedy where the State remedy, though
/

adequate in theory, was not available in practice.
And that is precisely the situation we have today,
A State remedy that is available in theory but not in practice?
a State remedy that is only triggered by the sending of a
notice and unless the members of the plaintiff class have
such notice, they would be unable to utilize those procedures.
Thus, it is consistent with the intent of Congress

35
in 1983 to provide for the sending of notices to these
individuals.

For the State officer here to frustrate the

intent of Congress, there is a heavy burden. The State officer
must be able to show that the remedy appropriate under 1983
is a direct intrusion upon the sovereignty of the State»
In the absence of such a showing, the argument that
the 1983 remedy should be frustrated must fail»
In conclusion, then, we urge the Court to affirm the
judgment of the Seventh Circuit en banc, to hold that the
Eleventh Amendment bars an order merely requiring a State
official to send notices would be inconsistent with the
historical purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, it would be
inconsistent with our federalism, and would be inconsistent
with the congressional mandate embodied in 1983.
Thank you,

Hay I pursue my previous question with

you for a moment?
MR. KOODMAN%
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
Suppose that in this complaint there had

been only the so-called statutory issue, a claim of conflict,
no equal protection issue, would there have been a jurisdic­

MR. ROODMANs

Your Honor, we believe there would he.

This question is now —
QUESTIONS

MR® RDODMANs

If we are wrong on that question, that

would not disturb in any way the Court9s affirmance of the
order of the; Seventh Circuit»

Well, just take my examples

only the

statutory claims, is in the complaint®
MR® ROODMAN:
QUESTION:
two questions®

Excuse me, you mean jurisdictionally?

Yes®

Was there any ~ 1511 ask you

Do you think you state a cause of action, if

there was only that claim in the complaint?

And, secondly,

if you did, would there be jurisdiction in the federal courts?
HR® ROODMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, to both questions®

This Court, in fact, in Jordan I, expressly held
that 1983 was an appropriate cause of action for enforcing the
Social Security Act®
QUESTION:

We would find jurisdiction —
Under the “and laws'9 part of 1983? is

that it?
MR® ROODMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, there is the dual --

both under the constitutional language of 1983 as well as the
"and laws59 —
QUESTION

Well, let9s assume that 1983 did not

reach "and laws'8,,
MR® ROODMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes 0
Would there be a jurisdictional problem

in my example?
MR® ROODMAN:

Your Honor, we would have jurisdiction

under 1331, this is a question* arising under the Constitution,
we would claim that in this case there is in excess of $10,000,
QUESTION:

Yes, but there your cause of action would

be arising under the Social Security Act®
MR® ROODMAN:

If we were then to claim that the

cause of action for the violation of the Social Security Act
was not a question also under 1331?
QUESTION:

Yes®

Well, if IS83 does not reach all

federal statutes and the Social Security Act isn't covered by
1983, and you went in under 1331, attempting to state a cause
of action, you would have to successfully claim that the
Social Secujrity Act gives a private
MR® ROODMAN:

cause of action,,

Well, we would have — Your Honor,

in addition there is the Declaratory Judgment Act, which
provides a cause of action®

And we would seek equitable

relief under the -- first, a declaratory judgment that the
acts of the State officer were contrary to federal law and
the supremacy clause®

Then, pursuant to that declaration,

we would seek equitable relief to enjoin the future violation
of the Social Security Act®

38

So we would have no remedy adequate at law , the
plaintiffs would be suffering irreparable injury, and therefore
we would meet the test under equitable jurisdiction, under
normal equitable principles, to secure an injunction against
the acts the State officer is in violation of*

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Wenzel?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. WENZEL,III, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WENZEL:

In response to counsel's comments, I

would like to return to what I think are two crucial facts
that are particular to this case, which are decisive of the
issue of whether any form of notice relief is appropriate
under this Court's decision in Edelman and the Eleventh
Amendment.
,

Those two facts are:

one, when plaintiff brought

his complaint in federal court in 1971, he alleged that he
had no available administrative remedies? paragraphs 27 and
39 of the complaint, Appendix A-12 and A“14b
He purposefully chose to ignore his right to seek a
hearing in State court.

And now, some six cr seven years

later, he's back in court saying that now he’s entitled to
notice.
The second crucial fact —

41
QUESTION?

I thought he was now saying the class is

entitled to notice«
MR® WENZELs

That is correcto

In fact, the plain­

tiff, Mr0 Justice Marshall, Mrc Jordan has received his
retroactive benefits, so he would not even be —*®
•>

QUESTIONS
MR» WENZELs

•»

That was declared»
The second crucial fact, I believe, is

that in 1974 Congress repealed former Title XVI of the Social
Security Act»

Any right to notice or a hearing, which members

of the plaintiff class may have had in 1971, I believe are
extinguished by the fact that there are no longer any rights
or obligations with respect to notice, which are binding on
QUESTION*

Well, both of these propositions are

propositions that may be — that will presumably be considered,
and may be accepted by the State administrative agencies or
courts, i»e„, that there's no administrative remedy or (b) if
there may have once been, now Congress has repealed the law
so there now no longer is»

But that's a matter for the State

courts to determine»
That doesn't really directly bear on the Eleventh
Amendment question in this case, does it?
MR» WENZELs

Well, we back up to whether or not

the notice -- whether or not it will ultimately —•
QUESTIONS

It may be the notice is a vain thing,

it's a futility maybe, but that again doesn't directly bear on

42

the Eleventh Amendments
MR» WENZEL:

In so far as notice will trigger the

requests for hearings, the hearings themselves, judicial
review, possible action by the legislative, it9s triggering
governmental machinery which, as far as we9re concerned,
substantially intrudes upon the sovereign and violates the
sovereign*^ freedom from suit»
Counsel for the plaintiff stated that the State
officer is not seeking to protect the State, but to block
access to State remedies? and I think we’ve sufficiently dealt
with thate

The fact that we are no longer operating under

former Title XVI.
Federalism, plaintiffs assert, requires a balancing
of the competing interests of the State and the Federal
Government»

I think what plaintiff is trying to do in this

case is confuse the notion of federalism as used in cases, in
Younger vc Harris, which is, as I understand it, a prudential
notion of federalism,,

But federalism is inherent in every

Eleventh Amendment controversy.
Federalism here must take into account that the
Eleventh Amendment renders an absolute bar to jurisdiction
of the federal courts.

This Court: has said so in Monaco v„

Mississippi, and the Eleventh Amendment must be given effect
as far as it reaches. So it's not really a question of
balancing interests, and for every violation of federal law

43

there must be a remedy»
The point is that if the suit is essentially against
the State, the State is free to assert its Eleventh Amendment
immunity from suit»
