ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. POLLACK, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. POLLACK:

lit*. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The central issue in this case may ha stated as
follows:
Does the Investment Company Act of 1940 deprive the
disinterested directors of a mutual fund of their power to
terminate a stockholders' derivative action which those
directors in good faith have concluded is contrary to the best
interests of the fund and its shareholders?
The District Court held that the disinterested
directors in the exercise of their good faith business judgment
have the power to terminate such an action.

The Court of

Appeals held it as a matter of lav that the directors have no
such power irrespective of the fact that they acted in good
faith*
Certain subsidiary issues are also raised in this
case and they will emerge in my later discussion of the Plain­
tiff s' point in this case.
The facts are set forth chronologically in our main

4
brief,, the white-cover brief, at pages 4 through 19 and in the
interest of moving promptly to the central legal issue in this
case, I will simply summarize the highlights at this point.,
In November,, 1969 Fundamental Investors, the Mutual
Fund involved in this case, purchased $20 million of the
commercial paper of Penn Central.

The commercial paper of

Penn Central was rated prime, the highest rating by NCO, a
subsidiary of Dunn and Bradstreet which is the foremost inde­
pendent rating agency in the United States.
In June, 1970, Penn Central filed for reorganisation
and defaulted on the notes.

Numerous people were caught in the

default as well as Fundamental Investors, banks, trust com;'.j i

charities, universities, many other sophisticated and

able investors.
In November, 1970 the Board of Directors of Fundamen-»
tal authorized a lawsuit against Goldman, Sachs, the dealer
which had sold the paper.

That suit proceeded, vigorously

for several years as part of a multi-district proceeding.
In February, 1973, three years after the purchase,
two stockholders holding very minimal shares filed a derivative
action against Anchor Corporation, the investment advisor to
Fundamental, and against the directors of Fundamental at the
tii.:

of the purchase; that is to say, the 1969 directors.
That action was stayed by Judge Gerfein pending re­

solution of the claims of Fundamental Investors against

5
Goldman, Sachs»
In July, 1974 on the eve of trial of the action
between Fundamental and Goldman, Sachs there was a settlement
pursuant to which Fundamental was paid $5,250,000 in cash and
also the balance o£ their claim in the notes of Penn Central
in reorganization.
QUESTION?

The Board of Directors —
Has the value of those yet been ascer­

tained?
MR. POLITICKs
record, Your Honor.

The essae t value is not a matter of

However, I believe that the current in­

dication is that the additional paper may be worth as much as
$3 or $4 million.
The Board of Directors of Fundamental promptly con­
vened and determined that it would review the Lasher action?
that i« to say, the derivative action and that the five disin­
terested directors among them who were not defendants in the

I.. ’:irt ‘action,

who had not been directors at the time of the

purchase and who were not affiliated in any way with Anchor
would, constituting a quorum, determine what posture the Fund
should take with respect to that action.
Those five disinterested directors thereupon retained
independent special counsel, former Chief Judge of the Stata
of -"or York, Stanley H. Fuld and they instructed him to prepare
a comprehensive memorandum and report on the sub; act.
Judge Fuld studied the matter for several months and

6
in December issued a report to the disinterested directors in
which he concluded that neither Anchor nor any of the fund
directors had violated any law or any contractual or other
obligations to Fundamental Investors»
The disinterested directors then deliberated ■ft :
matter among themselves in a series of special meetings»
interroga ted people in the Fund»
from Anchor.

They interrogated people

They questioned Judge Fold.

cv“:®> r?.vely among themselves.

They

They communicated

They had no contact with

anyone from Anchor,

In early January 1975 those five disinterested
directors put the matter to a vote and unanimously determined
that th© maintenance of this derivative action against the
advisor and the directors was contrary to the best interests
of -the Fund and they determined that they would move to dismiss
the suit.
The motion to dismiss was filed.

Judge. Worker said

that the disinterested directors acting for the Eoard had the
power to determina in the good faith exercise of their business
judgment that this suit should be terminated•
QUESTIONS

This action was taken by a. quorum, a law­

ful quorum of the Board, was it not?
MR. POLLACK:

Yes it was, Mr. Chief Justice and in

that respect, the Plaintiffs at the time of the motion to dis­
miss before Judge Worker questioned the independence of these

7
disinterested directors and Judge Worker promptly ordered dis­
covery on. •'idle subject.
There was extensive discovery spanning several months.
Over 1,000 pages of testimony was taken.
document productions.

There were several

The motion was then renewed and Judge

Werker found that there was no basis, no factual basis to
question the independence of these directors and he granted
the motion to dismiss.
Thereafter, the Court of Appeals reversed.

They

held that as a matter of law, irrespective of whether the
directors had acted in good faith, they were deprived by the
investment Company of the power to make such a decision on
behalf of

the Fund.
In effect, the Court of Appeals, although it did not

use those words, said the disinterested directors could not
be trusted.
I turn to the legal analysis at this point.
The starting point of the legal analysis is Delaware
Corporation Law Section 141(a) .

The Court will find that re­

produced in the Mdendum to our main brief, the white-covered
’

»•*

«

•• - **»wa. t

The language of 141(a) says just this;
The business and affairs of every corporation or­
ganised under this chapter shall be managed by or under the
direction of a Board of Directors.

a
Fundamental is a Delaware Corporation.

It fits

squarely within that provision and wa believe that the direc­
tors of Fundamental as a Delaware Corporation had and have
the power to manage the affairs of the corporation.
This Court has long held in a line of cases going
back 75 to 100 years that that power includes the power to de­
termine whether or not claims shall be prosecuted on behalf of
the corporatior.u
This Court in the Corbus and United Copper cases,
which are the two seminal cases following Hawes, said as
follows — and I quote two sentences from Corbus:

"A court, of

equity may not be called upon at the appeal of any single
stockholder to compel the directors of the corporation to
enforce every right which it may possess irrespective of other
considerations.

It. is not a trifling thing for a stockholder

to attempt to coerce the directors of a

corporation to an act

which their judgment does not approve or to substitute his
judgment for theirs.."
Now, that states the business judgment rule as it
has been enunciated by this Court.
We turn to the second point in the legal analysis.
QUESTION

If all of the. directors were directors

at the time of the alleged erroneous action, negligent or
wrongful action on the part of the corporation and the deriva­
tive shareholders sued them all, then he could, in fact, do

9
exactly that.
MR. POLLACK:
QUESTIONi

Arguably, ha can.

It is don® all the time in derivative

suits, is it not?
MR. POLLACK:

Arguably that is so, Mr. Justice

Stewart but that does not deal with a case such as here where
there is a quorum that can pass on the matter.
QUESTION:

But that language is a little broader

than the facts of life, is it not?
MR. POLLACK:
QUESTION:

I pass on that one,

Your Honor.

Well, are you suggesting

that what you

read from is a federal rule?
MR. POLLACK:

No, 1 am suggesting that tine rule of

this Court, which has been applied through the years and has
guided the interpretation of all courts —
QUESTIONa

Where would this Court get a rule like

that?
MR. POLLACK:

This Court was faced with the question.

It is a Pre-Erie case, agreed but it was faced with the question
as to the powers of directors as a matter of general corporate
law.
QUESTION:

So I would take it you probably do not

agreed with the United States‘ Amicus brief in this case.
MR. POLLACK:

With the United States, Your Honor?

We agree with some aspects of their

.

Insofar as they say

10
that the Investment Company Act is the source of power and
governance I do not agree.
QUESTION?

But you would not think there is room

for a federal rule in this case at all.
MR. POLLACK:

We can well-under stand the argument

for the federal rule in this case? Your Honor.
QUESTION

But now how about — do you agree with

the United States or not?
MR. POLLACK:

OUr first choice and the logical point

of departure is that this is a matter of state law and we hold
to that position.
QUESTION:

That is what I wanted to know.

So you

do not think that there is any room for a federal rule in
t

this case.
MR. POLLACK:

Ho, that is not so, Mr. Justice White.

What 1 nay is that as a principal starting point what I say
is that as a principal or starting point we say state law
governs.
However? we recognise that under the Investment
Company Act this Court could say that the policies of the Act
are so important that it will be taken out of the hands of the
.states for regulatory purposes.
l recognize that that is the thrust of footnote 11
by Your Honor in the Santa Pe opinion and we are content to
live with either side of that equation.

We think the more

13

-

orderly way to decide it is as a matter of state law.
However, we are also content to have the matter de­
cided as a matter of federal law within the policies of the
Investment Company Act.
QUESTION3

I thought your argument, and maybe X am

just saying the same thing in another way or maybe I misunder­
stand your argument, was that this is a matter of Delaware law
where this place was, this outfit was incorporated,
MR. POLLACK:
QUESTION,:

Yes.

Until or unless there is something in the

Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act
or somewhere else in federal law that tells us that Delaware
law shall not control in this or that respect,
MR. POLLACK::

That is exactly ray argument,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION;

-And upon your examination of the federal

laws yon find that there is nothing there to supercede Delaware

law.
MR, POLLACK:

That is our position, Your Honor,

That is precisely our position.
QUESTION:

So you disagree with the United States,

then.
MR. POLLACKs
QUESTIONs

Well, I think —

I mean, that is your first preference, is

MR. POLLACK:

Our first preference is state

12
law.
QUESTION;

You can understand their argument.

You

just do not agree with it.
MR. POLLACK:

Correct but even under their argument

QUESTION:

Yes, I understand that.

QUESTION:

You come out the same way.

MR. POLLACK;

We come out the same v/ay.

v
The

directors do have the power under the investment Company Act.
QUESTION:

Disinterested directors.

MR. POLLACK:

The disinterested directors, abso­

lutely, Your Honor.
I turn now to the opinion of the Court of Appeals.
The starting point was Delaware lav;.

The Court of Appeals

said that under the Investment Company Act the disinterested
directors were deprived of their power.
We believe that this is a misconstruction of the
Act, the legislative history of the Act and the cases under
the Act.
As regards the Act itself first, I point out to
the Court that nowhare does it expressly purport to remove this
power from the disinterested directors.
Next, I point out — as the SEC has said in its
brief — that when Congress meant to .remove such power it did
so expressly.

For example, in Section 36(b).

Furthermore, a reading of the act and its structure

13

indicate clearly that Congress placed great trust in these
people and did not have the same jaundiced view of the disin­
terested directors as held by the Court of Appeals here.
Section 10 provides that 40 per cent of all direc­
tors of a mutual fund must be disinterested.
Section 15 provides that these are the directors, these dis­
interested directors who must pass upon and. approve the very
sensitive issue of the contract, the advisory contract between
the fund and the advisor.
We do not believe that Congress would have vested
that power in the directors had they believed, as the Court of
Appeals did, that they were not to be trusted.
QUESTIONThe statutory requirement of 40 per cent
disinterested directors came into the Act in the 19—what-70
amendment?
MR. POLLACKs
immediately. Your Honor.

I do not have the answer to that
I believe that it preceded it but

the disinterested director category came in in the 1970 amend­
ment .
QUESTION;

It was formally unaffiliated.

MR. POLLACK:

Correct and I believe that the 40 per

cent requirement preceded the 1970 amendment so I will check
that.
QUESTIONs

But 1 mean when

did these directors —

these directors were not directors at the time of the purchase

14
of the Penn Central Railroad»
MR. POLLACK:

That is correct. Your Honor.

None of

these five were on the board at that time.
QUE5TI0N2

All right.

MR, PGLLACKs

One came on the board, in 1971, one in

1972, two in 1973 and one in 1974.
QUESTION:
they meet

And there is no question, is there, that

at least the statutory definition, of being dis­

interested director s,
MR. POLLACK:
not only the statutory
QUESTIONs

No question, Your Honor, that they meet
definition —

What about the fact that they were dis­

interested?
MR. POLLACK:

Well, Judge VJerker did, in fact, find

that, they ware disinterested.
QUESTION;

I know that because your opponent keeps

talking about it.
MR. POLLACKt

Act.

Yes„

I have addressed myself to the

I pass now to the5, legislative history.,

amendments, Congress added a new Section, 2(a)

In the 1970

19.

in that

reotion which created the new category of disinterested direc­
tors, they sought to remedy the criticisms of the prior cate­
gory of unaffiliate:! directors and they filtered the new defini­
tion of disinterested directors., which was a far more stringent
one to qualify through the Act in Section 10, Section 15,

15
Section 32«

We believe, as the Senate report 91-184 shows —

and we have quoted that in our brief — that Congress believed
that in so doing it, had created the necessary sinews in these
directors to fulfill the functions of passing on matters that
involved the advisor.
Finally, the cases under the Act,
casas which we believe to be relevant,

There are three

We recognize that they

are in some respects distinguishable? Tannenbaum, Fogel and
Kauffman» The logic of them is not distinguishable.
In each of those three cases the Court of Appeals —
in twc cases for the Second Circuit and in one case for the
First Circuit — it was clearly indicated that there is a
business judgment rule applicable to mutual funds.
We do not believe that the. plaintiffs have come up
with a single case or that the Court of Appeals came up with
a single case which shows in any way that the Investment
Company Act deprived the disinterested directors of their busi­
ness judgment powers.
In that regard, we are pleased, of course, by the
position of the government in this case because the SEC in a
rare display of support for a defendant, has said as its cen­
tral thesis — and supporting our central thesis of power in
th: disinterested directors here and 1' quote from their brief.
* Although Congress could have prohibited the disinterested
directors from exercising business judgment in the circumstances

16

of this! case, it did not do so/
QUESTION %

Whose quote is that?

MR. POLLACKt
Your Honor,

That is from the SEC brief at page 21,

So the SEC thus supports the fundamental premise

on which our position is based.
Not only that, they go on to recognize that which
is the fact and that is that the business judgment rule is it­
self an important shareholder protection device.
The rule of the Court of Appeals here would wipe
that away in the context of mutual funds.
QUESTIONi

The SEC both does and does not support

your theory but from what you have quoted it would seem to
follow that it is in the discretion, the unreviewable discre­
tion of the indepen lent disinterested directors, a majority
of th

quorum, to make decisions on behalf of the corporation.
MR. POLLACKS
QUESTIONs

I believe the ~

But then the SEC says — well, we will

hear from them, 1 know, but in this kind of a case, since it
is a mutual company it is incumbent upon the District Court
to look at the fundamental fairness and rectitude of the
decision.
MR. POLLACK s
three-prong test.

Mr. Justice Stewart, the SEC has a

The directors have to be independent.

They

have to ba informed and the judgment must be reasonable.

They

acknowledge in their brief, I believe, that the first two

1?
prongs of the test are met ~QUESTION£

In this case.

MR. POLLACK;
QUESTION:

In this case.

So then it is incumbent upon the district

judge to see if it was a reasonable decision.
MR. POLLACK:

Correct and I will address myself to

the issue of reasonableness.
QUESTION:

It would seem to follow from what you

have quoted to us that it is not incumbent at all on anybody
if the directors have the power,
MR. POLLACKs I believe that classically under the
business judgment rule as it has been formulated in the eases
in this Court that is so.

We do believe, however, that even

if the SEC test were to be adopted we would meet that test.
We believe that as to reasonableness that is per­
fectly implicit,

fudge Worker would not have dismissed this

case, we believe, if he believed that the decision was unrea­
sonable.

Furthermore, in their -QUESTIONs

It seems to me that <a judge who was per­

suaded by your argument, that this is within the unreviewable
power of disinterested directors to make the decision would
have dismissed the case even if he — or might well have dinmissed the case —- would have, even if he had thought fch^t this
decision might have been a very unreasonable decision.
MR. POLLACK:

Mr. Justice Stewart, arguably that is

18

so but I would Ceil] Your Honor's attention to the Craner case
where they formulate it a little differently from the SEC.
They say that the judgment must be made — exercise of business
judgment must be made in good faith»
implicit in that is that they be independent and
informed and that, the judgment not be so unreasonable as to
fall outside the bounds of sound discretion.

In other words

they speak, in effect, of a zone of reasonableness or the
bounds of sound discretion.
QUESTION s

It seems to me the logic of your argument

and indeeed the logic of the language of the SEC brief that
you quoted to us leads to a conclusion that would exclude any
oversight by a federal judge of whether or not the decision
was reasonable.

However, maybe not,,

MR. POLLhCK:

Judge Worker also • did point out in

hip opinion expressly that he found that this was a reasoned
decision.

In footnote 16 of their brief the SEC equates a

reasoned determination with reasonableness.
I think that before I sit down at this point in
tine I would like to address briefly the two subsidiary issues
raised by the Plaintiffs.

They raise the question as to

whether a minority of the full board can take this action.
believe that, that has no legal force.

The question is, is

there a quorum?
Section 141 fa) of Delaware law is quite clear on

We

19

the subject that a quorum, albeit a minority of the board, has
the power to transact the business of the corporation,,

There­

fore —
QUESTIO^'?

In that sense, would you say it is anala-

gous to the law which permits six members of this Court to
sit as a quorum and if six members are here, four, although
a minority, less than a majority of the full Court, may make
a binding holding of the Court?
MR. POLLACK:

I pondered that very analogy , Your

Honor, under 28 U.S.C, 1 which I reviewed the other evening,
I think there is a distinction and I think perhaps Mr. Justice
Marshall did put his finger on it.

The difference is, while

it is a minority of the full board that is acfcina, the quorum
itself in the case of the court cannot be a minority because
I believe pur quorum rale is six out of nine.
QUESTION:

Yes but if four of those six decide some­

thing, is not that a holding of this Court?
MR. POLLACK:

Yes, it is, Your Honor but if the

quorum «—
QUESTIONt

It may be regarded as less significant

at some time in the future but in the context of that particu­
lar decision it makes the law of the case.
MR, POLLACK:

Absolutely, no question about that,

Your Honor and the concept of quorum is imbedded in corporate
law in this country for many, many years.

20
QUESTION s

And what does the Delaware law provide,

again?
MR. POLLACK:

Delaware law 141(a) I believe provides

that a quorum can transact the business of the board and it
may be a minority.
QUESTIONs

Yes, but does it say —

MR. POLLACK %

It can be as little as one-third if

the By-Laws so permit and in the case of Fundamental

the By-

Laws had a one-third quorum^ so that —
QUESTION:

So that the By-Laws actually say, wrth

a minimum of one-third.
MR. POLLACKs
a quorum.

Actually, the five here were more than

Four would have been a quorum.

Five actually acted.

The other point that I wish to address before 'I
3it

down at this point is their concept that once a derivative

action it: validly commenced under Rule 23.1 it can never be
terminated and i: fact what they say is, if you put the key in
the lock and you once get the door open, you throw away the key.
Obviously, that makes no sense at all because the
diraetors are the ones charged with the oversight of the busi­
ness of the corporation and they must have continuing power to
review the matters of the corporation and determine on a continning basis what is in the best interest of the corporation.
We believe that fell© demand requirement is a pro­
cedural requirement which speaks only as of the time of the

21
institution of the suit.

It does not and cannot forevermore

strip the directors of their power to act for the corporation
and vest control of fch© corporat® destiny in a single stock­
holder.
Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr, Ferrara,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR, RALPH C. FERRARA, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF S.E.C. as amicus curiae
MR, FERRARA%

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The Securities and Exchange Commission believes that
an understanding ot the relationships between state and federal
lav/ as they impact upon the governance of investment companies
is critical to a resolution of the issues presented in this
case,
First, va agree with the Petitioners that corporate
diregtorn and not. federal judges should be given the fullest
opportunity under state law under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 to manage the business affairs of investment companies.
On the other hand, we agree with the Respondents
and the Court of Appeals that the Investment Company Act of
1940 superimposes: upon basic state law provisions a pervasive
array of federal controls, controls which we believe create
federal standards to assure the operation of the act will not
be frustrated by the possible laxity

of the law of an

22
individual state,
Now, the proper reconciliation of both the state
and federal interests we believe would neither prohibit as a
matter off federal law the disinterested directors of an invest­
ment company from terminating even nonfrivolous derivative liti­
gation nor, however, would that law or would that reconcilia­
tion embrace the most recent state court formulation of the
Delaware business judgment rule as the sole standard by which
to judge directorial action*
Rather, we believe that the state and the federal
interests can be balanced by according full discretion to the
directors5 judgments so long as they are independent, they are
fully informed and they act reasonably.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ferrara, do you find this

federal limitation and requirement in the fiduciary obligations
imposed by the 1940 Act. and in the general purpose of Congress'?
Is that correct?
MR. FERRARA:

That goes to the heart of our authority,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

It has to be found somewhere.

MR. FERRARA:
QUE3TION:

It does, indeed.

And I think ~

Now tell me, where do I find it?

MR. FERRARA:

I think that Section 36(a) off the

Investment Company Act. fiduciary standards, tit® provision of
the Act that imposes upon disinterested investors of an

23
investment company the responsibility

to not breach fiduciary

duties is the heart of our argument but around that argument
is a regulatory statute# a federal regulatory statute which
superimposes an array of controls upon the composition of the
board of directors, how directors are selected, the manner in
which *—
QUESTIONS

Thera is no claim, that any of those pro-

visons were violated in this case# is there'?
MR. FERRARA!

No# we do not but we do say that

surrounding Section 36(a) there are those other controls.
QUESTION %

The numbers*

MR. FERRARA;
QUESTION;

You find it in the numbers,

That is correct, sir.

But there is no problem about any of

those things in this case, on the basis of the majority.
There is full compliance, whether they are applicable or not.
MR. FERRARA;

Well, recall, Mr, Chief Justice, that

.Section 36(a) of the Act, the General Fiduciary Standard,
proscribes breaches of fiduciary duty involving personal mis­
conduct and the House and the Senate, at the time they enacted
huose provisions in 1970 said -*•»
QUESTION;

Well, you would not need Congress to

fell a state court that, would you?
MR. FERRARA;

Well, you might.

Unfortunately,

tue District Co-art judge in this case found that all state law
vouxd require ia that the directors be independent and act in

24
good faith.
The Congress was required in the Investment Company
Act of 1940 that there be an additional ingredient; that is,
that the decisions be reasonable.

That additional ingredient

£inds its heart in Section 36(a),as I said a moment ago

in the

House and Senate reports that accompany the enactment of that
section, where they provided, in these words, that "36(a) pro­
scribed nonfeasance of duty and abdication of responsibility,"
Those words go far beyond, we think, the typical
fraud statute that is found in one of the federal securities
laws.

They expand upon notions of fiduciary duty as found even

in Delaware law.
Now, does that mean that Delaware law has to be disifpi abed by a federal standard?

No,

But does it mean that when

the'Delaware statute or an Idaho statute or an Ohio statute
says that directors shall be accorded the business judgment
rule and the courts of that state say that the business judg■

MR. FERRARA:

Does

it have anything to do with private

MR. FERRARA:

The issue that you are implicitly

raising, Mr. Justice Stevens, is whether there is; an implied
right of action under Section 36(a) of the Investment Company
Act.

That is an issue that is specifically not, in this case.
However, the courts have found that notwithstanding

the language of the statutes that the commission may bring an
action to enjoin that there is a private right of action under
Section 36

As a matter of fact, the courts have rather consis­
tently held that position although, again, that is not an issue
in this case.

QUESTION:

You are really going one step beyond that.

What yen» are in effect saying is that not only dees 36 (a)
authorise the SEC to bring an action, it also implicitly au­
thor! sas a private action and beyond that it places certain
restrictions on the power of independent directors to settle
such an action after it has been brought.
MR. FERRARA:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I am sure that

26
the day is going to come when myself or one of ray successors
is going to be hssre arguing the case that 36 {a} creates an
implied right of action for private litigants under the Investmant Company Act,

We do not have fe© take that position now,

Nor does this case involve the Commission's power to bring an
injunctive action under Section 36(a).
All it does say is that whoever has the right to
bring the action, the private party or the Commission, the
standard upon which the action has to be based is the breach

of fiduciary duty.

durally.

Now* you are quite correct proes-

This ease involves the disposition of a derivative

action in the context where a federal district court judge was
being asked in a contested claim and an involuntary dismissal
whether tha action should be dismissed and the federal district
court judge was faced with the situation of whether to dismiss
the action over the objections of the Plaintiffs who had insti­
tuted the action.
?.'■*

that context, the federal district court judges

was forced to sort out the basis upon which he dismissed the
action and he die. that by, we think, reference to both stata
law standards, the Delaware law — independence and good faith —
and by reference to the federal standards.
I quit© frankly think that if Taim@raha.am against
"filler, the case that we cite as authority for the three-prong
test that we urge in our brief, had been decided at the time
this district co-art judge had before him the dismissal of this

MR. FERRARA:

That is what —

Wo but the question is not whether or

not they can settle a lawsuit but whether in the process of
settling a lawsuit they breach their fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the fund.

A disinterested director or any

director of an investment company simply cannot, without
reference to any standard — without reference tc any standard.

MR. FERRARA:

You have raised two questions.

Let

me try to respond to your first question which is also
Mr. Justice Stevens* question and ~
QUESTION:

All right* fine* you may respond to

Mr. Justice Stevens* question.
MR. FERRARA:

First* the Investment Company Act

clearly defines the composition of a Board of Directors; 40
par cent must be disinterested.,
Now* in all actions taken by those directors* dis­
missal??, of lawsuits, purchases of securities, whatever the
directorial action calls for* those directors* conduct is
guided by Section 36(a).

Section 36(a) says that whatever the

director is doing* dismissing a lawsuit or otherwise, that
director could not breach a fiduciary duty,
The House and the Senate say what a fiduciary duty
is and that is* non-feasance of duty or abdication of responsi­
bility.

Consequently* in deciding whether the directors lived

up to their responsibilities under Section 36(a) in this case*
one has to determine whether they abdicated their responsi­
bility or engaged in non-feasance.
Now* returning -■*
QUESTIONi

We have always had the fiduciaries

vis-a-vis the shareholders.
MR. FERRARA:
Mr. Justice Stewart,
because of

No, always -- you are quite right,

All directors are fiduciaries but hers

Section 36(a) I suppose you would say investment

company directors are super fiduciaries, particularly disin­
terested directors because there is no other federal statute,
not the Securities Act, not the Securities Exchange Act, not
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of IS34, 1935 — no
other federal statute has an express provision that says that
these directors have to have a fiduciary duty.
Recall, this was not green against Santa Fe *—
getting back to the question of yours — this is not Green
against Santa Fe, this is not a Section 10(b)5 that involves
fraud, deception or manipulation.

This is a Section 36(a)

that

talks in terms of breach of the fiduciary duty.
Now, turning to the question about Port against. Ash
and Green against Santa Fe, clearly, the Court in those cases
said that state law is not going to be displaced unless there
is a federal statute which expressly calls for that.

Mr. Ferrara, I would like to ask you a

of questions.

Let us assume that we agreed with the

position of the commission remanding the case for the applica­
tion of your three-part test, the third part of which has been
the subject of a good deal of discussion.
What do you think the district court would do in the
way of determining whether or not the independent directors
had exercised a reasonable judgment — and here I pause to say
that the district judge had a very substantial amount of infor­
mation before him.

Do you think he could act on that informa­

tion, Judge Fuld3s report, the discussions of the independent
directors with independent experts?

Or do you think he would

38
have to have another full-blown trial-, evidentiary trial?
MR. FERRARAs

It is a very difficult question.

Let me try to respond at two levels,,

First, it is hotly con­

tested in this case whether or not the judge allowed a suffi­
cient amount of discovery to go forward to pass upon the ques­
tion of the independence and good faith of the directors.
The judge, we think, on remand —
QUESTION j

That is a question separate from rea­

sonableness .
MR. FERRARAs

I know it is but you asked, I think,

two questions.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FERRARA:

One, what would the district court

judge have to do in terms of the record and two, what would he
have to do in terms of satisfying the reasonableness standard.
QUESTION:

Yes.

- MR. FERRARA:

In terms of the record, the first

determination ha would have to make is whether or not there
was a sufficient record before him to pass upon the reasonable
ness of the directors'" actions.,
I think that there are two views on that.

The

Respondents would urge — I am sorry — the Petitioners would
urge that the district court judge too closely circumscribed
their ability to seek discovery on the question of the merits
of the action.

I believe that the district court judge, in

39
looking at the discovery that was permitted, may find that
adequate discovery was had but the district court judge in his
sound discretion would have to determine that.
1 do not se© and I think it would be wrong to say
that the district court judge would have to conduct thereafter
a full trial on the merits.

they were expatiated on in Judge fold’s memo, X think we would

largely responsible for it.
MR. EINSTEINs

Thank you, ¥©«r Honor.

I was not the

least bit anxious.
Mr. Chief Justice.

May it plea.se the Courts

Late in 1969, the Mutual Fund her® purchased
$20 million worth, cf Penn Central notes.

The record clearly

establishes that it. entered into this purchase at the sugges­
tion of its advisor. Anchor Corporation, in a situation where
there was absolutely no investigation whatsoever conducted as
to the propriety of the $20 million investment.
This occurred oven though Anchor was at the time
receiving some $4 million per year for allegedly managing the
portfolio of this, investment fund.
Now, in buying the notes, not only dicl Anchor fail
to conduct any investigation but it failed over the next six
or seven months to be aware of the increasing storm signs and
warnings as to the dismal, failing condition of Penn Central
and failed to even execute a buy-out or a sell-out of the notes
when £t might have.
Moreover, there was an internal guideline in the

46
fund which said that the fund should not purchase commercial
paper of this nature unless it had a commitment that it could
sell it, a so-called “buy-back” commitment,
few, in their reply brief, ray adversary has said
that we have misleadingly asserted that this buy-back provision
was violated because Anchor believed that it had such an under­
standing yet Judge Fuld disagreed.
He stated, at page 113 of the Appendix, accordingly,
"It appears that there was not and that Anchor did not believe
there Was any legal, binding agreement by Goldman, Sachs to
repurchase Penn Central paper.
Therefore, 1 think the ease comes bsfor©

Your

Honors in a situation where you have in my judgment and the
judgment of the Court of Appeals a rather strong showing of
breach of fiduciary duty and. gross abuse of trust in violation
of tha 1940 Act by Anchor and by the directors at the time of
the Mutual Fund,
QUEST!ON:

Now —
Are you suggesting that this was negli­

gence that was sc gross as to rise to the level of a breach of
trust?
MR. EINSTEIN!?
QUESTION*

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I think —

In other words, it was utterly stupid to

do what they did or fail to do *MR. EINSTEIN*
QUESTION *

I think it goes even beyond stupidity.

And that was the basis of your derivative

47
shareholderss action.
MR» EINSTEIN?
QUESTIONs

That is absolutely right, Your Honor»

Which really only tangentially bears on

the issue here»
MR. EINSTEINs

Well, as I will come to in a moment,

1 do think that the merits of the action do very much bear on
the issue here.
Mow, as the Court is aware, there was this lawsuit
brought by feh© Fume against Goldman, Sachs alleging fraud in
this representation at th© time of the purchase»
Now, that suit was settled for slightly over 25 per
cent of the less and I must advise th© Court that: one of the
reasons that motivated the Fund to settle was because it had a
sophisticated advisor and it was worried that if it pressed
the litigation, the effect of its having an allegedly sophisti­
cated advisor might militate against recovery.
Now, even if you take the $5 million that has been
recovered and you ascribe whatever value you want to to these
pieces of paper that have been issued to the Fund, as additional
eettleraent value, there is still a shortfall here; of $10, $12,
$15 million which we believe should be recouped, from Anchor
and from the defendant directors.
How, after the action against Goldman, Sachs was
settled the motion which leads us to this Court today was
interposed by the Defendant.

48
Now, it is significant to note that shortly after
the Penn Central collapsed, the Board of Directors of the Fund
determined to sue Goldman, Sachs,

They also determined to hold

in abeyance any other action against anyone else,
Now, over the years, between that time and 1970 and
1974 when the

dismissal motion was interposed, the Fund's

Board of Directors did change and you composed a five-member
minority of the Board who were independent and unaffiliated
with Anchor.

It was those minority directors who ultimately

determined to seek dismissal of this action.
Now, initially, when the motion was made in the
district court, the district court permitted discovery and it
•appears on page 20 of the Appendix on a very, very limited
plane.
He permitted discovery to pursue the relationship
of the minority directors and the qualifications committee to
determine whehter the minority directors were disinterested or
independent.

That was the sole scope of the discovery allowed

in this action.
Now, it is significant to note that the discovery
permitted did not include any discovery on the merits, did not
include any discovery on the nature and content of the dis­
closures made to Judge Fuld and 2 think that is a significant
area because the disinterested minority director.-: could

on Ly

act based upon information filtered to them through Judge Find

49
■through their special counsel.

That, the disclosures being

made to special counsel were the disclosures of the Defendant
Directors and Anchor Corporation, made not under oath but in
informal discussions.
Now, X think it was important

for the district

judge to have had — and b.@ could not have had in this case —
. .'ah indication of whether the full mix of available information

was supplied to Judge Fuld and through him to the minority

independent directors.

MR. EINSTEINt 1 do not see how anybody on this record

ware fully informed.,

There is nothing in tills record which will

disclose what information was given to the directors and what
information may have been withheld.

MR* EINSTEIN;

The Second Circuit, Your Honor, the

opinion I find somewhat ambivalent on this issue because if
you look at pages 46 and 47 of the Appendix where the -opinion
appears, the Second Circuit clearly discusses the fact that
these directors served not only as directors on this fund's
board but on a number of other boards with funds managed by
Anchor and received $11,000 to $13,000 per annum compensation.

that where a subsequent fact has occurred after the decision

QUESTIONs

excuse me, Mr. Justice White.

The district judge, X suppose,'thought

he was complying with Rule 23?

MR. EINSTEIN:

The district judge rejected the

The question was

briafad in the Seeded Circuit but never reached by the court

because —■

67
QUESTION:

He said that Rule 23 has nothing to do

with it whatsoever.
MR. EINSTEIN:

That is correct, it did not apply.

And the district court and the Second Circuit found it unneces­
sary to reach the question.
How, we also believe, Your Honors, that if you do
not follow the rationale of the Second Circuit and view the
case as one under 23.1 requiring hearing as a prerequisite to
dismissal and when you look at the factors that the Court must
consider, that on this record, especially given the subsequent
termination of Anchor as the Fund's advisor, there is no
.rationale or reasonable basis for dismissal of this action.
The action should be allowed to proceed.

The

allaged harm which the fund perceived it could suffer'by fur­
ther prosecution of this action is no longer existent.
QUESTION:

I do not understand, if we agreed with

• you on 23.1 and the district court, refused to apply it and we
think he should have, why would we not send it hack for him to
apply it?
.v:r, EINSTEIN i

Because whan you look at the factors

that Rule 23.1 requires, Mr. Justice Brennan, consideration of
the merits, the Court of appeals has found there was merit.
The question of independence, th© §ourt of Appeals
questioned that and th® so-called ’’business judgment reason©,K
the reasonableness of the decision particularly, you find that

68
the business judgment reasons no longer exist because ©f the
termination of Anchor.
QUESTION*

But in the first instance, if you are

aright, Section 23.1 contemplatas that it is the district court
who shall make the initial judgment whether 23.1 shall satisfy*
MR. EINSTEIN:

Yes but if you sent it back feo the

district court and the district court refused again to dismiss
and your view of the case today was that it had to be retained,
it could not be dismissed, we would just have an up and down
procedure again without any reason or purpose®
QUESTION:

Well, w© might affirm a judgment that

might not haw® mad® in the first instance ourselves, just
because

it might rest on findings that ar@ clearly erroneous.
MR. EINSTEIN:

That is correct, Your Honor but x

think in this case with the removal of Anchor, the facts are

the footnote?
MR. POLLACK:

21.

Footnote 21 says, "Although we

suggest a remand, this Court could determine reasonableness if
it wishes because that determination involves only 'the applica­
tion of a legal standard to a documentary record.”
How, if this Court can determine reasonableness
from this record, surely Judge Werksr could and we argua,
implicitly did make a finding of reasonableness if this Court
should find that that is necessary.
Therefore, w® come? back to the proposition that
although we believe that state law governs and that that is the

11
test to be applied, that is to sayr the test of good faith, no
matter which of the tests that have been proposed here, we
believe that we meat that test.
Judge Marker foaid — and 1 alt® this to the Court
& 36 — that the minority directors carefully evaluated the
opinions tendered by both corns©!.

They considered the merits.

They discussed the facts and circumstances surrounding the
purchase end retention of the paper and they comatinicat®d @r>t@sasively among themselves before reaching a decision to seek
dismissal of this salt.
1 believe that this is precisely the type of direc­
torial conduct that on® wishes to encourage.
Thank you vary much for your time.•
