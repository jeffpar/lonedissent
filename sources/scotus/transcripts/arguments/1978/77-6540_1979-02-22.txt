MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

We will go out of order, If

we may, unfcil more of our colleagues arrive, and hear first
the case 77-6540, Harold Ramsey versus New York.
Mr. Fisher, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W, FISHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Justice Brennan, and may It please

the Court:
The case involves the practice of plea bargaining
and the voluntariness of a guilty plea.

Its distinguishing

feature is that it presents for review the issue of whether and
to what extent a sitting trial justice pay-participate in the
actual give and take of negotiations for a guilty plea, and it
invites the resolution of a question specifically left open in
Brady v. United States of what the consequences would be if a
judge were to deliberately e-nploy his sentencing power to induce
a defendant to tender a guilty plea by threatening to Impose a
harsher sentence after trial.
Harold Ramsey, the Petitioner, was 24 years old when
he took this plea.

He had a history of emotional problems and

was certainly no stranger to the criminal justice system in
Kings County.

He had been a juvenile delinquent.

He had been

adjudicated a youthful offender and had been convicted of a
felony prior to this involvement with the law.

4
In this ease* he was charged with two separate armed
robberies.

As his case made its way through the courts of

Kings County* he appeared in a conference part which was
specially designated in Kings County for the exploration of
the possibility of disposition without trial.

In that part*

he answered a guilty plea to the reduced charge of unarmed
robbery and did so upon a sentencing promise made by the judge
of an indeterminant term of from three and a half to seven years
incarceration* that being only slightly greater than the very
minimum he could have received under New York law.

Subsequently*

he withdrew that plea and the case was transferred to a trial
part where Mr. Ramsey for the first time encountered the judge
whose conduct is called into question here.
It was eighteen months after he had been arrested
and he had been incarcerated throughout that period of time*
when Mr. Ramsey was afforded a pretrial Wade hearing.

One

\

witness was called.

She identified the Petitioner as the

perpetrator of the armed robbery*quite definitely.

And the

defense tried to raise some issue as to the propriety of pre­
trial identification techniques.

However* the next morning*

prior to the conclusion of that hearing* the defendant*
Mr. Ramsey* offered to plead guilty* this time to the charge of
armed robbery* as charged in the indictment* one count to cover
both indictments* this plea upon a sentencing promise offered
by the judge of an indetenainant term of from six to twelve

5
y ea rs in ca rc era t i on.
There is no transcript of the negotiations that led
to this guilty plea* because*as is the custom in Kings County
and in New York plea* negotiations are generally conducted at
bench conferences and are not recorded.
record.

They are not on the

But we learned about the negotiation and what happened

to lead the Petitioner to plead guilty because immediately prior
to sentence the Petitioner moved on papers supported by his own
affidavit and the affidavit of defense counsel.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fisher* before you continue* you told

us just a moment ago that ordinarily in Kings County plea nego»
fciations are conducted e& bench conferences of which no record
is made.
MR, FISHER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Does that imply that it is quite usual

for judges to participate in the negotiations?
MR® FISHER:

Yes* it does* Your Honor.

In fact* at

oral argument in the Appellate Division below* the District
Attorney quite candidly conceded that this type of negotiation
goes on all the time.
QUESTION:

And your position* I gather* .is that it

is always improper for the judge to -«
MR. FISHER:

I would ask that the Court establish a

procedural safeguard based upon my analysis of Jackson* the
needless encouragement of guilty pleas®

6
I would think that the active participation of a trial
judge in the give and take of negotiations for a guilty plea
encourages a defendant to plead guilty, and it serves no state
interest, therefore, it is needless encouragement.
QUESTION:

To what extent would you suggest the judge

has any role to play?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that an agreement may be

reached between a defense counsel and the prosecutor.

And that

agreement may be presented to the trial judge.
Now, my argument is limited essentially to judges
who are scheduled to preside at trial in the event that no
disposition is reached.
QUESTION:

A judge who will sentence the man if he

pleads guilty and is found -- pleads not guilty but is found
guilty.
*

MR. FIEHER:

That’s correct.

I find no constitu­

tional objection to the conference part concept that is
established in Kings County, where a defendant who may invite
judicial participation can do so knowing that the judge with
whom he is negotiating will not preside at a trial should no
disposition be reached.
It seems to me that the source of the encouragement
to plead guilty is the defendant’s knowledge that a rejection
of a plea offer made by the court,by the judge, will mean a trial
held before this same judge who may view him then as a guilty

7
man who has rejected a fair disposition of his casee
QUESTION:

What if the prosecutor offers to recom­

mend a certain sentence to the defendant if he pleads guilty,
and the defendant says, "How do I know what the judge will do?
Your recommendation isn't binding."

And the prosecutor says,

"Well, If you are agreeable, we can take it to the judge and
we may get some feel for how he thinks about It."
Would you say that's unconstitutional?
MR. Fid HER:

I would not object to the presentation

in the federal system of an agreement being presented to a
judge who then may ratify or reject the offer.

The judge must

act independently in accordance with his own responsibility.
Certainly, his responsibility is to ultimately impose sentence.
So that an independent agreement reached by the prosecutor and
defense counsel cannot bind the judge, and they may present it.
I do not find the same coercive impact In that presentation to
a judge at that time.
QUESTION:
MR.FISHER:

What's the difference?
Well, the first difference that comes to

mind is although — assume that that agreement were rejected
by the judge.

There would be no personal investment in the

plea bargaining procedure by the judge.

There would be no

personal rejection as in the case where a judge, himself, makes
a specific plea offer and the defendant rejects it.

The judge

presumably would make an offer that he would be fair to all

8
sides»

And by a defendant rejecting an offer made by the

court he would then face the possibility that the judge would
resent that rejection and that his resentment might either
intentionally or subconsciously work its way either into a
sentencing function or into the discretionary rulings that he
would make at trial*
QUESTION:

Mr» Fisher* in the State of New York or

in Brooklyn is this by statute* by rule or by what — this
bench conference?
MR,» FISHER:

Well* the conference part

there is

a special part to which cases are sent after arraignment -that is established by court rule»

No statute that I am aware of

in New York —
QUESTION:

But what statute* rule or what says that

i

\

a judge shall participate?
MR» FISHER:
QUESTION:
MR* FISHER:
QUESTION:
MR* FISHER:

There is no statute* rule or other —
It is a custom that has grown up?
It has* Your Honor*
And the judge is a party in this decision?
Yes* and it has been recognized by the

Court of Appeals in our State that judges do participate In
plea negotiations* although some cases have questioned it
referring to the ABA standards which have only last week been
amend ed *
QUESTION:

on which side Is the judge on In

9
the negotiations?
MR* FISHER:

Well* it seems to me that the judge
i

becomes an advocate for a disposition, his own perhaps*
In this ease* this is a good example of where the
prosecutor is taken out of the plea negotiating procedure*
because all the prosecutor did here was prior to the Hade
hearing he said that he would consent to a reduction in charge*
he would consent to a guilty plea to unarmed robbery* his con­
sent being needed under statute.
After the Wade hearing* he withdrew that consent*
but the District Attorney never took any position and indicated
to the court that he would have no position on sentencing.

So

the whole question —
QUESTION;

If one of the parties* the district

attorney* has no position on sentencing* what is the good of
plea bargaining?

Who is doing the bargaining now?

MR* FISHER;

In this particular case and under these

circumstances, the bargaining was between the judge and the
defendant.
QUESTION:

Is that normally understood to be plea

bargaining* or is that a ferial?
MR, FISHER:
County* Your Honor*

It is called plea bargaining in Kings

I must say* though* that there are many

instances In which the prosecutor will make the sentence
recommendation in Kings County and may even condition his

10

consent to a reduction In charge upon the imposition of a
sentence which is agreed to*
So* to that extent* I don't mean to imply that in
all cases in Kings County the prosecutor does not participate.
I simply say that in this case the prosecutor in effect did not
participate except to first give and then withdraw his consent
to the reduction in the charge.
QUESTION;

Mr. Fisher* the ABA standard which you

cite In the footnote on page 16 of your brief* was in fact
changed last week* wasn’t it?
MR* FISHER;

It was* Your Honor.

The proposal that

we cite that was advanced to the ABA was adopted.

It permits*

at the request of both sides* when the defendant and prosecutor
are having difficulty reaching an agreement* they may request
a plea conference* as it were* at which the judge may be the
moderator.

We find difficulties with the part of the

adopted ABA standard which Indicates that the judge may in­
dependently offer a disposition that would be acceptable to
him.
QUESTION;

When you say that the ABA standard permits

what you mean is that it recommends that the states and the
federal government or anybody else who might have sentencing
authority ought to permit the judge* don't you?
MR* FISHER;
QUESTION;

Yes* that is what I mean.
But you would not agree with that if the

11

judge is the one who if the bargaining fails is going to try
the case.
MR* FISHER:
QUESTION:
MR. FXdHER:

That's correct.
Even as a moderator?
I don't think that his position as a

moderator would be consistent with constitutional principles.
Certainly I would have objections to his proposing a disposition
that would be acceptable to him.

I would add» however., that in

the same ABA standards adopted last week it is quite emphatic­
ally said that a judge shall neither by word nor demeanor in­
dicate to a defendant that he believes a plea ought to be
entered.

And it also says that all this negotiation at this

conference shall be conducted on the record.
The problem here is that the plea bargaining was
conducted off the record.
QUESTION*,

Mr. Fisher» one other point.

At this

conference in this case, did they discuss the facts?
MR. FISHER:

Well» it seems established that prior

to the Wade hearing — and generally they do discuss the
fact.

The prosecutor will say» "We think we can prove this,"

And defense counsel may say» "Well» we don't think" —
QUESTION:

do» the judge that is going to try the

case gets a prerun of the case that he is going to later try,
MR0 FISHER:

He does» Your Honor.

And in this case —

12

QUESTION:
MRo FISHER:
QUESTION:

He could get a full run?
He could* Your Honor.
And so the ferial of the case would be a

new ferial ?
MR. FISHER:

It would be.

In this case* Ifc seems

established and uncontested that prior to the Wade hearing
this very ferial judge s.fe apparently an unrecorded bench confer»
ence* again extended to the defendant the plea offer Involving
an unarmed robbery* carrying a three and a half to seven-year
sentence* and that the Petitioner rejected that offer* in»
sisted he was innocent; and requested that he be permitted fco
go to ferial.
What happened then was that the witness testified
at the Wade hearing and fche!.cruclal part of the record* the
clearest account of what happened at that negotiation following
the Wade hearing is given at page 28 of the record* where the
court and defense counsel engage in an exchange where counsel
speaks about what followed the witnesses V testimony,,
He says* very briefly* "There was sane talk about
a plea of guilty and at that time the plea of guilty was
discussed -- talked about as I came up to the bench and we
discussed it.

And Your Honor said that you would give 6 to 12

with the District Attorney's approval.
my client '66 to 12* and he said 'no.v

I came back and said to
And it went back and

forth and finally we arrived at s decision*''

13

And the court interjects about the district attorney
having withdrawn his consent at that time to a charge reduction.
And the lawyer agrees and then goes on:
12 year sentence.

"We arrived at a 6 to

Prior to that time, the admonition or the

statement was made to me that if this guy goes to trial and he
is convicted, he is going to get 12£ to 25,

Your Honor told

me to take that back to my client, which at that time I did,
Judge,

1 gave him that warning,"
And the judge now explains and says, "Subject, of

course, to my reading the probation report, it is the practice
in my court when there is an armed robbery to impose a maximum
sentence, unless there are mitigating circumstances,"

To

which the lawyer replies, "Well, I think, Your Honor, in light
of everything, that that was the basis of why the defendant
took the plea,"
Our position is that this plea in this record was K.
plainly coerced.

We have no quarrel with the proposition

stated as recently by this Court as December, in Corbett v.
Hew Jersey, that a state may, indeed, offer to a defendant
substantial benefit in return for a guilty plea.
And we learned in Bordenklrcher that a prosecutor
may threaten to bring charges, which are justified on the
evidence, in order to induce a defendant to plead guilty,
that on a theory that the prosecutor and the defense arguably
possess equal bargaining power

14

QUESTION:

How about a judge who, at sentencing

after a guilty plea, normally says or announces that "I think
It is only proper to give consideration

to give leniency --

because the person has pled guilty and indicated that he is
ready for rehabilitation or something like that?
MR. FISHER:

I think that might enter a judge's

sentencing decision, but this judge -QUESTION:

Yes, I understand, but — So that a

lawyer may properly advise his client, at least this judge
usually gives leniency,
MR» FISHER:
QUESTION:
MRe FISHER:

Yes, he may.
You don't challenge that practice?
No, I do not challenge that, but I

think that where the Petitioner and Respondent part company
in the content of this case is whether the proposition that a
state may offer substantial benefits to induce or persuade
a defendant to plead guilty, whether that proposition Includes
a trial judge.
We submit that it does not, that the Court must
draw a line at the trial judge.

In the context of a criminal

case, you cannot count a judge as a representative of the state.
His obligation is to stand between the state and the accused,
to Insure that the accused is afforded all protections and
safeguards to which he is entitled under law.

We do not think

that that role is consistent with a judge doing what this judge

15

did here, that is sayings simultaneously, "X will now give you
a sentence of 6 to 12, hut If this guy is convicted, after trial
he will get 12^ to 25,"
QUESTION;

Yet for purposes of state action under

the Fourteenth Amendment, the judge's action is every bit the
action of the state in the same sense as the prosecutor's,
isxi:t it?
MR„ FISHER:

In certain aspects it is, Your Honor,

but I do not believe that in the -- within the confines of the
statement announced in Corbett that a state may offer -- I do
not think that the word "state" in that statement was meant
to include trial judges,

I think it was meant to include

prosecutors who represent the state as the prosecuting body,
not as 'ch'a adjudicating body»

There are different roles,

A

defendant may not oe facea, on the one hand, with a prosecutor
trying to persuade him to give up his Fifth Amendment const!»
tutional right not to plead guilty and tfixfch Amendment right
to go to trial, and then also face the judge who is supposed to
stand between him and the prosecutor,
QUESTION;

I take it then you wouldn't think that

any bargain that's been worked out between the prosecutor and
the defense counsel should be presented for any kind of
approval to the judge who may try the case?
MR, FISHER;

I have no objection to that procedure,

because I do not see, again, the coercion —

16

QUESTION:
agree with it"?

What If the judge says, "No, I don’t

And then he tries the case.,

MR. FISHER:

That might enter -- I think it might

be better practice to go to another Judge, but I don't think
it is constitutionally mandated, because in the event a plea
agreement is reached, it is essential that the plea be pre­
sented — that the agreement be presented to the
QUESTION:

court.

So, what if the trial judge turns it

down and the defendant goes back and says "I'll agree to some­
thing else," and they take it back to the judge and he agrees
to it?
MR. FISHER:

X find nothing wrong with that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

He knows that the judge has simply said

if you don’t go for something better, I am going to try you.
MR. FISHER:

The difference, I think, is when a

judge offers a specific disposition he becomes an advocate for
It and the risk a defendant' faces .is*as rejection of2a
disposition apparently desired by the judge.

When a prosecutor

and defense counsel, on the other hand, agree independently
to a plea bargain, they must -- they have no other alternative
but to present it to the court, to the judge, because the judge
— a guilty plea may only be tendered to the judge.

There Is

no a It err© tive — and to require, in those circumstances, that
a state or federal system mandate that the case be transferred

17

from one judge to another.

And those circumstances may prove*

I thinks too burdensome and would not constitute a needless
encouragement under my analysis.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fisher* you rely* as I understand it*

on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. FISHER:
QUESTION:

I do* Your Honor.
And you contend for a rule that would

never permit the judge to participate in the bargaining itself
to the extent at least that defense counsel said he did in this
case* if that judge is going to be the trial judge.
MR. FISHER:
QUESTION:

Yes* Your Honor.
Is the basis of that submission the

knowledge on the part of the judge that the defendant is
guilty or is it rather the potential resentment and therefore
vindictiveness of the trial judge?
MR. FISHER:

I think »- Nell* the defendant* if he

expresses an interest in pleading guilty and does so to the
judge and the judge is likely to conclude that a defendant who '
is interested in pleading guilty is most likely guilty in fact.
QUESTION:

Of course* judges all the time deal with

the rule that certain evidence should be excluded because of
sometimes for reasons not having to do at all with the guilt or
innocence of the person* very probative evidence of his guilt.
But a judge is required under the law* the Fourt h Amendment
or the rules of involuntary confessions* or whatever* to exclude

18

that from the ferial.

And yet the judge knows all about; it.

Wouldn’t; that give him the idea prefefey clearly that
the defendant is guilty?
MR,» FISHER:

It v*ould and the encouragement to plead

guilty would be precisely the same.

The difference* however*

is that •— I read Jackson as prohibiting fche needless encourage­
ment of guilty pleas.

And while in a suppression case if a

defendant seeks fche suppression of inculpatory evidence* he
must address his suppression motion to the judge who must then
decide it* be it confession or Fourth Amendment question.
Therefore* the judicial participation in that
circumstance* is hardly needless.

It is essential* even though

it may ultimately work some coercive or encouraging effect on
the defendant to plead guilty.
QUESTION:

How about fche situation — Maybe it is

pretty hard for a Brooklyn lawyer to realize this* but there
are many parts of fche United States that are not like Kings
County* that do not have many* many trial judges* that only have
one trial judge,

Many counties in fche United States have only

one trial judge.

Then it would no longer be needless.

It would

be a need* wouldn’t it?
MR, FISHER:

Well* I think not.

I think in that

circumstance* I can see no state interest advanced by the
participation of a trial judge »QUESTION:

But there is only one in the whole county.

19

MR0 FISHER:

Right,

And in that county there would

be no judicial participation in plea bargaining,
QUESTION:

There could not be —

MR, FISHER:
QUESTION:

There could not be under my proposal,
The other way it might come out is to say

that well* in that county* it is not needless.
MR, FISHER:

Except that — That argument might be

made* but I think whoever — .
QUESTION;

But you don’t make it?

MR, FISHER:

That's right.

And I think that it

■would be up to whoever proposed that argument to demonstrate
what that need is.
QUESTION:
pleas,"

You used the phrase "needless guilty

I am not sure I know what you mean by that.
MR. FISHER:

My reasoning is based on what I see to

be the underlying principle in the Jackson case* which is that
the Constitution

•

QUESTION:

What do you think it means?

That's what

I am trying to get at,
MR. FISHER:

What do I think it means?

I think

that what Jackson holds is that some encouragement or encourage
menfc to a defendant to plead guilty is not always violative of
<3ue process.

But the test of Jackson is whether that encourage

menfc is needless* that is whether it serves a legitimate goal
and. whether or not that goal can be achieved by some other

20

means.

And I think in this case the participation of a trial

judge in plea bargaining serves no state interest, and there­
fore is needless., and it encourages a defendant to plead guilty,
Therefore* it is needless encouragement and is barred under the
principle of Jackson,
QUESTION:

What if a judge who is assigned to a district

where he is not regularly sitting* so that his habits are not
known., announces at the beginning of the term* when they call the
criminal calendar* that all persons who are tried and found
guilty will get the maximum sentence permitted by the statute?
Do you think that has a tendency to encourage guilty pleas by
people who make a judgment that they are likely to be found
guilty?
MR, FISHER:
QUESTION:
MR, FISHER:
QUESTION:
MR, FISHER:

Absolutely,
Do you think that is bad?
Yes* I do,
Do you think Jackson prohibits it?
I think the principles of Jackson

prohibit it.
I think there is a case that we cited In our reply
brief called* 1 think* it is United States v, McCoy* where the
Circuit Court* P,C, Circuit*question is presented precisely
with a judge who announces that his policy is to impose a
maximum sentence upon anyone convicted after trial of armed
robbery

21
QUESTION:

Whafc if* instead of announcing it, a

particular judge», by long habit, communicates to the entire bar
practicing In that court that that's what in fact he does, but
he doesn’t articulate that as his standard?
MRa Flo HER:
QUESTION:

That’s a closer question.
Why?

MRe FluHER:

Because there is a difference between

a lawj^er saying to his client, "This judge is reputed to have
a policy of imposing the maximum," — the difference between
that and a judge announcing in open court to a defendant, leaving
no room for doubt or hope, "Yes, I have that policy.

You will

get the maximum if you are convicted®"
QUESTION:

Don't you think there are any advantages

to the category of defendants as a class, persons charged, that
the candor of the judge gives them a much better working basis
for making a decision?
Your Honor, I agree with what I think

MR® FISHER:

is the consensus of opinion in the commentaries in the cases,
that whatever benefit may accrue to defendants as a class with
this increase of information, as they say, is outweighed by the
coercive effect of a judge's announcement or judge's participa­
tion in plea bargaining.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fisher, close to 20 years, more than

15 years ago, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
reversed a conviction on the ground of a statement of a trial

22
judge in Chicago that it was his practice and policy and con»
sidered habit to always give greater sentences to somebody who
had pleaded not guilty and had been found guilty than to those
who pleaded guilty.
Are you familiar with that decision?

I can't re­

member it.
MR* FISHER:
QUESTION;

I am not familiar*
What would you think of ifc?

MR* FISHER:

I would have trouble with it.

The

whole concept of differential sentencing is troublesome* It is
true* as Mr* Justice White suggests, a judge may take into
account a defendants willingness to admit his guilt, to take
the first step on the road towards rehabilitation, but an
announced policy of differential sentencing, I think, would run
into the same problem that we find in this case, and I think -QUESTION;

Although in your case you have,at least

according to the defense counsel, active participation in the
bargaining by the judge himself, and a precise statement in
your case that if found guilty after a non-guilty plea, he
would get the maximum sentence,
MR* FISHER:
QUESTION;

Which is twice
There is a problem in this case as to

what the facts actually are*

All we have is that statement of

defense counsel*
MR, FIEHER;

There are differening interpretations

23

now offered fco the Court by the Petitioner and Respondent.
It seams to me that the Respondent has suggested in
a footnote of his briefs as I pointed out in my reply, that If
the sequence of events occurred as I read the record to show,
that I may very well be entitled to the relief I seek»
Therefore, it seems to me that tacitly, at least,
he has conceded that an evidentiary hearing, to establish which
of the interpretations occurred, is required»
QUESTION:

The colloquy to which you called our

attention on page 28 of the Appendix — most of the support for
your factual position comes from Mr. Bavanzino, who is tr3.al
counsel for the defense.
MR. F28HER: Yes.
QUESTION:

There is some qualified confirmation of

it by the judge, but he Immediately qualifies it.
MR. P18HER:

Well, subject to his reading-of

the probation report is not, I don't believe, very meaningful,
since in New York every court is obliged by law, every judge
*

is obliged by law prior to imposing sentence to at least order
and consider a probation report.
QUESTION:

But then he said, "It is the practice in

my.court when there is an armed robbery to give a maximum
sentence, unless there are mitigating circumstances."
\

MR. FISHER:

Well, he has obviously misrepresented

his position, because this defendant has pleaded guilty to

24

armed robbery and received less than half the maximum sentence
So* what he really meant was that anyone convicted
in his court —
QUESTION:
MR0 FISHER:

After a not guilty plea.
«“ after a not guilty plea.

Thank you* very much.
QUESTION:

Why didn't they have these statements or

negotiations transcribed?
MR. FISHER:

You say they never do it?

It is my experience that that is not -

It is the custom
QUESTION:

Is there a reason for It?

I mean in the

middle of a criminal trials when you have a bar conference*
side bar conference* isn't that transcribed?
MR. FISHER:

In the middle of a criminal trial*

certainly* when issues of law are raised* but not -»
QUESTION:
MR. FISHER:

Why couldn't you do it then?
You certainly could.

I think that it

must be — any negotiations* I think* the better practice is
to transcribe it.

It is simply not the custom in Kings County

to do so.
QUESTION:
r^c

MR. FISHER:

In some counties it is.

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Mischel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD ELLIOT MISCHEL# ESQ.,
'

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR, MISCHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
Before I respond to Petitioner's arguments with
regard to the constitutional propriety of judicial participation
in plea negotiations# I would like to clear up what I perceive
to have been a misconception -- not a misrepresentation# but
a misconception — of what the conference part in Kings County
is all about.
The conference part is not statutorily mandated.
There is no provision for it anywhere in the Neiv York Criminal
Procedure Law,

However# the court rules enacted by the various

appellate divisions of the State of New York have established
a separate and distinct conference part# whereby after a defen­
dant has been indicted#his case will be sent to the conference
part for discussion concerning a disposition before a plea.
Present at this discussion are defense counsel#
the prosecutor# not necessarily the defendant•
his presence -r and the judge.

he.may waive

At that time# the prosecutor

presents the Information he lias with regard to the case# the
defense attorney responds with regard to defenses or any other
matter that he would like to bring before the judge# and at
that time the judge# after evaluating the entire record by

28

reading the grand jury minutes* listening to both sides*
advises the defense attorney of what he would consider to be
a favorable or permissible disposition of this case.
As counsel has pointed out* most of these negotiations*
in fact* all of these negotiations do not appear on the record.
But this is not necessarily a detriment to the plea bargaining
system in Kings County because if there is any question cer«
tainly defense counsel and the court may go on the record and
■spread out* as in this case* their understanding of what the
plea agreement was all about,
1 have suggested in my brief that due process would
be satisfied if a trial judge participated* if during the
negotiations everything is spread out on the record.

But that

does not necessarily preclude or require* for that matter* that
the negotiations be taken down step by step,
I see nothing constitutionally wrong with a situation
in which at the conclusion of the discussions the prosecutor*
defense counsel and the judge spell out the agreement and the
terms of the agreement as they understood them to be.
Certainly* under those circumstances* particularly
where a defense counsel*mayba

looking towards a claim of

prejudicial conduct or coercion*would be expected to Indicate
what he believed to be the coercive aspects of this plea
negotiation
Secondly* I would like to point out that it was

29

raised during oral argument, during Petitioner's argument that
a suppression hearing is markedly different, because the sup­
pression motion must be addressed to a particular judge, therefore establishing the strict necessity which he perceives under
United States v. Jackson,
But the easy answer to that Is that in addition to
all of the prejudicial information which is brought out at the
suppression hearing, at which time the judge may suppress
evidence which conclusively establishes the guilt of the defen.

What he seems

^

to be saying is then that you have to have the suppression motion
directed to the particular judge because the motion must be made
to the judge*

But on the other hand, a court can just as

easily set up a suppression part where the trial judge, or
suppression judge, hears all suppression motions and then
after the disposition is reached the case may be sent back to
the trial judge.
With regard to the American Bar Association stan­
dards, .1 think it is interesting to note that not only do they
recommend an increased participation of the trial t judge, pr r
v.

for that matter any judge, in which the judge may suggest to
the defendant, completely unsolicited, xvhat he would consider to
be a favorable disposition*

But, if in addition to that, the

American Bar Association specifically rejected a proposal which
would require the disqualification of the judge on motion of
the defendant , as a predicate for that motion It must ?be
established that the judge had been exposed to prejudicial
information in the presentence report®
Even the American Bar Association which in 1968
recommended no judicial participation in the plea negotiations,
has now said a judge may only be disqualified if exposed to an
unfavorable presentence report,

MR. MISCHEL:

The Wade hearing was transcribed, but

my understanding of the record was that first the case was

a plea to robbery in the second degree and a term of

He

Then defense counsel

went back to the defendant and the defendant said* "I don't

to suppress identification testimony.

Then he made his motion
Identification witness

identifies the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime* and
unsolicited says* "I wouldn't forget that man's face for 20

At the conclusion of that hearing* and that's all
the testimony we have* we have to assume that the entire pro­
ceeding was transcribed.
Petitioner certainly doesn't allege that there were
any other witnesses.
At that time or the next day* the District Attorney*

certainly not unusual to the County of Kings,
The judge., knowing that the District Attorney would
only accept a robbery one plea, which is required by state
law <*>*» it requires the concurrence of both the judge and the
district attorney — The judge says, "Based on what I have
seen, It is certainly legitimate,

is my practice in these cases — armed robbery cases — I
impose sentences, the maximum sentence, which in your case
would be 12|- to 25 years, subject, of course to any mitigating
factors in his probation report -- "
QUESTION:

Guilty until you are proven innocent?

MR, MISCHBL:

No, Your Honor,

What I think the

judge is saying is, he is not saying to the defendant, "I am
going to penalize you because you are going to trial,"

What

he Is saying to the defendant is "Look, this is my practice.
It is a matter of sentencing discretion,

I find that armed

robberies in Kings County are particularly dangerous.

They

pose a particular danger to the safety of the people.

I have

decided, in my discretion, that aimed robbers should be penalised
more severely than other criminals because of that danger."
In short, he is saying, "If you go to trial —"

is that I think that if Petitioner's facts are borne out in the
record* that the judge said unequivocally* "Take this back to
your client* if he doesn't like

the 6 to 12.

If he goes to

trial and he is convicted* I am

going to give him 12-jr to 25."

Under no authority of this Court.

It is my understanding that the Petitioner would have the
burden of establishing what went on.

Doesn’t Petitioner have the burden right

now, :Ln this Court, of establishing the correctness of his

41

MR. MISCHEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Mr. Mischel, you told us, I think, that

on the part of the trial judge in the plea bargaining.
told us that, didn’t you?
MR. MISCHEL:

You

Some.
The participation — I'd like to

classify —
QUESTION:

And you further told us, unless I mis­

understood you or misheard you, that if the Petitioner's
counsel is correct in his constitutional claim that the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits any
participation of the trial judge in plea bargaining, then you
lose?
MR, MISCHEL:

That is correct, and there would be

no need for a hearing, because his participation -- He
certainly was actively engaged, but I think there are dis­
tinctions that must be drawn.

I think that a judge who says,

"Look, you go to trial or if you take a plea of guilty now, I
will offer you 6 to 12, but if you go to trial and you are
convicted, I will afford you every consideration that I afford
every other defendant who is convicted before my court, and I
will sentence you according to the valid exercise of my sen­
tencing prerogatives." I have a lot of difficulty understanding
how the trial judge in that case then becomes an adversary or
a prosecutor

42

QUESTION:

How does this case fit with Santa Bello?

I am sure you know that»
MR* MISCHEL:

Well# Your Honor, in Santa Bello, it

was a promise by a prosecutor which the defendant then relied
upon, and then the court refused to honor*
Excuse me, that the prosecutor then reneged on
his promise, but I think there is a very clear distinction
between the conduct of a prosecutor and how far we would permit
a prosecutor to go, as opposed to a trial judge*
For example, in my own opinion, I don't think that
a judge could threaten the kind of treatment that the prosecutor
in Bordenklroher threatened.

Because under those circumstances

a defendant has no alternative but to believe that the trial
judge, because of his conduct, is now the prosecutor.

And now

he has got to go into court and not only fight the evidence of
the prosecutor, but he’s got to fight a hostile trial judge.
QUESTION:

You puzzle me by something you said*

You said that assuming the unfavorable version of the facts,
from your point of view, that you kind of acknowledge that as
a due process violation*
MR* MISCHEL:
QUESTION:

Yes, I would. Your Honor.

Well, how does the case, as you assume

it to be, differ from the one the Chief Justice posed a little
while ago where the trial judge just announces his policy is
always to impose the maximum?

Is that equally bad?

MR. MISCHEL:

I would submit. Your Honor, that 1

would have difficulty with an announced policy that anybody who
is convicted in my court would only be sentenced to the maximum,
because at that point you are taking out what sentencing re­
quires, that is flexibility and —
QUESTION:

Supposing the judge just says, "My

practice in cases of this kind is to give 17 years."
MR. MISCHEL:

I still think that the judge, under

those circumstances, wou3d be imposing a penalty, because it
is not based on any fact —
QUESTION:

Supposing he always does it, and then

take it one step further, as the Chief Justice did earlier]
he just does it, every draft case, the man gets three years
or every tax evasion case, two years, and all the bar knows it.
What's the difference between that and the judge saying, "This
is a policy I think I'll follow," and anybody ought to know it.
Of course, there are exceptions when there are strong mitigating
circumstances.
How do you differentiate?

And why isn't it better

for the defendant to really know what the judge intends to do?
MR. MISCHEL:

I think that is wrong that prior to

trial, before a judge has had any information given to him
about a particular case, with particular facts and circumstances

QUESTION:

Well, he says, "My practice is," and it

44
is always subject- to exceptions, which I think he said here*
didn't he?
MR® M3BCHEL:

Then I misunderstood®

When he is

saying that it is always subject to exceptions or subject to
mitigating factors, at that point, he is willing to take into
account the fact that this is an individual and this person
should be sentenced according —>
QUESTION:

Didn’t this judge do that?

MR. MISCHEL:
judge did.

That is correct.

That is what our

And I am saying that that was fine, but what

Mr. Fisher is arguing is that it was a two-step process.

He

didn’t say if convicted and subject to the mitigating factors.
Under Mr® Fisher’s view of the facts, the judge first offered
a 6 to 126

Defense counsel went back, spoke to the defendant

and the defendant said, "I want to go to trial®

I am not

pleading guilty and finish with it.”
Trial counsel went back to the bench and said, "Your
Honor, he doesn’t want the plea."

At which point, according

to Petitioner, the trial judge said, "Well, if he doesn’t like
that, take this back to him:

If he is convicted, I am going to

give him 12| to 25.”
According to Petitioner, the statement about the
practice, the statement about the probation report ivas merely
an after thought or window dressing brought up at the time of
the sentencing, which was six weeks after the plea.

That’s what

45
we perceive to be the distinction.

Because under Mr, Fisher's

factss under Petitioner’s facts, the judge is really dis­
regarding his sentencing discretion and saying, "Look, I will
give you -- based on what I know now, I will give you one
sentence.

If you go to trial, I will give you another sen­

tence,"
Under those circumstances, Your Honor, I believe
that he is being penalized for asserting his rights, and that
type of case would come under the mandate of Jackson.
a judge says, "I will treat you like everybody else.

But where
You will

be sentenced according to the valid exercise of my sentencing
prerogative," a defendant is not being penalized for going to
trial,
QUESTION:

Is there no distinction in that

Jackson involved a death penalty, did it not?
MR. MISCHEL:
QUESTION:

Yes, it did. Your Honor.

Do you think there might be one rule

about a case as Jackson is, relating to the specter of a
death sentence, and that it would not be necessary to apply
that same concept to the matter of two or three years more or
less?
MR. MISCHEL:

Your Honor, in Brady v. United States;

Mr* Justice Brennan pointed out, specifically, in his opinion
in Parker v. North Carolina, that one of the big considerations
in the Jackson case was the death penalty, and until Corbett

46
was handed down* I had assumed that that was probably the
primary motivating factor.

After reading Corbett* my under­

standing of the law is that where a statutory scheme is set
up which automatically subjects an Individual to a penalty.-that doesn't mean he has to get it — but automatically subjects
him to a penalty x^hlch would not be available if he pleaded
guilty* that would come under Jackson and would violate due
process.

In other words* a statute would say "defendant on

armed robbery cases gets 15 years.
automatically gets 7 years."

If he pleads guilty* he

I would have difficulty with that

situation,
QUESTION:

What about Corbett* the situation in

Corbett?
Mr. MISCHBL:

in Corbett* Your Honor* the defendant*

whether or not he pleaded non volt or went to trial* was
subject to the same type of penalty.

If he pleaded non volt*

Your Honor* the trial —
QUESTION:

But if he went to trial* there was no way

he could — and was found guilty — there was no way he'd get
a lesser sentence than the statute stated.
MR. MLSCHEL:
QUESTION:

That is correct* Your Honor* but —

So* it was a flat rule* if you go to

trial you have a certain penalty.
MR. MXSCHEL:

My understanding in Corbett* Your

4

Honor — and I

be mistaken — was that if you went to trial

47
and the jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree,
he got a definite sentence.
QUESTION:

If he pleaded non* volt, he —

He could get less.

MR. MISCHEL-

He could, but the point is that he

could also be subject to the same penalty.
penalize him for the same thing.

The judge could

And there vias no discrimination

or discrepancy between the two situations.

In fact, In Jackson

the opinion pointed out that if the jury could find him guilty
and penalize him —
QUESTION:

So what if the trial judge says, "Look,

if you go to trial — there isn't any statute — if you go to
trial you are going to get X — armed robbery I always give
30 years; that’s just the way it is.
I may give you less.

But if you plead guilty,

I could give you 30 years, but I may give

you less,"
Now, you have just said that is unconstitutional.
The only difference between what I just said and Corbett; is
that the 30 years is in the statute.
MR. MISCHEL:
QUESTION:

Which one are you going to retreat on?

MR. MISCHEL:
QUESTION:

I'd have to retreat on that.

I think that when a trial judge —

You don’t need to answer right now, if

you don’t want to.
MR, MISCHEL:

If 1 may articulate .it,,

a trial judge — I'll take a step back,

I think that

It certainly — There

48
is no question that a trial judge is going to impose sentence*
It Is no secret, number two, that when a trial judge imposes
a sentence that if a defendant pleads guilty he will definitely,
or in most cases, receive a more lenient sentence.

And the

state is certainly encouraged, either through the trial judge,
prosecutor or the legislature to encourage the taking of pleas
by the offering of substantial benefits,
But I think that when a judge announces before trial,
without considering the facts and circumstances of the case,
without knowing anything about
QUESTION:

In Corbett, the legislature had announced

before all trials that for certain crimes there is a mandatory
penalty,
MR, MISCHEL:

I understand that, but I think the

difference between the legislature, Your Honor, and a trial
judge was succinctly pointed out by Mr, Justice Brennan in
Parker v,.North Carolina, at Footnote 8, where he said that
there is a distinction, a human distinction, between a statute
which is rigidly implied and a judge who can be approached and
any evidence of overbearing or overreaching will appear on the
record,

I think that when a judge goes on the record and

says, "This is what I am going to do to you,” under certain
circumstances that can only be construed as a threat*

A

statute is a neutral, across-the-board type of application*
A judge, on the other hand, may, through his rulings, as

49
Petitioner points out* through his personality, influence the
conduct of the trial, which may not be — I would hesitate to
say this — but may not be readily apparent in a record of
trial c
QUESTION:

What if the prosecutor says, "If you go

to trial, my recommendation to the trial judge is always 30
years if he is found guilty"?
MR. MISCHEL:
QUESTION;

I am sorry, Your Honor„

’What if the prosecutor says, "If you go

to trial on armed robbery and are found guilty, I’ll always
recommend 30 years, without exception, but I am certainly
willing to plea bargain, if you want to"?
MR0 MISCHEL:

Your Honor, that would seem to cane

under Bordenklrcher, and I still maintain that there is a
very definite distinction between the prosecutor’s threat
to recommend a sentence and a judge’s threat to impose a
sentence; because
QUESTION:
J*

Because he’s got the power to withhold

G»

MR* MISCHEL;

That is correct. Your Honor.

And

by threatening to impose the sentence, based on nothing more
than defendant's assertion of his right to go to trial, I think
that at that point the defendant can only assume that the trial
judge has become, in fact, a prosecutor, and is no longer that
detached neutral magistrate which we've all heard so much about.

QUESTION:

Mr. Misehel, before you go on, you and

your friend, too, have referred from time to time to the
American Bar Association reports that cover this area, several
of them.

In light of the rather sweeping concessions you seem

to have made, I wonder if you are aware that in every one of
those reports the American Bar pointedly said they were not
addressing constitutional questions, but merely good sound
practice.

None of those were suggesting a constitutional

question in this problem.
MR. MI3CHEL:

Are you aware of that?
Yes, I am. Your Honor, and I would

only suggest that the American Bar Association, while they
are not considering the constitutional ramifications of what
they are doing,certainly would not suggest that the practices
that they advocate would also run counter to the Constitution.
My problem with sentencing in this particular case
Is that when a judge, without regard to any factors, other
than the fact that an individual —
QUESTION:

I was approaching this from the —

I was making the observation from quite the other end of the
spectrum, namely, that even when they recommended something
was a desirable practice, they expressly disclaimed any notion
that failure to follow that desirable practice would be a
violation of the Constitution.
MR® MISCHBL:

Your Honor, I understand that to be

correct, and in addition the proposals of the American Bar

Association or the standards certainly would not be required
in the states, and the state would be able to adopt a system
contrary to that*

I think that the system in Kings County

fully comports with due process,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted„
(Whereupon, at 11:29 o'clock, a.m., the case was
submitted«)
