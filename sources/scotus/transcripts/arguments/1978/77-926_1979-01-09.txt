PROCEEDINGS

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Is will hear arguments

next in 77-92S, Cannon against University of Chicago and others
Mr. Cannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. CANNON, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents as a matter of first impression
the issue of whether Title IX of the education amendments of
1972 may be enforced in a federal civil action.
The. particular ease involves an application to
medical .school which was allegedly denied on the basis of sex.
Title IX provides in pertinent part:

"No person

in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded
from any. education program receiving federal financial
assistance."
At. bedrock, this case asks the question, in the
words of this Court from Allen v. State Board of Elections
whether that sweeping promise

of Congress is to be merely an

empty promise.
The current operating plan of the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfarefs Office for Civil Rights
contemplates a predicted backlog of 3,570 civil rights
complaints, including 889 which include allegations ©f sex

4
discrimination.
Title IX applies to approximately 37,000 institutions.
The number of participants, according to HEW, is approximately
55 million.
As of September 30, 1976, HEW had asked 20,318
school districts and collages to file compliance statements.
By the following Marsh, 1377, only 6,742 had done so.
The enforcement task is enormous; much more enormous
than that faced by the Attorney General with respect to election
laws and considered by this Court in the Allen ease.
In fact, HEW has declared itself it has no heps of
making a complete enforcement job for this spread of concern.
Now HEW in its fcriof to me made the most significant
point of any of the briefs, including our own.

And that is

that Congress clearly contemplated that voluntary compliance
would be the primary means for enforcement, not only ©£ Title
IX, but of its predecessor legislation, Title VI, and subs®quenfc legislation dealing with handicapped and age discrimination.
QUESTION:

If HEW sees a violation here, d© yon have

any hypothesis to suggest why HEW has not proceeded fee enforce
the statute, as you construe the statute?
MR. CANNON:

Yes,

vl -«• two things.

i'

Obviously there

was sows confusion between the District :V office la Chicago
and the national office.

The national office, in the opinion
i

-f:

which is attached to the petition for certiorari» has long

4

5

maintained the position* and particularly with respect to Title
IX since September of 1974s that there is a private right ©£
action to enforce Title XX? whereas the district office went
into the Federal District Court and denied the existence ©f
the private right of action* and said they were proceeding.
And indeed there is* in the appendix* a copy of my
correspondence with the United States Attorney in Chicago that
indicated the regional director planned to conduct this
particular investigation during the first half of January* 1975,
QUESTION:

Would you agree that Congress has given

HEW a lethal weapon to deal with these problems?
MR. CANNON:

Quite frankly* Your Honor, the Carnegie

Foundation characterized it as the atomic bomb.

2 think it°s

perhaps too lethal in the sense that we referred in ©ur reply
brief to going through the fund cutoff procedures with HEW
as playing Russian roulette with an institution.
Too many of our wonderful institutions ©£ higher
learning, and other federally-assisted organizations, are
dependent for anything like their current mode ©f operations
on Federal funds.
Putting the federal funds at risk is one thing that
can be avoided by judicial action.

And HEW has pointed that

out
QUESTION:

Well, Congress -*» you're making a very

good argument that Congress should have affirmatively, clsarly,

©

and unequivocally provided for a private action as an
alternative.
But is that an argument that x*?e should woigh?
MR. CANNON:

Well, in considering why they may not

have done that, I would point out that legislating in that
particular area gets vary touchy, particular with the background'
being Title VI.
And consider the fact that this Court probably would
not have tolerated

and Congress was quite well aware that it

would not tolerate «»*=* a reverse of that provision0

And

historically, there has not beon an express authorisation for
federal jurisdiction to remedy what is at bedrock constitutional
violations by federal authorities.
And in this case, as well as Title VI, it's the
utilisation of federal funds to support discriminatory activity
which may well be *»*» and in many cases was clearly recognised
as

11

m

IbP'-IIBI /1 . jHp| 11

constitutional violations„

So that the absence of a provision is not really new.
In fact, the greatest powers of this Court, tracing back in the
?
private right of action to some recent eases with Bibbins and
■

Bell v. Hood.
But more deeply, through Marbury, and all the way
back to the King's bench, that -» where there’s a legal right
provided, unless there’s a legal remedy, it’s not much ©£ a
right.

1

And that, of course, Is our basis question:
an empty promise, or will it he enforced?

Is this

And for the present,

it simply must be enforced by the courts or it°s not going t®
be enforced at all.
HEW, the one to do the enforcing, has told us

00»

And

the facts are quite clear.
Moreover, even if HEW could conceivably somehow get'
around to this enormous number of cases, the regulations that
they have promulgated, and by the time Title IX came and
followed with the other legislation, these

regulations war©

in existence and known to Congress0
QUESTION:
suppose?

How many ©f them are there, do y@«

How many cases are you talking about?
MRo CANNONs

Casas, the current predicted backload

on the civil rights area for Office of Civil Rights is the
3,570 predicted as of this October, with 889 involving
allegations of sax discriminatione
QUESTION:

So if you’re talking about private enforce*»

ment, 1 suppose you9 re talking about the possibilities of that
many cases, plus a lot of others, that would never get into th©
HEW AT all?
MR. CANNON:

Right.

55 million participants figure

of the extreme potential.
QUESTION:
MR, CANNONi

We could easily handle those.
Not at all.

It is the immediacy ©£ feh©

judicial action,, as HEW pointed out»
Many institutions, like all ©f us* would like t© g©
©n our way and not considor sonte — and be accused of a
violation of civil rights„

lt6s not a pleasant thing t©

contemplate.
But to take it seriously, and provide meaningful internal
procedures, immediate outside enforcement by an independent
agency, be it a court or HEW, is not necessary, at least for
this time, unless the Court can step in and provide immediate
supervision, there cannot be enforcement of the sweeping
language of Congress»
And when the Court considers the fundamental rights
that are covered by that promise, we would suggest to the
Court that neither the judiciary nor the executive nor the
Congress itself has any more important business than the
enforcing the social justice among our own cifcisens»
QUESTION:

Now you've spoken of these numbers,

55 million figure of course is pretty staggering, but the
3,500'

isn’t all that staggering»

It’s roughly 100 eases per

district, federal district? although they would not be evenly
spread, of course.
Did I say 100?
per district.

I meant to say 300.

about 300 eases

That's just a little bit over the caseload for

on© district judge, average caseload figures.
So it isn't quits as staggering as the 55 million

potential, is it?
MR. CANNON:

Absolutely.

And it9s really -- as HEW

pointed out in their brief, the availability of the judicial
remedy that is going to lead to meaningful internal compliance
procedures.
And whether one views the procedure as primarily
aimed at providing outside judgment on the internal affairs,
and any judicial review being de novo, or under a standard of
clearly wrong, or other such standard, the importance is its
immediacy.
A district judge, just like an agency, is going to be
influenced by the quality of the internal investigation, the
internal record that's made on considering the matters at
issue„
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. MeCREE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS,
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
The government’s position in this matter is
essentially that presented by my brother a few moments ago;
That we have a statute that requires the construction of this
Court to determine whether it was — whether it affords a
private remedy against a private party that is a recipient of

Io
federal funds in the education area.
We argue that three years before this statute was
enacted^ namely, in 1969, in Allen v. State Board of Elections,
this Court was confronted with the necessity of construing a
similar statute.
That statute provided, no person shall be denied
the right to vote for failure to comply with a newly covered
enactment that the statute consisted of.
That, of course, required the pre-clearance of
changes in election laws.

And there was an elaborate scheme

of enforcement, which ultimately required the Attorney General
to bring an action with a restrictive venue to the

District

of Columbia to see whether the election change required preclearances to see that it didn’t offend the objectives of the
statute,
Nov?, in a case with as complicated an administrative
procedure for enforcement, even requiring the bringing of the
action by the Attorney General in a particular venue, this
Court nevertheless, looking at the language — no person

shall,

be denied the right to vote for failure to comply — found
an intent on the part of Congress not only to create a private
right in an individual, but also to afford him a remedy in the
federal courts,
QUESTION:

General McCree, what do you suppose would

be the basis of federal jurisdiction such as this against the

11
University of Chicago where you don9t have any state action?
GENERAL McCREEs

The funding, the federal funding, of

the agency, 1 believe the federal government has the — the
Congress has the authority to determine how its funding will be
expended by a recipient»
QUESTION'

No doubt of that»

But what's the

statutory provision that would confer jurisdiction on the
federal court?
I would suppose 1343 would do it in the case of a
state university, but what about a private university?
GENERAL McCREEs
restricted to a state

Well, 1343, Section 4/which isn't

■ or action under the color of a state

right -- would be the jurisdictional basis for it.

And if

Title .LX was found to create a private cause of action, 1343,
Section 4, would afford jurisdiction for a federal court to
entertain it.
And that's the crux of our argument that Section 9
does create a private cause of action against a private
recipient of federal funds,

And if it does jurisdiction lies,

and the court should have heard the matter,
QUESTION s

How about 13 31?

GENERAL McCREEs
question statute.
QUESTIONS

Well, 1331 is the general federal

And 1331
$10,000 or-

GENERAL McCREEs

more ~

-- jurisdictional amount.

And

12
1334 has been construed as — as not requiring it,.so we would
look at that.
Whether Mrs, Cannon would have — could show the
jurisdictional amount is problematic.

She didn't attempt to.

Her action is clearly under 1343, Section 4,
QUESTIONS

But you think Title IX would be construed

to be a civil rights statute?
GENERAL MeCREE s

I would say Title IX clearly should

be construed to be a civil rights statute,
As a matter of fact the legislative history

indicates

that Title IX was originally contemplated as an amendment to
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but later was enacted as part
of the education amendments of 1972,
But its clear language that no person

'shall, on

the basis of sex, be denied participation or be — or be
denied the benefits of or be discriminated against in any
federally financed education program — clearly is the
kind of language the Congress has used when it has intended to
confer a private right of action to remedy a deprivation of
civil rights,
Senator Birch Bayh, who was the sponser of Title IX
in the Senate, clearly stated that the purpose of Title IX
was to eradicate the years of discrimination against, particu­
larly, women, but it wasn't limited to women, persons, ©n the
basis of sex.

13
So I think 1343; 3, would certainly — its require­
ment of it being a civil rights statute would certainly be
satisfied»
QUESTIONS

You meant 4, not 3»

GENERAL MeCREE:

34, I beg your pardon»

Thank you

for correcting me, Your Honor»
We submit that the Congress, on the basis of the
construction given to language which commences, no person
shall be denied a specific right, has reason to, and dees in
fact utilise that language when it intends to create a private
right and to create a private remedy»
We suggest that because in a series.of civil rights
acts, whenever Congress has intended there not to ba a private
right of action, it has expressly stated that the administrative
remedy will be exclusive.
QUESTION:

And yet some other sections of the Civil

Rights Act, when they wanted a private cause of: action, they
provided for it»
GENERAL MeCREE:
please..,

That is correct, if the Court

But it is done so for a specific purpose of showing

a limitation on the privat® cause of action that was' created»
For example, in Title II of the Civil Rights Act ©f
1964, concerned with public accommodations, there was the
express grant of a private action, but it was specifically
limited and restricted.

14
Similarly, in Title VII, which was the equal
employment opportunities part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
there was the express grant of a private act, but specifically
limited to require the utilisation of state facilities for
processing claims of this sort, and then subsequently, the
federal agency that was sat up and requiring certain time
limits to be followed,
QUESTIONS

You think that if Congress had expressly

provided for a private cause of action under this section, it
wouldn't have limited it or conditioned it upon exhausting
administrative remedies, or anything like that?
GENERAL McCREEs

I can only suggest that the Congress

did not do so, and when it enacted Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, it also did not do so.
And of course Title VI —
QUESTION?

That's somewhat of a bootstrap.

GENERAL McCREE:

It may very well be, but the

Congress has & clear pattern of using the language ~~
QUESTIONs

Yeah, it may be clear one way or the other.

GENERAL McCREEs

I think that's sc.

I think that

explains why we're here today this morning.
But the Congress apparently has relied upon this
language formula to create a private cause of action when it
intends to do this.
On the other hand, the Congress has used other

15
kinds of

language formulae when it'has not intended to do it.

For example, the Congress should have ~ could have said, no
educational institution shall — or any educational institution
that discriminates on the basis of sex will not receive
federal funds.
And in such an instance, I would be hard put to argue
that someone who felt discriminated against could find from
that & private right created, and a federal remedy to vindicate
that right„
But here the language consistently runs through the
series of civil rights actions which are intended t© remedy
against discrimination on th© basis of race, on the basis of
sex, on the basis of age, on the basis of physical handicapse
This language, no person shall be discriminated against.
.And when it intended to give a restrictive right of
action, it so expressed itself, as it did in Title XX and Title
VII, when it intended to have no private cause of action,
despite the use of that language.

It has expressly stated

that the administrative remedy will be exclusive, as it did
in Title III of the older American amendments ©f 1975.
But when it did neither, it appears that the Congress
intended then for the recipient of this right to be afforded a
federal remedy.
QUESTIONt

Mr. Solicitor General, what import, if

any, do you attach to Senator Keating8s inability to get a

16
privata right of action included in the original Title VI?
GENERAL McCREEs
cult part of my argument®

Well, I think that9si the most diffi­
All I can suggest was that the —

he knew too, however, that if this language formula was used,
that he need not win his effert for an egression — for an
express grant»
And the Congress did use this linguistic formula,
even though he was unable to get that®
If the Congress had intended net to grant a privat®
remedy, then it would have not concluded merely

with rebuffing

Senator Keating, it would seem to me, but it would have
expressed the contrary, ©r would have used contrary language,
as we can see it did in these other statutes®
This Court, of course, addressed the — this whole
matter of determining when a —» when there should b® an.
extension of a civil remedy to a person injured by another's
breach of a. right granted, in the ease of Corf va Ash, in
3.975,

and suggested four questions that must fee answered®

And I would like to consider those for a few 'minutss®
The first one, of course, is whether the plaintiff is
one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was
created,
I think it®a irrefutable here that Mrs, Cannon is
one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was
created,

I think we can conclude without argument that

17

she was a person who was to have received a federal right, and
that she did indeed receive it.
1 argue, as we do in star brief, on page 46 and the
following pages, that the use of the language’has'been
consistent in this respect»
The second question, of course, is whether there is
any indication of legislative intent to create a private
remedy or not»

Now, of course, if there was convincing evidence

of intent, we wouldn't even apply the Corfc v. Ash formula, if
there was unmistakable evidence that there was no intent, that
would conclude our discussion, and if there was unmistakable
evidence there was intent, it would as well»
Kara, we have to conclude that the
ambivalent.

.evidence is

Nevertheless, we suggest that such evidence as

exists does favor the finding that the legislature intended to
do it,
I suggested before the consistency of the language,and
I direct the Court's attention also to the fact that there were
lower court cases granting a private remedy in Title Vi, after
which Title IX was adopted, at the time the Congress adopted
Title

IX.
Now, whether the Congress was acutely and actually

aware of those decisions, I can't argue, but I can certainly
suggest that they were there for the Congress8 direction.
But even if we concede that the second point, that

18
of legislative intent, is ambivalent, we proceed to the third
points

is it consistent with the underlying purpose to

apply a remedy'?
1 suggest that the answer hers is a compelling yes*
My brother has indicated the problem of — of numbers that
would make it difficult for a parson whose rights were
offended to get' a privat® remedy*
I would also add that the cutoff isn't a remedy for
Mrs* Cannon*

And if the government should out off the funds,

she and many persons like here, still would be without a
remedy *
Also in the case of a single grant, single federal
grant, with nothing in the way of sustaining funds contemplated,
there would be no need for a cutoff.

And yet she would be with­

out any administrative remedy at all, because there isn't any­
thing an agency could d© for.her.
And finally, whether this is a right traditionally
relegated to state law.

I suggest that this is uniquely federal

•because federal funds are involved, and the federal government
has a right to be free from discrimination, or to see that its
funds are not employed to discriminate*
1 would conclude by saying that private litigation is
ah .indispensable compliment to government action.!f the goals
of Title IX — freedom from discrimination on the basis of
s@se

are fc© be achieved*

19

Thank you.
QUESTIONS

Mr, Solicitor General, may I corse back a

moment to the distinction yon make between Title VII and
Title IX with respect to Congress in Title VII having imposed
limitations on the use of the private remedy.
GENERAL MeCREEs
QUESTIONS

Yes.

What pussies me is why Congress should

have taken a different view, if it did, in Title IX, in view
of the capacity of the private remedy to disrupt education
and the freedom of faculties to choose student bodies.
In this ease, for example, there were some 2,000
applicants whose academic credentials were superior to the
plaintiff in this case.

So that I suppose if they had chosen

to bring individual suits, they could have been — 2,000
additional suits.
The disruption to the colleges would be vastly
greater, one would think, than the disruption, to private
industry, as a result of claims under Title VII.

What policy

considerations could have motivated Congress to make the
distinction you draw?
GENERAL MeCREEs

Mr. Justice Powell, I believe there

are two answers to the question.
The first one, is Title VII, the employment ease,
was an area into which the Congress has not ventured before,
and the basis for its jurisdiction there was a commerce clause,

20
and it was extending some previously understood concepts ©f
the commerce clause 5, and therefore thought it should closely
restrict the privat® remedy as it explored this new area of
extending federal power.
Here under Title IX there's absolutely n© question
about the power of Congress to control the spending of federal
funds, so it need not have felt so queasy about proceeding —
about affording a private remedy there.
1 think the second answer is
QUESTIONs

But may I comment on your first answer? In

view of the decisions of this Court under the Fair Labor
Standards Act, how could Congress have been queasy about its
powers under the commerce clause to enact

.Title VII?

Window

washers have been held to be engaged in interstate commarce.
GENERAL MeCREE %
any discrimination areas.

But -the Congress has not done so in
And this was its first venture in

that field.
QUESTION s

Does that make a difference?

GENERAL MeCREE2 Well, I would think it would.

I would

think the Fair Labor Standards Act rational® was the impact of
just economic factors on the commerce; and here* the nation
at the time Title VII was enacted was finally addressing soma
unfinished business of eliminating discrimination based on
race3 and there were reservations about it.
QUESTION;

You had a second reason, and I interrupted

21

you»
GENERAL McCP.EE s

1 would suggest that the second reason

is, an awareness that although Title VI had been law since
1964, there had been no disruption of educational programs
across tine nation, as the question suggested might result if
2,000 students who ranked below the particular applicant
brought a case*
My experience — my observation has been that Title
VI has not resulted in an inundation of the courts on the
basis of persons who believe they are aggrieved because of
race»

And I don’t think the same thing would happen under

Title IX on the basis of sex, and I think, the Congress was
probably aware of that.
QUESTIONS

General McCree, before you sit down, I’m

curious about one things

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BERNSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE NGN-FEDERAL RESPONDENTS
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and way it please

the Court:
Tha — it*s been implied in the arguments of
petitioner and the Solicitor General that Title VI and Title
IX are to be interpreted together.
You may recall that Title VI was the subject of
some consideration by the Court in the Baklee case.
our position that Section 1 of each of these titles

It is
states a

policy, and that Section 2 creates a very elaborate enforce­
ment procedure.
And that enforcement procedure is exclusive.

We

think examining the terms of the statutes on their face
reveals this ; we think that the studying of Title VI and the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, where other titles did contain
specific provision for private remedies; confirms the intent
which appears on the face ©f it.

23
But most important, we think the legislative debates
which gave flesh to what appears on the face of the statute,
confirm the assertions w® have made in our brief»
Now, throughout this litigation, we have constantly
referred to the legislative debates, what was said, what
exchanges were had, on the floor of the Senate and House?
and up until last Thursday, wa have had no response feo this
from the petitioner.
Last Thursday a bsief was filed, a reply brief, which
sets out some excerpts from the legislative debates which
purport to make the point that the first section of Title VI,
and by implication, Title IX, was independent of the enforce­
ment procedure under Section 2 of these titles, and that therefore the impliaction is that a private right of action could
be implied even though there was no express provision.
Since I could not anticipate these references, nor
will I have a further opportunity to respond, I would like to
»

'

start my argument with a reference to these arguments in th®
petitioner's reply brief, and show that they completely are
misstated, and I say that advisedly? and certainly do not
support the position asserted»
The first exchange described in the reply brief is

following quotation which is set out in the brief.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Bernstein, I'm sorry.

MR. BERNSTEINs
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

What page of the reply brief?

MR. BERNSTEINs

X5m sorry, page 14, Mr. Justice

Rehnquisfc»
QUESTIONs

Thank you.

MR. BERNSTEINs

It says, Senator Talm&dge continued,

and I’m quoting, “the people have the authority to go to
court, and the Senator admits they have that right, and
Senator Humphrey is quoted as responding, yes.
Now the implication is that they have the right to
go to court under Section 1, Title VI and Title IX.

2S
Well, not so.

This was the culmination of-a long

statement by Senator Talmadge opposing the Civil Rights 'Act
in its entirety, and Title VI in particular.

And the point

he was making was that there was a pre-existent state right
under 1983 for a right of action against the state action,
where the discrimination was alleged, whether there was ©r
was not federal funding.
tod his point was that this act, which gave the
power to the executive to cut off federal funding, was totally
unnecessary.

It was very oppressive, and had the seeds for

destruction of local governments,

tod I'll quote where he

said just about that.
And to the extent there was a legitimate governmental
interest in this matter, it was already covered under 1983,
and it was in this context, that he made the point that the
people havethe authority to go feo court, and the Senate admits
they have that right.
Ha was speaking of the then-existing state of the
law, not of the bill which was than being considered.
Senator Humphrey responded, y@s, they do.

And

And then Senator

Talmadge, which sort ©f sums up th© point he was trying feo
make, says, why does

not th® Senator rely on the Court's

authority, instead of giving arbitrary, capricious, wholesale
punitive power to some federal bureaucrat to starve entire
cities, towns, states and regions at one fell swoop?

26
He simply didn°t like Titi® VX at all.

He was simply

urging on the Senate that they not adopt it in its entirety®
Senator Humphrey responded, and X6m reading now
from the Congressional Record, 110, page 5246, which was not
included in the reply brief, Senator Humphrey replied, but
we develop here what X call the legislative history®

I wish

to make it clear that Section S02 ~ second section -- is a
limitation on the enforcement of the law set out in Section
601 of Title VX to those agencies affected by Title VX.
Nov that exchange disturbed, Senator Case, because he
thought that that statement could be implied as lira!ting the
pre-existing rights under 1983»

So Senator Case got into

the act, and he said to Senator Humphrey, now, X8m disturbed
about that limitation language*

X don't want this statute to

taka away pre-existing rights®
And that's when the exchange culminated in the two
quotations you find at the bottom of page 14®

Now you611

se© that there are dots indicating omissions from those
quotations, and the dots are very significant, and go to the
heart of this case.

But they have been momitted.

I’d like to

fill the dots in if X may.
Senator Case says, and X*m quoting from what's in the
brief, for myself I would not be satisifed if this language
of Section 602 is intended to limit existing rights of
individuals under the constitution, ©r to limit the rights

21
expressed in Section SOI, in any substantial sense — dots.
All right, here8s what the dots say.

Federal

departments or agencies# with authority to disburse loans,
grants, tor to mak© contracts in order to eliminate
discrimination in programs win which those contracts, loans
or grants are involved, must proceed in the fashion stated.
With that I agree.

And then he goes on.

;

That is the intent.

However, it is not intended to

limit the rights of individuals if they have any way of
enforcing their prights apart from the provisions off the bill?
apart from the provisions of the bill — by way ©f suit or
any other procedure.
The provision of the bill is not intended te cut
down ©ay rights that exist.

That was the thrust of the

discussion which was set out her© on page 14.
Then Senator Humphrey responded, as is set out h<are,
I thoroughly agree with the Senator» insofar as the individual
is concerned, and her© you $@@ dots again,

Now hera9s what

the dots say.
As a citizen of the United States, he has his full
constitutional rights.

He has his full ~ he has his right fe@

go to court and institute suit# and whatever may be provided in
the law and in the constitution.
They were tailing about existing law, not what th@
bill would do.

And the impliaction in the reply brief that

28
somehow this was intended to

enlarge these rights or to

change existing law, is completely foreclosed by the discussion
I have alluded to.
Mow, there's on© more «—
QUESTION %

Doesn’t that boil down to, Mr. Bernstein,

suggesting that they were not opposed to a private right ©f
a etion?
MR. BERNSTEINs

Well

sir, if yon anticipate me.

Because Senator Keating then immediately chimed in.
QUESTION %

Talked about his own bill?

MR. BERNSTEIN%
QUESTIONS

Pardon?

Talked about his own bill?

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Well, no, he comes right along.

And

he said that he understood the point that Senator Case was
making, and be was glad he got it cleared up, but he had another
problem.
This problem was that the bill did not provide a
private right of action for the individual.

And here’s what

he says.
Under

Section S03 — that’s the judicial review

section ~ a state or political subdivision of a state, or
an agency of either, which is denied funds because ©f
discrimination ~ because discrimination is taking place is
given the right ©f action in court.
But there is no e©rr@l@tiv© right in th© citizen.

29

He's not talking about his bill,, he's talking about this bill
that's before them for consideration.
If funds are granted for discriminatory projects by
public officials, the citizen who is denied the benefits of the
project,, has no correlative right to bring a suit in court#
and he should have.
tod that's why he found the bill objectionable.
But they never did change the bill# Your Honors.
Now# clearly# he would have liked to have had a
privata right of action,
and I don't like it.
QUESTION:

But what he said# it isn't in there#

tod he-never got it

in,

You say that negates any idea that

Congress omitted it because they thought it was unnecessary
and already in there.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Sir# I submit there's only conclusion

to be drawn* but that they wanted to get it in there# it
wasn't in there# and he didn't like the fact that it wasn't in
there.

earn© along and enacted Titi® IX, there could be a different
prevision in Title IX, there eould be adifferent legislative

34
history in Titia IX, ©r there could be the existing legal
environment could be such that you had to assume that Congress
knew what the law was, or what the lower courts thought the
law was,
MR. BERNSTEINs

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

And we’ve addressed that, of course, in our briefs, your
Honor.
I think all of us have agreed, all the — the
petitioner, the Solicitor General, all the amici in this case —
and there are many of them ~ we all agree that the legis­
lative history of Title VI carries over into Title X2C.
Senator Bayh so said, whan he introduced Title IX.

And

He said,

we’re doing the same thing we did under Title IX, provides the
same procedures, the same regulations, that have worked so
well under Titia IVI.
QUESTIONS

What if some courts had already said

what they thought Title VI did?
with what the lower courts said.

Even if you might disagree
What if the lower courts had

held this, and the Senator, wh@2i h® was talking, had those
cases specifically in mind.
MR. BERNSTEINs

Well, ®s the Court of Appeals pointed

out below, there’s no indication that any Senator ©r any
legislator ©f any on© of these eases that have b©sn referred
to in the briefs.
Further, &b

have repeatedly asserted here,

these

35
eases are mostly equivocal on the point, b@eause the
jurisdictional basis was not necessarily Title VI itself,
QUESTIONS

Then I take it that also in the legis­

lative history of Title IX, there were some Senators who
expressly addressed the question, and said, it should — this
shouldn’t be — we are not indicating that there is a private
cause of action»
MR, BERHSTEINs

There's an implication that there is

such a thing, but I haven't found it, Your Honor.

We have

rather carefully combed ~ in all candor, I must say, we
haven't found that reference.
QUESTION?

What they said was, we don't intend to

change the law, whatever it is now.
MR. BERNSTEINS

That's — this is the thrust.

What­

ever the law — whatever they did in .1964 in Title VI, that
was the thrust of what Senator Bayh said when he introduced
the bill.
QUESTIONS

I'm thinking of the colloquy with

Congressman Railaback that Judge Bauer referred to,
MR. BERNSTEINs

Oh, that referred not t© the adoption

of Title IK, but to the civil rights attorneys' award.
QUESTIONS

Oh, that's right.

MS. BERNSTEINs

which occurred just last year,

while this case was in the Court of Appeals ©n a hearing?
it was an entirely different matter®

36

What we submit is that apart from the clear
construction of the statute, and apart from upsetting the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, that the legislative history,
which I refer to here, clearly supports our side, if you apply
the second test of Corfe v. Ash, namely, was there an intent ©f
Congress to deny or create*
And Senator Keating says there was an attempt to
deny, and he decried that fact*
QUESTION:

Well, is that fair, Mr. Bernstein?

He

said, there was a failure to create, and he was unhappy there
was a failure to create.
But is that quite the same as a statute that says,
there shall be no other remedy except the one we expressly
provided for?
MR. BERNSTEIN:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor ~

There8s no exclusivity provision in the

statute.
MR. BERNSTEIN:
we read the words.

=— I suppose we have trouble on how

But when he says that a citizen who is

denied the benefits has no right to bring a suit in court, I
think he's saying that there is no right to bring a suit in
court.
QUESTION:

Under the bill; no right expressly provided

for under the bill.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

The one that they're passing; that9s

37
the bill they ultimately passed.
Now, if he,says that I -- you know, we can play
with the wordsas to putting it positively or negatively, but
I think he says there is no right.

1 think he says it almost

in so many words,
I think — to conclude this part of my presentation —
I think that this clearly sets out that with respect t© the
second test — we accept the first and the fourth as set out
by the Solicitor General — but the second test, namely, what
is the intent of Congress, I think it could hardly he. clearer.

QUESTION’S

You haven't mentioned *»- before you leave

that, you haven't mentioned Congressman Celler, Chairman of the
Judiciary Committee of the House and certainly on top ©f hthis
problem, what he said over on page 25 of your brief.

MR. BERNSTEIN:
Page 25?

Well, sir, I ~

Excuse me, sir.

38
QUESTION %

Page 25 of your brief, yes»

MR, BERNSTEINS

Yes, this is Title VI.

The

difficulty is, there was very little legislative history on
Title IX , other than its introduction by Senator Bayh.

And

thates why all the legislative history referred to in the
brief here goes back to Title VI, and everybody agrees that IX
was patterned on VI? in fact, it's claimed that one was a
photocopy ©f the other.
And we don't dispute that.

We think ifc9s quite

right.
But thereB s a private action under Titia VI; there *s
one under IX.
This was all under Title VI.
Xsd like t© get to the third test ©f Corfc vB Ash,■
namely, whether it's consistent with the underlying legislative
scheme.

And here I9d like to pick up the reply brief of ~ the

brief of the Solicitor General's,
Now, you may recall

Justice White made the

point in his concurring opinion in Bakke ~ that to permit a
private right of action under the first section would in effect
to be — to bypass the elaborate administrative procedure
under Section 2.
QUESTIONS

Yeah, the difficulty is that in this

case, I was the only one to ~
MR. BERNSTEINs

Well, sir, I recognize that I have

39

that burden.

But J0m glad t© have your support,

I trust —

I'm hoping that my eloquence can convince some other members
of the Court,
The Justice Department took issue with Justice
White5s statement that this represented a bypass ~ that this
would represent a bypass of the administrative procedure,
and they said there's no inconsistency.
Yet they said — or let me point the fact out —
Mrs. Cannon9s complaint was filed with them in April ©f 1975,,
and they still haven't acted on it.

They completed their

on-’Site investigations, University of Chicago, Northwestern
University,, in June ©f 1976? at least they so advised,, in
June 9 76, on-site investigations have been completed.

The

questions she raises concerning age, raises an issue national
in scope, they have to have a national policy on its, and they
sure her they will act as expeditiously as possible.
That letter from HEW is set out in the Appendix to
the petition for certiorari, it0® from HEW to Mrs, Cannon.
That was in 1976.

Nothing's happened yet.

What they said in their original brief to this
Court was that if the Court should decide there was no private
right of action, then they’d complete their investigation.
if there’s no inconsistency between the

Well,

administrative and

judicial procedure, why wait till this Court acts?
They should have gone ahead and completed it.

They

40

explained in their reply brief something else»

They say that

and I think I can quote the words exactly — they say that
since the district court, the courts have decided there was
no private right of action, and since HEW couldn’t itself
resolve that question, he was going to defer further action
pending the outcome of this case.
Nobody asked HEW to decide that.
function.

That's not their

There function is not to decide whether there's

a private right of action.

There function is to act on

administrative complaint s under Section 2.
It is clear that what HEW is saying, that if you
decide that there's a private right ©f action, we'll just wash
our hands of this matter.

We won't go any further.

If they don't mean that, why have they

waited?

Why have they waited?
QUESTIONS

Is it reasonable to assume, Mr. Bernstein

that had. the HEW acted in 1976, that there could have been
by this time judicial review of that administrative determi­
nation?
MR. BERNSTEINs
©f course true,

Yes, of sours®, Your Honor, that is

ted I must express some concern and sympathy

with Mrs. Cannon's plight.

I think it's unfair that she's

had to wait this long.
But I think it's a doing of HEW , and I say that in
all candor, and perhaps with a little anger.

I think HEW has

pulled itself down by its bootstraps»
it says, you see,, w© can’t act.
QUESTION:

It hasn’t acted» And

And therefore —=■

Ar© you suggesting that they9 re under-

taking to compel this Court to decide the scop® of their
responsibilities instead ©f deciding it themselves?
MR» BERNSTEIN:
is clear.

Well, I think their responsibility

Nobody has said — they haven’t suggested that they

have no authority under Section 2 to proceed.
they need this Court to tell them that.

I don’t think

That’s clear.

I think what they’re saying is, that if this Court
says she can go to court, then we don’t proceed? and that’s
the bypass that Justice White was talking about.

It’s

inevitable.
Yon got another dilemma.
proceed two ways;

Let’s suppose they do

administratively and judicially.

It

comes up in court on one standard of review? it comes up to
•the administrative agency for judicial review under the APA
standard review, which is entirely different.
S©;, conceptually, at least, the same court can
decide the same question under different standards and
come out different ways.
The dilemma is simply unavoidable.

It seems to me,

if the Court pleas®, that there’s no way you can give credit
to the elaborate chssheme under Section 2 of each of these
statutes if you all an independent private right of action.

42
Judicial review is another matter.
So 1 submit that this clearly sets forth the
answer to the third Cort v0 Ash test,
Mo the government makes one other point in its reply
brief ~ I think it was lecturing me? but I’m net quite sure,
about my failure to perceive the difference between primary
jurisdiction and exhaustion of remedies.
And they go to great detail to explain that in
circumstances like this, where they are in court on a Title VI
case, they may, under the appropriate circumstances, ask the
court to defer action while they complete the administrative
process, and they say that’s the doctrine of primary juris­
diction, that’s what they’re talking about,
And they . seem particularly upset by my statement
that I was confused about the course of conduct in various
eases that we cited in our brief.
The unfortunate part of'the government’s position
is that they, in fact, in the Terry v. Methodist Hospital of
Gary case,

which we refer to in ©ur brief, they themselves

filed a motion to dismiss for failure to ~ for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction, because of lack of exhaustion?
the ver/ point we*r@ trying fc© make, they themselves made,
but now they deny that.
Well, they withdrew that motion subsequent!/,
but they withdrew it not because they felt the exhaustion

43
doctrine wasn't proper* but because they wanted ~ they
explained in a later document* they wanted to facilitate
settlement.
So they themselves have adopted the exhaustion
argument* if the Court

please.

We're not doing anything

novel here.
And it seems to me it's inevitable that you de that
if you're to make any sense out of this statute.

Otherwise*

you have a shambles.
1 think this is the essence of my case* because
what I’m really talking about is what Congress intended and
not what Mr. Cannon wants or what I want.

It's ultimately

what Congress said.
There are a few minor things.
upon* but they are in the briefs.

They weren't touched

And that is* the recent

amendments to the age discrimination act* which now provides
for a specific private right of action, with exhaustion.
And we made the point in our brief that this
manifests an intent that when Congress menas t© have a right
of action under these kinds of statutes* it knows how to
say so clearly.
QUESTIONS

But that°s a different Congress than the

one that enacted Title IX.
MR. BERNSTEINs

I understand* sir.

ms* I'm doing this in the defensive posture.

If you'll forgive
They said that

44
1 can't read the amendment that way, because the amendment
implies a pre-existing right*

1 simply wanted to call your

attention to the conference report* which we haven't had a
chance to do before* because there was a difference between the
House and the Senate on that issue*
But the conference report says as follows?

the

House bill amended the age discrimination act of 1975 by
specifically providing for a private right of action for
violations of the act*
I'm responding to the point that that really wasn't
what was done.

And I point to the conference report to say

that that was done.
I agree that actions of subsequent legislatures are
not very significant in trying to shed light on what precede.
QUESTIONs

That really only proves that this partial-

lar Congress knew how to create a private cause of action* not
necessarily that the preceding one did.
MR. BERNSTEINs

Well* I accept that.

I — if it

please the Court* I think that is the essence of our position.
In summary* it is again* not

oh, I'm sorry.

One

other thing I have to refer to.
The Solicitor General said in his reply brief that
going to court is really not a very serious problem.

All you

have to do is have the judge ask the question — for example*
Mrs. Cannon* was she kept out because of her age* or for sem©

45
other reason?
And ©nee you answer that question, that's easy,

I

have the impression that whoever wrote that brief for the
Solicitor had never tried a ease.
If it weis that easy, we would not be here.

We would

have done just that.
It's a little mor© complicated than that.
What our concern is, you see, the deposing of the
admissions committee.

Mr. Cannon already filed a notice in
?

the district court to take the deposition of Bean Sitchammel,
who is the chairman ©f the admissions committee at the
University of Chicago medical school.
Well, what he-’ll depose, him about?
Mrs. Cannon acceptable?

Well, why wasn't

How about these other 2,000 which

you say were better than her and were turned down?

How about

the 104 you accepted?
We have 5,500 people that we can have discovery
about.

He has full discovery available.

He's already served

a notice to discover all that we have ©n her, including any
references that we got through her applications? that is,
references from third parties,
All that's available.

And that is what is involved.

It isn't simply a matter of the University coming in and
saying, Mr. Judge, we didn't admit this lady because of her
grades.

46
Mr. Cannon wouldn't be satisfied with that, and he'd
be a bad lawyer if h© was.

He wants to know why.

And we9re

subject to that.
And 1 submit t© yous

You put sin admissions committee

through that once, and they're not going to do this again.
They're going to make their decisions on striet grades, and
nothing else? because then you can't get at them.
And that's what they're worried about, and that's
what we're worried about.

And that's why we say in our

briefs that at bottom this is an academic freedom issue.
Because this Court has said — you've cited the
Harvard admissions program where diversity is a desirable
factor in student bodies.

We've set out our admission

program, which is aimed to the same end.
But if you submit ua to this kind of court proceeding,
we9 re not going to have that.
QUESTION %

Well, how do you get academic freedom --

are you suggesting that there's some sort of constitutional
right that favors you because of, quote, academic freedom,

having gotten into it, let me see if I can get out of it.
What we are concerned about, sir, is that if you
shift the arena, no matter how it comas out -- as I stated in
our brief, we9re not concerned about the
the ease.

ultimate merits of

W@ have not conceded feh® "but for™ question at all.
But if you start the discovery route -- if you start

that route — you're going to have a shilling effect ©n the
independence of the admissions committe©.

I think that's

inevitable.
And Your Honor has had sufficient trial experience,
I know, to know the problem of clients and the deposition
procedure.

It does have & chilling effect.

And this is our

concern.
QUESTION?

Whafe do you mean by a chilling effect?

Granted, you sen say, what do we mean by a chilling effect?

49
MR. BERNSTEINs

I think I was doing pretty well.

By chilling effect, I mean is this

That the

concern of academics that fchay will have to justify their
decisions in a court of law,
QUESTION;

Well, but if the petitioner is right.

Congress intended to chill admissions committee decisions
based on sax.
MR. BERNSTEIN;

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry.

I'm not --

I5m proceeding on the assumption now that in terms of the
policies involved here, to the extent that enters into this,
that there is

a.

strong policy which would militate against

the private right of action, and that if this issue is
going to be explored, it ought to be explored fully.
QUESTION;

Where did that policy come from?

MR. BERNSTEIN;

The policy that I have enunciated

about ~
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BERNSTEIN;

Well, the policy comes from the fact

that I think that if you implicate the judiciary in admissions
decisions, then you have threatened academic freedom.
QUESTION;

But you said a moment ago in response to

my questions that you didn't assert any constitution claims
based on academic freedom.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Xem speaking of academic freedom, sir,

in the same sense that it was used by Justice Powell in Bakk@.

I think it was a quasi-constitutional right? I forget0
QUESTION:

But what is a quasi-constitutional right?

MR. BERNSTEIN s
QUESTION s

I'm waiting for the red light.

Perhaps we9 re asking you to define our

terms.
MR. BERNSTEINs

Yeah# well I enjoy this, so X*d like

to take a stab at it.
QUESTIONs

As I understand your argument, Mr. Bernstein,

you8 re saying that these people on th© admissions committe©
who are going to be chilled are more afraid ©f a suit by
aomeona lik© the plaintiff in this ease than they are afraid of
having their funds cut off by the federal government if they
engage in dubious discriminatory policy.
Which is th© more serious remedy?
MR. BERNSTEIN :

I have — the — the fact of the

matter is, thera's been no discrimination.
where do you establish that fact?
QUESTION :

The question is,

That*s th© issue.

Well, they don111 have to establish — the

plaintiff has t© prove the contrary.

I just — it just

doesn't seam to me that you're going to be seared to death of
Mrs. Cannon, but not worry at all about HEW about all your

funds.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Well, I can only repeat what I said,
s

Your Honors

That this case, we think, will ©pen the floodgates

t© a multiplicity ©f suits.

You heard the description of

SI
some 3,500 things pending before HEW, all of which could be
shifted to the courts»
QUESTION:
to schools.

Mow, certainly, it’s a ~

But you really ~~ it doesn’t apply just

It applies to hospitals and all sorts of other

things, too, doesn’t it?

MR. BERNSTEINs

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

Of

course.
QUESTION:

So this isn’t just an academic freedom

issue; it’s © question ©£ how to construe this statute.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

Well, we’re picking up academic

freedom again. Your Honor, because academic freedom seemed to
fea a concern of this Court, or at least to two ©f its members,
in the Bakke case.
We are sn academic institutioni,
university is an academic institution,
ab©ufe the same

Northwestern

tod we are concerned

a© I’va demonstrated.

QUESTION:

Like you said, 1 am o©ne@rn@i about

academic freedom, and I011 apeak fe© my brothers in private
about that.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bernstein, I took'yotir

'reference — we've been snaking yen skitter all over the lot
here.

But going make to that colloquy with Mr'. Justice

Rehnquist, I took your suggestion about policy to mean that
fell© legislative history you were discussing earlier, and
which is reproduced in the briefs her®, indicates that as a

52
matter of policy. Congress did not grant- a private cause of

action.
That's th® policy you were talking about.
MR. BERNSTEINS

That's right.

Yes, Your Honor.

Also, our —■ the second Corfc v. Ash test, as to what the
Congress intended.

Y©s, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURSERg

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
