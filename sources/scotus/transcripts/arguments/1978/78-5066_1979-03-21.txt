MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Dunaway against New York.
Mr. Nowak, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD JOHN NOWAK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NOWAK:
this Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case directly puts an issue

the rights

of our citizens to be free from arrests or seizures for
purposes of police investigation without probable cause
under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitu­
tion and as applied by this Court in 1975 to the case of
Brown v. Illinois.
This case may also present a further issue,
because if this case is not decided in accordance with
Brown v. Illinois, then this Court will be faced with
resolving the issue of the important right of our citizens
to be free from unreasonable seizures for purposes of
investigative detention, a question that was left open by
uhis Court in Terry v. Ohio and again left open in Morales v.
New York.
If I may briefly outline the facts:
There x^as a murder in the city of Rochester at a
pizza parlor March 26 of 1971.

The proprietor of that

establishment was fatally wounded during the course of an

4
attempted robbery.
The next fact we have from the record — we do not
knew what the police did from the record between March 26
and August 10.

We know that on August 10 the police received

information from an inmate who was incarcerated in the Monroe
County Jail whom they had never used before, who was never
established in this record as having been reliable.

They

received information from this Mr. Sparrow indicating that a
Mr. Cole and a Mr. Irving Axelrod committed this particular
murder at the pizza parlor.
At that point in time, the police officer who was
in the jail called the lieutenant in charge of the criminal
investigation of the Physical Crimes Squad.

The lieutenant

came down to police headquarters at about 8 o'clock at night,
and he questioned Mr. Sparrow, and he asked Sparrow where he
got his information, how did he come about knowing this.
Sparrow indicated that Cole told him he did it.
The police then went and confronted Cole, who at
that time was also incarcerated in the Monroe County Jail.
Alter two hours of questioning, Cole persisted and denied
any involvement whatsoever, in this homicide.

He said, "I had

nothing to do with it, but I will tell you who did.
L°

I didn't

hut Irving Axelrod did it with another guy called

"BaBa" Adams.
The police at that point said, "Who told you this,

5

Mr, Cole?"
"Somebody else, Adams' brother, a guy named Hubert
Adams."
"Well, where's Hubert Adams?"
"He’s in the Elmira Correctional Facility,” which
is about 90 miles south of Rochester.
What did the police do?
Again, I would like to emphasise that Mr. Cole is
a person charged with a crime, never having been used at all
in any way, his reliability has never been established.
And while his reliability had never been established, he is
denying that he was involved in this crime, which is the
original information that they got, that he was involved.
QUESTION:

Where did the interrogation of Cole

take place?
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:

At the Monroe County Jail.
Where he was incarcerated on another

charge.
MR. NOWAK:

He was incarcerated, your Honor.

They took him from the jail to an interview room.
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

He was already in jail on some -He was in jail on other charges, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

He wasn't brought to the jail for

MR. NOWAK:

No, he wasn’t.

Now, Cole gave this information.
the police do when they had this information?

Now, what did
They didn’t

go question Hubert Adams who was the source of the informa­
tion to try to verify an unreliable informant.
QUESTION:

Instead, the •

You have, I think for the third time,

called him an unreliable informant.

Is the first information

that a citizen gives police inherently unreliable on your
theory?

Must he give several reliable reports before he

establishes his reliability?
MR. NOWAK:

It would be preferable if he did.

he didn't, it must be verified by some other source.
QUESTION:

It’s inherently unreliable

If

OK?
if it's

the first time the police hear from him.
MR. NOWAK:

If the police hear from him for the

first time, they can then go to the scene and what they see.
.'.i a person on a tip says So and So is selling marijuana and
also has a firearm; he is on the corner of — let’s pick two
streets

Main Street and State Street.

The police go to

_.be corner and there is a guy dressed as the informer’ said he
would, be.

OK, then we have a different situation, because

now they have acted on some information and they have been
able to corroborate what his story was.
In this case the police took no action to
corroborate this person who just gave them some information

7
while he is denying his own guilt.
QUESTION;

From your point of view, the results

obtained by the police invalidate the accuracy of the tip,
as it were.
MR. NOWAK:

No, because they didn’t corroborate it

before.
QUESTION:

Hypothetically.

You said if they did

this in the hypothetical case.
MR. NOWAK;
QUESTION:

But they didn’t in this case.
What is your authority for the require­

ment of corroboration, as you put it, in a situation such as
this where there was no search warrant, or arrest warrant
obtained?
MR. NOWAK:
no authority.

In a situation such as this, there is

I think this is the first case that will talk

about that particular point of law.

In drug or firearm cases

there are cases that indicate the tip must be substantiated
to some point.
QUESTION:

That’s the Draper case.

But am I quite

mistaken in my apprehension that there is no issue of whether
there was or was not probable cause?
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

There is no issue —
Everybody agrees there was not?
There i3

no issue whatsoever.

probable cause, isn't that correct?
MR,- NOWAK:
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

That is correct.
That's what I thought,
What subsequently followed was that

the police then issued an order to go pick up and bring in
Mr.

Dunaway acting on this information.

And that night two

teams of police officers went out, were unable to locate Mr.
Dunaway during the evening hours, and at 8 o'clock in the
morning they went to his house.
they asked where he was.

Upon arrival at his house

His mother said,

“He's not home."

A.ae police officer said, '’I am going to see for myself," and
they walked in and looked through the house.

Mr. Dunaway was

not there.
Another officer who was with this team was standing
watch oi tne house to make sure, as he said, no one jumped,
from windows or tried to run out the back door.

He noticed

a young lady leave the house and go to a house three doors down.
So wiien ulie team of detectives who entered the house came back.
ouc' ne saadf

'Lets follow her because she went a couple

houses over and he might be there."

9
They went to the house.

Mr. Dunaway was there.

Mr. Dunaway was subsequently taken downtown by the police
and questioned.
We have a fact that now becomes important, I think,
to the entire issue in this case, and that is whether or not
the petitioner was in fact arrested or seized in accordance
with the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Why not give us the facts.

What did

they do?
MR. NOWAK:

The police testimony is, "We asked him

if he would go downtown with us, and he said yes."
The defendant's testimony is that they came up
and they said, "We are going downtown to question you.”

And

one of the officers grabbed him by the belt of his pants and
led him toward the police car.
QUESTION:

How many police officers were there

MR. NOWAK:

There were three police officers.

altogether?

QUESTION:

Three of them making --

MR. NOWAK:

Three police officers who stand 6 feet

three, over 210 pounds.

This defendant is an 18-year-old

black youth who weighs about 145 pounds.
Now, the findings of fact —■
QUESTION:
to

Ordinarily that would be enough force

like an arrest, wouldn’t it?

10

MR. NOWAK:

It certainly would.

The hearing court,

in fact, found that there was an arrest in this case.

The

issue that comes forth is that the appellate division found
that the defendant went voluntarily.

The court of appeals

of the State of New York denied us permission to appeal this,
dismissed our application.

We filed a petition for

certiorari.
QUESTION:

Is there anything inherently

inconsistent between a person being arrested and going without
resistance?
MR. NOWAK:

No.

That is the exact point that I am

about to make, your Honor, that if a person, is accosted by
the police and goes along voluntarily, there are many Federal
cases which hold that that still constitutes an arrest as
.ong as the person being seized feels that he is so restricted.
And the testimony in this case which is crucial is that Mr.
Dunaway asked the porice in the police car while going downtown,
Why do we have to go downtown?"

And the police said, "You'll

find out when we get there."
Now, I think that that type of a request indicates
1 "iat the Police had seized this individual and in fact had
arnohd hire ac this point in time.

They didn't answer his

carect request to find out why they had to go downtown.

And

the record, I think, is also clear that there was an objection
one of the questions about putting emphasis, counsel, on the
word "had."

The court said, "Objection overruled, the officer

11
knows what we are driving at," and the officer said, "If I
remember correctly, that’s what he said, ’Why do we have to
go downtown?' "
So I think the state of mind of this defendant is
clear that he felt he was arrested.

It’s also clear from the

stipulation on the record that the people who stipulated, the
officers when they went out intended to arrest, because the
officers many times have said, "When we have a warrant of
arrest, our directive is to pick them up and bring them in."
QUESTION:

Didn’t the State courts agree in their

final judgment there was a detention?
MR. NOWAK:

They agreed that there was a detention,

that's correct.
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

Against his will.
Well, they said he went along

voluntarily, but a detention.
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

I don't see where —

Where do you find this voluntary?

And that’s why I don’t know why they

QUESTION:

The trial court 'found, just to the

contrary.
MR. NOWAK:

That's correct.

And the people are

contending in point one of their brief that he did go along
voluntarily.
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

The finding was otherwise.
That's correct.

That's what I am

trying to point out to the Court at this time.

I think the

finding is otherwise, but the people say that he did go along
voluntarily and they are relying on the use of the word
"voluntary'' in that Appellate Division opinion.

But I don't

see how they can use it when they say at the same time he
was detained.
QUESTION:

We don't sit to retry the facts here.

I think you ought to get to the law of this case.
MR. NOWAK:

And the question becomes:

14
Do we apply the exclusionary rule?

And was the confession

attenuated from the initial illegality, that is, detention
of this person at police headquarters without probable cause?
QUESTION:

The Fourth Amendment doesn’t say anything

about arrest; it talks about seizure.
MR. NOWAK:

It does talk about seizure, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And that’s the real question, isn't it?

MR. NOWAK:

I believe if a person is arrested, he

is seized.
QUESTION:

It's pretty clear that you are not

seised if you consent to go along with somebody.

That's

not. a seizure.
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
If you consent to go along with a man

vith a machine gun, I’m not too sure that’s consent.
■QUESTION:

Well, then it isn't consent.

MR. NOWAK:

QUESTION:

are two different terms of art.
If the police wanted him, why didn't

they just telephone and tell him to come on down?
MR. NOWAK:

They didn't do that.

That's a

significant fact that they didn't ask by phone.

15

QUESTION:

They didn't send one,, they sent four,

four officers.
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION;
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

Three officers.
Three.
That's correct.
To deliver a message, please come down.
They said, "We want to talk to you

downtown."
QUESTION:

Mr. Nowak, I am sorry to go back to

the facts, but there seems to be a general consensus that
there was no change in the finding of the trial judge, but
on page 126 the Appellate Division says, "This testimony
shows that the police legally detained the defendant for
questioning."

And then at the top of page 127 they say, "In

our opinion, the police conduct here is proper."
So isn't it rather clear that you are corrcect in
saying that they did . find that, there was a voluntary
submission to the police?
MR. NOWAK:
neant by that.

No, I don't think that's what they

They felt that the detention was legal

because of the application of the Morales case, which is a
New York Court of Appeals case, which says you can detain
people on reasonable suspicion, and that's probable Cause.
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

All right.
And that’s why they classified the

.16
detention as being legal.

In my opinion it is clearly

violative of the Fourth Amendment.

And we have to look at

whether or not there is now the attenuation that is needed in
aPPlying the criteria established by this Court in Brown.
The first criteria is the proximity of the arrest to the
confession.

In Brown there were two hours between the

initial arrest and the detention.

In this case there was

one hour.
Was there any intervening circumstance* the
entering of counsel* the arraignment before a local magistrate?
In Brown there was none? in this case there was none.
What was the purpose of the official misconduct
in this case?

It was clearly by the police's own admission
♦

for the purposes of interrogation.

Exactly the same improper

purpose in Brown.
QUESTION;

Mr. Nowak, excuse me again, but you are

arguing the attenuation point now, if I understand you
correctly.
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Because there is an intermediate point.

The legal proposition that is disputed is whether or not the
police can ever bring a man in just on reasonable suspicion.
Is it your view that it can never be done, say, to fingerprint
him, put him in a lineup, ask him questions?

Is there any

time when a suspect against whom there is no probable cause

17
but there is reasonable suspicion can be detained?

What is

your view of the law?
MR. NOWAKs

My view is that at this time under the

law of Brown it cannot
effect he is

when he is brought in because in

arrested at that point in time.

When he is

brought in in that type of a fashion., he cannot be —- what
was done to this petitioner cannot be done to anyone for any
purpose.

They need probable cause.
QUESTION;

For fingerprinting or for a lineup.

MR. NOWAK;

For fingerprinting or for a lineup.

Now, there could be a situation that could be
developed where they could go to his house and say to him,
"Would you like to come,” and he says, "No."
QUESTION:
"No,"

You always have a case where he says,

and they say —■
MR. NOWAK:

Right.

They take him forcibly.

If

the police try to set up an appointment with him, if they go
to h;>.s house and say, "We would like to question you.
s.i.t.. here and have a talk ? ■

Let's

that might pose a different

problem because he may not be seised for purposes of the
Fourth Amendment.

But once seized, I think you need probable

cause.
QUESTION:

And that's for a lineup as well as

questioning?
MR. NOWAK:

I would say yes, sir„

18
QUESTIONt

Or for fingerprinting.

MR. NOWAK:

I think the Court held that in Davis v.

Mississippi, and that’s why I feel that is the law of the
state.
The last issue under Brown to determine whether or
not there is attentuation after the purpose of a misconduct
is the flagrancy.

And this is where there is some difference

of opinion between myself and the district attorney’s office.
The flagrancy of misconduct -— what is flagrant official
misconduct,, I guess, is the real question.

And I think in

the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Powell in Brown v.
Illinois he said that there are three types, or three
examples,he gave of

official flagrant misconduct.

The first is when the police clearly act without
probable cause.
The second is when they make a pretext arrest.
Thirdly, when they go in with arms, weapons drawn,
without probable cause.
And he cites those three examples.
rell within example three.

Clearly Brown

He was accosted at gunpoint in his

own home.
Example three does not apply to this case, and
therefore the people say there is no flagrancy.

But if you

look at Mr. Justice Powell’s concurring opinion, he says that
*.ne first example he gives is xi?hen they make an arrest without

probable cause.

In this case they conceded that they didn't

have probable cause.

They were directly asked by the

defense attorney on cross-examination, "Did you have probable
cause to get a warrant, or did you go get a warrant?"
He said, "I didn’t get a warrant because I knew I
didn’t have probable cause to get one."
Yet, knowing this, they -went to his house and
seized him.

And I submit to you, as did the dissent

at the

Appellate Division clearly stated this constitutes flagrant
official misconduct, when the police know they do not have
probable cause and they act without it.

And I think that this

is a flagrant misuse of official misconduct, and the exact
purpose of the exclusionary rule as it was used in Brown
would be served again by applying it in this case.
I would only point out that originally, in 1975
when Brown v. Illinois was decided, this case had been up to
this Court and certiorari was granted and it was remanded for
a rehearing.
QUESTION;

But when these police acted. Morales was

on the books in that circuit, wasn't it?
MR. NOWAK;

Morales, in my opinion, your Honor, has

never been the law because it has been dicta.

I think if the

Court would examine the opinion in Morales —
QUESTION;

What would reasonable people think about

This Court --- the New York courts thought this case

20
was governed by Morales, the Appellate Division did.

They

thought it was the law of New York.
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Well, what about police operating under

judgments like this?
MR. NOWAK:

If in fact the police are acting under

a statute which is later declared invalid, there are court
cases which indicate that the police are acting in good faith
and that is a criteria to consider.
QUESTION:

Morales is I suppose just a construction

of the New York statute stating the powers of the police.
MR. NOWAK:

I don’t believe it is, but in any

eve;nt —QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:

What is it, then?
I think it’s their interpretation of

what the Federal Constitution says.

That’s what the New

York court did, they said, "We interpret the Federal
Constitution as saying this, and we are going to hold that
this is in fact the case."
If the police were aware of Morales, I submit to
the Court that when they testified at the hearing in 1977 that
was conducted, they would have said, "Counselor, we don’t
need probable cause to pick him up ? we only need reasonable
suspicion."

But they didn't.

If they were aware of Morales,

chat's what they would have said.

21
Now, given the fact that they did —- or even if
they were acting in some sort of good faith to a law which
I say still is not on the books in the State of New York
because it was dicta, the court of appeals when Morales came
back said that he consented to the police seizure and
therefore we never get to the question we addressed.
QUESTION:

Police aren’t expected to distinguish

between dicta and holdings.
MR. NOWAK:
should.

No, I am not suggesting that they

I am just saying that there really was no reasonable

way or reason for the police to believe this was the law in
the State of New York.

Even if it was good faith alone, I

don't think should —
QUESTION:

You say the police said to themselves,

"We don’t have probable cause and we don’t need it, and
whether we need it or not, we are taking the fellow
MR. NOWAK:
1 feel.

That’s correct.

down."

That’s exactly what

They wanted to solve this murder and they were going

to go get this defendant instead of following leads that they
had available to them.
QUESTION;

And I don’t think that’s proper.
Judge

Denman’s

concurring opinion

did rely precisely on the point implicitly suggested by my
brother White’s question, didn’t he?
MR. NOWAK:
Court of Appeals.

She

was bound by the holding of the

22
QUESTIONS

She.

MR. NOWAK;

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

In Morales.

In Morales, yes.

MR. NOWAK:

But the Morales opinion, I would only-

ask the Court to note that that opinion specifically makes all
the findings that

s'ie relies on and then says we have a

second basis for our holding.

That is, that the defendant

Morales consented to the police detention, and therefore, it
obviated the real purpose of the rule they were seeking to
develop.

They said that he consented.
QUESTION:

This Court and alternative holdings,

they were both holdings.
MR. NOWAK:

I guess it could be said both holdings.

Maybe they made two separate ones and there was no need to
make it because they were relying on a consent issue.

When

a petition for certiorari was made to this Court, it was
denied., and I think properly so, because there was no
question, because he consented.

This Court specifically

remanded Morales to find out if he was arrested, whether he
consented, and whether there was probable cause.

Arid they

said he was not arrested because he consented.
I think that obviously answers the question this
lourt was seeking to address at that point in Morales.
Ls why I say it really never became the lax*.

That

But even if it

and the Court wishes to look at good faith, there is only

23
one of the three or four criteria that should be attached
to attenuation.

And I think there is no way in this case

thcit there was any attenuation.
I respectfully submit to the Court that in this
particular case Mr. Dunaway was seized for purposes of
interrogation.

This Court in 1975 remanded this case for

further consideration of Brown v. Illinois.

The hearing

court took in all the testimony and found as a fact this
defendant was arrested,, he was arrested without probable
cause, and in the hearing court's opinion even without
reasonable suspicion.

And further, the people offered

absolutely no evidence at the hearing to show attenuation.
QUESTION;

Mr. Nowak, on your attenuation point,

what is the ultimate conclusion one draws if one finds there
was attenuation?

Is it a conclusion that the confession was

voluntary?
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK;

If one finds attenuation?
Yes.
Before one gets to that question, the

threshold question is is there a voluntary confession under
the fifth and Sixth Amendments?

If you answer that question

yes, then you go to the Fourth Amendment question that was
posited in Brown.
QUESTION:
in this case —

As I understand it there is no claim

24
MR. NOWAK?

There is no claim that this confession

QUESTION:

— that this confession was involuntary.

was not —

MR. NOWAK:

No, there isn’t.

And the same — this

is the facts of the Brown case.
QUESTION:

I have to confess — what is it that

one is trying to find out by asking whether there was
attenuation?
MR. NOWAK:

Should the confession be suppressed?

Should the exclusionary rule apply?
QUESTION:

Attenuation like an adjective.

What ■—

if it is attenuated, then what -- I mean, does that mean if
it's attenuated then it’s admissible?
MR. NOWAK:

Then it is admissible in evidence

because the purge of the initial —
QUESTION:
about attenuation?

What are you looking for when you ask
What kind, of

MR. NOWAK:

You are looking to see if the defendant's

is one question.

Voluntariness under the Fifth Amendment

But an act of free will, an independent

intervening act of free will, which is what this Com.I
specifically drew upon in the Wong Sun case and again in
Brown, because Brown's confession was voluntary.

The Court

looked and said, "Can we say that his act of confessing was
not a result of the police illegality, that they went in and
seised him trying to get some evidence."
QUESTION:

It has nothing to do with his free

will because --MR. NOWAK:

It has nothing to do with —

was a voluntary statement.
MR. NOWxAK:
QUESTION:

It was voluntary.
Attenuation, as I understand it, and

perhaps I misunderstand it, is whether or not it is
sufficiently disconnected with the Fourth Amendment violation
by the police.
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And if it’s sufficiently

What makes it disconnected other than

vo 1 un t a r in e s s ?
QUESTION:
MR. NOWAK:
in Brown.

An intervening act.
There are certain facets enunciated

One was the arrest.

Did they exploit the illegal

26
detention to get this confession, or was he detained — was
he arrested .illegally, was he taken to the courtroom, was he
arraigned, given a lawyer?

And then he says,

"Look, I've

got a lawyer and I talked to him, but I still xvant to confess»
The court can look at that for Fourth Amendment purposes
and say, "That was an act of liis own will after he knew what
was going on.

They didn't exploit the illegal arrest to get

that confession from him."
But on the other hand if the defendant was
illegally arrested and as a result of that arrest, directly
within hours and minutes of being seized,gives a confession,
he has never had a lawyer, entered a proceedings, he has
never been arraigned, the purpose was not to legitimately
arrest him to charge him with a crime, but was for investiga"
tion, the court looks at the balancing and says that the
weight is on the wrong side here, this confession must be
excluded because it was obtained in violation of the Fourth
Amendment, despite the fact it was obtained pr'operly under
the Fifth and Sixth.
And what the New York Court of Appeals says is that
if you comply with the Fifth and Sixth, we will forget the
Fourth.

That is what. I submit that they have tried to do

xn this particular case.

And because they have tried to do

that, I respectfully submit that the judgment of the New York
x>urt, foe reversed, Judge Mark? s original decision after hearing

27
all the evidence in this case should in fact be reinstated,
the confession suppressed, and this judgment reversed.

Is there any authority for your theory

other than the Brown case?

Wong Sun.

MR. NOWAK:

Wong Sun.

Also the doctrine —*

Is it Wong Sun — I should have reread

Does that hold there can be a violation of

the Fourth without a violation of the Fifth?

Yes.
It does.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The parties have framed the issues in some

But the real issue, as I think, the bottom line issue,

is shall this concededly voluntary statement be suppressed?
And 1 would suggest that there are two separate theories,
separate theories but interrelated, why it should not and
why the statement is perfectly good as it is.
Rather obviously those two theories are expressed
in Brown v. Illinois

and the New York theory, which I will

refer to as the Morales theory for simplicity's sake, which
I think the Court now is aware of.
There are one or two preliminary factual matters
I would like to go into,

I think one of the things the

Court might be interested in is^Officer Luciano's part in
this whole episode.
From the appendix and the testimony, although we
make nothing of it in our statement in the briefs, you will
see that Officer Luciano was at headquarters or somewhere
nearby when he was told to go pick up the other two officers,
Mickelson and Ruvio, and he was ferrying them around.

It comes down to a question of the

whether- or not there was an illegal exploitation of the arrest
if it was illegal.
Now, if I understand what this Court told us in
Brown as an extension of Wong Sun, it has to be a balancing

In order for the rule to apply, you assume the initial

illegality, and for the purposes of argument we will do that
here.

Yes, your Honor, and I will tell you

After almost the moment he walked into the room he was

Mr. Dressier, did they give him a

is make a comparison between this case and the Brown test

and Adams and a few other cases, I am suggesting that the

illegality other than move him from one place to another —

that under such cases the two-pronged reasons

for excluding are not benefited.
If I understand the purpose of the exclusionary
rule, it is to protect the court's integrity so that they are

32
not using tainted evidence, and in addition having a
deterrent effect.
Under the facts of this case, it would, have no
deterrent effect because the police thought they were doing
what was allowed.

As a matter of fact, arguably to this

moment that is the law of New York, Morales found chat»
QUESTION:

That's not a Brown argument at all.

That’s not a Brown argument at all.

That's just an argument

that the exclusionary rule shouldn’t apply when the officers
have some subjective or objective basis, reasonable basis,
for doing what they did.

That isn’t an attenuation argument,

is it?
MR. BRESSLERs
QUESTION:

No, but,your Honor, I —

Did you present this argument to the

Appellate Division that even if it’s illegal or even if
there was no attenuation, the officers were nevertheless in
good faith and the evidence should not be excluded?

You

didn’t argue that, did you?
MR. BRESSLERs

I argued Morales in the New York

courts, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, Morales.

QUESTION:

You were the appellee and not the

appellant in the Appellate Division, were you not?
MR. BRESSLER:
time up.

No, we were the appellants the last

33
QUESTION:

Because the Supreme Court had suppressed

the co2ifession?
MR. BRESSLER;

Yes.

The trial court suppressed,

we appealed.
QUESTION;

You argue Morales only insofar as you

were saying this was legal under Morales.
MR. BRESSLER;

Well, of course, the question

before the Appellate Division was somewhat different than it
is now.

In the New York courts Morales is the law.

As a

matter of fact, the majority opinion rested mostly on those
grounds, also on Brown grounds.
There was a split.

Of course, we argued both.

There was four to one, one dissent,

three concurrences on the Morales theory and the Brown theory
c’nd a concurring opinion on Morales only.

That was Justice

v

Denman.
What I am saying is in exercising this balancing
test, one of the things I assume you would want to know is
.if suppression is to be had, will it benefit the purpose of
the exclusionary rule?

And I am saying that under the facts

of this case it will not, on two grounds;
In the first place, as I already strived to
indicate, there would be no deterrent effect if the police
reasonably believed they were following the law as it exists.
-u uoe testimony of the officer on the stand clearly indicates
that it does.

I think, as a matter of fact, I have it — ites

officer said he had the right to take him downtown.

The

"I did

not have probable cause to arrest him, I did have”

his words

— "probable cause to take him downtown," which was his way
of saying reasonable suspicion.
QUESTION;

Then in New York under Morales you don’t

ever need an arrest warrant?
MR. BRESSLERs

The way the law is in New York

today, that is correct, you do not, your Honor.
Now, speaking strictly to the question of
attentuation, if I understand Brown correctly, that, too, is
a balance of a different sort.

The extent of the necessary

attenuation to separate the statement from the presumed
illegality is always a question of fact, if I am correct.
I am suggesting that strictly under the theory espoused in
Brown, the good faith of the officers, the minimum time ,y the
lack of exploitation, the clearly voluntary nature of the
statement itself shows that there was a separation in his
mind when he made the statement as opposed to when he was
arrested, assuming again that there was an illegality.
There is a separate matter which I ask the Court
to consider as well.

Originally, after the defendant Dunaway

made his first statement, the police officer left.

Late

that afternoon or early evening, according to the testimony,
which was accepted, he asked to see the officers again, and

MR. BRESSLERs

However, I

would respectfully, your Honor, suggest that if there is
something wrong, if there is something oppressive about
being in a police station in an open room, there is something

45
even more oppressive —
QUESTION;

Open room*

MR. BRESSLER:

Is it an open room?

What I meari is a large room with a

desk ~
QUESTION:

It’s an open room?

MR. BRESSLER:

I didn't mean unlocked.

I do not

I am comparing the room to questioning him in

a police car, for example, which, if they had asked me, I
would have said it is outrageous, don't you dare do it.
Police cars, I think, are more inherently coercive than
rooms are.

That's a personal opinion, your Honor, obviously

not binding on anyone.
I think the real nub of the question is this:
If the police want to investigate this matter and they have
reasonable suspicion to believe that a certain individual
knows something about the crime, what they want is an
exchange of ideas.

They want communication.

You can't —■

if you stop people on the street, unfortunately in our
society in certain parts of town, all you are going to get is
an argument and a crowd.

Some people know whether they want

to talk to the police or not, they can't do it on their own,
if I can use the word, turf.
to use the language.

It's a put downy it's not cool,

They may be very willing to talk, willing

in the purest sense somewhere else, but not where they can be
seen, because they would lose face with their fellows and

their compatriots, the people with whom they have to live,
their peers, so to speak.
As a separate matter, it is not conducive to an
exchange of ideas.

Now, for example, contrast the questioning

of Dunaway with the questioning of Cole.

Cole was just as

much under suspicion when they questioned him.

And because

they were able to talk to him, he was able to convince them
that he knew nothing about it other than the hearsay, that is,
he did not participate.

H© was able to convince them that

he was innocent, and they went to the next step.
QUESTIONi

Cole was in jail.

MR. BRESSLERs

He was, your Honor.

Now, as a separate matter, although the question
has not yet arisen, one obvious argument along those lines,
your Honor, might be why they didn't go to Elmira.
Incidentally, I disagree that it was 90 miles.
I think it was closer to 120 miles.
The problem you have with going down to see
Hubert Adams is twofold.

In the first place, the information

that they had gave them no direct evidence concerning
Dunaway.

If they credit Cole's testimony, Cole's statement,

Cole heard from Hubert, who was the co-defendant Ronald "BaBa"'
brother, his older brother, the information he got from him
was that maybe a direct statement had been made to the
brother, but no direct statement had been made by Dunaway.

47
They would just have another layer of hearsay to contend
with.

No matter what Hubert Adams told them at Elmira, they

still had to go talk to Dunaway and they would be in no
better position than they were before they left.
Second of all, when you have someone who might

might want to protect Dunaway who was not his brother, anything
that he said, anything that Adams said, is immediately
suspect.

He might promise them anything, either to get his

brother off the hook or to get a better deal for himself or
a better jail assignment or parole time or whatever.
seems to me they mad® a practical decision.

It

And, of course,

"BaBa” was a juvenile, and I don’t think they knew where he
was.

My recollection of the record is that they were

looking for him, too.

It was just coincidence that they

found Dunaway first within a day or so.
It seems to me that the New York Court of Appeals
iried to develop a middle ground, a balancing test between
not investigating at all and taking a step further without
compromising the rights of privacy that everybody has under
-he Fourth Amendment.
If this case were very, very recent —
QUESTION

%

Say you have reasonable suspicion, may

you bring a person in against his will for fingerprinting?
MR. BKESSLERs

Well, if you have reasonable

3

suspicion, I cannot answer you directly, I don't think so»
But I would suggest that there you can get a warrant, because
there is provision for it»

There is no provision for a
s'.

warrant.
QUESTION:

How can you get a warrant on reasonable

suspicion?
MR, BRESSLER:

I believe that that is considered

less intrusive if you have — if I recall correctly in Davis
ihis Court condemned recmum procedures.

But it seems to me,

either between the lines or in dicta, there was an argument
that if they could show specifically that they were looking
:or this individual and for what reason, then maybe there
would be a method of legally but with judicial supervision
bringing him down to fingerprint him.
QUESTION *

Then maybe there would be probable cause»

MR. BRESSLER:

Well, I think the question posited

was that there was not probable cause.
QUESTION:

Just reasonable: suspicion.

MR. BRESSLER:
QUESTION:

Just reasonable suspicion.

I take it your court of appeals thinks

a person should be able to be — and you think -- should be
able fcc be briefly detained for certain purposes on less than
provable cause, merely reasonable suspicion.
MR. BRESSLER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

How about a lineup, calling him in for

50

a lineup based on reasonable suspicion but not on probable
cause?
MR. BRESSLER:

Well,, a lineup presents an altogether

different problem because with a lineup you have a live
witness, somebody who can identify him.

If you have a live

witness, there are other ways that you can make the same
identification.

So you can just bring him down and say, "Yes,

the;t3s the guy," would you have probable cause?
QUESTION?

You say you can just bring him down.

But. supposing he doesn't want to come?
MR. BRESSLER:

Forgive me, your Honor.

What I

mean was, assuming that I am a suspect, the reasonably
suspected person, bring the victim down and say, "Do you see
anybody you know,4' where you know the defendant — myself in
this c se -- would be, and he can say, "That's the guy."

Now

you have probable cause.
QUESTION:
problem?

But then don't you have a show-up

You get a show-up problem.
QUESTION:

As Justice Stevens says, suppose the

victim is somewhat fugacious, as a number of these — rather
the suspect is.

He isn't going to show up regularly at any

one place.
MR. BRESSLER:
guestion.

I am trying to answer your specific

My own opinion is that the New York courts would

lava more trouble for a lineup because you have a live witness

51
than when yon can’t have a lineup because there is no live
witness.
QUESTION?

I wouldn’t think they would have any

question with fingerprinting, though.
MR. BRESSLERs

You may be correct.

I am being a

little cautious about speculating because one of the things —
they have thrown these cases out.
What I started to say was that there has been
about a 10-year history of this precise rule in the State

of

New York, and during that 10 years there has been no
excessive police behavior, they haven’t used it, so to speak,
as a hole in the Fourth -amendment to swoop down and pick
people up.

They have not made any dragnets.

The court of

appeals and the intermediate appellate courts, and we have
cited some cases in our briefs, have carefully controlled
and supervised, there has been judicial supervision over this
proceeding.
QUESTIONS

Could I just ask this?

Do you therefore

interpret the rule as one that relates only to bringing a
suspect in for questioning and does not extend to bringing
him in for a lineup or for fingerprinting?

Or has the court

just not passed on the lineup and fingerprinting type
situation?
MR. BRESSLERs

The lineup cases have always found

a way to get a coart order, the ones I am familiar with.

So

52
the question has never been directly answered.

I dons t know

that they want to extend it any further, because you have
to remember that when you fingerprint

well, I guess he

could exculpate himself as well.
The real underlying theory behind Morales, as I
understand it, is to have a confrontation between the
suspect who may be a witness, as Cole was, so that h© himself
can be confronted with the question of whether h© wanes to
talk or not.

And they have said, under the controlled

conditions, a reasonably brief period where your Fourth
.Amendment rights are protected, that is reasonable.
have added another
QUESTIOKs

They

~
The question is are your Fourth

Amendment rights protected.
MR. BRESSLERs

That's the whole issue.

Well, they have said that under

chose circumstances, that is reasonable, and they have merely
added what I consider another dimension to the definition of
the word reasonable.

X guess the argument is in a ease where

you have no place else to go, where a serious crime has been
committed, that the balancing that is required between the
right

to privacy and the rights to solve these crimes, if it

can be done with a minimum of interference, should favor
investigation —
QUESTION?

I take it under the Morales case, if

you have the facts as in Terry, the police could not only have

53
stopped the gentleman for brief — they could have taken him
down to the station —
MR. BRESSLER:

No, 1 disagree, your Honor»

Because no crime has been committed.

What did they suspect

him of?
Secondly, it was not the type of crime that
couldn't be solved another way.
QUESTION s

A crime had been committed in Terry.

Carrying a weapon.
MR. BRESSLERs

I understand that, your Honor, but

that’s not the type of crime they are talking about.

They

are talking about a crime that has already been committed.
Every case that has reached the appellate courts where
v this issue was involved was a murder case where there was
no live witness.

They have never allowed it in any other

case, not the lower courts, not any court that I know of in
the State.

They have limited it strictly to murder cases

whcire in another case they said —
QUESTION;

Where there is some suspicion that the

person they are detaining is involved in the crime.
MR. BRESSLERs

Either as a witness or possibly as

a defendant, where they have reason to believe that he is
involved.
QUESTION;

Even a witness, then?

MR. BRESSLERs

Yes

54
QUESTIONS

Even .though they don't suspect him of

being a witness at all, just knowing something about it -*• I
mean,? suspect him of being the criminal^
MR. BRESSLER:

It5s so close, I don't know of a

case that separates it* because usually if you know about it,
you may be an accomplice, although perhaps not chargeable
with the full crime under investigation.
Certainly, for ©sample, Cole was in that
category.

They surely had the same reasonable suspicion

against him that they had against Dunaway after talking to
him.

He convinced them in his conversation he had with them

that he knew nothing about it.

Than he pointed them to

Adams and to Dunaway, or Axelrod, he called him by his
nickname.

*
QUESTION:

But in this case, I take it, we proceed

on the assumption that there is not probable cause to believe
that Dunaway was involved in the crime or that he knew
anything about it — probable cause.

There is less than

probable cause.
MR. BRESSLER;

That is correct.

That is conceded.

Thank you, your Honors.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD JOHN NOWAK

MR. NOWAK:

didn't know anything about why they were going out there, be
it for investigative purposes or whatever.

QUESTIONS
MR. NOWAKs

I think clearly

On page AS8 it does

being examined.

What page again?
A58, page 58 of the appendix, the

second answer from the bottom.

It states;

as much about the case as I did.”
people who went out to execute

“They knew just

Fantigrossi is saying that his
this arrest for investigatory

purposes knew just as much about the case as he did.

So for

the record I would like to clarify that.
Two brief points, and they are that respondent has
contested that New York applies this rule ~ has not been
excessive in the application of whatever rule they have
applied.

In my brief I have set out the case of People v,

Anderson

in which I was counsel for the defendant before the

C3urt of appeals wherein they struck down Mr. Anderson's
confession.

It was a murder case.

They struck it down.

He

was detained more than 18 hours by the police until he finally
confessed.

They noted in that case that the detention was

illegal.
QUESTION;

What8s your view on these facts?

Suppose

5G
the police had been carefully briefed on Morales and their
police procedures were keyed to Morales and that was the law
of the State of Hew York, it had never been overruled, but
then the case comes up here and Morales is overturned»

What

about procedures that had been carried on under Morales prior
to the overturning?
MR. NOWAK:

I think your question is the point

what if the police are acting in good faith when they are
trying to execute —
QUESTION:

Is there any difference between that

situation and when they are acting under a statute that is
presumably —
MR. NOWAK:

If we can presume, which I still would

contest that Morales is the law, then I would say that is a
factor to consider in possibly whether or not there is a
sufficient attenuation of the case»
QUESTION:

Wasn’t that theory completely rejected

in Airaeda Sanchez?
MR. NOWAK:

It was rejected in that “case as well

as, I believe, in -—
QUESTION:

There was a statute that expressly

allowed the search in that case.
MR. NOWAK:

That's correct.

But beyond that, good

xaith alone should not be an excuse of the Fourth Amendment.
I think this Court has repeatedly held that —

57
QUESTION:

In any event, that argument — this

particular kind of argument, I take it, wasn't made in the
State courts.
MR. NOWAK:

I don't believe that it was.

But even

if it was, as I am saying, what we are trying to prevent is
the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule.

My position

is that we should not make our citizens prove that they are
innocent to the police when they are only reasonably
suspected of criminal activity.

And that's what the

respondent here is trying to urge, that they can go to Cole
on reasonable suspicion, they can question him and make him
prove his innocence, but they don't have probable cause,
they can make our citizens prove, because it's a murder case,
it's serious, they can make our citizens prove by detaining
rhem and questioning them they didn't do it
reasonable.

and that's

And I submit that it is not reasonable, that

before we can

compel our citizens to be interrogated, which

.s the greatest form of deprivation of liberty, in police
headquarters, probable cause is required, and that should
be clear.

And I think the New York rule should be definitely

overturned in this case.
QUESTION:

At the police station, as I recall, he

drew some diagrams of the place where the crime had been
committed.
MR. NOWAK:

While he was confessing, they asked

58

him if he would show them what he means, and he did, and the
trial court as well said that had to be suppressed, its the
fruit of that illegal detention.

While he is confessing he

is drawing a diagram.
QUESTIOH:

Did I understand you in your argument in

chief to concede his statements and the drawing of the diagram
of the room were voluntary?
MR. NOWAK:

They were voluntary for purposes of the

Fifth Amendment in that they were voluntary because he was
read his rights and he waived them.
Fifth Amendment, yes.

For purposes of the

For purposes of the Fourth Amendment,

free will, I say no.
QUESTION:

One small question.

You would take the

same position, I take it, if they just asked him to get in
the police car, they made him get in the police car and they
questioned him right there?

That would be the same issue,

wouldn’t it?
MR. NOWAK:

I am not sure that it would.

He would

Le seized, and my position on behalf of the defendant would
ke yes, he is seized, they need probable cause.
QUESTION:

And they get the statement, of course,

It would still be the same sequence of events.
MR. NOWAK:
QUESTION:

As long as they made him get in the car.
To back, it up one stage more, suppose

standing on the sidewalk they began this conversation and then

59

gave him the Miranda warning and then he did there all the
things that he did downtown, what would be your answer there?
MR. NOWAK:

A whole different situation.

Possibly

that might be allowed depending on the nature of the seizure,
if it be reasonable.

There are a number of factors.

know if time would permit me to go into them.

I don’t

I think there

on the exact question you posited, that is, the nature of
the detention, it's on the street, not in police headquarters,
more beneficial, more reasonable for the police. What was
the length?

It’s brief, not long, not in the station house.

Are there any exigencies, which is a crucial element in
determining what’s reasonable under Terry.

The Court

specifically said the exigencies of a situation are what
control.

In Terry the police are trying to prohibit crime,

not solve it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is

up.

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was concluded.)
