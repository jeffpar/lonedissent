ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We’ll hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

My name is Richard Young, I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,

1 1

and I've been appointed by this Court to represent the Peti­

12

tioner in this case.

direction of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,

14

approximately 12 police officers armed with a variety of

15

shotguns, side arms and automatic weapons, spread-eagled the

16

Petitioner against his automobile in full view of a public

17

road and in front of his home.

then proceeded to conduct a room to room search of his house.

trying to make.

about the privacy of the American citizen, and evaluating

record?

MR. YOUNG:

Your Honor, I refer to it as his house

rather than calling it the premises in which he had a reason­

6

able expectation of privacy.

7

address; however, we believe that the record supports the

8

finding, if the government is entitled to raise that issue

at this late date, that indeed he did have a reasonable expec­

tation of privacy in the home.

Of that cocaine.

They did it, basically, Mr. Justice

whatever, and therefore no standing.

How did the government tie him then to

stuff they found in the house?

They did it with circumstantial evi­

elicit all the facts, but he --

QUESTION:

Well, don't bother.
5

I'll ask Mr. Frey.

1

MR. YOUNG:

All right, sir.

Thank you.

The

2

motion was denied on the basis that the agents who conducted

3

this search had an arrest warrant for an individual by the

4

name of Ricky Lyons, who they had reason to believe was lo­

5

cated in Petitioner's home.

6

basis of the Fifth Circuit case of The United States v.

7

Cravero, which it held that an arrest warrant, even without

8

exigent circumstances was a specific exception to the Fourth

9

Amendment search warrant requirement,

This ruling was made on the

if the officers had a

10

reasonable belief that the subject of the warrant could be

1 1

found inside the premises.

12

I want to call the Court's attention to two other

13

specific facts before I move directly to the issue.

14

call which was made by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent,

15

which assembled these 12 officers, was made at approximately

16

1 or 2 o'clock on the afternoon of January the 18th, prior

17

to the 5 o'clock search.

United States District Courthouse

there was nothing that prevented him from obtaining a search

warrant.

Secondly, when this platoon of agents arrived at

this house--there were two houses situated more or less next

door -- both houses were approached, only one house was

second house, the agent at the suppression hearing stated,

other house was referred to in the record -- "...was the same

as going to the house at the top of the hill.

QUESTION:

We didn't know

Now, at that time, what was -- who was

the object of their interest in their pursuit?
MR. YOUNG:
of their pursuit.

Allegedly -- well, no one was the object

Allegedly, Ricky Lyons was the object of

their interest, although, as I will explain, we believe there
is substantial doubt on the record that in fact they were
going there after Ricky Lyons, or if there were going after -QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

They did have an arrest warrant?
Yes sir.

Well they didn't have it,

but under federal law, it's not necessary that they have it.
There was one existing, but they didn't have it in their
possession.
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

Well, one was outstanding then?
Yes sir, there did exist an arrest

warrant for Ricky Lyons.

It had been issued in July of 1977,

as a consequence of a July '77 indictment which alleged acts
that had occurred in IS 73.
QUESTION:

It was a marijuana case.

And it's your position that in addition

to this arrest warrant for Ricky Lyons, and a reasonable
7

1

belief that Ricky Lyons was on the premises, they needed a

2

search warrant?

3

MR. YOUNG:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. YOUNG:

6

QUESTION:

In the absence of exigent circumstances?
Yes.
Precisely my position.
All right, just what would one have told

7

one of the magistrates on duty in Atlanta, in order to obtain

8

the search warrant for -- going on the premises of your client

9

to arrest Ricky Lyons?

10

MR. YOUNG:

He would have told the magistrate, first

11

under oath, that he had obtained information from a reliable

12

confidential informer, upon whom he had relied successfully

13

in the past, and that the information was credible, and that

14

the information consisted of this:

15

the DEA agent with a phone number where he -- where the

16

informant said,

17

partner in the drug business, Jimmy, could be found within a

18

pertinent, period of time.

19

that because he heard, he talked to him on the phone, he

20

was given that phone number as to where Jimmy was, and he

21

overheard Ricky's voice in the background.

22

of course?, traced the address through the phone company, and

23

that's all the agent would have had to have told the magis­

24

trate, in order for that magistrate to make the determination

25

that Petitioner's right of privacy would have to yield to

the informant provided

Ricky Lyons and his partner, Jimmy, his

He told the agent that he knew

8

The agents then,

2

magistrate never had that opportunity; the police made this

3

judgment on their own.

QUESTION:

8
9
10

You concede that would have been enough,

had the search warrant been based on that --

6
7

However, the

MR. YOUNG:

Had the search warrant been -- well,

for purposes of this appeal, it is assumed there was probable
c ause or at least reasonable belief to belief that Lyons was
there.
QUESTION:

Well there really isn't a great deal

1 1

that a law enforcement officer, who has an outstanding arrest

12

warrant and believes that the subject of the warrant is on

13

someone else's premises, can tell a magistrate if he's seeking

14

a search warrant of the premises in addition to the kind of

15

information that you're talking about, is there?

16

know anything about the premises at all.

17

MR. YOUNG:

That's true.

He may not

However, it's our position

18

that the issue is not so much how much he would have to tell

19

the magistrate, but rather, the need of the magistrate to

20

stand between him and the privacy rights of the Petitioner in

21

the absence of exigent circumstances.

22

That's our position.

And we contend, as Your Honor

23

has noted, that there must be a search warrant in this case,

24

and we -- or, in these circumstances.

25

notion that the Fourth Amendment contains two basic principles
9

And we begin with a

1

And one is, which apparently this case met for the purposes

2

of this appeal, that there is probable cause to believe that

3

the object or the person which the police are seeking is

4

contained in the place they want to search.

5

6

QUESTION:

in fact have the arrest warrant on them?

7

8

Now Mr. Young, did you say they did not

MR. YOUNG:

No sir.

And in fact, nobody, none of

these agents had even ever seen --

9

QUESTION:

No, but they were acting on the author­

10

ity of the arrest warrant, weren't they, when they made the

1 1

entry?

12

MR. YOUNG:

13

QUESTION:

14

They were, precisely; yes sir.
Does it make any different whether they

had it in their pockets , or not?

15

MR. YOUNG:

16

QUESTION:

No sir, no.

Not under federal law.

No sense spending time on that.

Now,

17

you've referred to the exigent circumstances, Mr. Young.

18

Suppose, instead of having all these advance preparations,

19

they had been literally pursuing Lyons, and followed him on

20

foot and they saw him dart into this house, could they have

21

22
23
24
25

followed him?
MR. YOUNG:

Certainly, Your Honor.

Under Warden

v. Hayden, that's hot pursuit and this Court permits that.
QUESTION:

After they got in the house, if they

saw marijuana or other contraband in plain view, could they
10

1

seize it?

2
3

MR. YOUNG:
could.

That is an exigent circum­

stance --

Yes sir, under Warden v. Hayden, they

QUESTION:

From his point of view, the occupant of

the house, whatever his right to be there may be, from his
point of view, why is it different whether the police got in
there by

-- the agents got in there in hot pursuit, or got

in there in cold, deliberate steps?
MR. YOUNG:

From his point of view, Your Honor, it

is that he has the right and the need, and this country has
the right and the need, for an individual's expectation of
privacy not to yield on the basis of the judgment of the

police, but on the basis of the judgment of a neutral and
detached magistrate.

The reason that a magistrate is inter­

posed was most succinctly said by Mr. Justice Douglas in
McDonald v. United States, when he said "power is a heady
thing, and the police acting on their own cannot be trusted".
That is what is important, is that magistrate, in the absence
of an exigent circumstance such as hot pursuit, as you
indicated, must stand between the police and the citizen.
QUESTION:
concede that he'd be

But from his point of view, I take it, yo a
in a very different position
11

from the

1

hot pursuit situation, he would have no basis for having the

2

evidence, the plain view evidence rejected?

3

HR. YOUNG:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Of course,

4

the determination of probable cause, and the need to invade

5

the citizen's privacy, Petitioner's privacy, must be made

6

prior to the search.

7

only by the police.

8

QUESTION:

9

And in this case, of course, it was made
This -Now by hypothesis, what do you, if I may

press this one on you, what should they have done:

surrounded

10

the house, since they had adequate manpower, and sent one of

1 1

the agents down to get the warrant?

12

MR. YOUNG:

No sir, when Agent Goodowens called to

13

assemble this raiding party, he should have taken five minutes

14

and gone next door and talked to the magistrate and gotten

15

a search warrant.

16

QUESTION:

Well, would it have been adequate if --

17

he, having failed to do that and arriving at the house, could

18

they have secured the premises in the sense of surrounding it,

19

and then got the warrant?

20

MR. YOUNG:

21

QUESTION:

22

Certainly.
Would you say, that was the fallback

position they should have carried out --

23

MR. YOUNG:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. YOUNG:

Yes sir.
-- not having -That's a fallback position they could
12

1

have carried out.
QUESTION:

2

Assuming, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist

3

suggested, they had enough to present to the magistrate to

4

persuade him to issue the warrant, the search warrant?

5

MR. YOUNG:

6

QUESTION:

7

the arrest warrant?
MR. YOUNG:

8
9
10

Correct.
The search warrant necessary to execute

The search warrant necessary to give

them the right to enter Petitioner's home in order to execute
that arrest warrant.
QUESTION:

1 1

You know, I have to raise the point that,

12

I have been listening carefully but I have great difficulty

13

in putting all this together until I find out on what basis

14

you say that that's his home, emphasis his underscored.

15

MR. YOUNG:

16

QUESTION:

17

All right, sir.
It really was the Gaultney's place of

residence, wasn't it?
MR. YOUNG:

18

No sir, it was leased by the Smiths, or

19

by Mr. Smith, who was the individual who was arrested as he

20

came into the house and arrived in a truck.

21

QUESTION:

I think we'd all feel better if you'd

22

call it the home, rather than his, because that issue is

23

still --

24
25

MR. YOUNG:

All right.

Well, let me go ahead and

address the standing issue at this time, and insofar as it is
13

1

2

properly before this Court.
We believe that the standing issue is not before

3

this Court and would urge the Court not to take the govern­

4

ment's invitation to remand this case in order to determine

5

if Petitioner has a standing under the more recent case of

6

United States v. Salvucci.

7

Rakas v. Illinois was decided in December of 1978, which

8

clearly delineated the notion that standing is a function of

9

an expectation of privacy.

And our reason for this is that

Briefs in the Fifth Circuit in

10

this case, by the Appellant and the government were not filed

1 1

until 1979, so not only did the government have ample oppor­

12

tunity to ask the Fifth Circuit to remand or to -- remand for

13

standing or to decide the Petitioner didn't have standing.

14

But moreover, they could have raised it, of course, at the

15

trial level.

16

Salvucci raised his standing argument from the

17

very beginning, and of course Salvucci eventually overruled

18

the automatic standing requirement of Jones.

19

says that because we were all proceeding under Jones, that

20

this Court should reevaluate the case in light of Salvucci,

21

we say the government made a tactical decision.

22

Circuit, they had Rakas to stand on, and they could have

23

asked that the case be remanded; they didn't.

24

the record that they didn't, because they knew that they

25

had Cravero in their hip pocket.
14

The government

In the Fifth

We infer from

1

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Young, I take it, whether or

2

not the government's omission to raise this below precludes

3

their being heard on it here, is at least in part, isn't it,

4

dependent upon whether or not this standing question is juris­

5

dictional?

6

MR. YOUNG:

7

QUESTION:

That may well be, Your Honor.
If it's in fact jurisdictional, and thus

8

I expect they may raise it here and say you can't do it

9

because you have no jurisdiction here, could that be it?

10

MR. YOUNG:

That -- it could be.

1 1

QUESTION:

Well now, what is it?

What's the dis­

12

tinction between prudential and jurisdictional; as I noted,

13

Salvucci, you'll recall, refers to it as Fourth Amendment

14

standing --I don't know what that means.

15

MR. YOUNG:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. YOUNG:

I

18

20

22
23
24
25

I think that-

Perhaps no one does -I'm not -- I would be speculating, I

think it's very difficult to tell.

19

21

Well I'm not sure I know.

QUESTION:

Do you think this is jurisdictional?

MR. YOUNG:

Your Honor, I really haven't given

that -- I haven't evaluated that aspect of it.
on standing is that it was simply,

Our position

it was waived by the

government below and it was waived on the basis of a

tactical

decision.
QUESTION:

Well, except that what I'm suggesting is,
15

1

2
3
4

5

6

they didn't raise it and they maybe deliberately didn't raise
it.

But if it is jurisdictional, doesn't that mean we can't

hear them here, even though they deliberately did not raise
it below?
MR. YOUNG:
I can't answer that.

I can't answer that, Your Honor.
However, we also contend that from the

7

record, there are -- there is enough evidence to reasonably
8

infer an expectation of privacy under Salvucci, even under

9

the stricter

standard of Salvucci, and we point to the

10

fact that the confidential informant stated that there were
1 1

four or five people staying there.

We infer that that is

12

Gaultney and his wife, who, the record indicates, were stay­
13

ing in the front bedroom; Smith and his wife, who, the
14

record doesn't indicate where they were staying, but it indi­
15

cates that he had leased the place, and Steagald.
16

Second, Steagald was out front of the house in his
17

shirt sleeves on a wintry January afternoon, his sweater which
18

he knew exactly where it was, was found in the house.

Third,

19

he had papers of his in the house, and fourth, -20

QUESTION:

Are those the checks, or something?

21

MR. YOUNG:

Yes sir, two checks and an invoice.

22

QUESTION:

Two checks.

23

MR. YOUNG:

Two checks and an invoice.

And fourth,

24

the automobile out front, we believe, might be reasonably
25

inferred to be his automobile inasmuch as the trial transcript

QUESTION:

6

8
9
10
1 1

MR. YOUNG:

14

Oh.
Inasmuch as the record indicates that

Steagald had an old, beat-up Volkswagen.

Now any one of

these factors taken by itself is not going to give Petitioner
a reasonable expectation of privacy of his home, I don't
contend that.

But these facts taken together, we believe,

give rise to that inference.

12
13

He was -- there was apparently something

wrong with the engine, Your Honor; they were looking at the

5

7

Was he washing it or cleaning it?

QUESTION:

Mr. Young, on the -- I don't want you

to go into the facts in great detail, but you indicated
before that the proof of the substantive offense itself was

15

largely circumstantial.
16
17

Was the -- Steagald's connection

with the place in which a lot of these things were found,
one of the circumstances on which the government relied to

18

establish guilt?
19

MR. YOUNG:
20
21

The way that they — I contended at

trial that his connection with the house was too tenuous
to even get to the jury, to withstand the judgment of acquittal

22

motion.

The government argued, in response to that and to

23

the jury, once it got to the jury, that the fact that his
24

sweater was there, the fact that these papers were there, the
25

fact that his car was out front, these facts that I have just
17

1

2
3

elicited, to rely on alleging a reasonable expectation of
privacy, the government relied upon -- to place him connected
to that house --

Honor.

That was part of the evidence, Your

There was a -- the Court has to understand that,

prior to this search, the -- there was evidence which the
government introduced that involved a number of contacts that
Steagald had, where the import company that it was proved had
moved the drugs from the airport to a warehouse, he rented the
warehouse, he set up an answering service for the import
company, all these type of circumstantial contacts with the
merchandise in which this cocaine was concealed.

So the

government relied upon that, and then the government relied
upon the various evidentiary inferences to which it was
entitled from those four or five facts that I have just
mentioned, concerning his connection with the house in which
the cocaine was ultimately found.
So we say that -- that the Court should find -QUESTION:

So at least to that extent, I gather
18

there was a case or controversy between the government and

of privacy in the entire premises.

MR. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

MR. YOUNG:

And the government says for that reason

Yes sir.
So what do we do, toss a coin?
No sir, you find that the government

7

has waived it, at least that's what I urge

8

Now another issue that the government raises --- before I

9

get to the next issue the government has raised, let me say

the Court to do.

10

that our position on the arrest warrant is this ; that the

11

arrest warrant affords no protection, indeed in its issuance

12

it doesn't even take into consideration the expectation of

13

privacy of the third party -- consequently the arrest

14

is simply not sufficient and it makes no difference whether

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

warrant

the search is for a person or a thing, since the intrusion
is the same..

So we say that the government had to have a

search warrant.
Now the government also raises , again for the first
time in this Court, the argument that because Cravero -United States v. Cravero -- was the law in the Fifth Circuit
at the time of this search -- that this Court should as I
understand their argument, adopt a good faith exception to
the exclusionary rule and hold that the agents in this case
were acting in good faith, in reliance upon Cravero.

We

say in response to that, first, there is substantial doubt
21

1

from this record that the governments were in fact acting

2

in good faith.

3

that they were going to find 1500 pounds of marijuana in this

4

house and that was their first interest.

5

these facts in the record:

6

said that there had been a drug deal in Florida recently con­

7

summated by Ricky Lyons and this individual named Jimmy,

8

that Jimmy had attempted to sell cocaine, a matter of days or

9

a week prior to the conversation that he had in early January

10

We believe that the government agents believed

the confidential informant had

with the Drug Enforcement agent --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. YOUNG:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. YOUNG:

Is Jimmy the Petitioner?
No sir, Jimmy is Ricky Lyons' partner.
I see.
All right.

When the confidential

15

informant first told the Drug Enforcement agent about the

16

attempt by Jimmy to sell him cocaine, the agent's first

17

response was not to find Ricky Lyons, was not to get that

18

information, but was to try to prevail upon the confidential

19

informant to set up a drug deal with Jimmy and have this

20

one go through.

21

evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress as to whether

22

or not it was his impression from the confidential informant

23
24

25

Second, that same agent testified at the

that the house where Ricky Lyons was, was a "stash house
for narcotics".

He answered, I asked him that, if he knew

there was going to be any dope there, he says they always

had dope around.

I said do you know if there's going to be

any there, he said well I don't know, but they deal in it,
they might have.

And that's in Volume II of the suppression

hearing at page 47.
Moreover, Agent Goodowens testified -- who was one
of the Drug Enforcement Administration agents -- testified
that the confidential informant believed that there would be
drugs there, but that he didn't have it on what the agent
called hard information, in other words, the government agent
did not have sufficiently hard information to get a search
warrant for drugs, but they believed that drugs would be there
Finally, a

Gwinnett

County police officer,

which is the county in Georgia where this house was located,
testified that one of the Drug Enforcement Administration
agents had told him when the agent first called him to
organize this raid, that he had information there might be
a quantity of marijuana in this house and he testified that
to the best of his recollection the agent told him 1500 pounds
Finally, after the quick, first search of this
house, when the agent came back outside to report what he
had found to the other agents, he did not say, as they were
looking for this armed and dangerous Ricky Lyons, no luck,
Ricky Lyons isn't here.

He said, I think I found some cocaine

We believe, Your Honors, that there is substantial doubt in
the record that they were acting in good faith; indeed, we
23

1

believe there is a great likelihood that the agents in this

2

case did exactly what Cravero gives them an incentive to do,

3

and that is, they used an arrest warrant to circumvent the

4

search warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Young, ordinarily.this Court does

6

not canvass volumes of records to determine motivation where

7

two courts have found something sufficient.

8

challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, are you?

9

MR. YOUNG:

No, Your Honor.

You are not

No sir.

Secondly,

10

on the good faith argument, in order to apply a good faith

1 1

exception here in this case the Court would have to avoid

12

reaching

13

Article III, of course, would prevent this Court from finding

14

that a search warrant is necessary in these circumstances, but

15

it's not -- and will be necessary from now on, but it's not

16

necessary to apply the exclusionary rule in this case because

17

the government was acting in good faith.

18

as mere dictum.

19

exclusionary rule to Petitioner's case by adopting some sort

20

of a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, the

21

Court would have to avoid the central issue in this case.

22

We urge the Court not to do that, the question has evaded

23

review for quite some time; it was characterized as a grave

24

constitutional issue as long ago as 1958 in Jones v. United

25

States, and the Cravero rule or its equivalent, is used by

the actual issue it has taken certiorari on.

That would stand

Therefore, an order to avoid applying the

24

1

2
3

a number of the Circuits — it is not used by others, the
states are split on the use of it, as are the commentators.
But we believe the Court should address that issue.

Mr. Young, I notice in your brief --

QUESTION:

Did we give a limited grant of cer­

Or was that the only question you were -MR. YOUNG:

No, two questions were presented.

The

second question was whether or not there was probable cause
to believe Ricky Lyons could be found in this house -QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

On that we did not grant certiorari?
No sir.

Cert was denied on that and

granted on this question.
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

On this single question?
On that single issue, yes.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Young, may I ask you two questions?

First, is it correct that the reasonable belief standard of
the Fifth Circuit is the same as the probable cause standard?
MR. YOUNG:

No, Your Honor.

It is not.

The

Cravero says that reasonable belief embodies the same standard
of reasonableness as probable cause, but simply gives the
police -- or permits the police to avoid a second trip to
25

1

the magistrate, in other words, having been there once to

2

get the arrest warrant.

3

QUESTION:

Right, I read that.

That to me, implies

4

that they had to have what would have been necessary to

5

convince the magistrate.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

Which would have been probable cause;

8

it wouldn't do any good to go to the magistrate with something

9

less than probable cause, because you wouldn't get the search

10

warrant.

11

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24

25

MR. YOUNG:

Well, but Your Honor, we say that

probable cause is -- goes hand in hand with one of two
things:

a magistrate, or exigent circumstances.

And in this

case, or in Cravero, since the Court, permits a finding of
probable cause without exigent circumstances and without a
magistrate, that is why they have called it something of a
lesser standard, namely reasonable belief.

It is also the

authority upon which Cravero relies, is really a strain of
authority from the previously discredited Rabinowitz decision
that also dealt in terms of a reasonable belief standard.
And we believe that reasonable belief is something less
than probable cause.
QUESTION: Well you'd make the same basic argument
even if it were the same, though, I take it, that there's
still a warrant required?
26

1

MR. YOUNG:

2

QUESTION:

Yes sir.

I would.

On the basic argument, the government

3

says that the common law is against you, and I don't think

4

you respond to that; do you concede they correctly interpret

5

the common law?

6

MR. YOUNG:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, having read

7

several of the cases upon which the government relies, we

8

say that there are two significant errors in the government's

9

analysis of those cases.

And the first is, that for example

10

in -- I think it's Semayne's Case, Lord Coke

1 1

a situation where the house which is entered is the defen­

12

dant's house himself, not a third party's house.

13

in the Semayne's Case, Lord Coke

14

upon the rationale for his decision in that case, which was

15

a civil case incidentally.

16

the type of arrest that occurred in this case would be per­

17

mitted, and it was a hot pursuit example.

18

Warden v. Hayden, decided in 1967.

19

is addressing

Moreover,

is somewhat elaborating

And he gives an example in which

It's a straight

Finally of course, because of the reverence of

20

common law for the sanctity of the privacy of an individual's

21

home as opposed to the right of privacy in other situations,

22

we believe that the common law did not permit this type of

23

search and if -- but in any event, or at the very least, it

24

is unclear whether the common law did or not.

25

the arrest rules of common law arose in the context of
27

Additionally,

1

usually civil damage suits or either false arrest or tres­

3

as the government says they are -- they are not directly

4

applicable to the situation we are dealing with.

5

officer's authority to enter was generally established in

6

cases where he was being sued and that was his defense, that

7

he had the authority to enter.

8
9

And consequently, they are not -- even if they are

And the

And finally, of course, as this Court noted just
last term, in Payton v. New York, this Court does not simply

10

freeze into constitutional law, law enforcement practices

11

that existed at the time the Fourth Amendment was enacted.

I'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, thank

13

you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20

I think you've used all

MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

This case presents three distinct issues to the

Court:

25

cabin so that he is entitled to raise the substantive Fourth

the first is whether Petitioner's legitimate expec­

Amendment issue.

2

decline to consider the substantive Fourth Amendment issue

3

in this case as a matter of exclusionary rule, and retro­

4

activity policy. And the third, if the Court reaches the issue

5

is whether an arrest warrant plus reason to believe or prob­

6

able cause to believe the subject of the warrant is on the

7

premises suffices to justify an entry into third party pre­

8

mises to execute the arrest warrant.

20

With the Court's permission, I will treat these
issues in the order I have listed them.

23
24

25

First, with respect

to what I hope Justice Rehnquist will give me the liberty of
ailing the standing issue, this is essentially offered to
this Court as an alternative ground for affirmance.

We do

not in fact suggest affirmance on this ground, although we
think the record would permit it, but, in light of what the
Court did in Combs and what the Court did last term in
Salvucci, and the fact that there was no focus on the issue
of Petitioner's expectation of privacy in the cabin, we
think fairness would justify giving him an opportunity to
demonstrate that on a remand.

21

22

The second is whether the Court should

However --

Excuse me?

QUESTION:

the issue, since you never raised it before?
29

1

MR. FREY:

Well, let me say first of all that we

2

do not contend that the issue is jurisdictional.

3

standing in the constitutional case or controversy sense,

4

so we do not say that the Court is required to consider the

5

issue on that --

QUESTION:

Well why should we, when you didn't raise

MR. FREY:

Now, there are two separate questions:

This is not

one is, are we entitled to raise it in this Court; and the

10

second question is, if we are entitled to raise it, must the

Well, --

QUESTION:

We never admit we do --

MR. FREY:

Let me just cite the Court three cases

in which points which are pertinent to this are made, quite
briefly.

In the New York Telephone Company case, 434 U.S. at

166, Note A, the Court said the prevailing party may defend
the judgment on any ground which the law and the record
30

permit, that would not expand the relief that has been grantee

MR. FREY:

But that falls considerably short of

saying that the Court has to consider --

it, that it is not ordinarily so qualified.

But don't ordinarily, we qualify that,

In Dandridge against Williams, the Court said the prevailing

16

relied upon or even considered by the trial court.

17

may of course assert in a reviewing court, any ground

But Mr. Frey, you'd really get a differ­

MR. FREY:

Well that's all -- this would be a ground

21

for affirming the conviction and

22

motion.

I thought you said earlier that you

24

thought the proper disposition would be to send it back for

25

another hearing to give them an opportunity to establish -31

MR. FREY:

Well let me get to that in a second.

2

If I can just mention the third case, which is Bondholders

3

Committee against Commissioner, 315 U.S., and this is at 192,

4

the Court said that though Respondent apparently did not

5

urge this point before the Board or the Court below, it

6

may of course support the judgment here by any matter appear­

7

ing in the record.

8
9

Now, our position, Mr. Justice Stevens, is that this
record contains no evidence sufficient to support -- for the

10

Petitioner to carry his burden of demonstrating that he had

11

a legitimate expectation of privacy in the cabin.

12

course not saying that he was a trespasser on the premises;

13

what we are saying is that he was outside at the time the

14

entry was made, there is no indication other than counsel's

15

surmise, nothing in the record that he lived in the cabin,

16

he was not the lessee --

17
18

QUESTION:

MR. FREY:

23
24
25

Yes, there are indications, including

the cocaine, that he was present --

21

22

Well what about the checks and the

sweater and those other things?

We're of

QUESTION:

that Payton was decided -- he does not dispute that Payton
is a ...case that should not be applied retroactively to arrest
entries into the defendant's or suspect's•own premises,

altered the settled law of the Fifth Circuit on the Payton
issue and the opinion itself in Payton stated that the practice

practice.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Frey,

in this argument are you

2

essentially arguing that in the Payton case we should have

3

not applied the Payton rule to Payton?
MR. FREY:

4

I will come to that point, because we

5

have tried to be careful not to argue that and I will explain

6

that point.
The complication in this case arises from the

7

8

fact that the substantive Fourth Amendment issue presented

9

here, while closely related to the issues presented in Payton,

10

nevertheless is not clearly controlled by it.

That is, it

1 1

is still possible that the government could win this case

12

even though the state lost Payton.

13

Now, this fact, standing alone, does not justify

14

reaching the issue in the case of a search that took place

15

prior to the decision in Payton.

16

do the very thing that this Court criticized the Court of

17

Appeals for doing in the Bowen case.

18

this Court declined to do in Stovall and DeStefano and in

19

Payne

20

mined that a decision is not retroactive, to go on and con­

21

sider a ramification of that decision.

22

priate and the Court in Bowen, suggested that several reasons

23

why the practice would not be done, including the Court's

24

reluctance to decide constitutional issues unnecessarily.

25

Now, let me acknowledge that this case is different from

To do that would be to

those other cases in one respect:

in Bowen, if the govern­

ment had won Almeida-Sanchez, Bowen would have had no claim
whatsoever, his claim was a lesser included claim than had
been Almeida-Sanchez's claim -- the same is true of almost
all of those other cases, although with one exception that
I'll get to in a moment.

Here it is possible that the state

could have won Payton, I believe, and that the courts could
nevertheless have concluded that Petitioner's position on the
issue of third party entries is sound.

Now Petitioner's

argument in his reply brief is that -- and it's the point
that you were making about Payton -- that if the government
is simply making a good faith argument, then the Court will
never decide the issue that the police officers , and the Drug
Enforcement Administration agents and so on and the Fifth
Circuit, will continually be able to point to the Cravero
decision and the Court will continually, as he construes our
argument, be forced to say, although it's a matter of exclus­
ionary rule policy, we won't reach the substantive consti­
tutional issue.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, so far this sounds like some­

thing out of St. Thomas Aquinas; perhaps it's our fault rather
than yours that it does, but we granted certiorari on a
particular question, and I would have expected to hear argu­
ment on that question, first.
MR. FREY:

Petitioner did not dispute our historical argument, and I'm
sure the law clerks can do much better than I can in the
time available, in digging into these -- the esoteric of it.
If you will look at the passage of Coke that we cite, you
will see that the discussion is talking about any man's house,
or the house of any person, and is not, I think, contemplating
simply the house of the subject of the warrant.

And Coke does

say, -- it's an authority that was greatly relied on by the
Court in Payton -- that, at least after indictment, and this
case was a warrant issued after indictment, the arrest
warrant does constitute authority to break into any man's
home.
QUESTION:

May I ask a question?

Assuming I owned

a home in Atlanta, you could use that warrant to break into
my house tonight?
MR. FREY:

Excuse me?

QUESTION:

Assuming I owned a home in Atlanta,

Georgia, -MR. FREY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

and break into my house?

subject of the warrant was present in the house.

If the police said that, right?

MR. FREY

Let me just, I'd like to pass on from

the history point.

8

QUESTION

9

You could break into my house?

Well let me ask you one question on

the history, because it really carries right down to date.

10

The quotation from Semayne that you have on page 38 of your

1 1

brief, says the house of anyone is not a castle or privilege,

12

but for himself, and shall not extend to protect any person

13

who flies to his house or the goods of any other which are

14

brought and conveyed into his house.

15

your position apply also to going into getting a gun, say,

16

that the suspect --

MR. FREY:

No.

QUESTION:

Let's say you had a search warrant

Well,

Now does your -- would

19

for the gun in the owner's house, and also an arrest warrant

20

for the owner, and he takes his gun to the house but he's

21

not there; can you break in to get the gun?

22

HR. FREY:

No, of course not.

We're not relying on

23

Semayne's case for every possible implication that

24

conceivably be dredged out.

25

QUESTION:

Why not?

could

And if you had the arrest -42

1

if you had the search warrant and you have probable cause

2

to believe the gun is there, why doesn't the reasoning -- why

3

wouldn't your reasoning apply there?

6

MR. FREY:

You mean, why wouldn't -- if Semayne's

case were the history -QUESTION:

Oh forget Semayne's case.

Just should

7

; there would be a distinction between the -- a search for a

8

person and search for property in terms of breaking into a

9

third party's house?

10
11

MR. FREY:

That would be the substance of my argu­

ment as to whether they should or they shouldn't.

12

QUESTION:

All right.

13

MR. FREY:

And as to the role of history, of course,

14

there's much room for debate about what role history ought to

15

play in a decision of this sort, it seems to me there is a

16

limit beyond which the Fourth Amendment ought not to be

17

construed to bar practices that were clearly permissible in

18

common law, but this is a case which I concede is not as clear

19

as Watson was, let's say, on the history.

20

point aside and considering the matter from the standpoint of

21

logic and policy, the argument is not all one-sided.

22

grant that there will be some cases in which a search warrant

23

requirement would be useful in interposing a magistrate and

24

preventing overzealous police officers from unreasonably

25

invading third party premises.

Now laying this

Now, we

in context.

2

mises and not the residence of the individual named in the

3

warrant, we are dealing with a class of cases in which, by

4

definition, the connection of the suspect to the premises is

5

likely to be brief or transitory.

6

proportion of this class of cases will involve exigent cir­

7

cumstances or at least circumstances in which recourse to

the warrant procedure with the delays it often entails, will

Because we are talking about third party pre­

Accordingly, a much higher

What I'm saying is that the benefits

that we may reasonably expect to reap from the imposition of
a search warrant requirement, are considerably diminished
as against those which could have been anticipated from the
decision in Payton.
With the weight on one side of the scale thus
diminished, it seems to us a questionable conclusion that an
arrest entry by officers armed with an arrest warrant and
possessing sufficient reason to believe the subject of the
warrant is on the premises, is unreasonable under the Fourth
Amendment unless they also possess a search warrant.
Now let me summarize the factors that favor con­
tinued adherence to the common law rule that an arrest warrant
suffices to enter any premises in which the suspect is reason­
ably believed to be located.
First, the arrest warrant means that the magistrate

has determined one of the elements required to be determined
by the warrant clause; that is, he has determined that there
is probable cause to seize the person named in the arrest
warrant.

We concede of course that he has not determined that

the person named in the arrest warrant is on the premises to
which entry is to be made.

And I think that the case is

weaker than Payton; that is, Payton's conclusion that an
arrest warrant sufficed to enter into the premises of the
individual named in the arrest warrant, rests on stronger
grounds because of the greater likelihood that the individual
will in fact be on his premises, and because of the fact that
there are no general warrant problems associated with treating
the arrest warrant as a power to enter into premises -QUESTION:

Well under a general warrant, it does

give them the right to go into any premises that he -- which
means any officer in Atlanta, assumes or has reasonable belief
that that man is in there -- he makes the decision as to the
house that will

be searched, not the magistrate.

I think --

MR. FREY:

Well, --

QUESTION:

-- I think that's the problem.

MR. FREY:

-- he makes the original decision, but

of course, he must have this reason to believe, the decision
is subject to a post-entry judicial scrutiny in connection
either with a suppression hearing or a civil damages suit,
this is not simply the uncontrolled discretion of the officer.
45

1

Now, I understand, and I could hardly argue other­

2

wise, that all of the Court’s warrant clause cases acknowledge

3

that there is a value in having the magistrate look at the

4

matter.

What we are saying is that the class --

19

Frey, that it would be more difficult and in some cases,

impossible, to comply with the Fourth Amendment's requirement

22

described?

MR. FREY:

-- in non-exigent cases, to describe
I don't think that that would be a problen.

But I do think that the points that Mr. Justice
White made in his dissent, in Payton, carried perhaps.more force
although they were not persuasive to a majority of the Court
in Payton -- they are carrying more force here, because
of this difference in the balance.

The intrusion that's

entailed in an arrest entry, while significant, is still very
much less substantial than the intrusion that is entailed
in an entry to seize books or records, to search for narcotics
48

1

or other kinds of things that would involve rummaging through

2

papers, desk drawers, and other customary repositories of

3

privacy.

4
5

QUESTION:

You mean you don't generally look for

a person in a desk drawer?

6

MR. FREY:

I would say not.

And finally, I think

7

that Justice White expressed in his dissent in Payton, a

8

concern about the difficulty of having the police make this

9

very, often very subtle judgment about what constitutes

10

exigent circumstances, and he suggested that the common law

1 1

rule that he and those who joined with him, thought should be

12

retained, was an easier rule for the police to administer.

13

Now, that may not have been sufficiently persuasive

14

in the context of Payton, because after all, in Payton there

15

had not even been any determination that the individual who

16

the officers — any magisterial determination that the indi­

17

vidual who the officers were seeking was in fact subject to
