ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

8

MR. LEVY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

10

United States Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.

1 1

question presented by our petition is. whether the Comptroller

12

General of the United States in discharging the statutory

13

responsibility to determine the reasonableness of the price

14

charged the Government in a negotiated contract is authorized

15

by law to examine records of a contractor's unallocated costs

16

that are an integral and significant part of a contractor's

17

business and are defrayed from funds that include the Govern­

18

ment's payments under the contract.

19

The sole

The relevant facts are straightforward and uncon­

20

tested.

21

entered into three contracts with the Department of Defense

22

and into one contract with the Veterans Administration for

23

the sale of pharmaceutical products to the Government.

24

four were negotiated fixed price contracts for the total

25

price of approximately $2 million.

In 1973 and 1974 respondent Bristol Laboratories

3

All

As required by 10 USC 2313(b) and 41 USC 254(c)

1

2

each of the contracts contained a standard access-to-records

3

clause in which respondent agreed that the Comptroller

4

General shall have access to and right to examine any direct­

5

ly pertinent books and records of respondent.involving

6

transactions related to the contract.
Pursuant to these statutory and contractual provi­

7

8

sions, the Comptroller General in August, 1974, made a timely

9

request to respondent for access to all books and records

10

directly pertinent to the contracts, including records of

11

experienced costs, support for the prices charged the Govern­

12

ment, and such other information as may be necessary for

13

us

14

the adequacy of the protection afforded the Government's

15

interests.

16

to review the reasonableness of the contract prices, and

The Comptroller General explained that GAO was re­

17

viewing the increasing federal procurement of drug products

18

and that the requested records were necessary to that review.

19

Respondent agreed that it was obligated to make available

20

certain of its cost records but it refused to produce the

21

remainder of the requested materials.

Thereafter, in March,

1975, it commenced the present action against the Comptroller
General for declaratory and injunctive relief.
The United States intervened as a defendant and
filed a counterclaim for access to the records sought by the
4

1

Comptroller General.

2

granted respondent's motion for summary judgment and denied

3

the Government's cross-motion.

4

respondent had reasonably construed the access provisions by

5

offering to furnish records of its direct manufacturing costs,

6

manufacturing overhead, royalty expenses, and delivery costs;

7

all of which respondent had allocated to individual products

8

and had expressly considered in setting its prices.

9

Following discovery, the District Court

The court concluded that

The court also agreed with respondent that the

10

access provision did not extend to records

1 1

respondent's costs of research and development, advertising

12

and promotion, distribution, and administration.

13

the court subsequently granted respondent's request for a

14

protective order as agreed upon by the parties.

15

concerning

In addition

On the Government's appeal the Court of Appeals af­

16

firmed in a per curiam opinion for the reasons stated by the

17

District Court.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, to what extent, if any, do you

19

disagree with Judge Lasker's conclusion that we have to deal

20

with this case in a contractual context rather than a statu­

21

tory context?

22

MR. LEVY:

We think Judge Lasker fundamentally mis­

23

conceived the question before the Court.

24

clusively a question of statutory construction.

25

We think it is ex­

First, it's clear, I believe, that the contractual
5

1

provision that was included in the contracts was meant to be

2

coterminous and synonymous with the requirements of the

3

statute; the language is virtually identical and no one could

4

have intended anything else.

5

intent of the parties might have been at the time in a con­

6

temporaneous understanding, apart from that question, we

7

think it's a matter of law with the construction of the statute

8

tohidh governsthis case

9

of the parties, and we think that is a statement of general

10

applicability,' as we cite to Professor Corbin and others in

11

our reply brief.

12

13
14

But, apart from whatever the

rather than the subjective intentions

So the sole question before the Court, in our view,
is the construction of the access-to-records statutes.
The Court of Appeals in affirming Judge Lasker's

15

opinion specifically declined to follow the intervening deci­

16

sions of the 7th Circuit in the Eli Lilly and Abbott Labs

17

cases which had rejected the holding of the District Court

18

in the present case and had sustained access requests by GAO

19

that were identical to the request it made of respondent.

20

Accordingly, the single issue presented in this case

21

is the Comptroller General's right of access to records with­

22

held by respondent pertaining to its costs of research and

23

development, advertising and promotion, administration, and

24

distribution.

25

Respondent does not dispute that these costs are an
6

1

integral and significant part of its pharmaceutical business.

2

Indeed, it has been generally estimated that indirect costs

3

like these constitute as much as 91 percent of the price of a

4

drug product, and the pharmaceutical companies spend approxi­

5

mately 12 percent of sales revenues on research and develop­

6

ment alone.

7

under the contracts in question here were used as part of

8

respondent's general revenues to defray these costs of doing

9

business.

It is also clear that payments by the Government

Nevertheless, respondent contends the records of

10
11

these costs are categorically outside the scope of the access

12

provisions.

13

respondent seems to advance two different interpretations.

14

First, that access is authorized only for records of costs

15

that are computed or allocated on a product basis and are

16

expressly taken into account in setting the prices for

17

the items sold to the Government.

18

of access is limited to records of manufacturing and other

19

costs specifically incurred in performing the particular

20

contracts.

21

Although his position is not entirely clear,

QUESTION:

Or, second, that the right

May I interrupt just to get something

22

on the table?

Would you in the course of your argument tell

23

us why it's important for the Government to know how the

24

money spent on research and development was spent?

25

why do you want that information?
7

I mean,

MR. LEVY:

1

We need that information in order to

2

determine the full costs of the products that the Government

3

bought.
QUESTION:

4
5

spent as much as they say they spent on research?
MR. LEVY:

6
7

10

QUESTION:

Don't they even given you the percentage

of their total expenditures that go into research and develop­
ment?
MR. LEVY:

11
12

We don't know how much they spent on it.

If they were able to tell us, for example --

8
9

Would you challenge the fact that they

I'm not aware that we have even that

information, and if that information were available -QUESTION:

13

If

they give you a balance sheet figure

14

that this year we spent $97 million on research and develop­

15

ment ,

16
17
18
19

20
21

22

would that satisfy you?
MR. LEVY:

Subject to the need to verify the accu­

racy of that figure and any internal allocation -QUESTION:

Well, say they gave you their tax

returns that showed it was accurate?
MR. LEVY:

Assuming that that's, the same relevant

definition of research and development -QUESTION:

What I'm asking you is do you really want

23

to look at how much they spent on different kinds of experi­

24

ments and --

25

MR. LEVY:

No, we don't -8

QUESTION:

1

2

Do you really know what you're looking

for here is why I’m asking these questions?
MR. LEVY:

3

What we're looking for is defined by the

4

purpose of the statutes, I believe.

In order to determine

5

the reasonableness of the price charged the Government, it

6

is necessary at least in this kind of a case where respondent

7

doesn't fully allocate its costs, in order for the Comptroller

8

General to construct a measure of the aggregate cost for the

9

items that are sold the Government.

10

This essentially consists of an effort to determine

11

the portion of the total costs of respondent's pharmaceutical

12

business that's assignable to the items purchased by the

13

Government.
QUESTION:

14

Well, they tell you what's assignable

15

to it.

16

costs, as I understand it.

17

you is the unallocated costs.

18

MR. LEVY:

19

20

They tell you all their direct costs and manufacturing
The only thing they don't tell

They don't.

Those unallocated costs

consist of -QUESTION:

I don't know why you -- I still don't

21

understand why it's important to you to go behind some kind

22

of a lump sum figure on all of those.

23

MR. LEVY:

Because we don't have a lump sum figure

24

on the totality of their costs.

25

certain select portions of their costs.
9

We only have a figure on

QUESTION:

1

If they charged you $10 for a product

2

and they say, we can show that $2.90 is attributable to direct

3

cost.

The other $7.10 is either unallocated costs or profit.
MR. LEVY:

4

And the Comptroller General needs to

5

determine the reasonableness of that price in relation to the

6

full cost.
QUESTION:

7

Would it matter if, of the $7.10 in my

8

hypothetical, if $1 was profit and $7 research or -- I don't

9

understand what difference it makes.

It seems to me you might

10

well say, if your direct costs are less than 20 percent or

11

something, the price is out of line.

12

you care about how they, what they do about the other 80

13

percent.
MR. LEVY:

14

But I don't know why

We care because we need to determine

15

what the full cost is of the products we buy.

16

some way of determining from the direct costs, if it were

17

invariably true that direct costs were always exactly 10

18

percent, then we might be able to make that extrapolation.
QUESTION:

19

20

If there were

You always will know what the percentage

of price that the direct costs represent.
MR. LEVY:

21

I don't believe so.

We won't know what

22

portion of the remainder is attributable to other costs that

23

are fairly assignable to the cost of doing business.

24
25

QUESTION:

They say none of it's assignable to the

product.
10

1

MR. LEVY:

They say none of it is allocated, but

2

Bristol is conducting a pharmaceutical business here. Its

3

profits from the sales to the Government and to other pur­

4

chasers have to fund the ongoing expenses of general overhead,

5

advertising and promotion, and so on.

6
7

QUESTION:

Comptroller General is trying to find out about?

8
9

MR. LEVY:

12

That's exactly what the purpose of the

inquiry is.

10
11

Well, isn't the allocation what the

QUESTION:

You can't answer it without seeing it,

MR. LEVY:

That's right.

can you?
If it turns out that a

13

fair allocation under generally accepted accounting principles

14

shows that these other costs of doing business constituted

15

a very small addition to the direct manufacturing costs, the

16

(difference between the cost and the price would be exorbitant,

17

the margin would be unreasonable, and GAO could well bring

18

this to the attention of Congress or to the procuring agencies

19

in order to change the way in which the Government procures

20

its pharmaceutical products.

21

On the other hdnd, if these other costs of doing

22

business turn out to constitute most of the price leaving a

23

reasonable difference between the cost and the price, then

24

the present system is adequate to protect the Government's

25

interest and no change may be in order.
11

But it's exactly to

1

determine the answer to that question that it's necessary to

2

inquire into the costs at least here where there is such a

3

large proportion of unallocated cost, the cost, that is, that

4

Bristol itself does not allocate.
That does not mean that the costs are not attribut­

5

6

able to this product and all other products and it's the divi­

7

sion, the allocation of those general costs that’s the

8

burden of the accountants who've gone in and looked at the

9

records.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Levy, were these drugs standard

11

drugs that were available for purchase by the public gener­

12

ally?

13

MR. LEVY:

As I understand it, they were what'are

14

called ethical pharmaceuticals- which require a prescription.

15

Yes, with a doctor's prescription, they were standard items.

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And did the Government pay the same

price that the public paid?
MR. LEVY:

I believe it paid the standard wholesale

price that Bristol offers.
QUESTION:

Was there any suggestion that there was

any conspiracy to maintain prices at an improper level?
MR. LEVY:

We did not allege that and we don't

think that access depends on any antitrust theory.
QUESTION:

The statute, I take it, gives you the

right to inquire in order to satisfy yourselves without just
12

1

2

taking anybody’s word on that?
MR. LEVY:

I think that's one purpose and it may

3

serve -- the fact that this is a standard item sold to the

4

public in substantial quantities gives some assurance, no

5

question, that the price was reasonable.

6

records statute gives us a way of checking that assurance.

7

QUESTION:

But this access to

This is quite different, isn't it, from

8

negotiating a contract to build a submarine or aircraft car­

9

rier or to buy an airplane or a tank?

10
1 1

12

MR. LEVY:

I presume it is different from those;

that is correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, at least don't you have some

13

assurance when you just acknowledged that the price to the

14

Government is comparable to what is charged other purchasers

15

on a wholesale basis?

16

MR. LEVY:

I think that is some assuronce, but

17

Congress determined that the market mechanism is not suffi­

18

cient assurance to make sure that the public funds were not

19

being unnecessarily expensed and that the prices charged the

20

Government were not excessive.

21

sons wholly apart from any antitrust violation why the prices

22

charged the Government might be unreasonable even though they

23

were based on standard catalog price.

24
25

QUESTION:

There may be a number of rea­

Well, isn't it possible too that Govern­

ment could get a lower wholesale price?
13

1

MR. LEVY: That might be possible.

2

QUESTION:

3

If they had full knowledge, as the

statute seems to authorize them to do.
MR. LEVY:

4

Exactly, because of the Government's

5

unique position it might be able to better procurement tech­

6

niques to obtain a price more favorable than that customarily

7

charged the general public.
QUESTION: May I ask one other question? Question abc ut

9

the rate. Judge Lasker analyzed your theory and he concluded

10

that under their allocation

--

there

are

no

excludable

1 1

records under your theory.

12

you disagree with his appraisal of the request in this case?

You have to see everything.

Do

13

MR. LEVY:

We do disagree with that.

QUESTION:

What is it that they would not have to

It's hard for me to identify

the record-keeping system of Bristol.

19

is conducted --

20

22

QUESTION:

The actual audit that

Well, you've had some opportunity.

They

did tender some records, didn't they?
MR. LEVY:

They did but no

inspection

has

yet

23

occurred, pending the outcome of this litigation.

24

audit to be conducted will depend very heavily on the nature

25

of respondent's record-keeping system.
14

The actual

It may be the case,

1

for example, that the records

will show that certain costs

2

are exclusively borne by or can be completely allocated to

3

a non-government purchaser, in which event they would not

4

be assignable to the government contracts and would not need

5

to be examined here except, as I say, for purposes of veri­

6

fication .
For example, in the advertising category, if

7

8

Bristol has a contract with an advertising firm on a retainer

9

basis or in some other way, and therefore, as it happens,

10

advertises nothing but a certain product and that product is

1 1

not one that the Government purchased under these contracts,

12
13

then when the auditors look at that charge from the advertisir S
i
company, that expense, and they convince themselves that there

14

is no'relationship whatever to the products that the Governmer t

15

purchased, then that cost would not need to be examined any

16

further.
QUESTION:

17

In other words your purpose is to see

18

if you cannot allocate costs to non-government business.

19

You'd have to do a rather thorough audit.
MR. LEVY:

20

The thoroughness of the audit will

21

depend in large part on the record-keeping that the respondent

22

maintains.

23
24

25

We haven't seen that yet, and so it's hard to know.
QUESTION:

You haven't looked at what they've

given you yet, either.
MR. LEVY:

Excuse me, Your Honor?

QUESTION:

You have not looked at what they've giver

MR. LEVY:

We have not, as I say, pending the out­

4

come of this litigation.

So it's hard to answer categori­

5

cally, but it does seem to us that it cannot be said that

6

consistent with the statute these entire categories of 'records

7

should be outside the scope of the review, which is the posi­

8

tion that the respondent takes here.

1 1

vant to the inquiry or not.

13

just as in civil discovery or subpoena demands, for example.

14

16

That will be subject to the

The question here is whether these types of cost
records are to be entirely outside the bounds of GAO -QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Levy, you do have the prob­

17

lem, I gather, that when Congress amended this statute to

18

add "directly pertains to" it had some purpose in mind in the

19

way of limitation, didn't it?

20

MR. LEVY:

21

22
23

I'll confess it's hard to know what

Congress had in mind, but, no, we -QUESTION:

No, no, but doesn't this language on its

face suggest Congress was imposing a limitation?

24

MR. LEVY:

I don't believe so.

25

QUESTION:

Oh.
16

MR. LEVY:

1

2

Because, first, I don't think that the

language "directly pertinent,"

on the face of the statute --

3

QUESTION:

Well, if that was added to the statute?

4

MR. LEVY:

' -- the modifier

5

"directly"

was

added

as a floor amendment -QUESTION:

6

And isn't there some legislative history

7

that suggests it was added because Congress wanted to limit

8

it?
MR. LEVY:

9
10

The amendment was proposed by Representative Hoffman.

1 1

12
13
14

15
16
17

The legislative history is very sparse.

QUESTION:

Why do you think Congress added that

MR. LEVY:

I think the word serves only as one of

word?

emphasis to underscore to GAO -QUESTION:

Congress went to all this trouble just

to add that word?
MR. LEVY:

Well, it wasn't all that much trouble.

18

The legislative history is as follows.

19

the Hardy bill, which is the principal basis for the sta­

20

tutes, included the requirement that the records be pertinent.

21

On the floor of the House the word "directly" was added as a

22

floor amendment by Representative Hoffman.

23

discussion or debate upon that provision.

24

ment to which Representative Hardy did not disagree; he was

25

fully willing to accept it.

The Hardy amendment,

There was no
It was an amend­

And it followed closely the
17

1

rejection of another amendment offered by Representative

2

Harvey that sought to accomplish a significant narrowing of

3

the statute in much the same way the respondent urges here.

4

That amendment was opposed by Representative Hardy and it

5

was defeated by a voice vote in the House.

6

those circumstances, the addition, the inclusion of the

7

modifier directly in front of "pertinent" does not indicate

8

that Congress had in mind any significant different purpose

9

or any difference in character than the bill that was

10

originally introduced by Representative Hardy.

1 1

12
13

So we think, in

QUESTION:

And what do you say Congress' purpose

We think its purpose there was simply to

14

emphasize to GAO that it should have a legitimate need before

15

undertaking examination of a contractor's records and should

16

not, in the language of the Representative introducing the

17

amendment, should not go "snooping" without reason.

18

that purpose in all probability would have been adequately

19

served by the word "pertinent."

20

that message was clear to GAO

21

objections by the business community, added the modifier to

22

emphasize the point.

23

of the statute in a significant way, as I say.

24

Hardy was fully amenable to it.

give you this information?
MR. LEVY:

Well, what has happened here is we've

brought lawsuits, or where a drug company is involved --

4

QUESTION

I thought they brought the lawsuit.

5

MR. LEVY

Well, in one or two cases we commenced

6

litigation and in the others the drug companies did.

7

QUESTION

To do what?

8

MR. LEVY.

Usually to seek declaratory and injunc-

ing statute or to prevent GAO's inspection.
QUESTION- Now,

we're not going to give you the information, what can you

QUESTION:

Don't you have another remedy?

If they

didn't give you enough information, you could say, well,

23

we're just not going to give you any more contracts because

these, on the face of them, look outrageous.

MR. LEVY:

I don't think at all that this is black­

1 1

in a contract and a contractor refuses to accede to that, to

adhere to that congressional requirement, I think it would

be incumbent upon GAO, the procuring agency, not to enter

14

into any further contracts with that contractor.

MR. LEVY:

There is no constitutional question, as

QUESTION:

It's nothing but the statute?

That's correct.

Yes.

How are you going to allocate it between the United States

MR. LEVY:

What they say is

that they didn't

recognized though that the Government's payments as part of

MR. LEVY:

We wish them well in that endeavor, then,

hut when it's the Government's interest that is being pro­

that their decision on what they do with cost-based contracts

the facts here, you just can’t tell whether or not their

I think the ambiguity is where you say,

its sales to the Government.

14

the Government's payments were used to bear these expenses,

mandate from the Congress, to inquire into that.
MR. WEIL:

Yes, and Your Honor's question is di­

23

rected again to pertinency, pertinency for the prices that

24

were charged the Government and what went into determining

25

those prices.

Now, if research and development costs had

3

I suppose you and I would agree on the

4

basis of experience that sometimes research and development

5

simply cannot be allocated with precision.

6

MR. WEIL:

Most times.

7

QUESTION:

That you just don't know.

The account­

8

ants do the best they can, usually having in mind what's the

9

best for the client, isn't that correct?;
MR. WEIL:

10

Yes.

That is absolutely correct, and

1 1

it's quite pertinent here, Your Honor.

You're absolutely

12

correct as to the difficulty of allocating RSD expenses.

13

For example, in 'the field that Bristol is in, much RSD turns

14

out to be fruitless.

It doesn't even result in a product.

15

QUESTION:

Isn't that true of almost all RSD?

16

MR. WEIL:

I suspect that it is.

Therefore, how

17

can one allocate to products that are being successfully mar­

18

keted a cost for research and development -QUESTION:

19

Well, even conceding its difficulty,

20

would you agree that there could be a deliberate misalloca-

QUESTION:

Everything else is

Well, Mr. Weil, suppose you've got, you

14

do have RSD expense and let's suppose that to develop certain

15

products, A, B, C., which you are selling to the Government,

16

you did have research and development costs.

17

assume that.

18

assume that but you just haven't allocated your research and

19

development costs to these, there are no records of alloca­

20

tion but nevertheless you just know that there were research

21

and development costs involved in coming up with these succes-

22

ful products that you're now selling the Government --

Let's just

I'm not saying that's the case here, but if you

23

MR. WEIL:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

Now, how about those research and

25

development costs?

If you did approach the job of
38

1

allocation, ordinary accounting practice would say, why, of

2

course, part of this should be allocated to these products

3

A, B, and C.
MR. WEIL:

4

May I -- and I did point this out in

5

our brief,: but I think it would bear reiteration here: try to

6

be prophylactic against an ambiguity in the term "allocate."

7

There are two stages at which allocation of RSD expenses might

8

be made.

-- but has not -- say, we also have to recapture in this con­

12

13
14

If they did that, then Bristol would give the C.G.
access to those records, but Bristol did not.

Now --

15

QUESTION:

Then you don't allocate them?

16

MR. WEIL:

We don't allocate them to the price, and

17

it's price that counts here.

Mr. Levy has referred frequently

Judge Lasker said that

1 1

are recoverable solely from nongovernmental business.

I think he was incorrect even in that. Because, suppose that

MR. WEIL:

They've got to make it up somewhere.

And that's why.there's no limit to the records as has been

19

indicated by Mr. Justice Powell, I believe, and by Mr. Justice

20

Stevens.

There's no limit.

As you develop this, would you tell us

in a little more detail what records you are willing to tender

Yes, we have that in our brief.

Do they know, for example, what your

aggregate research and development costs are?
HR. WEIL:

4

Well, they can -- no, they don't, Your

5

Honor, but by simple arithmetic subtraction of the price they

6

pay, from the price that the Government pays, of the costs

7

that we do give them, they know that the residue has to be

QUESTION:

And maybe just a hair of profit?

12

MR. WEIL:

Well, we hope so.

I've got to get paid.

13

What Bristol has said it would give are its manufacturing

14

cost -- this appears at page 6 of our brief -- manufacturing

15

costs such as raw and packaging materials, labor and fringe

16

benefits, quality control and supervision, then manufacturing

17

overhead such as plant administration, production, planning,

18

warehousing, utilities, and securities, royalty expense, and

19

in a general way the cost of delivery to the sites specified

in the contract.

exactly how they do allocate, what they don't allocate, how

11

they arrive at the prices they charge the Government.

12

that information, they then come back with the facts that are

13

now on the record, and based on those facts I think our argu­

14

ment is a perfectly sound one, that the judiciary is in a

15

position to say that within the meaning of "directly perti­

16

nent" as it appears in the contracts -- and I do want to get

17

back to the contract thing again -- but as it appears in the

18

contracts, and in the statute itself, does not embrace costs

19

of Bristol that in no way affected or went into or were fac­

20

tored into determining the prices charged the Government.

21

They were not directly pertinent to that.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Weil, from what you've said so

23

far I take it you think that some cost figures are required by

that the

be competing in the sense that if the identical formula is

the same pharmacological results.

MR. WEIL:

There's considerable elasticity.

These are wholesale prices that are

Are they available to any purchaser by wholesale?
MR. WEIL:

-- they run on usually about five percent below the prices

MR. WEIL:

Well,

on that point, and on Mr. Justice

21

Blackmun's question about whether there isn't some assurance

In one exchange, and this appears in two exchanges, and the

first one, you can find at page four of our brief, where one

6

of the Congressmen, Mr. Eberharter, said to Mr, Hardy,

7

"Now, I would like to ask one question.

8

-- namely, the Hardy Amendment -- "Does this refer to con­

9

tracts that have been made in the past?"

10

Mr. Hardy:

Congress realized the difference.

Does this refer"

"It could not refer to contracts that

1 1

have been made in the past because it requires the insertion

12

of a clause in contracts."

13
14

15

Mr. Eberharter;

"I see.

I notice that you give

power to the Comptroller General."
Mr. Hardy:

"It does not give him power to inspect

16

the books and records but requires that a clause be inserted

17

in the contracts permitting him to inspect."

18

A clear differentiation in the sponsor's mind be­

19

tween a statutory power and whatever permission he might ob­

20

tain via a contract, namely, via the application of law of

21

contracts, contract principles.

22

Then, a little bit later, Congressman -- at page
