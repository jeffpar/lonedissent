MR. CHIEF JUSTICE .BURGER:

Mr. Pierce, I think you may proceed whenever you're

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD D. PIERCE, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

We'll hear arguments next

MR. PIERCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The City of Memphis petitioned for’ certiorari in

1 1

this Court solely because of what we perceive to be a clear

12

and inherent danger in the majority opinion of the 6th Circuit

13

to the ability of this nation's ci.ties to effectively balance

14

all the conflicting interests which come before them and ef­

15

fectively govern.

16

In short, we saw the danger which we believe Judge

17

Celebrezze saw, in the dissenting opinion, Judge Celebrezze

18

having been mayor of one of the great cities of this country,

19

and also, some of the concerns that were expressed by this

20

Court in Washington v. Davis.

21

In every democracy, the legislative and administra­

22

tive parts of that democracy have the burden to weigh con­

23

flicting and competing interests.

24

25

Inevitably, in any such

decision, there will be winners and losers.

And depending

upon whose ox is gored, the party that is not successful will

feel either irritated or disappointed or in some respects

itself.

Well, it -- across it; yes, sir.

As I've stated, it is a small in--town neighborhood,

an inner city neighborhood.

The streets are small and winding,

The houses vary from rather sma.ll homes to rather large homes.
One thing I think is particularly significant in view of the
arguments that have been made by the plaintiffs in this case,
is that there: are., in addition to West Drive, there are seven
other entrances into this subdivision.

Hein Park, as we look to the map in the amicus brief,
is bounded by Jackson Avenue on the north, Trezevant Street
on the east, North Parkway on the south, and, actually,
Chdirles Place, which runs into West Drive, on the west.

To

the west of that is Southwestern University.

seven other entrances into Hein Park, including two from the

17

north, so that, one of the complaints made by the plaintiffs

18

in this case was that they wanted to come down Springdale

19

Street, and that they were being effectively shut out of Hein

20
21

22
23
24

Park and would not be permitted to come into Hein Park for
racial or other reasons.
Actually, all they would have to do would be to make
a. turn either to the east or to the west, of a.bout 10 0 feet.
If they turn to the east 100 feet, they can proceed into
Cypress Drive, which runs into Center Drive, which runs right

25

into Noi’th Parkway.

2

100 feet, they can go into Charles Place, which runs into West

Drive, and they will be back out again at the Parkway.

other entrances into Hein Park are at North Drive and at East

1 1

is certainly an inner city neighborhood, and one deemed worthy

12

of support, as are all.

14

the quality of life within that neighborhood.

most likely to proceed to the south and to go onto North

that it is certainly not a racial impact, really one of geo­

Now, the Court is, I'm certain, familiar with the

2

fact that the original petition, complaint, filed in this cause:

3

was dismissed and this case went to the 6th Circuit.

4

court remanded that back to the district court, setting out

5

some rather basic ground rules, primarily a ground rule the.t

The respondents have argued that the trial judge -and so did the majority in the 6th Circuit -- argued that the
trial judge had felt himself too constrained by the mandate of
the 6th Circuit in Greene I.

And it was because of that con­

straint that he found no intent.
It's simply not true.

3

mined that certainly no starkness existed on which to place

a badge of slavery.

5

All issues

And at the conclusion, the trial court deter­

Pie determined that on the record before him, the

6

proof adduced in that case did not rise to the level of proving

7

that there was any discriminatory intent on the part, of the

8

City of Memphis, in pla.cing this barrier at West Drive.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Pierce, does the record tell us why

10

this happened at the particular time in history it did?

1 1

other words, were there changes in traffic patterns or changes

12

in the composition of the residential neighborhood, either in

13

Hein Park or out, or why did this happen when it did?
MR. PIERCE:

14

In

Your Honor, the record reflects that

15

approximately three years before -- I think, back in 1970,

16

the neighbors became concerned about the traffic pattern, and

17

if I may digress one minute to say something about the Hein

18

Park neighborhood, as I indicated to you, this neighborhood

19

is about 60 years old, and for a long period of time it was

20
21

22
23
24

25

made up of a lot of original residents, senior citizen, elderly
people.

Since that time, and in the past decade or so, younger

people and young middle-aged people have moved into this
neighborhood, have reclaimed these old houses, and have started
to repair them and fix them up and turn them into a better
neighborhood.

14

a suggestion was made to them at that time that the real cul­

15

prit in this area was the traffic that was coming through

16

West Drive, that if they could somehow shut off that major --

17

what had become a country lane into a major thoroughfare

as being unreasonable, but

City saying, that's something you might point toward.

Celebrezze, and possibly by the majority of the 6th Circuit.

18

We have some problems understanding exactly what they've said.

19

But Judge Celebrezze. is certainly of the opinion that the 6th

20

21
22
23
24

25

It was found by Judge

Circuit decided this case on the basis of 1982.
We believe that 1982 does and should require a find­
ing of racial motivation and intent.

The decisions of this

Court would indicate that is a path which this Court would
have us follow.

Going back to the dicta in Jones v. Alfred

H. Mayer, talking about all racially motivated conduct,
16

1

and fol]owing the line of cases of this Court, in Washington

2

v. Davis, in Arlington Heights, and in Personnel Administrator

3

v. Feeney, the path which this Court has indicated to us is

4

that racially motivated, racial intent should be a requirement

5

under 1982.
QUESTION:

6

Of course, before you can get to that

7

there's the preliminary question about whether or1 not Section

1982 even in the presence of racial intent can apply in cir­

23

When we're trying to find out what the decisionmakers meant,

CHAMBLISS:

Well, I think it's two things.

8

I have to answer that way.

:

One, that intent was unneces­

9

sary, but intent, it was found in this particular ca.se.

10

I think that, and I sta.rted off by saying, I think this is a

1 1

very bad case to deal with the question of intent because the

12

record clearly shows-all kinds of irregularities, violations,

13

and departure from normal procedure, and I think on the evi­

14

dence. credited to the district court, that we prevail on the

issue of intent.

They found that the procedures were proper and it was not

There are sidewalks, and there is proof in the record that

7

there are areas all over Memphis, in black neighborhoods and

8

white neighborhoods, mixed neighborhoods, where there are no

9

sidewalks, where there are no curbs and gutters.

There are

10

reasons for that.

11

It was brought up originally in the original complaint that

12

was filed by Mr. Greene in his official,
