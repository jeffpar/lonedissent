ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARLON L. DALTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
MR. DALTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes to the Court on a writ of certiorari
to the United States Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.

Two

petitions were filed, one by the United Mine Workers and a
second on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board.
I should add that the Department of Labor, which administers
ERISA, is not a party in this proceeding but concurs in the

15

views presented by the Labor Board.
16

The question presented in both cases is whether a
17

management-appointed trustee of a jointly administered Taft18

Hartley trust fund is a collective bargaining agent within the
19

meaning of Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations
20

Act, which forbids unions from coercing employers in the selec­
21

tion of their collective bargaining representatives.
22

In practical terms, at issue in this case is whether
23

a union may strike as part of its effort to induce an employer
24

to contribute to a multieitiployer, as distinct from a single ,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

3

1

employer, pension, or welfare fund.

2

Now, although the dealings between Amax Coal Company

3

and the union in this case were rather complex, the facts that

4

relate to the sole issue that's before this Court are rather

5

straightforward.

6

11

Amax Coal Company mines coal.

It does so

primarily in the midwest and in deep shaft bituminous mines.
It bargains with the UMW through the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association with respect to its midwest operations.
Now, in 1972, Amax Coal Company opened its first
surface strip mine in Gillette, Wyoming, called the Belle Ayr
mine, and that's the subject of this litigation.

Amax did not

negotiate through the BCOA in connection with the Belle Ayr mine
12

but instead entered into a separate agreement with the mine
13

workers that was patterned on the BCOA contract.

And pursuant

14

to that independently negotiated contract Amax contributed to
15

the union's national multiemployer pension and welfare funds.
16

In January of 1975, at the expiration of that Belle
17

Ayr contract and the expiration of several other western surface
18

mine contracts, the union struck the Belle Ayr mine and the
19

mines of other western coal operators.

The following month, in

20

February, the union and Amax began negotiations over the Belle
21

Ayr mine but they reached an impasse in March and in mid-March
22

-- I think, March 17 -- Amax resumed operations at the mine
23

under its last contract proposal.
24

Over the course of the next

year the parties engaged in sporadic negotiations but no

25
North American Reportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

4

1

agreement was ever reached between them.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Dalton, does the Government concede

3

that if the person in question here was a collective bargaining

4

agent rather than a trustee, there was coercion on the part of

5

the union?
MR. DALTON:

6

Yes.

Now, among the sticking points

7

which led to the impasse was -- and there were several, but

8

there's only one that's before this Court today -- was Amax's

9

refusal to continue to contribute to the multiemployer pension

10

11

and trust funds.

Those funds were set up pursuant to Section

302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, the TaftHartley Act, and provide

for comprehensive health and retire­

12
13

ment benefits.

Those funds are administered pursuant to that

section by three trustees, one appointed by the union, one
14

appointed by management, and the third trustee to be appointed
15

by the other two.
16
At the time the negotiations between Amax and the
17

union began over the Belle Ayr mine, the trustees were already
18

appointed, the trust funds were set up, and the trustees were
19

engaged in the active administration of them.
20
Now, While acknowledging that the union's trust fund
21

proposals were mandatory subjects of collective bargaining,
22

Amax took

the position that the management-appointed trustees

23

were collective bargaining representatives and that therefore
24

the union's insistence to impasse, the union's striking in an
25

effort to induce the company to contribute to those trust funds

constituted a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(B).

And that's be­

They filed other charges but they are

Mr. Dalton, may I ask one thing?
Yes.
I gather the Belle Ayr mine was not part

of the collective bargaining unit in connection with which the
original trust fund was set up.
MR. DALTON:

Is that right?

That is correct.

Well, the Belle Ayr

12

mine was not; that's correct.
13

QUESTION:

The Belle Ayr mine was not?

14

MR. DALTON:

Right.

15

QUESTION:

And the demand of the union was that,

16

nevertheless, the contributions to the pension fund be made to
17

the trustees set up under a different unit than this.

Is that

18

it?
19

MR. DALTON:

The trustees of one of the national

QUESTION:

And there's no question of the legitimacy

of that demand and that lit

MR. DALTON:

Yes.

No one has -- in fact, that issue

10

11

trust.

The Board stated that trustees are "solely fidu­

A two-judge panel of the court of appeals reached the

opposite conclusion and pro tanto refused to enforce the Board's
order.

In a nutshell, we submit that Congress did not intend

for Taft-Hartley trustees to function as agents for either
unions or employees while engaged in the 1 administration of a

12

13

trust; that trustees cannot do so without violating duties im­
posed upon them both by the common law and by ERISA: and that

14
Taft-Hartley trustees do not in practice engage in collective
15
bargaining.
16
Now, these arguments are laid out in our briefs, and
17
I don't intend to elaborate on them here unless, of course,
18
the Court wishes otherwise.

Instead I propose to address my

19
remaining time to three considerations.

One, the meaning of

20

the term "representative" as used in Section 302(c)(5).

Second,

21

the

equal

Representation

provision

of that section, what it

22

means, what it's designed to accomplish, and how.

And third,

23
some of the legal and institutional consequences of the decision
24
below.

If all goes according to plan, my colleague of this

25

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

.7

1

side of the podium will address the impact of the decision belov\

2

on multiemployer funds, and particularly on the funds at issue

3

in this case.

4

I note at the outset that the term "representative"

5

is not a term of art.

6

National Labor Relations Act or the Labor Management Relations

7

Act and as this Court unanimously observed in United States v.

8

Ryan, one Justice not participating, the terms "representative"

9

and "collective bargaining representative" are not synonymous.

10
11
12

13
14
15

It has no fixed meaning within the

Amax argues that representative refers to persons who
advance the interests of the parties that appoint them.

That

construction however, as we demonstrate in our brief, is flatly
inconsistent with Section 302's requirement that contributions
be held in trust and that they be held in trust for the sole
and exclusive benefit of trust beneficiaries.
QUESTION:

Let's assume that, of course, a trustee

16
represents no one except the interests of the trust.

I take

17
it you agree that that's so?
18
MR. DALTON:

Absolutely; yes.

19
QUESTION:

But in a sense, does not -- is

not

each

20

of the trustees, one appointed by the union and one by the
21

employer, a representative in a limited sense?
22

MR. DALTON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's our

23
position that they represent those parties, that the limitations
24
of that representation are such that in any instance in which
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

8

1

the interests of the parties to the collective bargaining agree­

2

ment might possibly conflict with the interests of the benefi­

3

ciaries, then the former must recede, and therefore it's inap­

4

propriate to consider them as collective bargaining representa­

5

tives because the latter owe an undivided duty of loyalty to

6

7
8

9
10

11

the parties that they represent.
It's our position, it's the common law, that trustees
must eschew the interests of third parties, that they owe a
sole primary exclusive obligation to trust beneficiaries.
That's also -- ERISA has codified the common law and has essen­
tially made those principles matters of federal statute, and
therefore the most that can be said of the term representative

12

as used in this Section 302(c)(5) is that it means, in effect,
13
designee; refers to the fact that trustees are appointed by
14

unions and employers.
15
So the next question is, to what end?

What is the

16
purpose of the appointment of trustees by employers?

And In

17
particular, what is the purpose of the equal participation rule,
18
that for every trustee appointed by a union there must be a
19
trustee appointed by an employer?
20
Now, it is common ground that this equal participatior
21

rule was one of a set of strictures.

The requirement that

22
contributions be made into a formal trust is another, set up by
23
Taft-Hartley to deter unions and union officials from misusing
24
and misappropriating pension and welfare funds.
25

However, there's a serious division among the parties

2

with respect to how that's to be achieved.

3

that by their mere presence employer-appointed trustees serve

4

to check potential pension abuses.

11
12

position to discover and ferret out abuses and to

union-appointed trustees, the management trustees are in the posi­
tion to block any efforts by their colleagues to advance the
union's interest.
None of these steps requires the slightest deviation

13
14

Furthermore, by participat­

Thirdly, because they are equal in number to the

9
10

It's our position

from the exclusive obligation, exclusive duty of loyalty that
trustees, management-appointed and union-appointed alike, owe

15

to the beneficiaries of the trust.

In marked contrast, the

16

3rd Circuit conception of how this watchdog provision is to
17

operate is premised on the trustees' exhibiting at best divided
18

loyalties.

The court of appeals stated that the trustees of a

19

Taft-Hartley trust are "expected to advance the interests" of
20

the appointed parties.
21

The court took the position that this advancing of
22

private party interest or third-party interest was "essential to
23

the operation of Section 302(c)(5), and that the clash of party
24

interests creates "a distilling process which would provide
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

10

1

safeguards against trust fund corruption."

2

Now, whether or not this approach would root out

3

corruption, we submit that it would have the inevitable collat­

4

eral consequence of undermining orderly administration of

5

trust and of fostering pursuits and interests that are alien to,

6

or in any event, not congruent with the interest of trust bene­

7

ficiaries.

8

istration of the trust, as the court of appeals termed it, would

9

lead to frequent stalemates, broken either by resort to arbi­

10

11
12
13
14

This ongoing collective bargaining within the admin­

trators, compulsory arbitration, which I might notice are con­
trary to the way we normally think of collective bargaining, or
impasses broken by horse trading in which concessions on trust
issues might well be exchanged for concessions on non-trust
issues.
Now, that compromise or subordination of the interest

15

of trust beneficiaries is but one of the consequences of the
16

decision below.

In addition, the introduction of collective

17

bargaining considerations into the day-to-day administration of
18

trust would have the effect of injecting the National Labor
19

Relations Board into the routine matters of trust administra­
20

tion.

Whenever a disappointed party, be it a beneficiary of

21

the trust or a trustee, concluded that one of the trustees had
22

failed to engage in good faith collective bargaining, then that
23

person would be entitled to file with the National Labor Rela­
24

tions Board an unfair labor practices charge.

And so, contrary to the scheme that was set up by

courts, the National Labor Relations Board would

MR. DALTON:

QUESTION:

Mr. Dalton, may I ask you a question?
Yes.
I remember reading somewhere in the briefs

8

that the trustees of this fund had the power to set the royalty

9

rates on salvage coal -MR. DALTON:

10

QUESTION:

11
12

Which I gather is a method of determining

how much is contributed to the trust funds by the employers?
MR. DALTON:

13
14

Yes.

With respect solely to refuse or salvage

coal.
QUESTION:

To the extent that they have the power to

15

determine the level of contributions by the employers, are they
16

not determining a matter which would normally be subject to
17

collective bargaining?
18

MR. DALTON:

Yes, but they would do that by virtue of

19

the agreement of the parties during collective bargaining.

In

20

other words, that

provision which --

21

QUESTION:

Well, supposing the collective bargaining

22

agreement had an open-ended provision saying the trustees shall
23

determine from month to month how much the employer shall con­
24

tribute to the fund.

Would they then be representatives within

GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

the meaning of the Act?
MR. DALTON:

2

I would submit not.

That's obviously a

3

more difficult case than that presented here in which every one

4

of the rates of contribution in the collective bargaining

5

agreement would be set in 'the Contract, except for refuse or -QUESTION:

6

7
8

9

But why --

you say it's not significant that that's limited to salvage
coal?

You're saying, even if they had an open-ended power to

fix the contribution rate, they'd still not be representatives?
MR. DALTON:

10
11

Royalties on the salvage coal.

They still would not be collective bar­

gaining representatives, so they would indeed obviously be en­
gaged in the setting of those rates.

12

QUESTION:

Well, what if they were to determine the

13

hours of work on which royalties would be paid or the -14

MR. DALTON:

Well, then we begin --

15

QUESTION:

At what point do they become representa­

16

tives?
17

MR. DALTON:

That's -- at that point I begin to worry

18

because at that point, and maybe even at some point prior to
19

that, they're engaged in brokering the relationship between
20
employers and employees, which is one of the hallmarks of
21

collective -22

QUESTION:

It seems to me they're- doing- that as even

23

with the smaller item of royalty rates on salvage coal.
24

MR. DALTON:

Except that one of the other hallmarks

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

13

1

of collective bargaining representatives is that, is that what

2

they are negotiating around is the contract.

3

your hypothetical the trustees would be making those judgments

4

in connection with administering

5

least the trust funds.

6

QUESTION:

I take it that in

the trust instrument, or at

Well, if the trust instrument gave them the

7

power to adjust -- to make a term of the collective bargaining

8

agreement, which in effect it does when it says, how much money

9

shall be contributed to the fund?

0

11

12
3
4

That's normally in the agree­

ment rather than in the trust instrument.

They are getting --

it seems to me they're getting bargaining power.
MR. DALTON:

Well, a third distinction between bar­

gaining parties and trustees is that when the former reach im­
passe, they're entitled to -- at least, if we're talking about
issues that are mandatory bargaining issues, they're entitled to

5

resort to their economic weapons, strike, lockout, et cetera,
6

whereas under Section 302(c)(5), when trustees reach an impasse,
7

either that impasse is broken by neutral trustees, if such
8

exist, or the trustees are entitled to themselves appoint a
9

compulsory arbitrator or to ask the district court to do so.
20

And I take it, under your hypothetical, that if the trustees
2

were -- to accept the trustees are empowered to set royalty
22

rates for salvage coal, any disputes would be resolved by com­
23

pulsory arbitration, and that's a different mechanism, at least,
24

than this typical collective bargaining.
25

1

QUESTION:

But the employer here doesn't want his

2

royalty rate set by either the trustees selected by the employ­

3

ees or or by the compulsory arbitrator selected by them.

4

either event, is not that person doing something that the em­

5

ployer would like to have his own representative have a voice

6

in?

In

Isn't that the problem?
MR. DALTON:

7

Well, I just have a couple of responses.

8

At the point that the trustees would be reappointed, Amax at

9

least theoretically could have a

10

employer trustees.
QUESTION:

11
12
13

voice in selecting the

Well, Mr. Dalton, didn't Amax, as to its

membership on the multibargaining unit, did have a voice in
the selection of this trustee?
MR. DALTON:

14

In fact, Amax -- yes -- that's precisely

-- Amax -- Number one, Amax did select these trustees in connec­
15

tion with this deep shaft bituminous mine -16

QUESTION:

Then your argument is, not that this is

17

not a representative, but he's not being compelled to take a
18

representative he didn't have a voice in selecting.

That's a

19

different argument.

'

20

QUESTION:

I thought you had conceded that there was

21

coercion?
22

MR. DALTON:

I did concede that there was coercion,

23

but not for all time.

The point that I began to make in respons e

24

to Justice Stevens' question was that the 51 percent, employers
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

15

1

representing 51 percent of the contributions are entitled to se­

2

lect the employer-appointed trustees, so there might come a time

3

in which Amax could ally with other employers and select a

4

trustee.

5

Second -QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dalton, am I wrong?

I thought

6

that Amax did have a voice in the selection of this particular

7

trustee through:

8

9
10
11

BCOA, did it not?

MR. DALTON:

That is absolutely correct.

That is

absolutely correct.
QUESTION:

If that’s your argument --

QUESTION:

Well, of course, it would tuhn out to be

exactly the sdmd, whether or not that was correct, wouldn't it?
1
13

QUESTION:
MR. DALTON:

That's right.'
Yes, it would.

Moreover, we note that --

14

QUESTION:

The trustee is not a collective bargaining

15

representative.
16

MR. DALTON:

Yes.

Moreover, we note that Amax did not

17

have to agree to this particular provision or any other provi­
18

sion of the union's proposal in the course of this collective
19

bargaining, as we stress in our reply brief.

The duty to bar­

20

gain is not an obligation to agree.

I will reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

The Labor Board's opinion and the opinion of the

Secretary of Labor and the opinion of the Solicitor on behalf

of the National Labor Relations Board in my opinion is very

10
11
12
13
14

correct.

To my mind, if the trustee is a bargaining representa­

tive of the appointing employer or union, that would lead to
the administration of these funds by the National Labor Rela­
tions Board to unfair labor practices, which I think has been
in one court, at least, in the District of Columbia, that a
claimant for benefits under the fund took the position that the

15

union had not fairly represented him as a trustee'of the1 fund
16

and therefore that he was wrongfully denied a pension that he
17

should have been delivered.

That case is cited in our brief in

18

Miniard v. Lewis.
19

The court rejected that argument and he said, no. The
20

court said, no, that these trustees had the fiduciary obligation
21

to represent the beneficiaries and the participants. And that
22

was a’ sole obligation on their part.

And I might point out to

23

this Court that the argument between the beneficiary or the

claimant, was between the trustees and not between an employer,

QUESTION:

2

Do you disagree, Mr. Combs, with the propo­

3

sition that on occasion under certain contracts the management

5

in another over a question as to the administration of the

6

trust?
MR. COMBS:

7
8

9

Yes.

I’ll agree that that could occur,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but it would be in the context these
trustees would be bound by the trust agreement that's required
under 302(c), and they would have to adjust as a fiduciary,

10

they would have to adjust the disputes between them based upon
11

their obligation that's specified in the trust agreement.
12

QUESTION:

And if that would go to court or to arbi­

13

tration or -- ?
14

MR. COMBS:

Well, under the way that these trust

agreements, it does not go to arbitration, it's a final judgment
16

of the trustees on the eligibility that's specified in the
17

trust agreements of that kind.

MR. COMBS:

That would be answered by the third

And to set up a forum that would be total at the

these kind of arguments, and what we're saying, that these funds
are balanced, that they were paid under 302(c), and that these

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one question before you

sit down, if I may.

Does the record tell us whether there have

7

ever been any disagreements on the royalty rate on the salvage
8

coal which have had to be referred either to the arbitrator or
9

perhaps back to the parties for clarification?
20

MR. COMBS:

I might say this for the information,

2

Mr. Justice Stevens, of you and the Court:

I am a trustee.

To

22

my knowledge there's been no dispute.

There's a formula that

23

was adopted years ago with the trustees and they still follow
24

that.

It has to do with BTUs and stuff of that character, and

25
North American Reporting

22

it's related to whether, to how many BTUs in there.

4

the Court:
5

This case and the section of the statute, Section
6

8(b)(1)(B) has been before this court before.

This particular

7

case involves several key concepts in the whole system of our
8

free collective bargaining system.

But one of the first ones

9

is -- which is contained in Section 9(a) of the Act -- and it's
20

emphasized, of course, in the Pittsburgh Plate Glass decision,
2

that the purpose of the Act is to assure to employees the full­
22

est freedom of the exercise of their rights to collective bar­
23

gaining, unit by unit.
24

Belle Ayr mine is a separate unit, always has been a

25

23

separate unit, never been part of the Bituminous Coal Operators

Association.

3

Another key concept in our free collective bargaining

4

system is that the parties' representatives will be free, that

5

they'll be dependent, that one party cannot be compelled to have

6

accepted or forced on him a representative whose interests he

7

feels are adverse or for whom they cannot act in even a fair

way.

an effort to be forced into another bargaining unit for whatever,

of a better description, was entitled, the Peabody

6

That strike commenced at Belle Ayr.

The Board found -- this is

It's not an issue before you, but

it is a fact., Since the other parties have gone into some of

the preliminary facts, I suppose there's no harm in shedding

light on this part of it.
21

The major issue in that strike that commenced was the
22

strike by the union, the United Mine Workers, to compel Amax to

participate in the Peabody Group.

Now the reason that Amax did

24

not participate in the Peabody Group, multiemployer bargaining,
25
North American Reporting

was because the Peabody Group would not listen, was not willing

too.

I think that what the Government and what the union have

totally ignored here, and it's not brought on the record, is
that bargaining is a matter of compromise, that the process of
collective bargaining as we see it is not black and white.
When the parties -- negotiation is defined, collective bargain­
ing is defined in Section 8(d) of the Act; it involves a nego­
tiated agreement

or any question arising thereunder.

That's

15

where you get the grievance and arbitration, adjustment Of

For example --

QUESTION:

unfair labor practices charge against them?
20

MR. GRUENDER:

Well, the employer filed an unfair

21

labor practice charge and the National Labor Relations Board
22

issued a complaint.

Eventually that complaint was found to be

23

meritorious by the Board and the court of appeals

2

might want to compare, because it's keyed to the understanding

3

of what collective bargaining is, and you must make a determina­

4

tion on that issue, and if you are to determine if an 8(b)(1)(B)

5

representative and a trust representative or an employer's

6

representative on the trust, is engaged in collective bargain­

7

ing.

10
11
12
13
14

We must understand the process.
The process of collective bargaining can be roughly

8

9

Now, let me give you a hypothesis that you

divided into two basic categories.

One, where you're negotiat­

ing to obtain an agreement or to fashion an agreement. Once that
agreement is fashioned, collective bargaining does not end.
As a matter of fact, you then get into the grievance and arbi­
tration process which has been sometimes called the administra­
tion of the collective bargaining agreement.
The collective bargaining representatives continue

15

and in a multiemployer type of bargaining situation the employer,
16

quite often there'll be what we call joint grievance procedures.
17

That is to say, the employer representative, the union repre­
18

sentative, will sit on a grievance panel, and one of the
19

employers who is a member of that bargaining unit, multiemployer
20
bargaining unit, will come in, he's been violating the agree­
21

ment.

The management representative and the union representa­

22
tive may be sitting in judgment on a management representative,
23

and sometimes the management representative votes against the
24

other management representative.

And vice versa, for the union.

1

The process of collective bargaining, that's the adjustment of

2

grievances, has been undisputedly and uniformly, where a multi­

3

employer bargaining situation arises and the employer objects

4

to joint resolution of grievances by a multiemployer group and

5

says, look, they aren't collective bargaining representatives,

6

they're adjusting grievances concerning the interpretation, appli

cation, and meaning of this agreement.

The Board will

not force the employer to accept joint resolution of grievance
committees.

On the other hand, the process of administering

a trust, once it's negotiated --and that's done at the table,
negotiating the trust, in this case some of it's done by the
trustees, as Justice Stevens has pointed out, or pointed out oth er
sections of the trust, where they actually engage in negotia­

15

tions or creation of provisions of the so-called contract or
16

agreement.
17

But once that trust -- or, it's just like a collec­
18

tive bargaining agreement, and as a matter of fact, this trust
19

is incorporated word for word into the agreement.

are authorized, specifically, under the agreement, to interpret,

the union does what's right, we're going to subject them to the
conflict

that

‘occurs sometimes between labor and management.

That's the best way to insure to employees the best deal.
I'll get into that in just a minute because it's very crucial,
it seems to me, to understand the advantage to the employees.
In other words, I believe one of the myths here is that people

20

are thinking that the sole benefit of the employees will never
21

be taken care of by the employer or the union, and that for
22

some reason the employer is always trying to undermine the
23

union or the employees and vice versa.

That's not true.

24

The

key

factor with most employers is, once the

The same thing is
If an employer

ficiaries.

The interests of all, sometimes, are not necessarily

served by making a liberal interpretation of the fund so that it
16

pays out things without regard to what were the basic assump­
17

tions when it was started.
18

QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Dalton, earlier, in response to

19

questions, conceded that the conduct here constituted coercion.
20
Is what you're telling us that coercion may never appropriately
21
be applied to a trustee, that the very concept of a trust and a
22

trusteeship is incompatible with being subject to coercion from
23

anyone on any subject?
24

MR. GRUENDER:

No, sir.

I believe that just as in the

25
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

31

1

instance where -- and I think the law is, that just as in the

2

instance where a union cannot strike to compel an employer to

3

agree to joint grievance arbitration procedures or joint, in a

4

multiemployer bargaining context, that same reason exists to jus­

5

tify that he cannot be struck or coerced to select as a trustee

6

someone who he would not have an opportunity to

7

and trust in.
Now, once the distinction -- there's a distinction

8

9
10

11
12
13
14

have confidence

you've got to make, because they're polevaulting over, the
Government, the union -- once an employer agrees to engage in
multiemployer bargaining, he doesn't have a right to say, then,
if we'd have joined the BCOA -- I don't have a right to then say
the president' of BCOA will be myself, or my law associate here
or somebody else.

I don't have a right to select who that

representative is.

But once I commit to the joint bargaining,

15

once an employer commits to a multiemployer trust, and the cases
16

are legion on that, he doesn' t have1 a right to stand above all others
17

and select who the trustees are going to be.

But, just like in

18

the situations of the joint grievance procedure -- the Teamsters
19

are the

most

familiar kind of thing, tripartite kind of a

20

joint grievance procedure -- once an employer says, I'm not
21

going to agree to joint bargaining, then it completely defies
22

the whole federal policy and it subverts it, of unit by unit
23

bargaining, to say to him that he has to then put up with multi­

employer trusts.

Mr. Gruender, may I interrupt just a second ?

12

MR. GRUENDER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

It doesn't seem to me that the issue is

14

whether it's appropriate to bargain over whether you can join
15

a multiemployer trust.

You would object to the trust even If

16

you had, even if you could appoint the employer trustee, it
17

seems to me.
18

MR. GRUENDER:

You mean on the basis that it wasn't

19

as good?

That was the thing that moved them to that point, but

20

also the interests of BCOA trustees as opposed to the interests
21

of the employees at Belle Ayr were adverse.

There was no way

22

that the Belle Ayr, that the BCOA trustees could act in the best
23

interests of the Belle Ayr employees.

there are many multiemployer trusts in which one employer is

GRUENDER:

I know.

And If, in fact -- and they say that

-- 30 percent of our compensation package in this country today

is fringe benefits -- and if they say, and we all agree, that

fringes, fringe benefit funds are mandatory subjects of bargain­

it is very clear that the law does not permit the union to

QUESTION:

But nobody claims that you have to do it.

Nothing

question is

whether or not it encourages bargaining.

The

There are

other employers who are not as, perhaps as resolute as our
client, and were able to persevere in the pressure that they
were subjected to.

The question is if what the trustees do is

essentially the same thing in administering the terms, adjusting
the grievances under the trust agreement, or as Justice Stevens

has pointed out, in fact setting a contribution level, what

representatives

do,

why is it fair to

say that they cannot strike to force you to accept the BCOA

okay to be bound by another bargaining unit's representatives

who also do the same thing for something that accounts for only

Well, in ERISA it merely reemphasizes

what in fact the common law was with respect to 302(c) trusts
before and codifies them.

And it also recognizes the fact of

life that practically all of the trustees, most of them, in a
11

multiemployer situation

are in fact the collective bargaining

representatives, so that's fine, there's no problem with that.

And that there is nothing inconsistent with a person being a

The National Labor Relations Act de­

fines collective bargaining duties and the provision of the
National Labor Relations Act is 302(c)(5).

Now, Nedd v. Mine

what 302(c)(5) and the common law of trusts provided prior

to that -18

QUESTION:

Or equity.

19

MR. GRUENDER:

So, our point is that the conflict

20

that they say exists between employer and union representatives,
21

I think one of the points the briefs makes, I think, that the
22

employer might have to make a judgment about another employer
23

and there'd be a conflict of interest.

That happens all the

time in collective bargaining, that an employer passes judgment

There's nothing inconsistent with that at all.

No, I do not agree at all.

For

example -QUESTION:

11

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Don't you

think a collective bargaining representative of the union owes
12

his obligation to the union and not to the employer?
13

MR. GRUENDER:

At what point?

After an agreement is

14

reached or thereafter?

Once it's reached he holds an obligatior

15

to make sure the terms and provisions of that agreement are
16

carried out.
17

QUESTION:

I'm

talking about reaching the agreement.

18

In coming to the agreement all of his obligations and duties
19

are to the people he represents just as an advocate in this
20

Court owes the obligations to: to his client and to the Court.
21

Now, on the other hand, a trustee of the fund owes his obliga­
22

tion to the totality, does he not?

Not just to the person who

23

designated him but to the fund itself and the purposes of the
24

fund?

25
North American Reporting

MR. GRUENDER:

A BCOA collective bargaining represen­

association -- the union, to all the members of the union --

4

as he would if he were a trustee.

ity, is the'collective bargaining representative like a lawyer?

6

I don’t think so.

The law is much more complex on that.

QUESTION:

Now, as far as the exclusiv­

Well, 1 certainly,

the Chief Justice is

8

correct that in the collective bargaining process itself, before

9

the agreement is reached, or alternatively in the processing of

10

n
12

a grievance under the agreement, a collective bargaining repre­
sentative owes his exclusive and undivided loyalty to either the
union or the employer?
MR. GRUENDER:

13

QUESTION:

14

The person he represents.
Before an agreement is reached?

The association or person whose agent he

is .

MR. GRUENDER:

Subject to the law --

QUESTION:

MR. GRUENDER:

Subject to all the requirements of the

National Labor Relations Act, some of which impose obligations

on the employer's representative to watch out for the interests
20

of the employers.

That’s -- black and white.

QUESTION:

Can a collective bargaining representative as

defined in the National Labor Relations Act sit on a grievance

MR. GRUENDER:

I think it suggests certain things but

It's really not helpful to you.
That's not it; really.

I don't believe

I don't think it says what they think it

I don't think that something dropped out of a passage

in Congress is that significant, particularly in the context
of this particular legislation and the specific statutory lan­
guage that was used.

The section of the Act, 501(3) that says,

the term "representative" as used consistently throughout the
Act; the definition of "section" in Section 2; the clear delinea'
tion of the employer and employee representatives have a speci­
fic meaning, at least to employer and employee representatives;

16

and the use of the term "neutral."

Now, that means that some­

17

body has a flavor to them, or a bias, if you will.

Now, what I

18

mean to say, and one of the myths here, is that -- and I've
19

pointed it out, it's not in the

suit

--

they say that the

20

destruction of multiemployer trusts will come about as a result
21
of this.
22
All we can say is that that's just simply not true.
23

For example, if this particular union wished to maintain the
24

same program, it could have gone to the bargaining table and
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

43

1

insisted that the employer put up a duplicate fund, not with

2

the same, with the representatives, but with the employers'

3

representatives, and could have offered reciprocity to give

4

them the portability,

5

and could have struck for that

6

violation of the law, in our opinion.

it

could have offered the same benefits
and there would have been no

7

If, on the other hand, they insisted on forcing him

8

into another bargaining unit, a bargaining unit which in fact

9

has a long history -- I need not cite authority for it -- of dis­

10

11
12

13

ruptions , labor disputes,

which have caused problems with

those funds -- that not only does an injustice to the Belle Ayr
employees, who had

nothing to do with those disputes and dis­

ruptions and could do nothing to prevent them through the
grievance or arbitration procedure or any other way, it just

14
does violence to the whole procedure of bargaining unit by unit.
15
No destruction of collective bargaining is going to
16
come about as a result of this position.

As a matter of fact,

17
multiemployer trusts will stand or fall on their ability to
18
provide to the employees whom they cover, and to the employers
19
that they serve, what they hold themselves out to do, which is
20
better benefits at less cost, with the same amount of porta­
21

bility.

That, frankly, they have had a lot of favored treat­

22

ment in law.

Forty-year amortization schedules as opposed to

23
30, no -- very seldom are they covered with termination insur­
24
ance.

So they've had a little different set of rules to play

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. VFTCAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

44

1

with and, frankly, many of the employers have been able to

2

develop better programs for their employees at less cost.

3

Now, there is no reason in God's world that I can see or in the

4

National Labor Relations Act or reason or logic to require

5

employers to be subjected to demands that they have representa­

6

tives determining those fringe benefits, or be compelled to

7

accept the strike, or take a strike, on an issue like that

8
9

10
11

when those people stand almost on the same footing, in terms of
function, from the standpoint of the labor laws, as an
8(b)(1)(B) representative who is adjusting the grievances con­
cerning the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

12
13

Mr. Gruender,

you haven't really argued

this, but I've just been reflecting on your argument a little
bit.

Supposing you represented BCOA instead of just one

14

operator and the union said to BCOA, we want you to designate
15

John L. Lewis, Jr., as the employer trustee on the fund.

Under

16

your view, that's essentially -- and then they struck on that.
17

MR. GRUENDER:

They struck the BCOA?

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. GRUENDER:

And I represent the BCOA?

20

QUESTION:

You say that BCOA, just say, I want to pick

21

my own representative, and they say, no, no, we want John L.
22

Lewis, Jr., or somebody like that.
23

MR. GRUENDER:

The union did that?

24

QUESTION:

The union did it.

If the union did that,

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

45

1

under their view of the law, he would not be a representative

2

and that would be a perfectly proper strike, wouldn't it?

MR. GRUENDER:

That's

view

of

the

law.

I

4

think they're dead wrong.

kind of a demand.

6

trustees do, that there is nothing inconsistent between having

7

fiduciary obligations and being a collective bargaining repre­

I think the law doesn't support that

12

16
17

They have to.

Times are changing.

And the employer likewise.

There is nothing inconsistent with them

having both types of functions

and acting in the best interests

of the beneficiaries in the process, and the best interests of
the beneficiaries of the process might be fighting the union on
a particular claim which may not have merit, and that may be the
best interests of the beneficiaries because it would avoid a
wasting of the assets, a destruction of the actual assumptions,

18

for example, on which the trust was based, so that the rest of
19

the beneficiaries would have a benefit.
20

But the Board's error, in our opinion, is best evi­
21

denced, and the union's error is the same,

is they Confuse the

22

thing.

Look at Footnote 12 on page 20 of their brief, where

23

they state that -- they mix up the fact that fringes are a manda
24

tory subject and they said, well, since the trustee representative

is involved in that, that’s a mandatory subject too.

just like saying, wages, hours, and working conditions are a

the same.

Mr. Chief Justice, I just want to clarify my concession with

to a pension fund where the trustees have already been selected,

9

that that strike is in a sense coercion, but certainly I'm not c on-

12
13

That concession is limited to the

ceding that ^that's a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(B) or that in
this case the union was attempting to coerce Amax to participate
in multiemployer bargaining. That confusion of multiemployer
bargaining and participation in a multiemployer trust fund, I
think, is something that --

No, I think not.

QUESTION:

Why not?

22

MR. DALTON:

For two reasons.

First, in my mind, that

characterized as a union trustee and would thus violate the

Yes, that would

be a permissive subject and therefore the employer would not
be obligated.
QUESTION:

Would, it1 violate the provision that

12

prohibits the union from trying to designate the employer's
13

collective bargaining representative?
14

MR. DALTON:

I'm sorry?

15

QUESTION:

This case arises as a violation of whatever

16

statute it is that says the union cannot try to coerce the
17

employer into selecting a representative.
18

MR. DALTON:

Yes.

19

QUESTION:

Now, would he be a representative for

20

purposes of that section?
21

MR. DALTON:

No, he wouldn't but nevertheless the

22

union's demand would not be a mandatory subject for collective -23

be permissive.

Well, it wouldn't be mandatory, it would

It isn't even permissive if the man is a

representative.

2

MR. DALTON:

Well, my point clearly is the man is not

3

a representative for purposes of Section 8(b)(1)(B) so then

4

the question is, as it is here, assuming that the trustees are

5

not collective bargaining representatives, then the question is,

6

whether or not the union demand is a mandatory or permissive

7

subject of collective bargaining.

If mandatory, then the

employer

If not, then the employer

need not.

its

part.

The union could say, to avoid your sugges­

tion that he would become a union representative, say the union
just said, we will not, we Insist that you do not appoint
Mr. X, the man you had before.

He's been a pest in all our

negotiations; we don't want him on the trust fund.

They could

do that, though?
MR. DALTON:

My position is that the union could make

that request or demand, but the employer -QUESTION:

Without violating this statute?

MR. DALTON:

Without violating Section 8(b)(1)(B);

19

that the employer need not accept it and that the union would
20

not be entitled under the Act to bargain to impasse or strike
21

over that issue.

That's the distinction.

22

I have one other response, which is to your earlier
23

question about salvage rates, though I wonder why I want to
24

climb back in that pit.

But, to the extent that trustees are

25

authorized to determine royalty rates, they must do so in the

interest of the beneficiaries of the trust and not in order to

advance the interests of either the employer or the union.
