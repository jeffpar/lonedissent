Mr. Solicitor General, I think you may proceed when

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL WADE H. McCREE, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. McCREE:

9

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 provides

1 1

12

in part that unfair methods of competition in or affecting

13

commerce are declared unlawful.

14

whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any

15

corporation is using any unfair method of competition and if

16

it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding in respect

17

thereof

18

and serve on the respondent a complaint, which requires an

19

answer, administer the proceedings to establish the proof of

20
21

22
23
24

25

And it further provides that

to be in the interest of the public, it shall issue

the allegations set out therein, and then the issuance, in case
the allegations are established, of a cease and desist order
which, unless overturned by a court on review or unless the
period for review, which is 60 days, has expired, then becomes
enforceable.
This case presents important questions of
3

1

administrative law and it requires the Court to answer a ques­

2

tion that might be stated as follows:

3

Court to decide whether during the pendency of an administra­

4

tive proceeding a district court that concededly cannot review

5

the sufficiency of what is alleged in the agency complaint to

6

constitute its reason to believe that certain firms have vio­

7

lated the law, can nevertheless determine whether the agency

8

in fact made the reason to believe determination that caused

9

it to file the complaint.

This case requires the

The case arises out of the following factual situa­

10
1 1

tion.

12

investigation to determine whether the structure of the petro­

13

leum industry caused it, or contributed to its engaging in

14

unfair trade practices.

The Federal Trade Commission in 1971 authorized an

The investigation was concerned with

competition, principally at the refining end of the petroleum
industry, and had very little to do with the crude oil or
importation end of it.
The method in which the staff conducted the investi­
gation consisted essentially of seeking information from
independent operators and not directly from the principal
vertically integrated corporations by calling in their officers
or by subpoenaing their records.

It also consisted of seeking

information from several governmental agencies that had the
responsibility of collecting data about the petroleum industry.

24

This began in 1971.
25

4

1

In 1973 when the nation first experienced an acute

2

fuel shortage, Senator Henry Jackson sent a letter to the

3

Federal Trade Commission Chairman requesting that within 30

4

days the Commission write a report on the relationship between

5

the structure of the petroleum industry and the shortage of

6

petroleum products that was afflicting the country. That

7

was May, 1973.

8
9

On July 6, 1973, the Federal Trade Commission sub­
mitted to Senator Jackson a commission report entitled,

10

"Preliminary Federal Trade Commission Staff Report

on its

1 1

Investigation of the Petroleum Industry."

12

that this report had not yet been evaluated by the Commission,

13

nor did the findings and conclusions necessarily reflect those

14

of the Commission.

15

undue publicity because it might jeopardize -subsequent prose­

16

cution .

And it indicated

It also asked that the report not be given

On July 13, seven days later, Senator Jackson

17

18

released the preliminary report for publication as a committee

19

report.

20

vious July 17 issued a report stating that it intended to file

21

a complaint, caused its complaint to be filed naming the

22

eight petroleum companies that were respondents before the

23

Commission and are respondents here, charging that they were

24

violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that

25

On July 18, then, the Commission, having on the pre­

it had reason to believe that that fact existed, and that it
5

1

was in the public interest to proceed to a hearing on the alle­

2

gations that the complaint set forth, describing the acts and

3

practices claimed to be in violation of the Act.

4

Standard Oil of California, one of the eight named

5

petroleum companies, moved the Commission to dismiss its com­

6

plaint on the grounds that the Commission did not have reason

7

to believe that this respondent had violated the law at the

8

time it issued the complaint, and that the proceeding was not

9

in the public interest.

10

1 1

The Commission denied these motions

by order of February 12, 1974.
Respondent then sought reconsideration of this order

12

and on June 4, 1974, the Commission denied the motion for

13

rehearing and reiterated its previous determination that the

14

adequacy of the Commission's "reason to believe" that a viola­

15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

tion of the law had occurred, and its belief that a proceeding
would be in the public interest, was not litigable.
The Commission staff then proceeded with discovery
to prepare to prove the allegations set forth in the adminis­
trative complaint and Standard Oil of California and the other
seven respondent petroleum companies vigorously resisted its
efforts for discovery.

Eleven months later, on May 1, 1975,

Standard Oil of California filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California
for declaratory relief, contending that the Federal Trade
Commission did not have reason to believe that a violation of

25

6

1

2
3
4

law had occurred at the time it filed its complaint.
QUESTION:

Are you going at some point to mention

the proceeding in Indiana?
MR. McCREE:

At your own time.

The proceeding in Indiana, Mr. Chief

5

Justice, was a similar proceeding brought by Standard Oil of

6

Indiana, another one of the eight respondents, also asserting

7

that the Commission did not have reason to believe that

8

tion 5 of the Act had been violated at the time it filed its

9

petition, its administrative complaint.

10

Sec­

That matter was decided as far as its result is

1 1

concerned favorably to the Commission, because the District

12

Court, although looking into the matter, concluded that the

13

Commission had reason to believe and therefore the Commission

14

was successful at the district court level.

15

noticed in that and dismissed, I believe, but there is no

16

Court of Appeals decision pending with reference to that, and

17

as far as I am aware that matter rests.

18

QUESTION:

19

holding on this case, if any?

20

MR. McCREE:

An appeal was

What would you say is the impact of that

Well, I think -- I think it has no

21

precedental value for this purpose, it just shows that another

22

district court thought that it could at that stage of the

23

administrative proceeding look into the adequacy of the reason

24

to believe standard, or look into whether the

25

in fact make the reason to believe determination.
7

Commission did

1

But it's not a precedent for us here.

As a matter

2

of fact, even more recently, in a case called Boise-Cascade,

3

that was decided last May, the -- I believe -- the District

4

Court for the District of Delaware decided that a district

5

court could not look into the sufficiency of a reason to be­

6

lieve determination.

7

against the Commission, certainly the Boise-Cascade case is a

8

precedent for the Commission.

9

even instructive to this Court, except for the favorable lan­

And if the Indiana case is a precedent

But we think that neither is

10

guage that we find in the Boise-Cascade case, which effectively

1 1

follows the language of the dissenting opinion in the matter

12

in the Northern District of California, where Standard Oil of

13

California filed the complaint to which I just made reference.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Solicitor General, Standard Oil of

15

California is the only one of the eight respondents before

16

us in this case.
MR. McCREE:

18

case;

yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

19

It is the only one before us in this

General McCree, in an administrative pro­

20

ceeding such as this, does the main information-seeking process

21

occur in the pleading stage or in the discovery stage?

22
23
24

25

That

is, could the Commission simply issue a complaint in the
language of the statute and serve it on the respondent and the
respondent simply file a general denial and then go to dis­
covery?
8

1

MR. McCREE:

I think not.

I think the Commission

2

must have reason to believe.

3

capriciously, and if the Justice's inquiry looks to that point,

4

I would say, it cannot do it capriciously.

5

son to believe, but it's our contention that what constitutes

6

reason to believe as the argument will develop is a matter

7

that is not reviewable by the Court, that if it's agency action

8

it is action committed to the discretion of the agency and

9

therefore is not reviewable.

10

I don't think it could do it

It must have rea­

We would liken it to prosecutorial discretion to

1 1

initiate a prosecution.

12

initiate a prosecution unless he had reason to believe that

13

there was some basis for it.

14

a court will not inquire into the reason why a prosecutor

15

decided to initiate a fraud proceeding.

16

QUESTION:

Responsibly, a prosecutor would not

But we submit that ordinarily

Wouldn't one go further than that in the

17

court system and say that if a prosecutor initiates a prose­

18

cution a defendant can't come in and have it dismissed on the

19

grounds that the prosecutor had no reason to believe that the

20
21

22
23
24

25

evidence would prove the case?
MR. McCREE:
quite agree.

That's right.

He cannot do that.

We

And we contend that he cannot do it here either.

The District Court for the Northern District of
California upon entertaining this complaint that asked for a
declaratory judgment and other relief proceeded essentially
9

1

to determine, first, that the sufficiency of the reason to

2

believe, the sufficiency of the facts that gave the

3

reason to believe as it recited was committed to agency dis­

4

cretion and was not reviewable for the district court. And

5

neither side disagrees with that determination.

6

dismissed the action brought before him.

Commission

He then

The Court of Appeals, however, for the 9th Circuit,

7

8

two members of a three-judge panel agreed first with the

9

determination of the district court, agreeing that the -- well,

10

I'm ahead of myself.

I'll take it step by step if I may.

First, it determined that it was agency action to

11

12

file the complaint, which is something with which we disagree

13

and I'll talk about it in a few moments.
Second, it determined that whether there was reason

14

15

to believe that the Act had been violated

16

committed to the discretion of the agency, and therefore under

17

the Administrative Procedures Act could not be reviewed by the

18

Court.

19

the Court of Appeals went on to decide that judicial review is

20

25

was agency action

However -- and we think it's a little extraordinary --

available with respect to whether the Commission did in fact
make a reason to believe determination, and that there was law
to apply, as this court used this phrase,

in Citizens to

Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, and it vacated the judgment of
dismissal and remanded the matter to the district judge with
instructions to find out, did the Commission in fact make a
10

1

reason to believe determination, which determination is unre-

2

viewable, as it decided.

3

matter confronts the Court this morning.

That's the status in which this

4

One judge dissented on the ground that the Commis­

5

sion's action initiating the administrative proceeding is in

6

essence an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and as such is

7

exempted from judicial review.

8

inquiry into whether the determination was in fact made would

9

require an impermissible probing into the mental processes of

He also said.that to permit an

10

the Commission and that it was something in which the Court

1 1

should not engage.
QUESTION:

12

Well, would it really require any probing

13

at all if five commissioners all signed a piece of paper and

14

verified it saying, we have reason to believe that the unfair

15

practices took place?

16

MR. McCREE:

Well, we contend that that's really what

17

we have here.

18

plaint purports to be issued pursuant to the authorization of

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

This complaint is regular on its face.

The com­

the Commission, the complaint recites that a reason to believe
determination was made, the complaint is attested to by the
Secretary of the Commission and is in every respect in proper
form.

Yet, the Court of Appeals did what we regard as an

extraordinary thing and suggests that the complaint

that was

filed before the district court is sufficient to raise that
question.
11

1

And I think it’s very much like questioning an in­

2

dictment handed down by a grand jury.

3

it's signed by the foreman of the grand jury, recites that a

4

majority of the grand jurors agree to the allegations set

5

forth in the indictment, and then the defendant is permitted,

6

before any proof is introduced, to say, I don't think they

7

really agreed to that.

8

whether or not that happened.

9

QUESTION:

It’s in proper form,

And the court would investigate to see

Could there be a preliminary proceeding

10

to inquire into the truth of whether a grand jury had ever

1 1

indeed handed down, or whether, on the contrary, a fraud was

12

being perpetrated on the court?

13

MR. McCREE:

I think perhaps in an extraordinary

14

circumstance, but when the indictment is fair on its face,

15

there's no suggestion that it's a forgery, there's no sugges­

16

tion that it was altered, it just relates to the mental pro­

17

cesses of the grand juror, which is exactly what we have here.

18
19

What respondent, Standard Oil of California, asserts,
essentially, is that the decision to file the administrative

20

complaint was motivated politically because of the intervention

21

of Senator Jackson who made this inquiry.

22
23
24

25

And that is really

the essence of it.
QUESTION:

May I ask you of your interpretation of

the 9th Circuit opinion, assuming the following.

Assume that

somehow or other the facts came to light and there was in fact
12

1

political motivation at the time the complaint was filed.

2

But by the time the Commission responded to the motion to dis­

3

miss the complaint, which I understand they did some months

4

later, they had reviewed the matter and then decided in an

5

orderly way at a meeting of the full Commission that there was

6

then reason to believe the case should go forward.

7

didn't have the reason to believe it at the time they filed

8

the complaint.

9

9th Circuit would say should be done about that?

But they

What do you think the Court of Appeals for the
Would they

10

make you dismiss the complaint and start all over and file a

1 1

new complaint?
MR. McCREE:

12

Well, it certainly would be a waste of

13

judicial time and a waste of administrative time to do that,

14

because they could do exactly what you suggest.

15

dismiss it and have a resolution.
QUESTION:

16

They could

As a matter of fact --

They may in effect be contending that

17

-- this is some years ago, but in all these years the Commis­

18

sion still hasn't made its determination that there's reason

19

to believe there's a violation.

20
21
22
23
24

25

alive.

They're still keeping the case

Is that what they would -MR. McCREE:

It's certainly passing strange that the

Commission would keep it alive under all those circumstances
if it had not at least ratified its act of filing it.
QUESTION:

Doesn't the very fact you're here defend­

ing what the Commission did implicitly indicate that somebody
13

1

has reason to believe the case ought to go forward.

2

MR. McCREE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I certainly agree

3

with that.

4

about it, and we think this is one of the reasons why the

5

decision to file the complaint should be insulated from judi­

6

cial review, because if the Commission recognized that it made

7

a mistake, we would expect it to behave responsibly and to

8

strike its complaint.

9

a matter of fact it's proceeded here through some very arduous

We wouldn't be here if the Commission had any doubt

The fact that it proceeds with it -- as

10

and not too productive discovery.

1 1

been almost 400 proceedings relating to the Commission's effort to

12

get discovery in this matter, and that there have been 14 or 15

13

lawsuits filed, matters of various sorts, to quash subpoenas,

14

the matter to which the Chief Justice referred in the Northern

15

District of Indiana, and this matter, and others.

16

Commission tried to establish something, that curiously enough

17

someone said, they didn't really intend to file.

18
19

QUESTION:

I'm advised that there have

While'the

Could you, Mr. Solicitor General, concede

arguendo -- and assume, arguendo -- that the Commission may

20

have acted with unseemly haste in responding to the congres­

21

sional inquiry and yet take the position that that has nothing

22

to do with the central issue?

23
24

25

MR. McCREE:

Arguendo, Mr. Chief Justice, I can make

that concession, and I think this happens sometimes in the
criminal area where a prosecution takes place because the
14

1

public is insistent upon the solving of some crime that vexes

2

it, and sometimes perhaps in those instances a grand jury may

3

return an indictment with unseemly haste.

4

course, becomes whether they actually did it, and the proof

5

of the sufficiency of it comes in its capacity to sustain it

6

later on.

The question, of

And if the Commission in this case cannot sustain

7

8

these allegations, of course there will be no cease and desist

9

order, which is the sanction that the Commission would impose

10

if its staff in presenting evidence could establish these

1 1

facts.

12

which is a very vague standard.

13

And that’s a higher standard than reason to believe,

Also, I would like to comment too, further stimulated

14

by the Chief Justice's question, that the fact that there was

15

a political inquiry doesn't of itself vitiate the proceeding or

16

suggest that there's not reason to believe.

17

responsibility for the same matters that the Federal Trade

18

Commission has, to see that there are not anticompetitive

19

activities in

inquiry of an agency that was created with the primary func­

21

tion to oversee these matters seems to me the most responsible

the petroleum market.

The Congress has

And for it to make an

kind of legislative action that could take place.

And nowhere

does Standard Oil of California assert that Senator Jackson
required them to file an action, or even suggested that they
file an action.

His was an inquiry about their investigation,
15

1

which commenced in 1971 and it proceeded for 17 months before

2

the fuel crisis stimulated him in his capacity as Chairman of

3

the Permanent Investigations Subcommittee of the Senate, to

4

make this inquiry.
Our argument, essentially, is as follows.

5

First, we

6

suggest that the issuance of an administrative complaint is not

7

agency action within the meaning of the Administrative Proce­

8

dure Act.
QUESTION:

9

10

Is that point, Mr. Solicitor General,

preserved in the petition for certiorari, do you think?
MR. McCREE:

1 1

We think it is.

I believe, Mr. Justice

12

Blackmun, your question probably results from the fact that

13

we did not use that very language when we filed our petition,

14

but we did use this language, that the matter is not final

15

agency action.

16

to be agency action in the first place, and so the first -QUESTION:

17

18

21

MR. McCREE:

24

It is ultimately, except it can't -- if

it's not agency action at all, it can't be final agency action,
and we suggest that -QUESTION:

22
23

That really is directed at a different

point, isn't it, not final agency action?

19

20

Now, if it's to be final agency action, it has

Well, would you be as satisfied with

winning on the argument you've made up to now as you would on
this one?
MR. McCREE:

I would prefer to win on the argument

25

16

1

I've made up to now.

2
3

QUESTION:
discretion?
MR. McCREE:

4

5

Namely, that it's committed to agency

That it's committed to agency discretion

and that it is not reviewable.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. McCREE:

Even though it's agency action?
If the Court should decide this is agen­

8

cy action and wishes to agree with our contention that it's

9

committed to agency discretion, we'd be very pleased to win on

10

that basis.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

Why do we need to deal with that at all,

or do we?
MR. McCREE:

13

I'm pleased to have the Court make that

14

inquiry

15

isn't agency action, because the Administrative Procedures Act

16

defines agency action as a number of things, none of which

17

remotely resembles the filing of a complaint.
QUESTION:

18
19

20

23
24

Well, if it isn't subject to judicial

review, then no matter how we describe it it isn't final agency
action.

Is that not so?
MR. McCREE:

21

22

but I'm just suggesting that on proper analysis it

That's entirely correct.

Mr. Chief

Justice, I see I have about five minutes remaining.

With the

permission of the Court I would like to reserve that time for
rebuttal.

Thank you, sir.
MR.CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

case were orders which denied respondents any discovery until
after complaint counsel had completed their discovery and had
perhaps further defined the issues in the case.
The suit before

Judge McNagny contended that such a

25

18

1

denial of discovery per se was a denial of due process in

2

the circumstances of the litigation.

3

with that and he voided it, the two orders in question, of the

4

administrative law judge, and directed that the administrative

5

law judge should reconsider discovery applications by the

6

respondents.

7

Judge McNagny agreed

I think from that, Mr. Chief Justice, that you'll

8

understand that the issue there is entirely disparate from the

9

issue presented here today.

It was made explicitly clear in

10

the pleadings in the Indiana case that no challenge was being

1 1

made to the reason to believe of the Commission at the time it

12

issued the complaint in the case.

13

in that case.

14

that Standard of California had violated Section 5 before the

15

complaint'issued is the issue that is presented in this case

16

exclusively.

4

That is without any basis to

The Commission's position in fhe case is that whe­

5

ther it had reason to believe that Standard had violated

6

Section 5 is not subject to review in any court at any time,

7

and that the basis for its action, however invidious and unre­

8

lated to statutory requirement, may never be examined by a

9

court.

That Commission assertion of unreviewable prerogative

10

cannot be squared with due process safeguards or the rule of

11

law.
QUESTION:

12

I take it you would necessarily reject

13

any analogy between the indictments by a grand jury and the

14

action taken here?
MR. SEARS:

15

I'd like to comment on that, Mr. Chief

16

Justice.

17

proper showing, an examination may be made into the question

18

of whether an indictment has been handed down without any evi­

23
24

25

The cases which I cite in our brief show that upon a

that the defendant committed the crime.

That kind of examina­

tion may be made on a proper showing.
I am asserting the same line of reasoning here,
adding only this comment, that this is a stronger case for
examining the basis for Commission action.

The reason is that

conceptually the grand jury stands between the prosecutor and
20

1

the citizen charged with crime --

Mr. Sears, how do you distinguish the

MR. SEARS:

May I just finish my sentence, Your

Honor?

QUESTION:

7

MR. SEARS:

Certainly.
-- whereas in this case obviously the

8

Commission itself is prosecutor here as well as judge under

9

the FTC Act and the Commission acts directly upon the citizens,

10

the person.

1 1

reason for this Court to look at the absence of basis for

12

Commission action.

13

That's why I'm suggesting this is a stronger

Now, sir, Costello.

As I have stated and quoted in

14

my brief, Justice Burton's concurring opinion in that case

15

makes explicit that there is a distinction between an examina­

16

tion into the adequacy or the sufficiency of evidence on the

17

one hand and the absence of evidence, a no-evidence situation,

18

no evidence to relate conduct of defendant to commission of

19

offense,on the other hand.

20
21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

Do you suggest then that in a federal

court a defendant could come in and move to dismiss an indict­
ment on the ground that the Government simply had no evidence
to prove its case?
MR. SEARS:

Again, sir, as the cases which I have

cited in my brief demonstrate, that is done.
21

1

2

MR. SEARS:

I submit, sir, that Costello from this

Court supports that, that it directly supports that.

Are there any cases from this Court sup­

port that?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

I'm not familiar standing here with Thompson

That was a case of no relevant evidence

whatsoever.
MR. SEARS:

12

In that case, Your Honor, it supports

QUESTION:

2

MR. SEARS:

Would they go that far?
Let me put it a little differently, if I

might.

4

thought to itself if, here we've had a winter of people

5

shivering in their homes with fuel oil shortages, and we've

6

had a spring when people are cursing in lines in gas stations

7

and we think that it might be a good idea to jump on the band­

8

wagon, to get out front, and let people know that we are trying

9

to do something to confront a situation of obvious public

10

concern.
QUESTION:

1 1

12

Let me suggest that what the Commission more likely

So that Senator Jackson's interest was no

part of this?
MR. SEARS:

13

No, I don't say that either, sir.

Again,

14

as I've laid out in my complaint in the case,

15

Senator Jackson's actions were highly significant.

16

brought to bear in a specific time period a focus of pressure

17

on the Commission which led it to act and which, I suggest,

18

led it to act rashly and unlawfully, and that's why this case

19

is here.

25

QUESTION:

I

gather

your

argument

I think that
They

does

but your argument does suggest that they knew that they had
absolutely no evidence to support the issuance of the complaint,
no reason to believe.
MR. SEARS:

Well, let me -- let me talk around the

corners of that a little bit.

I am not here to charge
23

1

Commissioners with bad faith, with -- for example, respondingtc

2

Your Honor's suggestion thatTthey somehow acted fraudulently in

3

the circumstances, knowing that they had no basis on which to

4

act.

5

do that, that's not the drive of the case.

6

case is that, in fact, the Commissioners had no basis on which

7

to relate conduct of the Standard Oil Company of California in

8

the relevant geographic area of the East and Gulf Coast states

9

of the United States, to a violation of Section 5 of the FTC

10

Act.

I'm not here suggesting or arguing that.

I don't need to

The drive of the

That is my contention.
QUESTION:

1 1

Mr. Sears, supposing that we affirm the

12

9th Circuit?

13

Commissioners file an affidavit in that court which says in

14

substance, well, they're right, we jumped the gun, we had

15

suspicion but we didn't have any facts, but we've been studying

16

the matter during the last couple of years and we are now

17

satisfied there is reason to believe Standard has violated

18

the law.

21

22
23
24

25

What should the District Court do?
MR. SEARS:

19

20

The case is sent back to District Court and the

Let me state it in my view, sir, what it

is that the Commission should do.

The Commission should with

draw the complaint, for the law is perfectly clear on this
point.

The statute is explicit that a complaint may be issued

by the Commissioner only upon the basis of a reason to believe
determination that the respondent has violated Section 5.

The

answer to your question is, they must withdraw the complaint.
24

1

QUESTION:

Say they add to their affidavit that we

2

could remedy this situation either by withdrawing the complaint

3

or by amending the complaint and saying that as of the present

4

we have reason to believe there is a violation.

5

to lose the benefit of the discovery we've had, so it's sort

6

of a futile gesture to start all over.

7

by law to move to withdraw the complaint?
MR. SEARS:

8
9

We don't want

Are they still required

They must, for the reason I've already

stated, an explicit legal

requirement, they must withdraw

10

the present complaint.

Now, what, sir, the Commission might

1 1

elect to do in that circumstance is obviously something I

12

would not predict.

13

one of the very important considerations that -exists here,

14

is that this case, if it were to proceed on this unlawfully

15

issued complaint, would conduct an examination into a period

16

of time prior to July, 1973, when the complaint issued.

17

That's the period on which it must make a determination of

18

liabilities, as Your Honor well knows.

One of the extraordinary circumstances,

As your Honor equally well knows, the petroleum world

19

20

today is an entirely new world from what it was prior to July

21

1973.

22
23
24

25

We have a Department of Energy, 20,000 employees plus;

we have pervasive regulation of the industry; the entire
international and national oil world is a new world.

In that

circumstance, sir, I don't know what the Commission might choos e
to do.

It is not going to lose anything which it has done to
25

1

date, however.

2

All the Commission has done to date in this case is to secure

3

production of massive volumes of documents from the eight

4

respondents.

5

the complaint were properly to be withdrawn.

6

available to the Commission, to be applied in what would then

7

be a proper investigation of what the world of today is like.

8

If they chose after that examination to reissue a complaint

9

on a proper basis, they then could do that.

Let me make that very clear to Your Honor.

Those documents are not going to disappear if

QUESTION:

10

They would remain

Sir?

They could do it for the period prior to

1 1

1973, couldn't they?

I have not made myself fully clear, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. SEARS:
Commission,

Not to me.
Well, I am saying to you, sir, that the

the Commission may or may not today have reason to

believe that Standard of California has violated the law.

It

may assert that, but I'm suggesting to Your Honor that you are
assuming something that very plainly is not in evidence.
QUESTION:

Well, it is in evidence if the Commission
26

1

resisted your motion to dismiss and they're still defending the ir

2

right to prosecute this action, and we presume that public

3

agencies are acting in good faith for the most part; they are

4

public officers and I think there is some' presumption of

5

validity to their action.

6

MR. SEARS:

There is a presumption of regularity,

7

which is, as Your Honor knows, a rebuttable presumption, and

8

the point of this complaint is that Standard of California has

9

shown a proper basis for a judicial inquiry into whether the

10

Commission, when it issued the complaint, did have any basis

11

for a reason to believe determination.
QUESTION:

12

13

I take it you concede that it's regular on

The complaint is regular on its face?
MR. SEARS:

14

That's exactly the --

The complaint includes as all Commission

15

complaints include, a recital, a formal recital at the outset,

16

that there has been a finding of reason tb believe, and that the

17

action is in the public interest.

18

again is that there has been a basis shown, a prima facie

19

basis for a judicial inquiry shown in the allegations of

The contention here, sir,

20

Standard's complaint, indicating that in this extraordinary

21

instance -- and to repeat, there were extraordinary circum­

22

stances that preceded the issuance of the complaint of July,

23
24

25

1973 .
In this instance those are truly bare recitals.
There is not a fact behind them which would serve to relate
27

1

the conduct of the Standard Oil Company of California in the

2

relevant area on the one hand, to a violation of Section 5 on

3

the other.

4

QUESTION:

-Mr. Sears, let me try it another way.

5

If the letter from Senator Jackson was not here, would you be

6

here?
MR. SEARS:

7

8
9

Honor.

That's an interesting question, Your

I think that the answer is, yes, I would still be here.
QUESTION:

And what would you be alleging or indi(

10
1 1

eating or urgirlg?
MR. SEARS:

I'll tell you why I hesitated:

because

12

it is the existence of the Jackson letter coupled with subse­

13

quent developments of public record that provided very appar­

14

ent reason for inquiry into what if anything it was the Com­

15

mission had done.

16

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

Where do you get the right to inquire

into the motive of a Government agency?
MR. SEARS:

There may be an inquiry into motive of

an agency in appropriate cases, sir.

There may be.

I think

I need not go that far in this case.

The core of this case

goes to the absence of any basis for Commission action.
That's what this case goes -- as Your Honor very well knows,
federal judges make determinations of whether there is probable
cause to believe that the defendant committed a crime, every
day of their lives.

And they make those determinations without:
28

1

any suggestion from a prosecutor that that kind of an evalua­

2

tion of whether there is or is not basis for probable cause,

3

either invades the prosecutor's mental processes, or incurs

4

the proper exercise of his prosecutorial discretion.

5

Your Honor well knows that isn't the case.

6

reviews are made every day.

different issue.

QUESTION:

I thought that's what you said.

3

QUESTION:

But if we rule in your favor, don't we

4

have to say that every time a respondent is made a party by

5

the Federal Trade Commission that party has a right to go into

6

Federal District Court before there's been any trial before the

7

administrative law judge and say, the agency doesn't have any

8

facts to back up its allegations?
HR. SEARS:

9

Your Honor, one of the great things

10

about the United States is that the courts are open to liti­

1 1

gants.

12

I am not aware, to take a federal example, that there has been

13

any abuse of the provisions of Rule 12 of the .Federal Rules of

14

Criminal Procedure,.which permit an examination into absence

15

of probable cause to support either information or indictment.

16

I'm not aware that there has been any abuse of Rule 11 of

17
18
19

20

21
22
23

There may be other claims of this kind advanced, but

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which permits an immediate
inquiry into whether there was any support for the filing of
the complaint.

I'm not aware that that exists, Your Honor.

And, of course, two more factors that apply here.
What has been approved by'the Court of Appeals in this case?
And I think what was approved by this Court in Dunlop v.
Bachowski is a very narrow scope of review.

It is a most

stringent standard which we must meet in this case, or which
24

other prospective litigants must make in some other case.
25

30

1

I think that the threat of some kind of massive

2

infusion of cases into this judicial system is simply not true

3

in fact.

4

QUESTION:

Suppose the record were opened and we

5

knew or it was stipulated that three Commissioners thought

6

there was reason to believe, and two thought there was not

What impact would

The Federal Trade Commission Act permits

12

complaints to issue on the vote of three Commissioners.

14

of your question, that the three Commissioners had factual

15

foundation for their determination of reason to believe.

me assume that with you.

MR. SEARS:

QUESTION::

What did the Court of Appeals hold?

7

thing that was reviewable was whether they had purported to

8

make the determination.

MR. SEARS:

QUESTION:

MR. SEARS:

What did you claim

Let me state what my understanding of

the narrow scope of review directed by the 9th Circuit is.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SEARS:

17

What did it reject?

that it rejected?

13
14

I thought

that perhaps --

1 1

12

Well, let me address that.

All right.
We have to go to the court's language,

of course.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SEARS:

All right.
The court said this in its opinion:

20

"A restriction on the FTC's discretion is embodied in the very

21

terms of 15 U.S.C. 45(b).

22

reason to believe determination that the law has been violated.

23
24

25

The FTC must first in fact make a

See Hunt Foods and Industries, 286 F.2d 803, 806.

At that

page the relevant sentence from the Hunt Foods case, also a
9th Circuit decision, says, "The!' Commission cannot have reason
32

1

to believe unless it is in possession of facts warranting such

2

a belief."

3

Now, coming back to where we started on this, Your

4

Honor, yes, I am saying that the reason to believe review, that

5

very narrow review, open to the District Court, is comparable

6

to the very narrow review permitted to a district judge of

7

whether there is probable cause.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, I had misunderstood then, apparently.

I thought the Court of Appeals said that whether or not there

10

was actually probable cause to issue the complaint, or reason­

1 1

able cause to issue the complaint, it wasn't reviewable.

12

whether or not the Commission had made such a determination

13

was an open issue.

14

MR. SEARS:

15

QUESTION:

But

I think not, Your Honor, for the reason —
Well, let's suppose for the moment that

16

I am correct in reading the Court of Appeals opinion the way

17

I do.

18

you're now urging, as a respondent?

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

Just suppose that.

MR. SEARS:
QUESTION:

Would you be entitled to urge what

If I may, sir, I know no way -Is there -- do you suppose there's an

answer to my question, or do you have an answer for it?
MR. SEARS:

The answer to your question, sir, is,

yes, I would be entitled to proceed to explore, as the 9th
Circuit said, as you interpret the opinion, whether a determi­
nation of reason to believe was made by the Commissioner.
33

1

2

QUESTION:

Yes, whether a determination had been

made, not whether it was a correct determination?

3

MR. SEARS:

That’s correct, Your Honor; yes, sir.

4

QUESTION:

But you are now urging that it is also

5

open to a court in this case to say whether the determination

6

was correct?

7

MR. SEARS:

Not whether it was correct in the opinion

8

of the District Court.

And again, the 9th Circuit made this

9

explicit in its opinion.

And that's -- the 9th Circuit said

10

that the District Court, on review, may not substitute its

1 1

view of what constitutes a violation of Section 5 for that of

12

the Federal Trade Commission.

13

I'm saying there is such a very narrow scope of review that

14

is directed by the 9th Circuit.

15

review that was directed by this Court in Dunlop v. Bachowski.

16

QUESTION:

It said that, and that's why

It is the kind of very narrow

Is this what the Court of Appeals said?

17

"Under this standard a determination by the FTC that there is
