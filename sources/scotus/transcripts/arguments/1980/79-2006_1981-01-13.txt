ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

13

quired prior to embarking on an over-the-road trip to conduct

a rigorous pre-trip safety inspection of their vehicle.

in good working order.

Accordingly, the drivers have filed a series of grievances
alleging that ABF's refusal violates the terms of their con­
tract.

These grievances, in turn, were processed by the union

which processed them through the joint grievance committee

procedures spelled out in the collective bargaining agreement.
Despite the fact that the lower courts have found

2
3

that applying a literal reading of the collective bargaining

agreement this time would be compensable, the joint grievance

committees rejected the drivers' grievances.

with no further remedy left under the contract, petitioners

filed suit in March, 1977, alleging -QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say there was no

other remedy available?
MR. VLADECK:

10

Under their contract.

Petitioners --

1 1

the grievances had been pursued through final stage of the

12

grievance procedure set forth in the contract.

13

petitioners filed suit in district court, alleging among other

14

things that ABF's refusal to compensate them for this time

violated the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Stan­
dards Act.

contract?
MR. VLADECK:

Yes, Your Honor, there was an allega­

QUESTION:

But that isn't what this case is about?

MR. VLADECK:
here, Your Honor.

Well, we have not pressed that Issue

Despite the fact that defendants have

pressed the Fair Labor Standards Act issue, however, neither
24

court below reached the merit of that question.
25

4

Rather, both

1

courts held instead that the prior submission of their con­

2

tract-based grievance claim to arbitration barred the right to

3

have court review of their statutory claim under the Fair

4

Labor Standards Act.

5

Accordingly, the sole question presented here is

6

whether submission of their contract claim to the joint

grievance committee

9

barred subsequent court review of their

Petitioners submit that the courthouse door must

10

remain open to review the merits of their statutory claims,

1 1

regardless of whether there has been a prior arbitration award

12

and that the resolution of the issue presented here is con­

13

trolled by two principles.

14

15
16

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

The first principle that I will discuss is that the
decision below was inconsistent with the provisions of the
Fair Labor Standards Act itself.

This Court in a series of

decisions has held that rights conferred under the Fair Labor
Standards Act cannot be waived or bargained away as part of
the collective bargaining process.
QUESTION:

Then you necessarily mean that an agree­

ment to arbitrate is bargaining away those rights?
MR. VLADECK:

No, Your Honor, what my contention

here is, is that this contract as construed by the joint
grievance committees violates the Fair Labor Standards Act,
and what petitioners want is the right to go into court to

25

5

1

litigate that question under the statute.
QUESTION:

2

And your contention would be not that the

3

arbitrator had applied an improper reading of the contract but

4

that even if the contract had expressly said that this is the

5

wages we will be paid and we will not be paid for the time

6

you claim,the federal law simply prohibits that kind of con­

7

tract?

8

HR. VLADECK:

9

The second point that I will turn to later on is

10
11

that the decision below cannot be reconciled with this Court's
decision in the Gardner-Denver decision.
QUESTION:

12

QUESTION:

That's right.

This is not a Title VII

case, is it?
MR. VLADECK:

17

18

Gardner-Denver was a Title VII case,

Your Honor.

15
16

What kind of a case was Gardner-Denver?

MR. VLADECK:

13
14

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's correct, Your Honor, but

petitioners' position is that the standard of nonpreclusion
of court review of federally granted rights should govern in

19

this case, and as I will argue later, the statutes are paralie
20

in all material respects and those parallels demonstrate that
21

Gardner-Denver should govern in this case as well.

But let

22

me first turn to my argument under the statute.
23

The Fair Labor Standards

Act is a broadly remedial

24

statute.

It embodies a number of distinct and diverse policy

25

6

1

judgments made by Congress.

Among other things the Act sets

2

forth a strict policy of guaranteed minimum wage compensation

3

for all workers covered by the Act.

4

certain workers the right to premium pay for overtime work.

5

To insure effective enforcement of the statute, Congress has

6

authorized courts to

7

double damages, attorneys' fees, injunctive relief, back pay

8

awards in cases where the employee prevails.

In addition, it grants

impose a variety of remedies, including

The role of these provisions is dual.

9

Congress used

10

them to both determine employer violations and to insure that

1 1

workers who had been injured

12

13
14

15
16

17

by. Fair

Labor ■ Standards Act

violations were fully compensated for their injuries.
Because of the remedial nature of the statute, this Court has
often recognized that rights conferred by the Fair Labor
Standards Act can neither be waived nor bargained away during
the course of the collective bargaining process.

Indeed, this

Court has expressly held that any customer contract that falls
short of these policies -- for example, an agreement to pay
less than minimum wages -- cannot be used to deprive workers
of their statutory rights.

20

Nonetheless, in the face of these decisions, the
21

court below's decision effectively insulates from judicial
22

scrutiny the contract which we contend does precisely that:
23

cuts back on petitioners' right to certain minimum wage com­
24

pensation.

Under the lower court's theory, arbitration, which

25

7

1

is, as this Court has recognized, an extension of the collec­

2

tive bargaining process, can be used to foreclose employees'

3

right to sue under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

4

tioners submit that this result simply cannot be reconciled

5

with this Court's prior decisions.
QUESTION:

6

And peti­

Well, we have held, haven't we, in a

7

recent case that a collective bargaining contract could over­

8

ride the Norris-La Guardia Act?
MR. VLADECK:

9

10

QUESTION:

1 1

that line of cases?

In Boyd's Market and Buffalo Forge and

MR. VLADECK:

12

I'm not familiar with that case.

Well, Your Honor, we're talking here

13

about statutory rights that are conferred on an individual

14

worker.

15
16
17

18
19

These are not the majoritarian rights that are derived

from a collective bargaining agreement.

And our position is

that where rights are expressly conferred by Congress and
Congress has provided that the courts should enforce those
rights, an arbitration decision or a collective bargaining
agreement cannot cut back on those statutory rights.
QUESTION:

But under the Norris-La Guardia Act,

20
21

22

there were stringent restrictions placed on injunction.
Injunctions run against individuals as well as unions, and
yet in some of our later cases we said that those stringent

23

restrictions could be altered by the provisions of a collec­
24

tive bargaining agreement.
25

8

MR. VLADECK:

1

I am aware of no decision of this

2

Court which supports the proposition that an arbitration award

3

or a contract can cut back on an employee's rights that have

4

been both conferred directly by statute and are enforcable by

5

that statute through the courts.

And that is this case.

The point that I'm trying to make is that unless

6
7

the Fair Labor Standards Act claim can be brought into court

8

after an arbitration award, then the Act affords employees

9

nothing more than they would derive from the collective bar­

10

gaining agreement.

1 1

ders the Fair Labor Standards Act a nullity insofar as it

12
13

applies to workers who are covered by collective bargaining
agreement.
The second point I want to make under the statute --

And if

you had meant not to nullify the statute, you could have said
so in the contract.
MR. VLADECK:

Well, Your Honor --

20

QUESTION:

Or you could have said that you did, one

21

way or the other. That could have been put in the contract.
22

MR. VLADECK:

Your Honor, a provision

could cer­

tainly have been put in the contract, but as this Court has

17

Well, I agree with Your Honor that it

That's correct, Your Honor.

That is progress.

MR. VLADECK:

But in Gardner-Denver, the statutory

right was exactly identical to the contractual provision.
The people who wrote the collective bargaining agreement
cribbed precisely from Title VII.

Nonetheless, this Court

20

unanimously held that a prior arbitration decision, even under

21

the terms of a collective bargaining agreement that were pre­

22

cisely identical to the statute, did not relieve the federal

23

courts from their duty to examine the statutory claim on the

24

merits.

25

question is that even if the contract had borrowed precisely

So, I guess in a longwinded sense, my answer to your

2

would nonetheless be required to review the merits of that

3

decision, to review the merits of the statutory claim, to make

4

sure that the rights had not been impaired.

QUESTION:

Mr. Vladeck, do you think this case from

your point of view is a harder one than Gardner-Denver?

7

all, it does affect laches; Gardner-Denver didn't.

MR. VLADECK:

After

Well, in some respects, Your Honor, I

think it's an easier case.

Why don't I talk about that first?

10

It's an easier case because unlike Gardner-Denver, where

11

Congress had set up an elaborate mechanism of dispute resolu­

12

13

15
16

17

18
19

tion prior to court review, elaborate exhaustion requirements,
deferrals to state agencies,
Mohasco decision last term.

as this Court elaborated in the
There is nothing in the Fair

Labor Standards Act which bars immediate employee access to
the courts.
Now, getting back to the thrust of your question,
I think that that was one of the reasons the lower court ruled
against us.

That is,

that they distinguished between the

nature of employee wage claims and claims of discrimination.
20

I think there are several answers to that.
21

In the first place, the decision that wage claims arc
22

somehow simpler or less complex than claims of discrimination
23

is inherently a difficult one.

I doubt strongly that this

24

Court wants to weigh the relative complexity of various
25

11

1

federal statutes in deciding how vigorous the Court should be

2

in enforcing a Congress command.
QUESTION:

3

Yet, our treatment of the prohibitions

4

against discrimination in age has been kind of a mixture, has

5

it not, of the Fair Labor Standards Act mechanisms and the

6

Title VII mechanisms, the Title VI mechanisms?
MR. VLADECK:

7

I think that's correct but I don't

8

think that the Court has been any less vigilant in protecting

9

those rights.

All that -- my point is that -- to begin with,

10

apart from the inherent difficulty in measuring the relative

1 1

complexities of various statutes, this Court -- it is a doubt­

12

ful proposition that this Court wants to waive the relative

13

importance of various remedial statutory schemes passed by

14

Congress.
But even assuming that that's relevant, that it's a

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22

relevant inquiry, here the long history of the Fair Labor
Standards Act and several of this Court's opinions recognizing
its vital policy underpinnings, strongly support petitioners'
contention that it merits equally vigilant court enforcement
as Title VII or any other remedial humanitarian protection of
statute.
QUESTION:

Do you think, if you prevail here, that

it will open the gates to a flood of wage claims in the
23
24

federal courts?
MR. VLADECK:

Your Honor, I think that that option

If they

10

imposed under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as the

11

superior procedural rights afforded in court review, may well

12

opt to go into court rather than to choose for arbitration.

13

It may well be that the most efficient answer that

14

this Court can provide is the same one it did in Gardner-Den-

15

ver, and that is to hold that regardless of whether the work­

16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

ers first employ the arbitration process, they retain the
right to go into court but,preserving the option of arbitra­
tion, which is relatively cheap and relatively quick.

It may

well be, as this Court observed in Gardner-Denver, employees
will opt first to arbitrate their grievances.

It may well be

in a large number of cases that whatever remedies they're en­
titled to under the contract will be adequate.

If that is the

case, then in a large class of cases there will be no ultimate
resort to the courts.
QUESTION:

21

QUESTION:

Well, they needn't confine their suit

22

24

MR. VLADECK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

25

16

I'd like

1

to turn for a moment to one of the arguments raised by the

2

court below in rejecting application of Gardner-Denver.

3

principal reason was, as I think Mr. Justice White suggested,

4

that wage claims are somehow less complex, or somehow less deserving

5

of protection by the courts than discrimination claims.

6

I think the fundamental problem with that approach is that

7

it rests on a misapprehension of the nature and Scope Of the

8

1 1
12

13
14

And

arbitrable process.
To begin with, arbitrators have no general authority

9

10

The

to apply the dictates of public law.

Rather, this Court has

made it clear in a number of decisions that an arbitration
award will be only enforced, only so long as it draws its
essence from the contract between the parties.

Moreover, the

arbitrator would not have the right to impose the broad range
of remedies Congress thought necessary to root out violations

15
16

of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The third reason is that the arbitration process is

17

not necessarily adequate procedurally to protect statutory
18

claims.

Let me give you an example here, where we're dealing

19

not with conventional arbitration but with a joint grievance
20

committee.
21

There was no neutral arbitrator.

Although there are

22

many grievances filed, there is no written decision.

Deti-

23

tioners do not even have a right to have counsel present dur­
24

ing the grievance hearing.

So there is no parallel between

25

17

1

the remedies and procedural safeguards that are afforded under

2

this procedure and in general under arbitration, as there are

3

in court procedures.

4

And lastly, the finality that is normally given to

5

arbitration award rests in part on the fact that arbitrators

6

are simply proctors of the bargain.

7

derive what it was that the parties privately bargaining for a

8

contract decided to agree upon.
In sharp contrast, under the Fair Labor Standards

9

10
1 1

12

13
14

Act, Congress has dictated what the standards are, and Con­
gress did so to provide for uniform nationwide standards.
There is no way that a patchwork of arbitration decisions
can implement Congress's policy embodied in the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
Moreover, the lower court

15
16

17

18
19

They are simply trying to

appeared to presume that

Fair Labor Standards Act rights could somehow be merged into
the rights that are accorded under the collective bargaining
agreement.

That is not the case.

The Fair Labor Standards

Act accords distinct rights; they do not form a part of the
collective bargaining process at all.

They exist independently

20

of the contract and they were conferred by Congress.

To rele­

21

gate those rights to the arbitral

forum would be in contra­

22

vention of what Congress spelled out in the Act itself in its
23

broad jurisdictional provisions.
24

QUESTION:

What if, Mr. Vladeck, you had a collective

25

18

bargaining agreement that set out various rates of pay and

2

hours and working conditions and then said, nothing herein con­

3

tained shall be understood to require any violation of the

and wasn't that proposal rejected?
MR. MAURRAS:

It was, Your Honor.

However, nothing

-- To the Contrary, the statute was left silent as to whether
it was exclusive for unorganized labor or included both.

It

did not thereafter go and specifically address the question.
This Court, subsequent to the adoption of the Act
in the Brooklyn Savings Bank case, acknowledged the fact that
the purpose for the Act was to protect the unorganized worker.
And although subsequent to the Brooklyn Savings Bank Case this
Court decided in Jewel Ridge and in the Anderson v. Mt. Clemens
case that acts which had not previously been determined

to be

work or compensable under the collective bargaining agreements
21

were compensable under the FLSA.

Congress responded to the

22

decisions of the Court by adopting the Portal-to-Portal Pay
23

Act, and in so doing stated in its findings and purposes that
24

it was necessary to adopt that Act because of judicial
25

21

1

interpretation that were in disregard of the customs, prac­
2

tices, and contracts

between employers and employees.

Again,

3

the Court,

subsequent to the Portal-to-Portal Act, decided the

4

case of Bay Ridge in which the Court stated that the FLSA re­
5

quired that certain activity be treated as overtime which had
6

not been treated as overtime in the contract.

The result of

7

the decision was to have the payment of FLSA overtime on top
8

of contractual overtime.
9

Congress again responded to that decision of the
10

Court with the 0vertime-on-0vertime Act, and in its statement
11

of findings for the necessity of the Act said that the claims
12

which had resulted from the Court's decision were windfalls
13

and were in derogation of the collective bargaining agreements
14

as they were understood by the parties.

Congress also said

15
that the arrangements for the overtime was the result of col­
16

lective bargaining, and that there was no evidence that it was
17

other than at arm's length.
18

So I would submit to the Court that because of the
19

subsequent actions of Congress in trying to restrict the deci­
20

sions so that the FLSA did not take precedence over legitimate
21

bona fide collective bargaining agreements, evidences the in­
22

tent of Congress to protect the unorganized worker as opposed
23

to organized labor.
24

The FLSA itself does not require that the action
25

for its enforcement be judicial in nature.

22

Section 216(b)

says that an action for damages for back wages or for liqui­

2

dated damages may be brought in a court of competent jurisdic­

acknowledged this idea that if Congress had wanted to exclude
arbitration as a method of resolving FLSA claims, that Con­
gress could have specifically so stated in the Act.

Now, the

petitioners have stated in their reply brief that Donahue is

Then I would submit to you that that cloud is more

apparent than real.

The cases the petitioners cite as creat­

There is nothing in the holdings which says tha

FLSA claims cannot be arbitrated if the parties voluntarily
19

agree to it in the context of a bona fide collective bargain­

21

And as a matter of fact, in one of the petitioners'
22

cases, the Colonial Hardwood Flooring case, that court says,
23

that while they hold that the Arbitration Act is not applica­
24

ble, that is not to say that the parties may not voluntarily

QUESTION:

Counsel, would you say the same thing as

to OSHA rights, if the parties agree to those?
MR. MAURRAS:

Your Honor, the policy considerations

behind OSHA rights I think are somewhat different from the

6

policy considerations the Congress may have of the persons

7

intended to be protected in the scope of the legislation.

8

I'm not prepared to make a blanket statement but I am prepared

to state that I believe that the Leone court is correct in

What about the Equal Pay Act?

Suppose the parties agreed that the

subject of equal pay should be subject to arbitration, and
that the statute should not apply.

Would that override the

provisions of the Equal Pay Act?
MR. MAURRAS:

Your Honor, again, I think it depends

18

on the policy considerations expressed by Congress as inter­
19

preted by this Court as to the relative weight to be given
20

the statute.

I'm not prepared to argue that the rights under

21

the Equal Pay Act are subject to waiver or subject to an agree­
22

ment to arbitrate.
23

QUESTION:

21

MR. MAURRAS:

If the joint board refused to acknow­

22

ledge the law of the land, whatever that law may be, if it
23

refused to acknowledge the law, I think it would be wrong.
24

QUESTION:

And the employee could go into court?

25

25

1

MR. MAURRAS:

Yes, sir, I do, and I think he could

2

go into court under existing decisions of this Court that he

3

had not been fairly represented, as I think that would clearly

4

fall under the concept of no fair representation, to which he

5

is entitled.
The arbitration provision

6

in this case is broad

7

enough to cover the FLSA claims.

Now, there have been prior

8

decisions of the Court which have said that where the scope

9

of the arbitration clause is limited, that claims that arise

10

under FLSA would not be considered because of the limited

1 1

scope of the arbitration clause.
Article 44 in this oontract says that any contro­

a very broad scope.

So we have an arbitration clause that has

QUESTION:

Well,

if he presented a claim for the

minimum wage under the statute and it was turned down, you say
he could go into court?
MR. MAURRAS:

Your Honor,

if

he

did,

he

could,

but I submit to you this committee would not do that if the
23

time involved -- and that's the threshold question -24

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

25

26

MR. MAURRAS:

1

I'll come to that in my argument.

2

But you have to reach that threshold question first, and in

3

this case the committee did reach that threshold question and

4

it was decided adversely to the employees.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR.

On the facts?

MAURRAS:

Yes,

sir.

So that you never get to

7

the second question.

8

agreement says that the employees are to be paid for all time

9

spent in the service of the employer.

10
1 1

12
13
14

17

18
19

And I would submit to

the Court that that is at least as broad,

if not broader,

than the FLSA requirement that the employee be paid for
time worked.

So that the language of what is required to be

paid, in the contract, is as broad as what the FLSA requires
for payment.
But before you get to that question, you first have

15
16

Article 50 in the collective bargaining

to determine, are the acts that the employees performed

work?

Now, to do that you have to go to the Muscoda test and deter­
mine whether or not this inspection meets the Muscoda require­
ments.

Muscoda required that physical exertion be involved,

that it be under the control of the employer, and that it be
20

necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer.
21

I submit to you that, as to the DOT safety inspection, at
22

least two of those elements are not met.

This inspection is

23

not under the control of the employer.

The necessity for it

24

is established by the DOT.

The elements which comprise the

inspection are established by the DOT.

2

inspection is prescribed by the DQT, and the person who makes

3

the inspection is prescribed by the DOT.

4

the employee makes the inspection, as the evidence showed,

5

he does so at his own pace, there is no supervision by the

company, he departs from where he has picked up his bills of

7

lading, goes out and at his own leisure he makes his inspec­

22

Yes, sir.

I think that the determina­

tion of whether the activities that the employee has engaged
in constitute time spent in the service of the employer are
exactly the kind of questions that arbitrators have tradi­
tionally decided.

It's a matter of hours worked, what consti­

tutes hours worked, it's a matter of the law of the shop,
previous history.
QUESTION: What if the employee filed a claim and

13

Sir?

said, filed a grievance and said, I worked 12 hours on June 1
and I was only paid for eight, and I am entitled to some over­
time.

And the employer said, you didn't work at all beyond

eight hours; you just didn't, you're a liar, you're lying.
And it went to arbitration and the arbitrator decided he only

of the case?

Your suggestion is that that's the end

MR. MAURRAS:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

That he shouldn't be able to relitigate

that fact in a court?
MR. MAURRAS:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

That's a correct statement of my position.
QUESTION:

Whereas, if the arbitrator had said,

well, I guess you did work ten hours, but the contract just

10

calls for you to be paid for eight, then you'd say the arbi­

1 1

trator would be in trouble?

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

MR. MAURRAS:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think you have

to come back and keep in context that the individual has a
right to this fair representation by the union, and if he -- in
the context of this contract, with the joint committee, you
just could not get the result that you have suggested.
QUESTION:

I take it that your argument goes only

so far as to say that when there is a decision on the facts
that that's what's binding?
MR. MAURRAS:

Yes, Your Honor,

Also, though, even

20

under this Court's decision in the Arguelles case, I think
21

the decision in the instant case should be affirmed.

Now,

22

Arguelles said that the employee had an option to either pro­
23

ceed with his contract remedy of arbitration or to proceed
24

under the statutory remedy and go directly to court.

QUESTION:

Mr. Maurras, I'm a little puzzled about

There wasn't any dispute about the facts,

was there?
MR. MAURRAS:
QUESTION:

Well, then, I don't understand how you're

23

saying that he decided a fact issue that's now binding and
24

precludes his litigating the statutory issue.

That's correct.

Well, you say that that determination is

just worked eight.

MR. MAURRAS:

12
13
14

15

16
17

Your Honor, if the factual basis for

the contractual claim and the factual basis for the statutory
claim are the same, then the decision of the arbitrator as to
what the effect of those facts are should have the same out­
come as to whether the claim is based on the statute or under
the contract.

given a second bite at the apple to relitigate it de novo.

The trial court here, while it did not go into the underlying

facts, whether or not the time was or was not compensable,

did give a two-day examination of whether or not the grievance

MR. MAURRAS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Well, don't you think there's a difference

between the board finding, or an arbitrator, as the case may
be, a finding:

the

activities he said he carried out he did

not carry out, therefore he performed no work;

and a finding:

yes, he carried these things on, but those things do not con­
stitute work?

That's the difficulty, as I see it. It is

that if the arbitrator decides that, yes, he did these things

area of whether the statute covers what in fact the arbitrator

MR. MAURRAS:

That's correct, Your Honor, and as I

have stated earlier, I believe, that the arbitrator or the
grievance committee has the right, if not the obligation, to
consider what the law is, in construing the contract,

the con­

tract cannot be construed in a vacuum or a void, it has to
take into consideration what the law is, to arrive at the cor­

There may not be, but arbitrators simply

Honor.

Again, I would just repeat myself, Your

Not since Title VII, and not since the Court has said

that the policy of the United States is such that arbitration
is not an acceptable method of solution.

And that must have

evidenced some dissatisfaction by the Court with the results

that the arbitrators were coming up with.

2

Finally,

I would turn to my position that failure to

3

file the written consents under 29 U.S.C.

216(b)

is fatal to

4

this action.

5

the named plaintiffs, or named parties, be submitted, in order

6

for the action to be commenced.

7

an action is not commenced until the complaint is filed and

8

the written consents are filed.

9

a situation in which the complaint is filed but the written

216(b) requires that the written consents of

Subsection (a) provides that

Subsection (b) contemplates

10

1 1

deemed to be commenced until those written consents are filed.

12

No written consents have ever been filed in this case.

13

I would submit to you that the parties are not properly before

14

the Court.

15

20

21
22

The purpose for the written consent under 216(b)

is for the party to opt into and be bound by the decision of
the Court.

That's not been done here.

Although this case

started as a combination of a class action under Rule 23 and
a collective action under 216(b), the dismissal by the plain­
tiffs, or rather by the court, of the claims under Rule 23
did not dispense with the necessity for the filing of the
written consents.
it was adopted:
amendments

216(b) has been amended three times since
1966,

1977, and 1974. And in none of those

was the requirement for the execution and filing of

23

a written consent ever alleviated.

So I would submit to you

24

that this action has not been properly commenced, and that

the plaintiffs are not properly before the Court.

Mr. Vladeck?

QUESTION:

MR.

Yes.

VLADECK:

Well, we address that at length in

10

our reply brief, and the short answer is that we disagree that

1 1

consents are required to be filed in noncollective actions.

12

The collective aspects of this case were dismissed by the

13

trial court early on.

to the Court, each of the plaintiffs in this action has

signed at least two sets of answers to interrogatories, I be­

in conduct of this litigation.

The court -- the circuit courts

have held that the signing of interrogatory answers is ade­
quate consent requirement.

And thus

we don't think that pro­

vides any basis whatsoever for the Court to dispose of this
action.

Moreover -QUESTION:

In any event, that wasn't one of the

questions even arguably comprised in the question presented
on the petition for writ of certiorari, was it?

15

MR. VLADECK:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

I'd just like to respond briefly to Justice Stevens'

17

question.

18

Labor Standards Act or not turns on the question under the

19

statute of whether it is integral or indispensable to the

20

21

22
23
24
25

Whether this time is compensable under the Fair

primary activity

of

the employer.

That phrase has been the

subject of nearly 40 years of judicial construction, a host
of Department of Labor regulations, case law, and so forth.
It is a statutory question, one that is typically resolved by
the courts.

I do not -- it is not akin to the question that

was put before the arbitrator in this case.
39

The second point that I'd like to address is the

1

2

legislative history.

Congress has never suggested in its

3

various deliberations on the Fair Labor Standards Act that a

4

contract providing below the minimum standards set forth in

5

the Act could be used to cut back on those minimum standards.

6

It has considered the applicability of collective bargaining

7

agreements many times, and it's never yet, never reached

8

that judgment.

9

The last point I would like to make is that counsel

10

for respondent has somehow equated the duty of fair represen­

1 1

tation standard with one about the correct interpretation of

12

a contract, and that standard be somehow engrafted upon a Fair

13

Labor Standards Act litigation.

14

dards.

15

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

There are two separate stan­

Congress has provided distinct statutory rights, rights

that are not merged into the 1 collective bargaining agreement.
Neither Congress nor this Court has ever even suggested that
a court must accept an arbitrator's resolution of a contract
claim as dispositive of an independent claim under the sta­
tute.

To the contrary, the decisions of this Court including

the decision in Gardner-Denver suggested the opposite, that
while contract rights are properly relegated to the arbitral
forum the courthouse door must stay open to resolve statutory
claims.

And I think this case bears out the wisdom of that

policy.

Because unless petitioners can get into court, there

is no way that they can challenge this pay practice as being
25

40

1

violative of their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
QUESTION:

2

It's a necessary predicate of your posi­

3

tion, is it not, under your question presented on page 3 of

4

your petition, that the Fair Labor Standards Act claim was

5

not in fact submitted to or passed upon by the grievance

6

committee?
MR. VLADECK:

7

Well, Your Honor, we now argue that

8

it is immaterial whether it was submitted or not.

9

we were trying to emphasize is that in this case it was not
