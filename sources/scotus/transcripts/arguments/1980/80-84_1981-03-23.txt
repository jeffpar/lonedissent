MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KRAMER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari from the Seventh

10

Circuit Court of Appeals, and it poses two broad issues.

1 1

The first of which is whether

12

try, whose stock in

13

recognize and disclose a security interest required to be

14

disclosed under the Truth-in-Lending Act.

15

the

entire

credit indus­

trade is security interests failed to

Secondly, this case poses the question of whether

16

even if such a hard to imagine mistake occurred, the ends of

17

justice are served by applying any such decision retroactively

18

to any case other than the one at bar.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Will these issues all disappear under

the new statute that was passed last year?
MR. KRAMER:

They will, Your Honor, but not with

22

respect to contracts that were written with respect to the

23

former statute, the present statute, which are now --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. KRAMER:

Cases like yours?
That's right, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

2

And what is the volume of those con­

tracts , have you any idea?
MR. KRAMER:

3

Well there are -- this contract that

4

is before the Court is the paradigm of the industries contract

It has --

QUESTION:
of contracts?

Well are we talking about millions

MR. KRAMER:

We are talking about millions of

contracts, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

1 1

MR. KRAMER:

This is the industries' form --

How many cases are pending?
There are -- we have no number as to

12

the precise number of cases which have raised this issue.

13

There have been, however, 27 decisions of various circuit

14

and district courts on this issue in 15 different cases that

15

have already reached the courts.

16

decision of this Court is on this issue will be the landmark

17

case in this area.

And depending on what this Court holds --

Which will remove the problem for the

future ?
MR. KRAMER:

Except for those millions of out­

standing contracts which presently exist.
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand it, under the
4

1

statute there's a fixed recovery, is there not, $1000 or

2

something?
MR. KRAMER:

3
4

Well Your Honor, for certain vio­

lations --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. KRAMER:

For this one.
For this one it is twice the amount --

7

penalty in -- twice the amount of the finance charge, up to

8

$1,000 per contract where the Truth-in-Lending Act is

9

violated.

And what the Court has before it now is the

10

industries' form --

11

QUESTION:

What you're suggesting is that

is that right?

I am most certainly saying that, Your

Is. there any

limitation of jurisdic­

tion of the federal courts for such suits?
MR. KRAMER:

No there is not, Your Honor.

state courts.

any defaulting debtor who is sued by a creditor to collect a

allegations.

which was an assignment of physical damage in unearned in­

court.

ment was a security interest that should have been not

10

disclosed on the back but on the front of the contract

11

under the Truth-in-Lending Act, but the District Court

12

looked at the normal meaning of the term security interest

13

in the Act, and looked at the usual and customary meaning

14

of those words as used in the contract, and found that there

15

was no security interest here in the assignment of unearned

physical damage insurance premiums, appearing on the back

of the contract.

where the Fifth Circuit rendered an opinion contrary to

that which we called to the attention of the District Court

and he reversed his position, eventually that reversal against

finding the violation of the Truth-in-Lending Act as to this

24

assignment clause was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit.

25

There are four uncontrovertible elements which

Act's security interest provision; the promulgation by the

the true nature of the interest, the assignment in­

in point on this issue.
QUESTION:

Now is that interpretation of the

Truth-in-Lending Act, or is it of the new statute -MR. KRAMER:

That is of the present Truth-in-Lending

Act, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Only?

It has nothing to do with the

simplification act?
MR. KRAMER:

Only.

It has nothing directly to do

with the simplification act, that is right.
QUESTION:

That's not too clear, I think.

In

chronology, it followed the adoption of the simplification
act, didn't it?
MR. KRAMER:

It did -- in -- follow, and indeed,

the Federal Reserve Board had the benefit of the intensive
Congressional hearings on the simplification act that led to
adoption of the simplification act.
8

And it adopted, after

1

there were these 27 separate decisions and 15 cases raising

2

this issue, the Federal Reserve Board also had the benefit

3

of those conflicting decisions, all before it held in its

4

proposed -- and it has not yet been adopted and it was not

5

finalized --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. KRAMER:

Now what was the gist of 173?
The gist of 173, Your Honor, was that

8

consumers are not aided by the disclosure of the assignment

9

clause of the physical damage insurance -- the insurance

10

premiums on the back of the contract -- they would not be

1 1

aided by putting that on the front of the contract to carry

12

out the purpose --

13
14
15

QUESTION:
assignment

But it wasn't explicit,, was it, that the

was not a security interest?
MR. KRAMER:

They held that although -- a technical

16

reading, as had been accomplished in certain courts in cer­

17

tain Circuit Courts could support that decision that that

18

would -- that such an incidental interest was not intended

19

by the Act, and that the purposes of the Act are better

20

served by not disclosing that provision as a security inter­

21

est on the front.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but yes or no -- did they interpret

23

a bulletin to say that the assignment was not a security

24

interest for purposes of the statute?

25

MR. KRAMER:

For purposes of the statute they said
9

1

it should not be disclosed as a security interest, yes,

2

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Kramer, I have some difficulty with

4

the various levels of regulations and the weight we should

5

give them.

mentioned in the 1981 promulgation, simply, at the end, says

the unpaid balance of the loan.

Under the

10

circumstances, we think it would be appropriate to disclose

1 1

the loan company's ownership of the policy as a type of

12

interest under 12 C.F.R. Section so-and-so.

13

trouble with that, originally, because it didn't seem to me

14

to state flatly it must be disclosed, the words it is appro­

15

priate to disclose

16

of caution -- but I was also troubled by the fact that the

17

1981 promulgation, the new regulation which goes in exactly

18

the opposite direction, didn't seem to refer to the 1970

19

regulation.

simply said may be in an excess

20

MR. KRAMER:

Your Honor, I don't believe that they

21

were exactly the same. The 1970

issued by the Board staff does certainly use the word appro­

24

than physical damage insurance on a vehicle, where the vehicle

25

is the real security interest in the transaction.

unofficial interpretation

However, it involved a different kind of insurance

10

And the

1

only security interest which appears in the 1970 unofficial

2

interpretation by the Board was the lender's security interest

3

in the insurance itself, which he was financing; it is not

4

at all the same as the transaction where the unearned insur­

5

ance premiums on physical damage insurance are entirely

6

incidental to the real security interest in the transaction

7

as we have here, which is the financed vehicle, which is

8

clearly disclosed on the front of the contract and it's

9

disclosure would be clouded if there were such an incidental

10

interest taken off of the back of the industries' form con­

1 1

tract and put on the front, to confuse the issue of what

12

security interest the consumer was giving up in the trans­

13

action .

14

QUESTION:

When you say they were different kinds

of insurance, the 1970 letter referred to life insurance?
MR. KRAMER:

Accidental death and dismemberment

17

policy where there was a single lifetime premium, Your

18

Honor, and the only thing that the creditor was taking in that

19

case was a security interest in the unearned premiums.

20

was no other security interest in that transaction.

QUESTION:

There

And the 1981 regulation would apply to

unearned premiums on physical damage -- insurance.
MR. KRAMER:

Physical damage insurance

on a vehicle

which is exactly what we have here.
QUESTION:

Why hasn't the '81 proposal been
11

1

finalized?

There just isn't time, or is it -MR. KRAMER:

2

No, Your Honor, it's very clear that

3

it is out of deference for this Court's authority.

4

the Federal Reserve Board under the Court's opinion in

5

Milhollin had the authority to clear up this matter once

6

and for all, and tell the credit community which is only

7

looking for direction in such matters, and will follow that

8

direction from a central authority -- which Your Honors found

9

in Milhollin was the Federal Reserve Board clearly, and its

10

Clearly,

power was to enforce, apply and interpret the Act and the

11

regulation.

That -- what the Board has referred to as a

12

deferral of final action, and not a withdrawal at all, came

13

only after this Court granted certiorari in this case.
And in light of the fact that the 172 prior offic­

14
15

ial staff interpretations of the Federal Reserve Board have

16

been adopted without any substantive change, as we indi­

17

cated in Appendix B to our reply brief, is a factor that the

18

Court ought to consider, because these things were not promul­

19

gated -

has argued, but rather as seriously well considered and

21

thoroughly thought-through determinations by the Federal

Reserve Board as to interpreting the Act that governs the

States .

Skidmore v. Swift decision, that even

interpretation is entitled to such persuasive weight as is

evidenced from such things as the thoroughness of its con­

sideration and the validity of its reasoning.

Petitioners submit --

to agencies which are not empowered to, in effect, Kind of

thing?

11

expressly authorized by Congress to interpret the Act --

12

Skidmore v. Swift dealt with an agency which was not

MR. KRAMER:

Yes, Your Honor, but the Federal

13

Reserve Board, of course, is empowered to interpret the Act,

14

just as the Securities and Exchange Commission is empowered

15

to interpret the Securities laws.

16

in 1975, the Court held that even though the -- in the Forman

17

case, the securities law of 1934 refers to any stock --

18

the Securities and Exchange Commission had the power to inter­

19

pret that to exclude stock in a cooperative housing project

20

as not being a security, even though the express words of

21

the language of the statute that the agency was empowered

22

to interpret did use the term any stock, the Respondents in

23

this case, make an argument to the effect that the strict

24

words of the statute should be followed in this case, or the

25

strict words of the regulation, which indeed are not in point

And this Court's opinion

13

1

as to this type of assignment of an interest in unearned

2

premiums, but the Respondent's literal interpretation cuts

3

the heart of the purpose and intent of the Act out of it,

4

does not look at the purpose of the Act, which is to permit

5

informed, comparison credit shopping as this Court held in

6

the Milhollin decision.

7

after having thoroughly considered, in proposing 173, the

8

27 decisions in the conflicting district and circuit court

9

cases on this matter, who had -- the Board had, at the time

And the Board's determination,

10

they proposed 173, the benefit of intensive Congressional

1 1

hearings on the simplification act, and its own ongoing

12

revision of Regulation Z before it proposed 173, so that

13

it is the position of the Petitioners given those factors

14

which support the validity of the reasoning of 173, and

15

the determination of the Federal Reserve Board particularly

16

backed against the fact that none of the prior official staff

17

interpretations of the Board which were proposed were

18

changed in any way before they

QUESTION:

became final.

Is it clear that if -- that there was

something on the back of this contract?
MR. KRAMER:

Well, it is clear, Your Honor, that

a contract was included with the 'appendix.
QUESTION:

There was a -- there was a disclosure

on the back?
MR. KRAMER:

There is no question, no question.
14

1

QUESTION:

And if that disclosure had been put

2

on the front, would that -- is it agreed that it would have

3

been adequate?

4

MR. KRAMER:

Well Your Honor, there is a problem

5

with respect to that, because the Courts

6

ing our Seventh Circuit, has held that there is a violation

7

of the Truth-in-Lending Act if you overdisclose and claim

8

a security interest where you do not have one.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I know.

have held, includ­

For example

But in this particular

10

case if the disclosure on the back had been put on the front

1 1

would the Seventh Circuit have come out the way it did?

12
13
14
15
16

MR. KRAMER:

I don't think the Seventh Circuit

would have come out the way it did, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I think --

It would have -- there would have been

no problem then, I suppose?
MR. KRAMER:

That's right.

The point of the Peti­

17

tioners is that the Seventh Circuit was wrong in its decision

18

And indeed, in reading its decision and in reading the

19

very reluctant, two concurring opinions, from Judges Cudahy

20

and Swygert, it is clear that the Seventh Circuit felt it

21

was being dragged along by what it was being required to do

22

in providing a very liberal and very technical construction

23

of the Truth-in-Lending Act.

24
25

QUESTION:

And I would point out to --

What's the source of -- what was the

source of the Seventh Circuit's decision that the disclosure
15

1

8
9

had to be on the front, rather than the back?
MR. KRAMER:

Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit more or

less looked at the Fifth Circuit's decision, and -QUESTION:

Well what did the Fifth Circuit rely on,

the statute or the regulation?
MR. KRAMER:

The Fifth Circuit relied on the phil­

osophy that if it was important enough to claim in the
contract it was important enough to put on the front.

And

that's the rationale of the Fifth Circuit's --

10

QUESTION:

Did

MR. KRAMER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. KRAMER:

they say it violated the statute?

And they said it violated the statute.
And, wholly aside from Regulation Z?
They said, the cases that have so

14

held have held that it's a violation of the statute and the

15

regulation.

16

that was on the back of the contract on the front of the

17

contract, Your Honor.

18

in 173., promote proper -- the purposes of the act or proper

19

20

QUESTION:

21

22

However, that rationale would put everything

It would not, as the Board has noted

Well what if -- what is your position

if it hadn't been disclosed at all?
MR. KRAMER:

If it hadn't been disclosed at all,

23

even on the back, Your Honor, then the Creditor would not have

24

that right to unearned physical damage insurance premiums.

25

It would not be --

part of the contract.
16

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. KRAMER:

Why -It would not then be part of the

3

contract if you couldn't claim it.

4

makes it part of the contract; the issue in this case is

5

whether it was required under the Truth-in-Lending Act to

6

be disclosed on the front as a security interest, along

7

with the vehicle which was the real

8

this transaction.

QUESTION:

10

MR. KRAMER:

QUESTION:

Putting it on the back

Mr. Kramer, just to be sure I'm right,
Yes, Your Honor.
-- it's this language, is it, that appeal

12

on the back: "buyer hereby assigns to seller any monies

13

payable under such insurance, by whomever obtained, including

14

returned or unearned premiums."

15

MR. KRAMER:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That's correct, Your Honor.
And did you answer my brother White

that if that had appeared on the front it would have -- it
w ould not have been adequate?

19

MR. KRAMER:

It would have satisfied the Seventh

20

Circuit, Your Honor, but I would point out two important

21

factors with respect to that.

22

is, in the Seventh Circuit's decision, it is obvious, and that

footnote states, "it may be critical to the credit industry

The first of which is, 173

If Your Honor looks at footnote 24, I believe it

17

that there is not an official staff interpretation of the

Federal Reserve Board on this question, but there is not."

But I still don't -- without regard to

1 1

what the Seventh Circuit might have held, what would be your

12

view whether had what I read you appeared on the front, would

13

that have satisfied any disclosure requirement -- do you

14

suggest?

15

MR. KRAMER:

Your Honor, it would not have

16

satisfied a requirement of the statute or the regulation,

17

because neither the regulation nor the statute require it,

18

and all that must be on the front is what is required of

19

it, and as I've indicated --

Yes, Mr. Justice?
The reason, if it has to appear on the

be disclosed on the front and if this is a security interest

19

that provision of the statute then requires its appearance

20

MR. KRAMER:

Exactly.

MR. KRAMER

The requirement, Your Honor, would

be with reference to disclosure statements under the Truth-

disclosure statement.

A disclosure statement may be given

as a separate document on -- and not as the front of a
contract -- but in this case, the front of the contract is
the disclosure statement.
QUESTION:

5

So if you said -- if you had just

6

provided that the entire contract should be the disclosure

MR. KRAMER:

That would not be permissible under

the provisions which require that the disclosure statement

be on one sheet of paper and I believe, on the front, ex­

1 1

clusively .
In conclusion, we have argued in our brief and

12
13

pointed out to the Court in our brief that the adoption

14

of the original Truth-in-Lending Act, the Act that this case

15

comes under, and its security interest provisions, came from

16

the floor of Congress with the idea of preventing not --

17

and not affecting the type of interest which is before the

18

Court now, but what was referred to on the floor of

19

Congress by Congressman Cahill and Senator Proxmire, as

20

a

21

of second mortgages on purchasers homes and borrowers homes,

22

unwittingly given by such borrowers -- that's what the

23

security interest provision of the Act was adopted -- to

at this time, there is no relationship whatsoever to what
Congress had in mind when it originally adopted the Act, un­

Volcker has said in the letter that is attached to our
reply brief as an appendix, that this issue disappears under
the new Act.

And it’s very clear that this disclosure

is not required under the new Act.

In conclusion, I would cite to the Court, --

Both, Your Honor.
Because your point is -- there's a

it's not -- the property is not significant, as I understand
it?

MR. KRAMER:

QUESTION:

12

But significant interest in property

That's right.

That's right.

That insurance is rather a sort of --

a fringe -MR. KRAMER:

13

That's correct.

As Judge Cudahy

14

said, and he was joined in by Judge Swygert in his concur­

15

ring opinion, that to require the disclosure of this par­

16

ticular assignment on the face of the contract would merely

17

add virtually inconsequential information; lengthening,

18

complicating and trivializing this disclosure for no apparent

19

reason.

20

QUESTION:

But you said earlier, I think you were

21

interrupted, that only five words would have to be added

22

to this phrase.

23

MR. KRAMER:

That's Respondent's contention, and

24

this Court rejected the contention in Milhollin with only

25

two words having to be added to that contract, because it
24

1

was not within the intent of Congress.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but just as a matter

3

of whether it's true or not, is it not true that by just

adding the words "and insurance policies", or something

like that, you would have an adequate disclosure?

MR. KRAMER:

It could be done, Your Honor.

the Act

The use of the broad language "any security

10

interest" reflects an unmistakable intention of Congress

11

that every security interest retained by a creditor in the

12

course of a credit transaction be disclosed.

13

in the cases of Shea v. Vialpando and Harrison v. PPG

14

Industries has indicated that the use of the term

15

precludes limited or narrowed statutory construction.

broad language in the statute, "any security interest",

would also controvert

This Court,

The

-- Ford Credit's suggestion, that

Well now, the Proposed Official Staff

20

Interpretation 173, which as I understand it has not yet

21

become effective, does say that this kind of interest need

22

not be -- need not appear on the face of the statement.

23

if it says that, doesn't it necessarily also say that it's

24

not a security interest, if the statute, as you tell us

25

unequivocally requires that any security interests do

And

appear?
MR. ALOP:

I would not dispute that, Your Honor.

The proposed FC-0173 does leave one with the implication

that it is not a security interest.

QUESTION:

Where does the relevant text to that

regulation appear?

MR. ALOP:

QUESTION:

And that's the source of the require­

20

21

MR. ALOP:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Now, what if in that regulation it had

Suppose that that regulation said that?
MR. ALOP:

Then we would not have this lawsuit

QUESTION:

Well why isn't that -- if 173 is

5

adopted, why isn't that in effect an amendment of -- it

6

just adds an exception to 228(a).

7

MR. ALOP:

The point is that

EC-0173 is an

8

unadopted, mere proposal of the Federal Reserve Board that

9

was issued with the caveat that it may be withdrawn or that

10

it may be altered after public comment was scrutinized.

1 1

Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has twice

12

in writing specifically precluded any reliance

13

and it has deferred any final action on FC-0173 as a result

14

of this Court's granting of certiorari in this case.

15

QUESTION:

on FC-0173

Do you concede that if the Federal

16

Reserve Board goes ahead and adopts the resolution, it will

17

be a valid regulation?

18

MR. ALOP:

If the Federal Reserve Board adopted

19

FC-0173 because it uses the test of incidentalness which is

20

at variance with the plain language of the Truth-in-Lending

21

Act and Regulation Z, and because it is also at variance

22

with longstanding Federal Reserve Board Regulations, or

23

rather, the interpretation in Public Information Letter

24

377, it would still be entitled to little deference under

25

the traditional test of Skidmore v. Swift S Co.

MR. ALOP:

I also said that it is at variance

with the language of the Act, which requires -QUESTION:

That was not hard to follow.

But do

11

you really place much reliance on the fact that the new

12

regulation is at variance with the old regulation?

13

MR. ALOP:

I place a reliance on the fact that

14

Regulation Z defines security interest to encompass any

15

interest in property which secures payment and that this

16

proposal uses the test of incidentalness which ignores the

17

concept in Regulation Z that any interest in property con­

18

stitutes a security interest.

QUESTION:

Well what if this proposal had been

promulgated right after passage of the Act?

the phrase "security interest".

immediately after passage of the Act, saying security

Had that been the case, I believe there

would have been a contradiction between the Regulation Z

Well, there would have been no Regula­

Given that hypothesis -- that Section

13

was final action, would control.

14

that is the security interest definition of

But given --

It would control, because the statute

MR. ALOP:

No, Your Honor.

3

to put some of them on the back, you wouldn't be

MR. ALOP:

That's correct.

I would note that

4

the Federal Reserve Board has issued a series of rulings

5

which have required disclosure of a wide range of security

6

interests, security interests which do not fit into Ford

7

Credit's characterization of essential security interests.

8

The Federal Reserve Board, in their rulings set out at page

9

9 of our brief, have required disclosure of security

10

interests in bank accounts, credit union accounts, and after

1 1

acquired property.

12

interest is essential, but whether -- but merely that any

security interest be required to be disclosed.

which secures payment or performance of an obligation and

thus:

17

every Court which has applied that test to the issue in this

case has concluded that a creditor's claim to returned

insurance premiums is a security interest under the Truth-

in-Lending Act.

21

The test is not whether the security

The Regula­

Although the first test, the first prong of the

22

in property it has retained in this case.

this is an incidental interest and therefore need not be

Ford Credit has not disputed.

6

QUESTION:

When you say term insurance premiums,

7

you're not talking about the life insurance premiums that

8

-- they were talking about in 1970, are you?
MR. ALOP:

9
10

insurance premiums, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Just what exactly is the property interest;

11
12

This case involves physical damage

you know, described in -MR. ALOP:

13

Well in this case, for example, it

14

involved the physical damage insurance premium that exceeded

15

$200.

17
18
19
20
21

Given a cancellation of that insurance upon the

t itled to that $215 by virtue of its clause.

And in this

case, it meant $215 to the consumer.
QUESTION:

And why would Ford -- why would the

insurance company have cancelled?
MR. ALOP:

What happens is, is on default of the

22

consumer the -- by virtue of the contractual assignment

23

clause, Ford Credit is entitled to -- upon default, the

24

insurance is cancelled because there's no longer any need

25

for the continuation of physical damage insurance since the
33

1

car has been repossessed, at that moment, Ford Credit is

2

entitled to all returned insurance premiums that would

3

exist at that time.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Alop, do you think the buyer

5

reasonably would have expected to get the premium in that

6

situation?
MR. ALOP:

7

Well, consumers will have no means of

8

having any opportunity to know that they are entitled to

9

these funds unless the matter is meaningfully disclosed to

10
11

12
13

them.
QUESTION:

Well they really would not be entitled

to the funds if they are in default on the loan, would they?
MR. ALOP:

They are entitled to -- without any

14

clause, of course, those funds would go directly to the

15

consumer, if Ford Credit --

Doesn't there have to be a copy to the

dealer or the finance company?

22

QUESTION:

I mean, how does the finance company

23

know that the car is being insured, that it's a contractual

24

obligation to get insurance?

The contract requires the consumer to

it fairly clear that whatever money comes back will be paid

10

this case, the consumer purchased the insurance from an

1 1

independent insurance company and ordinarily, the consumer

consumer, given default or given a cancellation of the insur­

But by virtue of Ford Credit's --

Even though he was in default on his

to go from the insurance company to the dealer, to Ford

buyer of the car realize that that's why he's carrying the

You really think there's a significant

potential for misleading the buyers in this situation?
MR. ALOP:

It's not so much as an intentional

misleading -QUESTION:

I don't mean intentional, potential

for, do you think the buyers are really apt to be misled in
this situation?
MR. ALOP:

The buyer is not given an opportunity --

QUESTION:

It seems rather unlikely to me.

MR. ALOP:

Under the contract in this case, the

buyer really is not given a meaningful opportunity to know
that this sum

of insurance --

QUESTION:

He's told he's got to buy insurance

to cover this risk and he assumes he can default on the loan,
and get the rebate on the premium and put it in his pocket,
is what you're saying?

23

MR. ALOP:

I'm saying that --

24

QUESTION:

It seems very unlikely to me.

25

MR. ALOP:

-- that the consumer does not know that
36

1

these refunds will be going to Ford Credit rather than to

2

be coming back to the consumer, absent the meaningful dis­

3

closure on the front side of the contract.

substantial funds by virtue of this security interest over

7

the last 10 years and this is an attractive --

8
9

QUESTION:

It's -- Ford Credit has recovered

But aren't those recoveries all against

a larger, unpaid debt that they weren't able to collect?

10

I mean, isn't that always when they get the money on these

11

refunds ?

12

MR. ALOP:

There are --

13

QUESTION:

They don't make any profit on it.

14

MR. ALOP:

There are occasionally surpluses, in

15

which the secured property, the automobile, for example,

16

will -- the value of that will exceed the outstanding debt.

17

QUESTION:

But then the buyer gets the surplus?

18

MR. ALOP:

The buyer is supposed to get that surplus,

19

the buyer will have no means of knowing that this money is

20

coming to the buyer unless it is disclosed.

21

QUESTION:

No, but isn't it a fact that the 100

22

million or whatever the big sum of money is that Ford has

23

collected is a reduction of losses

24

suffered?

25

MR. ALOP:

it

otherwise would have

that's correct.

MR. ALOP:
tue of that.

4
5

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

And also, it's also clear that the

buyers would never have had a legal right to retain any of
that -- or, I mean, any equitable right to any of that money,
because they would have been indebted to Ford for an amount

11

geater than the amount that's in dispute in every one of
12

these cases.
13

MR. ALOP:

Well, this money would, if there is no

14

deficiency, if there was a surplus, of course, it would go
15

directly to the consumer -- even, however, if this Court
16

deemed that the interest in this case to be incidental, it
17

would still be sufficient to meet the test of Regulation Z's
18

definition of security interest, which merely requires any
19

interest

in property.

20

The second prong of the Regulation Z test is an
21

interest in property which secures payment or performance of
22

an obligation.

The interest Ford Credit has retained in

23

returned insurance premiums secures payment of this obligatior
24

because Paragraph 17 of Ford Credit's contract specifically
25

authorizes Ford Credit to recover returned insurance
38

1

premiums and to apply them towards the outstanding debt.

2

Thus, Ford Credit's interest in this returned insurance

3

premium secures the payment of the obligation and both

4

prongs of the Regulation Z test for security interest are

5

met.
Contrary to the assertion of Ford Credit which

6
7

was made today, the interest it retains in secured premiums

8

would, if properly disclosed to consumers, be understood

9

by consumers -QUESTION:

10
1 1

Incidentally, Mr. Alop, may I ask how

much actually is involved here?

12

MR. ALOP:

The total amount of the premium,

in

13

this case was $215.

14

QUESTION:

Oh, and the return would be about what?

15

MR. ALOP:

The return would of course depend at

16

the time -- on the timing of the cancellation of the insur­

17

ance .

18

QUESTION:

Do we know here when it was?

19

MR. ALOP:

No we do not, Your Honor.

20

Ford Credit also has argued that --

21

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question as a matter

22

of history, is it true that before this statute was passed

23

it was customary for the finance companies to buy the insur­

24

ance themselves, and then they would buy the policy and make

25

the purchaser pay the premiums?
39

MR. ALOP:

1

2
3
4

Honor, but I believe it is customary for both mechanisms
to exist.

7

8
9
10

Dealers oftentimes do sell this insurance, in

other cases, consumer -QUESTION:

5

6

The record doesn't reflect that, Your

And there's the provision in the

contract here that permits the buyer to buy it elsewhere if
he wants to.

I mean, it used to be in the home mortgage

business that the real estate brokers would make the money on
the insurance.

I guess it's probably true in this industry

as well, although I don't know.

And so, is this just sort

11

of one of those things that grew out of the fact that the

12

buyer was given an option to buy his own insurance and

13

therefore, the security interest was created in that policy?

14

Whereas, if the older practice had been followed, the dealer

15

would have just owned the policy himself.
MR. ALOP:

16

Well, in both situations of course, the

17

dealer retains the security interest in returned insurance

18

premiums.

19

there would explain anything.

Under both.

I don't think the historical analysis

Ford Credit argued that this information would

20
21

create an information overload.

Certainly when the matter

22

is disclosed, as it is in the present contract, buried on

23

the reverse side and clothed in the language of an assign­

24

ment clause, in one sentence which is 58 words long, it is

25

confusing.

However, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
40

1

the Gennuso decision indicated that a creditor's security

2

interest in returned insurance premiums could be meaningfully

3

disclosed to consumers in a matter of a few words and also

4

importantly, intelligibly and meaningfully.

5

note that Ford Credit's new contract which it has adopted

6

subsequent to the decision below, does disclose this infor­

7

mation to consumers

8

QUESTION:

Well the decision below told it it had

10

MR. ALOP:

That's correct, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

That's no-- not very surprising.

12

MR. ALOP:

My point is however, that they have,

9

And we would

to ?

13

they are now disclosing this information concisely in a

14

matter of five words on the front side of the contract; that's

15

hardly creating an information overload that they refer to.

16

I would also note that Ford Credit's reliance on

17

the Truth-in-Lending Simplification and Reform Act is mis­

18

placed.

19

not retroactive, it is not made applicable to pending

20

litigation or is it applicable -- or made retroactively

21

applicable, thus.

22

is not relevant to this case and by virtue of

23

States Code Section 109, Ford Credit's liability for viola­

QUESTION:

Would it have a bearing on --

MR. ALOP:

It would, Your Honor, because I believe

it does change the law regarding the disclosure of security
interests.

There's no question of that.

The point is that

Ford Credit argues that we should look to the Simplification
42

Act because it allegedly interprets the Truth-in-Lending

2

Act, and we would note that there is nothing in the language

3

of the Simplification Act or the Committee Reports which

underlie the

transaction.

Credit has relied on is a statement, an isolated statement

of one senator -- Senator Garn, to the effect, arguing that

12

note, was not a member of the body that enacted the Truth-

13

in-Lending Act, the Congress that enacted the Truth-in-Lend­

14

ing Act, and Senator Garn's statement is not reflected in

15

the Committee Report; instead, it was inserted in the Con­

16

gressional Record after the Committee Report was issued and

17

it's not reflected in the Committee Report.

18

QUESTION:

And his statement was to the effect that

19

the new provisions of the Simplification Act were simply

20

clarifying?

21

MR. ALOP:

That's correct.

However this Court in

22

the past, has given little if any, weight to the post-passage

23

remarks of legislators regarding the meaning of previously

24

enacted legislation, particularly where the legislator was

25

not a member of the enacting body.
43

Ford Credit has argued that the application of

with regard -- except as with regard to the Respondents in

this case.

5

by conceding that the Respondent should recover, regardless

of the application of the decision as given, Ford Credit

7

has destroyed any adversarial relationship between the

8

parties on this issue.

Ford Credit on

the issue of non-retroactivity, presents no case or contro­

12

versy in that it seeks no relief that will affect the

13

Respondents in any way, it seeks no alteration in the judg­

14

ment below, and as a consequence, in essence it seeks an

15

advisory opinion that will affect other litigation, pending

16

litigation in which the Respondents have no interest.

17

QUESTION:

The Court announced a decision this

18

morning with which I am sure you haven't yet had time to

19

familiarize yourself -- Kirchberg v. Feenstra, which might

20

have some bearing on this aspect of the case.

21

22

MR. ALOP:

As it is our opinion that the Court

need not reach the issue of prospective application, we will

23

stand on our briefs with regard to the Chevron analysis.

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON J. KRAMER, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

8

MR. KRAMER:

The purpose of the clause that we've

been discussing today is not to gain access to incidental

9

unearned security interests, but rather to keep the

10

real security interests in these transactions not only for

1 1

Ford Credit but for the industry insured -- and that is,

12

to maintain insurance on the financed vehicles themselves

13

which are the real security interests in the transaction.

14

We do not only rely upon Senator Garn who is a member of

15

the committee that adopted the Simplification Act, but

16

also the Federal Reserve Board that held that the Simpli­

17

fication Act clarifies this issue as intended by the original

18

Act.

19

Finally, with respect to this matter, creditors

20

are only looking for clear direction from the Federal

21

Reserve Board which has stated that clear direction in 173,

22
23
24
25

and

but

for this Court's grant of certiorari that would

be the law today.

Respondent

should not be permitted

to embrace the Federal Reserve Board's decision while at the
same time ignoring 173.

Thank you.
