ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH E. RASCHKE, JR., ESQ.,

1 1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

13
14

MR. RASCHKE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The State of Minnesota is here today asking this

15

Court to review and reverse a decision of the Minnesota Supreme

16

Court which struck down supposedly on equal protection grounds

17

a Minnesota law which would have stopped the sale at retail in

18

Minnesota of milk in single-use throwaway bottles which are

19

made 100 percent from oil and natural gas resources.

20
21

22
23
24

25

In reality, however, this case deals with the ques­
tion of whether we should return to the days when the courts
under the banner of substantive due process interposed their
judgment upon the legislature in terms of determining the wis­
dom and expediency of given pieces of legislation and weighing
evidence and testimony pro and con to determine whether a
3

1

particular piece of legislation will best do the job set out

2

for it.
The statute in question was proposed by the Minnesota.

3
4

Pollution Control Agency and passed by the Legislature in the

5

spring of 1977 as an implementation of general State policy

6

and additionally as a reaction to a specific set of circum­

7

stances which were then existing within the State.
In general, the agency and the Legislature recognizee

8
9

the ridiculous waste of resources and energy, and particularly

10

fossil fuels, in many circumstances, as well as the unnecessary

11

disposal problems which had been created by the proliferation

12

of single-use packaging which serves no other purpose but con­

13
14

15
16

17

18

venience.

packaging, and the plastic jug here in issue is a prime example
of that type of a package; and encourage better alternatives
where they're available, in this case alternatives such as
returnable containers either in plastic or glass, which have a
long history in the milk industry.
QUESTION:

19

20

The legislative policy was to discourage such

Do you think the Minnesota Legislature is

about next time to ban paper containers?
MR. RASCHKE:

Do I personally feel they were, Your

21

Honor?
22

QUESTION:

Well, whether — was there legislation

23

introduced to that effect in the session in which this one was
24

passed?
25

4

1

MR. RASCHKE:

This bill originally was introduced

2

in the form of banning specifically the plastic jug in reaction

3

to a then-pending move by major dairies within the State to

4

commit a lot of money and capital expenditures in long-term

5

commitments to the throwaway plastic jug.
At one point in time there was an amendment proposed

6
7

that would have banned paper but it passed in the form origi­

8

nally introduced banning only the plastic jug.

9

idea was to wait and see what sort of effect this Act would

10

I think the

have had.
QUESTION:

1 1

Well, the milk industry and the pulpwood

12

industry in Minnesota both have clout, and -- I guess my ques­

13

tion is, how political this is, rather than how environmentally

14

protective ?
MR. RASCHKE:

15

Well, I don't think it was necessarily

16

at all political in the sense of reacting without legitimate

17

policy to specific pressure groups.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

I think it was clear from

the motives of the agencies that supported the bill as well as
many of the statements made in debate that the idea of the bill
was to stop a trend that the Legislature and the agency saw as
harmful.

And that was the situation in which we were commit­

ting ourselves to going down the road of throwaway containers
which would -- all parties, I think, here, concede that it was
not the best environmental alternative.
The specific situation that the Legislature was
5

1

reacting to, as I indicated in my prior answer, is that the

2

milk industry, major dairies within the State, were on the

3

verge of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in commit­

4

ment to long-term production of these plastic jugs, and the

5

machinery necessary to produce these plastic jugs is both ex­

6

pensive and has a long useful life.

this move to plastic would lock us into a situation which would

virtually eliminate any chance of movement to environmentally

14

preferable alternatives.

QUESTION:

Are the paper-type containers divided

into two categories, one readily destructible and the other
not so readily destructible?
MR. RASCHKE:

To my knowledge, Your Honor, there's

only one sort of paper container which was at issue.

We talk

primarily about the gallon-size container because the plastic
is only sold in gallon-size, and the data and the studies only
contained -- there was one sort of paper container.

The Act

was never permitted to take effect because this trial was com­
23

menced in the fall of 1977 before the 1978 effective date.
24

The '78 trial took on what can best be described as
25

6

1

the tone of the legislative hearing.

2

amounts of data, government reports, which were used -- the

3

same reports used by both sides in supporting their positions.

4

There were copious

Opinions, expert and non-expert alike , were offered

5

on the question of whether the plastic jug is the single worst

6

container from an environmental standpoint or merely the

7

second-worst container possible for the sale of milk.

8

tion and.ideas were offered concerning whether the milk indus­

9

try would or would not have a greater tendency to go to pre­

10

ferable containers with or without the plastic jug.

1 1

Did they all con­

During the last three years while this

case was in litigation, Your Honor?

17

19

And when

General Raschke, does the record tell us

13

15

Specula­

that at all.

Yes.
I don't believe the record reflects

I'm not aware of anything in the record which

makes reference.
QUESTION:

If

they have in fact all converted, as I

guess they've been permitted to do, then the reason for the
legislation would have passed, wouldn't it?

The idea was to

stop them from doing that.
MR. RASCHKE:

Well, I think the idea, Your Honor,
7

1

was to prevent the situation in which the industry was permit­

2

ted to go ahead and make these types of investments and then

3

later complain of the tremendous impact it would have on them

4

to then come back and ban either the plastic or the paper.
I don't think that has significance in viewing the

5

6

rational basis of the Legislature.

7

this sort could be defeated by the regulated industry running

8

out, making the commitments, and by defeating themselves in

9

attempting to defeat the legislative purpose.
QUESTION:

And the second question, this perhaps

duplicates what Mr. Justice Blackmun asked, but as I understand
it, part of the rationale was, you've to stop this because
we're going to get rid of all disposable containers and paper
containers would be next.

Has there been any activity to get

rid of the paper containers at all?

Is there anything on the

public record, subsequent to 1977?
MR. RASCHKE:

17
18

Otherwise any attempt of

There's nothing I'm aware of in the

public record, Your Honor.

I think what we're doing, or what

may be happening is that the Legislature in the State of
Minnesota as well as perhaps other places is waiting to see

20

the outcome of this case, and to see whether the Legislature
21

will indeed be permitted to proceed a step at a time.

A look

22

at the -23

QUESTION:

I don't see how the outcome, whichever

24

way the case is decided, if the goal really is to get rid of
25

these containers, I don't see any reason why they don't enact

2

the second statute.
MR. RASCHKE:

3

Well, I think the goal of the Legisla­

4

ture, Your Honor, is to proceed a step at a time beginning

5

with the least intrusive sort of regulation.

Now, this

Of course, the least offensive regulation

is to let the paper containers continue forever, I suppose.
MR. RASCHKE:

9

In -- well, in moving in the direction

10

of our goal, this statute has never been permitted to take

1 1

effect.

12

sort of effect that we hope for it.

We don't know whether it would have the salutary

I think that's a fair statement, Your

In other words, you can't take the next

But I don't understand why not.

If you

want to get rid of disposable containers, why don't you say,
no paper containers after five years, or whatever the time
would be?

I just don't understand it.
MR. RASCHKE:

That could be done, Your Honor.

My

point is that I don't believe that it is a point of constitu­
tional significance, but —

23

QUESTION:

Well, it would remove the constitutional

24

argument that your court relied on.
25

9

1

MR. RASCHKE:

2

QUESTION:

That's perhaps --

It would remove any constitutional ques­

3

tion and it would clearly accomplish your environmental goal.

4

The fact that you don't do it makes one wonder whether that's

5

really the purpose of the legislation.

6

MR. RASCHKE:

There are a number of other factors.

7

Both the parties here that have been selling milk in plastic

8

containers and other dairies, most other

9

of Minnesota, are selling milk in paper containers, either

dairies in the State

10

paper containers in addition to plastic or paper containers

1 1

themselves.

12

ture could well have chosen

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

And one of the rational reasons why the Legisla­
to

first

half plastic and hope

for some voluntary movement towards better containers is that
if you pick a point in time and ban both plastic and the paper
containers at the same time you've got almost every dairy in
Minnesota scrambling to convert.

And I think it's reasonable

for the Legislature to take the point of view that we'll stop
the plastic container, which is the single greatest competi­
tive enemy to better containers.
The record shows that at least in other states the

20

plastic throwaway jug has made its gains at the expense of
21

returnables.

One party, Wells Dairy from Iowa, purchased a

22

plant which was producing in pouch-type containers, which the
23

data shows are environmentally preferable, and discontinued
24

that in order to go to the plastic.
25

10

1

So, hopefully, if we remove the greatest single com­

2

petitive enemy to more environmentally sound containers, there

3

may be some voluntary movement in that area.

4

that's a judgment that the Legislature is entitled to make.

5

Certainly the option that you suggest and the option that was

6

suggested by the Minnesota Supreme Court would more quickly

7

accomplish the environmental goal, but I think that it's at

8

the expense of other things.

And I think

I think the past decisions of this Court in many

9

10

cases permits the Legislature to choose a step at a time

1 1

approach if it feels that that is called for in the given

12

situation.

13

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you for a minute?

14

MR. RASCHKE:

15

QUESTION:

You may.

You make the argument that the Minnesota

16

Supreme Court decided this case on substantive due process

17

analysis, and I would certainly agree there4s a good deal of

18

language in the opinion that I would construe that way.

19

20

21
22
23
24

And

yet I also read the opinion of the trial court saying positively
that the purpose of the statute, despite what the Legislature
said, was discriminatory.

Its purpose was to discriminate

against the plastic industry, not represented in Minnesota, but
outside of that State.

And the findings of fact of the trial

court were found by the Supreme Court on an independent review
of the evidence to be incorrect.

25

11

So what do we do with those

1

findings ?

2

MR.

RASCHKE:

I think there are a couple of problems,

3

many problems, with the findings of the District Court.

4

I think the problem with the District Court was that it clearly

5

said that it felt it was its job to review, weigh, and balance

6

the evidence, because the District Court saw itself as the

7

initial fact finder.

8

all, did not I believe adopt the finding that the Act had a

9

protectionist motive.

The Minnesota Supreme Court, first of

I think the Supreme Court, our Supreme

10

Court noted at A-35, I think it is, in the Appendix, that the

1 1

Act unquestionably deals with a proper public purpose, thus

12

rejecting the theory of the trial court.
But a problem that our Supreme Court shared with the

13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20

trial court is that they tended to agree that the trial court
was the basic fact finder rather than the Legislature.

our contention that based on Opinions of this Court, recently
reaffirmed in such cases as Exxon v. Governor of Maryland,
City of New Orleans v. Dukes, is that it is the legislative
judgment that must stand, so long as there's any rational
basis to support it.

Yes, Your Honor.

The third sentence:

1 1

relevant findings of fact by the trial court, supported by the

record, and upon our own independent review of documentary

21

sources, we believe the evidence conclusively demonstrates
that the discrimination against plastic nonrefillables..." and
then it goes on to pick up equal protection analysis which was
the analysis relied upon primarily by the courts below.

But

the Commerce Clause issue is the one that concerns me, and I
think that language by the Supreme Court can be read as con­
firming the finding of fact with respect to discrimination made
by the trial court, unless you have some explanation for it
that hasn't occurred to me at the moment.
MR. RASCHKE:

Well, our’Supreme Court did not reach

22

the Commerce Clause issue and I guess I read that particular

phrase as referring to what

Well, didn't the Supreme Court also say

that nonrefillable milk containers present solid waste prob­

returnable milk containers should be encouraged?

MR. RASCHKE:

QUESTION:

And then it

Yes, it did.

Isn't that inconsistent with the trial

1 1

I think it's directly inconsistent, and

I don't think by affirming, by saying that they were generally

affirming the trial court's standards that they were getting

14

to that point.

15

having said this, (a) was looking at its function as reviewing

16

the trial court's findings; and (b) undertook the task of

17

determining which of admittedly admissible evidence was more

18

or less credible than others, in making the ultimate conclu­

19

sions about which type of regulation would be best effective

20

and what the court felt was

21

clear that on a proper form of analysis that the Act must

22

stand.

25

the single worst container.

It's

First of all, there is data on the record that clear­

23
24

The important thing is that our court after

ly demonstrates the plastic jug is an environmentally poor
container.

Second, there's clear data on the record which
14

1

shows that it's the greatest waster of fossil fuel energy and

2

will take up the most space in landfills.

It's the greatest

3

competitive barrier to better containers.

We're on the verge

4

of a -- we're on the verge of long-term commitments to that.

5

If we add the competitive advantage together with these long­

6

term commitments and the incentive to produce and promote the

7

throwaway container that that would entail, we would virtually

8

guarantee no movement towards the goal of better containers.
The plaintiffs here, as we've been discussing pre­

9

10

viously, have sought to make the Commerce Clause -QUESTION:

11

I don't understand that last argument

12

guaranteeing it.

All they have to do is ban the other con­

13

tainer too, don't they?
MR. RASCHKE:

14

We could do that, Your Honor, and I

15

think that would be a legitimate legislative choice, but what

16

we're arguing here is that it is not a constitutionally man­

17

dated legislative choice.

18

for a number of years have clearly indicated that legislation

19

is not to be struck down because

21

22
23
24

25

Cases that this Court has .decided

it

proceeds one step at a

time, and goes not as far as it might go to better accomplish
the goal.
And City of New Orleans v. Dukes, was the latest case
of that type.
QUESTION:

The difference with the Dukes case is , it

was clear from that legislation that as time passed on the
15

1

people who were then in business would go out of business.

2

But there's nothing in this record to say that you're ever go­

3

ing to prohibit paper containers.

MR. RASCHKE:

QUESTION:

Well, I think in the legislative --

This is no one step at a time argument.

It's just one step, period, is what you're saying.

7

going to take one step with no desire to take the other step.
MR. RASCHKE:

to take the first step without being constitutionally required
to guarantee when that second step will occur.

Yes, it has.

And have you begun to take the second step

or not?

MR. RASCHKE:

fect to see how less restrictive, less onerous regulations

work before we're constitutionally required by court decree

6

QUESTION:

Well, so, has the result of this case

been that plastics are now being used?
MR. RASCHKE:

10

They are.

So the rationale has disappeared now for

11

saying that we started with plastics because they really hadn't

financial commitments, for one thing.

there are viable alternatives that can be used.

First, we wish to encourage efforts like that of Minnesota

20
21

22
23
24

25

The recent opinions of

this Court and several recent enactments of the Congress have
manifested the important national interest in conservation of
nonrenewable resources.

The Minnesota Supreme Court, however,

in our view took insufficient notice of this statutory purpose
and concluded that the use of oil and gas in plastic con­
tainers, plastic milk containers, was small and that in any
18

1

event plastic can be recycled.

2

give serious attention to the problem of depletion of non-re-

3

newable fuels.

4

Therefore there was no need to

The problem is that if you multiply the oil and gas

5

used in milk cartons in Minnesota across 50 states, a cross­

6

patching not only for milk but for other beverages and food­

7

stuffs and over time, then the problem may indeed be substan­

8

tial .
As for the question of the recycling of plastic,

9

10

there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the plastic

1 1

container in Minnesota or anywhere else, in fact, is recycled

12

or that recycling is feasible. The Legislature certainly could

13

have concluded to the contrary, and in any event, even if

14

recycling of plastic was a way of reducing the dependence on

15
16
17

non-renewable fuels, the Legislature was free as a matter of
constitutional choice to select another alternative for dealing
with the problem of solid waste disposal and energy misuse.
The second Government interest, federal governmental

18
19

20

21
22

interest in this case, is in solid waste disposal generally
and more particularly in beverage container disposal.

There

are a series of federal statutes that bear upon this question,
most particularly the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
1976.

A

federal interagency commission convened pursuant to

23

that statute addressed the question of beverage containers,
24

beverage container disposal, contemplated
25

19

whether or not to

1

pass a national statute and decided instead to look to the

2

states and see what the states' experience would be in various

3

methods directed to beverage container disposal.

4

Now, that proposal was directed to beer and soft

5

drink containers but the same notion of using the states as a

6

laboratory applies with equal force to milk containers.

7

not only is it in the Federal Government’s interest to use the

8

states' experimentations in this area as a laboratory, it's in

9

the interest of each of the individual states including

Indeed

10

Minnesota to take a step and look empirically at their exper­

1 1

ience and then take the next step.
The experience of Vermont in this respect, we find,

12
13

very instructive, and that’s detailed in Footnote 6 of our

14

brief.

Mr. Dalton, can I ask you, on this ques­

tion of federal interest, if there is a choice presented in

17

any commerce situation between using plastic containers and

18

paper containers for dairy; products, are you saying that

19

there's a federal interest in choosing paper over plastic?

20

21
22
23

MR. DALTON:

No, I'm saying there's a federal interest

in leaving Minnesota free to choose paper over plastic, and
then in seeing whether that in fact does advance the statutory
goals of the -QUESTION:

to whether paper or plastic is used, or does it have a

MR. DALTON:

very clear preference for returnable bottles.
QUESTION:

I understand that but if there's a choice

between two disposables, one paper and one plastic, does the

and presumably you've made the factual determination that makes
one preferable to the other.
MR. DALTON:

What I'm saying is that, assume that in

other respects they are environmentally equally destructive or
harmful or nondestructive, that the Federal Government's pre­
ference for conserving fossil fuels would make plastic pre­
ferable over paper.

We have not made an independent judgment

of whether in fact plastic as opposed to paper is more

environmentally disruptive.

2

Legislature has made that judgment --

QUESTION:

The State of Minnesota's

I understand, but I'm curious about the

4

federal interest in this particular issue, and is there a

this or not.

I'm not quite clear on whether you've answered

8

MR. DALTON:

QUESTION:
MR. DALTON:

10

Okay.
Seems to me it's a yes or no question.
Well, in that case the answer must be,

1 1

yes, given the federal interest in conservation of fossil

12

fuels.
QUESTION:

13

Would you have the same interest if a

14

neighboring state said, we will allow plastic but not paper,

15

because we think that's environmentally superior?

16

also say that choice should be defended in the same rationale?
MR. DALTON:

17

Would you

Yes, we would have an interest in that

18

statute because we have an interest in seeing whether that

19

process is an appropriate one or a successful one in leading

20

toward the ultimate goal of returnable containers.

21

words, we think that that would also withstand a rational scru­

22

tiny test, which is the only one to be applied in this case.

Because we talk

about nonrenewable resources being used here to make plastic.
Plastic can be made out of anything with carbon and hydrogen.
It can be made out of air, made out of grass.

As of now

petrochemicals are being used because they used to be burned
off, not flared off.

They never -- the plastic which goes

into the polyethylene is not a component of the heating fuel
which the State seems to indicate we're being deprived of in

used in this country for petrochemicals.

Mr. Keyes, isn't there some evidence in

tic, they will go back to glass instead of the paper, because
the paper gallon container, as opposed to the quart or

half-gallon, is pretty unsatisfactory?

MR. KEYES:

If there was, Mr. Justice Stevens, I

was conflicting evidence on many points in this case, and the

court did make a determination on what it considered to be the

great preponderance of the evidence.
