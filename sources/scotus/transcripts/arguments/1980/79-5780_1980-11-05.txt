Mr. MacDonald, you may

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme

12

Court of Florida brings an ex post facto question before the

Court, challenging the application to this petitioner of a

Florida statute reducing the statutory gain time formula avail­

Although not a class

A statement of the rather brief facts delineates the
issue which is involved in this case.

In 1976 Weaver, follow­

ing a negotiated plea bargain, was sentenced to 15 years in the
penitentiary.

Florida law at that time prescribed a gain time

formula which was mandated upon good conduct.

13

This is done under both statutes.
In 1978 Florida reduced the formula, the former for­

Thus the burden of the two years.

Upon petition by several pro se petitioners acting
separately to the Supreme Court of Florida, the ruling was had
which is now the subject of the petition before this Court.
Acting pro se, without oral argument, and I must
say, in candor, without discussion of the controlling authori­
ties enunciated by this Court
4

in the past, the Supreme Court

1

of Florida held in effect that this Act of the Florida Legis­

2

lature was an act of legislative grace which of course is a

3

monumental begging of the question.
The establishment of the system in the first instance

4

5

is the act of grace.

6

is not an act of grace, and that was the issue not discussed.

7

That doctrine, of course, has been discredited in virtually

8

every state in which this issue has arisen, and in comparable

9

situations it has been discredited, we feel, by the decisions

10

of this Court.

Once the state adopts an early release proce­

MR. MacDONALD:

15
16
17

18

20
21

22

Not for those who are already in the

system, Your Honor, because that brings me immediately,
Mr. Chief Justice, to the classic definitions which the Court
has given to an ex post facto loss, it's the Calder case in 1798 ,
in which we speak of the critical time is the time of the
commission of the offense.

Calder limits it to criminal cases

and a perhaps small area of penalties or forfeitures.

Beyond

that the effective time is the date of the commission of the
crime.

Thereafter, under Calder, adoption of a legislative

act which would allow a greater penalty is an ex post facto
23
24

law.
In 1883, for example, in Kring, the Court expressed

25

5

1

it slightly differently, stating that with relation to the

2

consequences of the offense, that which alters the situation

3

of the defendant or prisoner to his disadvantage , is a forbid­

4

den ex post facto law.

5

things of that type, because we are confronted here with gain

6

time, which the state again concedes, pages 5 and 6 of its

7

brief, gain time has the effect of determining the time of

8

confinement.

9

of liberty, and the extension of it, or the diminution of it

19

We do not need to go to parole, pardon,

And of course, confinement being the antithesis

obviously affects the penalty.
QUESTION: Your case really comes down to the propo­
sition that you expressed when you said, the state which had a
parole system could not abolish it with respect to prisoners
already convicted while that parole system was on the books.
MR. MacDONALD:

That was our opinion, although of

course you would not reach that issue in this case.

You're

only dealing with the gain time, but I would feel that that
would follow.
QUESTION:

How do you distinguish?

MR. MacDONALD:

There are some differences between

20

parole, obviously it being a much more subjective matter.. .
21

We have, for example, outlined in our brief the various types
22

of early release provisions which Florida does have and then
23

contrast it with the so-called statutory gain time, the time
24

off for good behavior with which we are concerned here,

and so-called

QUESTION:

What if Florida after the commission of

3

the offense but previous to the trial expanded the type of

4

information that could be used by the trial judge in sentencing

5

the defendant, if he were convicted.

6

would be admissible under the new system but not under the old

7

system.

Would that be a violation , 'of

ex post facto?

There are cases on that, Your Honor.

The questidn would be whether that ultimately amounted to a

10

procedural change or it would bring us to the fourth classi­

1 1

fication which is set out in Calder, that which changes the

12

testimony, or the nature of the testimony, to the point where

13

it would on the one hand . insure a' conviction and without it,

14

on the other hand, there would be no conviction.

15

would have the fourth category in Calder. 1

Then one

or

So I would think the conflicting arguments to be

16
17

advanced on the one hand from your procedural change, which is

18

not ex post facto; on the other hand, a change of such signifi­

19

cance that it falls within the fourth category of Calder.

MR. MacDONALD:

It might very well be under the

fourth definition of Calder, although there are some interest­

4

ing cases which we did not brief because I sought only to brief

5

those decisions of the Court which related to punishment.

6

This is the third category enunciated by Mr. Justice Chase.

7

There are, I would suggest to you, if it was clear that the ad­

8

mission of this evidence -- for example, the changing of the

9

nature of the testimony, which I believe is the phrase in

10

Calder -- for example, you'll find that quoted,

1 1

Justice, on page 20 of our brief: "Every law that alters the

12

legal rules of evidence and receives less or different testi­

13

mony than the law required at the time of the commission of the

14

offense."
We need not go that far in this case.

15

17

22

Mr.

Chief

We contend

the case is almost squarely within Lindsey v. Washington,
a 1937 case, in which the Court held that that which had been
formerly a permissive sentence now made mandatory subsequent
to the commission of the crime was a forbidden ex post facto
law;

followed by the per curiam affirmance of the three-judge

district court in Massachusetts in 1968 in Greenfield, which
held that there, subsequent to the crime, Massachusetts adopted
a statute which precluded parole violators from earning gain

23

time for the first six months after reincarceration, that also
24

being held a prohibited ex post facto law.

speak in terms of the date of the offense.

MR. MacDONALD:

before and then he was tried afterwards, I couldn't see there'd
be any unfairness.
MR. MacDONALD:

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, I could
The distinction need not be made in

this case because the extending amendment comes not merely
after sentencing, but after approximtely 2-1/2 years of acqui­

QUESTION:

then, because there in the new statute it was provided for a
minimum of 25 years, which the
MR. MacDONALD:

QUESTION:

9

10

13
14

MR. MacDONALD:

from the denial of the gain time for the lack of good conduct,
which is an entirely different matter.

Yes, sir, because as a matter of

21

mathematics, he was in the ten-day-a-month category at the
22

time the statute went into effect.

He is now in the six^

MR. MacDONALD:

QUESTION:

That's this case.

That's one ground for your case?

What about if you take it from the time

of the offense, the promise, as we're calling legislative

10

enactments here, in Dobbert was that you were going to serve a

1 1

minimum of 25 years regardless under the new statute?
MR. MacDONALD:

12

Yes, but the Court said, Mr. Justice

13

Rehnquist, that if in fact Petitioner Dobbert had not been

14

condemned to death but had been sentenced to the life imprison­

15
16
17

20

23

ment and had to serve the 25 years, my recollection is the
court said, there would be a very serious ex post facto ques­
tion.

And I believe under the decided precedents — in fadt,

I would say that would be governed almost completely by Lindsey
v. Washington, which you distinguished in your opinion.
Remembering also that in that case Dobbert made
what I would regard as virtually a sophistry that he wasn't
governed by either statute because there wasn't a valid capital
offense statute in effect in Florida at that time.
It is argued by the State that, there; is no liberty interest

We mention such cases as Greenfield and Wolff v.

6

McDonnell in our brief to point out that the Court has held

7

in the past that gain time once acquired is a liberty interest,

8

and once you lose earned gain time for disciplinary reasons,

9

it must be done with certain minimal procedural due process.

10

My point in citing those cases is not to suggest this is a

1 1

Fourteenth Amendment case at all, but merely to point out that

12

by definition the right to acquire a liberty interest neces­

13

sarily affects liberty in the first instance, thus affects

14

punishment, and thus is within those cases which we cite under

15

the ex post facto clause.

I think Lindsey is

in point in our situation, if the Court please.
QUESTION:

And tell me why.

MR. MacDONALD:

All right.

It was a Washington

QUESTION:

Well, what was the authorized penalty at

the time of the crime in Lindsey?
MR. MacDONALD:

I recall it was 15 years.

It was

4

within the sentencing range of the judge; subsequent to the

5

commission of the offense it was made mandatory.

6

if I'm wrong about the number but the point is that what was

7

formerly the outer limit of his discretion became a minimum.

QUESTION:

MR. MacDONALD:

So what was he sentenced to, though?

10

QUESTION:

1 1

MR. MacDONALD:

12

QUESTION:

My recollection -- I do not recall --

Wasn't he sentenced to 15 years?
Yes, he was.

And the Court --

Now, here's a law that says, at the time

13

of the crime you can be punished up to 15 years.

MR. MacDONALD:

QUESTION:

Forgive me

He is sen­

Yes, sir.

Then, the law is changed to 15 years?

Said! 15 years mandatory?
MR. MacDONALD:

But the Court said that it need not

inquire whether technically that was an increase in punishment

20

because it violated the statute; that he had the right to go

21

before the judge and receive consideration by a trial judge

22
23
24

25

who was not obliged to sentence him ten to 15 years, but he
might very well, under the former statute.

concept than the one my client -16

simply not the case, and that the only change in the law is the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALLACE E. ALLBRITTON, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ALLBRITTON:

1 1

12

That's

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

13

As I understand the issue urged upon this Court, it

14

is that the application of Florida's new gain time statute in

15

the computation of gain time makes the statute an ex post facte

16

law as applied to petitioner.
This same issue was rejected by the Florida Supreme

17

18

Court.

19

claim is that Section 944.275 permits the accumulation of a

20
21

22
23
24

25

As I understand it, the basis for the ex post facto

lesser amount of gain time than did the old statute, Section
944.27.
The Respondent contends that Florida's new gain time
statute is not ex post facto, because it does not apply a new
punitive measure to a crime already consummated to the detri­
ment or material disadvantage of the wrongdoer.
18

And I submit

1

to the Court that this is a necessary ingredient in order to

2

support an ex post facto claim, and'this Court so held, I be­

3

lieve, in Dobbert v. Florida.

4

The statute is remedial and constitutes a procedural

5

change in the statutory mechanism designed for the purpose of

6

granting gain time to deserving prisoners.

7

deprives petitioner of nothing that he has already earned,

8

and at this point let me urge upon the Court that I believe it

9

should be pointed out that under this Court's holding in

The statute

10

Beazell v. Ohio, that the prohibition against ex post facto

1 1

laws does not limit the legislative control of remedies and

modes of procedure.

MR. ALLBRITTON:

No, sir, I do not.

I want to point

out that although the new gain time statute does reduce the

10

fixed amount of calendar statutory gain time from the fixed

1 1

formula of 5, 10, and 15, to 3, 6, and 9.

statute provides greater opportunity to accumulate a greater

amount of gain time than did the old statute.

So you're deprived of the right to earn

good time credits for six months?

MR. ALLBRITTON:

That's fine if you look at his reply brief, because that's all
he wants the Court to view is the reduction in the 5‘, 10',-‘15.
QUESTION:
MR.

that the man has a right to earn a greater amount of gain time

MR. ALLBRITTON:

It may be in theory, but as a matter

of fact, I'm afraid it would be not.

Hopefully that it would,

that I could prevail on an argument that the gain time is a
matter of legislative grace, that the man didn't have any right
whatsoever to assume that this gain time statute in effect at
the time he was sentenced, was going to stay in effect and
not be changed.
QUESTION:

Well, in essence, isn't your argument that
29

1

all that lies ahead after the change in the statute was an

2

expectation on which he may not rely?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

3

That's all he has in support of

to have been placed in a materially more disadvantaged position
than he was prior to the passage of the new statute, if the
Court please.
QUESTION:

Can I just ask you one of the -- an

admittedly extreme example so that I at least understand what
your argument or charge is.
Supposing he is sentenced to 15 years and the
Legislature has not provided any gain time at all, and he is
on the last day of his 15th year and the Legislature changes
the sentence of his crime to 20 years.

25

30

And he goes to pick

1

up his stuff at the warden's office and the warden says, sorry,

2

you're going to have to serve an extra five years because

3

the Legislature just changed the statute.

violation of the ex post facto clause?

Would that be a

It would indeed.
QUESTION:

Let's modify that just to this -- suppos­

8

ing the statute said, your sentence shall be from one to 15

9

years and the warden, depending on how you behave in prison,

10

shall decide when you get out, within that range.

1 1

after he starts to serve, with no definite promise of when

12

he'll get out, a new statute is passed saying everybody in

13

that category must serve the full 15 years.

15
16

19

20

21
22

25

Would that violate

He wouldn't have had any right to

get out when the statute was passed.

It would be just like

this case, wouldn't it?
MR. ALLBRITTON:

17
18

And then

I think it would; I think it would,

yes .
QUESTION:

It would be like this case?

MR. ALLBRITTON:

It would, because that we're dealing

with something that is taking place at sentencing.

That is,

the new law that you assume to be passed will have made the
imposition of the 15-year sentence mandatory, and that would
be harsher.

I think that that would be ex post facto.

QUESTION:

Let me just change it a little bit.

31

1

Instead of saying, serve 15 years, he gets out when the warden

2

1

parole him within the-15-year period, and then

later on you pass a statute saying, we don't have any more

case, at all, I really don't. You - can guess this way,or that way,

7

but it's hard to say.

I can't even predict what this Court is

going do in the case.

I'd like to point out one thing in the

new statute, and this, I think, is new in penology.

Before you do, Mr. MacDonald, apparently

1 1

there was another change, if I'm not mistaken, between the two

12

laws.

13

given right at the beginning and the provisional time of re­

14

lease was set right at the beginning.

15

contemporary law, the credit is given only when it accrues, is

16

that right?
MR. MacDONALD:

One is that at least administratively the credit was

that.

And then, under the

Your Honor, here's the situation on

Actually, there's still a third statute, and I don't

want to confuse things, but the ultimate effect of it was
that under the new law they add the word monthly in the early
portion of the statute.

But if you will read Subsection 1(c)

at the end of the 15-day provision into the 9-day provision,
you will see that the gain time is credited each month.

..Under

both statutes the State still calculates the tentative date
because in the Supreme Court of Florida under the new law --

HR. MacDONALD:

Yes, sir. They gave --

So in other words you make no point of

that?
5

MR. MacDONALD:

No sir --

6

QUESTION:

All right.

7

MR. MacDONALD:

-- because there's no change.

8

QUESTION:

That was my only question.

9

MR.

MacDONALD: No, sir.

Let me go very quickly.

10

Need it be a part of the sentence?

I suppose that is tied to

1 1

the word "annexed" in the third category in Calder.

First,

12

let me say, Mr. Justice Chase adds at the end, "or similar
13

laws."

I know of no case that says they must be physically

14

tied the one to the other, that the judge must breathe the
15

words, you're sentenced to so many years subject to all of
16

the laws of Florida.

If one so desires, I have cited in my

17

reply brief, the fact that indeed Florida biennially and
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

before this time, reenacts in its entirety all of its criminal
statutes — all of its statutes, indeed.

So they are enacted

at the same time.
Finally, I think the Court disposed of that point
in the Lindsey case which we discussed earlier, because
it said we need not go to the question of whether this is tech­
nically a change in the punishment annexed.

And let me finally

say that if that is the law of Florida, then Florida can change
35

11

all of its sentences, because Your Honors can look at the

2

Florida statutes and see that it merely provides that murder

3

is a certain type of felony, burglary is a certain type of

4

felony, and all of the punishments are somewhere else.

MR. MacDONALD:

Yes, sir.

Now, I found that in that

manner.

if you read the district court opinion by Circuit Judge

Do you think there are cases

Like what?

I think Lindsey does, and I think

then one must go back to the more generalized pronouncements
which take us back to Kring, Cummings, and all the way,back to
Calder, as to the nature of punishment.

But I think Lindsey

and Scafati are the closest and finally, as I say, virtually
every state court which has passed upon this has held in our
direction.

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
