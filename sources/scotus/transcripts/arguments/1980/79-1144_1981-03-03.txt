ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN R. SLATER, JR., ESQ.,

8

10

We'll hear arguments

MR. SLATER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before the Court in this matter this

12

morning is whether a defendant in a federal antitrust action

13

may seek contributions, and the threshold question we submit

14

to the Court is whether the remedy sought here is one that is

15

necessary to achieve the congressional Intent of the anti­

16

trust laws?

17

contributions ?

18

Will it further the congressional goals to grant

In order to address the question, we would briefly

19

like to just review the very brief facts of this case.

20

are dealing here with a situation in which a plaintiff has

21

filed a treble damage action under Section 1 of the Sherman

22

Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act, alleging a pricefixing

23

conspiracy.

24

tified as alleged

25

the three respondents.

The plaintiff has sued Texas Industries.

We

Iden­

coconspirators with Texas Industries were
The plaintiff did not sue the three
3

1

respondents, he selected Texas Industries as the target and

2

Texas Industries in turn filed a third party demand seeking

3

contribution.

4

Now, although, in order for liability to exist to

5

the plaintiff here, there must have been some participation

6

by one or more of these respondents along with Texas Indus­

7

tries, the plaintiff can do what he has done here.

8

select and he can elect, as he has done, to sue a single

9

tortfeasor.

He can

Under the existing case law all coconspirators

10

are joint tortfeasors and have been so for many, many years.

1 1

Each, as a joint tortfeasor, is liable for the whole of the

12

damages that the plaintiff can prove.

13

if the plaintiff here had elected to sue all four and had

14

obtained a judgment against all four, he could then elect to

15

levy his judgment on any one of the four and collect from

16

that one.

17

And in addition, even

In the absence of contribution, TXI, Texas Indus­

18

tries, cannot force any of these respondents to share the

19

common burden, and had the plaintiff sued all four and obtain­

20

ed a judgment and decided to levy on one, that one in the

21

absence of contribution could not force the other judgment

22

debtors to pay any share of their judgment.

23

QUESTION:

You don't contend, do you, that if the

24

plaintiff had sued four and obtained a judgment against four,

25

he could have levied on one for the entire amount?

SLATER:

SLATER:

Yes, sir, I do.

I certainly do.

You agree that he could have done that?
Yes, sir, he could have done that.
And the contribution remedy would have tc

be worked out afterwards?
MR.

SLATER:

Well, in the absence of contribution

7

there would be no way that that one who is levied on could

8

force the other three to pay part of the deficit.

9

QUESTION:

Well, supposing there were a contributior

10

remedy, would you say that that prevented the plaintiff from

1 1

levying on one of the four?

12

MR.

SLATER:

No, sir; it would not prevent him.

does not affect the plaintiff's right to go

15

QUESTION:

16

MR.

SLATER:

For the full amount?
For the full amount.

The only thing

17

that contribution would do would be to permit the one who is

18

levied upon to get a share of that back from the others.

19

would not affect the plaintiff.

20

QUESTION:

Mr.

It

Slater, one of the amicus briefs

21

makes the point that I found quite an intriguing point, that

22

while you present this case as whether there is or is not a

23

right, or should be or should not be, and you say there shoulc

24

be,and is -- a right of contribution in antitrust suits among

25

joint tortfeasors, the point made by the amicus brief is
5

1

that this question can arise in a variety of ways and maybe

2

there's no single correct answer in every context.

3

you've already given us a context that this case does not

4

involve.

He sued only one.

from the unsued coconspirators.

8

made, and talking about the execution of those judgments.

This person did not sue four people, this plaintiff.

Then,

9

Now,

And in this case you claim contribution
You have just given us an

there's a lot of talk in these amicus briefs

10

about carving and contribution as against settling, codefen­

1 1

dants and so on, which also are not involved in this case,

12

and to which the answer might be different.

13

it's a single question, or do you think that it's many

14

questions, and that the answer may be different according to

15

the question in each separate context?
MR. SLATER:

16

Do you think

Your Honor, I view contribution as a

17

remedy that will further the’ goals sought hy the'antitrust lav s

18

and I think it is a remedy that should be recognized as such,

19

and that even though it might arise in a variety of contexts,

20

such as a settlement, for example, that can be handled.

And there'd be talk of it, we're here

about to bargain now -- then,, about — and so on.

Yes, sir, that's correct.

But our position, I

That's one of the purposes of a settle-

ment.
MR. SLATER:

7

Certainly.

And that the plaintiff’s

8

claiming should be reduced in some way, some way that can be

9

fashioned by the Court.
QUESTION:

10

Well, it's always reduced by the amount

11

of the settlement, by the amount of the money the plaintiff

12

gets .
MR. SLATER:

13

Yes.

That's right.

And there are

14

several ways that that can be done, depending upon how the

15

That's done Under' the present law, isn't

it?
MR. SLATER:

Yes, sir, that's correct.

It's reducec

by the amount of the actual payment.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SLATER:

Right.
Some of the questions that have been

22

raised are whether, for example, if a pro rata approach was

23

taken to contributions, such as was done in the Professional

24

Beauty Supply case, it may well be that the way to handle

25

settlements is to count the number of conspirators, and if a
7

1

plaintiff settles with one of the ten, let's say, then his

2

claim is reduced by ten percent.

Mr. Slater, do we know why the plaintiff

I think it was purely fortuitous,

Your Honor.

tomers that are involved in concrete, the purchasers of con­

the Court, had we all been sued and four of us been sued,

15

and this plaintiff wanted to do business with the three

respondents and decided to forego any business relations with

Texas Industries, he’d simply levy

18

tries and that would be as far as they could go.

19

QUESTION:

against

Tekas

Indus­

Or he might settle with each of them

20

for $1,000 apiece, so if I understand your view, then you’d

21

lose your right of contribution that you claim you have.

22
23
24
25

MR. SLATER:

But his claim would be reduced, though,

under my theory.
QUESTION:

But his claim wouldn't be reduced by any

thing here because he didn't buy anything from you.
9

MR. SLATER:

1

No, sir.

What I would suggest in that

2

case would be that, and as Justice Stewart points out, we're

3

getting into some areas where there are a lot of answers and

4

a lot of questions; but the pro rata approach, as taken by

5

the Court would be -- in our situation, for example, had the

6

plaintiff,

7

would have been reduced by 75 percent.
Now, before he settled with the three of those

four, he would give some serious thought, if he knew that, anc

10

Assuming

he

knew the law.

Then, before he would settle

11

for $1,000, he would think very hard, because he would be

12

giving up a substantial part of his claim.
On the other hand, he would know what he was giving

13
14

up.

If it turned out that there were more coconspirators

15

than four, then the amount he's given up would simply be

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Do the Individual defendants count as

coconspirators for the purpose of your rule?
MR. SLATER:

19

No, sir, we would not count them.

20

If there was a company and an employee, I think that should

21

be handled as one.

22

to be two.

23

QUESTION:

You would not distinguish and cause that

And couldn't -- if three people settled

24

for less than the claim, couldn't the plaintiff just tailor

25

the

cloth

to

meet the situation by increasing the ad damnum

in his complaint?

10

MR. SLATER:

1

Well, he could increase the ad damnum,

2

Your Honor, but the question, T think, would arise as to what

3

the judgment was when he finally got it.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SLATERr

Well, you never know that in advance.
No, you don't, but you should have

6

some idea in most of these cases of generally what damages

7

are going in.

8

there's been an overcharge in a pricefixing case of $10 a

9

yard, when in fact it's gone up $2. But the parties who were

And certainly sometimes they'll claim that

10

actually Involved in that sort of thing should have some

11

idea as to what the evidence will show, and be able to handle

12

what they feel are the damages.
If Your Honors please, the ultimate effect of a

13
14

no contribution rule is that the coconspirators whose joint

15

illegal activities create the liability may escape that lia­

16

bility

17

really is the end line of a rule against contribution.

and

go scot free at the whim of a plaintiff.

QUESTION:

18

You

do

That

agree . that the rule against

19

contribution among joint tortfeasors is fairly well estab­

20

lished in tort.law, do you not?

21

MR. SLATER:

Your Honor, the rule in favor of con­

22

tribution has been evolving consistently through the courts

23

in the last several years in the -- there's a case that we've

24

cited in the brief, the' Ko.hb case, which involved a mid-air

25

collision.

I think it's around 1970 or thereabouts.
11

The doctrine has evolved in the civil rights area

1

2

in the Glus case, just very recently.
QUESTION:

3
4

in tort law?

5

Or is it?

7

Your Honor, I don't have the answer

to that.
QUESTION:

8
9

Isn't the restatement ruled a contribution?

MR. SLATER:

6

Well, what about the nonstatutory cases

This trend you speak of, Mr. Slater,

to whatever extent there is a trend, that cuts against the

10

ancient equity doctrine in pari delicto the condition of the

11

defendant is the better, is it not?

12

13
14

MR. SLATER:

Well, Your Honor, It gets into the

question of, I think, of fairness.
QUESTION:

The old equity.

What is fair?
Whether it's relevant

15

here or not.

16

in equal fault, the courts, the law leaves them where it

17

found them, that's the general thrust, isn't it?

18

Perhaps relief would fall short, but if they're

MR. SLATER:

Well, I think that probably is true,

19

although I've read Perma Life a number of times, and I must

20

confess I really don't thoroughly understand the decision.

21

And as I say, I think that you have to consider the question

22

of fairness, whether it's among joint wrongdoers or whether

23

it's among nonwrongdoers.

24

fair and that's -- the evolution of this doctrine of

25

permitting

contribution

And it's a question of what is

has

evolved
12

along that line.

1

2
3

This Court, for example, in the Cooper Stevedoring
case, the admiralty case, I think talks in terms of -QUESTION:

Well, admiralty is a very, very special

4

sort of set of rules, isn't it?

5

MR. SLATER:

Yes, sir, it is sort of different

6

than the ordinary situation.

7

Glus case in the civil rights area; it's a 1980 case.

8

in the securities area we've had the recent Heizer Corporatior

9

case, and before that there were several cases.

10

QUESTION:

But you have the -- we have the
And

Well, in the securities area the federal

11

statutes themselves provide for contribution, do they not?

12

Many of them?

13

MR. SLATER:

Some of them do; yes, sir.

The

14

10(b)(5) cases, there the court implied a right of action,

15

cause of action.

21

QUESTION:

Of course the right of action is an

implied -- ?
MR. SLATER:

That's correct, under 10(b)(5).

But you're correct that there is, in the statute, there are
some references to contribution.
If Your Honors please, in order to determine whether

22

contribution is a remedy which will achieve congressional

23

intent, we think it's appropriate in the first place to

24

actually first analyze the statutes, take a look at Section 1

25

of the Sherman and at Section 4 of the Clayton Act.
13

And an analysis of these statutes clearly showed

1

2

that they are penal, they are punitive statutes, that they're

3

designed to provide both civil and criminal punishment for

4

violators of the antitrust laws.

5

Act establishes a violation, it defines illegal activities,

6

and it provides that every contract combination of conspiracy

7

that unreasonably restrains trade is illegal, and that every

8

person who engages in those illegal activities is guilty.

9

And it then provides for criminal penalties.

Section 1 of the Sherman

10

Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that any

1 1

person who is injured in his business or his property by

12

reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may recover

13

treble damages.
Now, when these statutes are read together, it be­

14
15

comes pretty clear that what constitutes the violations of

16

the antitrust laws and the penalties therefore, and that

17

there are really established two groups, those that can

18

recover treble damages and those that are liable for those

19

damages.

20

QUESTION:

But then to pursue that in pari delicto

21

concept, the statute treats them all in equal fault as with

22

a felony murder case, for example, does.

23

MR. SLATER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, sir, it does.
So should any court undertake to make

some different evaluations, saying one of them is more
14

1

or less at fault than the other?

2

MR. SLATER:

Well, that is one of the possible ways

3

of apportioning the liability among joint tortfeasors.

4

Now, certainly that has been done in some areas where contri­

5

bution is permitted.

6

or a relative culpability concept, which I think is what

7

Your Honor is referring to, where you in effect say, one is

8

more guilty -- put it that way -- than the others.

You have a comparative fault concept,

9

The difficulties with that approach is that at the

10

present time all cotortfeasors are equally liable and if you

11

approach it on the basis of an apportionment of fault, then

12

you will be calling on the courts at that point to in effect

13

referee degrees of fault as among wrongdoers and you are

14

calling on each of the tortfeasors to attempt to show that

15

he is not quite as wrong as the other fellow.

16

QUESTION:

But that is a recognized doctrine in some

17

states in tort law, isn't it? The dobtri’ne:of indemnification

18

where a passive tortfeasor can implead an active tortfeasor, even

19

though the plaintiff can go against the passive tortfeasors?

20

MR.

SLATER:

That's true, and it's also true that

21

there are some jurisdictions in which they actually apportion

22

fault,

23

comparative fault in order to achieve contributions.

24
25

based

on

whether you

felt

there's,

really

a

I think the indemnity situation is different, be­
cause there you're calling on someone to indemnify you for
15

1

100 percent, for whatever you're suing.
QUESTION:

2

But each is importing into the antitrust

3

laws a doctrine that has been either been rejected or acceptec

4

in the orthodox law of torts, whether it's comparative negli­

5

gence, indemnity, or contribution.
MR. SLATER:

6

Yes.

If Your Honors please, we believe

7

that it is clear that Congress intended that all persons

8

who violated the antitrust laws would be punished, would be

9

penalized, would be subjected to civil liability.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

be to make them all defendants, wouldn't it?

12

MR. SLATER:

MR. SLATER:

19

bution, because in order to make certain -QUESTION:

17
18

but that would be the opening --

15
16

Well, one way to guarantee that would

What I meant was, suing them in the first

instance.
MR. SLATER:

Yes, sir, that could be done.

But

20

when a plaintiff elects not to do that, there is at present

21

no way that a civil defendant who is sued can demand contribu­

22

tion from his alleged cotortfeasors.

23

QUESTION:

Well, the 1946 amendment to Rule 14 was

24

deliberately designed to prohibit a defendant from forcing a

25

plaintiff to sue another defendant, wasn't it?
16

MR. SLATER:

1

Yes, sir.

And we're not suggesting

2

that you in effect bring in a defendant and say, defendant,

3

you're in the case, as you do in admiralty,

4

for all purposes.

5

you can third-party your cotortfeasors and bring them in and

6

say, you are liable to me, and I am liable -- if I am liable

7

to the plaintiff.

What we're saying is that under Rule 14

tors can be assured, where the plaintiff can elect to sue one

or more coconspirators or levy against one or more coconspira­

Without contribution there is no

Now, if Your Honors please, the courts have recog­

16
17

nized that one of the major goals, or one of the major pur­

18

poses of the federal antitrust laws was to penalize wrong­

doers, to deprive violators of the antitrust laws of the

fruits of their illegal acts. And this Court, in the Brunswick

2

Your Honor, I've read that formula,

and --

3

QUESTION:

What's wrong with it?

4

MR. SLATER:

Well, what's wrong with it is that

without -- we cannot be liable to this plaintiff without joint

MR. CELLINI:

Well, Your Honor, what I am pointing

18

everyone in New Orleans knew about this alleged conspiracy,

damages against the parties that were charged with this

conspiracy in the indictment.

I think there is no basis upon which, unlike the

which such a remedy could be implied from the statute.

20

that point has been dealt with at some length by the Solicitor

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. McCREE:

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

8

The interest of the Government in this litigation

9

stems from its concern for the enforcement of the antitrust

10

laws and particularly from its interest in insuring the contin­

11

uing effectiveness of private actions under Section 4 of the

12

Clayton Act, particularly to accomplish the twin goals of the

13

Antitrust Act, which are compensation to the injured and

14

deterrence of would-be violators.

15

We submit that permitting defendants to seek contri­

16

bution may or may not affect the deterrence of private actions

17

but certainly it will so complicate litigation as to hamper

18

and perhaps frustrate the recovery by injured plaintiffs.

19

QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say that it kind of

20

puts a wild card in the game?

21

MR. McCREE:

That's a metaphor that I would adopt,

22

particularly in the deterrence.

23

it's going to fall, and we have referred to the economic

24

analysts in our brief, as has my brother Cellini, and their

25

conclusions are conflicting and indeterminate.
36

We just don't know which way

But everyone

is certain that to have contribution

We suggest that the Congress is the proper body in

the federal picture to address this subject because of its

6

many complexities.

7

that have preceded me has pointed out effectively that there

8

are many facets to this question of contribution, and that it

9

can be applied in many ways.

The Court in its colloquy with counsel

The manner in which it might be afforded lends it­

10
11

self to at least three analyses.

One, of course, the pro

12

rata amount, which depends on numbers alone;

13

share amount, which depends upon how much was sold; and the

14

other, the degree of culpability, which of course, would

15

require even more from the district judge confronted with

16

this determination.

17

applied in some combination in a particular case doesn't lend

18

itself easily to judicial determination, and is more properly

19

addressed to the Congress, which has the capacity for fine

20

tuning.

Whether one or all of these would be

analysts and others to inform

its judgment, something that

1 1

an individual district court would not have, and certainly

12

this Court does not have, with the other matters that

13

affect it.
We suggest that the proper analysis to this problem

14
15

is to regard the antitrust laws, as they are, as creating

16

statutory remedies, and we think the Court should pursue the

17

analysis that it has suggested in other instances when it

18

sought to endeavor whether the Congress implied a cause of

19

action.

20

of Chicago, suggest that the first inquiry should be, Is the

21

person seeking an implied cause of action a person for whose

22

benefit the statute was enacted?

23

Cort v. Ash, and the Cannon v. the University

I think it's entirely clear that the law violator,

24

the tortfeasor, is not the person for whose benefit this law

25

was enacted.

And to imply a cause of action for contribution
38

1

for him would fly in the face of the analysis that this Court

2

has followed in addressing other questions of this sort.
The Congress which enacted, of course, the antitrust

3
4

laws, has revised the antitrust laws from time to time.

5

1914 was the Clayton Act, of course; and again in 1974 and

6

19 7 6 without ever authorizing contribution. . Yet, the litera­

7

ture has suggested contribution before those periods, and the

Indeed it has.
Because I think the plaintiff in that

12

present in this case.

13

MR. McCREE:

We agree completely with the Court's

14

observation, Mr. Justice Stewart, and we think this is another

15

reason why we shouldn't do this.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Solicitor General, insofar as you

17

stress the importance of not complicating the plaintiff's

18

right to recover by burdening the litigation with a lot of

19

parties and so forth, could not that problem be solved by

20

requiring the claim for contribution to be asserted after

21

j udgment?

22

MR. McCREE:

That is a suggestion, Mr. Justice

23

Stevens, that has been made.

However, the plaintiff would

then, or the party seeking contribution, would have to go

25

forward again and establish the liability of the person
40

he sought to have contribute.

2

QUESTION:

You'd add to the burden of the courts,

3

of course, but I'm not sure it would add to the plaintiff's

4

burden, is what I was -MR. McCREE:

5

Oh, it would ease the Court's problem

6

but it would just make for further litigation with the lia­

7

bility question unaddressed.
QUESTION:

The plaintiff would have obtained his

judgment then, presumably.
MR. McCREE:

But there'd just be that many more

lawsuits after the fact.

15

many antitrust cases take 5-1/2 years to litigate, and that

16

the average is four years, and if one were to graft on to that

of new district judges and their average age,

about 50.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN R. SLATER, JR., ESQ.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

25

MR. SLATER:

If Your Honors please, insofar as the
42

1

question of the fairness argument is concerned, I think per­

2

haps the statement of the 8th Circuit in Professional Beauty

3

Supply puts the question a great deal more accurately than

4

I've been able to do.
In that case,

5

that

court,

considering

an

6

antitrust contribution concept, said, "We believe that the

7

question of deterrence actually cuts both ways, and on

8

balance a rule allowing contribution is actually a greater

9

deterrent.

The fact that one tortfeasor may be held liable

10

for the damages arising from the antitrust violation neces­

11

sarily means others may go scot free.

12

escaping all liability might cause many to be more willing

13

rather than less willing to engage in wrongful activity."

14

The possibility of

And it went on to say, "The deciding factor in our

15

decision is fairness between the parties.

16

fairness requires a right of contribution exist among joint

17

tortfeasors, at least under certain circumstances.

18

is an obvious lack of sense in justice in a rule which permits

19

the entire burden of restitution of a loss for which two

20

parties are responsible to be placed upon one alone because

21

of the plaintiff's whim or spite, or his collusion with the

22

other wrongdoer."

23

We conclude that

Industries can be liable to this plaintiff without the joint

responsibility of these respondents.

QUESTION:

Yet, didn't the 1946 Amendment to Rule 14

2

permit the plaintiff in any civil case brought in the United

3

States district courts to choose his defendant out of whim,

4

spite, any other reason?
MR. SLATER:

Well, he could choose his defendant;

certainly in an antitrust case he can choose his defendant,

QUESTION:

He presumably picks out the most conven­

13

ient and the most vulnerable, wouldn't you think that would

14

be a litigation tactic?

15

MR. SLATER:

Perhaps that's true, Your Honor.

16

In most instances, I think, you find that the plaintiff wants

17

to sue all those that he knows as coconspirators.

18

could have any number of reasons why he doesn't want to.

could be doing business with him, for example.

Well, perhaps, but at the same time -Anything wrong with that?
44

That's certainly true in criminal

matters; certainly true.

Can't argue with that.

10

that that's necessarily fair, but it certainly is the case

in criminal matters.

But as between those persons

depends upon whether or not you win.
MR. SLATER:

That's right.

Their defense is, if

24

they're not, if they did not conspire, then of course there's

25

no liability.
45

1

Insofar as the deterrence goes, I won't harp on

2

that, but it occurs to us that, as the Solicitor General

3

points out, the question of deterrence can cut both ways.

4

Certainly the argument can be made that to cause a company to

5

be exposed to the possibility of bearing the entire risk,

6

entire judgment, would be more of a deterring factor than

7

it would be for them to know that they could spread the risk.

8
9

On the other hand, there is a much better chance
of their knowing that they're going to get sued if there is

10

contribution.

11

four of the group of coconspirators are sued, you can rest

12

assured they are going to make certain that the other cocon­

13

spirators are brought into that case.

14

which is the greatest deterrent?

15

larger dollars, or is it the greater possibility of being

16

exposed to a judgment?

17

Because if then, if one or two or three or

So it's a question of

Is it the exposure to the

As a matter of fact, it occurs to us that the real

18

deterrent in antitrust matters is the criminal statute, and

19

that the possibility of fines and the possibility of jail

20

terms to those persons who are thinking of violating the law

21

is really the deterring factor.

22

about jail terms and they're not concerned about felony con­

23

victions and jail terms and hundred-thousand-dollar fines,

24

they're not going to be concerned about whether or not their

46

And if they're not concerned

SLATER:

Aren't you more apt to settle the case

23

It seems to me you have greater motivation

inclined to.

1

Wouldn't that be a general characteristic

2

of these proceedings, that if you have a possible recovery

over against nonparties, you'd have an additional reason for

not settling in every case?
MR. SLATER:

5

Well, I don't think so because, really,

what happens in these cases, though, they're long, they're
