the Court:
There may have been some doubt about the standing
of the previous case before the Court, but I can assure you
that the case now before you is certainly worthy of your
consideration; it has been a long time coming.
In federal criminal cases, voir dire is seriously
sick if unfettered judicial discretion may preclude any
inquiry as to racial prejudice,

Before this Court is both

a constitutional question, we would contend, under the Sixth
Amendment, the right to an impartial jury in
of course, of Ham and Ristaino.

the language

But more importantly is

the supervisory power -- and I'm directing your attention,
of course, to the opinion of Chief Justice Hughes in the
Aldridge case.
Unfortunately, in federal courts there has been
caught up this sense of expeditious resolve of voir dire.
It has become sometimes perfunctory, some have called it
3

1

-- commentators, even those working for the federal judicial
center, calling it "routinized ritual”.

It is unfortunate,

becuase it has strayed a long way from its original beginning.
And of course, some of that must be laid to rest at the feet
of counsel.

The

old days, and I think in this Court's opinion

in Swain,there was reference to protracted voir dire that

7

might exist in the state court system, but certainly not in
8

the federal courts.

My district, voir dire sometimes is 10

9

or 15 minutes; in the instant case it was 6.

The role of

10

counsel, even in submitting written questions, is squelched.
1 1

The role of counsel as an advocate, even implementing the
12

Sixth Amendment, effective assistance of counsel is a mere
13

nullity.

14

And what counsel has seen, and I must admit, as a
15

trial lawyer that there has been, unfortunately, didactic,
16

argumentative, repetitive voir dire by attorneys so as to
17

bring in the judge to direct and control the inquiry as to
18

voir dire.

We feel that Rule 24 clearly permits counsel,

19

as an advocate, to participate.

Rule 24, when designed, even

20

was -- permitted the defendant to inquire as to peers, as to
21

any serious

prejudice.

And when you have a question as

22

to racial prejudice and permit not one question on that issue,
23

what is the impartial jury?

Where did our American system go,

24

about having one free of prejudice, the impartial jury.
25

I'd like to talk about first, the facts of this

It's a little case but it's got a big issue, concern­

by the name of Humberto Rosales-Lopez, who’s charged with
4

alien smuggling, one of about six or seven, unfortunately he
5

exercised his right to trial by jury and had that right
6

accorded to him and was sentenced to 18 months confinement
7

followed by a 30-year suspended sentence.
8

QUESTION:

You lost me there a minute, Mr. Cleary.

9

You say, unfortunately he elected to trial by jury?
10

MR. CLEARY:

Yes, Your Honor, because in this case,

1 1

if you look at the disposition of the other defendants, par­
12

ticularly Virginia Bowling, who copped out and became the
13

government witness against him, who owned and operated the
14

drop house in southern California, she was given a misdemeanor
15

with a recommended probation.

And the other defendants in

16

the case split up, the worst one did 90 days time, of all people,
17

they didn't exercise the right to trial by jury.

And I'm

18

not saying, I'm not laying any blame anywhere, I'm just say­
19

ing that those who didn't go to trial, no matter what their
20

role in the enterprise was, max'd 90 days.

A person who goes

21

to trial by jury, 18 months followed by a 30 year suspended
22

sentence.

If there's a difference to be drawn there, I feel

23

there is, others may not, but that's not the issue before the
24

Court.

The issue, though,

is when a person asks for the

25

trial by jury, what type of justice does he get?

5

And I

1

think, in this case, it was a Mexican who was charged with
an offense involving aliens.

The critical government witness

was a Virginia Bowling, whose 19-year-old daughter, an
admitted junkie or heroin addict, by her mother's definition,

5

potentially involved in the same transaction involving this

6

alien smuggling venture, was mentioned throughout in the trial

Now the Petitioner, defendant in lower court, was
her lover, quasi-husband, whatever; living with this woman.
This woman was clearly Caucasian, and counsel, sensitive to
this issue, wanted the question asked about voir dire.

What

was important in this case was the effort one has to go to
get a question asked about racial prejudice.

Now this Court

is very sensitive -QUESTION:

MR. CLEARY:

That is correct.

No, but I mean -- counsel have to submit

after the judge asks, have you got any further

questions, you step up to the side bar and the request is

The trouble is, well I think the Court missed some;
7

1

I asked for six questions and the question I said, in this

case, I feel that inquiry should be made as to racial pre­

judice.

I think the Court is compelled, this is my language,

4

under Aldridge, a decision of this Court by Chief Justice
5

Hughes, to ask the question.

MR. CLEARY

Your Honor, in this case, I think we

12

it would be obvious.

And that further, that the jurors in

13

this case, would have before them, someone that they could

have a bias.

And that --

MR. CLEARY:

Your Honor, I can only state first,

that when any defendant might be the object of racial pre­

here, because the reason it wasn't, was that the daughter,
Kim -- there was some question as to whether or not we were
going to call her to testify.

this case, I had subpoenaed Kim, the daughter, and that rela­
tionship of the daughter vis a vis my client, would be an
issue.

12
13

Further, I think that it was pertinent in this case

that she didn't ultimately testify because the government
then subpoenaed

her, and it was a question of who was going

to use who for what purpose.

10
1 1

And as the record reflects in

I think, further, that when you have a Mexican
defendant charged in an alien smuggling case, in a community
in the proximity of the border, that those facts alone jus­
tify under Aldridge, an inquiry.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Cleary, have we ever

15

addressed the question whether discrimination against a
16

Mexican is racial discrimination?
17

MR. CLEARY:

Yes, Your Honor.

It would be my feel­

18

ing that the Courts decisions in, I believe it's the Texas
19

case, the most recent one is Castaneda v. Partida, where the
20

Court held that Mexican-Americans were a minority type of
21

group.
22

QUESTION:

Well minority, all right, but is the

23

discrimination racial, that's what I mean, technically
24

racial?
25

MR. CLEARY:

Well the question is as to -12

A different race?

MR. CLEARY:

Well I think that even if a person

7

were, say, a Mexican-American -8

QUESTION:

I don't suggest there may not--neverthe-

9

less, be the kind of discrimination you are arguing for, but
10

is it a racial discrimination?
1 1

MR. CLEARY:

Status as a Mexican is not.

And for

12

example, I could be a Mexican citizen.

And whether or not

13

a jury

is

prejudiced against me because of my Mexican

14

status, is irrelevant, because whether the person is a citizen
15

-- could it be a Mexican-American, sitting in the courtroom -16

QUESTION:

Well there might be discrimination against

17

the discreet minority of Mexicans --my brother Marshall has
18

been suggesting -- is that necessarily a racial discrimination
19

And I don't know that it is.
20

MR. CLEARY:

Well I think that in the context of

21

this case there was inquiry as to alienage and to an alien
22

problem.

But I think that that doesn't direct itself spe­

23

cifically to the point we're concerned with in this case, whic|h
24

is this antagonism.
25

To me, racism is an irrational belief in the
13

1

2
3
4

5

6
7

8
9

10

superiority of one's own racial or ethnic classification
so that, many times it will determine or turn on who the
particular object -- for example, a member of a minority
group could be prejudiced against a minority group under this
definition, and shouldn't you be allowed to probe that in a
federal criminal case.

In the context of this case, where

we had some glancing questions as to alienage, think of
what could happen in the penumbra of such an inquiry?
that could be directed towards the offense itself.

First,

We have

the response of one juror, when asked about aliens, what did

11

that bring up to her mind when asked about aliens.

Well

12

there's -- that's the name they used about persons who
13

transport prisoners -- I mean, persons who transport the alier s .

14

That concept right there, itself, tells us a little bit about
15

what that meant.

To that person it meant something to do with

16

people who move human flesh, which is an odious concern.

That

17

was not the nature of my inquiry.

The nature of my inquiry

18

was as to his racial descent, or racial background, or
19

descent.

And in my voir dire question to avoid the problem

20

raised by both Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr.

Justice Brennan,

21

I asked as to Mexican race or descent because of the possible
22

ambiguity in this area.
23

QUESTION:

Mr.

Cleary, I suppose it's an unspoken

24

premise of your entire argument that when you put a question
25

about ethnic or other prejudice that the person to whom the

14

1

question is addressed will immediately answer in good faith

2

and fully and honestly?

3
4

MR. CLEARY:

In fact, I believe

that that is --

6

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

human experiences admit prejudices when they have them?

ience reported in all the authorities who have undertaken to

12

MR. CLEARY:

Well Your Honor, the one difficulty

13

with that area is that there is -- if you

14

rhetorical, you know, would you be raising prejudice against

15

the defendant sitting here?

16

would say no.

QUESTION:

whole judicial system.

Mr. Cleary, let me call your attention

to the Appendix at page 18.

You've referred to a couple of

questions, that whereas by the district court, as glancing,
and I take it, one of them is the Court's question towards
the top of that page,!-- let me again ask the general question,
do any of you have any particular feelings one way or the
other about aliens or could you sit as a fair and impartial
juror if you are called upon to do so, in the back row.

And

then Juror Skelly responds, Christine Skelly, and I have
mixed feelings about it.

I don't think I could be impartial.

I have a tendency to feel my own feelings, I don't think I
could be a fair juror.

And then the judge goes ahead and

excuses her.
Don't you think the judge did enough here to alert
the jurors to the type of case and to the problems that they
might face along the line that you've outlined?
MR. CLEARY:

I don't think so, Justice Rehnquist,

and I think in this case if you look at -- what the question

22

was asked to measure the response, it could have been aliens
23

or the alien problems, it could have been the feeling about
24

the immigration laws, how a person feels about it.

It could

25

be a feeling about the poor, about the poor looking for a
16

1

better way of life when she says, my feelings which are

2

undefined by the very nature of the question.

3

Third, I think that there's a question as to how

4

do you feel about this individual sitting in this courtroom,

5

specificity.

6

there should have been some concrete direction or alerting

7

of the jurors as to this possible bias.

8

10

Because rather than dealing with an abstraction

QUESTION:

Well didn't he have the defendant stand

up?
MR. CLEARY:

Yes, he did, he did have to

stand.

11

And I think that would only trigger the fact that his pre­

12

sence as being a Latin, or one of the -- could have been the

13

subject of racial bigotry, was even just presented in that

14

fashion, and I think further, what's really critical about

15

this case, is that the perfunctory nature of the question and

16

further, after the voir dire, where counsel specifically

17

requests that the inquiry --- that it had to be made.

18

I think also to --

That was a statutory case, was it not?
It was, but it was dealing with the

terms we're dealing with here, and the bias of prejudice.

16

The Congress gave protection as to bias as to race or nation­

17

ality.

18

what I was trying to probe at was the protected area, that

19

is to say, discrimination against race or ethnic or nation­

20

ality classification.

21

22

24

25

It did not give protection as to alienage, and as to--

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Cleary, was the basis of your

concern that there exists in your community a bias against
Mexicans, or is it a bias against Mexicans engaged in bringing
in illegal aliens?
MR. CLEARY:

No, my concern is not as to the offense,
18

1

at all.

My concern is do any of these prospective jurors

2

have any type of bias against my client because of his
3

Mexican race or descent?
4

QUESTION:

Well that's what

is there any -- are

5

you suggesting that in the community generally there is a
6

bias against Mexicans, that they are looked down upon as a
7

minority, or something?
8

MR. CLEARY:

I think the history and tradition of

9

California is overwhelming in that respect, starting back
10

from the Californio days to studies now in California history
1 1

teachers -- they get a period of -- of rebuke --of the
12

Mexicans within the culture, originally California was a part
13

of Mexico.
14

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter that the offense was

15

importing the illegal aliens, it could have been any offense?
16

MR. CLEARY:

It could have been any offense, but

17

I think that it brings out the racial characteristic, because
18

you're going to have other individuals involved in it, and
19

again, the fact, the exploitation of people who themselves
20

might be Mexicans, might be another aggravating factor that
21

would be considered.
22

I would like to point out that the relief sought
23

here is no more than a simple standard that Aldridge be
24

complied with, that there the thought that -- and again, the
25

language of Chief Justice Hughes that someone who
19

might

1

have a bias beyond the jury, the trier of fact, cannot allow
2

this Court to stand.

Further, in Peters v. Kiff, you have a

3

long line of the cases where a white defendant was allowed to
4

assert the fact that members of the -- blacks were not in­
5

cluded in a prospective panel.
6

The Court held that -7

QUESTION:

Mr. Cleary, would your rule apply to a

8

Mexican-American charged with murdering a Mexican-American?
9

MR. CLEARY:

Yes, Your Honor, it would.

10

QUESTION:

I thought so.

QUESTION:

I thought your primary or first argument,

11
12

is that a trial judge is obligated to ask this question of a
13

prospective juror whenever defense counsel requests that he
14

ask the question?
15

MR. CLEARY:

Right.

That was my --

16

QUESTION:

Regardless of what may be a court as

17

a Sunday morning quarterback would see as a possibility of
18

racial prejudice in a particular case, either by the reason
19

of the charge in the case or the race of the defendant.
20

I mean possibly the defendant might be a Caucasian.

And the

21

offense might be a bank robbery, of a white owned and operated
22

bank.

Nonetheless, if you have -- I thought your initial

23

submission was that if defense counsel asks that this question
24

be asked to the jury that it must be asked?
25

MR. CLEARY:

That is my submission.
20

Your Honor, and

1

the point I --

3

QUESTION:

Provided the defendant is a Mexican?

QUESTION:

No, no.

4

MR. CLEARY:
5

6

No.

No, what I'm trying to say,

Justice Stewart, you hit the nail on the head.

My position,

basically,,is that race can go any direction, not just against

7

minorities -8

QUESTION:

By a whole Negro jury, who are just

9

prejudiced against Whiteys?
10

MR. CLEARY:

Precisely.

And the answer is --

11

QUESTION:

And the all Negro jury

opposed against

12

Negroes ?
13

MR. CLEARY:

There --

14

QUESTION:

You could have that.

15

MR. CLEARY:

Well I think that a person --

16

QUESTION:

Is there any way -- is there any end to

QUESTION:

No, no.

17

this ?
18

No end at all.

19

MR. CLEARY:

Your Honor, I think that when you deal

20

with racial prejudice, we're dealing with such a touchy and
21

very sensitive area, that if counsel who hopefully are not
22

incompetent, seriously want the inquiry made,

for the

23

Court to deny it, I think, would be improper.
24

QUESTION:

Well what about religion?

25

MR. CLEARY:

That's not before the Court.
21

The

1

2
3
4

religious issue might be -- either way, is how the Court
would construe Connors, it didn't allow political inquiry.
Religion may, in the terms of the particular case, be appro­
priate, but what I'm suggesting basically, is the race.

5

I would like to reserve --

6
7

QUESTION:

Mr. Cleary, before you sit down, let

me be sure I understand -- I may not have caught the full

8

thrust of your argument.

Suppose this trial was in Alaska

9

or Maine, and there aren't any -- haven't been any Mexicans
10

in the state for 100 years, and the crime has nothing to do
11

with Mexicans, you mean to say the trial judge had the duty
12

to ask a question about prejudice against Mexicans?
13

QUESTION:

If requested by the defendant?

14

MR. CLEARY:

There is no --

15

QUESTION:

Suppose he has to ask a) Mexicans, b)

16

Negroes, c) Catholics, d) what -- made a list of 100.

Would

17

he

have to askthem all?

18

MR. CLEARY:

No, in fact, I think what is the pur­

19

pose is, one, it shouldn't be sua sponte.

Two, it must be

20

upon the request of counsel -21

QUESTION:

I understand.

But I'm having counsel

22

ask, he doesn't know, maybe the -- man has a great uncle who
23

was French, he wants to know is there any prejudice for or
24

against French?
25

MR. CLEARY:

I think it has to be in the context of
22

1

the particular case.
2

QUESTION:

It has to be one of the defendants.

QUESTION.:

But that's different now.

3
4

MR. CLEARY:

No, I'm saying only as to the defen­

5

dant, but as to any particular case.

Meaning, I'm not saying,

6

if he comes in and asks prejudice about blacks, whatever, I
7

think that as to anything, any hostility of the prospective
8

jurors towards the racial or ethnic classification of any
9

particular defendant, any particular defendant, not just
10

Mexican defendants.
1 1

QUESTION:

Well I understand, but need not -- you're

12

not even arguing that the defendant in the case in which the
13

request is made has to be of the racial or national origin
14

to which the question pertains?
15

MR. CLEARY:

No.

No, I think you have to ask -- I

16

could not ask if -- in my case, are you prejudiced against
17

blacks, because my client was Mexican.
18

QUESTION:

Exactly.

19

MR. CLEARY:

My question was, precisely only

20

antagonisms as towards Mexicans.
21

QUESTIONS:

Well all right.

But then, I didn't

22

understand your answer I guess.
23

QUESTION:

Well but what about witnesses?

I mean,

24

if you have a white client but plan to call a Mexican witness
25

and a black witness, or -- and an Armenian witness and a
23

1

Swedish witness and a Finnish w7itness, presumably you

vir­

2

tually need

a textbook on anthropology in order to conduct

3

voir dire.
4

MR. CLEARY:

The witness would not be on trial.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the witness may not be on trial,

6

but the fact that the jury were prejudiced against the
7

testimony of the witness might seriously impair the fairness
8

of the trial.
9

MR. CLEARY:

That is a possible thing, but we're

10

dealing with the unfettered -1 1

QUESTION:

Mr. Cleary, suppose the defendant is

12

a blond, blue-eyed Mexican or Negro.

Would you have to

have to give both, the -16

QUESTION:

Bear in mind now, I'm going to -- well,

20

I wanted to warn you that I was going to ask you why.
21

MR. CLEARY:

The answer, I think, in that case is

22

that I think a person who might have those exhibits might

trigger off some hostility, which it could be -- sensitively

QUESTION:

Trigger hostility, they wouldn't even

an informed judgment; if he thought the individual might be

acceptable and the -5

QUESTION:

So counsel is going to run the government ?

6

MR. CLEARY:

No, I —

7

QUESTION:

Whenever counsel makes up his mind that--

8

this is your position, is it not -- that whenever counsel make s
9

up his mind, that that charge is necessary, the judge must
10

give it.

Isn't that where you end up?

1 1

MR. CLEARY:

In the inquiry as to racial prejudice,

12

that is correct, Your Honor.
13

QUESTION:

I have one other question, if I may.

Now 3

14

this is -- how, this follows up with what Justice Brennan
15

asked you,

how significant is -- in your argument, is the

16

factor of race?

Supposing you had a student who was shown to

17

be an Iranian, and -- an Iranian citizen, would you, under
18

yoqr argument, be entitled to ask the jury if -- could they
19

give a fair trial to an Iranian student?
20

MR. CLEARY:

Excuse me.

The question as to student

21

status might not be pertinent; but to being Iranian, I think
22

that that would be correct.
23

QUESTION:

So that the racial aspect is not critical

24

Rather, it's some characteristic of the defendant that you thi
25

might give rise to some prejudicial reaction?
25

ik

MR. CLEARY:

1

Race is a difficult term to define,

2

but it usually includes not only physical characteristics,

3

but certain ethnic delineations that have certain physical

4

characteristics with it.

5

acteristics -- in my case, brown skin, a certain appearance,

6

dark hair -- that then, the inquiry must be made.
But I think

And so, it has the physical char­

cumstances .

I think --

QUESTION:

10

Why would that be different?

I mean,

11

if you have neighborhoods in big cities where there are pre­

12

judices -- the German neighborhood right across the street

13

from a neighborhood of -- say, a Polish neighborhood, why

14

wouldn't you have the same right there?
MR. CLEARY:

15

Because I think, and again, I'm not

16

trying to get into anthropology, I think the classifications

17

would not define all of those -- I don't think you could call

18

-- say, Germans, and French different races.
QUESTION: Well but what difference does it make

19

20

whether -- why is race significant to your argument at all?

21

I think the -- I thought the touchstone would be potential

22

prejudice ?

23

MR. CLEARY:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well I think -If you've got a group of people who may

be the object of prejudice within a community, why does it

make any difference whether they are black or Iranian, I
just don't understand?

I think that voir dire has

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.,
20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
21

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

22

the Court:
23

After explaining that the defendant in this case
24

was charged with smuggling illegal aliens into the United
25

States, and that the purpose of voir dire was to uncover
29

1

any underlying prejudices, the trial court specifically asked

2

the jurors whether any of them had any feelings about aliens,

3

or the illegal alien problem.

4

that any of the jurors in this case assumed that the trial

5

court's questions excluded Mexican aliens, or any strong

6

feelings they might have had about the Mexican illegal alien

7

problem, particularly in light of what Petitioner refers to

8

as his obvious Mexican appearance.

9

QUESTION:

It seems to us highly unlikely

Are we to assume that you — - that the

10

United States thinks the, if the question about aliens hadn't

1 1

been asked there would have been error here?

MR. JONES:

We don't believe that circumstances of

this case provide any substantial basis for asking any more
than what the trial court -QUESTION: I know.

But what if he hadn't asked

about aliens?
MR. JONES:

The question was about illegal aliens.

QUESTION:

Was there enough -- was this the kind of

a case where some kind of a question about alienage or

Mexican

Americans should have been asked?
MR. JONES:

Well if the trial court hadn't asked

either the question about aliens or illegal immigration, it
would be a much closer case.

But since the trial court did

ask those questions, the issue in this case is essentially
whether petitioner's proposed question would have been
30

1

significantly more effective in uncovering bias against
2

Mexicans than the question the trial court did ask.
3

This Court's cases don't suggest that questions
4

about racial bias or racial prejudice, need to be put in any
5

particular form,

in Ham this Court specifically disclaimed

6

any intention --to impose such a requirement.

The Court's

7

questions in this case were more than adequate to satisfy
8

both the constitutional rule and the federal common law rule.
9

A panel of jurors drawn from the Southern District
10

of California could hardly have failed to understand the
1 1

trial judge's questions to include bias against Mexican
12

aliens and any strong feelings they might have had about
13

the illegal alien problem, illegal Mexican

alien problems.

14

The only bias that wasn't covered by the questions the trial
15

court asked, only conceivable bias that wasn't covered is
16

bias against Americans with Mexican ancestry.

Petitioner of

17

course, was not an American, and there's no reason at all to
18

assume that the jurors in this case would have been biased
19

against Mexican Americans but not Mexican aliens.
20

Throughout the proceedings in the Courts below, the
21

Petitioner -- and in fact, in this Court as well -- Petitioner
22

argues that the trial court was obliged to ask this additional
23

question only because this Court's decisions required it.
24

Neither Ham nor Aldridge nor any other decision of this Court
25

purported to establish a per se rule to be applied without
31

regard to the facts of the case.

rule' is triggered only if race or racial bias is inextricably
bound up with the issues at trial, that simply wasn't the
case here.

The federal common law rule announced in Aldridge

requires the questions specifically directed to racial bias
or at least something more than a general question only when
the nature of the offense or the facts of the case suggest
that there is a strong or substantial likelihood that racial
bias will affect the jury's deliberations.

The decision in

Aldridge does not rest on the assumption that only a question
s pecifically mentioning race is sufficient to uncover racial
bias.

Nor does it rest on the assumption that a question

that does not mention race is necessarily insufficient.
QUESTION:
inary question?

Mr. Jones, can I interrupt for a prelim­

In the procedure that was followed by the

trial judge here, was the government given an opportunity to
object to the questions proposed by defense counsel to be
asked by the Court?

And if so, did the government object

to this particular question?
MR. JONES:

The questions were submitted in writing,

prior to trial, and therefore the government of course had an
opportunity to object.

There's no indication that the govern­

ment did object, however.
QUESTION:

Immediately prior to --

So you wouldn't know -- the government
32

1

doesn't take the position that there would have been anything

2

wrong with the judge asking the question, it's just that it

3

wasn't necessary to do so?

4

MR. JONES:

Right.

And there was particularly

5

nothing wrong with asking the question in light of the ques­

6

tions that were asked, but in addition to that, the federal

7

common law rule that Petitioner relies on does not at all

8

suggest that the question should be asked whenever the De­

9

fendant requests it, but only when the likelihood that racial

10

bias will affect the jury's deliberations is substantial.

1 1

In Ristaino, this Court made it fairly clear that something

12

more than a general question was required, but the rule is

13

only required because the facts indicate a need for it.

14

the additional protection provided by asking more specific

15

questions was thought necessary.

16
17

And

The facts of both Ristaino

and Aldridge underscore the point.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, let me ask one other question.

18

Supposing this had been a black defendant and the request had

19

been framed in terms of racial prejudice specifically.

20

you say that -- and the crime had actually nothing to do with

21

a black/white problem -- would you say that the judge would

22
23
24
25

Would

have had a duty to ask the questions?
MR. JONES:

Certainly not.

As I said, the federal

common law rule adopted in Aldridge, or announced in Aldridge,
only requires a question more specific than a general question

33

3
4
5

6
7

8
9
10
11

12
13
14
15
16

when the facts or the circumstances surrounding the case
suggest there is some particularly substantial likelihood
that racial bias will be a factor in the case or influence
the jury's deliberations.

Ristaino and Aldridge,black defendants were charged with
crimes of violence directed at white law enforcement officers.
In Aldridge the defendant was charged with murder, and in
Ristaino, assault with intent to murder.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

In cases involving

crimes of interracial violence, the danger that racial pre­
judice will affect the deliberations of the jury, is partic­
ularly substantial for some of the jurors are likely to
identify with the victim and view the case as us against them,
and of course, crimes of violence are inherently more likely
to evoke strong emotional reactions in jurors than most non­
violent crimes.
The Petitioner's attempt in this Court and in his

There's simply -- in both

late.

daughter,
In the District

Court, Petitioner said nothing, absolutely nothing to the
District judge about the possibility that this relationship
with Bowling's daughter would be mentioned at trial.

And as

Justice Marshall pointed out, it's the duty of counsel to point
out the facts which will support a request for a specific ques­
tion.

Having failed to do that, he
34

should not be allowed to

1

rely on it now.

But even if Petitioner had raised the point

2

in the District Court, refusal to ask the question in this
3

case would not have constituted an abuse of discretion.
4

QUESTION:

Well it would have in some other circuits

5

wouldn't it?

MR. JONES:

Well, there's no discretion in some

other circuits .

That's what I -- so it's not, you would

9

even get to the discretion problem?
10

MR. JONES:

That's right.

defendant belongs to one race or another, and -20

Honor.

The Rule provides that the Court may allow counsel

6

to conduct voir dire, may itself conduct voir dire, if the
7

Court conducts voir dire it should allow counsel to ask sup­
8

plemental questions or

submit

supplemental questions that

9

it deems proper.
10

QUESTION:

Right.

Every case it says may.

11

MR. JONES:

Right.

Except that, it says shall

12

permit counsel to submit supplemental questions.
13

QUESTION:

And there was no denial of that?

14

MR. JONES:

That's right. And in each case, the

15

trial judge as Rule 24 suggests, should be allowed to look
16

at the circumstances of the case and determine whether there's
17

any particular need for the kinds of questions or whether as
18

the trial judge did in this case, questions other than spe­
19

cific questions posed by counsel were sufficient.
20

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, supposing you had an ordinary

21

burglary trial, had no racial overtones, and about a week
22

after the Pearl Harbor bombing, and the defendant was a
23

Japanese.

Would he have had a right to have this kind of

24

question asked about potential prejudice against Japanese?
25

MR. JONES:

Certainly.
36

1

QUESTION:

Well why?

2

MR. JONES: Because under the circumstances, it

3

would be very likely that jurors would find his -- his

4

status as Japanese --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

7

8
9

Fact that he's Japanese.
-- somewhat offensive, or at least

be very sensitive.
QUESTION:

You're really moving out, now.

What

about the Germans?

10

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. JONES:

Excuse me?
What about Germans and Italians?
At that point, it seems to me that

13

these two questions underscore the need to allow the trial

14

judge and the district courts to look at the circumstances

15

of the case and determine whether a specific question is

16

necessary or not.

17

QUESTION:

Well then, Mr. Jones, you are saying no

18

more, I take it, than that it might be an abuse of dis­

19

cretion to decline to ask the question Justice Stevens

20

suggested to you, not a constitutional per se rule?

21

MR. JONES:

22

QUESTION:

23

That's right.
You weren't suggesting that there should

be a constitutional rule on this?

24

MR. JONES:

25

QUESTION:

No.
Well, of course, nobody's arguing
37

1

the constitutional rule.
2

MR. JONES:

Excuse me?

3

QUESTION:

Nobody's arguing the constitutional

4

rule.

It's a question of supervisory power.

5

MR. JONES:

I'm not entirely sure that Petitioner

6

isn't arguing for constitutional -7

QUESTION:

Well he's arguing for either alternative.

QUESTION:

My question was in the disjunctive

8
9

constitutional or per se rule.

Per se rule, under supervisory

10

power.

That isn't what you were conceding?

1 1

MR. JONES:

No.

It seems to us that --

12

QUESTION:

Well excuse me, finish with the Chief

13

Justice.
14

MR. JONES:

The per se rule is, under the circum­

15

stances, unnecessary in this area.

And it would cause as

16

many problems as it would resolve, since you have questions
17

like
18

QUESTION:

Well Mr. Jones,

you may

understand

19

what I'm talking about, whether it's a constitutional rule or
20

a supervisory rule, it would

end up in being a per se rule?

21

Is that what they're arguing for?
22

MR. JONES:

I think they are arguing that there is

23

a per se rule, at least as

to

supervisory power, and that --

24

QUESTION:

So there is

no

25

just want a per se rule either way?
38

difference;

QUESTION:

That's the way I

MR. JONES:

I think that's

5

That's right.
am I right, Mr. Jones 7
I am inclined to agree

with your interpretation.
QUESTION:

Would you think that would be equally

6

applicable as to the need, now, the need from the defendant's

7

point of view, if the defendant has a substantial criminal

8

record but may want to take the stand?

9

that we're talking about that's being advocated, indicate

10

that the question would be required, would you as a juror

1 1

be biased against a person if it developed that he had four

12

criminal convictions?

13

MR. JONES:

Would such a rule

Well there are constitutional impli­

14

cations to that question that I am not prepared

15

with at present.

16

there is no need for a per se rule, and a per se rule would

17

be completely unnecessary, or inappropriate.

judge, looking at the case -- the defendant says well, I may

or may not want to testify.

20

vations about asking questions but if the defendant can have

21

his conviction reversed because the trial court refused to

22

ask the question under those circumstances, it seems to us

23

that the rule is charged with causing more problems than it

24

is eliminating.

25

to deal

But it seems to me that too is a case where

QUESTION:

The trial

The trial judge may have reser­

Well what do you suggest, Mr. Jones,
39

1

should be the standard by which, if it's not a per se rule,

2

the trial judge should decide whether they will or won't ask

3

the question that the defense counsel requests?
MR. JONES:

4

The standard should be and I think, is,

5

that only when the facts of the case or the nature of the

6

charge suggest that there is some substantial likelihood that

7

racial bias will intrude on the deliberations of the jury.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well counsel here had suggested to the

judge, one of the reasons I'd like that question asked in this

10

case is that it's likely to come out during the trial a

1 1

relationship between this young lady and the defendant

12

in

13

the judge still refused to ask the question,

14

thought that was the question?

15

MR. JONES:

that

circumstance,

had he

done so and
Would you have

A closer question, Your Honor.

But

16

still a question of judgment, and one that the district court

17

who has

18

asked before, is in a much better position to answer than I

19

am.

20

seen the answers of all the jurors to the questions

QUESTION:

Well isn't it true, counsel, that in a

21

case such as this involving illegal smuggling of aliens,

22

people of entirely Caucasian background might have quite

23

different feelings;

24

who is smuggling illegal aliens because they could use them

25

for labor on -- in agri-business, and that sort of thing,

some might be very sympathetic to someone

40

1

whereas others might feel that, you know, we just don't want

2

any people like that in this state.

3

extend in any direction.

4

MR. JONES:

I mean the prejudice can

That's absolutely true, Your Honor.

It

5

seems to us that it makes absolutely no sense to assume that

6

all people of one race have identical feelings about any

7

particular question and --

15

QUESTION:

voir dire, you're not assuming that everybody has -- you're
trying to find that one rare person who may have the prejudice
and you want to get him off the jury.

without regard to what the facts of the case might have been,
there probably are some people in San Diego or Los Angeles
who are prejudiced against Mexicans and -MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

-- what's wrong with trying to find out

Okay.

And they would have been iden­

tified by the questions that were asked and --

21

22

And they would have been --

who they are?

19

20

And you -- I doubt if

you would suggest that it's totally fantastic to assume that

16

18

Mr. Jones, you're not -- when you conduct

QUESTION:
asked.

There's no question about Mexicans were

Questions about illegal smuggling and all that, I

suppose everybody's against illegal smuggling.
MR. JONES:

Illegal -- whether the jurors had any

feelings about illegal alien problems, that would prevent
41

1

them from serving -2

QUESTION:
3

But some of these people, I'm hypothe­

sizing, may actually be out there, are people who are not

4

concerned about illegal aliens but they just don't like
5

Mexicans, period; legal, illegal, citizen, whatever they are.
6

There are such people, you know, who are prejudiced.
7

MR. JONES:

Your Honor -- for sure, I have no doubt

8

that there are, Your Honor, but -9

QUESTION:

And what's wrong with trying to find out

10

who they are before you let them sit on the jury?
11

MR. JONES:

They could have found out who they were

12

by asking the questions about aliens.

Since, virtually any­

13

body in California, or in southern California, especially in
14

San Diego County which borders Mexico -- 170 miles of border
15

between Mexico -- and as this Court pointed out, a few years
16

back, the government had estimated that 85 percent of the
17

illegal aliens in the country were Mexicans.

And it seems to

18

me highly unlikely that anybody living, particularly in San
19

Diego County could conceivably have thought that this question
20

about illegal aliens doesn't really reach my bias against
21

Mexicans.
22

QUESTION:

Mrs. Bowling lived in Imperial Beach, did

23

she not?
24

MR. JONES:

That's right.

25

QUESTION:

Which is about what, 8-10 miles from the
42

1

border?

2
3

MR. JONES:

Right.

And the trial took place in

San Diego.

4

QUESTION:

What you're saying is that no juror

5

-- intellectually qualified to sit on the jury would have

6

thought they were talking about Finlanders or Swedes or South

7

Africans, but only about illegal Mexicans?

8
9

MR. JONES:

Or, not even only about illegal Mexicans,

but at least including illegal Mexicans.

As the Petitioner

10

again -- to return to the Petitioner's reliance on the rela­

11

tionship with Bowling's daughter -- it seems that the trial

12

13
14
15

court's questions were at least, at least as effective in
identifying the jurors, prospective jurors who might have
found the relationship objectionable as the question about
whether or not the jurors would have --

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, just to emphasize one point,

the government's position would be precisely the same as far
as the bottom line is concerned if none of these other
questions had been asked about illegal smuggling,.as I under­
stand you?

You just don't have to ask a question that is

merely related to the race or national origin of the person
even though the community might harbor prejudice against
that particular race or minority.

That's your bottom line,

as I understand it, Mr. Jones?
MR. JONES:

Our position would be the same in the
43

1

sense that the legal analysis would be the same.

We might

2

say that in a particular case it was error for failure to
3
ask some other questions, but not that there's some different
4
legal standard to be applied.
5
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll reflect further

6

on that during the noon hour and we will resume at one
7
o'clock.

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr.

Jones, we've used

10

about five minutes of your time but we won't charge it to you;
11

you have ten minutes remaining.
12

MR. JONES:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and may

13
it please the Court:
14
In further response to Mr.

Justice Stevens' question

15
at the close of the last session, the government doesn't
16
believe that there is any harm in asking a question or two
17
concerning potential racial bias, provided that the question­
18
ing is not interminable.

But under Rule 24(a), Federal

19
Rules of Criminal Procedure, whether a particular question
20

should be asked in light of all of the surrounding circum21

tances and if so, in what form,

is left to the trial court's

22

discretion subject to appellate review for abuse of discretion
23
Petitioner's suggestion that this Court in the exercise of
24
its supervisory power ought to restructure the federal voir
25
dire system is flatly contrary to Rule 24(a).

44

Similar

1

suggestions were made and implicitly rejected at the time

2

Rule 24 was initially considered.

3

amended it should be amended by the rulemaking or rule

4

amending procedures set up for that purpose.

5

If the rule Is to be

In conclusion, a jury verdict based on virtually

6

overwhelming evidence should not be reversed solely because

7

the trial court failed to mention the obvious.

8

asked by the trial court were sufficiently specific to

that the proposed question could have been any more effective

to that end.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be

affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
