ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ABRAMS:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This consolidated case comes to this Court on

1 1

writs of certiorari to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the

12

District of Columbia.

13

affirming two 4 to 3 rulings of the Federal Communications

14

Commission that ABC, CBS and NBC violated Section 312(a)(7)

15

of the Federal Communications Act by declining to sell one

16

half hour of prime time on their networks to the Carter-

17

Mondale Committee during a specified four-day period, during

18

the first week in December of 1979 -- a time 11 months before

19

the national election, 8 months before the Democratic Na­

20

tional Convention, almost three months before the first

21

primary, and over a month and a half before the first offic­

22

ial contest of any sort in which there was voter participa­

23

tion -- the Iowa caucus.

24

not an application for time in Iowa, with respect to the Iowa

25

caucus -- which was, as I've said, about a month and a half

It involves a decision of that court

I wish to emphasize i/that this was

4

1

away; this was for time from the national networks to be

2

broadcast on those national networks around the nation.

3

it is the failure of the networks to sell the precise time

4

sought at the time it was sought that the Commission has

5

found in the statute's language, unreasonable; even though

6

CBS, for example, immediately offered to sell two five-

7

minute periods of time during the time-periods that it was

8

sought, and ABC offered to sell time in the first week of

9

January of 1980.

10

And

The facts of the case are easily stated and, I

1 1

think, not disputed.

12

on behalf of the Carter-Mondale campaign to each of the

13

three networks, seeking to purchase a half hour of time

14

during specified time-periods in the first week of December.

15

It was said in these letters that the needs of the Carter-

16

Mondale campaign were such that the time was required to

17

kick off the campaign.

18

precisely the time that was requested, on the evenings that

19

they were sought.

20

Carter-Mondale campaign by way of response, and then to the

21

Commission.

22

their reasons, as I said -- CBS made an immediate offer to

23

sell two five-minute periods- of time; ABC advised that it

24

would sell time in early 1980 and prior to the time the

25

Commission ruled, offered to sell time in the first week of

In October 1979, letters were written

Each made a submission, first to the

January, 1980.

NBC initially declined to sell the half-

2

hour at the time that it was sought, and when a half hour

3

was sought in early January, NBC offered to sell it at that

4

time.
The length of time before the election and the

5

amount of potential requests for equal opportunities under

7

Section 315 of the

8

requests for time were cited separately by each of the net­

9

works in their responses.

Federal Communications Act, and other

ABC and NBC pointed, for example,

10

to the fact that they had not sold national network time in

11

the 1976 election until March and April of that election year

12

CBS pointed to the fact that it had already received requests

13

from the Connally campaign on September 14th and the Reagan

14

campaign on September 21.
QUESTION:

15
16

effect in 1976, was it?
MR. ABRAMS:

17
18

It was in effect in 1976, it never

resulted in any litigation.
QUESTION:

19

20

The statute involved here was not in

But it was in effect at the time that

the --

21

MR. ABRAMS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes.

It was passed in 1972.

Passed in
Seventy-two, the Federal Election

24

Campaign Act.

On its face, this statute, which

25

312(a)(7) is one of 7 subsections of
6

is.

Section

Section 312(a) of

1

the Federal Communications Act, setting forth acts that

2

can lead to license revocation.

3

course I won't read it, but it includes such things as

4

the making of false statements on the application for a

5

license, the violation of cease and desist orders of the

6

Commission, the willful or repeated failures to operate

7

substantially as set forth in the license and the like.

8
9

The list is simple, of

None of these imposed any new, substantive obli­
gations .

All of them imposed the risk of sanctions upon the

10

networks or of the stations involved, broadcast stations,

11

it was said if there was violation.

12

at issue today

13

Our section, the one

as adopted in the Federal Election Campaign

• Act prohibits the following:

willful or repeated failure

14

to allow reasonable access to or to permit purchase of

15

reasonable amounts of time of time for the use of a broad­

16

cast station by a legally qualified candidate for federal

17

elective office on behalf of his candidacy.

18

If the Court please, it is now the position of

19

the Commission that the plain meaning of those words leads

20

inexorably to the conclusion that ABC, say, which offered

21

to sell time in January 1980 rather than December 1979, is

22

in plain violation of the statute.

23
24
25

We maintain that that

is not so -QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, do you deny that the

Commission could take that into consideration at the time
7

1

the station's license comes up for renewal?
MR. ABRAMS:

2

We think that it was proper to take

3

into account a charge by a complainant at the time the

4

charge is made, Justice Rehnquist, the violation of Section

5

312(a)(7).

6
7

8
9

QUESTION:

The same way any of the other

conditions for license renewal could be considered?
MR. ABRAMS:

It's an appropriate thing to be

considered then; the fashion in which the Commission has

10

handled it is the fashion akin to the way its handled fair­

1 1

ness doctrine complaints, which is to say, on a case by

12

case approach, which we think is an entirely proper way to

13

approach it, we do not object to the fact that when a

14

complaint is made with respect to Section 312(a)(7), the

15

Commission makes a ruling then as to whether the complaint

16

is justified or not.

17

But I agree that if someone believes at license

18

renewal time that there is a violation of any portion of

19

Section 312(a), that's an appropriate thing to be considered

20

by the Commission.

21

QUESTION:

Well what did the Court of Appeals

22

grant the Commission here?

23

doing here that was different from that?

24
25

MR. ABRAMS:

Or affirm the Commission's

Our objection to what the Court of

Appeals affirmed had nothing to do with the propriety of
8

1

a complaint being filed.

2

the Court of Appeals and the Commission applied the wrong

3

standard in making its decision as to whether the networks

4

acted reasonably.

alleging violation of what he says are the terms of the

Federal Communications Act.

9

was true under the public interest standard as well, because

Our objection is that we believe

So we don't come to you to say that a

He may, and indeed that was

10

if one thing I think is common ground

11

is that at least since this Court's decision in WDAY and

12

really long before, it has been clear that broadcasters

13

have been obliged under the public interest standard to sell

14

some time to candidates and that it would be a violation of

15

their public interest requirements if they refused to do so.

between us here, it

16

Now there was a different standard applied under

17

the public interest standard and that's one of the reasons

18

that I'm here today.

19

but that a candidate could file a complaint in front

20

the Commission and indeed candidates did file complaints

21

in front of the Commission long before Section 312(a)(7)

22

existed and that the Commission would rule on the propriety

23

of the conduct of the station involved.

24
25

QUESTION:

But there was never any question
of

Mr. Abrams, how is the -- I take it

that it is possible for a network to violate 312(a)(7) by
9

1

certain kinds of conduct even within your construction of

2

it?

3

MR. ABRAMS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice
How would the Commission go about

5

remedying that, you say there would be a complaint and

6

then adjudication?

7

8
9
10

MR. ABRAMS:

A complaint would be filed, there

would be an adjudication -QUESTION:

And what would the Commission do then?

MR. ABRAMS:

As a practical matter, the Commis­

11

sion would have to do no more than it did here, .to make a

12

ruling that the network had acted, or that the language of

13

the statute --

MR. ABRAMS:

a declaratory judgment?

It is, as it were, a declaration -It

has

no authority to issue a cease

and desist order or to order you to do anything, does it?
MR. ABRAMS:
only to revoke.

It has the power, under 312(a)(7)

It --

QUESTION:

I wonder, is that what a complaint says

21

when it is filed with the Commission, the network has. vio­

22

lated 312(a)(7) and therefore you should revoke its license?

23
24
25

Is that what it says?
MR. ABRAMS:

No sir.

What the Carter-Mondale

campaign said was that you should tell the network to sell
10

1

2
3
4

the time on one of the evenings that we are requesting
it and that is, in effect, precisely what the Commission
did.

Now if that had not been stayed by the Court of

Appeals as it was and by the judicial process as it was, and

5

if the networks had violated that direction at the very

6

least they would have acted at considerable peril, surely

direct command of the commission with respect to what their
obligation was.

QUESTION:

work did violate the 312(a)(7) and it was sustained in
Court, and as final judgment the Commissioner actually
could revoke the license without waiting for license renewal
time.

If there were a willful or repeated

failure within the meaning of the statute --

Do you think -- I take it that right

on its face, that the Commission did violate -- if the net­

And that's the same way the Fairness

MR. ABRAMS:

I understand, I understand that.
But what the statutory language

provides is that if that occurs that this is an allowable
sanction.

And I don't quarrel

: with the fact that -11

QUESTION:

So really all the Commission does

is issue a declaratory judgment -MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, and the network -- the station

understands -QUESTION:

And then the network has to decide

what it's supposedly going to do about it.
MR. ABRAMS:

Well it doesn't have an awful lot

of choice, Mr. Justice.

9

QUESTION:

Oh exactly.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams, is it conceivable that

1 1

over a period there would be a number of complaints, two,

12

three or four, by the candidates or committees, on which

13

the Commission would give no relief but then at the renewal

14

stage, under United Church of Christ, among other things,

15

examine whether there was a pattern of favoring one kind of

16

a candidate, or one candidate or one party and take that

17

into account in the renewal proceedings?

18

MR. ABRAMS:

It's appropriate at the renewal pro­

19

ceedings for the Commission to take into account the conduct

20

of the broadcaster, including to be sure --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ABRAMS:

For the entire three-year period?
-- compliance -- yes sir, -- it's

23

compliance with its public interest obligation.

24

of the reasons I can say, easily, why the networks and

25

the stations much prefer, under the Fairness Doctrine and
12

21

22

25

under this system, the idea of case by case adjudication
is that it is to say the least, an uncomfortable sense
to be met for the first time at license renewal time with
a series of charges to the effect that there's a violation
of the public interest standard or some other obligations.
But I can't tell you, if somebody comes in and makes a
sufficient showing of failure to abide by the public
interest obligations of the station, that that's an improper
thing for the Commission to consider; it is indeed a
proper thing for the Commission to consider.

But so far

as possible, it's best to do this on a case by case basis.
For one thing, it allows case by case curing of the prob­
lems if indeed stations are found to have violated any
obligations.
In a Fairness context, for example, it allows the
station to do something about that which it has been accused
of not serving the public about.
QUESTION:

But I gather, Mr. Abrams, you do agree

that if there's a violation of 312(a)(7) that the Commission
finds and the only sanctions it may impose are immediate
revocation or wait until license renewal time.

Are there

any other sanctions the Commission can -- impose?
MR. ABRAMS:

I don't know of any other sanctions

which the Commission can impose, I think it fair to say as
a practical matter, as I suggested to Mr. Justice White,
13

1

that the conclusion by the Commission of a violation of

2

Section 312(a)(7) which is affirmed by the Courts or not

3

appealed to the Courts, would have more than a little

4

effect on the conduct of the station involved.

5

QUESTION:

Well if the Commission, at the end of

6

its declaratory judgment it says we find that you have

7

violated the section but we don't propose now to revoke

8

your license, we'll just take it into account at some time

9

-- I take it there's never been any question that you can

10

get review in the Court of Appeals of that declaratory

11

j udgment?

12
13
14

MR. ABRAMS:

There's never been any question

about it, no sir.
QUESTION:

And the Commission doesn't claim any

15

authority to go further and -- or -- require you at a

16

particular point to sell time?

17

MR. ABRAMS:

Or does it?

I think you'd do best to ask that

18

question to my

19

knowledge has not taken that position -- what it did do in

20

this case, for example, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, was to

21

direct the networks to inform the Commission how it intended

22

to comply with Section 312(a)(7) given the conclusion of

23

the Commission that there has been a failure to comply

24
25

friend on my right.

by not selling the time on the nights
QUESTION:

The Commission to my

which it was --

But I take it that would depend on
14

1

whether Carter-Mondale still wanted the time at the time you

2

were now required to give it to them.
MR. ABRAMS:

3

It would depend, in this case, indeed

4

it did depend, Mr. Justice Brennan, because they withdrew

5

their request in light of the Iranian crisis, made a new

6

request for time which was granted by in fact, all of the

7

networks.

8
9

QUESTION:

But the case is still a live case

because, I take it, you think the Commission has -- it

10

maintains its view and that you will be in trouble with

11

them again?

12

MR. ABRAMS:

It is live in that sense, it is live

13

in the Southern Pacific sense, it is live in -- for another

14

reason, and that is that the Commission takes the position

15

in this very case with respect to these very networks that

16

there is "continuing legal and practical effect of their

17

ruling, without regard to the fact that they

18

imposed any sanctions" --

19

20
21

QUESTION:

have not

Well, as long as they are still ahead

at license renewal time the rule is there, isn't it?
MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, well it is always there and of

22

course, as I said first, it is a recurrent controversy

23

and indeed it is a peculiarly recurring controversy in the

24

context of election campaigns.

25

just last week in the Wisconsin Primary case, that's even

And as the Court suggested

15

1

a more special situation, in which parties have to have some

2

way to get to Court to have a resolution either prior to

3

election or after election, to find out what the rules of

4

the game are.

5

6

QUESTION':

individual stations --

7

MR. ABRAMS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

The statute, of course, talks about

Yes.
-- and the parties in this case are

networks, not individual stations.

Now I -- I think the

networks do own a limited number of individual stations --

11

MR. ABRAMS: Mr. Justice Stewart, we argued that

12

below, we took the position below that Section 312(a)(7)

13

does not apply to the networks because it says what it says.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes, right.
And indeed, because in the ordinary

16

case it wouldn't make sense for it to apply to the networks.

17

Our example earlier is a useful one.

18

and the Court of Appeals affirmed the proposition that it

19

did apply to networks.

20

but --

21

22

We have not pressed that point here,

QUESTION: You haven't -- that isn't one of your
points raised?

23

MR. ABRAMS:

24

QUESTION:

25

The Commission held

No sir, it is not.
But still

with

all

this discussion

with my brothers about the sanctions to be imposed, the
16

1

statute is very clear, it has no reference whatsoever to

2

networks, except insofar as they may be the owners of

3

individual stations, and I know they are, a limited number.
MR. ABRAMS:

4

That is correct, and that was the

5

view that we took, as I've indicated -- we did not press

6

that point in this Court.
QUESTION:

7

8

The networks' license could never be

revoked.
MR. ABRAMS:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ABRAMS:

The networks don't have licenses.
Yes.
Yes.

And that's -- that was one

12

of the things again, that we urged below, and I begin to be

13

sorry we didn't raise here perhaps.
QUESTION:

14
15

Do the networks have an obligation

to obey the Fairness Doctrine?
MR. ABRAMS:

16

The networks have been held by

17

Commission practice -- yes sir, to be obliged to obey the

18

Fairness Doctrine.

And I believe the networks --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ABRAMS:

21

QUESTION:

Do you question that?
No sir.
Well, individual stations do, and most,

22

many individual stations are affiliated with one network or

23

another.

24

MR. ABRAMS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
Are the statutory provisions related
17

1

to the Fairness Doctrine that apply to the networks as

2

opposed to licensees?

3

MR. ABRAMS:

There are no distinct statutory

4

provisions.

5

Section 315, it is not couched in the same language as this,

6
7

8
9
10
1 1

but the Fairness Doctrine has been -- has arisen in a
variety of cases and controversies before the Commission.
Some bought by the networks after they had lost in the
Commission itself, and we have not taken the position and do
not take the position that it cannot apply to the networks
in that sense.

12
13
14

15
16

QUESTION:

19

20
21
22
23
24

25

What happens, Mr. Abrams, as a practical

matter, between the network and the affiliated stations?
If the networks said, yes, we'll give you the hour but the
particular station said, no, we won't carry it;

are they

free to do that?

17
18

The only Fairness Doctrine requirement is in

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes sir.

Networks have no power

to require affiliated stations to carry it and can do
nothing and would do nothing to require the affiliates to
carry -QUESTION:

If half of the affiliates declined to

carry it, I suppose that would have something to do with the
cost of the time, wouldn't it?
MR. ABRAMS:

No, the cost of the time would be

arranged beforehand-- would have to do of course with the
18

but the time of this sort would

1

effect of the broadcast

2

be paid -- the amount would be paid to the network itself,

3

because the time would be purchased from the network itself.

4

there's absolutely nothing the network can do, to require,1 fo:

5

example, that these advertisements -- if they were -- if the

6

networks have to carry them, be shown in Iowa.

7

things that we said from the start to the Commission was

8

-- and to the Carter campaign -- was, that if what you're

9

thinking about is the Iowa Caucus, which is what's coming

up close, why don't you go to the Iowa stations and seek to

11

buy time.

12

And it has always been our view that a very dif­

13

ferent kind of reasonableness standards would govern a

14

request brought 47 days before the Iowa Caucus in Iowa,

15

than would occur eight months before the Democratic National

16

Convention when a nationwide broadcast is sought.

17

I would like to turn briefly to the nature of the

18

statute as we see it.

And to start out, by saying this, I

19

think it is common ground here that unless the statute sig­

20

nificantly changed the public interest standard as it

21

previously existed, we would not be here today and the

22

broadcasters would have prevailed at the Commission level.

23

I think my friends on my right would agree to that, it

24

is based on the case law, a correct proposition.

25

seems to me that the first issue for consideration by the
19

But

And so it

1

Court is whether Section 312(a)(7) in fact changed the pre­

2

existing case law, and to the extent that it is asserted

3

by the Commission.

4

the fact that this issue has to a considerable degree at

5

least, been before this Court before.

6

v. DNC case, this Court had occasion to analyze the nature

7

of broadcast regulation and to go through, at considerable

8

length, the fact that Congress had, in the Court's terms,

9

time and again rejected systems of mandatory access.

We

urge upon you, among other things,

In 1973, in the CBS

The

10

Court in the course of demonstrating that Congress had

11

rejected such systems time and again, cited to this statute

12

and referred to it as a codification of prior practice.

13

The Court had the benefit at that time of a brief

14

amicus curiae filed by the United States and the FCC,

15

urging precisely that position upon it.

16

the Court said then, and I want to emphasize that it is not

17

just the footnote which refers to Section 312(a)(7) -- that

18

we rely upon here, but the text and the theme of the Court's

19

opinion there that we rely upon.

20

then the brief of the FCC, it had before it the statute and

21

the statute was then brand new.

22

said in '73 in DNC, about this issue was correct notwith­

23

standing that has now been characterized by the Commission

24

as a decision which did not have the benefit of an inter­

25

pretation by the agency with the obligation of enforcing

it, even though there was a brief by that very agency

2

before it, and notwithstanding the fact that Judge Bazelon

4

far from what was before it and had treated the issue in

a cursory fashion.

I do not believe that is a fair state­

We believe the intent of Section 312(a)(7)
is clear and that it may be found in the single piece of
legislative history that one and all agree is the most
important piece and that is the report of the Senate
Commerce Committee which put this into the bill for the
first time.

And they could not have made clearer that

what Congress was concerned about was that in the context
of the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971, which limited campaign expenditures by all forms
of media, which was enacting a lowest unit charge pro­
vision, that Congress wanted to make sure that there would
be no diminution in the language of the Senate report in
the amount of coverage by broadcasters.

The broadcasters

would not then say we don't have to carry political adver­
tisements.

That was the purpose of the bill, was to codify

the pre-existing obligation of that sort and it was to
codify it and do more, it was to add a sanction in Section
312(a)(7), and that is precisely what it did.
21

1

What the Commission's decision does is, we

2

believe, entirely inconsistent, not only with the notion

3

of codification, but with the theory of broadcast regula­

4

tion and of political neutrality of the Commission, as

5

have known it in this country.

6

Commission's decision is the notion that this is a kind

7

of candidates' entitlement bill, that this is legislation

8

which leads, as a first question to what does the candi­

9

date want and how can we give it to him.

we

At the heart of the

What the

10

Commission has done is to say that one issue which pre­

1 1

viously had always been decided as part of the reasonable­

12

ness standard applied in the context of public interest

13

cases, that is the question of when to start selling time

14

is not a factor at all; that that is a legal objective

15

fact and that the Commission will tell us hereafter

16

when a campaign is "in full swing".

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

They have thus taken

out of the equation which used to govern the whole notion
of reasonableness any ability of the broadcasters to
factor in when, except to say, we will tell you when the
campaign is in full swing and once it is in full swing
then your legal obligations attach and then we will apply
a kind of equation of which the single most important
element is the candidate's needs.
It is the position of the Commission that we,
networks, and then they, the Commission, no less, are to
22

1

get involved in the question of what the candidate wants,

2

and to some extent at least, why he wants it.

3

Commission has tried, in the latter stages of this case,

4

to retreat from that and to say that you can take the

5

candidates' needs as expressed by them.

6

is that the opinion of the Commission and the opinion of

7

Judge Bazelon below make very clear that what we are then

8

allowed to say, what we are almost obliged to say as

9

networks, is something like this:

10

12
13

Now the

But the problem

a candidate says he

wants two hours to do a program on foreign policy, to
express his views.

We are then to look and see if he can

do that, a foreign policy speech, in something less than
two hours and we are supposed to get back to the candidate,
make a judgment, get back to the Commission, have a federal
agency no less, rule on the question of our reasonableness
in

telling that candidate that two hours is longer than

he needs to make a speech.
I wish to refer the Court to one of the cases
cited in our brief, the Ed Clark case, a recent opinion

20

after the promulgation of the Carter-Mondale case, where

21

NBC -- from my personal knowledge -- was put in the position

22
23
24
25

where a third-party candidate for the Libertarian party
was saying I want 25-minute segments and NBC, trying to
comply with this new ruling which we come to you today to
seek to get reversed, was put in the position of saying
23

1

7

8
9
10

we think 5 five-minute segments, plus a series of shorter
segments, 30-second segments, et cetera, can accomplish
your stated ends of greater voter identification and raising
money.

We never should have been in that position; the

Commission surely should never have been put in the position
of judging the reasonableness, and in that case, it said
NBC was reasonable in saying that back to Ed Clark.

That

imports the Commission into the political process in a
way it has never been before and we think that it raises
the most significant constitutional questions as well.

11

If I may, I would like to reserve what little

12

time I have left for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
16

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

17

may it please the Court:
18

The government's submission in this case has two
19

principal parts.

First, we contend that Section 312(a)(7)

20

imposed a new obligation on broadcasters to afford reason­
21

able access to individual candidates for federal elective
22

office.

Second, we contend that the Commission properly

23

found that Petitioners failed to afford reasonable access
24

on the facts of this particular case.
25

each of these points in turn.
24

I'd like to take up

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, may I ask you first, why

2

did the Commission go after the networks rather than

3

stations,

4

since networks aren’t licensed?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The networks are the sole owners

5

and operators of five licensed television stations in.

6

the biggest television markets in the country.

7

broadcast stations, the Commission has always viewed them

8

as such prior to the enactment of this statute, and it

9

continues to view them as broadcast stations that do own

10

licensed television stations.

1 1

QUESTION:

12
13

They are

So --

It would be only the licenses of those pa?

ticular stations that would be subject to revocation?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Only the licenses of those stations

14

could be revoked; the Commission has not yet determined

15

whether cease and desist orders, in addition to revocation,

16

could supplement its remedies in this area.

17
18
19

20
21

That's a

possibility as well.
QUESTION:

Nor has it been determined whether

if it did use cease and desist orders, whether the statute
would authorize it.
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct.

The Commission hasn't

passed on the available arsenal of remedies, because it
has not yet had occasion to impose sanctions on any station
in the last eight years.

The question of remedy hasn't

arisen yet.

QUESTION:

At some time, Mr. Shapiro, as you

develop this discussion of the new obligation, as you call
it, would you suggest hypothetically what would be the
situation if some of the committees -- and we read in the
paper that there are activities already developing right
in Washington for 1984 -- if some of these committees made
requests now for 15 minutes or 30 minutes, for May or July
of this year, or a year from now -- in other words, at
what point is the Commission authorized to say when the
campaign begins?
MR. SHAPIRO:

At these early stages, I'm quite

sure that the Commission would conclude that the Presidential
campaign for 1984 is not yet in full swing.

It looks to

a complex of factors; the nearness of the primaries and the
conventions and caucuses in the several states, the number
of candidates who have announced their intention to seek the
presidency, the existence of nationwide campaign activities
and campaign organizations -- it looks to a whole series
of such factors.
QUESTION:

By the statute there has to be

a legally qualified candidate, whatever that means.
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

There is none now, for 1984.

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's quite true.

To be legally

qualified, the candidate has to have, to be on the ballot
26

1

in ten different states for the forthcoming primaries

2

and to have announced his intention to seek the presidency,

3

so at this early stage you wouldn't even have a legally

4

qualified candidate.

5

QUESTION:

That's why I emphasized hypothetically.

6

When does this begin after he is a qualified candidate,

7

after someone is a qualified candidate, and what is the

8

specific source of authority in the statute for the

9

Commission to fix that date?

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

The source of authority in the

1 1

Commission's view, is in the statutory

12

reasonable access be afforded.

13

prets the term "reasonable access" to have a time component

14

as well as an amount component.

15

explicit statutory authority to prescribe conditions that

16

give effect to other provisions in the statute.

Do you think the statute would author­

ize the Commission to, at some point in the process, just

21

to announce that the campaign has now begun, without pur­

24
25

porting to

sit

in review of a network's judgment as to

when the campaign has begun?
MR. SHAPIRO:

We believe that it would have that

authority, but it hasn't purported to proceed on that basis.
27

1

It waits for complaints to be filed and then determines

2

if the campaign is in full swing, if it's found to be in

full swing it then considers whether or not the denial of

air time has been reasonable.

QUESTION:

only to Presidential elections, but to any federal elective
office, doesn't it?

That's quite true.

Congressional races and Senatorial

races ?

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's right.

That's right.

Yes, Your Honor.

Any problems arisen under it in connec­

tion with such races yet?

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

The statute has worked remarkably

15

well, even with respect to these races for a seat in

16

Congress.

17

resolve these questions on their own; there have only been

18

37 rulings under the statute in the last eight years.

19

considering the fact that there have been 2500 races for

20

federal elective office in that period and there are almost

21

10,000 broadcasters are subject to this provision -- that's

22

a remarkably small number of interventions in the particular

23

cases .

24
25

Principally because the parties negotiate,

QUESTION:

And

Aren't the economic factors a natural

damper on these early requests?
28

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's quite true, Your Honor.

2

The cost of this segment of time was $186,000 on CBS.

3

There's a natural pressure not to make early requests or

4

to make unduly large requests for time.

5

6

QUESTION:

Quite expensive.

Mr. Shapiro, how many of these 37

rulings were before this ruling and how many after it?

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

In our brief in opposition we note th at

of them have come afterwards and all of those were

preceded the Carter-Mondale ruling here.
QUESTION:

At

the time of the Carter-Mondale

ruling, was that the ticket on the ballot in ten states?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

They made that demonstration

before the Commission, that they had substantial bona fide
campaign activities in ten or more states; that's an
alternative in addition to being on the ballot.

And I

believe that's the route they use to show bona fide candi­
dacy, was existence of substantial campaigning in ten
different states.
QUESTION:

That's their definition of a legally

qualified candidate?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's one component.

There are

three requirements that are set forth in the Commission's
regulations.

And one of them is, a specified amount of

activity in ten different states, or placement on the primary
29

ballot in ten different states.
QUESTION:

Is there anything to prevent a network

from selling time next week to a 1984 candidate?
MR. SHAPIRO:

If it chooses to do so, it's per­

fectly free to negotiate and that's the --

6

QUESTION:

If he has $186,000 for a half hour?

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's right.

Parties are always

8

free to strike whatever bargain they wish to, and that's the

9

Commission's expectation in this area:

that its guidelines

10

and rules will facilitate private negotiations and mini­

11

mize the need for the government to get into the process.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Well, I take it you're going to tell

us how (a)(7) changes the law?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

The networks,

15

of course, argue that this Section imposed no new duty,

16

that it simply codified the previously existing public

17

interest standard.

18

QUESTION:

And do you agree that if it hadn't impos4d

19

a new duty, the Commission's order in this case would have

20

been infirm?

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well that's quite true.

Under the

22

old public interest policy, no individual candidate had

23

a right of affirmative access.

24

relief from the Commission no matter how many times he was

25

denied access.

He could not obtain any

It guaranteed no reasonable access or
30

1

2
3
4
5

6
7

8
9

indeed, any access, to the individual candidate.

It

required only some political programming during the threeyear term of the license.

The broadcaster was at liberty

to pick and choose among the campaigns and decide which
were the most important and which it would sell time to,
and which it would not sell time to.

For example, the

broadcaster could determine that the campaign for governor
in a particular year was more important than the campaign
for a seat in the House of Representatives, and withhold

10

time from all of the candidates in the Congressional race.
1 1

One need only compare this amorphous obligation with the
12

very specific obligation imposed by the new statute to
13

see that Congress was embarking on a new course.
14

Under this statute, 312(a)(7), Congress has
15

empowered the Commission to impose sanctions based on a
16

broadcaster's repeated or willful failure to sell reasonable
17

amounts of air time.to an individual federal candidate.

The

18

words chosen by Congress focus in squarely on the individ­
19

ual:

a legally qualified candidate must be afforded the

20

specific use of a broadcast station to advocate his candi­
21

dacy.

Under the statute, the broadcaster exposes himself

22

to the ultimate sanction of license revocation if he
23

unreasonably withholds air time on two or more occasions, or
24

if he does this willfully on even one occasion.

In short,

25

as the Commission and the Court of Appeals both agreed,
31

1

this statute extends its protection to the individual fed­

2

eral candidate, a kind of protection that was wholly

3

unknown under the predecessor public interest standard.

4

In this connection the Court may reasonably ask

5

why, if Congress really meant to codify the public interest

6

standard why didn't it refer to the elements of the public

7

interest standard?

8

should review state and federal campaigns, should pick out

9

the most important ones, should give air time to some of

Why didn't it say that the broadcasters

10

them and withhold air time from the others.

1 1

of the public interest policy are simply not the elements

12

prescribed by Congress in 312(a)(7).

13

These elements

And the legislative history of this provision

14

far from contradicting its plain meaning, strongly supports

15

the literal interpretation that the Commission has given.

16

Section 312(a)(7) was a central part of

17

Federal Election Campaign Act.

18

Senate Commerce Committee, had two and only two purposes:

19

it's first purpose was to give candidates, and I quote,

20

"greater access to the media, so that they may better

21

explain their stand on the issues and thereby more fully

22

and completely inform the voters. " It's second purpose was

23

to halt the spiraling cost of campaigning.

24

312(a)(7) doesn't have any direct relationship to the goal

25

of containing campaign costs, but it does have a direct

But when Congress enacted Section 312(a)(7)

it recognized that this unqualified statement was no longer
correct; it was necessary for Congress to make what it
called conforming amendment, to bring Section 315 into
harmony with the newly enacted 312(a)(7).
As amended, Section 315 now provides no obligation
is imposed under this subsection on any licensee to allow
the use of its station by any such candidate.

QUESTION:

And did that come out of the Conference

Committee?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That came out of the Conference

Committee, that's correct, Your Honor.

And it was necessary

for Congress to qualify its statement that there was no
duty to give affirmative access to individual candidates
33

1

and to make it quite clear that that statement applied

2

only under Section 315, precisely because the newly enacted

3

Section 312(a)(7) does obligate broadcasters to afford

4

affirmative access to individual candidates.

5

QUESTION:

Well even if you are right in everything

you've said so far, the duty is only to allow reasonable

Congress and.the federal election law and other ways has shown
a concern about the mounting costs of campaigns and the

length of campaigns, does that fit into the equation along

2

with a judgment as to whether the public -- there's enough

3

public interest, say?
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

In our view, Congress did not intend

5

that the networks deny or cut back requests for air time

6

from candidates on the view that this was too costly or

7

that it was contributing to mounting campaign costs .

one reason --

In that case, the vice in the access scheme was that

it had no Congressional sanction, whereas in this case

2

Congress has prescribed a specific access scheme for a

narrowly defined class of candidates, federal candidates

for office.

And in fact, the statute contained a provision

that the Court evolved on an ad hoc basis.
QUESTION:

Well Mr. Shapiro, you think the

12

Commission in this case, in deciding there had been a

13

violation, asked the question was it reasonable for the

14

networks to decide that the campaign hadn't begun?

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

The Commission takes the position

16

that in that area it will make its own judgment about

17

whether the campaign is --

18

QUESTION:

So you -- I thought just a while ago

19

you talked -- I thought you agreed a moment ago that the

20

Commission should -- it should determine whether the net­

21

works judgment about when the campaign had begun was

22

reasonable.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is an area where the Commission

24

has said there is lesser discretion in deciding when the

25

campaign begins, it said it will listen to the positions
38

1

of the networks -- and the candidates, and make its own

2

j udgment.
QUESTION:

3

Well yes, but -- doesn't it nevertheless

4

have to conclude that the network made an unreasonable

5

decision?

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, and it did just that, in light

7

of an abundance of evidence showing that the campaign was

8

in full swing in November --

9

QUESTION:

Well, but it does that in a sense that

10

we're describing -- we're just going to decide for ourselves

11

when it begins, as a matter of objective fact, and if the

12

network chose a different date it was just wrong.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

If the evidence is against the

14

network, that's correct.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, was the so-called conform­

23

ing amendment to Section 315 contained in the same statute

24

at large as the 312(a)(7)?

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor it was.
39

And it was

1

a sentence or two removed from 312(a)(7).

2

The Commission might have interpreted the statute

3

to require the offer of fixed quantities of time under a

4

particular time schedule to try to mitigate some of the

5

complexities that we’re talking about, under highly specific

6

rules. And it sought the views of the networks on this kind

7

of a proposal in 1978.

8

kind of an approach, urging the Commission to continue to

10

The networks vehemently opposed this

of their conduct on an ad hoc basis, or a case-by-case basis.

1 1

In its comments to the Commission at that time,

12

NBC stressed the importance of individual treatment.

13

stated in its brief, a copy of which I have lodged with the

14

Court yesterday, and I quote, "different candidates have

15

different campaign strategies.

30-minute programs of prime time, another may want 10-

17

second spots during fringe programming.

18

exposure

19

We believe it would be most difficult for the Commission

20

to promulgate any rule that could take all of these

21

diverse strategies and campaign needs into account."

22

around

It

One will concentrate on

A third will seek

news and public affairs programming.

The Commission essentially agreed with that

23

assessment.

24

general guidelines under Congress' rule of reason, to

25

facilitate individual negotiations.

It concluded that It would be best to adopt

40

And to minimize the

1

need for governmental intervention.

2

of course, is that broadcasters need not extend any access

3

even if the federal candidate is legally qualified, unless

4

the campaign is fully underway as evidenced by objective

5

facts that we've been discussing.

6

that once the campaign begins, broadcasters may not enforce

7

across the board or blanket policies in rejecting requests

8

for time.

9

to accomodate --

The second guideline

is

They must be willing to negotiate and attempt

QUESTION:

10

One of the guidelines

If you could just stop there for a

11

moment, Mr. Shapiro.

Why is a blanket rule -- say we don't

12

want anything for two weeks or three weeks, necessarily

13

arbitrary?

14

reasonableness in saying even though the campaign has

15

begun, we think in terms of interest and orderly programming,

16

and not getting too many obligations too soon, we'd rather

17

wait till -- for 30 days.

It seems to me there is a certain element of

18

Why is it necessarily unreasonable --

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

I can't state it any better than

20

NBC did in the passage that I just quoted.

21

campaign strategies that the candidates pursue are vitally

22

important to communicating their own message, and to adopt

23

a simple rule that only five-minute spots will be allowed

24

or you won't allow access in the month of December, that can

25

interfere fundamentally with the strategy of a particular
41

The different

1

candidate.
QUESTION:

2

Well it may

not give the man the

3

strategy he wants but does it necessarily violate either

4

the requirement of reasonable amounts of time or reasonable

5

access ?

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

7

QUESTION:

8

Those are the two requirements that

the networks must meet.
MR. SHAPIRO:

9
10

Well --

It's the Commission's duty to

interpret the reasonable access standard and in its view -QUESTION:

1 1

Well, you would agree it doesn't

12

necessarily violate the reasonable amount of time require­

13

ment ?

14

15
16
17
18

MR. SHAPIRO:

No.

It's the reasonable access

requirement -QUESTION:

Reasonable access.

And the reasonable

access must always reflect what the candidate wants?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Balanced against the legitimate

19

concerns of the broadcasters.

20

that there really are two interests here that have to be

21

weighed; reasonableness looks both ways, to the candidate

22

and to the broadcaster --

23

QUESTION:

The Commission has concluded

Well as I understand your point earlier,

24

it didn't look both ways, it said there's kind of a flat

25

ban against flat bans.
42

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

It said that it is improper not

2

to weigh the needs of the particular candidate and the

3

particular case, but you also must weigh the legitimate

4

concerns of the broadcaster in the same balancing process;

5

that is, multiplicity of candidates or program disruption.

6

And this is the kind of accomodation of both of the

7

interests that the Commission believes best strikes the

8

balance of reasonableness under the statute.

9

QUESTION:

But after weighing those,

it did

10

come up with at least one per se rule, and that is that any

1 1

broadcaster's blanket refusal to sell any time to any

12
13

qualified candidate, even after the campaign had begun
during a certain period was, per se, unreasonable.

14

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct.

It's necessary

to weigh --

16

QUESTION:

A broadcaster might say this is the

17

Christmas season and we have our own programming and we

18

don't want to accept anything until after the first of the

19

year.

20
21

22
23
24

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct.

It's necessary to

weigh the individual request.
QUESTION:

But there is no, ever, after the weigh­

ing process was over they came up with this per se rule,
didn't they?

The Commission did.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well no, the per se rule means that

7

not demonstrated that this approach is patently irrational

8

or that it conflicts with any provision of the Communications

9

Act.

10

And the networks expend a great deal of time

QUESTION:

Well that's turning the thing upside

1 1

down, isn't it?

12

give reasonable access and they, in the first instance

13

decide what's reasonable?

14
15

It's a reasonable -- the networks have to

And the Commission

reviews

that to

see if it really is within the bounds of discretion and

16

one of the standards that it has prescribed to make the

17

process conform in its view with the statutory requirement

18

is that no blanket rules may be prescribed.

19

question for a reveiwing court is whether it's patently

20

irrational, arbitrary or capricious for the Commission to

21

adopt this approach, and we submit that it isn't.

22

QUESTION:.

And the

So that, I take it then, you seriously

23

contend that Congress intended that the Commission play a

24

very central role, as a broker, in political campaigns in

25

deciding access to television?
44

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's precisely the role Congress

2

has given the Commission, to sit as umpire in cases of

3

disagreement over reasonable access issues --

4

5

QUESTION:

And in deciding what the needs of

candidates are and --

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

7

QUESTION:

Not deciding what their needs are.

Well, you just said they had to -- they

8

must take account of what the candidate's style is, of what

9

their approach is and what their needs are.

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

1 1

QUESTION: That the Commission, if it disagrees --

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

13

QUESTION:

The Commission's only review --

-- with respect to that issue --

-- with the -- I take it, from what

14

you say, that if the Commission disagrees with the networks'

15

judgment about what the needs of the candidate are, they

16

haven't given him reasonable access?

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

No sir.

It's only role in review­

18

ing is to determine if the -- if the networks have considered

19

the request on an individual basis, and if so, if they have

20

weighed it against the factors that the Commission has

21

specified as counterveiling factors -- if the networks have

22

done that, they are home free.

23

QUESTION:

There's no violation.

Mr. Shapiro, in the Court of Appeals

24

opinion 4(a) of the Appendix, the Court of Appeals says that

25

-- describing the Commission proceeding, it ordered the
45

1

2
3

networks to comply with the requirements of the Act.

Now

w hat would have been the sanction had the networks not have
complied with the orders of --

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

The sanction that's

expressly

5

prescribed is revocation of broadcast license, and each

6

of these networks is a licensee of five VHF television

7

stations.

8

to revocation there is a cease and desist remedy, cease and

9

desist order that's available, but that hasn't been liti­

10

gated .

11
12

The Commission staff believes that in addition

QUESTION:

Well, could It, right then , revoke

the license?

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

14

or willful misconduct.

15

for appellate review and the Commission had entered the

16

order that it did and the networks continued to withhold

17

access, at that point, arguably you would have willful mis­

18

conduct.

19

misconduct.

20

The statute requires either repeated
Now, if there had been no petition

But it requires either willfulness or repetitive

QUESTION:

Well doesn't a complaint have to

21

allege a willful violation, even to energize the Commission?

22

I mean, the statute says repeated or. willful -- no question

23

here, there wasn't any question about repeated refusal, was

24

there?

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

No.

But it's essential that the
46

1

Commission adjudicate a specific complaint such as this

2

to see if in the future there is in fact a pattern of

3

repetition.

That's why the Commission takes the first case.

QUESTION:

4

You mean the Commission will take a

5

case if a claimant says this hasn't been repeated yet, this i 3 the

6

initial instance

7

they are in perfectly good faith, they just haven't

8

interpreted -- you mean the Commission would get underway

9

right then?

and as far as I know, it isn't willful,

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

It would determine if there was --

Not even a

claim

That's correct.

of willfulness?
It would determine

13

if there was an unreasonable withholding, and then if there

14

was a second such adjudication, that would lead to the

15

imposition of sanctions under the statute.

16

determine the first-QUESTION:

17

But it doesn't

Can you adjudicate the very first --

18

suppose there's no claim of willfulness, and the Commission

19

isn't looking for willfulness, the Commission will take on

20

the very first refusal because it may be -- it will be

21

repeated?

22
23
24

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

Precisely.

And the broadcasters

have urged the Commission to do just that.
QUESTION:

Well from what I've read and heard

here today, I understand that the broadcaseters welcome

47

1

this position.
MR. SHAPIRO:

2

They welcome this because it prevents

3

a pattern of misconduct from turning into something that

4

later would result in revocation.

5

why they urged us to follow this approach.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

8

And that's precisely

Would you -And the Courts of Appeals have

approved that approach.

9

QUESTION:

Would you agree that the decision on

10

the part of the network could be erroneous, but -- in a

11

particular case, but still within the bounds of reason­

12

ableness?

13

Or are they mutually exclusive?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well in -- the Commission has divided

14

up the issues, on the question of whether the campaign has

15

started it

16

on the question whether the broadcaster has balanced the

17

individual interest against the broadcaster's own counter­

18

veiling interests, in this area, they will not intrude unless

19

the decision is clearly erroneous, whether it's an abuse

20

of discretion --

21

makes its own independent determination.

QUESTION:

22

in the statute?

23

to Rule 52(a).

24

25

But

Where do you get the "clearly erroneous"

Clearly, now you're equating it something
Where do you get the clearly, the adjective?

MR. SHAPIRO:

This is the Commission's interpreta­

tion of the reasonable access requirement and it was

would otherwise exist if the Commission determined that

ORAL REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ABRAMS:

I'd just like to point out to the

1 1

Court if I may that the plain meaning of this statute has

12

never been as plain to the Commission as it is today.

13

have issued reports in 1972, 1974, a primer in 1978, none

14

of which talked about this being a candidate's needs statute.

15

This matter of the Commission determining when as an objective

16

matter the campaign began did not come to the Commission's

17

mind until its second opinion in this case.

18

first opinion they purported to say that the networks had

19

acted unreasonably in deciding when the campaign began.

20

was not until page 124(a) of the appendix to the petition

21

where the Commission, in its second opinion on rehearing,

22

says in so many words that its determination was based on

23

its own independent evaluation of the status of the campaign.

24
25

They

In it's very

It

Mr. Shapiro refers to Title I and its purposes and
I can do no: more than to refer the Court to the briefs on

1

that.

2

media access was to be expanded, it did not include and

3

the Commission's opinion says this, Section 3.12(a)(7) as

4

one means by which that expansion would occur.

5

And finally, a word on blanket rule.

Title I of the statute said, in so many words, how

I don't even

6

understand why it is a blanket rule for ABC to say in

7

December we think it's appropriate for us to start selling

8

time in January.

9

detaching the issue of when from factors that the networks

It is only by the Commission's process of

10

may consider and be judged on, in some reasonable way,

11

and by getting that out of the equation entirely, that it

12

makes it a blanket policy.

13

it "unreasonable" because that's not a subject in which the

14

networks have anything to say at all anymore.

15

QUESTION:

That it's only that that makes

Do you agree, Mr. Abrams, that they

16

-- that this process of undertaking these cases where there

17

is no claim of repeated violations, no claim of a willful

18

violation; only a claim of an unreasonable one and go at

19

it the very first time around?

20

21

MR. ABRAMS:

Justice

White, and there was a cliam here of willful misconduct --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. ABRAMS:

24

25

Well, there's a claim, Mr.

QUESTION:

Yes, but there was never a claim --- the Commission -Oh was there a claim of willful mis­

conduct?
50

1

2

MR. ABRAMS:
that was so --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ABRAMS:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

The Carter-Mondale campaign said

So you think --- and we think --- they ought to actually claim

a -- a willful misconduct?
MR. ABRAMS:

A claim was made, I don't think the

8

Commission had any option but to rule on it at the time and

9

in the way that they did.

10

QUESTION:

But I gathered Mr. Shapiro indicated

1 1

that they would undertake these adjudications even if there's

12

no claim of -- either of repeated or willful misconduct?

13

MR. ABRAMS:

My impression, Mr. Justice White,

14

and I must say it is that, is that parties have come to

15

characterize their claims in this area within the statutory

16

language and so they say, at least when they file complaints,

17

that it is willful or --

18
19

20

QUESTION:
what they are doing?

Willful in the sense -- surely they know
Not unconscious.

MR. ABRAMS: In terms of the broadcasters, I mean

21

the worst thing of all would be to be confronted with a situ­

22

ation where the only punishment is capital punishment, li­

23

cense revocation, and the first time it comes up is at the

24

moment that your license is up for consideration.

25

QUESTION:

Presumably if they moved to revoke the
51

1

license, there would be a hearing process, I take it?

2

MR. ABRAMS:

3

QUESTION:

I certainly trust so, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Abrams, before you sit down, I'd

4

like to ask you just one question if I may.

Your position

5

is that the amendment made no change in the statute, merely

6

codified it, the pre-existing law.

7

that under pre-existing law, under the public interest stan­

8

dard you could have excluded entirely coverage for certain

9

minor campaigns, for example, but that now you could not do

And Mr. Shapiro suggests

10

that because of the legally qualified candidate language.

11

How do you respond to that argument?

12

MR. ABRAMS:

We don't believe that we could have

13

refrained, under the public interest standard as it exists,

14

from making any use time available, say, in this Presiden­

15

tial campaign or in this Presidential primary —

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ABRAMS:

No, he's talking about other campaigns.
Oh, in other federal races like that?

18

It -- this would be a different situation perhaps , if there

19

was a lower federal category than races for Congress, but

20

that is not the case.

21

standing that the public interest standard would not have

22

permitted a flat policy on behalf of a broadcaster of

23

declining to sell time totally to federal candidates.

24

so to that extent as well, we think it is a codification.

25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And it has always been our under­
