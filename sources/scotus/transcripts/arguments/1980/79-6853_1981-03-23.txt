the Court:
This cases arises on a writ of certiorari to the

Georgia Supreme Court.

11

whether full faith and credit should be applied to custody

12

decrees in the abstract but rather whether a decree which

13

meets all requirements for the application of full faith and

14

credit was properly denied such full' faith and credit simply

15

because of its nature as a custody decree.

Ms. Carden, before you go on?
Yes, Your Honor.
How are you here?
Pardon?
How did you get here?

Did you raise

these federal questions below?
MS. CARDEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The first time the

23

federal question was raised was in the motion to dismiss in

24

the trial court in Berrien County, Georgia.

25

requested that the court afford full faith and credit to a

final Florida judgment rendered just days before.

QUESTION:

3

MS. CARDEN:

Did you cite the Federal Constitution?
No, we did not cite the Federal Con­

4

stitution although we felt and we continue to feel that full

5

faith and credit is such a clear issue, there is no reference

6

to it in the Georgia Constitution or any other statute, and

7

since it was implicit that we were referring to the U. S.

8

Constitution, that that was not necessary.

9

I think it's clear from the finding of the Georgia Supreme

And it was clear,

10

Court, and of course we did raise it in our enumerations of

1 1

error on appeal.

12

13

QUESTION:

Well, the Georgia Supreme Court didn't

say a word about full faith and credit?

14

MS. CARDEN:

No, they didn't say a word about full

15

faith and credit although they held that the Florida decree

16

was a final decree and then continued on to say, nevertheless,

17

it had no effect in preempting jurisdiction of the Georgia

18

courts.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

And you regard that as a disposition of

the full faith and credit argument?
MS. CARDEN:

Yes, Your Honor, we feel that that

22

completely disposes of the full faith and credit issue since

23

they ignored the --

QUESTION:

Now, you started to say that you raised

it in your -- ?

MS. CARDEN:

1

2

Yes, we raised it in our enumerations

of error to the Georgia Supreme Court.

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. CARDEN:

And what form did that take?
We requested that the trial court be

5

found in error for failing to accord full faith and credit

6

to the Florida decree.

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. CARDEN:

9

QUESTION:

Again any reference to the Constitution?
No, Your Honor.
Doesn't the Georgia Supreme Court rules

10

of practice require that any assignment of error that's not

1 1

supported by argument or case citation shall be deemed aban­

12

doned?

13

MS. CARDEN:

There are some very specific rules to

which I think the respondent was referring to that do

15

with the raising of constitutional issues and the attack under

16

the constitutionality of the statute.

17

the case here.

18

you must argue your issues in your brief.

19

entire brief was based on the full faith and credit issues,

20

and although there were various state Issues involved that

the whole tenor of the brief was obviously a full faith and

credit issue brief.

Court in the record somewhere?

I thought one of your major points was

Below, Your Honor, we argued that --

6

and

to this in more detail -- that the Uniform

7

Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, which was applicable in both

8

Florida and Georgia, also prohibited the Georgia court from

9

assuming jurisdiction, but that was an independent ground from

10

full faith and credit, because the Uniform Child Custody

11

Jurisdiction Act is only --

12

QUESTION:

You didn't have a separate section in

13

your brief in the Georgia Supreme Court arguing full faith

14

and credit?

15

MS. CARDEN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. CARDEN:

No, we didn't, Your Honor.
You just argued the statutory question.
We argued that on the basis of the

18

Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, but also on the basis

19

of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, that the trial court was

20

in error.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Did you cite the Full Faith and Credit

Clause of the United States Constitution in your brief?
MS. CARDEN:

No, we did not, Your Honor.

We felt

24

that unlike due process and some other more nebulous terms th4t

25

may be found in numerous statutes'and

the state constitution,

there was no question as to our reference to the full faith

Mr. and Mrs. Webb were divorced in the Superior Court of

Some 15 months later, in

11

February of 1979, she took a two-day vacation to Miami leaving

12

the minor child, according to her testimony, in the care of

13

her next door neighbor, who was also her cousin.
During that two-day absence the respondent came to

the State of Florida and removed the minor child from the

State of Florida.

How did the Florida authorities get into

the act in that interim?
MS. CARDEN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. CARDEN:

What's there left to fight over?
Well, the respondent has specifically

18

refused to agree to any kind of permanent custody disposition

19

or modification.

20

21

QUESTION:

But he's turned the child back to the

mother?

22

MS. CARDEN: That's correct, but he still --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Has he indicated that he wants the child

back, ever?
MS. CARDEN:

He has refused to agree to any

modification of custody or to give any written agreement

2

which would give any kind of permanence to this relationship.

Of course, that he still has legal custody and would be able

to make his claim on the child at any time.

QUESTION:

9

Ms. Carden, in the absence of a viola­

10

tion of the Full Faith and Credit Clause in a case like this,

1 1

there's no federal question for this court to consider, is

12

there?

13

MS, CARDEN:

That's correct.

Our sole issue is

14

whether or not this particular judgment of the Florida court

15

was entitled to full faith and credit.

16

After finding that the respondent had removed the

17

minor child, the mother contacted local counsel and filed an

18

action in the State of Florida seeking the return of the

19

minor child, and also seeking a restraining order.

20

straining order after an ex parte hearing was granted to the

21

mother on the date of filing in March, 1979, and specifically

ordered the father to return the child to the State of Florida

QUESTION:

Well, what is the real controversy that's

remaining, as Mr. Justice Brennan suggested to you?
MS, CARDEN:

Well, of course, the legal custody of

the child still remains.
QUESTION:

You want us to set aside the Florida

decree, I1take it?
MS. CARDEN:

Yes, Your Honor, that is our -- for

24

Mrs. Webb to now regain custody she would have to seek a modi­

at this time.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, why not wait until that contro­

versy arises?

has every right to go to the State of Florida to remove that

we are in a very precarious position,

He would even be able to seek the assistance of law

QUESTION:

10
11

Can he do that under the new federal

statute?
MS. CARDEN:

Kidnapping Prevention Act, from everything I can determine

is not effective until July 1, 1981.

problems.

would have been on

After the respondent did not answer in the Florida
proceeding, and after he had commenced his proceeding in
11

1

Georgia, the Florida court did hold a full hearing on the

2

issue, even though he was in default.

3

they entertained the testimony of the petitioner and made

4

the following determinations.
(1)

5

And at that hearing

They determined that Florida had subject matter

6

jurisdiction in that the petitioner and the minor child were

7

residents of the State of Florida and that the minor child's

8

absence from the State of Florida did not affect his status

9

as resident of that state.
Secondly, they found that they would recognize the

10
1 1

Georgia decree and would establish this decree in the State

12

of Florida.

13

that's all they did.

14

otherwise.

15

And according to respondent and the amicus curiae
But of ■course the record indicates

The court went on and found that it was in the best

16

interest of the child to modify visitation, not just parrot­

17

ing the petitioner's request for modification of visitation,

18

but setting out a full schedule of visitation which really

19

did in no way decrease the respondent's visitation rights.

20

And lastly, and really most importantly, the

21

Florida court reviewed the other provisions of the Georgia

22

decree that were in force at that time and determined that

23

there was no reason to change any of those provisions, that

24

they should remain in full force and effect.

25

one of those, the major one of those, was that the custody
12

And,of course,

1

2

remained with the petitioner.
After the Florida judgment was rendered, the peti­

3

tioner filed an answer with the Georgia court, or amended the

4

answer she had already filed with the Georgia court and in­

5

formed the Georgia court that the Florida court had already

6

rendered a final judgment and requested in her motion to dis­

7

miss that, as we have indicated earlier, that the Florida

8

judgment be afforded full faith and credit in Georgia.

9

The Georgia court, nevertheless,

held o'hearing on

10

the matter'and as I indicated earlier, restricted the testi­

1 1

mony to the testimony of the petitioner and the respondent.

12

After hearing the testimony of the petitioner and the

13

respondent, it entered a final order completely in favor of

14

the respondent, awarding him custody of the minor child.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

When did the mother first acquaint the

Georgia court with the action in Florida?
MS. CARDEN:

She filed her answer in March, 1979,

18

and also at that time filed a motion to dismiss, and she

19

informed the court at that time that there was a pending pro­

20

ceeding in Florida.

21

QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

Had anything occurred in the Georgia

proceeding up to that time?
MS. CARDEN:

No; no.

The first thing that occurred

in the Georgia proceeding after the filing on March 24 -QUESTION:

You mentioned earlier that the father
13

1

had brought this proceeding in Georgia without informing the

2

Georgia court of the pendency of the Florida proceeding, but

3

as I now understand it that was of no significance.

4

MS. CARDEN:

5

made that disclosure.
QUESTION:

6

No, except to indicate that he had not

Because, right after the completion of

7

the Florida proceeding you then filed an answer which fully

8

acquainted

9

pened in Florida?

10

the Georgia court with everything that had hap­

MS. CARDEN:

We had filed an answer previously,

1 1

but, of course, all we could alert the court to was that

12

there was a pending Florida proceeding and ask them to decline

13

jurisdiction and allow Florida to decide the entire matter.

14

Then, after the final judgment was rendered, we amended that

15

answer, informing them of the final judgment, and at that

16

time requesting that it be accorded full faith and credit.

17

In the Georgia court order it did not mention what­

18

soever the Florida proceeding or the Florida judgment.

19

was no ruling whatsoever as to the significance of either

20

and it also found a material change of circumstances justi­

21

fying its change of custody based on events all of which had

22

occurred months and even, in several cases, a year and a half

23

prior to the rendition of the Florida order.

24
25

There

From the order of the Superior Court of Berrien
County we did appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court and
14

1

enumerate this error and failure of the Georgia trial court

2

to give full faith and credit to this Florida decree.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Carden, can you tell me why the

4

Georgia Supreme Court didn't mention the words "full faith

5

or credit"? Either one of those words?

6

MS. CARDEN:

I presume they thought that they

7

didn't have to reach that issue because of the state grounds

8

that they dealt with, but they did find that it was a final

9

judgment of the State of Florida, and then they turned around

10

in the next few sentences and said that that had no effect,

1 1

or did not preempt jurisdiction.

12

QUESTION:

No, it started off by saying that the

13

case was there "on the certain provision of Georgia's Uniform

14

Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, Code Annotated 74501."

15

That's the first sentence of it.

16
17
18
19

20

MS. CARDEN:

One of my enumerations of error was

that the Georgia court just declined -QUESTION:

Well, why did they just ignore it?

My

question is, why did they ignore it?
MS. CARDEN:

I presume, Your Honor, that they

21

thought they could make a decision on that ground alone and

22

not deal with the full faith and credit issue.

23

of our enumerations of error.

24

QUESTION:

25

That was one

Did you say, full faith and credit of

the U.S. Constitution in your brief?
15

MS. CARDEN: No,- we referred to the failure of the’trial

1

2

Court to give full faith and credit to a final Florida judgment.
QUESTION:

3
4

provisions ?
MS. CARDEN:

5

6

You didn't cite any constitutional

No, we didn't cite any constitutional

provisions.
QUESTION:

7

So you want us to say you don't have to

8

cite the Constitution in order to invoke this Court's limited

9

j urisdiction?
MS. CARDEN:

10

Your Honor, in many cases I think the

11

failure to cite the U.S. Constitution would lead to confusing

12

results,

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

I'm eagerly waiting for you to give me

the citation.
MS. CARDEN:

Well, in the cases dealing with due

process, for instance, this Court has held that --

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. CARDEN:

What case?
In cases dealing with due process this

19

Court has held that a failure to specify which provision of

20

the Constitution --

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. CARDEN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. CARDEN:

25

One of the cases -- you cite it.
Pardon?
Please cite me one case that says that.
That the failure to give the exact prov

s ion'of the United States Constitution doesn't sufficiently raise
16

1

a federal issue?

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. CARDEN:

Yes, ma’am.
Well, I can cite to you cases which

4

have held that if it is explicit in the entire record that

5

the issue was appropriately raised, then this Court can decide:

6

the federal claim.
QUESTION: Was this case

7

well,, where was the article

8

of the Constitution of the United States raised in your

9

case?

10

Never.
MS. CARDEN:

That's correct.

We did not cite to

1 1

Article IV, Section 1, of the United States Constitution,

12

but we feel that because of the unique nature of the full

13

faith and credit clause, it has no

14

not something that the Court can mistake as being a reference

15

to a state constitution provision for full faith and credit.

16

QUESTION:

other reference.

It's

I suppose a state court can't simply

17

evade a properly preserved federal question by writing an

18

opinion saying that this case deals with a state law and

19

simply treating state issues.

20

MS. CARDEN:

Well, that would be our feeling about

21

the case because, of course, they did indicate, they recognized

22

that the Florida judgment was final, had been rendered three

23

weeks before, and yet then they went on and said, neverth-

24

less, the Georgia court has jurisdiction.

25

that their obvious result was that there was no full faith
17

So it indicates

1

or credit afforded.

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. CARDEN:

8
9

Well, we understood at that point that

we did --

6
7

When

you came to this Court you did cite it.

4
5

Then, why didn't you cite it here?

QUESTION:
eh?

Was this the first time you heard of it,

Is that the first time you heard of it?
MS. CARDEN:

No, Your Honor.

Of course, in the

state court, we had a number of grounds for enumerations of

10

error and here it is our only ground and then of course we've

1 1

raised it very specifically.

12

QUESTION:

Of course, the whole thrust of the Uni­

13

form Act is to, as some point, to persuade some state to

14

respect the judgment of another state, and so that, to call

15

it, it might be perfectly natural to refer to the obligations

16

under the Act as a full faith and credit obligation.

17

MS. CARDEN:

Well, of course, the Act specifically

18

refers to itself as being a comity-based statute and does not

19

of course have anything to do with anything related to full

20

faith and credit in the United States Constitution.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well,

it attempts to convince a state

it ought to give some respect to a judgment of another state.
MS.

CARDEN: That's correct; as a matter of comity,

by making laws more uniform in order to have it
QUESTION:

recognized.

Or a§ a matter of full faith and credit.
18

MS. CARDEN:

1

2
3

Well, we would argue that the Uniform

Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, of course, changes state law,
but it does eventually allow, mandates for the application of

4

full faith and credit in the U.S. Constitution, and to that

5

extent, yes, but the Act itself does not mandate full faith

6

and credit be given.

In rephrasing the issue that we-stated earli

7

er,' really all we are asking this Court to do is to look at the

8

judgment rendered in this case and to afford it the same

9

measure of full faith and credit as it would render or accord

10

to any other judgment regardless of its nature as a custody

11

decree.

12

We can find no evidence in either Article IV, Sec­

13

tion 1, or in the earlier opinions of this Court that would

14

indicate that just by its nature, as a custody decree, it

15

would not be entitled to full faith and credit.

16

there’s nothing in the exact wording of Article I, Section 4,

17

that says anything regarding custody decrees.

18

cases that this Court has dealt with prior to this time in

19

which a custody decree was sought to be accorded full faith

20

and credit, this Court has examined the custody decree to

21

determine whether it mandates full faith and credit to be

22

applied to other judgments and found that the very custody

23

decree examined did not meet certain requirements and the two

24

that this Court has dealt with previously have been the lack

25

of due process afforded to the defendant in the proceeding
19

Obviously,

In the four

1

and also in the past, the lack of finality that custody

2

decrees were accorded in the state in which they were renderec.
QUESTION:

3

Incidentally,

Ms. Carden, I gather this

uniform statute, it mandates, doesn't it, that the judge in

Florida communicate with the judge in Georgia?
MS. CARDEN:

6

Your Honor, I believe the exact lan­

7

guage of the statute says that when a court is informed that

8

there is a prior pending proceeding, that the court of the

9

second state is to communicate with the court of the first

10

state, but --

MS. CARDEN:

was pending and there has been no dispute that it was pending

several weeks before the institution of the Georgia proceeding

30 years ago.
QUESTION:

7

Ms. Carden, didn't the Georgia Supreme

8

Court say both trial courts were at fault in failing to

9

contact the other trial court?
MS. CARDEN:

10

That is what the Georgia Supreme Court

1 1

held.

12

court of the second state has the obligation to confer with

13

the state in which the original proceeding is pending first.

14

The actual wording of the statute actually says the

QUESTION:

Then, the question is, which is the

15

second state?

16

because the decree was originally a Georgia decree.

17

In a sense, Florida was the second state

MS. CARDEN:

Of course, but in Georgia -- and

18

Georgia may be very unique in this sense, Georgia courts do

19

not exercise any continuing jurisdiction once the decree is

20

rendered, so once the decree is rendered they lose their

21

jurisdiction unless a second suit is instituted under similar

22

residence and venue requirements, so there was nothing

23

pending in Georgia.

Supposing the Georgia court had

Wouldn't they

If, according to the Uniform Act, the

parties had -- well, everything had gone as, I think, the

10

Uniform Act considers it, upon learning of the pending

1 1

Florida proceeding -- and the Georgia court did know of that

12

long before the order was rendered in Florida -- there would

13

have been communication between the courts concerning which

14

was the appropriate forum and how the best manner in which

15

evidence could be taken could be arranged.

16

QUESTION:

Would you agree that in one court or

17

the other it would have been proper then to hold a hearing on

18

whether there'd been changed circumstances?

19

MS. CARDEN:

I think that the courts themselves

20

can determine which is the most appropriate forum and upon

21

that decision have the hearing.

22

QUESTION:

But if you admit that, then you're not

23

saying that the Georgia court was obliged to enter the same

24

decree that the Florida court had entered?

25

obliged to take it into account in deciding what to do?
22

He's merely

MS. CARDEN:

Had there been -- I would say that it

would not be impossible for the Georgia court to have had

without that final judgment rendered

Well, that's your full faith and credit

8

MS. CARDEN:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Tell me, does the statute say -- you

10

suggest that it's the Georgia judge who should have called the

1 1

Florida judge under the facts of this case.

12

say what happens if the Georgia judge didn't telephone the

13

Florida judge?

14

MS.

CARDEN:

No, there's no remedy provided in that

15

regard, in the statutory law.

16

QUESTION:

I mean, no suggestion that a failure to

17

call the

in the Georgia court, is it?

19

20
21

Does the statute

Florida judge meant

MS. CARDEN:

a

loss

of

jurisdiction

No, there's no penalty or remedy pro­

vided for the failure to comply with any of these sections.
QUESTION:

I think you' ve made, this point clear in an

22

answer to a previous question .from me, that ceftainly we have nc

23

jurisdiction to construe the Uniform Act unless it runs

24

afoul of the Full Faith and Credit Clause in some way.

25

MS. CARDEN:

Yes, I think the only -- really the
23

1

two sections of the Uniform Act that are important to the

2

full faith and credit issue, one, are the provisions which

3

provide for due process to be afforded to the respondent,

4

which of course is required under full faith and credit.

5

QUESTION:

Does the Act address a situation where

6

one state enters a final judgment like the Florida court did

7

here, and yet another state goes ahead, like Georgia did?

8

MS. CARDEN:

9

QUESTION: Does it purport to permit that?

10

MS. CARDEN:

The Act --

In a comity-based sense the Act says

11

that if one state has rendered a judgment in compliance with

12

the Act, then the1 other state shall honor it.

13

provision of the Act.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. CARDEN:

That's the

Of course, that's based on comity.
The Act is not before us, is it?
No, it's not, and the only other pro­

16

vision of the Act, other than the due process provisions which

17

do afford jurisdiction to the --

18

QUESTION:

Well, that's a Georgia statute.

I sup­

19

pose if a Georgia trial judge, after being informed of a final

20

judgment being entered in a Florida court, if he went ahead

21

and nevertheless entered a judgment of his own, he might be

22

reversed in a Georgia court on the grounds that he's violated

23

the state statute.

24

MS. CARDEN:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So that's obligatory.
24

It just isn't a

1

matter of comity, I mean.

2

does it say that?
MS. CARDEN:

3

The statute says, you must --

It says "shall."

"Shall enforce" the

4

statute.

5

Jurisdiction Act that's really relevant is the section which

6

does make custody decrees final, binding, and conclusive, and

7

does take away the previous status of the law which kept them

8

on the breast of the court, modifiable at any time, and I

9

think those are the only two areas where the Act really

10

The only other section of the Uniform Child Custody

has

relevance.
QUESTION:

11

Ms. Carden, if the parties now stipu­

12

lated to vacate the Georgia judgment, would there be any case

13

left at all?
MS. CARDEN:

14

No, Your Honor.

In fact, we had hoped

15

that that would occur after the child was exchanged in Novem­

16

ber.

17

the parties but evidently the respondent has not been willing

18

to do so, and as a result we have no assurance as to the

19

continuing legal status of the child.

20

We had hoped that there would be an agreement between

QUESTION:

But if there were a repeat performance

21

after July 1, 1981, there wouldn't be any problem either,

22

would there?

23

MS. CARDEN:

I hope there wouldn't be any problem

24

although the new Criminal Kidnapping Prevention Act of course

25

is based on principles of the Uniform Child Custody
25

1

Jurisdiction Act, and it would be subject to the same kind of

2

interpretation that perhaps has been handled in this case,

3

and there could be similar problems.

4

In summary, Your Honor, really all we're asking the

5

Court to do in this case is to scrutinize this custody decree

6

in terms of the mandates for full faith and credit to any

7

other judgment, and if it meets those mandates for the appli­

8

cation of full faith and credit, to apply full faith and

9

credit to this decree and allow -- to.reverse the judgment of

10

the Georgia Supreme Court, not affording full faith and

11

credit to it.

Thank you, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MANLEY F. BROWN, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BROWN:

15
16
17

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
As the Court knows from our brief, the primary

18

thrust of the respondent is that this is not, this case is not

19

the proper vehicle for this Court to address the serious

20

constitutional law problems which would be presented by this

21

petition for certiorari.

22
23

25

QUESTION:

Well, you certainly didn't help us much

in your response to the petition.
MR. BROWN:

Well, begging the Court's pardon, I per­

sonally didn't file that, in defense of myself.

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but I say the state didn't.

2

QUESTION:

We weren't alerted to the fact that --

3

MR. BROWN:

Well, of course, that's the main

4

problem with this whole case is that nobody, none of the

5

lawyers in the court below ever saw any of these issues.

6

They were never dealt with, they were never properly raised,

7

the Georgia Supreme Court never addressed them, and at the

8

point where I came into the case --

9

QUESTION:

But the petition

said that the issue

10

had been raised, and we no longer require the filing of

records with our petitions for certiorari, like we did his­

14

about it, doesn't challenge it.

And so, nor -- it's not unusual to credit a state­

I was appointed by the Court after the

MR. BROWN:

-- arrived at this level.

And at that

23

point I raised every conceivable point that immediately

24

occurred to me, namely, that the point had not been properly

25

raised in the Georgia Supreme Court.
27

Because the portion of

the record that fully exposes the fact that this issue was

If you look at it at

If you look at the motion for rehearing, you'll see

1 1

that it states only that the Georgia Supreme Court ignored

12

relevant Georgia precedent and that it rendered a decision on

13

an incorrect interpretation of the Uniform Act.

faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution, Article

16

IV, Section 1.

Now, those words were used a couple of times in the

18

record but they were never used with very much precision, and

19

ordinarily the Georgia Supreme Court would not totally ignore

20

that issue.

21

see that they have dealt with full faith and credit, and at

22

least they would have graced the contention by saying that it

23

lacked merit.

As you look at other decisions of the Court you

As it is, they didn't even mention it.

QUESTION:

Here are two of your three justices dis­

senting from the disposition of the case, at Joint Appendix
28

1

on page 53, and none of them refer to the Full Faith and

2

Credit Clause.
MR. BROWN:

3

Exactly.

They were complaining that

4

the majority had returned to authorization of child snatching

5

and had misconstrued that.
QUESTION:

6
7

didn't cite its own Rule 45?
MR.

8
9

Why do you suppose your Supreme Court

BROWN:

I have no idea.

I imagine they just

were never aware that the enumeration of error was intended

10

to even raise a federal constitutional provision, because

1 1

they regularly cite Rule 45 as to enumerations of error which

12

have not been supported by evidence.
QUESTION:

13

While I have you interrupted, may I ask,

14

Mr.

Brown, what about the return by — he's your client now --

15

of the child to the mother? •
MR.

16

BROWN:

>

Youi Honor, it's my understanding the chile

17

is not with the mother but the child is with the maternal grand­

18

mother.

19

advised of that by prior counsel in the case.

20

I have been advised by Mr. Webb -- I made that specific

21

inquiry of him last week, because I knew the Court would ask

22

about it -- and he advised me again that the child is with

23

his ex-wife's mother, and not returned to the --

24
25

That's in my brief, the initial brief I filed.

QUESTION:

Since that time

mother?
29

I was

MR.

BROWN:

No, she lives somewhere else.

She lives

I think, in Jacksonville, Florida, and the mother lives over

of the matter is, because I haven't seen with my own eyes

don't understand.

Now, in addition to the other points that we raised

22

in our brief, and suggested to the Court, that this case

23

ought not be heard on the merits,'I want to suggest to the

24

Court that in connection with this new federal act, the

25

Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, it's not at all
30

1

clear, I don't think, that that particular Act goes into

2

effect only on July 1 of 1981.

3

the Court, some argument can be made -- and I'm not sure which

4

one of us would win under the Act, but I think a reasonable

5

argument can be made that the Act became effective on

6

December 28 when President Carter signed the Act into law.

7

I say that because the Act was part of some social security

8

amendments dealing with pneumococcal vaccine services and the

9

Delayed Effective Date Act, if'you read the language 'carefully

I think, in being candid with

10

you see that it refers only to services provided, which

1 1

clearly indicates that the Delayed Effective Date1Act refers to

12

the pneumococcal vaccine amendment and. hot to the Parental

13

Kidnapping Prevention Act.

14

There are two other delayed effective dates in that

15

legislative

package, both relating to other sections.

There

16

is no suggestion whatsoever in the Act that the parental

17

Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980 is to have a delayed effec­

18

tive date until July 1, 1981.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BROWN:

Where in your brief is that?
If Your Honor pleases, the Act was

21

passed sort of at the 11th hour, and I don't think we even

22

had a copy of it until after I filed the brief and the reason

23

I'm mentioning it to you in oral argument is because it's not

24

in the brief, to try to give the Court that information.

25

if we need to supplement that by way of additional brief,
31

And

1

we'll do it, with the Court's permission.

In addition to

2

that, the legislative history of this particular Act indicates

3

that it was considered as part of several legislative pack­

4

ages.

5

suggested that the Act should have a delayed effective date.

In none of those legislative undertakings was it ever

QUESTION:

6

Ms. Carden has conceded -- we wouldn't

7

necessarily hold her to that -- she has conceded that if the

8

Act were in effect now, there would be no case at all.

9

said, if it was only a problem between now and July 1 -- now,

She

10

if you're telling us that there's no problem even now, betweer

11

now and July 1, that might be relevant.

12

submit some observations on that subject.
MR. BROWN:

13

I suggest that you

With the Court's permission we would

14

submit a supplemental brief on that point, if the Court de­

15

sires.

16

not that clear.

17

Frankly, I don't know who wins under the new Act; it's

QUESTION:

Well, anyway, Mr. Brown, if there is a

18

cullable possibility that the Act is in effect, I suppose

19

what we'd do is send it back for reconsideration under the Act

20

MR. BROWN:

Well, I think you could look at the Act

21

in connection with the principles of Bradley v. School Board

22

of Richmond, as to whether you would apply an Act which came

23

into being while the case was on appeal.

24

QUESTION:

25

instance, probably.

But we wouldn't decide that in the first

32

MR.

1

BROWN:

I don't see any need to do it.

I 'm

2

just saying that the Court could, if it saw fit to do so.

3

At any rate,

4

Act does not come into effect until July 1, 1981, it still

5

has such an impact on this case that it sterilizes the con­

6

stitutional issues in the case insofar as this particular

7

proceeding is concerned so that it really does not make sense

8

for this Court to get into these constitutional issues when

9

an Act of

10

if the Act, if the Court concludes that the

Congress pursuant to Article IV, Section 1, is

purporting to deal with this.

1 1

Now, I realize that this Act still doesn't cure the

12

monumental, necessarily cure the monumental personal juris­

13

diction problem that underlies this whole problem between the

14

states, but still it's a step in the right direction.

15

think the Court under the doctrine of such cases as Rice v.

16

Sioux Memorial Park should consider that even though the

17

Act is not in effect now,

18

that it would render of isolating significance this particu­

19

lar case.

20

QUESTION:

And I

it has such an impact on this case

Since you seem to have the matter well

21

in the front of your mind, perhaps you can have that to us

22

by the end of this week?

MR.

BROWN:

All right,

sir.

We'll endeavor to do

that.
QUESTION:

It doesn't have to be printed.

33

1

QUESTION:

No, this can be typewritten, I assure you.

2

MR. BROWN:

Now, there's one other issue that was

3

not adequately briefed that I want to call to the Court's at­

4

tention and it has to do with a question of cooperation be­

5

tween the Florida and the Georgia courts and what Florida

6

should have done.

7

Uniform Act that's never been mentioned that in preparation

8

for oral argument I came across it, and it said that --

QUESTION:

We really have no jurisdiction to second

10

guess the Georgia Supreme Court on the interpretaion of the

1 1

Uniform Act.

12

MR. BROWN:

Well, this provision has something to

13

do, I think, with personal jurisdiction and how to go about

14

handling the Act without triggering this type of question and

15

causing it to come to this Court.

17

sions which this Court discussed in Kulko, in the footnotes

ceeding like this is filed to contact the Georgia judge and

20

ask the Georgia court to initiate a proceeding over their

21

resident

22

him to come to Florida to participate in this child custody

23

decision and the Georgia Act has the correlative section

24

which is 20(c) which says that if they get a request from a

25

Florida judge, they are bound to exercise personal jurisdictio n

That's Section 19(b) of

19(b) does authorize the Florida judge when a pro­

over whom they have personal jurisdiction compelling

So that, what I'm saying is, it was unnecessary to

get into the constitutional problems that you have in this

were available in the Act.

Mr. Brown, could they do that even now?

ment in the Florida action and say, well, there've been

have somebody try this thing out with --

MR. BROWN:

Certainly.

I think this thing is still

19

a wide-open issue, I think it's the problem that this Court

has always seen with child custody decrees, they're never

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. MARY R. CARDEN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

MS, CARDEN:

Do

I'd just like to make a few remarks in

response to Mr. Brown's comments.

21

First of all, of course, comitv as we mentioned

22

before doesn't demand full faith and credit and in this case

23

Georgia did not afford full faith and credit to the Florida

24

decree, regardless of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction

25

Act.

So no decision in this matter even though Georgia may
41

1

have not said, we don't think Article IV, Section 1, does

2

not apply, the opinion still is there that Georgia under

3

precedent of Webb v. Webb does not have to give any kind of

4

importance or consideration to a final iudgment of another

5

state on the basis of that decision.

6

Also, he mentioned the case of Halvey v. Halvev.

7

And at that time Florida law provided that custody decrees

8

could be modified even on the basis of facts that were not

9

before the court at the time of its original decree, and I

10

believe that was the reason that this Court had such a diffi­

1 1

cult time applying full faith and credit to Halvey.

12

that time that law has been changed with the Uniform Child

13

Custody Jurisdiction Act, and the only possibility for modi­

14

fication does deal with a material change of circumstances

15

occurring after the original decree.
