CRAB ARGUMENT OF BRUCE E. JOHNSON, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. JOHNSON:

CHIIF JUSTICE BURGER:: We will hear arguments ■

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a state law damage action com­

9

10

menced in state court in Iowa because of damages allegedly

1 1

sustained due. to the cessation of interstate transporta.!ion

12
13
14

15
16
17

18
19

service over the Railroad's line serving the respondent's
f actoi’y.
The issues are as follows.

First, have provisions

of the Interstate Commerce Act preempted state court damage
actions founded on state law in the areas of provision of
interstate transportation service that are involved in the
facts of this case?

Secondly, has an earlier ruling of the

Interstate Commerce Commission precluded the respondent from
relitigating issues that are necessary to the success of the

20

respondent's state law damage claims?
21

Prior to entry of the judgment

of the Iowa tria]

22

court, the Commerce Commission ruled that the cessation of
23

interstate se.rvice over the Railroad's line

was caused by

24

conditions that were beyond the control of the Railroad, and
25

3

1

the Railroad's issue preclusion defense contends that in order

2

for the respondent's state lav? theories to be sustained the

3

respondent would have to obtain an Iowa trial court ruling

4

that the conditions that led to the cessation of service were

5

in fact within the control, or could have been prevented by

6

the Railroad.

QUESTION:

7

8

Secondly -What was the nature of the ICC proceeding

Mr. Johnson?
MR. JOHNSON:

9

The ICC proceeding was an abandonment

10

application.

1 1

permission from the Commerce Commission to abandon its track­

12

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

20

21

age.

The Railroad filed an application to receive

The Railroad's abandonment, application was filed after'

the respondent had decided to go out cf business and after
the respondent had ceased operating his business.

The Rail­

road then filed an application for permission to abandon, and
a year and half after service ceased over the trackage, the
respondent filed an action in state court seeking damages
grounded on state law theories.
This case involves the Supremacy Clause, it involves
interstate commerce provisions which require interstate car­
riers tc provide interstate service, transportation service;
Commerce Act provisions which require interstate carriers to

22

provide interstate car service; it involves the provisions of
23

the Act which regulate the abandonment and extension of lines,
24

and also the provisions of the Commerce Act that entitle
25

4

1

a shipper to commence an action for damages either before the

2

Interstate Commerce Commission or in federal district court:

3

where they can prove a violation of the Commerce Act on the

4

part of interstate carrier.

5

before the Commission or in federal district court.

6

it went to state court and seeks damages under a state, car

7

service theory, a state car service statute, a state negligence:

8

statute, and common law tortious interference.

9

QUESTION:

Ka! o did not commence its action
Instead,

What if the shipper had sought to sue the

10

Railroad under the Hepburn Act, under the Carmack Amendment to

1 1

the ICC, is federal court jurisdiction there exclusive?

12

MR. JOHNSON:

Section 9 would permit a damage action

13

to be. filed before the Commission or in federal district court.

14

If a damage action were filed in federal district court, under

15
16
17

18
19

20

the circumstances of this case, I think that the federal dis­
trict court would stay the action and refer the issue of
causation of cessation of service to the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
QUESTION:

But what if it were -- you say then that

it couldn't be filed in the state court?
MR. JOHNSON:

No, because, if you look at --

21

QUESTION:

No, what?

No, you can't file it, or

22

no, you can?
23

MR. JOHNSON:

No, you could not file an ei.cti.on

24

claiming violation of the. Interstate Commerce Act In state
25

5

1

court.

2

strued in Puritan, among others, which is a case relied upon

3

by the Respondent --

4

9 damage actions to the forums set cut in Section 9, which

5

are the Commerce Commission and federal district court.

6

there are good reasons for doing that.

And here is the reason.

The Commerce Act has been con­

it's been construed to restrict Section

And

First of all, if you restrict it to federal district

7

8

court or the Commerce Commission, you are going to have one

9

system of federal law vthich is going to govern damage actions

10

as well as the other regulatory functions of the; Commission.

1 1

However, if you allow the Commerce Act, if you allow damage

12

actions for violation of the Commerce Act to be filed in state

13

court, you are essentially allowing each state to create a

14

separate regulatory system consisting of damage actions and

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

the U.S. Supreme Court faced a similar situation in San Diego
Unions v.

Garmon, where the U.S.

Supreme Court recognized that

if it permitted state damage actions to be filed by an employer
for economic loss sustained because of peaceful picketing, not
violent picketing, then in effect it would be allowing a state,
court system to create a system of regulation by damage actions
which would create a separate body of law competing with the
body of law that is created under the federal judici.al system
interpreting and applying the National Labor Relations Act.
QUESTION:

But it's one thing to say that the body of

law lias to be common and uniform; but it's another thing to sa;
25

6

1

that concurrent jurisdiction exists between the state courts

2

and the federal courts in applying that uniform body of law.
MR. JOHNSON:

3

The Esch Car Service Act, and in the

4

context of this case, more importantly, I think, the Trans­

5

portation Act of 1920 evidence a new and radically different

6

philosophy of Congress with regard to regulation of interstate

7

commerce.

8

The Transportation Act of 1920 was designed to give

9

plenary control, exclusive jurisdiction to the federal system

10

to govern the provision of interstate transportation service,

1 1

the abandonment of lines, the extension of lines, and the rea­

12

son for that, the Court in Transit Commission v. U. S. stated,

13

is because it had been found that concurrent state and

14

federal jurisidction in the areas of interstate commerce

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22

addressed in the 1920 Act had been found to be detrimental to
interstate commerce.
The competing local interest in this case, the
respondent's local interest, is economic loss, and if you
analyze his state law claims, although the claims of the
respondent are couched in terms of state law, they are claiming
damage to their business because of cessation of interstate
transportation service.
proof of two things:

And each state law claim requires

first, the existence of a duty on the

23

part of the Railroad to provide interstate transportation
24

service; and secondly, to prove that such a duty was breached
25

by the Railroad.
2

It is undisputed -- and this is the crucial and

3

central fact of this case -- it is undisputed that every rail

4

shipment to and from Kalo's factory was in interstate commerce.

5

Now, if there is no duty on the part of the Raiilroad after

6

April 4, 1973, when the line became physically impassable,

7

there is no duty on the part of the Railroad after that date

8

to provide interstate transportation service, then Kalo's

9

state law claims fall, because they all presuppose the exis­

10

tence of that duty.

1 1

physical injury or something of that nature: where there may

12

have existed a stronger local

13

QUESTION:

14

15

This is not a situation where there is a

interest.

Would your position here be any different

if ten percent of the shipments were intrastate?
MR. JOHNSON:

That issue has been addressed by some

16

state: courts and that percentage; basically, in state courts,

17

most of the state courts have said, that's not enough intra­

18
19

20

21
22

state commerce to set aside, the overriding national interest.
But I think the way to determine that question is to look at
Section 1-17(a) of 1 he Commerce Act, which says the states'
regulation of intrastate commerce is invalid if it conflicts
with a. lawful order of the Commission.,

And I think that the

cases indicate that under the Commerce Act, the Commerce Act
23

will govern even intrastate commerce if the effect cf intra­
24

state commerce on interstate commerce is so great that it
25

8

1

creates an undue burden on interstate commerce.

2

In this case we have no intrastate rail shipments,

3

it's strictly interstate.

4

dispute about that in this lawsuit.

5

characterized this as a negligence case, a car service case,

6

common law tortious interference.

7

theories hold any weight unless the respondent proves a duty

8

to provide interstate rail service to its plant site.

9

And that is an inquiry which sould be; addressed under the pro­

10

There's never been any factual
And the respondent has

But none of those state law

visions of the Interstate Commerce Act.
QUESTION:

1 1

You say, then, that the State of Iowa

12

can't tell a railroad it must provide the car service to a

13

particular plant, even though it doesn't conflict directly with

14

the ICC provisions?
MR. JOHNSON:

15
16

17

18
19

20

The State of Iowa cannot require provi­

sion of interstate car service under sts.te law.

The Esch Car

Service Act was enacted to preempt state law, and Missouri
Pacific Railroad v. Stroud in 1926 stated that state law lias
no application to provision of car service in interstate com­
merce.

Now, the Federal Courthouse in Fort Dodge is four

blocks from the State Courthouse, and the Interstate Commerce
21

Act provides that if there: is a violation of the federal

car

22

service provisions or transportation service provisions, that
23

may be attacked in the Commerce Commission or in federal dis24

trict court.
25

And it's attacked under' the provisions of the

1

Interstate Commerce Act.

2

The Interstate Commerce Act has been construed to

3

make the forum provisions of Section 9

exclusive with. regard

4

to a damage action commenced pursuant to Section 8 of the

5

Interstate Commerce Act.

6

reason for -- in addition to the reason for having interstate

7

service questions determined under one act, the Interstate

8

Commerce Act, there is another reason, and that is that the

9

philosophy of the Interstate Commerce Act has been to place

And, as I indicated earlier, the.

10

the. interests in forming a national transportation system, an

1 1

economically efficient national transportation system, over anc

12

above the competing local

QUESTION: Mr. Johnson, do I correctly understand that

13
14

15
16
17

this argument based on the absence of a.ny state law duty is
equally strong if there had been no abandonment, proceeding?
You don't rely on the abandonment proceeding in connection
with this argument?
MR. JOHNSON:

18
19

interests.

--

I do not.

The abandonment proceeding

the ruling of the Commerce Commission buttresses our argu­

ment. in two respects.

First, before there was any tria]

court

20

ruling --- which, by' the way/, the trial court ruled in our
21

favor and the Court of Appeals saw fit to reverse.
22

Before there was any trial

court judgment, the

23

Commerce ruled, the Commerce. Commission ruled that cur cessa­
24

tion of service was not due to any condition that we could
25

If:

1

have controlled. Now, that puts the Court of Appeals of Iowa's

2

ruling directly in conflict with Section 1-17(a) which says

3

that even regulation of intrastate service is, invalid if it

4

conflicts with the lawful order of the Commission.
Here we have the Court of Appeals saying that a

5

6

Webster County District Court can regulate by damage action

7

interstate transportation service in direct contradiction to

8

an order of the ICC.

9

that central and necessary to its state law claim is a finding

The Respondent admitted in its brief

10

by the tidal court that the cessation of service was due to

1 1

conditions within the control cf the Railroad.

12

has found just the opposite.
So having followed the Interstate Commerce Act,

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

And the ICC

followed the provisions, gone to the ICC, participated in a
proceeding in which Kalo was a party, and having our conduct
approved by the ICC, we now find ourselves in the situation of
being subjected to exposure of a state law damage action which
can be successful by the respondent's admission in its brief
only if

a

trial court reaches a finding opposite to the

finding that ICC has already made in a lawful proceeding.
So I think that the ICC's order should be issue

21

preclusive, even if there were jurisdiction in the state
22

court.

But more importantly, I think that there should be no

23

jurisdiction permitted tc a state court when you're talking
24

about simply provision of interstate transportation service.
25

11

1

QUESTION:

Do you say the plaintiff could attack the

2

action of the Railroad either before the IOC oi’ in the federal

3

district court?
HR. JOHNSON:

4

Under Section 9 the plaintiff may seek

5

damages in either of those forums for a violation of the

6

Interstate Commerce Act.
QUESTION:

7

But, if he sues in the federal district

8

court, don't the controlling cases suggest or hold that the

9

district court should refer the guts of the case to the ICC?
MR. JOHNSON:

10

I feel that In the situation we have

1 1

in this case, where you have physical impassability of the

12

line, I think a district court, where you're talking about

13

awarding damages --

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRI F. RUSH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

5

MR. RUSH:

6
7

8
9

Mr. Rush.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
This Court has held in a number of decisions inter­
preting the Esch Car Service Act, a statute which my colleague

10

referred to, and also the Transportation Act of 1920, which

1 1

brought for the first time extension and abandonment of rail

12

lines under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, under

13

federal regulation.

14

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

This Court has held that the provisions of these
Acts vests exclusive responsibility for the regulation of car
service arid cessation of service in the Interstate Commerce
Commission.

Principally among those and on which we largely

rest our case in this proceeding are this Court's decisions in
Colorado v. United States, in the Purcell case, in the Transit
Commission case, and in the case of Mo. Pac. v. Stroud.
The Government has urged this Court to grant certirari and appears today to present a single point, but one that

22

is of extreme importance to the Commission in performing its
23

responsibilities under the provisions I have just referred to.
24

That point is that the recognition of a state or
25

15

1

common law cause of a.ction for damages in state court in mat­

2

ters relating to an interstate railroad cessation of service

3

would undermine the accomplishment of federal objectives em­

4

bodied in the abandonment and car service provisions of the

5

Interstate Commerce Act.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Rush, what do you do with that last

7

paragraph in Stroud that says the state law has no application

8

to the furnishing of cars to shippers for the transportation

9

of freight in interstate commerce?
MR. RUSH:

10

Well, I would hang my hat on it, Justice

1 1

Rehnquist.

12

that a state damage action is asserted on a matter involving

13

either car service or abandonment, both of which have been

14

found to be within the exclusive province of the Federal

15
16
17

18
19

20

I mean, that seems to me exactly the point here,

Government and the Commission to regulate.

.So that, I mean,

I would simply underline that sentence that you read, that
it does have no applicability.

And that as this Court recog­

nized in the Government case, damages are as effective a way
of regulating as injunctive or regulatory relief.

Indeed,

I would suggest to this Court that the right asserted here
to obtain damages after the fact is vastly more pernicious and

21

disruptive of the federal scheme than the seeking of injunctive
22

relief.
23

QUESTION:

Is it a form of review, in a sense, of

24

the Commission’s action?

Judicial review by a state court?

25

16

1

MR.

RUSH i

Mr.

Chief Justice, that thought hadn'.t oc­

MR. RUSH:

you?

Yes, I think it would.

And, of course,

10

a state court could in theory refer a question to the Commis­

1 1

sion and get an answer back from the Commission.

12

would suppose it might be closer to that, although they did

13

not refer the question, nor did they in any fashion defer. And

14

15
16
17

18
19

And so I

as my colleague, Mr. Johnson points out, they can't defer, for
the plaintiff to succeed.
QUESTION:

Well,

the action that it got bacl
MR. PUSH:

would the state court be bound by
from the ICC?

A state court?

I should think so.

A federal court, I would think that our decision on referral,
under the Referral Act would be as binding on that Court as the

20

reasoning which went into it.
21

QUESTION:

Then, you don’t really have a. uniform

22

system if, as your colleague contends, where you. have it in
23

the federal court alone, since the federal court according to
24

you is not bound to follow the ICC.
25

17

MR. PUSH: No, but it would be subject to normal

1

2

principles of judicial review so that provided the reasoning

3

was sound and we stayed within our statutory authority , they

4

would be obligated to follow it, in my view.
QUESTION:

5

6

Court of Appeals rather than in the district court?
MR. RUSH:

7

8

Why wouldn't that be reviewable in the

Because if it were referred, initial re­

view is by law in the district court that referred it.
QUESTION: That's because of the referral statute?

9

MR. RUSH:

10

Yes, Justice White.

They perform a mixed

1 1

review and acceptance of the referral, but then appeal from

12

that, of course, goes to the Court of Appeals.

13
14

19

MR. RUSH:

Yes, it would be on the record, just as

any other agency proceeding.
QUESTION:

17

18

But review is on the record, isn't it, or

is it?

15
16

QUESTION:

Cnee --

But the district court couldn't rehear the

whole matter, could it?

It would have to review it on the

record ?
MR. RUSH:

No, sir.

No

*

QUESTION:

Why?

MR. RUSH:

It would be my view they cannot review it

20
21

22

ab initio, that they would have to accept the record made
23

before the Commission.

And in that respect it --

I do not want to leave the impression that it had tc

But to turn to this question of damages and the

problem that we preceive in connection with that, the respon­

8

dents don't suggest, nor could they in the face of the cases

decided by this Court which I have named, that the state court

10

could require the restoration of service.

1 1

relief, actually, is preferable from the standpoint that you

12

have the equitable considerations being laid in that context.

13

And the

14

strate that when action is brought in federal court, as all

15

of their cases parenthetically I would note, were --- they have

16

been

17

18
19

20
21

22

cases

But injunctive

cited in the respondent's own brief demon­

properly brought before a federal court -- the question

becomes one of whether it is equitable to require restoration
of service pending a decision by the Commission.

That in­

junction, of course, dies when a decision has been handed down
by the Commission, if in fact a. mandatory injunction is
entered.
QUESTION:

And then the Commission's decision is

reviewable only in the normal appellate process?
23
24

MR. RUSH:

That's correct, Justice Rehnquist.

Respondents in the Court of Appeals relied through their1
25

19

1

proposition supporting an award of damages ultimately entirely

2

on three decisions of this Court, decided in 1915 and 1916,

3

interpreting Section 22 of the Act.

4

We believe those cases are all distinguishable on

5

the ground that no question of the reasonableness of the

6

Railroad's challenged practice was before the courts, and hence

7

if one were to take a primary jurisdiction approach to the;

8

issue of preemption, the;re would have been nothing tc defer

9

to the Commission’s primary jurisdiction.

However, more fun­

10

damentally, we submit that those decisions ought, to be found

1 1

not to have survived the enactment cf the Esch Car Service Act

12

and the Transportation Act of 1920.

13
14

15
16

17

18
19

As I have indicated, this court: has held that those
enactments vested sole jurisdiction or responsibility, I
should say, in the Commission for regulation of the: matters of
car service and cessation of rail service.

This Court has

consistently recognized that Section 22 is not to be read
literally to absolutely preserve common law rights.

It's early

decision in Texas 6 Pacific Railway v. Abilene Cotton Oi]
Company found that to hold that a state right of damages sur­

20

21

vived because of Section 22 would be destructive tc the perva­
sive scheme of rate regulation embodied wi.thin the Act.

22

And hence it ought to be found not to survive.
23

We believe that the Esch Car Service. Act and the
24

Transportation Act cf 1920 similarly encompass a pervasive
25

20

1

scheme of regulation, where'■ interstate commerce anci interstate

2

railroads are involved,

3

tion of rail service by such an interstate carrier.

4

of al] matters relating to the cessa­

We ask this Court to find, as it did in -- or to

5

hold as it did in the rate area, that no such remedy survives

6

in connection with these matters under any circumstances.

7

.Anything less than that, a resort to the question of, are there

8

issues of primary jurisdiction or not, will simply breed more

9

litigation, I suggest, in this area, and it is not a satisfac­

10

tory test.

In the rate area the Court has absolutely and

1 1

clearly foreclosed state and common law remedies.

12

to do so in connection with the cessation of interstate rail

13

service.
QUESTION:

14

We ask it

Is primary jurisdiction simply a question

15

of deferral and then the Court ultimately deciding, or is it

16

a question that the Court simply keeps its hands off and it's

17

a decision for the Commission to finally make?
MR.

18
19

20

23
24

25

Literally, as I've always considered the

doctrine, it means that the Court must defer initially to a
decision by the Commission.
QUESTION:

22

PUSH:

When you say "initially," what do you

mean ?
MR. RUSH:

Well, it's subject to -- as I indicated

to you earlier, Justice Rehnquist, a review on the traditional
grounds of judici.al review of Commission decisions.
23

So it has

1

some limited role, but -QUESTION:

2

It's not like a review under the Adminis­

3

trative Procedure Act, where any agency action can be reviewed

4

for it's arbitrary or contrary to law.
MR. RUSH:

5

No, sir, I'm suggesting it is comparable

6

to APA review, but that that is a very limiting type of review.

7

It does not make the Court a co-equal partner, it is not at

8

Well, then, for your eocounsel or your

associate counsel for the Railroad to state that the courthouse
at Fort Dodge is only four miles or four blocks away, is
really rather elusive so .far as the plaintiff is concerned
because it means that the plaintiff has to come back to
Washington.
MR. RUSH:

I'm not sure that I follow that argument,

21

22

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean, you can't get a .final trial

23

of your case in the federal court if you're right.

as modified procedure which was in fact followed in this case,

only if a material issue of fact were in dispute, would the

indeed, probably, under Commission practice, would have taken

place out in Iowa.
QUESTION:

14

As I understand it, Mr.

And that

Rush, your posi­

15

tion is that there is no room here for the doctrine of primary

jurisdiction or for a reference to the Commission by a. state

court, but that, the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act

18
19

20

21

and its companion legislation means that state courts eire
completely ousted from jurisdiction in this field.

Is that

correct?
MR.

RUSH:

That's correct, Justice Stewart.

That is

exactly our position.
QUESTION:

Do you mean, not only state law is ousted

but the state courts are ousted?
QUESTION:

Right.

Just as in ratemaking proceedings

MR. BLACKBURN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

23

Court:
24

An affirmance of the Iowa Court of Appeals decision
25

1

in this case would not do violence to the railroad industry,

2

nor would it do violence to the federal scheme for regulating

3

the industry or to national transportation policy.

Your Honors, we submit that it would cause railroads to make

5

early decisions about abandonment plans.

Instead,

6

We also submit that it would avoid the practice ---

QUESTION:

8
9

By that

you mean that it would go to

the state courts first?
MR. BLACKBURN:

10

QUESTION:

1 1

MR. BLACKBURN:

Yes, Your Honor. And —

On the abandonment of an interstate line?
The facts of this case, Your Honor,

12

show that the railroad was neglected over a long period of

13

time and ultimately failed because of that neglect.

14

Transportation Company had made an early decision to abandon

15

that line, the Kalo Brick and Tile Company which is now out of

16

business could have made management decisions about relocation

other companies.
QUESTION:

But suppose you're contemplating building

this plant, no plant is there, so you build, a plant there.
Could the state courts of Iowa compel service to that plant?
MR. BLACKBURN:

Your Honor, we do not think that is

going to be an issue in this case.
QUESTION:

No, that's hypothetical.

MR. BLACKBURN:

Bight.

25

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. BLACKBURN:

3

QUESTION:

4

Obviously not an issue here.
No, we would not claim that at all.

But once the service is available, it must

be maintained?
MR. BLACKBURN:

5

Right.

At least the tract must be

6

maintained, and the car service must be maintained under the

7

Iowa statutes.
QUESTION:

8
9

Whait else would there be besides the track and the service?
MR. BLACKBURN:

10
1 1

Weil, what else -- I'm not sure I follow.

Well, we. would suggest., Your Honor,

that those state statutes do impose duties upon the Railroad.
QUESTION:

12

Weil, certainly if you were dealing with

13

an int.erurban service between two cities in Iowa or a public

14

utility, the state would have, the right to require the utility

15

to extend its services to any willing customer under existing

16

law, would it not?
MR. BLACKBURN:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22

Yes, Your Honor.

In the absence of congressional preemp­

tion .
MR. BLACKBURN:

Right.

We would also suggest, Your

Honor, that if would be, it would avoid the kind — Railroad
and the amicus in this case discussed somewhat obliquely the
unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce.

We suggest to

23

this Court that there is a reverse burden upon interstate

commerce by the action, the unilateral neglect, the unilateral

26

abandonment, that the Chicago North Western has taken, and we

2

would also suggest that an affirmance of the Iowa Court of

3

Appeals would have a tendency to stabilize the railroad indus­

4

5

shipper and between the Interstate Commerce Commission.

6

between the

We suggest, Your Honors, that the fault, or the

7

problem with the petitioner's position in this case is simple.

8

It was pointed out by Justice Frankfurter in the case of

9

Pan American Oil Company v. Superior Court about 20 years ago,

10

and that is this, that a party who brings the suit is the

1 1

master to decide what law he will rely upon.

12

trict court of Iowa, the Kalo Brick £ Tile Company relied upon

13

three theori.es.

And in the dis­

The first w^as failure to provide car service,

to Iowa Statute 479.3.

The second and the most important one

to the issues here, is the fact that Kalo pled a cause; of
action based upon the negligence of the Railroad and its
employees, a state statute.
And that statute, I've pointed it out here and I
don't like; to take a let of time reading, but it says,
"Every corporation operating a railroad, shall be
liable for all damages sustained by any person in the
consequences of the acts of the agents."

23

There, is a.lso a third, kind of a throwaway issue and
24

that is, interference with prospective business advantage or'

business relationships.

Now, both the Railroad and the amicus

Yes, sir.

Assume that the Railroad was losing money

on this ] ine. and they went in before the ICC and got an aban­
donment on economic grounds that it's a Joss operation and it's
not necessary to maintain the public interest and the ICC gave
permission.

Would there have been any duty under Iowa law

to continue to operate?
MR. BLACKBURN:

Your Honor, we do not contend ---

and here■is where the amicus and'the railroad and we are in
agreement -- we disagree, we. do riot disagree with very much
of what they said.

We simply say, what they say does not

apply to the facts of this case.
QUESTION:

Your answer is, no, I take it?

22

MR. BLACKBURN: My answer is, no.
23

QUESTION:

Well, if there's no duty in that case,

24

they can willfully abandon.

Why can't they negligently

25

28

1

abandon?
MR. BLACKBURN:

2

Because the Interstate Commerce Com­

3

mission Act does provide for provisions for abandonment and

4

has language to the effect.
QUESTION:

5

But I mean, as a matter of Iowa 3 aw.

6

I'm assuming they comply with federal law in either case, and

7

I'm asking you, as a matter of Iowa law, if they can willfully

8

abandon, why can't they carelessly abandon?

9

that's reaching the same duty, I would think.
MR. BLACKBURN:

10

It would --

Well, we would suggest they could,

1 1

but then they would subject themselves to the jurisdiction of

12

the Iowa court if they carelessly abandoned.

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20

We say that is

this case.
QUESTION:

But if they don't have a duty to refrain

from willful abandonment, what is the nature of the duty to
refrain from negligent abandonment.?
MR. BLACKBURN:

We woulc suggest, Your Honor, under

-- the duty arises under the statute
QUESTION:

that provides --

Well, would they have a defense to your

action if they filed an answer and said, we didn't do this
negligently, we planned it five years ago.

We let the ponds

21

develop and we were doing it because we intended to abandon.
22

It's exactly what our corporate objective was.
23

MR. BLACKBURN:

No, I do not -- I do not think that

would isolate them from liability, if that's what your

question is.

But you seem to acknowledge there'd be no

BLACKBURN:

Whether they were negligent or not,

yes .
QUESTION:

At any rate, we have the decision of the

final, court in Iowa that passed on the question that in the
circumstances of this case: a damage action was permissible
under state law.

So that unless there's a federal question

that the Iowa court decided wrongly, Iowa allows recovery here.
MR. BLACKBURN:

Yes, Your Honor, that is true.

And

that is based upon -- and this is an issue that goes to -23
24

when this case was first started plaintiff's attorneys relied
upon three United States Supreme Court decisions and three

Iowa Supreme Court decisions and a decision of the 9th Circuit

3

And to our knowledge those cases, none of them, have ever been

QUESTION:

Mr. Blackburn, before you get to facts,

are you going to talk about the Colorado case?

You talked

about the other one.
MR. BLACKBURN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

MR. BLACKBURN:

We think those cases are all cases

18

involving regula-1..ion and not remedy, and the amicus disparages
19

our attempt to distinguish between the remedial effect as
20

opposed to the regulatory effect cf a regulatory scheme.
21

And Your Honor, we suggest this, that --

and it might be some­

22

what trite to suggest that the regulatory scheme falls basi­
23

cally within what we've known as the police power, whereas the
24

remedies involve suits between parties.
25

31

And so therefore we

1

think that there is a great distinction in those kinds of

cases.

MR. BLACKBURN:

8
9

Well, Your Honor --

by the amicus a.nd the Chicato North Western are cases which

are apposite to this case.

They are cases involving discrimi­

things which are not within the facts

of this case.
QUESTION:

How about the Stroud case, that last lan­

guage there where it says that obviously the state law has no
application tc the furnishing of car’s to shippers for the
transportion of freight in interstate commerce?
MR. BLACKBURN:

Well, that again, Your Honor, is a

nice statement but taiken -- it's in the case itself, it's
stated somewhat hypothetically without reference to the facts
of the case.

And we have no argument with the suggestion of

the amicus or the Chicago North Western that the Interstate
Commerce Commission does have exclusive jurisdiction over such

25

32

1

things as rates, over such things as abandonments, over such

2

things as rate discrimination, discrimination against the

3

furnishing of cars.

4

it arises basically under an Iowa negligence statute which

5

has nothing to do with national transportation policy, which

6

has nothing to do with the intercession of administrative

7

expertise, and it has none of the rubric of your ordinary

8

regulation-type case.

9

The facts:

But our approach is fairly narrow in that

basical]y, the Kale Brick £ Tile Company

10

which wa.s a family business, been in business for almost a

1 1

hundred years, had been served for 75 years by this same

12

rail line, had been served very well until i960 when the

13

Chicago North Western took it over.

14

only did the track begin to fail, but Kalo was not getting

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22

During the '60s, not

the switches, Kalo was not getting adequate cars -- they were
getting bad cars, they were getting all sorts of poor service.
They were promised better service but it never came.

And so,

consequently, through that period of time they were led to be­
lieve that things will be better, but they never got better.
Now/, the Court is obviously aware that the cause of
the failure of the railroad was because of impending water
along the side of the tracks.

In April of '73

the track

became impassable, and then in August Kalo because it required
23

railroad transportation to be competitive in its business,
24

sold its assets and went out of business.
25

33

And it wasn't until

1

three months after that, that finally the application for a

2

certificate of convenience and necessity was filed with the

3

Interstate Commerce Commission.

4

Now, our point, going back again to the Iowa negli­

5

gence statute, is this: that tort became, that stale court tori:

6

action became complete on the day when the damage existed.

7

And I think that's genera], negligence law.

8

and the damages, if any, were established in August,

9

bit of time prior to the time that the railroad made applica­

Now, we submit, Your Honors -QUESTION:

Mr. Blackburn, for a time did Kalo trans­

port its interstate shipments by truck?
MR. BLACKBURN:

There was, Your Honor, yes, a short

period of time when alternate facilities were offered by truck,
to the landing dock, to the railhead, or whatever, but that
simply did not work out.
QUESTION:

I think that --

Did not work out financially?

MR. BLACKBURN:

And I think physically it does not

woi'k out, because you get a certain amount of jiggling and
20

there's a special way of packing bricks, as I understand it,
21

and loading and unloading and so forth.
22

We submit that it was- not -- no matter what might be

said about the preemption statutes, and the cases that inter­

was

It's basically hornbook law.

It commences from the duty to exercise reasonable care.

QUESTION:
MR.

Yes, Your Honor.

And that gives you no problem?

BLACKBURN:

It gives me no problem to this ex­

20

tent, that I think it creates a -- let .me analogize to another
21

area of modern tort law.

The emergence in the last 20 years

22

or 25 years of products liability litigation has caused
23

manufacturers to recognize their duties and their obligations
24

to the consumers.

Now, I don't think there are very many

25

36

1

people except perhaps some manufacturers who would not say

2

that that has a salutory and good effect.

3

same thing would happen in this kind of case.

4

in this case, I think, in this country, I think everyone

5

would admit are in bad condition.

6

scheme since 1887 which has not cured those conditions.

7

Now, we're simply saying that the state tort claim would put

8

the pressure on the railroads to make those decisions rather

9

than to let the railroads fall by neglect and what we term

abandonment by neglect.
QUESTION:

Well, are you saying then, that's a pro­

ducts liability theory?
MR. BLACKBURN:

No, I'm not suggesting that.

I'm

simply saying that that's an analogy that the products liabil­
ity cases have, caused manufacturers to recognize their duties.
QUESTION:

But those have been generated largely by

state court fashioning of tort law remedies.

Here vie. have con­

gressional statutes that govern us and we aren't free to de­
part from them.
MR. BLACKBURN:

Except, Your Honor, that we're say­

20

ing that the way this case is pleaded it's not pleaded within
21

those federal guidelines.

The case was pleaded as a state

22

court case.

T think the best case in support of our theory,

23

and it doesn't get to the question of primary jurisdiction
24

or preemption, is the case of Johnson against Chicago,
25

37

1

Milwaukee, and St.' Paul, out of the 9th Circuit, which is a

2

diversity case.

that we're talking about here.

And the court reached some of these issues

1 1

it was taken out of a rate section, which was 22, which defined

12

rates, and it was given special emphasis by giving it a spe­

13

cial section.
We also suggest, Your Honor, that the law as pronounced

14

15

by this Court in the case cited by the petitioner, Jones v.

16

Rath Packing Company, is that there is an assumption against

17

purpose otherwise.

We do not contend that there

There are no federal track maintenance sta.nda.rds.

]

The only way that Kalo could get into federal court would be,

2

under this theory, would be via diversity action, which would

3

call upon the district court to grant original jurisdiction.

4

Any claim --- and we concede -- any claim that is made under

5

the Act must be made through the Commission, and then referred

6

to the federal court, or if it's brought in federal court, I

7

would agree with the question that was previously asked that

8

it probably must be referred to the Commission.
But that overlooks our theory of the case.

9

Our

10

theory, the federal act, the federal Interstate Commerce Act,

11

does not encompass negligent track maintenance.

12

is narrow but it's viable under the decisions of this Court,

13
14

15
16

and we know of no case which overrules the Puritan case.

19

said on several occasions that it did not favor’ implied over­
ruling of cases.
But in any event our theory is based upon negligent
track maintenance and there's nothing about that theory which
imposes or incites a federal rule or a federal statute.
Now, one of the theories that the Railroad would

20

21

It's

never been expressly overruled, and I think this Court has

17

18

Our theory

have us follow is, if you're harmed, you seek injunction.
Well, Your Honors, in this case, injunction was not an adequate:

22

remedy.

It would be foolish for the Ka2o people to spend

23

their then inadequate resources to enjoin the abandonment of
24

a. railroad that had already failed, and for which they'd been
25

39

1

told that it wasn't going to be rebuilt.

2

theory, which they would have us follow, is a very narrow

theory.

If the Interstate Com­

merce Commission had no primary jurisdiction -- in other words,
if this does not involve questions of national transportation
policy, if it does not require the administrative expertise to
solve this problem, if it is of a kind of problem that can
be handled by the convent.ional wisdom of judges, then the ICC
has no primary jurisdiction, unless it's found somewhere else
withi.n the statute.

And under our theory, once again, we'd

say it's not found anywhere else in the statute.
22

So if there is no primary jurisdiction, there is no

collateral estoppel.

And there’are other'reasons for denying

24

collateral estoppel in this case.

First, there are policy

Kalo had no incentive to go to Washington to be in­

It was out of business.

Court also announced the Fairness Doctrine in the. Parklane
Hosiery case, and we call your specific attention to Note. 15
of that case, which sets forth the fact that it may oftentimes
be unfair to call a party out cf and come to a foreign forum
to litigate issues which are beyond the reach of its own

20

discovery procedures and so forth.
21

I also call the Court's attention to the general rule
22

of the restatement of judgments which is now in a tentative,
23

draft fourth edition, which says, in the case of a. judgment

Finally, Your Honors, with regard to the question

5

of collateral estoppel or res judicata, or issue preclusion,

6

we suggest that -- and writers have suggested that there is a

general

gants to overtry their cases and therefore you get a

9

reverse-adverse effect, because the reason for the collateral

fear that overuse of issue preclusion will cause liti­

10

estoppel rule in the first place is to preserve the judicial

1 1

economy and not extend it.
Also, Your Honors, I would suggest that collateral

12
13

estoppel should never be used as a trap for the unwary.
Once again, Your Honors, we would suggest that

14

15

an affirmance of the Iowa Court of Appeals would provide a

16

check against abandonment by neglect, and a balancing process

17

between the regulated, the regulator, and the public.
