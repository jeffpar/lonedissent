the lessee of an economic interest in the minerals in place

so that the lessee is not entitled to the depletion deduction

The facts of all three cases are virtually identical

Mr. Justice Blackmun, and we think it's a little late in the

MR. SMITH:

’■ .

A

A GCM is an old form of ruling called

GCMs.
And this is a classic statement in the

depletion area because what it did was, to permit lessees like

10

an

11

lease -- the lease had to be for more than a nominal period.

12

It could only be terminable on more than nominal notice, and

13

the Service announced in that case that generally one year was

14

the rule.

15

more recently -- as a matter of fact, I can cite the Court to

16

two Revenue Rulings that I think bring this matter up to date:

17

Revenue Ruling 74-506 and 74-507, which were cited at 1974-2,

74-506 deals wi1h phosphate

What are those, GCMs?
No, these are Revenue Rulings.
Does the Service take the position that

one year is the cut-off line on every type of case?
MR. SMITH:

No.

The Service takes the position that

21

one year is the general rule of thumb,

22

the general principle is that the taxpayer has to have, the

23

right to mine the deposit to exhaustion in order to have an

24

economic interest in minerals i.n place.

25

QUESTION:

and

the"

taxpayer

You might have an allowable depletion
8

1

allowance deduction of, say, 25 percent and that would be

2

based upon the presumption that the asset is going to be ful]y

3

depletable in four years.

4

depletion allowance deduction of ten percent, which would be

5

based upon the presumption that the asset is going to be fully

6

depletable in ten years.

7

MR. SMITH:

You might have an allowable

And this rate is one year.

The coal rate is ten percent, and these

8

twro rulings that I've adverted to, which talk about the one-

9

year rule, are in the context of coal.

10

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Smith, the one year isn't based

11

on the anticipated period of mining out a coal seam, is -it:?

12

That has nothing to do with the ten-year presumed life of --

13

MR. SMITH:

No, that's simply a rate that's nego­

14

tiated between industries and the Congress, I think, and the

15

Treasury.

MR. SMITH:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SMITH:

20

QUESTION:

You mean the. one-year is?
No, no.
Or the ten-year?
The rates in the Code.
Yes, but what I'm saying, the one-year is

21

not related to any prediction about how long it takes to

22

exhaust a coal mine; maybe ten years would be.

23

MR. SMITH:

Well, but it's a general rule of thumb

24

that if you had -- basically, since the general principle

25

is that you have to have something substantial , you haive to
9

1

have a capital interest in minerals in place.

2

say, you know, if you have like a one- -- a right to do some­

3

thing for one day, it wouldn't be a terribly significant right.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

And simply to

There aren't very many coal mines that

operate for one day, are there?
MR. SMITH:

NO, but in fact, the rhetorical question

7

that the Court of Claims asked in Bakertown about it, saying

8

that this i.s not a one-day case, apparently there is a case

9

now pending before the Court of Claims involving a one-day

10

termination in turquoise mining.

11

is that in order to have this right to mine a dep>osit to ex­

12

haustion -- and it's basically what the Court talked about in

13

Paragon and in Parsons.—

14

QUESTION:

But anywTay, the basic p>oint

From the point of view of the Government's

15

interest, I mean, the whole purpose of a depletion allowance,

16

what difference does it make to the Government whether --

17

say it takes 20 years to mine out a coal, or ten years to

18

exhaust a coal mine, what difference would it make if there

19

were 20 different operators, each of whom succeeded one

20

another at six-month, intervals or ten at one-year intervals ,

21

or one for working the whole 20 years?

22

same amount of coal being mined and depleted and the same rea­

23

son for the depletion allowance, regardless of the period that

24

the lease, is in effect?

MR. SMITH:

Why isn't there the

Well, simply, Mr. Justice Stevens,

Exactly, exactly.

But there are a lot

6

of people involved in mining operations, extracting of miner­

7

als who have, something much less than an economic interest

8

to satisfy.
QUESTION:

9
10

But only one person has a right to sell

the coal.
MR.

11

SMITH:

Only one person has a right to sell the

12

coal, but indeed, in Parsons and in Paragon, the taxpayers

13

before, the court

14

bear very heavily on the question before the Court --

15

those cases the miners there were the only persons who had the

16

right to have the coal, and the Court held that they didn't

17

get the depletion allowance because they didn't satisfy the

18

economic interests.

19

They didn't have the right to sell the

They had to sell it to the lessor at a fixed price.

MR.

those are the two decisions that we think

coal.

SMITH:

They mined on a contract.
Exactly.

But they were selling the

Here, of course -- that's true; they did have the

11

1

right to sell the coal to anyone they pleased, at any price.

2

But we submit that the terminability clause, that that right

3

has to be viewed in the context of the terminability clause.

4

It's simply like saying, I have a five-year lease on an

5

apartment' and my landlord -QUESTION:

6

I don't think you're responding to my

7

question.

In terms of tax policy, say you have a 20-year life

8

of a mine and one, say one person was going to mine it out and

9

get the full depletion allowance.

What difference does it

10

make to the. government whether one person does it for 2 0 years

11

four people do it

12

three months?

13

MR.

for five years each, or 40 people do it for

SMITH:

I don't think it makes any difference,

14

but essentially, the reason this case is hex'e, in order to

15

have the Court announce a rule that both lessors and lessees

16

and the

17

now stand, in the Court of Claims the rule is one way, and

18

in the 3rd Circuit the rule is another.

19

Treasury will honor as the uniform rule.

QUESTION:

20

as you get a ruling?

21

MR. SMITH:

As matters

You don’t care how it's decided, so long

Well, I'd like to — I would not stand

22

here and tell you that this was an overwhelmingly important,

23

question of tax policy, except to the extent that the Bar

24

and the Treasury depend upon the application of uniform rules,

25

and we think that the uniform rule in this case ought to be
12

1

that the; termination clause should be regarded as a powerful

2

right against which all other rights must be; subordinated.

3

And indeed, this concept is not foreign to the tax law

4

Although the respondent suggests that this is a terrible

5

thing that the Treasury is imposing upon this in the a_,ea of

6

trusts, in the area of estate taxes, the right to revoce or

7

the right to pull bad something is extremely important, and

8

we submit that here, where the lessor has the right to cancel

9

a lease without any cause at all, essentially saying, get out

10

in 30 days, really reduces these respondents to having nothing

11

more than a right to mine an additional 3 0 days of coaL.

12

QUESTION:

Well, of course, in these cases, naybe at

13

doesn't fit the theory, but certainly the cutting edge of the

14

cases are these:

19

in Swank, if the operator doesn't get the

So the government benefits.

In the other two, I think the facts are that each
operator mined to exhaustion.
MR. SMITH:

Well, if each operator -- okay.

Well,

20

I think that the fact that Swank, that the lessor in S-rank

21

is a municipality or a county is simply a fortuity and I'm

22

not really sure that the depreciation --

QUESTION:

If it weren't for the Government's advan­

24

tage, just as in the old days when a taxpayer tried tc prove

25

the year of loss of a bad debt., he; always guessed wrong.
13

1

MR. 'SMITH:

Fight.

Well, the answer, I suppose, is

2

to have appropriate counsel and claim it in a variety of years

3

so that when it gets disallowed in one year you don't lose it

4

completely.

I understand it, is a tradeoff that says, you don't get per­

12

would if you were in oil cr a variety of other minerals but

13

you'll get capital gains treatment and, you know, correspond­

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Smith, can I summarize it just to be

16

sure I have it right? If you had the 20-year lease-situation, the

17

lessor would get both capital gains treatment and cost deple-

18

tion?

19

MR.

20

QUESTION:

21

SMITH:

Right.
And he would get that in this case

regardless of how we. decide it?

22

MR.

SMITH:

Right; that's right.

23

Well, getting back to what I think is sort of germane

24

here, and that is, on the question of the importance of the

25

terminability provision, in Parsons, like this case, there were
19

1

clear1 and explicit termination clauses in the contracts.

2

But in Paragon, the importance of terminability to the Court

3

was so significant that the Court implied

4

cn the behalf of the lessors, on the fact that the contractors

5

could have walked off at any time.

6

QUESTION:

a termination right

But wouldn't you agree, Mr.

Smith, that

there wouldn't have been an economic interest on the part of

MR. SMITH:

Well, that is true, that is true, because

But in our view, and I think that, really, this

is the important thing, that I

couldn't agree with you more,

that if you can't sell the coal to anyone you please but you
have to sell it to the lessor, you really are a kind of glori­

15

fied coal miner.

16

tion on 30 days' notice without cause is an equally important

17

right that subordinates the whole thing, because it. basically

18

says, the whole deal, I can nullify the whole deal anytime I

19

want.

20

those binds of restraints you don't really have much of a deal

21

anymore than you would if you had to sell the coal to the

22

lessor.

23
24
25

But it seems to me that the right of termina­

And it seems to me that if you are operating under

It seems to me that both those fa.ctcrs are of equal

weight.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, do you see any tension or

inconsistency between Parsons and Paragon?
20

1

MR. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR.

SMITH:

Do I see any?
Yes..
No.

No.

It seems to me that Paragon

4

follows the rule of Parsons.

And indeed, that was one of the

5

points I wanted to make.

6

points that the respondents make and the Court of Claims made

7

is that, well, it's very nice to talk about termination and

8

the terminability, but that's really a wholly theoretical thing

9

arid here nobody terminated.

It seems to me that one of the other

What does that matter?

It's kind

10

of instructive --- I was reading the dissent in Parsons, in

11

Paragon this morning, and the dissent made much the same com­

12

plaint that the respondents do here in which the Court of

13

Claims -- It's incredible that no one has sort of made the

14

analogy that the same complaint -- the Court fries to assimi­

15

late this case to Parsons by stating that Paragon could have

16

terminated the interest of the operators.

17

facts are really that Pairagon never gave the slightest intima­

18

tion that it might terminate anyone' s contract, and in au-r view

19

it's the right to terminate that's important, because deple­

20

tion and the allowances that flow from these mining contracts

21

necessarily have to turn on the rights.

22

be administered in accordance with the rights'that the parties

23

set forth in their contracts.

I take it, Mr.

MR.

SMITH::

Yes, in our view it does equate.

They

are equivalents for these purposes.

4

there aren't property law distinctions but I think the

to take a back seat to the governing principles in this area.

MR. KATZ:

No, there's no such regulation as that,

they are just an opinion from the General Counsel's Office

Mr. Smith that I had never heard of GCM.

There are lots of

parts of the Tax Court I've never heard of too, but you say
they don't have the force of a regulation?

Now, I also want to call the. Court'

"No depletion deduction" -- no depletion deduction

-- "shall be. allowed the owner with respect to any coal" --

7

I'm leaving out the other minerals -- "that such owner has

8

disposed of under any form of contract by virtue of which he

9

retains an economic interest in such coal,

10

11

if such disposal

is considered a sale of the coal under Section 631(c)."
Now, how he can say that they are going to get some

12

depletion, the owner, under 631 is beyond me, because I'm just

13

reading it right cut of the book.

QUL'STION:

Mr. Katz, I understood Mr. Smith to be

saying that he was referring, not to

16

but rather tc what he: called a "cost depletion," which as I

17

understand it is really nothing more them the cost in any

percentage depletion,

QUESTION:

required to bring the coal to the lessee's tipple.

3

required to give it to the lessee who then in turn sold it,

4

and who was responsible for what happened on the market, whe­

5

ther he made money or whether he lost irnoney.

6

of that, the contractor, this Court said, was not entitled to

7

any depletion allowance. They didn't base it on the termina-

bility.

because all he was doing was getting Daid for work which he

It wasn't the theory that they' later

QUESTION:

I mean, this Court

In order to have any depletion allowance

Yes, that's correct.

That is exactly

correct.

15

to what my opponent has stated here, Your Honor, we feel that

the percentage depletion allowance should be given to us.

17

And in this case, it's ten percent, but it's not

ten percent flat.

It's ten percent of the gross income

So that is what it is.

Contra.ry

The Government is not injured because the Congress

18

has told us we are entitled to that depletion.

Your Honor, if I may make this point, it doesn't make any

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT BY STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

16

MR. SMITH:

17

As I understand why the GCM which has been bandied

I just have a couple of points.

18

about today has been rendered obsolete, it's simply because

19

it's been subsumed in other

20

Court's decisions in Parsons and in Paragon, and in the rul­

21

ings which I cited today.

22

decided on the basis of notions that Congress enacted the

23

depletion deduction.

24

I think that what we have to decide is whether these respon­

25

dents have an economic interest in coal in place.

QUESTION:

And in our view, that is not

And then, in your view, the fact that

MR. SMITH:

You cannot
