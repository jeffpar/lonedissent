ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The Court granted certiorari in this case to review

10

two questions.

11

stripped of its right to appeal whenever a state criminal

12

prosecution is removed by the defendant to federal district

13

dourt pursuant to the Federal Removal Statute.

14

The first is whether a state government is

The second question on which review was granted was

15

whether a federal district court has jurisdiction to enter

16

judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(c) on its own motion

18
19

20
21

22

beyond the seven-day limit called for in Rule 29(c), in this
case 11 months after a jury has returned a guilty verdict.
This case arose out of a shooting that took place in
Southern Arizona in March, 1976.

Respondent Manypenny was

employed as a United States border patrol agent.

While he was

on duty taking aliens into custody near the Mexican border
he shot an unarmed alien in the back as the alien was heading

back towards Mexico..

MR. SMITH:

Nos, we didn't petition on that issue,

Your Honor, and the 9th 'Circuit did not address it.
A divided 9th 'Circuit held that the state has no

4

right to appeal when a state criminal prosecution is removed

2

to federal court, irrespective of whether that state has the

3

right to appeal in its own courts.

found that both 18 U.S.C. 3731 provided the Court of Appeals

5

with a basis for hearing the case;

6

the alternative 28 U.S.C. 1291, which provides for review of

7

all final decisions in the district courts, would also give

8

the 9th Circuit jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

Judge Kennedy's dissent further examined the merits

of the case and he stated that he would reverse the judgment

12

noted in its opinion that the concerns of Congress that led to

13

the enactment of 3731 are equally applicable to removed state

14

criminal prosecution.

15

would have a substantial effect on the delicate balance of

16

our federal system.

17

Even the majority

They further stated that their decision

18

court in the country with unreviewable power to block any

19

state criminal prosecution of a federal removal defendant.

20

21

23
24

25

It creates a specially privileged class of defendants in
federal court who can enjoy the unreviewable benefits of judi­
cial errors committed in their favor, and it will serve to
encourage forum shopping.
The Solicitor General filed an amicus brief at the
request of this Court.

They took the position that both
5

2

jurisdiction to hear the State's appeal and they further stated

3

that the policy considerations that led to the enactment of

4

the removal statute in the first place are in no way furthered

5

by the decision of the 9th Circuit which simply gave a windfall

6

benefit to removal defendants.
QUESTION:

8

1291 gave the Court of Appeals

The removal statute is a fairly old

statute, isn't it?
MR.

9

SMITH:

Yes.

Its history is traced in this

10

Court's opinion in Willingham v. Morgan.

1 1

back to 1812, and then it was allowed to lapse for a long while

12

and was revived after the Civil War.
QUESTION:

13

It apparently goes

And of course, even after it was revived,

14

as of that time there was no appeal in a criminal case for

Certain state courts allowed appeals

but -QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

I mean, in a federal?
In federal court there wasn't any right

to an appeal until 1907.
QUESTION:

Right, for either.

QUESTION:

In a capital case there was no right to

appeal in the federal courts before 1907, was there?
MR.

SMITH:

No, and I think the Sanges case of this

Court states that prior to the late 1880s there wasn't even an
6

1

2
3
4

appeal by a defendant in federal court; nobody had a right to.
QUESTION:

Well, that's what I, meant, that a defen­

dant prior to 1900 in a capital case could appeal.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I'm not familiar with that, but I

5

know that there was no general right to appeal for a defendant

6

prior to the act that was construed in Sanges.

7

This Court in

Younger v. Harris stated that, "Since the beginning of our

8

nation's history Congress has manifested a desire to let

9

state courts try state cases free from interference by federal

10

courts, subject to a few sharply delineated exceptions."

1 1

In Colorado v. Symes, which was a 1932 removal case

12

before this Court, the Court stated that the right of a state

13

government to enforce its criminal laws is equal to the right

14

of the federal government, and that the removal statute before

15

the Court had to be construed

16

that equality.

In Tennessee v. Davis, which was the seminal case in
removal jurisprudence -- that was an 1880 decision by this
Court, the Court set forth the rule that for the trial of
removal cases the federal district courts are to apply the
substantive law of the states and the procedural law of the
federal courts.

And this was codified in Rule 54(b)(1) and

the comment to Rule 54(b)(1) makes it explicit that in the
intended removals of prosecution, the state government stands
in the shoes of the United States Government for procedural
7

1

purposes.

2

Arizona law allows for appellate review in the cir­

cumstances of this case, irrespective of whether the Court

deems the right to appeal by the sovereign to be substantive

or procedural; the State of Arizona -QUESTION:

1 1

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Yes.
At that time that case was decided, there

was removal jurisdiction to the federal court and

14

view that there was an appeal allowable at that time?

15

MR. SMITH:

is it your

At

16

that time, it would be our position that had the state govern­

17

ment provided for the right to appeal in its own courts and

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

were the right to appeal deemed substantive rather than pro­
cedural, then there would have been a right to appeal under
Tennessee v. Davis, but that never arose.
QUESTION:

Even if there was no right of appeal to

the United States in a federal prosecution?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, if Davis is applied literally,

that would have been the case.

But again, that's not before

this Court because -25

QUESTION:

Well, somehow or other the Tennessee

v. Davis got to this Court, so somebody must have appealed it.

3

MR. SMITH:

Well, in Tennessee v. Davis, it got to

this Court prior to trial where the State of1 Tennessee was

challenging the constituionality of the Removal Act itself.

MR. SMITH:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SMITH:

By what sort of procedure?
I would assume by writ of mandamus.
I see.
I haven't re read the case recently, so I don't know either.
But the State of Tennessee raised two

12

contentions.

One, they contended that removal was per se

13

unconstitutional, and I obviously didn't read the briefs on

14

that case but I think some of the history that I cited in my

15

opening brief would lay the basis for that.

16

by the Court.

That was rejected

The second contention was that Congress in enacting

17

18

the removal statute had not provided for any explicit procedure

19

for the trial of removal cases, which is very similar to the

20

objection that respondent raised in this case, that there's no

21

explicit authorization for a removal appeal in a removal case.
This Court rejected that as being a frivolous

22
23
24

25

argument.

They said that the mode of trial was sufficiently

obvious, and federal courts are equipped to set forth that
rule .
9

QUESTION:

the substantive aspects?

3

MR. SMITH:

4

QUESTION:

5

But it also said that state law governed

Yes.
And is it your position that appealability

is a substantive matter, to be controlled by state law?
MR. SMITH:

6

Your Honor, we haven't taken a position

7

on that issue because the State of Arizona, which is the only

8

statd

9

type of situation.

I'm representing today, does provide for appeals in this
However, under Arizona State law,

10

the right to appeal is a substantive right, although the

1 1

mode that appeal takes is considered procedural.

12

that shouldn't govern in this Court.

Obviously,

13

QUESTION:

14

position you take, I suppose.

15

United States position is that Arizona could appeal in a

16

removed case even if it couldn't appeal in its own courts.

17

Is that right or not?

18
19

20

25

It makes quite a bit of difference what
I suppose the result of the

MR. SMITH: I think that was the position the
Solicitor General took, although they noted -QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Is that your position?
Well, after I've reiterated the fact

that it's unnecessary for the disposition of this case, it
would be our position —
QUESTION:

I know, but you have to -- you just can't

say, reverse, or append, at the bottom.
10

You have to say, why.

1

2

So what is your theory of appealability?
MR. SMITH:

Well, under most of the case law that

3

I've read, substantive law defines what is a crime and the

4

punishment for a crime, and procedure governs how that result

5

Is supposed to be reached.

systems, different controls, direct and indirect, over the

MR. SMITH:

It would be our position that be­

Do you rely on 1291, or -- ?
Well, we would rely both on 3731, which

1 1

provides, Subsection (e), that the provisions of this statute

12

shall be liberally . construed to effectuate its purposes.

13

purposes of 3731 --

14

QUESTION:

Then you would apparently say that

15

Arizona could appeal under that statute even if it couldn't

appeal in its own courts?

MR. SMITH:
with that, situation.
QUESTION:

That would be our position, were we facec
But again, the State of Arizona isn't.
Well, I know, but if we decide on that

ground, why then we are deciding that Arizona could appeal in
a federal court, even if it couldn't in its state court.

But

if you relied on 1291 and said state law determines it -- ?
MR. SMITH:

No, we're also relying on 1291 under

the basis of the literal language of 1291.
QUESTION:

Then you're saying that the state is just

a party that can appeal?

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

8

10
1 1

12

If the Court's going to base its deci­

sion on 1291, that would --

7

9

Wholly aside from whether it could appeal

in its own courts?

5

6

Yes.

Well, why are you citing Tennessee then?
Because one of Respondent's arguments is

that Congress never explicitly provided for this situation,
and it would be our position that because Tennessee v. Davis
was decided in 1880, 27 years before the first criminal
appeals act was passed in 1907 -QUESTION:

So you don't really care about Tennessee's

13

holding that state substantive law governs?

It'S the-'other

14

aspect of it that the federal system has all you need to try
15

the case?
16

QUESTION:

Well, as I understood your argument,

17

Mr. Smith, it was this, that you don't need, and we don't need
18

to decide whether this is procedural or substantive under
19

Tennessee v. Davis, since Arizona has a right of appeal under
20

state law, in any event, and you say that the federal statute
21

gives Arizona a right of appeal under federal law, in any
22

event ?
23

MR. SMITH:

Right.

That's --

24

QUESTION:

So whether it's substantive or procedural.

25

12

1

in your plan Arizona wins.'

2

MR. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

That'S your theory?

That's our theory.
In a diversity case that's removed to

4

federal court from state court, that's just a simple civil

5

action, the federal statute controls the appealability of

6

that, doesn't it?
MR. SMITH:

7

Well, if the Court's asking about the

8

Erie Doctrine, this isn't a classic diversity case.

12

tion which was filed in the Superior Court of Pima County and

13

properly removed by the defendant to the district court of

14

Arizona, and after judgment one of the parties wants to appeal.

15

He looks to the federal statutes governing appeal to the Court

16

of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, does he not?
MR. SMITH:

25

with the civil law,

Supposing you simply had a civil ac­

I would think, again -- I'm not familiar
but

oh

the

Erie

question,,

which., is

useful by analogy, I would request that the Court consider the
late Chief Justice Warren's opinion in Hanna

v.

Plumer,

in

which he said that the twin policies of the Erie Doctrine,
were

to

discourage

forum

shopping

and to the avoidance

of the inequitable administration of justice.

And I would sub­

mit that both those, policy considerations are undercut by the
decision of the 9th Circuit and would be furthered by a ruling
13

1

from this Court that a state does retain its right to appeal,

2

when a criminal prosecution is removed.

3

In United States v. Wilson, which was the case where

4

this Court interpreted the modern version of 3731, per Justice

5

Marshall, wrote that "the congressional intent behind the

6

amendment was to eliminate all statutory barriers to government

7

appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would

8

permit.

9

there is no right to benefit from a judicial error: committed in

And as Mr. Justice Marshall noted in that opinion,

10

your favor, when that can be reviewed without subjecting the

1 1

defendant to a second trial.

12

this case, even if Tennessee v. Davis didn't; unless the Court's

13

going to retreat from the language in Wilson that it does, ther

14

is no statutory barrier to this appeal, and therefore it's

15

authorized under 3731.

16
17

18
19

20
21
22
23

24

We submit that Wilson controls

In the alternative -QUESTION:

Well, just so I have your argument --

if it's authorized under 3731, you are arguing that the State
of Arizona should be treated as "The United States" within the
meaning of 3731?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And not be permitted to appeal except

where 3731 would permit the United States to appeal?
MR. SMITH.:

Well, if the appeal rights of the State

again are to be predicated on 3731, that would be logical that
25

14

1

we would have the same rights as the United State Government,

2

were prosecution commenced by the United States Government.

3
4

QUESTION:

Or the absence of such rights as they do

not have?
MR. SMITH:

5

Yes.

That would be simpler to adminis­

6

ter.

In the alternative, if this Court finds that the words

7

"United States" in 3731 do preclude that statute as being

8

used for the jurisdictional basis of this appeal, we submit

9

that 1291 should also be read literally and that this appeal

10

is plainly

authorized by the all-final decision language in

1 1

that statute.
QUESTION:

12

But if you take that view, then 3731

13

really wasn't necessary for the United States to have the right

14

to appeal.

except where expressly authorized by statute.
QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

22

24

25

In other words, prior decisions, it said

that 1291 doesn't cover appeals by the prosecution?

21

23

Court prior to the amendment of 3731 and Wil­

did hold that the United States Government couldn't appeal

19

20

Well, that's not so, because prior deci­

That's the general drift of the Court's
If that's the case, how can we now read

1291 to allow appeals when the State of Arizona is the prose­
cutor?
MR. SMITH:

Because now 1291 should be read in light

of the congressional amendment to 3731, which is the -QUESTION:

Well, then, you're still relying on 3731

as a necessary part of your 1291 argument?
HR. SMITH:

Yes,

In the 9th Circuit, in the

5

United States v. Hetrick,

6

September 16, that I sent to the Court several weeks ago, they

7

did hold that in light of the new construction of 3731, that

1291 did provide the basis for a government appeal in a crimi­

9

nal case, although that was an appeal by the United States

Government, not a state.
Unless there are any further questions on the first

issue, we would request that the Court not ratify the creation

of state sovereignty.

We urge the Court to hold that a state

16

On the second question presented --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

We'll never get to the second question if

we decide against you on the first, is that correct?
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

Although the second issue can still

20

be reviewed and considered pursuant to this Court's mandamus

21

jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1651, because mandamus, as this

22
23

24
25

Court's prior decisions have

held, does not lie where there

is an adequate remedy by appeal.

But if the Court decides the

first question adversely to Petitioner and the Court goes on
to find what this district court was wholly without
16

1

jurisdiction to have entered this order, then the 9th Circuit

2

and this Court both have jurisdiction to reinstate the verdict

3

pursuant to its mandamus jurisdiction.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if we decide in favor of you on the

5

first question it would seem to me that we would not reach the

6

second question.

7

the appeal and we should simply reverse the judgment of the

8

9th Circuit and send it back to the 9th Circuit.

9

The 9th Circuit shouldn't then have dismissec.

MR. SMITH:

Well, the Court could certainly do that.

10

On the other hand, we would submit there are several compelling

1 1

reasons why the Court ought to take the second issue.

QUESTION:

In any event we did grant certiorari on

both issues?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, and they were both fully briefed

below, in the courts below.

If Mr. Justice Rehnquist would

like the response, as to why we should take jurisdiction, I'll
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

No, you do the responding.
Okay. We would..submit that perhaps the

most compelling consideration for this Court not to remand it
to the 9th Circuit would be considerations of comity; that
this case is more than four years old, it's gone through four
prior decisions already, and we ' re in an extremely delicate area of
federal-state relations in removal jurisprudence.
Secondly,. Judge Kennedy in dissent stated that he
took a position in conflict with the 5th and 10th Circuits and

25

17

1

would find that the district court did have jurisdiction to con­

2

sider the untimely judgment of acquittal.

3

ly, that's a dissent and not controlling, under your super­

4

visory powers you know that you have a judge down below who's

5

on record as taking what we submit is a wrong position, and

6

that would be a further reason for this Court to consider the

7

second issue.

Had it been labeled a Rule 33 motion but had attacked the suf­
ficiency of the state's .avi.denee,, that would be a different
case, but that's not what happened here.
In United States v. Smith case, which dealt with
Rule 33 motions, this Court in 1948 held that virtually identi­
cal language was in fact jurisdictional and set forth several
policy reasons why the Rule should be literally enforced.

The

5th and 10th Circuits have both held that the seven-day limit
is in fact the jurisdictional limit, and we submit there is

no reason for this Court not to extend the identical ruling

that this Court did in the Smith case

since the identical relief can be obtained by this respondent or

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. WHITNEY, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WHITNEY:

3
4

5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think there is one fundamental difference and I

6

think this Court is going to have to resolve that difference

7

before the case makes any sense at all, and that is the con­

8

stant references by counsel to the appealability of a judgment

9

of acquittal under the

10
11

Arizona State Statutes.

There is no

such right.
Now, it was argued by Judge Kennedy in his dissent

12

that there was language talking about jurisdiction being

13

given to the state or to the appellate courts for states'

14

appeals in orders rendered after judgment.

15

well, perhaps loosely.

16

effect, what we have here is a judgment of acquittal.

One could say,

This is the legislature saying in

17

All right, that's a great argument until you read

18

those rights given to the defendant in the State of Arizona

19

to appeal, where they specifically state,

20
21

22
23
24

25

and

specifically

set forth judgments of acquittal.
So there is no right, and I would refer, please, to
pages 17 and 18 of our brief.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Whitney, I understand your col­

league to take the position that the State has the right to
appeal in the federal courts, whether they have the right to

pendent of whether there's a right to appeal In the state
courts or not.
MR. WHITNEY:

I hope that the Court takes that posi­

tion in rendering a decision, because it seems to me that we
have at least three grounds that counsel is proffering as a
basis for appeal, and the principal ground among those is that
appeal should be allowed not only by reason of the language
in 37 31 calling for. a liberal construction — I call the Court's
attention to the fact that the liberal construction applies

25

to this section,

I would point, sir, in the response to a petition for a writ
of certiorari, the estate of State v. Hunt, where the Arizona
appellate statute was almost identical to the one that we have
before us today.

And in State v. Hunt, the Court held unequivc

cally that there was no appeal from a judgment of acquittal.
It just said that the State Legislature had not seen fit to
so expressly provide.

25

23

And my argument is this, further, if I may go on.

1

2

My argument is that the Legislature was fully aware of the

importance of a judgment of conviction and chose to designate

appealability from a judgment of conviction in the case of a

Well, in that Congress has provided for

removal to a federal court when a federal officer is tried.
The state has set up a criminal prosecution system and provided
for appeal by the state in certain instances .

The Congress has

also provided for appeals from United States under the criminal
code.

petition of removal as required under statute at that time had

MR. WHITNEY:
QUESTION:

Maryland v. Soper, sir.

Thank you.

MR. WHITNEY:

are that in 1924 the Supreme Court of the United States had
found, they had to find, that the state in a removal action
had no right of appeal.

I doubt, reading the case, that had

they found that there was a right of appeal, that they would
have issued a mandamus quite as readily as they did.

recognized, citing ex parte Fahey, the reluctance of this

Yes, sir.

Did he discuss at all the appealability of

MR. WHITNEY:

He never went into it.

He just made it

He didn't go into the Maryland law as

I don't believe

and its rights to appeal.
QUESTION:

But at least that statute was enacted

after the Maryland v. Soper dicta, for a State?
MR. WHITNEY:

No question, sir; no question.

Now*, in Soper, as far as mandamus is concerned,
29

1

counsel has suggested that on the principles of comity,

2

federalism, and so forth, that this Court should issue a writ

3

of, or treat it in the nature of a writ of mandamus, apart

4

from the holdings in Soper and Fahey, where great caution is

5

given to this

Court

issuing writs of mandamus.

I'd like the Court, if it would please, to consider

6
7

its own rules as applies to mandamus.

And the necessities for a

8

petition, the language in that rule, the circumstances must be

9

exceptional, and matters of the like.

That is simply a repe­

10

tition of the language that has come to us through the

1 1

Arizona statutes and that's all been codified now in a section

And there's a verdict of acquittal.

10

Sir, I thought his question went to

No.

court afterward.
MR. WHITNEY:

I think Justice Rehnquist was saying,

12

let's turn this around and put the whole thing in the nature

13

of a federal prosecution, where you have a verdict of guilty,

14

the United States stepping -- the U.S. district court judge

judgment of acquittal.

20

22
23
24

I think Justice Rehnquist's question

then was, do you feel it would be appealable?

My response to

him was, and I'd just as soon not make it, but my response to
him is that probably under United States v. Wilson and the
United States v. Rojas, which is a 9th Circuit decision, in
the absence of jeopardy that there would be an appeal.
QUESTION:

court of appeals simply dismiss

the appeal if it found that there was double jeopardy?
25

32

1

However, whatever his question was, now that I’ve interrupted

2

you, do you make any double jeopardy claim in this case?

3

MR. WHITNEY:

We did, sir.

We did.

It was dismissed

4

once; the appeal was dismissed once on the basis of double

5

j eopardy.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WHITNEY:

8

Is that here?
No, sir.

Double jeopardy is not an

issue before this Court.
QUESTION:

9

So, I suppose it would be possible for

10

this Court to hold that the court of appeals was mistaken in

11

the ground that it gave, that there was no appeal allowed

12

whatsoever by Arizona, and then to remand the case for the

13

court of appeals to consider the appealability under the other

14

ground rules, including double jeopardy.

that the appeal was well taken, then to consider the substan­

Mr. Soper had not been to trial.

He had filed a removal

challenging the granting of the removal petition, which did
not happen in this case.

in Mr. Whitney's brief, it says, "the order of the United
States district judge in refusing to remand is not open to

is that if the case proceeds to trial without it being

3

considered on a mandamus by this Court, should the jury come

4

back, "not guilty," or if he knows that he's prior to Wilson,

5

perhaps if the judge entered a judgment of acquittal, that was

6

considered nonreviewable back then, that the state was out of

luck, so if they don't consider it on mandamus prior to trial,

And it really has no application to this case other

12

13

than the statement that appears further in that case which I

14

cited in either my brief or my petition, where Mr. Chief

Justice Taft says that in removal cases the use of mandamus

16

would be more liberally applied than in normal cases.

And to

that extent that the Court feels it necessary to reach the
mandamus issue in resolving this, we would submit that Mary­
land v. Soper is authority that this Court ought to grant our
petition

for mandamus.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, let me go back to Maryland.

I may have missed something, but it seems to me that the
Court was saying

that there can be no appeal by the State of

Maryland after the trial is over if Maryland loses it?
MR. SMITH:

No, he just said in that that there

25

35

1

would be no appeal from a judgment 0;f acquittal and it' s hot clear

2

from the opinion whether he's talking about a postverdict judgment

3

of acquittal.

4

from a jury verdict of acquittal taking place in the federal

5

district court, because Maryland v. Soper had not proceeded to

6

trial at the time that this Court considered it upon mandamus.

It would be morb reasonable to assume he meant

there would have been an appeal from some kinds of

1 1

acquittals. Then it might have been that mandamus would have

12

been appropriate, wouldn't it?

MR. SMITH:

Well, but that wasn't in Maryland v.

Soper, and it's more like it's dicta coming out of it in a

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

That was true in 1924.

There was

no right to appeal.
QUESTION:

But what the case holds is -- and also,

there's no possibility of a posttrial appeal. That never did -MR. SMITH:'
QUESTION:

It didn't say that.
Well, if it didn't say that, why was

mandamus necessarily appropriate then?
36

Because then, at the

very end of the proceeding, it might have theoretically been

2

possible to review the removal order.

Well, if the jury had come back "not

guilty," it would have been moot to review the propriety of -QUESTION:

At that point there conceivably could

12

Well, that's theoretically possible but

Maryland v. Soper was on removal only.
That's what I thought.

It wasn't on the

merits.
MR. SMITH

That's all-it was about.

It had nothing

to do with the -QUESTION:

The Court did cite United States v.

Sanges, in saying that there would be no appeal by the state
after verdict, didn't it?
MR. SMITH:
Mr. Whitney.

Well, that's not in the quotation from

If that's what it says, that's what it says.
37

1

But again, Sanges was decided in 1892, long prior to the

2

current version of 3731, and we're dealing with not only a

3

different procedural posture, but a completely different

4

statute.
The other thing I wanted to address was Mr. Whitney's

5

6

comments that Arizona law does not provide for appellate

7

review in the circumstance.

8

of our opening brief, and that Judge Kennedy cited in his

9

dissent at pages 23 through 24a and 38a of the petition,

The cases that we cite on page 34

10

clearly hold that in certain circumstances, including where a

1 1

judgment of acquittal has been entered by a superior court

12

judge, which is the equivalent of a district court judge, an

appeal can lie.

That's

a

verdict

of

"guilty."

A judgment N.O.V., is that what you're talking about?
MR. SMITH:

Well, there are two cases where it was

addressed by appeal.

One is State v. Gradillas, which is at

544 Pacific 2d 1111.

The judgment of acquittal was entered at

17

18

That issue wasn't even squarely addressed,

a motion to suppress, which was not the posture in this case.
That was set aside on appeal without any discussion of the
jurisdictional aspects.

But in State v. Allen, which is also

cited by Judge Kennedy, that's at 557 Pacific 2d 176, there was
a

jury, verdict of guilty.

It was set aside by the trial court

and in an untimely manner.
25

38

1

That case first went up to the State Supreme Court

2

on petition for special action, which is roughly equivafent to

3

mandamus but not exactly the same thing.

Court remanded it at -- reversed that and said that was

5

untimely and sent it back.

entered a motion in arrest of judgment on the grounds that

insufficient evidence had been adduced by the state to rebut

MR. SMITH:

Honor.

What about State v. Hunt, Mr. Smith?
I'm not familiar with that case, Your

But there are several other cases that were cited by

Judge Kennedy as well as the case that I sent in on the supple­
mental petition for certiorari, State v. Superior Court at
606 Pacific 2d 411, where the Arizona Supreme Court vacated
the untimely entry of a judgment of acquittal, essentially the
exact same facts of this case, by special action.
And if you read the "special action" statute which
I've cited, Sub-3 in my opening brief, in conjunction with
these cases where it's been granted by appeal, it's plain that
39

1

any order that doesn't violate -- any appellate review that

2

doesn't violate double jeopardy is authorized by Arizona case

3

law and state statute.

4

And again, even if this Court might, reading the

5

state statutes, might read them differently, that's not for

6

this Court to do.

tional interpretation in the strict construction field which

anything about this case, that's all I've got.
