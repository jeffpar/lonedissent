ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. McCUTCHEON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. McCUTCHEON:

10

We'll hear arguments next

in Vincent v. Texas.

4

5

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before this Court on direct appeal

1 1

alleging the unconstitutionality of the Texas probation stat­

12

ute under the provisions of the decisions in Morrissey v.

13

Brewer and Gagnon v. Scarpelli, insofar as they relate to the

14

revocation of probation.

15

16

22

The issue in this case: Was Danny Vincent denied due
process of law by reason of the failure of the State of Texas
to grant him a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause
as soon as reasonably possible after his arrest?
QUESTION:

Now, you're going to tell us why that

wasn't swallowed up by the subsequent developments, aren't you1:
MR. McCUTCHEON:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Why that lack, assuming that there was a

lack, was not swallowed up and made irrelevant by the subse­
23
24

quent events?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

Yes, Your Honor.

25

3

1

In the first instance, the State is alleging that

2

the subsequent events were these:

3

the arresting officer that he was driving while intoxicated

4

and that was a sufficient admission of a crime under the

5

State of Texas which was a violation of his probation, there­

6

fore obviating the necessity for a preliminary hearing as to

7

due cause.

8

at the time and immediately after his arrest, and the probatior

9

officer observed him in an intoxicated state and concluded

number one, he admitted to

Secondly, he so admitted to his probation officer

10

from that that he had violated his probation conditions.

1 1

And third, that he was afforded a full-blown, evidentiary

12

judicial hearing at which the Court found that he had violated

13

his probation and that he had admitted on the stand that he

14

so violated it.

15

16

QUESTION:

And did he admit on the stand also that

he had on the spot conceded he was intoxicated?

17

MR. McCUTCHEON:

18

QUESTION:

19

he had said before?

MR. McCUTCHEON:
QUESTION:

I believe that's true.

Yes.

Well, what then can we do for your client?

We can't add 20 days to his life, presumably.
MR. McCUTCHEON:

In terms of whether or not there

was probable cause to hold him and whether this Court should
either send it back for that hearing, I would probably concede,
4

1

although that's what this Court did in Gagnon v. Scarpelli,

2

that that would be an irrelevant and useless situation.

I think the Court is faced with this situation of evidence.

QUESTION:

We did make --

But we haven’t complained about it.

-- would the preliminary hearing do you

MR. McCUTCHEON:

In terms of what it would actually

do, what would happen is, if you remanded it for that probable

6
7

But the constitutional effect is

Well, would not the practical effect --

tell me what the practical effect would be?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

8
9

So the practical

Well, the practical effect is, at

the time that he was arrested and at the time from that point

10

until he had a counsel appointed and was out on bail, he was

1 1

held without a determination of probable cause under this

12

Court's mandates.

13

years of history, there is not a whole lot that this Court can

14

do to rectify that violation of his probable cause.

15

the Court recognized that in Gerstein v. Pugh.

The fact of denying the hearing was attacked.

QUESTION:

What does Gerstein v. Pugh tell us about
6

1

that problem?

2

MR. McCUTCHEON:

Gerstein v. Pugh, the only way that comes

3

in is, what do you do with a conviction which is based upon

4

an improper detention or an arrest without probable cause?

5

And that has told me that this Court up to now has said, we

are not going to void that conviction.

8
9

10

Well, if we wouldn't void a conviction on

that ground, do you think we ought to void a parole revocation
on that ground?

1 1

MR. McCUTCHEON:

And then what would happen?

MR. McCUTCHEON:

his case or not.
MR. McCUTCHEON:

No.

QUESTION:

13

Do you think it's the function of this

14

Court to be handing out peppercorns or granting significant

relief?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

I think it's the function of this

Court to enforce the Gagnon v. Scarpelli and grant significantrelief insofar as Mr. Vincent is concerned, and I think in
terms of whether it's prospective or not, we're not talking
about a situation like Gagnon v. Scarpelli or Morrissey v.
Brewer.

Those cases have been on the books for eight years,

and the Texas Supreme Court has had three prior times to con­
sider those, and in each case -- the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals -- and in each case it said, no, it does not apply,
and we are not going to follow it.
9

And so it's not a situation of this Court pronouncing
some new constitutional law.

Did they say that in here?

QUESTION:

the Whisenant v. State case.

It was a per curiam decision without -And what did they say in the prior case?

MR. McCUTCHEON:

In the Whisenant case they said

1 1

that Gagnon v. Scarpelli does not apply to Texas probation

12

revocation proceedings for several reasons:

13

made the distinction earlier between the suspension of imposi­

14

tion of sentence and the suspension of execution; number two,

15

Texas procedure provides more due process than Gagnon v.

16

Scarpelli; and third, that the probationer is entitled to

17

a mandatory 20-day hearing, and that obviates the necessity,

18

they believed, for a preliminary determination from appellants.

QUESTION:

number one, we

Mr. McCutcheon, according to my recollec­

tion there was recently filed in this case a motion to dismiss
the appeal, based upon the proposition that your client had
escaped before his case was decided by the Court of Criminal
Appeals of Texas, and that therefore that court didn't have
any jurisdiction and that we don't.

Are you going to address

yourself, before you sit down, to that motion?
10

Am I right in

MR. McCUTCHEON:

Did you say you had information that we

had actually overruled that motion?
18

QUESTION:

Didn't we just postpone it to this —

19

MR. McCUTCHEON:

As I understood it, you're talking

20

about the motion to dismiss on escape?
21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

22

MR. McCUTCHEON:

As opposed to the original motion

23

to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
24

QUESTION:

No, no, this is a motion based on his

11

escape, on his alleged escape.

2

MR. McCUTCHEON:

I was informed by counsel for the

3

State this morning.

4

that that motion on escape, which was filed last week or so,

5

had already been overruled by this Court.
QUESTION:

MR. McCUTCHEON:

All I was told, that it had been

overruled.

QUESTION:

We postponed it to the merits.

QUESTION:

That had been my recollection but I was --

Where is your client?

MR. McCUTCHEON:

My client is in the: correctional facil­

ity in the State of Colorado .

He has been later subsequently con­

victed of forgery char'ges. The Appendix Set forth in the state's
motion to dismiss is substantially correct aS to what happehed.
QUESTION:

When was your last communication with him?

MR. McCUTCHEON:

Right after I received the State's

Motion to Dismiss on the grounds of escape.
25

12

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. McCUTCHEON:

This recent one?
Yes.

The State would have this

3

Court focus on -- and I think the Court of Criminal Appeals

4

has focused on the second stage in a probation revocation case,

5

and that is the determination of whether to revoke.

6

has not addressed nor has the Court of Criminal Appeals

7

addressed the first stage, that is, the requirement of a

8

hearing to determine probable cause.
QUESTION:

9

10

The State

Well, wasn't one of the conditions of his

probation to obey all the laws?

1 1

MR. McCUTCHEON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. McCUTCHEON:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

And he was picked up for drunken driving?
Yes.

And didn't either the arresting officer

15

or -- I forget if he was taken before a magistrate or not --

16

find there was probable cause to arrest him for drunken

17

driving?

18
19

20
21

22

MR. McCUTCHEON:

The officer made that determination

as he must do in all situations for arrest.

That, I don't

think, is what this Court was talking about in Gagnon v.
Scarpelli and Morrissey v. Brewer.

You were talking about a

disinterested person.
QUESTION:

What admissions if any did your client

23
24

make at that time?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

Well, he admitted that he was

25

13

1

intoxicated and that he was on probation.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. McCUTCHEON:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. McCUTCHEON:

6
7

8
9

And even that he was driving?
Yes.

Well, that's clear.
Well, he was clearly driving the

car.
QUESTION:

So it was a clear violation of his proba­

tion, wasn't it?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

10

QUESTION:

1 1

MR. McCUTCHEON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

By his own admission?
Yes.

What do you need the hearing for at that

13

stage, in view of his subsequent admission at the revocation

14

hearing that he had violated the conditions of his parole?

15

Why aren't all the preceding steps utterly moot and irrelevant:

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

MR. McCUTCHEON:

Because, Your Honor, as this Court

has said, one of the purposes of that preliminary hearing is
not only to determine probable cause but to -QUESTION:

But he's determined it.

He's determined

it by his admission.
MR. McCUTCHEON:

But, number one, he was intoxicated

when he made that admission.
QUESTION:

What did he admit when he had the revoca­

tion hearing, which was a number of days or weeks later?
MR. McCUTCHEON: When I put him on the stand he admitted

25

that he had been drinking beer seven or eight hours earlier.
14

1

QUESTION:

2

•

3
4

And that he had admitted it before?

MR. McCUTCHEON:
QUESTION:

:

Yes.

And he was conscious of having admitted

it before?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

5

It seems to me, though, that what

6

this Court -- the problem with that approach is that you're

7

looking at a later determination of the merits to decide whethe

8

you . filed -- should or should not, have followed due. process

9

grounds earlier in the case. And you can never know that, and

10

a person can be incarcerated for a substantial length of time

1 1

without the disinterested determination that this Court set

12

forth as one of the minimum requirements of due process under

13

the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

14

But we decide specific concrete contro­

15

versies here, and in this case certainly there is some sense

16

that there wasn't a concrete controversy as to whether your

17

client at the initial stage had violated parole.
MR. McCUTCHEON:

18
19

There was no concrete conscious controversy at that time.
QUESTION:

20
21

22
23
24

I would agree with that statement.

Then, why haven't all of his rights been

fulfilled by the State of Texas?

Certainly there's no reason

to have a hearing about a fact which is not in dispute, is
there ?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

It seems to me that there is a

reason to have a hearing for a fact which may not be in dispute
25

15

1

and that is that in order to set a procedure, a constitutional

2

procedure under that statute, which-for seven years the Court

3

had said it did not have to follow, that even though he may

4

have admitted it at the time he is still entitled to that

5

hearing, to have the evidence presented against him, the wit­

6

nesses told to him, and a chance to speak.

7

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that in a civil case the

8

plaintiff alleges that the defendant was at the intersection

9

of High and Broad in Columbus, Ohio, at 12 noon on such-and-

10

such a day, and the defendant admits it, do you think that

1 1

either party is entitled to a hearing on that?

12

MR. McCUTCHEON:

Not in a civil case.

That's

13

governed by local procedures, whether that's an admission or

14

whether that's a concrete evidentiary fact,* or as to how it

15

can be used at trial.

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

QUESTION:

But isn't yours very much the same, that

there is no dispute as to the fact on which you want a hearing?
MR. McCUTCHEON:

There is no dispute now as to the

fact, there probably was not a dispute at the time, but the
fact is that he was not afforded those minimum due process
rights which I do not understand to be dependent on whether he
was guilty or innocent.

If he was guilty we don't need a

later revocation hearing on the fact of his guilt except for
determining whether he should be revoked or not.
QUESTION:

Well, that isn't what Morrissey v. Brewer

25
'

16

1

held at all.

2

should be held promptly- to determine, among other things,

3

whether they got the wrong person -- they might have two people

4

of the same name -- to give them a chance to have witnesses

5

that are in the same neighborhood if the place of the ultimate

revocation hearing is far distant.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS M. BECKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

And under the State of Texas law at

MR. BECKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Under Gerstein v.

Pugh, and the other cases, I don't believe that there is any
23

possibility of this Court giving any relief whatsoever to the
24

petitioner.
25

As a matter of fact, he's received a determination

2

that there was probable cause to arrest him on at least three

different occasions, varying in reliability.

later stated that he had been drinking eight hours earlier.

Actually, he testified at the evidentiary hearing -- it was

10

quite clear at the final revocation hearing that he had been

1 1

drinking for seven or eight hours, and he stated, I took my

12

first drink eight hours ago, and admitted that he had been

13

drinking wine, beer, and schnapps.
Now, at the scene of the arrest he didn't go into

as

to exactly what liquors he had been drinking

his car in irregular manner and in which he observed him in
what he believed to be an intoxicated state.
Not only did the arresting officer believe there was
probable cause but the arresting officer immediately called
the man's probation officer who met them at the jail.

At the

jail they had conversations with him after giving him Miranda
warnings for I believe 45 minutes, the record reflects, and
the probation officer testified at the revocation hearing,

25

20

1

no doubt that the man was drunk; he made no bones about'the

2

fact that he was drunk.

3

the reason he had come to the jail was because the police offi­

4

cer had called him to do so.

5

The probation officer testified that

All right, now, all this occurred on February 3.

that he could.
QUESTION:

This hearing that you referred to, the

QUESTION:

Do you suggest that that process is the

equivalent, the functional equivalent of the hearing that

might have been held before a neutral probation officer under

Morrissey v. Brewer?
MR. BECKER:

Not alone, Your Honor.

Not alone; no.

6

It's not the equivalent.

But in conjunction with the other

7

things that occurred in the case and in conjunction with the

8

revocation hearing, the final hearing itself, we do argue that

9

that was the functional equivalent of the preliminary hearing.
Now, if I -- when Gagnon and Morrissey v. Brewer

10
1 1

came down and the Texas courts started to read those cases ,

12

I need to explain the reaction that they had in their publisher

13

opinions to those cases, because the statement has been piade,

14

the Court of Criminal Appeals has consciously and steadfastly

15

ignored the decisions of this Court for eight years in this

16

area. And I don't believe it's true, and I don't believe that

25

it's fair.
When the cases came down the Court of Criminal Appeal

other people, for these people in Iowa and Wisconsin where
these cases are coming from.

Look what's happening to them;

they're being arrested without probable cause, they're being
arrested without warrant, they're being arrested by their
parole and probation officers.

They're not only not getting a

preliminary hearing, they're not even getting a final hearing.

In neither one of those cases did those men get a final

brief

Mr. Becker, you mention on page 11 of your

the case of Escoe v. Zerbst, which was decided by this

Court in 1935, which characterized probation as an act of

Do you suggest by that that as a matter of federal

constitutional law that Texas courts were at least entitled to

rely on that up until the time Morrissey v. Brewer came down,

in response to your suggestion that it's a flaw in our argu­

He has, not the limited right of confrontation

and cross-examination that this Court has spoken of in those
cases, but an unconditional right.
QUESTION:

Is it always a judge of the State of

Texas who hears the revocation proceeding?
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

Invariably.

Invariably a judge.

And that's considerably beyond our cases,
35

1

isn't it?

2

MR. BECKER:

QUESTION:

4

Always a judge, always an attorney.
You make Texas sound almost perfect.

It isn't, you knew..
MR. BECKER:

5

Well, no, Your Honor, Mr. Justice

6

Marshall may well have pointed out something that we might

7

have done better, but in truth, if you look at the Appendix

8

that's in our brief, which was prepared painstakingly, where

9

there is a comparison of Texas procedures with those of every

10

other state, as to what we selected as broad-based matters

1 1

of comparison, Fourth Amendment protection, Fifth Amendment

12

rights, right to counsel, and whether or not each of those

13

states affords those protections, Texas is the only state with

14

"yes's" all the way across except of course that a preliminary

15

hearing is not invariably required.
QUESTION:

to take him into custody and start the revocation proceeding,

MR. BECKER:

But at that point, Mr. Becker, in order

Yes.

The probation officer has to file

the motion.
QUESTION:

21

MR. BECKER:

22

QUESTION:

Where does he file it?
At court.
And who acts on it?

MR. BECKER:

issued.

Are you suggesting, or should you suggest,

that whatever reliability factor the initial hearing in

MR. BECKER:

It's -- yes, it's made up for, that it's

all-right-made-up-for, but because of the lack of a wrongful
determination down the line, because of that hearing

order to have a fairly reliable probable cause determination,

16

isn't it?

17

MR. BECKER:

Yes, that's right.

I don't -- I think

18

surely if Texas also required the presence of the accused at

19

a preliminary hearing and put all that on top of all this, we

20

24

25

might all applaud that.
QUESTION:

But you could arrest, you could have

people arrested and incarcerated on an ex parte proceeding
under an arrest warrant.
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:

It happens all the time.
And so, you're saying that this is as
38

'

1

reliable as that, anyway.

2

MR. BECKER:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes.
You file a motion and the judge acts on

it and issues a warrant.

5

MR. BECKER:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

It's as reliable as any --

Well, under Morrissey v. Brewer,, a man

7

in this situation, apparently driving while intoxicated,

8

might come into that preliminary hearing and bring in the

9

affidavit of his dentist that he'd just had two teeth pulled

10

and that he had given him a sedative and that that would ex­

11

plain

12

the probation officer might say, well, with that explanation,

13

after this don't drive your car after you've had a sedative,

14

and that would be the end of it.

15

a,

condition that would resemble intoxication. And then

Or, if he came in and said, I am not the man who

16

got arrested for driving while drunk, that was another man of

17

the same name, and the probation officer if satisfied would

18

then drop the matter.

19

20

21

22
23
24

25

MR. BECKER:

Is that not so?
This is true, Your Honor.

But, of

course, in this case the arresting officer and the probation
officer both spoke to him and of course he raised no -QUESTION:

So there were no problems of the kind

that we were concerned about in Morrissey v. Brewer?
MR. BECKER:

Right.

If anything like that had been

raised, well, these officers would have had the duty to tell
39

1

the magistrate about that when they told him about probable

2

cause.

3

that, they were aware of that and would still have been of

4

the opinion, Your Honor, there's probable cause to arrest this

5

man.

Or at least to tell

--

if-they didn't tell him about

In my opinion he was drunk.
QUESTION:

6

Now, your friend has not suggested --

7

at least if he did, I didn't hear him suggest anything that

8

might have been done, any showing that he might have made at

9

that Morrissey v. Brewer hearing.

Can you think of anything

10

that might have been accomplished by holding that hearing

1 1

right on the ground at the time?
MR. BECKER:

12

13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20

None whatsoever.

None whatsoever.

Under the Texas procedures, at the revocation of probation,
also, frequently the only issue -- and the only issue in this
case, after the guilt or innocence part of the hearing -was whether or not to continue his probation.

In Texas the

probationer has a right in the discretion of the trial judge
to be continued on probation even if he's found to be in vio­
lation of it.

sin fact, this was already done once in

Mr. Vincent's case.

And that is the real work of a lawyer in

the Texas procedures and one of the main reasons that he gets
21

a lawyer.

Not only can he be continued on probation, but his

22

term of imprisonment can be reduced by the judge at that point
23

to any term that he feels is just.

Again, he had assistance

24

of counsel there, and his counsel here today drove very hard
25

40

1

2

upon both of those points at that hearing.
The final matter I wanted-to mention, I suppose that

3

indeed the motion to dismiss the appeal, I was informed by

4

Mr. Rodak, had been denied rather than carried with the case.

5

So there will be no further, nothing further presented.

MR. McCUTCHEON:

One brief point, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. McCUTCHEON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT -- REBUTTAL
MR. McCUTCHEON:

I don't want this Court to leave

41

1

with the impression that in all probation revocation cases

2

the only way to get the probationer•into court is on an arrest

3

warrant with a predetermination by a j udicial,, magistrate for

probable cause.

5

Section 8(a) says, "At any time during the period of

probation the Court may issue a warrant for violation of any

7

of the conditions of the probation and cause the defendant to

be arrested.

MR. McCUTCHEON:

But that --

That's a considerably different kettle of

fish than having the decision to arrest made by an officer of
the law independently of the court.
MR. McCUTCHEON:

If it's done in the ordinary sense

that we think of an arrest warrant being done, that is, upon

Arrests are made on warrants that are

issued ex parte all the time.
MR. McCUTCHEON:

I understand, but they also may on

arrest warrants under Texas procedure.

They have to be made
