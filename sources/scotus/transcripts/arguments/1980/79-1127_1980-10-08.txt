ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. ANITA ASHTON

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MS. ASHTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

9

The State is here today to contend that the use of

10

psychiatric testimony in the punishment phase of a capital

11

murder trial is proper and is necessary to allow the jury to

12

have all relevant information concerning the character of a

13

defendant, especially when the jury is making this important

14

determination as to life or death.
This testimony is used only after a finding of guilt

15
16

in a capital murder trial.

17

incriminating the defendant or as to any issue of guilt for the

18

offense.

19

the time that he committed the crime and his mental status so

20

that the jury may take that factor into consideration in making

21

22
23
24
25

It is not used for the purpose of

It is merely as to determining his mental status at

the determination of future dangerousness, which is one of the
questions which the jury must answer under the Texas capital
punishment statute.
Testimony of this type has been used in the State of
Texas historically in murder prosecutions from the beginning of
3

1
this century pursuant to Section 1906 of the Texas Penal Code.

2
In a murder prosecution both the State and the defendant may
3

introduce all relevant evidence as to the defendant's mental
4

status so that the jury may have this evidence before them in
5

determining the appropriate punishment for a crime.
6
7

QUESTION:

the beginning of this century?

8
9

Has Texas had a bifurcated proceeding since

MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor, they have not but the

statute has been carried over from the beginning.

Under the

10

old "murder with malice" is when it was originated, when there

11

was one proceeding, not a bifurcated proceeding.

12

bifurcated proceedings --

3
4

QUESTION:

But when the

So until the present statute this kind of

evidence went in to this jury that determined guilt?

5

MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor.

There was a bifurcated

6

proceeding prior to this statute, beginning in 1965, the 1965

7

Code.

This particular statute of capital murder was enacted in

8

1973.

So during the period of time between 1965 and 1973 in

9

all murder with malice trials this evidence wasn't.
QUESTION:

20
21

22
23
24
25

But from the beginning of the century until

1965?
MS. ASHTON:

There was a single, a unitary trial, not

a bifurcated trial.
QUESTION:

Therefore this sort of evidence that you

said has traditionally been --

4

1

MS. ASHTON:
2

used as to guilt.

3

QUESTION:

4
5

As to guilt?

MS. ASHTON:

But it was admitted for the purposes of

punishment under the statutory provisions.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. ASHTON:

8

Evidence as to mental status could be

Were there any instructions?
Yes, Your Honor, there were generally

instructions.

9

QUESTION:

10

Limited to the determination of punishment?

MS. ASHTON:

Yes.

The mental status — depending on

11

the way the issue was introduced for the defense, if they'd in­

12

troduced it as
QUESTION:

13
14
15

No, no.

This is the prosecution introduc­

ing it.
MS. ASHTON:

If the prosecution introduced the evi­

16

dence, it would be limited as to punishment, not as to guilt.

17

The same statute provides for the use of introducing evidence

18

as to the deceased's character in prior altercations between

19

20

the deceased and the defendant, whether or not the defendant or
the deceased were acting in passion or were cruel or were agi­
tated at the same time.

It's that type of a statute.

21

QUESTION:

Is there any practice in Texas as distin­

22

guished from the rule in the Texas courts as to furnishing
23

notice of witnesses to the adverse party before the case opens?
24

MS. ASHTON:

If the counsel requests a list of

25
5

1

witness and it is so ordered by the court, it is provided, but
2

it is depending upon the type of order.

In this particular

3

case the witness list provided that the witnesses be listed
4

if known at that time.
5

6
7

8

The witness list was filed on the 11th,

trial began on the 25th, the only evidence in the record as to
what time, the first time that Dr. Grigson was contacted as a
witness was on the 21st, ten days after the witness list had
been filed.

9

In a trial in capital murder cases, generally the pro­

10

secution introduces evidence of prior crimes if known, if they

11

are available; sometimes they're not available.

12

tion now under some Texas decisions can under Texas law clearly

13

introduce evidence of extraneous offenses, of crimes.

stage.

testimony as to his ability to be rehabilitated.
There was a Texas case of Robinson v. State specifi­
cally on that point.

Both the State and prosecution have this

right to present this type of evidence as to the mental status
of the defendant.
6

1

QUESTION:
2

Ashton, go beyond that, however?

3
4
5

6
7

Does that psychiatric testimony, General

MS. ASHTON:

Your Honor, generally in the context

it's used, the State uses it if a psychiatrist or psychologist
has determined that the defendant has a sociopathic personality
or an antisocial personality and will continue to commit
crimes.

Now, in the particular case, in the manner in which

8

the testimony was presented, the psychiatrist testified that he

9

was a sociopathic personality.

One of the features of the

10

sociopathic personality was a lack of remorse -- that he found

11

a lack of remorse in this particular defendant, Ernest

12

Benjamin Smith.

13

where he asked him, what statements did the defendant make to

14

you to bring you to this conclusion that the defendant had an

15

antisocial personality?

16

to the psychiatrist by the defendant were brought into evidence

17

as a result of that questioning by defense counsel.
QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

24

And then statements that had been made

Then I take it that the State doesn't

agree with the observations in the amicus brief of the American
Psychiatric Association that this kind of testimony as to
predictive behavior is unreliable?
MS. ASHTON:

22
23

It was on cross-examination by Smith's counsel

that.

No, Your Honor, we do not agree with

We think that it is a factor that is brought to the

attention of the jury.

It is a type of evidence like any other

expert witness that is subject to cross-examination and subject
25

7

1

to impeachment and is one factor for the jury to consider.
2
3

QUESTION:

the APA to be taking an opposing position?

4
5

It seems a little strange, doesn't it, for

MS. ASHTON:

Your Honor, the brief that was filed by

the American Psychiatric Association reflects the viewpoint of

6

some psychiatrists with that association.

7

believes that it is not necessarily reflective of all psychia­

8

trists in America, no more so than a brief filed by the American

9

Bar Association would be reflective of all the attorneys in

The State of Texas

10

America.

11

of their profession as to predicting future dangerousness, or

12

future behavior.

13

area, future behavior is something that psychiatrists, and in

14

fact, all medical doctors are trained to predict from the very

15

beginning of their profession.

16

fever they are going to predict that they are going to be sick.

17

If they give them a certain type of medication, they are going

18

to predict that they are going to become well.

19
20
21

22
23

It is a brief submitting the viewpoint of a segment

But as is pointed out in many writings in the

QUESTION:

If they see someone that has a

Yes, but how can you predict future

behavior by way of recidivism?
MS. ASHTON:
of psychiatry.

Do you know?

Your Honor, I'm not trained in the area

If you are trained in that area, certainly

there are some personality types which apparently can be diag­
nosed, although —

24

QUESTION:

But at least Dr. Grigson thought he could?

25

8

1

MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor, not just Dr. Grigson.

2

Dr. Grigson is not the only psychiatrist that testifies like
3
4
5
6
7

this in Texas.

There are over 20 psychiatrists that I am famil­

iar with that have testified as to this type of future danger­
ous behavior for the State.

There are also psychiatrists that

testify as to the lack of future dangerous behavior on behalf
of defense counsel and testimony of this nature is presented

8

throughout the country in capital murder trials in the context

9

of negating the mitigating circumstance of rehabilitation,

10

oftentimes.

11
12
13

QUESTION:

Dr. Grigson is one of the favorites, isn't

he?
MS. ASHTON:

Well, Your Honor, he has had more exper­

14

ience in doing criminal examinations than probably any other

15

psychiatrist in the State of Texas.

And testifying.
And has testified numerous times.
Doesn't he testify in virtually every

capital case in Texas?
MS. ASHTON:
QUESTION:
MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor.
Well, most, doesn't he?
He testifies in most of the capital cases

in Dallas and in that surrounding northeastern part of Texas.
In Houston he rarely testifies nor -- he has testified on about
two occasions in San Antonio.

It depends upon the location of
9

the trial whether or not they use Dr. Grigson or another psy­

chiatrist .

MS. ASHTON:

10

There are some psychiatrists who consist­

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Not only in Dallas but --- throughout the State.
All over the country?
And the country.
Was not the genesis of this caution about

11

prediction based on -- if you know -- many situations where

12

psychiatrists testified that there was no future danger and

13

then very quickly it was found that that was erroneous and then

14

psychiatrists began to retreat from predictions; at least some

15

of them did?

16

MS. ASHTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Some of the articles

17

that I have read have indicated that particular thinking within

18

some members of the profession, especially when, after a period

19

of time where they did not predict future dangerousness,

20
21

22
23
24
25

a very violent crime resulted as a result of a person not being
incarcerated for future dangerous behavior.
QUESTION:

Ms. Ashton, you said that there were psy­

chiatrists who testified for the defense as to the absence of
the probability of recidivism or future danger.

Do they testi­

fy that it is simply beyond the ken of psychiatry, or that it
10

1

is within the ken of psychiatry but that with respect to this
2

particular defendant, he is not going to be a danger?
3

MS. ASHTON:

Generally they testify as to the latter.

4

They can predict future dangerousness and that this defendant
5

will not be dangerous in the future.
6
7
8
9
10

There are also some psy­

chiatrists and psychologist that testify that you simply cannot
predict future behavior.

That type of testimony is generally

used when they can't find a psychiatrist to come in and testify
that this particular defendant will not be dangerous in the
future, as rebuttal testimony.

11

QUESTION:

Ms. Ashton, does this case present any

12

issue with respect to the admissibility of this kind of testi­

13

mony?

14

MS. ASHTON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. ASHTON:

17

I believe, as to --

18

QUESTION:

Of the defendant's testimony, Your Honor?
No; the psychiatrist's testimony.
Yes, Your Honor, it does present an issue,

I thought it only was inadmissible .-- the

19

Court of Appeals was unhappy about the way the testimony was

20

obtained and the fact there was no notice given to counsel.
MS. ASHTON:

21

Your Honor, the

Court of Appeals opinion

22

went on in the second portion of the opinion, though, to state

23

that in the event of the retrial that the testimony could not

24

be used.

25

QUESTION:

Of Dr. Grigson because of the way it was
11

!

1
obtained.
2

MS. ASHTON:

Well, the way it was --

3

QUESTION:

But there's nothing in the opinion, is

4

there, that would foreclose the use of another psychiatrist
5

who would follow the procedures that they held were appropriate 1
6
7
8
9

Or is there?

Maybe I'm missing it.

MS. ASHTON:

Well, Your Honor, the interpretation

that I had of the second portion of the opinion said they were
indicating that anytime a psychiatrist was court-appointed and

10

went in to talk to a defendant and his testimony might con­

11

ceivably be used during the punishment stage of a trial, that

12

that psychiatrist must warn the defendant that he has a right

13

to remain silent, a right to --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Yes, but if he does give those warnings,

his testimony is admissible, isn't it?
MS. ASHTON:

Yes, Your Honor, but previous to that

17

time there's not been that standard of warning for a psychia­

18

trist to give to the defendant.

19

20
21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

I understand that, but the issue that you'v e

been talking about up to now is whether the testimony is ever
admissible.

And I think everybody assumes it's admissible if

you follow the procedures that they require.
QUESTION:

Well,, accept the American Psychiatric

Association.
QUESTION:

Well, but they don't define the questions
12

presented by the petition for certiorari.
MS. ASHTON:

No; their brief goes to the ultimate

issue of presenting this type of testimony.
QUESTION:

It didn’t seem to me that was among the

questions presented to us for decision; that's all.
QUESTION:

Is it true that in every case that

Dr. Grigson examined, he gave verbatim the same testimony -MS. ASHTON

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.
No, let me put that:

isn't that all the

testimony that we have on every case in this Court in which he
testified?

way.

Court -- presently?
Yes, that Dr. Grigson was there and where

he didn't say that "I believe he would go ahead and may commit
other similar or other criminal acts if given the opportunity
to do so."
MS. ASHTON:

Your Honor, the cases that have been in

this Court and are currently pending in this Court in which
13

1

Dr. Grigson has testified, the testimony is all as to a socio2
3

pathic personality.

QUESTION:

5

MS. ASHTON:

QUESTION:

8

MS. ASHTON:

10

11

Did he use the same words?
He uses approximately the same words for

his diagnosis --

7

9

It

has not been the only testimony --

4

6

He has testified in the same manner.

Same words; that's right.
-- if it's a similar diagnosis.

It is

not necessarily the only evidence that has been used in the pun­
ishment

stage

of all the trials, though.

The findings of Dr. Grigson have been used both to

12

help a defendant as well as to help the prosecution.

13

cases where Dr. Grigson has examined defendants and other psy­

14

chiatrists have examined defendants, and they have found that

15

there is not a sociopathic personality trait.

16

district attorney's office refuses to seek an indictment for a

17

capital offense because in Texas one of the very first steps

18

is a denial of bond in a capital offense.

19

20
21

22
23

In the

Generally the

In order to deny

bond the proof must be evidence, in the words of the Court of
Criminal Appeals, that not only will a conviction result
for capital murder but that affirmative answers will result to
all three special issues.
QUESTION:

This argument, I take it, goes to the

suggestion that Dr. Grigson isn't a "hanging psychiatrist"
24

necessarily.

Is that it?

25

14

1

MS. ASHTON:

That's correct.

2

QUESTION:

Now, are these statistics -- of record?

3

How do we know what you are saying?

It is part of this record?

4

MS. ASHTON:
5

6

record.

QUESTION:

Right; right.

But you might have had

testimony with respect to this in this case.

9
10

The cases in which the State does not seek an indict­

ment do not become a part of an official court record.

7

8

No, Your Honor, it is not part of this

MS. ASHTON:

Your Honor, we have not had evidentiary

hearings in any court on this.

11

QUESTION:

Well, that's what I was leading up to,

12

to asking you whether some of these claims were ever presented

13

to the state courts?

14

MS. ASHTON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor.
The Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims?
They were presented by purpose of a --

17

in this particular case, in a shotgun petition for writ of

18

habeas corpus which --

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. ASHTON:

21
22
23
24
25

Where -- in what -- where?
In the state courts, in the Texas Court

of Criminal Appeals and to the trial court approximately I be­
lieve it was four or five days before an execution was sched­
uled to take place for this defendant.

The relief was denied

summarily in both the trial court and the Court of Criminal
Appeals.
15

1

1
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, would these claims have been open

in the state courts on a state collateral proceeding?

I know

the state collateral relief was denied just summarily, without

4

an opinion.
5

6

claims were properly presented, could have been properly pre­
sented in a state collateral proceeding?

7

8

Do you know whether the Fifth and Sixth Amendment

MS. ASHTON:

Your Honor, they have been presented by

indirect appeal in some other cases.

9

QUESTION:

10

I'm asking about this case.

MS. ASHTON:

Well, the court has found, the Texas

11

Court of Criminal Appeals has found that there is no Fifth and

12

Sixth Amendment right as to psychiatric testimony.

13

QUESTION:

I know, but I'm asking whether these

14

claims were properly presented in the state collateral pro­

15

ceeding.

16

19
20

Were those claims open in the state collateral pro­

They denied them.
So state remedies have been exhausted?
Technically the state remedies have been

The State is of the opinion in this particular case

that the District Court opinion went further than the pleadings
16

1

that were filed in the case as to setting forth the issues in­
2

volved.

Therefore the state courts were not given an oppor­

3

tunity to fully analyze and have an opportunity to hear the
4

issues as were decided by the federal District Court.
5

QUESTION:
6

then, that state remedies haven't been exhausted?

7

Well, then your claim, is it, must be,

Your Honor, because of the decision

that there is not a Fifth and Sixth Amendment right to psychia­

QUESTION:

Well, as the case comes here, I had under­

stood that the two issues were whether it was a violation of due
process to fail to give notice of Dr. Grigson's testimony, that
he would testify; and second, that the Constitution required
that before any interview material could be used, that the
17

1

defendant had to be informed that the information might be used

against him.

I thought those were the only two issues presentee

here .

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL BERGER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

As the Chief Justice just pointed out, we have before

the Court today basically two sets of issues, either one of

whch standing alone is sufficient to invalidate the death sen­
tence imposed upon Mr. Smith.

5

QUESTION:

Well, is there a death sentence outstand­

ing now?

6

MR. BERGER:

I believe there technically is because

7

the 5th Circuit decision has been stayed and Mr. Smith is pre­

8

sently on death row in Texas.

9

Now these two issues can be loosely described as --

QUESTION:

Who stayed the decision?

I wasn't aware

of that.

12

MR. BERGER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BERGER:

The 5th Circuit.
Oh, it stayed its own -I might add, we did not oppose that.

15

The choice for Mr. Smith was either the Dallas County Jail

16

or Ellis Unit at Huntsville, and given

17

that would pass we felt that he would still be better off down

18

there at Huntsville.

the amounts of time

One issue is the surprise witness issue, which is
grounded in both Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments dealing with
the manner in which the State presented Dr. Grigson's testimony
at the penalty phase.
The other issue

with both Fifth and Sixth Amendment

components deals with the manner in which the State obtained
24

the very basis for this testimony in the first place.

The Court of Appeals didn't proceed on the

MR. BERGER:

Yes, they expressly affirmed the District

Court's finding of facts that the prosecutors had intentionally

10

failed to place Dr. Grigson's name on the witness list in a

11

deliberate effort to surprise defense counsel.

MR. BERGER:

15

Would it make any difference constitution­

I think it would make the State's case

a little easier --

QUESTION:

17

MR. BERGER:

On the due process.
Yes.

Although the Court of Appeals did

18

point out that even if it was inadvertent, the prejudice in

19

this case was so substantial that the result might very well be

20
21

22
23

the same.
QUESTION:

This case I'm talking about.

In this case

it would have made no difference whether it was inadvertent or
calculated.
MR. BERGER:

I do think that it makes the case

24

stronger because there is no doubt from the record, no doubt at

all, that the prosecutors knew several days in advance that

they were going to call Dr. Grigson and in fact deliberately

If you'll look at pages 15 and

16 of the Appendix, the voir dire examination of Dr. Grigson
prior to his actual testimony, this examination took place on
Tuesday, March 26, 1974, just before he actually testified.
And he says there, page 15, that he had been asked to testify

8

in this case the previous Thursday, Thursday, March 21, 1974,

9

five days earlier.

10

He specifically had been told that he would be called,

11

that he would be needed the following week.

Dr. Grigson, in fact, discussed his

findings at a much earlier date with the prosecutor, gave the
prosecutor a copy of his report, and was, I think it is fair from
page-16, asked sometime prior to March 21 to testify.
As Ms. Ashton pointed out, Dr. Grigson does most of

23

his work in the courts in Dallas.

He regularly transacts busi­

24

ness with the Dallas District Attorney's Office.
25

21

They knew

about his involvement in this case way before the 21st and it
is clear that at the very minimum, no later than March 21,
they knew he would testify.

MR. BERGER:

QUESTION:

You were not trial counsel, were you?
Excuse me?
You were not trial counsel, were you?
No, I was not.
Do you know whether defense counsel --

apparently this Grigson has testified in so many cases around

10

Dallas, in capital cases, would he not have anticipated that

11

Grigson probably was going to be called?
MR. BERGER:

earliest cases under the new Texas statute, one of the very

QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

I see.
I don't know that for sure.

As the Court

knows, it was the only case that had been affirmed by the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals other than Jurek at the time that
Jurek was decided.
QUESTION:

It was Smith.

20

MR. BERGER:

That's correct.

21

QUESTION:

And in Smith, according to the Jurek

22

opinion or an opinion in Jurek, there was offered in evidence
23

the conclusion of a psychiatrist that Smith had a sociopathic
24

personality and that his patterns of conduct would be the same

in the future as they had been in the past.

It's relevant

here, though, particularly on the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
claim, because it points out a problem that we have in Texas
with psychiatrists who regularly work with the prosecution,
going in to see defendant at the jail after he has been indicted
and after counsel has been appointed.

We're concerned with

that practice as done by psychiatrists who are antecedently

favorable to the State.

QUESTION:

That's where it comes in.

Of course

Well, what if Dr. Grigson were asked to

examine 100, or say 50 defendants, and he examined them and 50
of them, or 25 of them, he said, nothing wrong with these
people, and the others, he said they were sociopaths.

And the

6

prosecution asked for the death penalty for 25, and not for 25

7

others.

8

would you call him prosecution-oriented?

9

And then they called Grigson and the 25, they --

MR. BERGER:

In view of the use to which -- I would

10

say that his approach might be more balanced if that were the

11

case, which it is not.

QUESTION: Well, how do you know it isn't?

12
13

But I would still be -How do you

know it isn't?
MR. BERGER:

14

I would still -- we can look at the

15

cases in which he has testified that are reported, cases that

16

have been through the courts.

QUESTION:

18
19

20

That still doesn't show that Mr. Justice

White's hypothetical isn't correct, as the cases in which he's
testified are, would be the 25 hypothetical cases in which he
found that the defendant was a sociopath.
MR. BERGER:

ample opportunity in this case to give us some information on

the presentation of Dr. Grigson's testimony." The State has never
claimed that he was a rebuttal witness; never.
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

What did the Texas court say?
the Texas court, looking at the record,

decided for themselves that he had been a rebuttal witness and
28

I think the State's comment there in the 5th Circuit two years

On March 25, a Monday, the opening day of the trial,
the day before Dr. Grigson's testimony, defense counsel made a
motion in limine asking the trial court to bar the testimony
of any individual not on that list.

25, 1973, and only 18 days earlier the State had announced that
it intended to seek the death penalty.
Dr. Grigson went to the jail and he simply proceeded
to speak with Mr. Smith for about 90 minutes.

He said that

Mr. Smith cooperated fully, he was pleasant, he was courteous,
he was extremely polite.

And during those 90 minutes this man

against him at the penalty phase.

No one ever told Mr. Smith

that his encounter with Dr. Grigson could have any adversarial

purpose whatsoever.

Certainly no one told him that his com­

Long after it had actually occurred.

It

14

was sometime during the jury selection process which began, I

15

believe, March 11 and ran through March 25.

16

about the State's position, as I read it, is that they are saying

17

that all of these capital defendants who have been examined by

18

Dr. Grigson and others -- and altogether there are 30 cases

19

that I'm aware of; Dr. Grigson has testified in 20; altogether

20
21

22
23
24
25

A curious thing

the Court of Criminal Appeals has affirmed 62, to date, so we
have psychiatric testimony in about half of them, Dr. Grigson
in about one-third of them.
The State is of the view that all of these defendants,
these capital defendants, have absolutely no Fifth Amendment
privilege when faced with a psychiatrist under these
35

1
2
3
4
5
6

circumstances.

Taken literally, this means that in their view

a capital defendant could be compelled to provide the very evi­
dence through which the State will seek his execution.
QUESTION: Well, he could be called to testify by the
State at the penalty trial.
MR. BERGER:

That would logically follow also; yes.

7

They're saying he has no Fifth Amendment privilege, that upon

8

conviction -- I must point out that this interview took place

9

before conviction.

But leaving that aside for a moment, we can

10

treat that in a lengthy footnote in our brief.

11

that the State can reuire a capital defendant to submit to

12

examination by a psychiatrist knowing full well that that

13

psychiatrist will then recommend whether or not he's fit to live

14

QUESTION:

15

Amendment claim?

16

the Sixth Amendment.

17
18
19

20

They're saying

Well, what's their answer to the Sixth

Even if that were so, it wouldn't dispose of

MR. BERGER:

Yes, I don't think they have really

addressed that very much in their brief at all if -- we have a
highly critical stage of the proceeding here; I can't think of
a more critical moment in the history of this case.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Berger, what if the trial judge

21

at the time of the arraignment orders a competency hearing for
22
the accused and the accused simply says, I decline to speak
23

with any psychiatrist, does that prevent any further proceedings
24

in the case?
25

36

MR. BERGER:

I think that what would probably happen

in a situation like that, defense counsel felt there was a real
need, a strong need for a competency exam to be conducted.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the defense counsel said, no,

I'm not going to let my client speak with any psychiatrist?
MR. BERGER:

I think that would be the end of it.

7

I think that if there is a real need for a competency exam

8

defense counsel would do well to urge the court to bar the

9

testimony of the psychiatrist who does the competency exam,

10

11

bar that psychiatrist from testifying at -QUESTION:

Your position, then, ultimately, leaves the

12

fact that someone charged with capital murder can effectively

13

frustrate that charge by simply refusing to submit to a compe­

14

tency hearing before there is ever a trial on the guilt or

15

innocence —

16

MR. BERGER:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

Oh, no.

If he refuses, when it's the end of it,

you'd just say, they'dMR. BERGER:

No, I'm not saying that.

just

try

him.

Oh, no, I don't mean it's the -- I just

meant it was the end of the question of -- oh, I'm sorry, I
misunderstood your question.
QUESTION:

You would just try him.

22

MR. BERGER:

Oh, no, of course I'm not saying they

23

can't try him.

What they can do, the obvious solution, is to

24

simply say that the doctor who performs the competency
25

37

1

examination, if there is a very strong need for a competency
2

exam, that doctor cannot then testify --

3
4
5

QUESTION:

say a word, to even talk to them?

The State is free to try him

then, I take it.

6
7

Yes, but what if the defendant refuses to

MR. BERGER:

I believe that they are, yes, and unless

there is some overwhelming evidence of which one does need a

8

psychiatrist's testimony that might show that he's incompetent

9

anyhow if he's doing all kinds of strange things, I suppose.

10

QUESTION: Does that refusal to submit to an examinatior

11

and answer questions constitute a waiver of any future claim

12

of lack of competency, in your view?
MR. BERGER:

13

I don't know whether that would be the

14

case.

15

speak to the doctor, but in any event I do know that he cer­

16

tainly by requesting -- if you -- let's look at it the other

17

way around.

18

is his right under the Due Process Clause, I can certainly --

19

that would not mean that he waives his Fifth Amendment privi­

20
21

22
23
24
25

I think it would depend on his reasons for failing to

If he were to request a competency exam, which

lege with respect to the penalty phase.

And that's a very

important point because it comes up in some other Texas cases.
Here there was no request.

To get back to the facts

of this case, here there was no request for a competency exam,
there was no request for a sanity exam.

Defense counsel had

never at any time raised the question of alleged incompetence
38

i

1

or insanity of this defendant.

2
3

QUESTION:

judge on his own motion has to order an exam, haven't they?

4
5

But some of our cases have held the trial

MR. BERGER:

Yes, and if it's only going to be used

for competency, then the law is clear that it is a purely

6

benign, neutral, nonadversarial proceeding.

7

where that examination is then turned around and used to get

8

the defendant executed.

9

here.

10

The problem is

That's the problem we're concerned witl

Now, I must point out that under Texas law the State

11

has the burden at the penalty phase.

12

of proving certain statutorily specified facts as a precondi­

13

tion to imposition of the death sentence and of particular

14

relevance to this case, the State has to prove on its own beyonc

15

a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of a unanimous jury

16

that there is a probability that this defendant would engage

17

in future criminal acts of violence that would be a danger to

18
19

20

society.

The State has the burden

That was their burden, and the State is saying that

they can require the defendant to help the State meet that
burden out of his own mouth? Surely the Fifth Amendment protects
against that.

21

QUESTION:

Do you think it would violate his consti­

22
23

tutional rights if the psychiatrist simply went to the institu­
tion where he was incarcerated and then observed him for two or

24

three days, even without having any responses coming from
25

39

'

1

the defendant?

2
3
4
5

MR. BERGER:

That's a much more difficult question.

The Court of Appeals addressed that in its opinion and said
they really weren't sure.

You know, perhaps it would depend

on the facts of the case.

But we know that here, in fact, he

6

examined Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith made statements, the statements

7

were used.

8
9

Incidentally, I should point out, although our case
is not based purely on the use of the statements themselves or

10

rather the inferences the doctor jdrev from them that it is not

11

true that on every occasion that Dr. Grigson testified to spe­

12

cific statements that the door was opened by defense counsel.

13

You'll find at least one inference on page 33 of the Appendix,

14

towards the end of the examination, where Dr. Grigson on his

15

own volunteered some statements that Mr. Smith had allegedly

16

made .

17
18
19
20
21

22
23

But, apart from that, the doctor drew all of his
diagnosis from Smith's comments, from what Smith said to him,
and apparently from what Smith supposedly did not say to him.
That certainly does present a very serious Fifth Amendment
problem and also, as Mr. Justice White pointed out, because of
the time in which it occurred, raises questions under a host of
Sixth Amendment cases, Massiah, Brewer v. Williams, j:ust last
term United States v. Henry, the need for the assistance of

24

counsel in this circumstance.

After all, I'll admit that without

25

40

1

the Sixth Amendment aspects of this decision, the defendant
2

might be somewhat confused by the warnings he was given.
3
4
5

QUESTION:

there couldn't be a waiver of counsel at this stage without
the help of counsel?

6
7

But didn't the Court of Appeals hold that

MR. BERGER:

I do not read their opinion as going

that far and of course this Court's opinion in Brewer v.

8

Williams does not go that far.

9

of Appeals --

10
11

QUESTION:
going that far?

You're not claiming that and you're not

Is that right or not?

MR. BERGER:

12

You'll notice that the Court

I'm not going that far because this

13

Court as I read Brewer v. Williams has not gone that far, and

14

that's one reason why there's a need for warnings.
QUESTION:

15
16

here?

17

MR. BERGER:

18

QUESTION:

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

But at least you say there was no waiver

There isn't.
Was there ever an opportunity to waive

counsel?
MR. BERGER:

Oh, obviously, obviously not.

I think

also that certainly there would be the heaviest of all con­
ceivable burdens upon the State to show a genuine waiver.

I'm

just saying that under Brewer as I read it at this moment this
Court has left that matter open.
You'll notice, incidentally, that the Court of Appeals
41

1

used the very word from the Constitution, "assistance" of
2
3
4
5
6
7

counsel; did not go any farther than that.

So I do not believe

that in using the word "assistance" that they meant to impose
some new rule that can't be waived without notice to counsel,
a rule not yet adopted by this Court.
I might only conclude by pointing out that 25 years
ago Dean Griswold wrote in "The Fifth Amendment Today,"

8

"We do not require people to sign their own death warrants or

9

to dig their own graves."

And I think he said that at the

10

height of the McCarthy period in 1954 for a very special reason.

11

He wanted to emphasize the importance of the Fifth Amendment,

12

and that, he felt, was the perfect illustration, and so it is.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. ANITA ASHTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MS. ASHTON:

First of all, in regard to the surprise

issues and a continuance, under Texas law historically and it
is well established that a counsel if he is in fact surprised
must move for a continuance from the trial judge.

Contrary to

Mr. Berger's statements, the trial judge -- there is no

another.

He may have, Your Honor, but there is

no indication that that was the reason that he did so.

18

20

May he not have done so here because he

thought defense counsel was surprised?

16
17

There is nothing in the record --

surprise?
MS. ASHTON:

Your Honor, there are facts in the

record -- first of all, the subpoena that was issued indicates
24

that he knew Dr. Grigson had examined his client and obviously
25

43

1

2

gave some consideration to the fact or he would not have re­
quested the subpoena for the visitation records.

3
4
5

Secondly, this counsel, this was not the first capi­
tal case tried in Dallas nor was it the first capital case in
which this counsel had defended.

He had defended William David

6

Hovila a month before in Dallas County and Dr. Grigson had tes­

7

tified during Hovila's trial as to sociopathic personality fea­

8

tures, although there had been an issue of sanity raised in that

9

trial.

Still, Dr. Grigson had given testimony extremely similar

10

to the testimony given in the Smith case and was cross-examined

11

by this same trial counsel one month previously.

12

Further, he said the defendant himself knew he had

13

been examined by Dr. Grigson,

14

the psychiatrist had talked to him, but there is no showing in

15

the record that the defendant had given that information to

16

counsel; I'm making an assumption from the record.

17
18
19
20

23

and surely told his counsel that

These are some of the reasons the State feels that a
full evidentiary hearing should have been conducted as to the
issue of due process and surprise in order to have all of the
facts in the record, to give the State an opportunity to crossexamine the defense attorney as to his statements in his affi­
davit, for many statements could not be disproven any other way
than on cross-examination from him from the witness stand.
An affidavit was submitted by the trial court.

The trial court

24

stated that to the best of his knowledge he had informed defense
25

44

1

counsel, there had been no written notification -- at that time

The

report from Dr. Grigson had been placed in the court's file,
was available to either side for review.

to Dr. Grigson; there was nothing to prohibit the defense coun­

sel from talking to Dr. Grigson; he was appointed as a disin­

7

terested expert by the court.

8

him and talked to him if they had gone through the court file

9

or had given preparation in that regard.

10

QUESTION:

The defense could have gone to

When you say that the report was placed

11

in the court file, is it common practice in Texas for attorneys

12

to run through the file rather than rely on a witness list or

13

documents served on them?

14

MS. ASHTON:

Yes, Your Honor, it is common practice

15

for attorneys to look at a court's file fairly frequently,

16

especially when they're trying a capital-type case, that the

17

court's file is something that is open to either side and is

18

going to have information in it as to subpoenas, as to other

19

materials, communications with the court.

20
21

22
23
24

It's a fairly common

practice in trial practice to look through the court's file on
a relatively frequent basis, especially in preparing for a case
of this nature.
QUESTION:

Ms. Ashton, if a state passed a statute

that said in a capital case in the second part of a bifurcated
trial as to whether or not the man gets death is determined by

25
45

a psychiatrist.

Would that be allowed by due process?

have to be determined by a psychiatrist?

MS. ASHTON:

Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that

under the context of having an expert witness make an ultimate
factual determination without giving the jury consideration as

to all the facts of the trial, I believe that probably would be

a denial of due process.

16

But that is not the statute, it is
The State does not have to present

The State can rely only on the testimony that

In calling Dr. Grigson to the stand as a psychiatrist

17

he was called as a rebuttal witness in the order that the wit­

18

nesses were presented, though we contend that he was not avail­

19

able to testify initially.

20
21

22
23
24
25

The State was under no obligation

to call him as a rebuttal witness.

It could have relied strict­

ly on the evidence that had been introduced in the guilt phase
of the trial where the defendant had testified, where his oral
confession had come in and where there had been testimony
from the police officer who had witnessed the oral confession
that the defendant showed no remorse upon questioning by defense
46

1

counsel of whether or not the defendant seemed emotional or
2

seemed to regret the crime.
3

Additionally, the defendant in this case could have
4

taken the stand in the punishment stage of the trial and testi­
5

8

10

11
12

fied that he was sorry about the murder, that he regretted the
fact that William Moon was no longer alive, that if he could
have he would have stopped it.

But he did not take it.

His

counsel did ask him about regrets during the guilt phase -QUESTION:

At this point, Ms. Ashton, could the State

have called Smith, at the penalty phase of the trial?
MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor, I don't think they

probably could have called Smith to force him to testify; no.

13

QUESTION:

Well, then you're abandoning part of your -

14

QUESTION:

In the face of that answer, how does that

15

square with your argument that Fifth Amendment does not apply

16

at the penalty phase?

17

MS. ASHTON:

*

Your Honor, although you could not force

18

a person to give testimony from his mouth, the Fifth Amendment

19

should not apply to prohibit use of testimony which has, serves

20

as a basis for an opinion which has been rendered; that the

21

22
23
24
25

Fifth Amendment should not go as to those statements made by
the defendant after he's been found guilty as to statements of
guilt, especially in circumstances where he has given the same
testimony in the court as to the facts of the offense.
QUESTION:

If while incarcerated he had boasted to the
47

1

jailor about the crime and said if he had the opportunity he
2
3
4
5

would do it over again, would that be admissible under Texas
law in the second phase of the proceeding?
MS. ASHTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So that you're putting the statements to

6

Dr. Grigson in the same category as voluntary statements made tc

7

a third person?

8

MS. ASHTON:

Not necessarily

because they are volun­

tary, but they are made to a court-appointed expert, but he is

was not to gather incriminating evidence for the purpose of

12

conviction.

His purpose

His purpose was to evaluate mental status.

He

3

as a result of the examination gained some knowledge of the

4

crime, but his knowledge of the crime was not used for the pur­

5

pose of conviction.

6

QUESTION:

May I ask another question about the

7

penalty phase of the trial in the Texas procedure?

8

I think I understood you to say that the State need not present

9
20
21

22
23

any evidence at this.

Suppose --

It could rely on what came in in the

guilt phase.
MS. ASHTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Suppose the State did not present any evi­

dence and then the defense, as I think in this case, presented
no evidence, could the State then call Dr. Grigson?

24

MS. ASHTON:

No, Your Honor.

25
48

The State rested, and

i

1

the defense rested without presenting any evidence whatsoever.
2
The State could not -- they already -- they'd had their one
3

chance to present evidence.

If the defense chose not to present

4

any, they could not present any further evidence.

QUESTION:

7

8

11

So there are some rules that apply in the

penalty phase of the trial -MS. ASHTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- even though you say the Fifth Amendment

is not a -MS. ASHTON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
I just wanted to follow up on the same

12

thought that Justice Blackmun was raising.

13

acknowledged, as I understand you, that the State could not

14

have compelled the defendant to testify at the penalty phase?

15

MS. ASHTON:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

You have now

That's correct, Your Honor.
Could the State have used Dr. Grigson's

testimony during the guilt phase?
MS. ASHTON:

The state could not have used Dr. Grigson 's

19

testimony because under the statute, under 4602, which provides

20

for psychiatric, court-appointed psychiatric examinations in a

21

criminal trial, it specifically states that no evidence may be

22

used as to the issue of guilt.
