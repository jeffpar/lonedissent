ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on the Government's petition for

1 1

certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit.

12

Circuit set aside a regulation of the Federal Reserve Board

13

which authorizes bank holding companies and their non-bank

14

subsidiaries to organize and manage closed-end investment

15

companies within a framework of restrictions and safeguards

16

prescribed by the Board.

17

The D.C.

The question presented in this case is whether the

18

Board's regulation infringes either the Glass-Steagall Act or

19

the Bank Holding Company Act.

20

stands in the way of the Board's regulation, and that the

21

regulation is a lawful exercise of the authority vested in the

22

Board by Congress.

We contend that neither statute

After summarizing the essential provisions of the
regulation, I'd like to explain why it's consistent with both
of these statutes.

1

In a nutshell, the Board's regulation permits bank

2

holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to organize

3

or sponsor a closed-end investment company and then to manage

4

the company and its investment portfolio.

5

hearing the Board determined that this activity is closely

6

related to banking and is a proper incident.

7

that the authorized activity would not infringe the Glass-

8

Steagall Act, the Board prescribed a code of restrictions,

restrictions which it pointed out were even more stringent

Act.

The Court identified nothing in the text of the
Bank Holding Company Act which led to that conclusion, but

10

instead relied on what it called the policies of the Glass-

1 1

Steagall Act which, it said, carried forward and informed the

12

meaning of the

later

enacted. Bank Holding Company Act.

The objection to this ruling is that there is nothing

13
14

in the text of either the Glass-Steagall Act or the Bank

15

Holding Company Act which supports the Court of Appeals policy

16

analysis.

17

no further than the plain meaning of the statutes themselves

18

in order to affirm the action of the administrative agency.

19

Examination of the literal terms of the Glass-Steagall Act

20

shows that there is no provision which forbids what the Board

21

22
23
24

25

Indeed, this is a case in which the Court need look

has permitted.
Congress prescribed several provisions in the
Glass-Steagall Act, which apply to different entities in the
bank holding company system.

Separate rules are prescribed

for banks and for bank affiliates Such as bank holding
'5

1

companies.

2

pally in the issuance, underwriting, or distribution of

3

securities.

4

Bank affiliates are forbidden to engage princi­

Neither a closed-end investment company nor a bank

5

holding company which manages the investment company would

6

run afoul of that statutory provision.

7

ment company does not engage principally in the issuance or

8

distribution of securities because by definition a closed end

9

investment company is a company which issues its shares only

A closed-end invest­

10

when it's organized and on infrequent occasions thereafter.

11

In this respect it's identical with any other business corpora­

12

tion, including banks and bank holding companies themselves,

13

which issue their securities when they're organized.

14

It's quite the opposite of an open end investment

15

company which continuously engages in securities issuance or

16

an investment banking firm which is continuously engaged in

17

offering and distributing securities to the investing public.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

If Congress had meant to prohibit affiliations be­
tween banks and all companies that offer securities when
they're organized, it surely would not have written the
statute the way it did.

It would have forbidden all corporate

affiliates that issue securities, not just affiliates that
issue securities principally, or engage principally in the
issuance.of securities.
Nor is it possible, we submit, for a bank holding
6

1

company that manages a closed-end investment company to become

2

principally engaged in the issuance and distribution of securi­

3

ties in violation of Section 20.

4

not issue any securities at all under this regulation, and

5

is completely insulated from the process by which the securi­

6

ties of the investment company are distributed and underwritten

to the public.

Respondent's contrary views under the Glass-Steagall

this case in almost every relevant respect.

issue and underwrite the securities of an investment fund,

15

which the Court said was the equivalent of an open-end fund or

16

a mutual fund.

Camp dealt with

The Court held in Camp that a bank could not

In this case the Board has forbidden banks, bank

18

holding companies, and their non-bank subsidiaries to engage

19

in underwriting or promotional activities of any kind.

And

20

in addition the Board was at pains to prescribe safeguards

21

to prevent the kinds of abuses and unsound banking practices

22

which this Court discussed in Camp.

23
24

25

Most importantly, bank assets are not permitted to be
placed at risk under this regulation.

No entity in the

holding company system can buy securities from the investment

2

no more risk of financial loss and no more risk of unsound

3

banking practices than when a bank sets up and manages a

common trust fund or a pooled employee benefit fund within

5

its own trust department.

In short, there is

Respondent devotes considerable argument in its

6
7

brief to the idea that a bank holding company for a non-bank

8

subsidiary operating under this regulation might violate

9

Section 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act.
There are two separate answers to this assertion.

10
1 1

In the first place, Section 21 applies only to deposit-receiv­

12

ing entities as both the Court of Appeals and the Federal

13

Reserve Board agreed.

14

activities of bank holding companies and their non-bank subsid­

15

iaries which do not engage in the business of receiving depo­

16

sits.

17

to a bank holding company, it would not be violated by the

18

21

22
23
24

25

And in the second place, even if Section 21 did apply

activities which the Board has permitted here.
Section 21 forbids engaging in the business of issu­

19

20

It therefore has no bearing on the

ing or underwriting securities.

Bank holding companies are not

the issuers of any securities under this regulation and they're
completely cut off from the process by which the securities of
the investment company are underwritten and distributed to the
public.

In sum, we say there is nothing in the text of the

Glass-Steagall Act that forbids the activities which the Board
8

1

has permitted.

2

policies from the Act which differ from its plain meaning.

3

Congress was well aware of the potential dangers

Nor is it appropriate, we submit, to infer

4

that can result from particular involvement in given securities

5

activities by banking organizations.

6

tial, it prohibited certain activities and it left certain

7

other activities untouched.

8

Reserve Board testified before Congress in 1933, and I quote,

9

"It's impossible to classify absolutely all affiliates that

In light of that poten­

As Governor Myer of the Federal

10

engage in securities transactions as wicked and vicious."

11

Senator Glass replied, "We're not classifying all of them, and

12

we're not intending to reach all of them."

13

This is a significant colloquy, we submit, between

14

the Senate draftsman for the Glass-Steagall Act, the principal

15

draftsman, and the Governor of the Federal Reserve Board,

16

who proposed the language which Congress later adopted in

17

Section 20.

18

there is no warrant for extending the carefully formulated

19

prohibitions which Congress has actually enacted.

20
21

22
23
24

25

In light of this measured statutory objective,

Respondent's assertions find no more support under
the Bank Holding Company Act than they do under Glass-Steagall.
The Board adopted this regulation under Section 4(c)(8) of
the Bank Holding Company Act.

That's a provision which

empowers the Board to designate certain nonbanking activities
as closely related to banking and as proper incidents.

Section 4(c)(8) itself neither permits nor prohibits

any particular activities.

Congress's

approval

of

these activities

for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(7) is a rather
clear indication that it did not mean to foreclose the more
limited activities at issue in this case under the flexible
standard of Section 4(c)(8).

The legislative history of the

Bank Holding Company Act is completely barren of any indica­
tion that Congress meant to forbid sponsorship and management
of a closed-end investment company.
In fact, the Senate report that accompanied the 1970
10

1

amendments states explicitly that Section 4(c)(8) was not

2

intended to prejudice the right of bank holding companies to

3

operate investment companies to the extent permitted under

4

existing law.

5

that produced the current version of Section 4(c)(8) empha­

6

sized, this statute was not intended to enlarge or to contract

7

the prohibitions contained in the Glass-Steagall Act.

8
9

And as the Chairman of the Conference Committee

In short, Section 4(c)(8) contains no prohibition of
the activities that are in question here.

And since the

10

Glass-Steagall Act does not forbid those activities either,

1 1

the Glass-Steagall Act can hardly be relied on as a basis for

12

narrowly interpreting Section 4(c)(8) to foreclose those same

13

activities.

14

Respondent's central argument under the Bank Holding

15

Company Act is that bank holding companies should not be per­

16

mitted to engage in this activity because this activity would

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

be improper if undertaken by a bank.

With deference to coun­

sel, I am compelled to say that this argument is both irrele­
vant and it's erroneous.
We say it's irrelevant because both the Bank Holding
Company Act and the Glass-Steagall Act recognize that bank
holding companies may engage in a significantly broader range
of securities-related activities than may banks .
We say the argument is erroneous; because even banks
may engage in this activity if they adhere faithfully to the

11

1

restrictions and the safeguards prescribed by the Board.

2

Those restrictions assure that the investment advisor neither

3

underwrites securities nor invests any assets in the investment

4

company or purchases any of the securities.

5

there is no way that a bank operating within the Board's

6

restrictions would infringe the Glass-Steagall Act prohibitions

7

and standards which apply to banks.

For this reason

8

I should also make brief reference to the policy

9

arguments that Respondent asserts at.the end of its brief.

10

Those contentions, we submit, are properly addressed to

1 1

Congress and not to the judiciary.

12

relied on considerations of general statutory purpose and

13

policy as additional reasons for enforcing the literal terms

14

of the statute.

But in this case Respondent is raising policy

bitions of the statute.
As this Court's recent decisions make clear, this is
an inappropriate judicial function.

Statutes can't be revised

in light of policy arguments, and it's especially inappropriate
here where Respondent asks the Court, in effect, to formulate
new prohibitions to protect it against competition, competi­
tion which the Antitrust Division pointed out before the Board
would be highly beneficial to the investing public.
As was shown in our briefs, the potential hazards
that Respondent discusses are amply protected against under

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. DUANE VIETH

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. VIETH:

12
13
14

Mr. Vieth.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The regulation of the Board of Governors, which is

15

in issue here, as well as the interpretive ruling of the Board

16

which accompanied that order, were issued under Section

17

4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company act.

18

prohibits bank holding companies from engaging in any non­

19

banking activities or acquiring subsidiaries so engaged.

20

That Act, in general,

However, Section 4(c)(8) does authorize the Board to

21

permit certain non-banking activities by holding companies

22

and their affiliates, provided that those activities are --

23

and I quote the statutory language -- "so closely related to

24

25

banking as to be a proper incident thereto."
It is our contention in this case that the kind of
14

1

activities that the Board's regulation and interpretive ruling

2

have permitted here are activities that are prohibited to

3

banks under the Glass-Steagall Act.

4

direct contention with counsel for the Board.

5

In that respect we take

We submit that if those activities are prohibited

6

to banks by the fundamental national policy which is embodied

7

in the Glass-Steagall Act, then the Board may not lawfully

8

find that such activities are so closely related to banking

9

as to be a proper incident thereto.

10

This Court in 1971 in the Camp decision set aside a

1 1

regulation of the Comptroller of the Currency which authorized

12

national banks to create what amounted to open-end investment

13

companies denominated as commingled investment accounts.

14

Court held that such investment activity

15

by banks violated the Glass-Steagall Act.

16

21

--

The

company activity

Less than six weeks after this Court's decision
in Camp, the Board of Governors promulgated in preliminary form
the regulation here in issue.

And as I've indicated, that

regulation authorized bank holding companies and their affili­
ates to act as investment advisors to investment companies.
Now, it is our first proposition that the regulation
as applied to banks, and if it were to apply to banks, does
permit conduct which would be a direct violation of the GlassSteagall Act.

In order to illustrate that point it is neces­

sary to emphasize at the outset that what is involved here is
25

15

.

1

the sponsorship, with all that term implies, the sponsorship

2

by holding companies of investment companies.

3

issue is the only issue which is before the Court.

4

That narrow

After the decision of the District of Columbia

5

Circuit below, the Board of Governors petitioned the Court for

6

reconsideration, and specifically pointed out that the breadth

7

of the Court's order was to outlaw the mere furnishing of

8

investment advice as distinct from sponsoring of investment

9

companies, and protested the Court's order in that regard.

10

In direct response to this complaint the Court of

1 1

Appeals amended its opinion by adding a sentence to Footnote

12

13 which said, in substance, under the circumstances the Court

13

did not reach and should not be taken as expressing any

14

opinion on the question of whether bank holding companies or

15

their affiliates may either under the regulation in issue or

16

perhaps under one more narrowly drawn by the Board, could

17

render solely investment advice as distinct, in the Court's

18

words, "as distinct from sponsoring, organizing, managing, or

19

controlling such companies."

20
21

22
23
24

25

Accordingly, the question of providing mere invest­
ment advice to investment companies is not an issue here.

The

narrow issue before this Court is the lawfulness of a regula­
tion and the interpretive ruling which specifically permits
holding companies to sponsor investment companies.
Now, in order to understand the importance of that
16

1

distinction, I think it would be wise for me at this point to

2

set forth the significant role played by a sponsor in the

3

creation and organization and management of an investment

4

company, and the activities the sponsor engages in with

5

respect to the issuance and sale of securities by the invest­

6

ment company.

7

It is of fundamental importance in this regard to

8

recognize and understand that an investment company is typi­

9

cally a naked shell, whether it's in corporate form or whether

10

in trust form or some other form.

1 1

But the investment company itself has no officers, it has no

12

office, it has no office staff. All of the operating functions

13

of the typical investment company are supplied by the sponsor,

14

the investment adviser.

15

16

Usually it is corporate.

The Sponsor arranges for the incorporation, dr rather,
formation of the investment company.

The sponsor registers the

17

investment company with the Securities and Exchange Commission
18

under the investment Company Act of 1940 .

The sponsor regis­

19

ters the securities to be issued and sold by the investment
20
21

22

company with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933.
The sponsor contracts on behalf of the investment
company with an underwriter who will distribute the company's

23

securities to the investing public.

24

shows, and I believe this factor is of utmost importance, the

25

sponsor in many cases itself indemnifies the underwriter
17

As the record herein

1

against liabilities which the underwriter may incur under the

2

federal securities laws in connection with the distribution

3

of the investment company's securities.

4

Now, this practice is in sharp contrast with the

5

ordinary issue of

corporate securities by a manufacturing

6

corporation or a trading corporation such as a General Motors.

7

If General Motors issues securities, as it does regularly,

8

it of course must indemnify the underwriter and it and it

9

alone does indemnify the underwriter against these liabilities.

10

But in the case of an investment company, the sponsor as well,

1 1

in addition to the investment company, will issue the indemni­

12

fication.

13

to issue its shares for sale.

14

Thereafter the sponsor causes the investment company

Now, this initial activity of any investment company,

15

whether it's open-end or closed-end, centers on the issuance,

16

sale, and distrbution and underwriting of the securities of

17

the investment company.

18
19

20

21

22
23
24

25

Those four words are words taken

directly from Sections 21 and 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act.
It is this sale of securities which aggregates the capital
for the speculative investment activities in which the invest­
ment company will engage under the direction and management of
the sponsor.
As is summarized in the affidavit of Robert
Augenblick in the record herein, who at that time was president
of the respondent Investment Company Insitute, appearing at
18

1

Record 2283, paragraph 6, of that affidavit, the statement is

made:

bank to engage in this type of sponsor­

ship activity, sponsorship of an investment company, it would
be a direct violation of the Glass-Steagall Act.
There is some confusion in the record in this case
19

1

over the question of whether the Board's regulation purports

2

to authorize banks which are members of a holding company

3

complex in addition to bank holding companies and their non­

bank affiliates.

banks to engage in these sponsorship activities, notwithstand­

states that the term "bank holding companies" includes both

banks and non-bank subsidiaries and authorizes the activity

set forth -- notwithstanding that specific language, the Board

10

now takes the position that it did not intend in its ruling to

1 1

authorize banks to do anything under its regulation.

Whether the Board's order authorizes the

12

However, the record shows that while, from passage

13

of Glass-Steagall until 1971, no banks had sponsored closed-

14

end investment companies in this country, a flurry of closed-

15

end investment companies, many of which were sponsored by

16

banks, were organized following the Board's regulation, and

17

the prospectuses for a good many of those investment com­

18

panies, specifically referred to the Board's regulation as

19

authority for the banks to engage in the activities.

20

21
22
23
24

25

The Court of Appeals noted the ambiguity in the
Board's ruling but finally decided to accept the Board's cur­
rent explanation of its limited intent.

Now, however this

issue may be, we submit that the issue of whether banks may
lawfully act as sponsors to closed-end investment companies
is squarely presented in this case.
20

1

As counsel has indicated in his argument, and has

2

forcefully urged in the reply brief for the Board as well as

3

in the proceedings before the Board itself, the contention is

4

squarely made that banks may sponsor closed-end investment

5

companies provided they operate within the limitations and the

6

restrictions of the Board's rulings.

7

We submit, on the Contrary, that for a bank to

8

engage in the sponsorship of investment companies, to engage

9

in the activities which I have just recounted, would be a

10

direct violation of the Glass-Steagall Act.

11

follows that if conduct by a bank would be a direct violation

12

of the fundamental national policy of Glass-Steagall, then it

13

cannot be held that that activity is so closely related to

14

banking as to be the proper incident thereto.

15

16
17
18
19

We submit that it

Section 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act in terms pro­
hibits any bank from engaging in the business of issuing,
underwriting, selling, or distributing securities.

We submit

that the activities which I have outlined clearly constitute
the business of issuing and selling securities.

Without the

successful issuance and sale of these securities, as a matter
of fact, the investment company could not operate.

And as I

have noted, the sponsor is the only one to conduct those opera­
tions for the investment company.
Now, the Board urges that Section 21 would not be
violated by a bank because of the restrictions on the marketing

25

21

1

activity which counsel has referred to, and which are set forth

2

in the record.

3

the bank from engaging in the business of issuing, underwrit­

4

ing, selling, or distributing securities.

5

we have shown, during this initial organization and sponsor­

6

ship of a closed-end investment company, the principal busi­

7

ness of that company, indeed, virtually the only business of

8

the company and of its sponsor is the issuance and sale of

9

the investment company's securities.

It contends that those restrictions prevent

But for the reasons

This, we submit, is clearly engagement by the sponsor

10
1 1

in the business of issuing and selling securities within the

12

meaning of Section 21.
The other section of the Glass-Steagall Act which

13
14

would be violated by a bank which would engage in this spon­

15

sorship activity is Section 16, which is applicable to national

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

banks and state banks which are members of the Federal Reserve
System.

That section provides that the business of dealing in

securities and stock bv a national bank or a state member bank
shall be limited to purchasing and selling such securities
without

recourse, solely upon the order and for the account

of customers.
Now, with respect to this section, the Board contends
that the purchase and sale of securities for the investment
company, which as you read it involves purchases and sales
for a bank customer, as permitted by Section 16, the argument

25

22

1

is that a bank may create its own customer and then conduct

2

securities activites for that customer, and that is within an

3

exception set forth in Section 16.

4

We submit that this identical argument was submitted

5

to this Court back in 1970 with respect to the Camp decision,

6

where it was urged that the commingled investment fund created

7

by the bank in that case was nothing more than a bank customer

8

or perhaps the investors in that fund were a series of bank

9

customers and that what the bank was doing did not violate

10

Section 16.
In the Camp decision this Court clearly distinguished

1 1

12

between the activities of a bank in undertaking to purchase

13

stock for the account of its individual customers -- and

14

I'm quoting the language of the Court, there, on the one hand,

15

and again, in the language of the Court, the operation of an

16

investment fund on the other.
I am quoting from page 638 of the Court's opinion

17

18

in which the Court said, referring to certain hazards with

19

respect to bank involvement in investment company activity,

20
21

22
23
24

25

"These are all hazards that are not present when a bank under­
takes to purchase stock for the account of its individual
customers

or to commingle assets which it has received for

a true fiduciary purpose rather than for investment.

These

activities, unlike the operation of an investment fund,
do not give rise to a promotional or salesman's stake in a
2 3.

1

particular investment."

QUESTION:

You're reading from Camp?

MR. VIETH:

I am reading from Camp.

MR. VIETH:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

Mr. Justice Blackmun who did dissent.

"They do not involve

8

an enterprise in direct competition with aggressively promoted

and so forth.
And then the Court concluded:

1 1

"In short, there is a

12

plain difference between the sale of fiduciary services and

13

the sale of investments."

14

tion .

And that is the end of the quota­

We submit that, for the same reason that this Court

15

16

rejected that argument in Camp, it should be rejected in this

17

case.

18
19

21

22

25

QUESTION:

Camp didn't deal with this kind of hold­

ing company though, did it?
MR. VIETH:

No, sir, Camp dealt with an open-end

fund that was directly sponsored by the hank.
We submit also that a reading of the legislative
history of the Glass-Steagall Act suggests that the formation
of investment companies of this kind was one of the evils that
the Congress was concerned with, particularly when it was
24

1

dealing with so-called bank affiliates.

2

proceedings, particularly the hearings before the Subcommittee

3

of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, the landmark

4

hearings with respect to Glass-Steagall in the 71st Congress,

5

an intensive investigation of security affiliates was under­

6

taken .

In the legislative

referred to by the Congress under item 4 in: those hearings is
exactly the same kind of an affiliate that's involved in this
case, namely a closed-end investment company which buys and
sells securities acquired purely for investment or speculative
purposes.
Now, as the Board has indicated and as the record
shows, the Board has drawn a distinction between sponsorship
of closed-end funds and sponsorship of open-end funds.
25

1

The Board concedes that sponsorship of an open-end

2

fund is prohibited, but it holds that a sponsorship of a

3

closed-end fund is permitted.

4

overwhelming majority of investment companies and investment

5

trusts which were in existence in 1929 and 1930 at the time

6

the Glass-Steagall legislation was being considered, the over­

7

whelming majority of them were closed-end funds.

8

the SEC records which are cited at page 27 of our brief show

9

that of all assets held by investment companies in 1929 and

And yet, the fact is that the

In fact,

10

1930, 95 percent were closed-end companies and only five per­

1 1

cent were open-end companies.
So we submit that not only does the language of

12
13

Glass-Steagall prohibit bank sponsorship of closed-end invest­

14

ment companies, but the legislative history discloses that

15

Congress clearly intended to prohibit that sponsorship.

16

And this Court's Camp decision, of course, is squarely in

17

point.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Now, we come then to the second leg of our argument.
If in fact banks are prohibited from sponsoring closed-end
investment companies, as we submit unmistakably

they

are,

then we further submit that the Board may not lawfully under
Section 4(c)(8) permit bank holding companies to engage in
those identical activities on the ground that they are
I'm quoting the statute, "so closely related to banking as to
be a proper incident thereto."
26

1

Counsel for the Board argues that bank holding

2

company legislation was intended to permit the Board to

3

authorize activities in which banks may not engage.

4

of course, is true, to a limited extent.

5

Act does permit the Board to authorize holding companies to

6

engage in activities which would be ultra vires of banking.

7

But what is involved in this case is something far more than

8

activities which would be merely ultra vires.

And that

What is involved here are activities that are specif­

9

10

ically prohibited by the fundamental national policy which is

1 1

embodied in Glass-Steagall,

12

we submit it would be illegal for a bank to engage in.

13

It is our position that under Section 4(c)(8) the standard

14

of closely related and proper incident cannot be met by per­

tively prohibited to banks themselves.
We believe that the legislative history of the 1956

17
18

acts

Act and the manner in which it was administered by the Board
following passage makes this clear.

As a matter of fact,

Chairman Martin -- William McChesney Martin -- was Chairman of
the Board at the time the 1956 Holding Company Act was passed,
and was chairman of the board throughout its entire adminis­
tration right until the 1970 amendments to that Act were
passed.

Chairman Martin testified in 1969 in connection with

the 1970 amendments, in referring to the Holding Company Act,
25

27

1

he said, "The Congress took steps years ago in the Banking Act

2

of 1933" -- I interpolate, the Glass-Steagall Act — "to

3

separate banking from non-banking businesses,

4

reinforced by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as to

5

companies that owned two or more banks."

policy that was

6

I think Chairman Martin was clearly correct, that

7

the Congress in passing the Holding Company Act intended to

8

reinforce the policies and principles of the Glass-Steagall-

9

Act.

10

So far as is known, no holding company attempted to

1 1

sponsor an investment company, closed-end or open-end, during

12

the period between 1956 and 1970. And we think it is quite

13

clear that the 1956 Act would not have permitted that sort of

14

activity.

15

1970 amendments to Section 4(c)(8) somehow or other demon­

16

strated a congressional intent to broaden the power

17

20

21

24

Now, as the Court below noted, there was a massive

18
19

The only question remaining, then, is whether the

struggle in connection with the 1970 amendments between the
congressional proponents of much broadened permissible
activities for bank holding companies, and the congressional
opponents of such broadening, and who intended to restrict
even further the permissible activity of bank holding
companies.
In the middle of that struggle, I might say, was the
28

1

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which came

2

down on the side of some broadening and suggested that the

3

language so closely related to banking as to be an incident

4

thereto, be eliminated and that a functionally belated test

5

be substituted.

6

that legislative struggle an attempt was made to resolve by

7

congressional action the very issue which was wending its way

8

through the Federal Court system and ultimately decided by

9

this court in 1971, in the Camp case.

I might also say that during the course of

And I might say that in submitting that proposed

19

middle ground, the Board suggested that one of the types of

20

activities that in its view would be within the standard of

21

"functionally related," was acting as an investment advisor to

22

investment companies.

23
24

25

The Senate basically had been in favor of the broad­
ening of the activities permissible to bank holding companies,
the House of Representatives on the other hand was more or
29

1

less determined not to permit the broadening.

2

the bill that passed the House of Representatives contained a

3

so-called negative laundry list specifically outlawing certain

4

types of activities to bank holding companies and banks and

5

their affiliates.

6

laundry list was the kind of activity involved in this case,

7

the sponsorship of investment companies.

And one of the items on the negative

But I think that the important

10

thing for this Court to recognize is that the language of

Section 4(c)(8) insofar as it's relevant to this proceeding

12

remained exactly the same.

standard.

There was only one change and that is that

And it's quite clear that that deletion was made

solely to overcome a series of rulings by the Board which pre­
viously had held under the 1956 Act that the activities which
were lawful for a bank holding company had to be related
directly to the banks which were owned or controlled by that
holding company.

In other words, the holding companies could

not engage broadly in that type of activity but had to limit
their activities to support of the very banks in their own
