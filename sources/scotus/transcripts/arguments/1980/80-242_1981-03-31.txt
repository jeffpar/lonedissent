ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari

10

to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of

11

Columbia Circuit.

12

has granted a statutory right to trial by jury in suits

13

against the Federal Government under Section 15(c) of the

14

Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

15

discrimination on the basis of age in employment by private

16

employers as well as by the Federal Government and state and

17

local governments.

18

tain the substantive and remedial provisions generally appli­

19

cable to private employers and to state and local governments.

20

Section 7 of the Act deems age discrimination by these em­

21

ployers to be violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and

22

provides for enforcement in accordance with powers, remedies,

23

and procedures contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. Sec­

24

tion 7(c) then authorizes .aspersan: aggrieved

25

mination by private employers and state and local governments

The question presented is whether Congress

That Act prohibits

The first 14 sections of the Act con­

3

by

age discri­

1

to bring civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction

2

for appropriate equitable or legal relief.

3

pressly provides for trial by jury in suits under that sec­

4

tion.

Section 7(c) ex­

The United States is expressly excluded from the

5

6

definition of the term "employer" as that term is used in the

7

first 14 sections of the Age Discrimination act.

8

age discrimination in federal employment is separately

9

addressed in Section 15.

Instead,

For example, Subsection (a) of

10

Section 15 states a distinct substantive prohibition providing

11

that all personnel actions in the Federal Government are to

12

be made free of discrimination on the basis of age.

13

tion (b) then empowers the' Civil Service

14

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after the reor­

15

ganization plan, to enforce this prohibition through appro­

16

priate remedies including reinstatement or hiring with or

17

without back pay.

18

aggrieved by employment discrimination in the federal sector

to bring a civil action in any federal district court of

20

competent jurisdiction for appropriate legal or equitable

21

relief.

trial right.

Subsec­

Commission, now

Section 15(c) then authorizes a person

Section 15(c), unlike Section 7(c) applicable to the

Respondent brought this action under the Age Dis­
crimination Act in 1978, alleging discrimination by the
4

1

Secretary of Navy and certain subordinate officials.

2

ing to the complaint, respondent’s permanent position was abol­

3

ished in 1975 and she worked for the’next three years in another posi­

4

tion on a continuing but temporary basis'.

5

cials of the Department had denied her reassignment and promo­

6

tional opportunities on the basis of age during that three-

7

year period.

8
9

Accord­

She alleged that. offi­

To remedy that alleged discrimination she sought in
this case a retroactive promotion as well as an award of

10

back pay measured by the difference between what she actually

11

earned and what she would have earned in the Department of

12

the Navy in the absence of the alleged discrimination.

13

Respondent demanded a jury trial on her age discrimi­

14

nation claim.

The Government moved to strike that demand for

15

a jury trial.

The district court denied 'the Government’s mo­

16

tion to strike concluding that Congress intended to permit jury

17

trials against the Federal Government under Section 15.

18

district court did however certify the jury trial issue for

19

interlocutory appeal under 28 USC 1292(b).

20

appeals granted the petition for interlocutory review.

21

The court of appeals observed

The

The court of

that

the

Seventh

22

Amendment guarantee of trial by jury does not apply in this

23

case because that guarantee does not apply in suits against

24

the Federal Government.

25

that there is .no explicit statutory grant of the jury trial

The Court of Appeals also acknowledged

5

1

right in Section 15.

2

cluded that a right to jury trial could be inferred in Sectior

3

15.

4

jury trial right could be inferred from the fact that Congress

5

had provided for these suits against the Federal Government

6

to be brought in federal district court rather than in the

7

Court of Claims.

8
9

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals con­

It relied on two factors.

First, it concluded that the

Second, the court found this inference from the
federal jurisdictional grant in the federal district courts

10

to be strengthened by the fact that Section 15 authorizes

11

the court to award legal or equitable relief.

QUESTION':'

Mr. Kneedler, how did the Court of Ap­

peals distinguish the Federal Tort
MR. KNEEDLER:

Claims Act?

As I recall, the Court of Appeals

15

did not expressly address the question of the Federal Tort

16

Claims Act.

17
18

QUESTION:

Yet the Federal Tort Claims Act provides

for suits against the Government but does not allow jury tria s.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

•

But

That's correct.
it's

express in the Tort Claims

Act, is it not?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, yes, what -- this is now codi­

23

fied in 28 United States Code 2402, that suits against the

24

Federal Government under 1346 are to be tried without a jury

25

with one exception, that's in tax refund suits.
6

But the

1

origin of that prohibition is in the Tucker Act of 1887 and

2

in the original Tucker Act one house of Congress had provided

3

that jury trials, had permanently authorized jury trials in

4

those claims that were; brought .in district courts at that

5

time and as well in the circuit courts, and that one house had

6

expressly granted it, the other house had expressly prohibited

7

it. So that it's not surprising that

8

agreement between the two houses that Congress expressly re­

9

solved it and barred jury trials in suits under the Tucker

in resolving the dis­

10

Act.

In fact, we believe that’s strongly indicative of

11

Congress's intent in these matters.

12

actually focused on the question, it resolved the question

13

against the availability of jury trial.
QUESTION:

14
15

traditional terms?

16

the United States?

But is this a suit at common law in the
Was there a suit at common law against

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

It was not.

When its attention was

No, there was not.

No, in that sense,

18

no.

This Court held a hundred years ago in the

19

McElrath decision that the Seventh Amendment has no applica­

20

tion in suits against the sovereign because suits against the

21

sovereign were unknown at common law or at the very least, if

22

they could be analogized to common law, it could not. have

23

been asserted that the jury trial right that was preserved "■

24

In the. Seventh Amendment contemplated a jury trial right

25

against the Federal Government.
7

So it is not a suit at

1

common law.
Just to complete my answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's

2
3

question, in the legislative history of the Tort Claims Act

4

Congress simply picked up the bar to jury trials that was

5

contained in the Tucker Act and decided to incorporate it in

6

the Tort Claims Act, and in fact in consideration of the Tort

7

Claims Bill in 1940 in the House there was a proposal to

8

amend the bill to allow jury trials and that was defeated,

9

again by reference to the Tucker Act.
So the provisions barring

10

jury trials in our view

11

reflect that when Congress focuses on the question it decides

12

it does not want jury, trials..

13

appeals plainly erred in finding the jury trial right in

14

Section 15 of the Age Discrimination Act.

15

these suits are not suits covered by the Seventh Amendment.

16

Respondent concedes as much and the Court of Appeals so held.

17

Accordingly, there

18

Congress has affirmatively recognized that right.

19

concedes this as well, and in fact this conclusion is compelle d

20

by Rule 38(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

21

38(a) where the Seventh Amendment does not apply there is no

22

right to trial by jury in any civil action brought in federal

23

district court except as given by a statute of the United

24

States.

There is nothing in the text, the legislative his­

8

1

Act to suggest that Congress intended to grant a right to trial by-

2

jury in suits against the Federal Government. To the contrary, all

3

the indicia of congressional intent point in the opposite direction.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, I gather the Government’s position

anyway is that it has to be explicit, isn't it?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10
11

12

Yes.

You can't find it by implication?
That's right.

Our position is that

it does have to be explicit and —
QUESTION:

It could be implicit even among private

parties, as in Parklane Hosiery.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, that's correct.

A right to —

13

of course, in a suit between private parties where the Seventl

14

Amendment applies.

15
16

QUESTION:

Right; right.
But the reason, it has to be explicit

when it's an action against the United States Government.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

19

20

That's right.

That's right.

That's the only time in your argument

that it has to be explicit.
MR.

KNEEDLER:

That's correct; yes.

We're not ad­

21

dressing the question of suits against private parties, nor

22

where the Seventh Amendment applies, or, for instance, the

23

application of principles of collateral estoppel.

24

looking at the --

25

QUESTION:

Well, in

May I ask you one question that's brought
9

1

to mind that, what would you say about a suit against an

2

officer of the United States, the Attorney General or some­

3

one, in his official capacity, seeking damages of a Bivens

4

character, something like that?
MR. KNEEDLER:

5

Well, if it’s a Bivens-type action,

6

then that is a suit, that would be a suit while arising out

7

of his official duties^ it's a suit in his personal capacity.

8

When an officer is personally liable under no situation is it

9

our understanding that the Seventh Amendment itself would

10

guarantee a right to trial by jury.
QUESTION:

11

Is there -- maybe I'm just totally off

12

base.

13

in his official capacity -— then it would be like a suit

14

against the United States?

15

Is there a possibility of an action against someone

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct it would be deemed

16

a suit against the United States, which would invoke all ‘

17

normal rules as if the United States were the injured party.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

And the doctrine

coming from Ex Parte

Young was only in equity, it wasn't a suit for damages?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

In looking at the

21

congressional intent under Section 15 we must of course start

22

with the language of the Act itself.

23

Section 15(c) contains no reference to jury trials.

24

7(c) on the other hand, which applies to .civil actions brought

25

against all other employers covered by the Act, expressly
10

As I mentioned before,
Section

Therefore, Congress has demonstrate d

1

provides for jury trials.

2

in the very statute that's under consideration here that it

3

knows how to provide for a right to a jury trial when it wants

4

to do so, and yet declined to grant that right in suits

5

against the Federal Government.

6

Under settled principles of statutory construction,

7

then, we submit, the conclusion to be drawn is that there is

8

no such right under Section 15(c).

9

QUESTION:

You could turn that argument around,

10

could you not, and say' that in the Federal Tort Claims Act

11

it knew how to bar the right to jury trials and when it has

12

not done so there is a right to jury trial?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, under Rule 38

14

certainly now the question we believe has to be whether Con­

15

gress affirmatively granted it, granted the right, because

16

Rule 38 provides for trial by jury

17

Seventh Amendment, whereas given by an act of Congress the

18

mere absence of a prohibition does not in our view constitute

19

the grant of a right to trial by jury, particularly when con­

20

sidered against the background of Congress's general practice

21

of not.granting a right to trial'by j ury in, for instance, the

22

complete range of cases subject to the Tucker Act, which in­

23

cludes all monetary claims under the Constitution under any

24

statute, under any contract, and all claims for liquidated

25

or unliquidated damages

sounding
11

guaranteed by the

in

tort.

That is a broad

1

jurisdictional grant.

2

QUESTION:

Was Rule 38 or its predecessor, did it

3

say the same thing at the time of the enactment of the

4

Federal Tort Claims Act?

5

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

the Federal Tort Claims Act

was enacted in 1946.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Well,

In '46 or ’47, I think.
And the Rules of Civil Procedure

were adopted, I believe, in 1937 or 1938.

But, as I say,

10

the committee reports on the Tort Claims Act do not really

11

discuss the question.

12

them, there was no reference to the fact that if we don't

13

prohibit it, it's granted.

14

QUESTION:

For instance, in my quick looking at

Well, under your argument, Congress

15

didn't need to provide, explicitly provide what it did

16

provide?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

It simply picked up

18

the preexisting provision in the Tucker Act because the last

19

phrase that I quoted was from the Tucker Act, referred to

20

suits for liquidated or unliquidated damages not sounding in

21

tort,,

22

filling a gap in the Tucker Act and so it was natural that it

23

would also invoke the jury trial prohibition, but. I don't think

24

any inference can be drawn that' it thought it'had: to prohibit --

25

and Congress in the Tort Claims Act was effectively

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, as I recall it, Lorillard

12

1

emphasized legal relief in 7(c), didn't it, as a basis for

2

the conclusion that jury trial was intended there.

3

"legal relief" also appear in 15(c), don't they?
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

The words

Yes, they do, Mr. Justice Brennan.

5

But in Lorillard the Supreme Court, this Court, enphasized the

6

use of the word "legal" by reference to its accepted connota­

7

tion under the Seventh Amendment.

8

suits for legal relief, when legal issues are to be decided,

9

the Seventh Amendment ordinarily requires a right to trial

The Court stated that in

10

by jury.

The Court then concluded that Congress must have

11

been aware of this interpretation and intended that when it

12

used the word "legal" to receive into the Age Act the jury

13

trial right that ordinarily attaches because of the Seventh

14

Amendment.

15

That analysis, we subm.it, has no application here,

16

because the Seventh Amendment doesn't apply to suits against

17

the Federal Government, and therefore by using the word

18

"legal" Congress could not be expected to have attached any

19

significance to it for jury trial purposes.

20

against the background of the Tort Claims Act and the Tucker

21

Act, even in suits that are concededly of a type that would

22

entitle a private party to a jury trial, Congress has estab­

23

lished a different

Government and it's consistent with this practice for Congress

not to have affirmatively provided a jury trial right in suits

QUESTION:

2

And I notice we have an amicus brief

from a number of Senators and Congressmen, or all they all

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

6

I believe they're all Congressmen;

yes.

They seem to think

bill or not.

It doesn't say whether they voted on this

I don't find that.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I didn't trace whether each of them

did.

I think it's a familiar principle, though, that the

QUESTION:

Even when there were that many?

16

QUESTION:

This is one step removed, you suggest,

17

from the usual post-events legislative history?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, I would submit that it is.

How many years removed would this be?
Oh, this -- the Act was extended to

21

the Federal Goverment in 1974 so this would be six years,

22

seven years.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Quite a few of these, I think, were there:

Claude Pepper, for example.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Congressman Pepper certainly
14

1

2

was in office -QUESTION:

Rule 38, by its terms, certainly -- at

3

least the copy I have, is maybe outdated -- doesn't expressly

4

bar a jury trial in a claim against the United States.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but it does say, in the basic

6

provisions dealing with jury trials, that there should be a

7

right to jury trial as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment

8

or as given by a statute of the United States.

9

a party does not fall into one of those two categories, then

10

-- or if a case does not, then it would seem a party to that

11

case does not have a right to demand a jury trial.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Absent -- if

Well, but then doesn't the Seventh

Amendment come into play?
MR. KNEEDLER:

In a suit against the Federal

15

Government?

16

certainly would and you wouldn't even have to get to the ques­

17

tion of whether an Act of Congress had granted the right to

18

trial by jury if the suit is one that falls under the

19

Seventh Amendment guarantee.

20
21
22

I mean, in a suit against a private party it

QUESTION:

You say, then, that 38 simply doesn't

apply to the Federal Government?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh, it does apply, but what it re­

23

quires is that you find, not that the Seventh Amendment does

24

not apply to the Federal Government, so that part of the jury

25

trial right that's preserved in Rule 38Ca) does not apply to
15

1

the Federal Government.

2

a right to trial by jury in a suit against the Federal Govern­

3

ment, then that comes in under the second provision in

4

Rule 38(a) that there’s a right to trial by jury as given by

5

a statute of the United States.

6

certainly does apply.

7

of Rule 38 to some statutes to find an affirmative grant of

8

jury trial.

9

QUESTION:

But if Congress affirmatively grants

So, in that sense, Rule

38

It just requires you to look outside

Well, how about Curtis v. Loether and

10

the other, the District of Columbia case and the 7th Circuit

11

case where the right to trial by jury wasn't given by statute,

12

but this Court found it was given by the Seventh Amendment?

13

HR. KNEEDLER:

That’s correct; yes.

But those cases

14

would have no application here because the Seventh Amendment

15

does not apply to suits against the United States.

16

speaking of suits against the United States , in which it has

17

been settled by this Court that there's no right given by

18

the Seventh Amendment to trial by jury.

19

We’re only

QUESTION: But isn’t your reading of Rule 38 just a

20

way of saying, the question is whether a right to trial by

21

jury is or is not given by a statute?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That’s right.

That's the issue.
That’s right.

So that Rule 38 doesn't add or subtract

from anything as I see it.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think that's basically
16

1

correct.

2

that seems to be principally relied upon for the proposition

3

that providing for suits to be brought in federal district

4

court implies a right to trial by jury against the United

5

States was a case by the name of' United . States v. Pfitsch,

6

which is, for instance,

7

Moore treatise for that proposition.

8

The only reason I mention it is because the case

the only authority cited in the

But Pfitsch arise prior to the adoption of Rule 38

9

and its analysis was not really that the Lever Act, which

10

was the statute involved in that case, itself contained a

11

grant of the jury trial right.

12

there was something in the nature of district court jurisdic­

13

tion that provided a right to trial by jury, and we think it's

14

clear, whatever the rule would have been before the adoption

15

of Rule 38(a), that there is no general inherent right to

16

trial by jury in civil actions in federal district court,

17

that Rule 38Ca) establishes a mechanism for determining when

18

there is such a right, and, namely, whether the Seventh Amend­

19

ment applies, or you have to look to the statute for a grant

20

of the jury trial right.

21

whatever the application of Pfitsch may have been at a prior

22

time, Rule 38(.a) requires that you look to a statute.

23

It seemed to be more that

And so, to that extent I think that

Aside from the face of the statute itself, which

24

as I mentioned distinguishes on its face suits against

25

the Federal Government, I think it’s also significant that
17

1

there's not one mention in the legislative history of a

2

reference to trial by jury in suits against the Federal

3

Government.

telling against the general practice of Congress not provid­

5

ing for jury trials in those case.

6

situation of"which we are aware in which Congress has actually

7

granted a right to trial by jury is in tax refund suits

against the Federal Government brought in federal district

court.

This is -- we think this silence is particularly

Indeed, the most recent

Congress affirmatively granted a right to trial by

jury in such suits in 1954.
But the House,

at that time, for example, viewed

12

this as" .a harmful precedent if Congress was‘going to provide

13

for jury trial in suits against the Federal Government

14

generally, and the House's resistance was sufficiently strong

15

that it held up the reporting out of the conference committee

16

of a bill authorizing jury trials for almost a year.

17

The House finally acceded to the provision in the Senate bill

18

because of special situations involved in tax refund suits.

19

We think that this demonstrates that when Congress focuses

20

on the question, at the very least it generates controversy

21

within the Congress, and surely if Congress had intended to

22

depart from its normal practice in the Age Discrimination Act

23

we would expect some debate on it, instead we have silence.

as a matter of statutory construction a right to trial by jury

under Section 7, was the incorporation of the Fair Labor

lied in Lorillard, subsequently relied; it adopted the Title

nized in suits brought under Title VII, even against private

17

employers.

18

In other words, not only did Congress reject the

So that the only inference that can be drawn from

19

the way in which Congress structured Section 15 is that it

20

did not intend for there to be a right to trial by jury.

21

this inference drawn from the manner in which Section 15 was

22

formulated in 1974 was only strengthened in 1978, we submit,

23

when Congress amended the statute in a number of respects.

24
25

And

First, as I have pointed out, it was in 1978 that
Congress amended Section 7 to provide for the jury trial right
20

1

in suits under that section and didn't under Section 15.

2

Beyond that, Congress enacted a new subsection (f) in Section

3

15 dealing with federal employment, which provides that per­

4

sonnel actions in the federal sector are not to be subject to

5

or affected by any other provision of the Act except one pro­

6

vision in Section 12 dealing with the upper age limit for

7

federal employees.

8

this new subsection (f) makes clear that Section 15 is inde­

9

pendent of any other provision of the Act.

And the conference report states that

Subsection (f) and the jury trial provision in

10
11

private sector cases were both considered by the conference

12

committee.

13

submit that given this reminder, very vivid reminder in the

14

new Subsection (f), that Section 15 is entirely separate and

15

does not incorporate the types of procedures and remedies that

16

are available in

17

Section 7.

18

that Congress enacted a jury trial right under Section 7 and

19

not under Section 15, we again think

20

it could not have overlooked, given the separate nature of

21

these provisions, it could not have overlooked the need to

22

amend Section 15 if it had chosen to do so.

23

that, as I mentioned, Pfitsch also seems to depend on the

notion that there is something inherent in district court

right, but there was a right that somehow attached because

14

the case was brought in federal court.

of law in federal district court.

21

that there is not a right to trial by jury unless: the Seventh

statute of Congress.

QUESTION:

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Now, since Pfitsch was

What's your authority for that?
Well, 'I think one explanation for

this is that at the time Pfitsch was decided there was the

2

former 2 8 United States Code 77 0 which provided a statutory-

3

right for trial by jury in suits at law in the federal dis­

trict courts.

ground.

It was essentially unnecessary because

It was contained in the original Judiciary

Act of 1789.

But Rule 38 made it largely unnecessary because

Rule 38 expressly itself protects the jury trial right.

12

Well, if this, statute specifically

there would be no jury trial in suits against the

statute is silent, then the instructional guidance set out by

I believe that the petitioner

confuses

doctrine of sovereign immunity from jury trials.

Government is sued and the

24

1

this Court in Pfitsch, Law, Wickwire, and the accord in

2

Galloway makes no sense, because in all of those instances

3

the analysis set out by the Supreme Court was that where you

4

had a case that was considered an action at law and there was

5

exclusive jurisdiction in the district court, at least with

6

respect to Law and Pfitsch, the conclusion was that Congress

7

intended a right to jury trial.

8
9

Now, this is precisely what the circuit court of
appeals found when it went to the language of Section 15.

As

10

petitioner has indicated to you, there was heavy reliance by

11

the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia on the fact

12

that Section 15(c) talks about exclusive jurisdiction in the

13

federal district courts.

14

The second reliance is the fact that Section 15(c)

15

is identical in its language to section 7(c) and this Court re

16

lied upon the language, legal relief.

17

writing for the majority in Lorillard found that the Congress is

18

imputed with having knowledge'of the well 'developed common law

19

meaning of the term, legal relief.

20

that Congress knows what it’s doing when it uses certain

21

terms and therefore on that basis as well as other bases this

22

Court concluded a right to jury trial under 7(c).

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Ms.

Mr. Justice Marshall

And therefore concluded

Barry, I suppose there was no Lever

Act, as involved in the Pfitsch case, at common law in 1791?

BARRY:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

that dealt with compensation, when the Government was- setting

2

up requisitions for — I think it occurred during World War I.

3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MS. BARRY:

And I don’t think that kind of writ

5

could be obtained in the common law courts of the King, back

6

in 1789 and 1791.

7

Section 15, to quote this Court in Pfitsch, "All difficulties

8

of construction vanish if we-are'willing'to give to the words

9

of Section 15, 'deliberately, adopted,r their natural meaning.

Now, again referring to the language of

I have already addressed myself to the language of

10
11

the fact that legal relief is contained in Section 15(c).

12

And again I want to add that it states identically the same

13

statement that is found in Section 7(c), that is a person

14

aggrieved by age discrimination in the federal sector of em­

15

ployment is entitled to bring a civil action in a federal

16

district court for such legal and equitable relief as will

17

effectuate the purposes of this chapter, this chapter being

18

the ADEA.

19

Now, petitioner claims that Section 15 is really

20

different, that it was really modeled after Title VII. Well,

21

as, again in Lorillard, as Justice Marshall noted, Section 4

22

of the ADEA which contains the prohibitions against age dis­

23

crimination were lifted, or derived, in haec verba, from the

24

prohibitions found in 42 USC 2000(e)-2(a)(1).

25

Court said, aside from the fact that there is Title VII
26

But this

1

overlay and that there is language found from Title VII,

2

you've got to go to the remedies and procedures.

3

in Section 15, as well as Section 15(c), there is a dramatic

4

departure from what is found in Title VII, just as there is a

5

dramatic departure from what is found in Title VII in the

6

Section 7 or the other portion of the ADEA.

7

And what is that?

And in here,

There is an opportunity to by­

8

pass the administrative remedy set out in Section 15(b) for

9

the federal employee and there is significantly the right

10

to seek legal relief.

11

ously absent in Title VII.

12

Title VII of any description of relief is the equitable re­

13

lief.

14

That term "legal relief" is conspicu­
The only mention you have in

Now, the petitioner at page 38 of his brief says

15

that

16

gress the common law meaning of legal relief when it is found

17

in Section 15(c) because Congress and the Seventh Amendment

18

have always treated the issue of jury trial differently in

19

the context of actions at law against the Government.

20

we shodld not'’ascribe or we should not impute to Con­

Well, the Seventh Amendment has no applicability

21

here because once sovereign immunity is waived that drops

22

out of the picture, and then the ordinary principles of sta­

23

tutory construction obtain.

QUESTION:

And, furthermore, in the 3rd Circuit, in that

13

determinants found by the Court of Appeals here in the

14

District of Columbia and here in Miss Nakshian's case, con­

15

cluding that there was the right to a jury trial.

16

Now, with respect to how Congress has treated the

17

issue of jury trials differently, I'm uncertain what is meant

18

by that language except that there have been instances, as

19

the petitioner has submitted in his argument, where Congress

20

has expressly denied a right to jury trial.

But in those instances Congress was already respond­

6

Appeals on the fact that there was exclusive jurisdicion in

8

the district courts, again

9

of the jurisdiction of the district court is of importance

Pfitsch states that the nature

10

not only because of the questions directly involved but

11

because the answer given to it will determine incidentally

12

whether plaintiffs who proceed under Section 10 are entitled

13

to a jury trial.

14

jurisdiction in the district court establishes as an incident

15

a right to a jury trial, and that has subsequently been fol­

16

lowed by other courts of appeals including the Collins case,

17

Whitney v. United States, Hacker v. United States.

18

And then it went on to hold that exclusive

Now, the petitioner for the first time, before the

19

Supreme Court argued that the language found in Section 15(f)

20

means that the other rights, remedies, and procedures set out

21

on the other section of the Act do not apply to actions brougl ,t

22

by persons aggrieved by federal age discrimination.

23
24
25

Your Honors, if we follow the logic of what the
petitioner is saying, we will in effect have a situation where
courts will be completely left without guidance as to what

29

1

the rights, remedies, and procedures are with respect to

2

federal ADEA cases.

However, they're saying by the

3

that the reason that Congress didn’t bother to amend 15(c) in

5

purpose of the '78 amendments was not being focused on the

6

right of

from Congress over to the Senate for deliberation, and at

12

Now, we contend

It is codified at Section

The reason, I contend, that Congress did not bother

13

to amend Section 15(c) at the same time is not because they

14

were deliberately going to deny a right of jury trial to par­

15

ties bringing actions involving the Federal Government, simply

16

because it would have been mere surplusage.

17

bother defining the prohibitions of age discrimination in

18

Section 15; didn't bother defining the statute of limitations

19

— that’s found in 29 USC 255; didn't bother instructing the

20

Court as to the specificity of legal and equitable relief

21

found in Section 7(b); didn’t bother telling the Government

22

23

QUESTION:

Congress didn't

Well, Ms. Barry, you can see our diffi­

24

culty with the case is that it would have been so easily

25

resolved by Congress if it had said there will be a right to
31

1

jury trial or there won't be a right to jury trial.

2

we’re left with a kind of fuzzy legislative history and impli­

3

cations and that sort of thing.

4

MS. BARRY:

And here

Which is exactly why I think we’re be­

5

fore this Court today is that the problem, I believe, that

6

came up in October of '77 was, first of all, the focus of the

7

'78 amendments was on the mandatory retirement age and then

8

eliminating the upper age ceiling for federal employees.

9

wanted to expand the rights of federal employees and in fact

They

10

did so to a greater degree than they did for people covered

11

under the other sections of the Act.

12

For example, all you have to do is bb 4 0 and you're pro­

13

tected under the ADEA if you're a federal employee or a per­

14

son aggrieved by the federal sector of employment.

15

you do have restrictions, qualifications set out in other

16

portions of the ADEA that we contend Section 15(f) means you

17

don't apply it to federal employees.

18

retire at 70 or if

19

you're not going to have, I think it's Section 12(c) or 12(d)

20

applied to you.

21

However,

For example, having to

you're a professor, maybe teaching at NIH,

I think that was the focus.

Furthermore, the only cases coming up at that time

22

— you have to keep in mind, I think, Your Honor, that in

23

1967 the Age Act had been around for a number of years.

24

7

so to speak, found itself perfectly able to say, there shall

be no right of jury trial.

9

or the other in this Act.
MS. BARRY:

10

And it could have .gone one way

Your Honor, I think I can distinguish

11

that situation, because the Federal Tort Claims Act at 1346(b)

12

is simply that one section found under a general statute that

13

did not allow jury trials in the first place.

14

be distinguished here because there is the standard principle

15

of statutory construction that says acts are construed in

16

pari materia

17

fashion, I think that Congress automatically assumes that all

18

of the other sections of the Act, 1 through 14, 16 and 17,

19

would automatically be applied to Section 15 unless you end

20

up with absurd results —

4(f)(2) defense set up by employers under the — you know,

22

with all the involuntary retirements that were occurring under

23

the pension benefits set out in Section 4(f)(2) of the Act.

24

With respect to the legislative history, in March

25

in

the

legislative history that indicates that

In fact, the 1974

employees.

Again, in 1978,

15, 1974, HR 93-9113, it stated that the committee expects
34

1

that expanded coverage under the Age Discrimination in Employ­

2

ment law will remove discriminatory barriers against employ­

3

ment of older workers in government jobs at the federal and

4

local government levels, as it has and continues to do in pri­

5

vate employment.
Now, this is important because in '74 the law was

6
7

amended to include all public employers.

8

ployers were included by simply amending the definitions, I

9

believe, found in 630.

However, public em­

Section 15 came in to give jurisdic­

10

tion to the Civil Service Commission, not because there was

11

an absolute analysis of Section 15 to Section 717, but only

12

because the Civil Service Commission had historically had

13

jurisdiction over all kinds of matters regarding federal em-

14

ployees.

15

and then, simultaneously in 1974, was given jurisdiction of

16

FLSA claims.

17

It clearly at that time had Title VII jurisdiction

Now, the Reorganization Act, I contend, to a certain

18

extent has mooted that distinction, because the Civil Service

19

Commission no longer has jurisdiction of the Title VII com­

20

plaints nor of ADEA complaints.

21

quishment of the DOL jurisdiction over ADEA claims, has been

22

sent over to the EEOC.

23

24

the fact that there was not uniformity of result being ob­

1

trying to administer the antidiscrimination statutes for var­

ious employers.

3

over to EEOC is because EEOC has a long history and expertise

4

in administering and resolving complaints of discrimination.

5

If we use the reasoning of petitioner of Section 15(f), then

6

we will obtain wholly incongruous results in that that desire

7

of President Carter will not be met by the reorganization

plan.

Mrs. Barry.

MS. BARRY:

20

Your Honors, I believe one of the Justices asked

Thank you, Your Honor.

21

Mr. Kneedler whether or not all of the Congresspeople whose

22

names appear as amici on the brief had voted on the '78 amend­

23

ments.

Mr. Jeffords, aside from those three or possibly four, all of

It was brought to my attention that except for

QUESTION:

MS. BARRY:

4

Your Honor.

Oh, only in response to that question,

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

5

What difference does it make?

You don't suggest it makes any difference

6

whether they express that view as members of Congress, later

7

members of Congress, or future members of Congress, do you?
MS. BARRY:

8
9

Well, Your Honor, I thought that in

response to the Justice's question that perhaps the intent,

10

those who wrote up the '78 amendments, who were close to the

11

law and writing up the Conference reports surrounding HR -QUESTION:

12
13

In order to do that, the best way would

be to take a poll of the Congress, wouldn't it?
MS. BARRY:

14

Yes, sir; yes, indeed, the best kind of

15

legislative history is that that is contemporaneous with the

16

law.

17

his brief regarding "deep pocket," I don't believe that that

18

theory is applicable to to the instant case for the following

19

reasons.

20

well set up kind of case for juries in that juries are limited

21

to amounts owing, which generally take the form of back pay,

22

and liquidated damages becomes the measure of that pecuniary

23

loss.

24

respect to the 3rd, the 4th, and the 5th Circuits, is that

25

there is no right to compensatory or punitive damages.

With respect to the petitioner's argument presented in

In fact, an age case is the kind of case that is a

The trend of the case law at this time, at least with

37

And in

1

fact, at page 14 of the conference report, it states that the

2

ADEA as amended by this Act does not provide remedies of a

3

punitive nature, and that the liquidated damages become a

4

substitute to compensate for compensatory damages that are too

5

obscure to define in any other way.

6

Court unhesitatingly applied the right of a jury trial in

7

1978 to state employers, or to other public employers, unhesi­

8

tatingly where the theory of the "deep pocket" would have as

9

much applicability as it would in the instant case.

10

Now, on this —

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. BARRY:

Your Honor, in that one —
Or was it

side?
MS. BARRY:

20

Don't those cases involve the surrender

of sovereign immunity by the states?

13

I might add that this

I believe it was imposed upon them from
when

Congress

With respect to the argument that Rule 38(a) --.with

21

respect to whether or not there was the statutory grant of

22

the right to a jury trial, I believe that what the petitioner

23

is arguing is that in order for 38(a) to apply in the'instant

24

case there has to be an express grant of jury trial.

25

I believe that that is based, as I understand the petitioner's
38

Again,

1

brief, on a presumption that there is no right to a jury

2

trial and that again is confused with the doctrine of sove­

3

reign immunity, which again, I'd like to emphasize, drops out

4

of the picture once the Government has consented to be sued.

5

And then, as the court of appeals held, and as the 3rd Circuit

6

held in the Collins case, as it was held in the Monolith case,

7

the statutory principles, or rather the principles of statu­

8

tory construction become applicable and the doctrine of

9

sovereign immunity is no longer of any concern...
And again, I'd like to emphasize that I believe

10

11

that that was the instruction set out by this Court in Law,

12

Pfitsch, Wickwire, and Galloway.
In conclusion, Your Honors, I'd like to state that

13
14

based upon the language of the Act, as the court of appeals

15

found by analyzing Section 15, there is an implied right of

16

jury trial.

17

cases dealing with the Federal Torts Claims Act, dealing with

18

actions to quiet title to real estate in which the Government

19

is a party, Congress knows how to deny a jury trial, and

20

expressly chose not to take such a deliberate act in the case

21

of the ADEA.

22

And certainly, as has been indicated in prior

4

Yes,

Congress has done it both ways in dif­

ferent settings, have they not?
MS. BARRY:

7

That’s correct, Your Honor.

They have

8

allowed an express grant of jury trial as the petitioner con­

9

ceded for tax refund suits.

But again, Your Honor, as I re­

10

call the history of that particular statute, it was already a

11

matter of case law under revised statutory —

12

QUESTION:

Wasn’t that the reason assigned, at any

rate, even though it was concededly artificial or antiquated?
MR. BARRY:

Well, Your Honor, I believe with

in passing in dicta, that I believe that this Court found in
40

1

Wickwire that it really came from a fair implication from the

2

statutory language, that is, it was an action at law.

3

fact it was noted that the petitioner in that case -- oh, I’m

4

sorry, the respondent, which was the Government, indicated

5

that, you know, the Seventh Amendment applied, and this Court

6

chastised the Government for making such an argument and,

7

said, no, it came from the implication of the statutory

8

language and that it was an action at law.

9

And in

Thus, I would say, Your Honors, that the conclusion

10

of the district court is well grounded in precedent, when it

11

held that there is an implied right to ajury trial by the .fact

12

that Congress vested exclusive jurisdiction in the district

13

courts and by the fact that it used the identical language

14

found in Section 7(c) when it developed Section 15(c) and

15

used the term "legal relief."
Now, as Theodore Roosevelt said, he asked the ques­

16
17

tion, who is the Government?

The Government is all of us in

18

this room.

19

of Justice Sneed concurring in Franquez v. United States,

20

he states, "I am unwilling to assume that jury trials will

21

not adequately protect the interests of the United States, for

22

it is after all only placing the interest of ourselves in the

23

hands of ourselves."

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF 'THE' PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just one quick point.

I'd just*like

12

to emphasize that in 1978 when Congress affirmatively granted

13

the right to trial by jury in suits under Section 7(c),

14

and did not do so under Section 15(c), it also enacted the

15

new subsection (f) which says, "Any personnel action of a

16

federal department shall not be subject to or affected by any

17

provision of this Act," at Section 12, dealing with the upper

18

age limitation.

19

Given this reminder, and codified expression of

20

congressional intent in the statute, that Section 15 is dis­

21

tinct from Section 7, we submit that Congress could not have

22

been under the impression that the same rule would be applied.

23

QUESTION:

Well, now, Mrs. Barry says that this

24

argument, the logic of this argument would mean that none of

25

the other provisions of the Act are applicable at all.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh, that's true, but we're not sug­

15

gesting that the new subsection accomplished anything that

16

wasn't in the statute before.

17

was implicit in the structure of the statute, because

18

section (f) contained separate substantive provisions.

no need to refer back to the other provisions that contain

separate remedial and enforcement provisions, and separate —
