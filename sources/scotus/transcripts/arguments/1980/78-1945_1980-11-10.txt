Mr. Mann, I think you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. MANN, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. MANN:

7

8

We'll hear arguments in

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue before the Court in this case is whether

9

10

under the Davis-Bacon Act a federal court would have jurisdic­

11

tion to revise a public contract upon suit by a private party

12

against a private contractor without regard to the actions or

13

inactions of the agency party to the contract.

14

The case arises at the Fermi National Accelerator Lat

15

near Batavia, Illinois, which Is a high energy physics research

16

establishment

17

tor.

18

has entered into a contract with the Federal Government, origi­

world's

largest

proton accelera­

The petitioner is an association of universities which

nally through the Atomic Energy Commission, and more recently
with the Department of Energy, to manage the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory.
All funds for the construction and management of the
Laboratory are supplied by the Federal Government through pro­
visions in the contract.

The petitioner's role is that of

manager, to supervise construction, to supervise the operation,
3

1

2

and to supervise the maintenance of the facility.
To carry out its responsibilities, the petitioner

3

association is authorized by the Government to hire individuals

4

to work in various categories, such as physicist, engineer,

5

technician,

6

compensation of those persons are provided by the Federal

7

Government in accordance with the contract.

8

schedules attached to the contract which have been agreed to

9

by the Government as appropriate for payment of the individuals

10
1 1

clerical person, et cetera, and all funds for the

There are rate

employed by the petitioner.
The claimant in this case maintains that notwith­

12

standing his employment as an electronics technician, that is,

13

one assigned to monitor computers, operate accelerators, and

14

assist in research functions, he should have been paid at area

15

electrician construction rates pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act.

16

The contract specifically provides that the parties did not

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

contemplate performance of construction work by persons em­
ployed by the Association, and therefore there are no DavisBacon Act stipulations in the contract.
Court issued two rulings.

The Federal District

The first ruling held that in the

absence of an express Davis-Bacon Act provision in the contract
there could be no right of recovery.

The case was left open

for purposes of allowing the plaintiff to show if he could
that the Government had made separate determinations regarding
his work as being construction in nature.

25

4

After the taking of

1

a number of depositions, other discovery, Freedom of Informa­

2

tion Act requests, the plaintiff was forced to conclude that

3

he could show no prior agency determination that his work was

4

in fact covered by the Davis-Bacon Act.

5

Consequently, the Federal District Court granted a

6

motion for summary judgment upon that result.

7

Appeals reversed.

8

regardless of the express inclusion of Davis-Bacon Act provi­

9

sions in this contract, they were included as a matter of law

The Court of

The Court of Appeals, in effect, held that

10

and that the Federal District Court would have authority in

1 1

effect to substitute its judgment for that of the agency

12

regarding the construction nature of the plaintiff's work,

13

to set an appropriate wage scale, and to set up an appropriate

14

classification.

15

In doing so it extrapolated from its 1977 McDaniel

16

case in which it held that there was an implied right of actior.

17

to enforce express contract terms setting forth Davis-Bacon Act

18

requirements.

19

20

21
22
23
24

25

We would ask the Court to focus on the fact that this
is not a proceeding arising under the Administrative Procedure
Act challenging agency action.

It is not a proceeding arising

under a contract action based upon express contract commitments.
Our petitioner here has never entered into a contract agreeing
to pay Davis-Bacon Act rates.

It is not an action to enforce

a self-enforcing statute, such as an equal opportunity clause,
5

1

which is directed to the beneficiary party without regard to

2

Government actions.

3

This is an action which attempts to maintain a pri­

4

vate cause of action to secure a judicial determination as to

5

coverage of the Davis-Bacon Act, application of particular

6

wages and classifications.

7

federal courts for the agencies’ contracting officers regard­

8

ing these matters of coverage, classification, and rates.

9

The effect is to substitute the

Not only that, the action is brought against a not-

10

for-profit entity which does not stand to gain or lose,

11

depending on what rates are paid to the employees.

12

brought after the contract has already been performed.

13

not being brought in anticipation of the contract, as some

14

recent cases have been brought, but after the contract was.

IS

performed the Federal District Court was asked to revise the

16

contract to include specific Davis-Bacon Act provisions and

17

to hold the defendant not-for-profit contractor liable without

18

regard to the agency action that it had contracted with.

19

And it is
It is

As the Court undoubtedly knows, the Davis-Bacon Act

20

emerged along with other pieces of legislation in the same

21

legislative era of the '30s, including the Fair Labor Standards

22

Act, the Walsh-Healey Act, and of course the Davis-Bacon Act

23
24

25

and other provisions requiring the payment of wages at certain
levels in order to rectify conditions that had resulted from
the Depression.
6

There are significant differences, however, between

1

2

the Davis Bacon-Act and the -Walsh-Healey Act, on the one hand,

3

and the Fair Labor Standards Act on the other.

4

Congress that enacted these statutes provided that the Davis-

5

Bacon Act and Walsh-Healey Act policies would be enforced

6
7

8

through the vehicle of contract, and not only through the vehi­
cle of contract but through the vehicle of administrative pre­
determination of what the obligations would be.
Conversely, in the Fair Labor Standards Act the uni­

9

10
1 1

12

13

The same

versal minimum wage and hours of work standard was set and the
parties affected by that were expressly given the right to
file suit to enforce their rights independently of the Govern­
ment to secure their wages.
Congress was concerned about the social goal that

14

it had, that is, to make sure that local wage and labor markets
15

were not disrupted, but also was concerned about maintaining
16

efficiency in government contracting.

And so it struck a

17

balance.

It struck a balance in the Davis-Bacon Act, and the

18

fulcrum of that balance is the concept of predetermination, so
19

that before the contract is gone

into and executed, all par­

20

ties know what their obligations are and no one can be heard
21

to complain if the obligations prove too onerous.
22

What we have here is an attempt by the Court of
23

Appeals and the respondents to upset that fulcrum, to establish
24

a principle whereby the federal courts after the contract has
25

7

1

been executed, notwithstanding the predetermination concept,

2

are in a position to go back and determine that something

3

should have been paid at a different rate than it was.

4

concept of predetermination, which is embedded in the Davis-

5

Bacon Act, was a topic of the legislative amendments to that

6

Act in 1935.

7

determination .

8
9

The

Prior to 1935 there was no provision for pre­

In 1935, after a four-year history of some confusion
in applying the law, Congress expressly amended it to provide

10

for predetermination, so that the contract would carry the

11

obligations and not some implied obligations based upon a

12

post-analysis of the work.

Mann, could I just be sure I under­

would he have in your view of the

law, have a private cause of action against your client for
the difference between what he was paid and what he actually
should have been paid?
MR. MANN:

We have taken the position on that ques­

tion, Mr. Justice Stevens, that there is under the Act no

8

1

private right of action at all, even to recover under express

2

provisions.

3

under a state common law theory of third-party beneficiary, but

4

not in federal court, because there's no real federal question

5

there;

6

the position that even if there were ah express/contract that

there would.not be a private right to go to court.

it's a contract question . involved' there.

9

There may be a right of action in a state court,

So we've taker,

QUESTION:

Did you take that position in the 7th

MR. MANN:

The position of the 7th Circuit -- that

Circuit ?

10

1 1

question was not asked in the 7th Circuit, and that issue was

12

not actually before us.
QUESTION:

But you didn't raise that in the 7th

15

MR. MANN:

That's correct.

16

QUESTION:

Or in the trial court?

17

MR. MANN:

In the trial court the question of the

13
14

Circuit ?

18

private right of action per se was raised in the context of the

19

jurisdiction of the court to revise the contract.

That is, we

20

didn't really address the issue whether in general there is a

21

private right to enforce a specific clause, but whether there

22
23
24

25

is a private right to obtain the court determination of the
fundamental issues of coverage, of classification

of rate,

that was the issue presented to the trial court, and the trial
court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the

9

1

Davis-Bacon Act to in effect substitute its judgment for the

2

contracting officer's judgment, at least without having had

3

some effort by the contracting officer to be involved, some

4

appeal to him, some --

5

QUESTION:

Well, I understand the distinction betweer.

6

predetermination and postdetermination, but it seems to me

7

that's quite a different question than the question whether

8

there is a private cause of action.

9

your brief the issue was rather clear, that you basically were

And it seemed to me in

10

arguing about whether they decided in advance of performance

11

of the contract there was any Davis-Bacon Act work and you

12

said, no, and that's the end of the case. . That doesn't re­

13

quire us to think at a.11 about private cause of action-,, as I

14

see it.
MR. MANN:

15

Well, I believe the private cause of

16

action comes in, Your Honor, in connection with the question

17

of whether or not there is a private cause of action in the

18

context of this case, to in effect secure a coverage determina-'

19

tion by the federal court as opposed to the contracting

20

agency.

21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

But would you say the contracting agency

could, after the contract was performed, come in and say, we'd
like to make a new, a postcontract coverage determination?
MR. MANN:

I believe that the evolved law under the

Davis-Bacon Act would hold that if the agency wishes to come
10

1

in and amend the contract, the agency may find itself liable

2

for increased cost, as an amendment for the convenience of the

3

Government, for example.

4

General decisions and perhaps some Court of Claims decisions

5

which say that the Government does not have as a matter of

6

right the right to come in and amend its determination, and

7

yet still hold the contractor unequivocally liable as though

8

the amendment had occurred at the outset.

I believe there have been Comptroller'

But I believe that the concept of predetermination is

9

10

flexible enough to permit the agency itself, upon its own

11

motion or upon the appeal of some party to --.
QUESTION

12

13

Well, if they assume the responsibility

for paying the difference, I suppose anybody could do that.

14

MR. MANN

That's correct.

IS

QUESTION

But assuming they're saying, no.

And -We paid

16

you the contract amount and we just now realized we should have

17

made a Davis-Bacon Act determination.

18

They can't do that either, can they, in your view of the law?

We failed to do it.

19

MR. MANN

Our view of the law is that they cannot.

20

QUESTION

In other words, it seems to me that if

21

I understand your position correctly, it's the same whether the

22

Government were the plaintiff or the employee was the plain-

23
24

25

tiff?
MR. MANN

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION

So the private cause of action issue, it
11

1

seems to me, is a red herring in this case.

2

MR. MANN:

Well, except that the private cause of

3

action raises a question as to who is going to control the

4

terms of the contract.

5

contracting parties, that is, the Government, moves to amend

6

the contract for its advantage in one way or another.

7

I think it's one thing if one of the

But these are after all public contracts and there's

8

public policy as well as economics involved, and for a third

9

party to come in and say, irrespective of what the agency

10

thinks about how the law should be applied, I believe this was

1 1

Davis-Bacon work and I want an amendment; we believe that that

MR. MANN:

I would assume that.

QUESTION:

So the public policy in the private cause

of action issue is just a question of where he sues.
MR. MANN:

If there's an express term in the con­

tract, that's correct.
QUESTION:

I don't believe there is a --

And that was in the

McDaniel case by hypo

thesis, wasn't it?
MR. MANN:

By hypothesis; that's correct.

The 7th

Circuit in both McDaniel I and McDaniel II indicated in the

12

course of their opinion that they assumed that there were ex­

2

press provisions.
QUESTION:

In this case there never would have been

MR. MANN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The only lawsuit that has been brought

8

is by the private individual.

QUESTION:

Right.

13

If

.the

answer

to

that

is,

14

no,

there's no private cause of action at least in the

15

federal courts.

Then that's the end of this case, without

getting into matter addressed in Part I of your brief.
17

18
19

20

MR. MANN:

express terms, clearly there is no federal jurisdiction to
create the terms that are being enforced.
QUESTION:

25

If there's no private right of action in

federal district court, that's the end of that case.

23
24

Our position is that

whether or not there's a private right of action to enforce

21
22

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. MANN:

MRS.

Mr.

SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

This is a suit against a federal contractor based

8

solely on the Davis-Bacon Act.

9

agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It's not a suit to review
An

10

Administrative Procedure Act suit would raise different issues

1 1

between different parties and require the consideration of

12

different fundamental legislative policies.
I want to emphasize that neither my brief nor my

13
14

remarks today deal with the issues or the policies that would

IS

have to be considered in an Administrative Procedure Act suit.

16

We've taken no position on those issues and I'm not authorized

17

to speak for the government concerning them.
The question here is only whether the contractor

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

employee has a right to relief against the contractor in an
implied private cause of action under the Davis-Bacon Act
itself.
We have discussed in our brief the reason why we
believe that under the Cort v. Ash test there is no such
implied cause of action.

And we have emphasized there the

indications of legislative intent as the recent decisions of

14

1

2

this Court require.
This morning, however, I would like to focus on the

3

third Cort v. Ash factor, and discuss briefly why we believe

4

that the implication of a private cause of action is not neces­

sary to the accomplishment of the legislative purpose.

Energy as well as at NASA and the Defense Department.
These two types of contracts are in many ways quite
different in terms both of the need of the laborers for the
additional protections that a private cause of action would
afford, and of the potential of such a cause of action for dis­
rupting procurement.

These differences simply highlight the

importance of maintaining the balance Congress struck in an

earlier day.

rates, assume there was a slip-up and for some reason an

Mr. Mann has emphasized the difficulties that

25

19

1

implication of a private cause of action would cause for

2

Government procurement from the contractor's point of view.

3

There are also problems from the point of view of the agency

4

that is using these highly specialized, expert contractors

5

to achieve important federal goals.

6

The interface between construction, alteration, and

7

repair work covered by Davis-Bacon and installation, experi­

8

mental, or maintenance work that is not covered will often be

9

very hard to identify under prime contracts like the one here.
Moreover, the various work projects must be closely

10
1 1

coordinated and labor disputes avoided.

12

it is important that decisions concerning Davis-Bacon coverage

13

be made by people who are very familiar with the technical

program involved, and that those decisions be made promptly,

15

with finality, and consistently, for all work within the

scope of the contract.

If it is to be construed as being only an action on

area around the country, and that's all that he is supposed to

19

that a contract is a construction contract.

20

Now, what the petitioner seeks to say, that there:

Well, the Solicitor of Labor in his testimony in

21

1962, among others, has said that when Congress enacted the

22

Davis-Bacon Act in 1931 and amended it substantially in 1935,

23
24

25

Congress did not use the words "construction, alteration, or
repair, including painting and decorating," to mean something
special, or something that is placed in the hands of some
28

1

technicians at some government agency, or something difficult

2

of interpretation.

3

all of the authorities who have referred to it have talked

4

about the fact that Congress meant the ordinary meaning of

5

those words, and courts can make those determinations.

The Solicitor of Labor at that time and

We have cited the recent Cortelyou of one of our

6
7

circuits in which the Court held specifically, very recently,

8

that the work that was before it clearly was pursuant to a

9

contract calling for "construction, alteration, or repair,

10

including painting or decorating."
Now, I have asserted in my brief that the right of

11

12

action question was never briefed, argued, or whatever, before

13

the lower courts.

14

petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment, and discovery

15

at that time, by the way, was stayed to permit the court to

16

rule on that legal question.
That summary judgment motion was supported by an

17

18
19

20

21

This summary judgment matter arose when the

affidavit of petitioner’s counsel saying, "No Davis-Bacon Act
stipulations have been included within or are incorporated
within the government contract here in question."

And I submit to this Court also, that the Davis-

Bacon Act is expressly within our contract, notwithstanding

other things this is -- the fact that Davis-Bacon was referred

to in correspondence between the AEC at that time and our

petitioner.

15

construction work which is called for by this contract would

included in all those subcontracts.

The requirement on the petitioner is that such

And there was the further agreement between them by
memorandum which we were able to discover -- by the way,
through Freedom of Information Act procedures, not through the
discovery that we were able to get by that timey-- -there was
the further memorandum of understanding that if the petitioner
does any of this work with its own employees

-- that's our

is the jurisdictional prerequisite, the right of action is

to determine the question of the existence of a right of

one under Section 3(b), talking about the right of action

against the contractor and his sureties, which Congress has

given to him.

I have not said that a wage earner has the right to

that the remedies are unavailable or ineffective in this case.

That was shown in the McDaniel case because that was in issue,

4

and we presented affidavits below in the trial court demon­

5

6

operating Argonne National Lab -- had not furnished the neces­

sary surety payment bond and that the Comptroller General had

not withheld certain payments in order to pay employees, as

case that the situation was the same, that our Petitioner has
not submitted Miller Act bonds or any other kind of surety pay­
ment bond that the employee can proceed upon, and that the
Comptroller General has not withheld sums to assure payment to
these laborers.
Certainly this Court, unless it makes that

25

35

1

presumption cannot rule appropriately on my opponent's -sugges­

2

tion that there is no right of action existing under circum­

3

stances such as these.

4

again -- I am not asserting that there's an alternate implied

5

right of action for use by employees under any and all circum­

6

stances as an alternative to going through the surety payment

7

bond procedure if the statute is interpreted in that way.

8

I am saying that if those remedies are rendered ineffective

9

and unavailable and particularly if they're rendered ineffec­

I am not -- and I make this clear

10

tive and unavailable because of action or inaction by the

1 1

contractor and maybe cooperation by the Government, that the

12

employee does have this right of action.

13

and the courts should make sure that --

14

QUESTION:

Congress intended it,

So, any time the agency issues a contract

15

and has made a determination that there is no coverage, that it

16

isn't covered, I suppose you would -- the contract would issue

17

and there wouldn't be a surety bond, and in any of those cir­

18

cumstances if you allege that the agency mistakenly decided

19

that there was no coverage, you would have -- you should be

20

able to have the court redetermine coverage.

MR. NYE:

Well, I know that Your Honor wants direct

answers so I'm going to give you one:

MR. NYE:

Yes.

yes, Your Honor.

Well, that's this case, isn't it?

That's true.

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

HR. NYE:

3

There is no coverage determination saying

that the Davis-Bacon Act does not apply in this case.

4

5

Oh.

QUESTION:

I know, but they didn't -- but they didn't

provide for it.
MR. NYE:

6

If the Court please, they referred to it,

7

they spoke about it, they did everything except put a long list

8

of stipulations in the contract.

the Government and my opponent have not referred to any

23
24

25

The Davis-Bacon Act requires that there

be certain stipulations; that's -QUESTION:

16

17

Well, that "long list of stipulations,"

And therefore its absence indicates that

the parties determined that the Davis-Bacon Act is inappli­
cable .
MR. NYE:

Well -- or the parties -- well, I know the

reason why they did not include that:

because they intended

that all Davis-Bacon work under this Davis-Bacon contract was
to be subcontracted, and that the subcontracts would include
those stipulations.
But here we are asserting -- and we are at the stage
where this must be accepted by the Court.
37

We are asserting on

1

behalf of these laborers that they did certain amounts of the

2

Davis-Bacon Act work.

3

QUESTION:

I see.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Nye, in this connection, earlier, I

5

understood you to say that the contract has a provision that

6

says if this eventuality comes to pass, then they shall be paid

7

at Davis-Bacon rates.

8

MR. NYE:

QUESTION:

10

11

That's what I contend, even -Do you rely on paragraph 33, is that the

paragraph you rely on for that, or is it a different paragraph1;

Two letters; excuse me:

one at the time of the

randum of understanding that I was able to discover when
Modification 14 was made by the parties.
Modification 14 was the big modification of this
contract, so at both times the Government and the petitioner
agreed between themselves that in the event that the contractor1
does any of this work with its own work force .-- and these
employees whom I represent are in its own work force -- that
the contract will be modified.

And I say it is modified

thereby to include the Davis-Bacon Act stipulations concerning
23
24

these employees.
QUESTION:

But don't you run into the same problem

25

38

1

Justice Stewart just identified, though, the very fact that

2

it was not subsequently modified tends to indicate that the

3

two parties agreed that no Davis-Bacon Act work had been per­

4

formed?

5

MR. NYE:

Well, if the Court please, even this

6

Davis-Bacon committee -- it's an informal committee; it's not

7

as formal as counsel would let us believe, and I was present

8

at the depositions where it was described.

10

office was presented with requests for Davis-Bacon Act deter­

13

work.

And 126 of those requests were returned by this Davis-

Now, I submit that certain of the Davis-Bacon Act

so, they are entitled to be paid.

And if

Congress intended it, and

nobody, not their decision -- not to call this a Davis-Bacon
Act contract -- not their decision, not -QUESTION:

But Mr. Nye, just sticking with that for

just a second, is it not true that if that happened the way
you describe, the Government had a duty not to pay the contract

price until they were satisfied that the employees had been

2

paid the appropriate wages, isn't that true?

MR. NYE:

Well, there's question as to how that's

out in full on the contract until it's satisfied that there's

been no violation of the Davis-Bacon Act?

Act is upon the employer to pay, and it's been referred to
again and again by Congress and by the courts as being -- and
by this Court — as being a statute that requires the payment
to laborers and mechanics concerning government contracts in­
volving construction, alteration and repair, including painting;
and decorating, of wages which the Secretary of Labor has
determined are the prevailing wages in a particular area for
that type of work.
40

1

By the way, the Government in its brief has also

2

said that if we look at the payment schedules -- some of which

3

the Petitioner has included in the Joint Appendix.

4

at payment schedules, the Government has said it is clear that

5

certain of the amounts received by my clients — actually

6

received -- were less than what the prevailing wages would have

7

required that they be paid.
So we have -- there is no question that these people

8
9

If we look

have not been paid what they are owed.

There is no question

10

that Congress commanded that the prevailing wage principle be

1 1

effectuated.
And by the way, I think it's important'to note the Comptrol

12

13

her General has just done a survey and there are. 77 statutes

14

concerning federally assisted contract situations, 77 statutes

15

in which the Davis-Bacon Act is referred to and in these 77

statutes it is required that Davis-Bacon obligations be per­

formed,

that payment of wages be made in accordance with the

prevailing wage principle of the Davis-Bacon Act and the DavisBacon Act is cited in each, of .those, statutes.
I don't know what effect if any this Court's deci­
sion will have on the 41 state "little Davis-Bacon acts" which
exist throughout the country.

I'm not representing that it

will have or not have any effect, but it shows the pervading
effect and acceptance of the prevailing wage principle, not
only by Congress in the Davis-Bacon Act, not only by Congress
41

1

in the 77 other statutes that refer to federally assisted

2

programs and construction, but also throughout the rest of

3

these United States.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

I take it that the heart of the Govern­

5

ment's submission is that the agency determination of coverage

6

is just unreviewable?

7

MR. NYE:

If the Court please, I suggest that the

8

agency has no function in deciding or not deciding with any

9

binding effect that a contract is covered or not.

10

11

QUESTION:

I know that, but don't you understand the

Government to assert what I say?

12

MR. NYE:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And that if the agency makes a determina­

14

tion before contracting and that is subject to appeal, I sup­

15

pose, to the Department of Labor, but the Department of Labor's

16

decision may or may not bind the agency.

17

Government's submission is that those determinations are not

subject to judicial review.

Do you have anything

further?
MR. MANN:

Just one, comment, Jr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. MANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. MANN:

I'd like to reemphasize that it is our

position that in order to hold the contractor liable, there
must be an affirmative predetermination of coverage, and the
coverage must be not only the wage rates but the existence of
the coverage of the Act as well, because the agency making that
determination is the other contracting party.

And that concept

22

is embodied in the comment that Mr. Nye referred to with
23

respect to the contract, which is shown on pages 62 and 63 of
24

the Appendix, where it indicates that if the Atomic Energy
25

43

1

Commission determines that work is covered by Davis-Bacon,

2

then the contract will be amended.

3

QUESTION:

May I just ask one other question in re­

4

sponse to something Mr. Nye had said?

5

are referred to in the Appendix -- and very honestly, I don't

6

have them in mind -- if they do unambiguously state that, if

7

employees of the contractor do perform any Davis-Bacon work,

8

then they shall be paid at Davis-Bacon rates, if they so pro­

9

vide, then do you have a duty to pay at the rate he claims?

10

MR. MANN:

If those letters that

If they provided that, yes, sir.

What

1 1

the provisions of the letter agreement say is that if the

12

Atomic Energy Commission determines both the need for our

13

employees to do the work and that the work is covered, then

14

the contract will be amended.

QUESTION:

with their own employees if we agree that this is covered work:

If we agree -- it's
