ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY A. HAUSER, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. HAUSER:

7

8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Henry Hauser and I'm an Assistant State's

9

10

Attorney, and I represent the petitioners in this certiorari

1 1

petition.

12

Certiorari was granted to the 7th Circuit last March.

13

This is a 1983 tax injunction case that was filed in the

14

federal court and it deals with 1977 local real estate taxes

15

which are assessed and contended to be unconstitutionally

16

assessed on the taxpayer in the case at bar.

The response of the county tax officials

and that's

Mr. Edward J. Rosewell, who is one of the petitioners.
the County Collector.

He is

He has duties under the Illinois stat­

utes to collect real estate taxes which were assessed for 1977
against the property owned by the taxpayer in this case.
Mr. Tully is no longer the County Assessor; he's been replaced
by Mr. Thomas Hynes.
The response that the petitioners filed for this
1983 action was a motion to dismiss, which was premised among
3

1

other things on the federal anti-tax injunction statute.

2

The motion to dismiss which is set out at Appendix, page 11,

3

also sets out grounds that there was not a claim stated, and

4

that there was available to the taxpayer, again, a plain,

5

speedy, and efficient remedy in the state courts, and also a

6

remedy available pursuant to the state statutory tax system.

7

Secondly, it was contended in that motion that the

8

state taxpayer had available to her in this case a 1983 action

9

in which she could have raised all of the claims which she de­

10

sired to raise in the federal court injunctive action.
QUESTION:

A 1983 action in the state court, are you

referring to, now?
MR. HAUSER:

Yes.

Our contention is, Your Honor,

that the taxpayer had available to her a remedy under 1983
which could have been filed in the state court under the
Illinois case .of Alberty v. Daniel.
QUESTION:

Any other remedies besides 1983 in the

state court?
MR. HAUSER:

She certainly did.

She had — one of

the facts which needs to be made clear in this case is that
the taxpayer alleges in her complaint that she had the funds
to pay the tax in this case.

Therefore, because the taxpayer

had the funds available to her to pay the tax in this case and
sue for a refund, there is no threatened loss of the property
and there is also available to her the possibility of filing

25

4

1

a specific objection in the Collector's annual application for

2

the sale of delinquent tax property.

3

available to her the statutory Illinois proceeding.

4

QUESTION:

So that she clearly had

Well, her response to that in part is

5

that since the State pays no interest on the tax while the

6

refund's being litigated, that that's not an efficient remedy.

7

What do you have to say about that?
MR. HAUSER:

8
9

Well, our response is that the taxpayer

would have a right to file a 1983 action in a state court

10

raising that precise claim.

So that even if that claim was

1 1

not available, and the difficulty with part of this issue is

12

that the Illinois Supreme Court has not had a chance -- in

13

fact, it's not been given a chance -- to rule on the 1983

14

portion of a claim to interest.
The predicate of the taxpayer's argument in this case

15
16

is basically the Illinois Supreme Court's holding in

17

Clarendon Associates v. Korzen, and Lakefront Realty v.

18

Lorenz.
QUESTION:

20

calendar these days?
MR. HAUSER:

21
22
23
24

25

How far behind is your Cook County civil

behind right now.

It's -- well, we're about five years

The difficulty -- I need to make it clear

that the specific objections are treated separately from
the entire civil calendar in the Circuit Court of Cook
County.
5

1

2

QUESTION:

You would call five years' delay a speedy

remedy?
MR. HAUSER:

3

Well, it's speedy in the sense that

4

if the taxpayer — it's available to the taxpayer, and the

5

taxpayer has a damage remedy that

6

can pay has a damage remedy available to her.

7

I think the ruling of the district court was based on Tully v.

8

Griffin.

at least a taxpayer who
And if the --

9

The question in the anti-tax injunction statute is

10

whether there would be a federal right which would otherwise

1 1

be lost?

12

So the question comes down to, and it's a question that's not

13

been resolved in Illinois, and the question is-- and it's,

14

I don't think, presented in this case -- whether there is a

15

constitutional right to interest.

16

been pled, the taxpayer has not asserted, we suggest, a

17

constitutional right to interest, but it's --

18
19

20

21

22

And there Is no right under Illinois law to interest.

QUESTION:

Now, the way this case has

Mr. Hauser, isn't it possible that

there's no constitutional right to interest, but that never­
theless, the denial of interest when you have to wait four or
five years to get your money back, would prevent the remedy
from being speedy, adequate, and effieient, or whatever the
statutory: language is?

23
24

MR. HAUSER:

Well I:i think that in that aspect one

has to balance the threatened harm from a federal tax
25

6

1

injunction against the delay or the harm that's caused to the

2

taxpayer.

3

case, as she did, a federal damage remedy, or --

Now if the taxpayer has available to her in this

4

QUESTION:

5

will that give her?

6

She only gets interest if she has a constitutional right to

7

the interest.
MR. HAUSER:

8
9

10

What is the federal damage remedy?

What

Doesn't that raise the same question?

Well, she would have to show that,

judge.
QUESTION:

I don't think that responds to my ques­

11

tion that one might assume there's no federal constitutional

12

right to interest, and nevertheless feel that a remedy which

13

denies interest on withheld money for a five-year period is

14

not an adequate remedy, within the meaning of the statute.

15

MR. HAUSER:

Well, again we argue the policy that

16

under Tully v. Griffin, as long as long as the taxpayer

17

suffers no irreparable injury, that whatever one might want to

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

say qualitatively -QUESTION:

Well, it's surely irreparable if you

lose the use of the money for five years.
to get it back.

That's irreparable.

You're never going

Maybe it isn't serious

enough to trouble you but it is irreparable.
MR. HAUSER:

No, Your Honor.

It can be a serious

matter, and it certainly can support a damage claim.
QUESTION:

Well, but it only supports a damage claim
7

1

2

if there's a constitutional right to interest.
MR. HAUSER:

Well, then, what's the -- I question

3

the . policy

4

is some reason why there should be, why that must lay?

5

behind the other side of the argument that there

QUESTION:

Well, the reason would be that an adequate

6

remedy ought to make the litigant who's been harmed whole.

7

That would be the reasoning, I suppose.

8
9

10

MR. HAUSER:

Well, the damage remedy certainly does

that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, five years at 15 percent a year,

11

or even ten, to make it easier to compute, at least for me,

12

that doesn't make them very whole, does it?

13

MR. HAUSER:

Well, let me refocus that.

If the

14

taxpayer can demonstrate an unconstitutional overassessment

15

and if in fact the interest is a measure of damages, then the

16

taxpayer will have a right to interest, and a taxpayer is

17

therefore made whole.

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but these are all "ifs."

You don't

concede on behalf of the County, do you, that she's entitled
to interest?
MR. HAUSER:

No, we don't, Your Honor.

We do not --

the difficulty -QUESTION:

You just say she's got a right to file

another lawsuit and see if she can get it?
MR. HAUSER:

Right.

That's exactly right.
8

1

In the argument that lawsuit has indeed already been filed

2

and that cause of action basically acknowledged by the 7th

3

Circuit.

4

federal tax injunction where the taxpayer has available to her

5

a federal damage remedy.
QUESTION:

6
7

10

I need to make one thing clear --

But only predicated on a constitutional

violation?
MR. HAUSER:

8
9

So we have a disappearance here of -- you have a

else?

Well, that's so; that's so.

But why

In other words, the policy is, the real question is the

policy behind the federal injunction for state taxes.

1 1

QUESTION:

12

MR. HAUSER:

Right.
And we respectfully submit that the

13

risk -- the complaint alleges, and I need to clarify this, the

14

complaint alleges a two-year delay, not a five-year delay.

15

When I responded to one of the Justices' questions, the very

16

last year that's still open in Cook County is five years old,

17

but the average delay which is alleged under this rememdy is

18

two years, and that's admitted for the purpose of the motion to

19

dismiss.

20
21

22
23
24

25

This doesn't take into account the fact that the
taxpayer has 90 days within the filing of a specific objection
to arrange a pre-trial settlement discussion with the lawyers
for the County.
QUESTION:

What's the calendar like in the federal

court for Cook County?
9

1

MR. HAUSER:

The calendar of the federal court?

2

It's probably as crowded as any federal district court in the

3

nation.

4

QUESTION:

5

as the state court?

Well, is it slower than -- is it as slow

MR. HAUSER:

6

Well, we don't have any federal tax

13

What's the civil calendar generally?

MR. HAUSER:

10

This is

It's probably pretty long, isn't it?
Well, it's probably -- the question is

whether that, whether the federal remedy is any speedier than
the state, if we're talking about damage remedies.

The ques­

tion is, what has the taxpayer lost if she gets all of the
interest back?

In other words, if the delay deprives the

taxpayer of the use -QUESTION:

Mr. Hauser, you keep saying, if she gets

Isn't that correct?

2

MR. HAUSER:

3

QUESTION:

Except that her position is that she -I know what her position is, but your

4

position is that she's not entitled to interest.

correct ?

Isn't that

Constitution?
MR. HAUSER:
QUESTION:

that also.

You say she's not entitled to

1 1

interest, so how can you rely on the fact that she might win

12

her lawsuit as the reason why she should lose her lawsuit?

13

MR. HAUSER:

Well, if she can demonstrate the right

14

to the interest, she ought not -- unless she can demonstrate

15

the right to interest --

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION:

Yes, I know, but you don't concede she

has any right to interest.
MR. HAUSER:

I couldn't, Your Honor, because we op­

pose that position, and I -- but I say this, that unless the
taxpayer can demonstrate a right to interest and demonstrate -or, let's say, interest may be the wrong word.

Perhaps the

taxpayer must demonstrate a right to the recompense or the
damages for the loss of the use value of the money that's tied
up during the tax proceedings.

Now, that's the -- that's

argued in the taxpayer's brief.
11

1

QUESTION:

Well, then she wouldn't -- you can turn

2

that argument on its head too, and say that if she can't

3

demonstrate that she has a right to what she's claiming, she's

4

not entitled to the injunction that she's claiming, not be­

5

cause of the anti-injunction statute, but because of a short­

6

coming in her pleadings.

7

MR. HAUSER:

We argue that too, Your Honor.

We

8

argue that the allegations that are made in the complaint are

9

not sufficient to demonstrate a violation of her Fourteenth

10
1 1

Amendment rights.

Now --

QUESTION:.

Isn't the real question, how soon should

12

she get a hearing?

13

arguing the merits of her case but isn't the question whether

14

she should be able to get an earlier hearing in a federal court

15

than she could in the state?

16
17

18
19

20
21
22
23
24

25

And you're arguing -- you certainly are

MR. HAUSER:

Well, the question is whether she's

entitled to an injunction in a federal court.
QUESTION:
MR. HAUSER:

Yes.
And the question in the federal court is

whether -- not only whether there's a plain, speedy, and effi­
cient remedy in the state court, but also, whether there's a
remedy in the federal court.

Now, she must of course be able

to demonstrate that right, because, if in other words you -QUESTION:

Well, is it true that in her administra­

tive remedy, is the remedy provided by the Illinois tax
12

1

statutes and refund statutes, there is no interest allowable

2

in those, is there?

3

MR. HAUSER:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HAUSER:

6
7

8
9

Not -- the way -Is that right or not?
As

a

matter of Illinois statutory

construction, that's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

All right.

So you rely on the availabil­

ity of an adequate remedy in the state courts on 1983?
MR. HAUSER:

Or the availability in federal court

10

of a similar damage remedy which is the predicate for our

1 1

state argument.

12

question is, and I think I need to at the outset distinguish

13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

The point that's raised is that if -- the

between the limitation that's contained in 1341, which is a
limitation on injunctions. It creates no jurisdiction.

1341 is

a limitation on the exercise of federal injunctive power, but
it is a limitation which was necessitated initially by the
abuse of diversity jurisdiction, where taxpayers from outside
of states would tie up state taxes, like has happened in
Illinois, and has happened in this case, effectively, where the
taxes have been tied up now for nearly two years without even
the matter being decided.
But there's a further view when

you

have a 1983

action being made, being stated, because that's different
23

from a diversity case.

In other words, the focus in a 1341

24

action where diversity is involved is solely upon the state
25

13

1

remedies, because the federal court had no right to make

2

federal remedies for the state courts under diversity juris­

3

diction .

4

But under 1341, and under the Civil Rights Act,

5

where you have a jurisdictional predicate based on federal

6

statute, then the question has to go back really to the

7

historical precedent.

8

and Great Lakes Dredge S Dock v. Huffman.

9

is a situation where that question is met.

Cases

like

Matthews

v.

Rodgers.,

And Tully v. Griffir.
Ahd the articulation

10

of the equity rule is that a federal court is under an equi­

11

table duty to refrain from interfering with a state's collec­

12

tion of its revenue except in cases where an assertive federal

13

right might otherwise be lost.

I suggest that --

MR. HAUSER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And the Court of Appeals for the 7th

MR. HAUSER:

That's right.

QUESTION:

2

I'm looking at page 2a of the certiorari

petition.

3

MR. HAUSER:

One of those has split, and the

One of those questions is the one to

How'd that happen?

That's correct, Your Honor.

Well, it's not -- we suggest that it is,
We granted certiorari to consider a single

question and the Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said they
had a single, and to use their word, s-o-l-e, sole question.
Isn't that correct?

20

MR. HAUSER:

Well, that's correct, Your Honor,

21

although I suggest that if the decision of the 7th Circuit is
22

incorrect,

then if the decision of Judge Bua in the district

23

court was correct but for the wrong reasons, then it simply
24

makes sense to reach that issue as a matter of judicial

15

1

economy.

2

out in my brief that we were raising a question that arguably

3

might not be available below, and we did argue in our brief

4

that we perceived the question to be subsumed within that

5

question.

6

Now, I pointed out, and I did argue and I did set

So —
QUESTION:

Then the only question presented in the

7

certiorari petition and the only question that the Court of

Appeals undertook to decide was whether or not there was a

that correct?

12

different question from the one embraced in your certiorari

petition on which we granted.

14

MR. HAUSER:

It is a different question, although I

15

think that if there is federal jurisdiction lacking, again,

16

the district court ruled in the favor of the County, on grant­

17

ing the motion to dismiss, and it doesn't seem to make a lot

of sense to allow a judge to be reversed,

I think that might be more the failure

to articulate the reasons for a decision and it might be more
appropriate to encourage district courts to articulate the
reasons for their opinions.

Don't you really — just like in this

reached before decisions on whether the complaint stated a

MR. HAUSER:

Unless the taxpayer can demonstrate an asserted

That's correct.

MR. HAUSER:

That it may.
Now, if there's no requirement that -- you
19

don't know whether it will or won't, does that bear on the

2

plaintiff's speedy and efficient remedy?

3

MR. HAUSER:

Yes.

Well, Hillsborough v. Cromwell

4

says that if the remedy in the state court is uncertain, then

5

1341 is avoided.

6

Hillsborough were a situation where the uncertainty was not the

7

result of a failure of any taxpayers to file the suit.

8

9

a new remedy under 1983 unless some taxpayers file it.

But our argument is that the facts in

10

there's never been a 1983 tax case filed in the state court,

25

If it's uncertain whether it's available in the state

court, then why can't the taxpayer seek an injunction in
federal court with a 1983 suit?
MR. HAUSER:

The question is, there's a failure, I

think, to distinguish between injunctive relief as against
damage relief.

Now, Alberty was a damage case, and there's

a federal case -- Fulton Market, the 7th Circuit; Fulton

that once Martinez is decided the way it is and once Maine
v. Thiboutat is decided the way it is, that's a problem that's
created.

And I don't think it's a problem because if you look

at the final, in the final analysis, the taxpayer indeed has a
choice.

The taxpayer, who is not threatened with irreparable

injury, has a choice of filing either in the state court or
in the federal court to recoup the damages which are monetary
damages threatened by those parts of the Illinois remedy to
which she objects.
23

1

QUESTION:

But if the remedy you're relying on to

2

get you out from under 1341 is a damage suit in federal court,

3

it simply doesn't come within the language of 1341.

4

MR. HAUSER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the

5

reason why that's so is because initially 1341 was directed

6

to diversity actions.
QUESTION:

7

Well, however it may be, you can't invoke

8

1341 by saying that she has an adequate damage remedy in

9

federal court.

10
1 1

Because it doesn't come in under the terms of

1341.
MR. HAUSER:

But we do argue that in Tully v.

12

Griffin,, a 1341 case that under the broader view of equity law,

13

that a federal court is under an equitable duty to refrain from

14

interfering with a state's collection of its revenue, except

15

in cases where a federal right may otherwise be lost, and the

16

view is not restricted solely to the state remedy, but to the

19

20
21

22

24

25

federal remedy too.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hauser, I think my brother Rehnquist's

point is that the plain language of 1341 says that a federal
court does not have the power to enjoin the collection of
state taxes where there is a speedy, a plain, speedy, and
efficient remedy in the state courts, in the state courts.
MR. HAUSER:

That's right.

My response to that is,

Your Honor, that unless you distinguish between 1341 and the
traditional limitations put on any federal district court in
24

1

dispensing injunctions, you will end up with a plain, speedy,

2

and efficient federal damage remedy, as we have in this case,

3

that will -QUESTION:

4

5

Well, there might be reasons not to issue

an injunction in various cases, depending upon --

QUESTION:

Yes.
In any particular case, depending upon the

8

generally applicable maximus of equity with respect to irre­

9

parable damage and no adequate remedy at law and the rest of it

10

But the question in this case is whether or not such an in­

1 1

junction is barred by 1341, and that's the only question, isn't

12

it?
MR. HAUSER:

13

As you start creating more federal rights,

by expanding that jurisdiction, it's necessary to view the

of employment claims.

there's a disagreement with that, then that changes the avail­

Clarendon decision, and in a host of other decisions in
Illinois.
27

1

2

The Illinois court has unequivocally determined that
the nonpayment of interest does not render a remedy inadequate.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. FOX:

Do you equate inadequate with inefficient?
Yes, sir.

"Inadequate"

QUESTION:

Well, there are a great many claims

against the United States in which no interest is allowed.

13

Not in this context, but would you say that that's not an

14

adequate remedy that might lay a foundation for some other

15

type of relief such as equitable relief?

16

MR. FOX:

Sir, in the context of the United States,

17

first of all, we do have the question of the sovereign.

18

And interest allowable against the sovereign is by statute, as

19

witness the Internal Revenue Code.

That question

I refer, for instance,

to Judge Haynsworth's remarks in the Livingston case which we
have cited in our brief wherein he said South Carolina may
elect to pay interest or not.

It is a sovereign and it doesn't
28

have to award interest on tax refunds.

it then opens its door to federal jurisdiction by not provid­

3

ing a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.

iIn the 7th Circuit we had the same thing in Olin
Mathieson.
QUESTION:

6

Well, there's a certain circularity to

7

that, though, counsel, isn't there?

Because if it opens the

8

doors to federal courts but is not required to pay interest,

9

all you get is the same relief in federal court as you would

10

have gotten in state court, that is, your refund without

1 1

interest.
MR. FOX:

12

No, sir, because we do not sue for a re­

13

fund -- 1341 is directed only to injunctive relief and this

14

case stands on .that particular proposition which we have allegec.

This matter, by the way, came on below on

3

QUESTION:

We are not litigating that

But then, why should it be of any import­

4

ance in the administration of the anti-injunction statute that

5

a state doesn't allow interest, if you have no constitutional

6

right to it?
MR. FOX:

7

Because, I believe that to take a man's

8

money today — to paraphrase Judge Learned Hand about 50 years

9

ago in the Procter S Gamble case, to take a man's money today

10

as a condition of his going into court and being able to sue

1 1

for a refund and then two or more years later giving back that

12

same money, is giving back less than the state took.
QUESTION:

13

So, even though it is not a constitu­

14

tional violation, it brings into play, it relieves you from

15

the bar of 1341?
MR. FOX:

16

Yes, sir.

Now, it would be a second story

17

if we were to go into the condition which obtains in the finan­

18

cial world today -- and it is not without some degree >of irony

19

that the day on which this Court granted certiorari the prime

20

rate was set at 19 percent, which is not available to the

21

average taxpayer, of course, at prime.
Now, is it -- and this is a second question, or a

22
23
24

25

sequel.

Does it deny due process to the citizenry of Illinois

merely to have a remedy which merely after an hiatus of two
or more years gives back far less than the state took,
31

1

meanwhile allowing the state to use that taxpayer's money to

2

generate interest for the state which the county treasurer is

allowed to do?

9

seems to be more generic.
QUESTION:

10

If it were speedy so that you got it in

1 1

60 days, you wouldn't be making all this argument about the

12

dollar and the inflation and the use of the money.
MR. FOX:

13

On the other hand -- I would not say that

14

either, sir, quite; because if we're looking at a basic con­

15

stitutional deprivation to begin with, somehow or other that

16

For instance:

17

tion of high taxes or high assessments were motivated by ethnic:

18

or religious or racial considerations on the part of the

19

Assessor of Cook County, is it proper relief, is it adequate

20

relief to say, oh, go ahead, Mr. Polish, or Mr. Irish, or

21

Mr. Italian taxpayer, in this particular neighborhood, pay your

22
23

taxes in full under protest, sue for refund, and then in 60
days you can get your money back?
QUESTION:

24

25

let us suppose that this constitutional depriva­

it?

Well, that's just what 1341 says, isn’t

You cannot enjoin in federal court the situation that you
35

1

specify,

2

if it's a tax -- if it's limited to taxation.
MR. FOX:

I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the

3

fact that this insult occurs as a result of a constitutional

4

deprivation removes so-called irreparable injury, removes this

5

period of time, pure time. For instance -- and I would refer,

6

let's say, to the case of Henry v. Greenville Airport, which

7

was cited in our brief, which states that when a constitutional

8

right is invaded like this, that questions of irreparable

9

injury and the like are not even properly considered.
QUESTION:

10
11

But 1341 purports to impose a prohibition

over and above the normal injunctive precautions, doesn't it?
MR. FOX:

12

That is right.

And again, however, we are

13

in a theoretical area when we say, if 'the next day you could

14

get your money back -- which is absolutely impossible under

15

the Cook County collection procedures, because you pay your

16

taxes over a period of six months and are not able to sue until,

17

about nine months after the taxes have been paid in the first

18

instance.
QUESTION:

19

20
21

22

mind?

Presumably there isn't a jurisdiction in the country

that is going to give you your taxes back on the same day you
pay them under protest.
MR.

23
24

What would be a reasonable limit, in your

way?

FOX:

Would 20 days be sufficient?

I think -- may I answer this in another

I think that there is -- personally, that injunctive

relief should

lie: at either the state level to provide an

25

36

1

adequate remedy, immediate injunction at the state level to

2

provide

3

requiring a taxpayer, as here, to pay 3-1/2 times the just

4

taxes merely to have the right to go in to sue to have them

5

come back.

6

an

adequate

QUESTION:

remedy,

or

some

other

remedy

than

So you say the state remedy contemplated

7

by 1341 must be injunctive in nature?

8

protest and ultimate refund, even in a very short period of

9

time, isn't adequate?

10

MR. FOX:

That's right.

That a payment under

My own personal opinion,

1 1

however, I think that if Illinois paid reasonable interest on

12

tax refunds, commensurate with the market today, I do not thinl

13

that we would be before this Court today.

14

15

16
17

18
19

QUESTION:

And you didn't do it because you knew you

couldn't make them pay it.
MR. FOX:

We couldn't make it, we couldn't make it.

I have to cite -- we have been told that there is a possibility
out there of a 1983 action, but we have three cases in Illinois
in which the issue has been presented to the Illinois court -and the Illinois court has

with these federal equal protec­

20

tion due process claims,, and the Illinois Supreme Court came
21

back and said, you can test those claims by paying your taxes
22

in full and suing out a refund, and you can get an answer to
23

your constitutional claims.

It did that in the case of

24

La Salle National v. the County of Cook in the 57 Illinois 2d,
25

37

1

which we have cited.

2

Fulton Market Cold Storage Company at the appellate level and

3

then at the Supreme Court level, again a case cited in our

4

brief.

5

tion v. Gunderson, the Illinois court, the appellate court,

6

aware of the decision of the 7th Circuit in this case, said,

7

furthermore, our own state Supreme Court's clear rulings in

8

Lakefront and Lorenz, and Clarendon, stating that the remedy is

9

adequate without interest, remain controlling precedent on us,

It did the same thing in the case of

And as recently as this last year in Chrysler Corpora­

10

as on all Illinois courts, unless reversed by that court or

1 1

by the United States Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

That case is not in your brief, is it,

counsel?

MR. FOX:

All this discussion, arid I've contributed

It's in the response to the petition, sir.

to it, talking about the specific words, has maybe taken us off
of what was the genesis of the Anti-Injunction Act?

Wasn't it

21

to mandate a direction to the federal courts to keep hands off

22

of state tax procedures?

23
24

25

Just let the states work it out on

their own?
MR. FOX:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

genesis of that

Act was the problem encountered under 1332 jurisdiction, where
38

foreign corporations were coming into the several states and

2

enjoining state tax collections.

remarks in the legislative history.

really, as/or against citizens of the state itself

actions.
QUESTION:

tinction, does it?

9

MR. FOX:

That's in Senator Bone's
I think there are -- at
It is not a protection,
bringing

Well, but the Act doesn't make any dis­

No.

It does not.

But the genesis which

10

you referred to is found in the problems of big interstate

1 1

companies coming in, using diversity where people couldn't do

12

it locally, and if you recall at that time, they couldn't use

13

1343 because this was all pre-Household v. Lynch.
QUESTION:

14

15

sued for a refund and it was -- in the state courts?
MR. FOX:

16

21

22
23
24

Or do you do it administratively?

You do

file it in a state court?
MR. FOX:

19

20

Yes, sir?

QUESTION:

17

18

Could I ask you, if you paid the tax and

In a state court it's 'the'.statutory proce­

dure .
QUESTION:

And in that case you could present your

federal constitutional question?
MR. FOX:

Yes.

And the court said that, and

La Salle testified -QUESTION:

Yes, well, all right, but now, if you won

25

39

1

on your constitutional argument, your colleague suggested that

2

the state would pay interest.

3
4

MR. FOX:

No, sir, because the State has unequivo­

cally stated in all -QUESTION:

5

I know, but I thought the State had said

6

only that without adjudicating the constitutional point.

7

Suppose the state courts had themselves decided that the

8

assessment was unconstitutional, and that you deserved a

9

refund.

10

Have the state courts then said there would be no

interest payable?
MR. FOX:

1 1

Yes.

There is no interest payable, because

12

the Illinois law is, no interest without a statute providing

13

for interest, and there is no statute in Illinois.
QUESTION:

14

15
16

Whether or not the assessment is consti­

tutional ?
MR. FOX:

That’s right.

Furthermore, the Illinois

17

Legislature has had before it twice within the last four or

18

five years bills to provide interest on tax refunds.

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

QUESTION: Well, didn't you understand the State to
argue to the contrary or not?

Did I miss any — I must have

misunderstood your colleague, here for the State?
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

I did not understand him to say that.
Okay.

Thank you.

There is no interest payable in Illinois

without a statute, and there is no statute and the Illinois
40

1

Legislature has turned down such a statute twice within the

2

last three or four legislative sessions.

3

I will

not address, because of Mr. Justice Stewart's

4

interrogation of my colleague here, the collateral issues

5

which were raised on this particular, in the briefs, such as

6

as the 1343 argument and the other arguments that were raised.

7

Counsel has adverted, however, on several occasions

8

to the question of the state remedies of 1983.

9

grounds for a state 1983 remedy.

There is no

In fact in a damage action,

10

as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out, there just isn't any

11

case to which you can point.

12

Note 1 in Maine v. Thiboutat pointed out, that the state must

13

hear a 1983 action, and I can think of nothing more intrusive

14

by the federal judiciary into the state than to require the

15

State of Illinois, let's say, first to hear that kind of 1983

16

action; secondly, to grant an injunction or damages; thirdly,

17

perhaps, to grant attorneys' fees, which are not provided for

18

under the statute, or to pay interest, or to waive its exhaust

19

tion of administrative remedies, which the State absolutely

20
21

22
23
24

25

There is no rule, of course, as

declined, the court in the State absolutely declined to do in
the Fulton Market case, which we have cited, because that was
taken up on a 1983 case, citing Monroe v. Pape, Damico,
McNeese, and the other cases, for failure to exhaust notwith­
standing a constitutional deprivation.
The Supreme Court of Illinois shook its head and
41

1

said, no, after the appellate court had overruled the trial

2

court.

3

to reach that issue, the plaintiff here did not exhaust his

4

administrative remedies, and notwithstanding any federal claims

5

and so forth which were briefed and argued, we're not going to

6

waive our exhaustion relief.

The Supreme Court reversed and said, no, we don't have

Counsel, I think, has been most forthright in saying

7

8

that he cannot speak for the Illinois court, that he cannot

9

assure us that there would be any remedy under 1983 or any

10

other remedy in the Illinois court.

If you win --

if you're allowed to main­

13

tain your action in the federal court and you get an injunc­

14

tion, you win on your equal protection ground; you wouldn't

15

expect to get interest?
MR. FOX:

16

No, sir.

No, sir.

The only possibility,

17

Mr. Justice White, under those circumstances would be that

under the rationale of Fulton Market v. Cullerton, that we

might go back at a later date and sue for whatever other ex­

You're asking for the injunction, and

even if you ask for damages you wouldn't get interest as
damages.
MR. FOX:

Well, you see, truthfully, if we got an
42

1

injunction, one, we would not have to pay the unjust moiety.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. FOX:

All right.
Secondly, under 1988, we would be entitled

to our client's attorneys' fees, so that the client would be

Mr. Fox, if the State of Illinois amended

15

its procedure to allow interest at something that may be less

16

than the prime rate, provided no recovery of attorneys' fees

17

or anything else, would it then be an adequate remedy, in

MR. FOX:

If it were -- Mr. Justice Stevens, if it

were reasonable interest in the line with the market.

I merely

point out -QUESTION:

Say, it's the same provision they have,

whatever the interest rate is, on judgments now?

I don't know

what it is.
MR. FOX:

That really does not square with reality

4-3

1

in Illinois at the present time.

2

State, it's six percent.

3

Section 482 is now talking a range of 11 to 13 percent.

think the court would then have to face a due process question

5

in the amount of interest.

is another question.

up, Mr. Justice Stewart, but is the payment -- is the taking of
money today and giving it back in a lesser amount sometime
hence, is that itself a denial of due process?
