ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. DOLOWITZ

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8
9

MR. DOLOWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The question before the Court today involves the

11

validity of a Utah statute which provides that before an abor­

12

tion may be provided to a minor, her parents must be notified

13

if it is physically possible to do so.

14

The facts of the case involved a 15-year-old minor

15

who determined she was in the first trimester of an undesired

16

pregnancy, spoke with her social worker, determined that she

17

should terminate that pregnancy.

18

her parents should not be involved, then consulted her treating

19

physician -QUESTION:

20

21

22
23

She determined further that

The -- now, who's "she"?

The social

worker?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

No.

At this point the woman herself

contacted the doctor and the doctor also had a social worker
working with him.

They consulted with her, determined with the

24

social workers, the physicians, that her parents should not be
25
3

1

notified.

2
QUESTION:

Now, who made that determination?

3

MR. DOLOWITZ:

That determination was made,

4

Mr. Justice Stewart, by the woman, the doctor, and the social
5

worker.

6

QUESTION:

7
8

By H. L.

MR. DOLOWITZ:

All of them felt that the parents

should not be involved.

9

QUESTION:

Where in the record, counsel, is the

10

finding or testimony that the doctor felt the parents should not

11

be consulted?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

12
13

part of her testimony when she testified.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DOLOWITZ:

16

That is in the complaint, and that was

Could you cite the pages?
I can only refer the Court to the

transcript of -QUESTION:

17

I read the transcript.

The physician felt

18

he could

19

didn't read the transcript to find any place that he felt it

20

21

22
23

not do it without consulting the parents.

But I

was in her best interest that the parents not be consulted.
QUESTION:

Wasn't it a matter of notice to the

parents rather than consulting the parents?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Yes, it was.

Well, it is a matter of

notice rather than consultation and if I said "consultation,"
24

I misspoke myself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
25

4

It's a question of

1

2

that they should not be given notice of it.
QUESTION:

Now, where in the transcript or findings do

3

you find anything that the physician thought it was contrary to

4

her best medical interest that her parents not be notified?

5

MR. DOLOWITZ:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DOLOWITZ:

That's what he told her as --

Where in what we have before us?
I believe that is in her testimony.

8

I was looking at it.

It is definitely testified by her that

9

her counselor -- and I am looking in the pages 24 through 26 --

-- of the appendix, Mr. Chief Justice.

And she said that she should go ahead without notifying -QUESTION:

Could you give us the verbatim?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

I am looking now at her testimony and

I am going down page 25:
"Q

You consulted with a counselor that you were

pregnant, or about the pregnancy?
A

Yeah.

Q

You determined after talking to the counselor

18
19

that you should get an abortion?
20

A

Yes.

You felt that

parents -23

24

You didnot

feel for

your

own reasons you could discuss it with them?

Right.

Q

After discussing the matter with your counselor

you still believed you should not discuss it with your

parents —
A

Right.

Q

-- and that they should not be notified?

A

Right.

Q

After talking the matter over with your counselor

and the counselor concurred in your decision that your
parents should not be notified --

2

A

Right.

3

Q

-- you were notified, you were advised that an

4

abortion could not be performed without notifying them --

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

-- you came to see me about filing the suit.

7

A

Yes .

8

Q

You and I then discussed as to whether or not you

9

20
21
22
23

had a right to do what you wanted to do?
A

Yes .

Q

You decided after our discussion you should still

proceed with the action to try to obtain an abortion without notifying your parents?
A

Right.

Q

Now, at the time you signed the complaint, spoke

24
25

6

1

with the counselor and with me, you were in the first tri­
2

mester pregnancy within your first 12 weeks of pregnancy?
3

A

Yes.

4

Q
5

Do you feel that from talking to the counselor

and thinking the situation over and discussing it with me,

6

that you could make the decision on your own that you wish

7

to abort the pregnancy?

8

A

9

MR. DOLOWITZ:

10

13
14

And then it goes on to say, "You were

living at home."

11
12

Yes."

QUESTION:

Mr. Dolowitz, is that you testifying or

the
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Oh, I'm asking the questions that she

is answering; right.

15

QUESTION:

Well, all she says is "yes."

16

MR. DOLOWITZ:

That's correct, Your Honor, and if

17

I may say so, I led her through this very carefully and the rea­

18

son that I did that is, she had a highly unique fact situation,

19

20

and as you read through the appendix you saw that this examina­
tion took place after the Court had already denied a preliminary
injunction and had ruled that the peculiar facts of her circum­

21

stances made no difference.

It was -- the only question, under

22

the Utah statute, the trial judge felt, was whether it- was phy­
23

sically possible to notify her.

Because then, Mr. Justice

24

Rehnquist, after this, you see there's about ten pages of
25

7

1

colloquy between the court and -2
QUESTION:

Do you think that any of what you have read

3

from the testimony so far supports a finding that her doctor
4

told her that it was in her -- not in her best medical interests
5

to get an abortion?
6
7

8
9
10

11

MR. DOLOWITZ:

In terms of the record, it does not.

Now, what happened there is I forgot to ask her that question.
QUESTION:

Well, in your --

MR. DOLOWITZ:

I had spoken with the doctor myself

and the doctor told her that and I talked to her.
QUESTION:

In your statement of the case, in your

12

brief, Mr. Dolowitz, you say, "In consultation with both her

13

physician and social worker, she determined that it was in her

14

best medical interest that she be aborted and that her parents

15

not be notified of either her decision or its implementation."

16

MR. DOLOWITZ:

17

QUESTION:

18
19
20

21

22
23
24
25

I do, sir, and that is the finding.

And that's a fair paraphrase of what you

read us, isn't it?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Yes, it is, Mr. Justice Stewart.

That

is the finding of the court, of the trial court.
QUESTION:

But it is not a finding that the doctor

told her it was against her best interest?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

It is not a -- it is a finding, I be­

lieve, and I at this point would have to refer the trial court
-- or this Court, Your Honor, to the specific findings,
8

1

2
3
4

conclusions of law and in the findings that I'm referring to
I am looking at page 40, Finding 7, of the Findings of Fact,
page 40 of the appendix, where the trial court made the deter­
mination that she should be aborted and that he felt -- that's

5

the doctor -- that it was not in her best medical interest to

6

do -- or was in her best medical interest to do so, but could

7

not and would not perform an abortion on her without informing

8

her parents prior to aborting her because of the statute.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Do.lowitzyou

have emphasized in

10

your oral argument -- you have spent quite a bit of time on

11

it, and our questions, and you did in the examination, direct

12

examination of your witness, the importance, you have emphasizec.

13

the importance of getting counsel and advice and assistance,

14

lawyers, social workers, doctors.

15

that she had the advice and counsel of all these people?

16

MR. DOLOWITZ:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

And you rest on the fact

Yes, Mr. Justice.

What if she has the advice of no one?

Just walked in off the street and said, I want to have an
abortion, and the doctor said, not unless I notify the parents.
No other factors.

Would this be any different from the points

20
that you have got here?
21

MR. DOLOWITZ:

Factually it would, Your Honor.

22
QUESTION:

And fadtually, would it be --

23

MR. DOLOWITZ:

It would.

But legally, in terms of

24

the position I'm taking today, I am speculating -- I would
25

9

1

say, no.

2
3

QUESTION:

You don't need to speculate on that, do

you?

4

MR. DOLOWITZ:

5
6

And the reason that I would --

QUESTION:

You don't need to speculate on the Consti­

tutional question, do you?

7

MR. DOLOWITZ:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DOLOWITZ:

10

What?

No.

I would say --

It would make no difference, would it?
No.

If she has the right of privacy,

to go ahead on her own, then she has that right.

11

QUESTION:

Now, she's 15 years old, isn't she?

12

MR. DOLOWITZ:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DOLOWITZ:

That's correct.

Suppose she were 12?

Same?

I would -- the problem, Your Honor, is

15

I've — then I move to speculation and I move to it in a very

16

difficult area, and that is the level of maturity is such that

17
18
19

as a 12-year-old she could be very mature, totally immature;
though we're leaving something out, and that is that she is
talking to a doctor and says, I want an abortion.

But you're

leaving out that the state has already said, who is going to
20

practice medicine and what are reasonable standards?

And the

21

physician is going to say, I have a right to make a decision
22

whether it's in your best medical interest and I'm not going to
23

take an action which is in opposition to your best medical
24

interest.

And if the 12-year-old that you have asked me about

25

10

1

the doctor feels cannot rationally make that decision in her
2

own best interest, he --

3

QUESTION:

•

MR. DOLOWITZ:
5

I would give you the same answer.

I think that you're dealing with a doctor-patient decision

6

where the doctor who the state has said is licensed to practice

7

medicine should be able to deal with his patient, and a minor,

8

and deal without the outside influences; talk to that patient

9

and say, at the end of that discussion, I'm not going to do

10

this without your parents, I'm going to do this with your

11

parents.

12
^

What about ten years of age?

QUESTION:

In Utah, under Utah law, if she had walked

13

in, a girl of 10, 11, 12, 15, whatever, and said, I want my

14

tonsils taken out but my parents won't send me to a doctor and

IS

won't agree to it, would the doctor be legally permitted to

16

perform the tonsillectomy?

17
18
19
20
21

MR. DOLOWITZ:

There is no law that prohibits it, but

I believe that most physicians would not do it.
QUESTION:

But there is --

Because of the possibility of a malprac­

tice ail it, among other things, I suppose.
MR. DOLOWITZ:

There is a difference, though, and

that is the decision of this Court in Danforth and Bellotti II,
W

22
23

and a statute of the State of Utah which states that a minor
of any age can consent to any treatment regarding pregnancy.

24

QUESTION:

Mr. Dolowitz, would you straighten me out?

25

11

1

I want to be sure about this.

On page 25 of the appendix -- do

2
you have it in front of you?
3

MR. DOLOWITZ:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

4

QUESTION:

question:

Down just below the middle there is a

the counselor concurred in your decision that your parents
should be notified" is what it says.
put a "not" in there.

Now, when you read it, you

Should the "not" be in there?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

It should have been, because if it

10

wasn't, then I misspoke it at the time.

11

clear, all the way through, from the time that she came in,

12

that she had spoken to her counselor, she had spoken to her

13

counselors and her physician before she came to me, and that

14

they all felt that this was a very unique situation and she

15

should not, her parents simply shouldn't be notified.

16

QUESTION:

Because it was very

Well, all I want to know is, whether you

17

and opposing counsel agree that this is an error in the

18

printing of the transcript, that the "not" is in there?

19
20

21
22
23
24
25

MR. TINKER:

Yes.

MR. DOLOWITZ:

I agree, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Now, Your Honor, what we are dealing

with -- as you can see; and I realize from your questions,
Mr. Chief Justice, that you're very concerned about the age of
the woman involved.

The problem is that I think that Utah has

overstepped in doing that by saying that a parent must be noti­
fied in every case.

Because just as I answered to you that the
12

1

physician must be involved in making that decision -2
3
4

QUESTION:

statute might be constitutional

7

if

it

fixed the limit at

age 12 or 14?

5
6

Then are you saying that it might, the

MR. DOLOWITZ:

No, Your Honor, I would not.

say itwould be unconstitutional if it did that.

But

I would
if it

said that the physician -- if the words "if possible" -- and

8

this, in fact, is I urged the Utah -- on the construction I

9

urged on the Utah Supreme Court -- the language, if possible,

10

should be construed

11

that, if the doctor in consultation with his patient feels that

12

the parents should be notified, consulted, brought in, however

to mean, "if medically appropriate",

3

that's to be phrased, that would be a rational statute, because

4

it would be reasonable, it could be done.
QUESTION:

5

But could it not also, could that phrase

6

not also

7

abandoned by her parents, didn't know where her parents were,

8

her parents impossible to reach, that sort of thing?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

9

QUESTION:

20

23
24
25

Yes, and that --

Isn't that what the statute is aimed at?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

2

22

be intended to take into account a child who had been

Your Honor, the answer I'm going to

say is that that might have been the intention and they added
-- the Utah Supreme Court said, if possible, within a rational
time.

And the problem is, that makes it very vague, as to

precisely what it means.

And the problem that then comes from
13

1

that is, if you say, well, you know, if physically possible,
2

like if they're on a trip, if they're somewhere else.

You stil]

3

have the same problem. But what happens if they're on the trip?
4

But you have a social worker or a doctor who knows that family
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

and says, gee, I'm glad they're on that trip; it is best not to
notify them.

So what happens when they're in town and he still

feels it's best not to notify them?
why that is good.

I can explain the reasons

I think Mr. Justice Powell in the Bellotti I]

decision did a very careful description of the reasons why a
parent should not be notified.
I think there's a tendency to mix up the concept of

12

notification and consultation, assuming that if you notify the

13

parents you're going to bring them into consultation.

14

isn't always true, that you bring parents in, and frequently

15

you bring them in, and have the result that that will cause

16

more trouble, if it's an abusive parent.

17

for a religious reason doesn't agree, they will impose their

18

values on a child.

19

the statute:

20
21

22
23
24
25

But that

If it's a parent who

Now, on that case, this is the problem with

instead of being able to respond to the very par­

ticularized questions you asked me, Mr. Chief Justice, this is
a broad, it's an all-inclusive statute.

It disregarded the

concerns that this Court has stated, that in this area a sta­
tute that's drawn should be drawn very narrowly, and very care­
fully, and consider the interests of the minor.
asked me about a 10-year-old, a 12-year-old.
14

Because you

That's not what

1

I'm talking about.
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

Those are some of the circumstances.

But

Utah doesn't take any consideration into that.
H. L. -- you asked me when we started about a lot of
the facts in this case.

There is also another case that was

filed between the decision of the Utah Supreme Court and the
granting or

taking of jurisdiction by this Court in this case.

It was filed in the United States District Court for the Dis­
trict of Utah.

In that case four women have been granted in­

junctions and allowed to obtain abortions by the determination

10

of the trial judge in that case that they were mature minors,

11

handling their own affairs — one of them had another child --

12

who, on their own, could make the decision, and in fact it

13

would be detrimental to them to have their parents notified.

14
15
16

QUESTION:
were they not?

Those four plaintiffs were all emancipated

Not living with the parents?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

Three of the four were; one was still

17

living at home.

18

Office if the Court wishes to pursue that so that, the findings

19

the conclusions, the orders, in each of those four cases -- the

20
21

22
23
24
25

And I've lodged the papers with the Clerk's

first one is included as an appendix to my brief.

The other

three I've lodged with the Clerk's Office.
Now, in each of those cases, they were mature minors
and it was, and the trial judge, Judge Jenkins, determined that
it would be detrimental to the parent-child relationship to
notify the parents, in some cases because there'd been a split.
15

1

3

That's why the child had left; things were getting better.
would be broken out.

That

These are just illustrations as to the

overbreadth of the statute.

4

Then there's a second set of problems that come up,

5

and that is the doctor-patient relationship has been invaded by

6

this statute.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Dolowitz, before you leave those other

8

cases, I don't understand their relevance to the issue presentee

9

by this case.
MR. DOLOWITZ:

10

The relevance, Mr. Justice Stevens,

11

tends to come from the observations of Mr. Justice Powell in the

12

second Bellotti decision, and that is that as applied to two --

13

I will call them categories of minors -QUESTION:

14
15
16

stitutional as applied to a lot of people who are not before the
Court.

19

20

Assume that.

How does that help you in this case?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

17
18

Well, let's say that the statute is uncon­

In this case we're dealing with a

subgroup of a minor where the determination had been made by
the social worker and the physician that it was not in her best
interest, and the trial court -QUESTION:

I thought you just agreed with Mr. Justice

21

Rehnquist that there was no such determination, the child so
22

determined after consultation with the doctor and the social
23

worker?
24

MR. DOLOWITZ:

If I said that, then that was not what

25

16

1

I meant.

I think the determination was made by the social

2

workers, by the doctor, by the woman.
3

QUESTION:

You don't suggest anything that you read

4

from the transcript said the doctor said it was not in her best
5
6
7

8
9
10

11

interest to notify the parents?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Nothing that I read said that, and that

means that when I asked the questions in the trial, I stopped
one question too soon, because -QUESTION:

We review questions or cases on tran­

scripts, not on unasked questions.
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Well, I realize that, Mr. Justice

12

Rehnquist, and one of the problems that was going on in this

13

case was that from the prior determination of the trial judge

14

that the only question that he considered important is, was it

15

physically possible to locate the parents, meant that I was

16

conducting that hearing with her to simply show that the facts

17

alleged in the complaint were in fact correct.

18

we got into the questions, as you see, Mr. McCarthy asked her

19

the question of, you know, do you feel you can't discuss this

20
21

22
23
24
25

with your parents?

And she said, "Right."

And then, when

And he said, do

you feel you can't discuss other problems with your parents?
And she said "Right."

And he said, what other problems?

at that point I objected.

Have you got something in the record about giving notice?

QUESTION:

Well -- no, no, the possibility, the capa­

bility, the feasibility of writing a letter to the parents.

9

MR. DOLOWITZ:

I believe — okay; no.

But there was

10

no question in terms of my representations to the judge, the

11

discussion as far as Mr. Tinker and Mr. McCarthy were concerned

12

whether she could physically, her parents could be located.

13

And I believe Mr. McCarthy asked her those questions and she

responded that they could, that she went -- again, I think

QUESTION:

Had the doctor written a letter simply

stating the simple, direct fact that, your daughter has come to
me to have an abortion performed and I'm prepared to do it, and
under the statute I'm giving you notice that I will proceed
with this procedure seven days from today, would he have

MR. DOLOWITZ:

been no consultation with anyone.

Is the counseling of any relevance here to a

constitutional question?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

I believe it is not.

Now, I -- when

12

I answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, I answer that knowing that

13

a number of the members of this Court have expressed themselves

14

in these opinions that you believe that it is, it's a wise

15

policy to encourage the family and to some way get the families

16

together so that that counseling occurs, so that -- I say that

17

with some degree of trepidation when I say, no, but I say it wit h

18

the knowledge that when she is initially going to someone who

19

the State of Utah has licensed as a physician, and said that,

20
21

22
23
24
25

to this regard, you have to counsel.

So, in this

they

weren't

saying that there may not be mandatory counseling, in that sense
But you're asking me, does the fact that she had that counsel­
ing make it any different than if she had just walked in to the
doctor and to the constitutional issue, I say, no, because this
state mandates, this statute mandates that in all cases.
19

1

But I say that with the knowledge that you have, that at least
2

a number of the members of this Court feel that there should be
3

some counseling.

And I say that it in fact exists because the

4

physicians provide it.
5
6
7
8
9

And a physician is not in a position

where he is going to simply go ahead and perform it without,
that type of counseling without knowing that, if you want to
call it this way, his license is at risk, his malpractice
insurance is at risk, if he commits a malpractice or a violatior
of a licensing statute.

And in fact, that same protection is

10

insidiously, I feel, undermined in this case because it moves

11

in and if a doctor is in a situation where the minor who comes

12

in and they sit down, no counselor, no social workers at all,

13

and the counseling takes place one to one and the doctor says,

14

you should be aborted, your parents should not be notified, in

15

my best medical judgment, but I can't do it because of this

16

statute.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dolowitz, I think you referred us

to this Finding 7, didn't you, at page 40?

19

MR. DOLOWITZ:

20

QUESTION:

21

22
23
24
25

Yes, sir.

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

Am I to read that finding as you have j.ust

stated the proposition, that after consultation -- or rather,
when consulting with her physician, he advised her that she
should be aborted, that he was unwilling to perform an abortion
without complying with the provisions of the statute even
though he believed it was best to do so, or to perform the
20

1

abortion without complying with the statute?
2

Is that the way

we're supposed to read that?

3

MR. DOLOWITZ:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, he was not willing to do it.

Is that the way you want us to read that?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

I want you to read that as saying that

6

he felt in his best medical judgment, one, an abortion should

7

be performed; secondly, that her parents should not be notified;

8

third, that he was not willing to act on his best medical judg­

9

ment, which was to abort her, without notifying her parents

10

because he was at criminal risk if he did so.

11

12

QUESTION:

That's what we read into it, even though he

believed it was best to do so.

13

MR. DOLOWITZ:

14

QUESTION:

Do so.

It's a very ambiguous finding, isn't it,

15

if you read it with all the nuances that Mr. Justice Brennan

16

puts in it?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

trial judge and counsel we were not able to articulate it -QUESTION:

Did you submit the findings?

Did you draft

the findings?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

22
23

What I have just expressed to you is

I drafted the findings, Mr. Justice

White.
QUESTION:

Were they entered exactly as you drew them?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

They were, after dispute.

words, the State submitted its set, Mr. Tinker -2

MR. DOLOWITZ:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

MR. DOLOWITZ:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Mr. Dolowitz, does the record in fact show

whether she was aborted?

8
9

Verbatim?

MR. DOLOWITZ:

The record does not show that.

What I

am trying to indicate to Mr. Justice White in responding is

10

that both of us submitted the findings.

11

asked us both to come in and we talked, and Mr. Tinker and I

12

both communicated with him.

13

occurred in, I believe, April or May and the entry did not

14

occur until, I think, it's November or December.

15

part of that was the question over the findings, getting the

16

transcript made, and going back over the questions that had

17

been presented.

ture -- have essentially said something to the effect as fol­
lows:

yes, we recognize that it is not possible under the

Constitution for us to exercise any kind of absolute veto or
place a roadblock, an absolute roadblock, in the way of our
minor daughter who is living at home and who may seek to have
an abortion.

And it should be noted that we've conceded this

10

even in, as early as 1974, which is when this statute was

11

enacted, which precedes both the Danforth decision and the

12

first Bellotti decision.

3

But, even if we may not veto the decision of our minor

4

daughter living at home who chooses to have an abortion, we at

5

least want to know about it.

MR. TINKER:

No.

Then why are you putting those words in

your description of the statute?
MR. TINKER:

Merely for emphasis, in that that is who

the statute is primarily intended to control.

The statute

speaks in terms of minors, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION:

Yes, but how do we know that?

There are

many emancipated minors even in Utah, I would assume.
MR. TINKER:

Well, and I think that is precisely the
23

separate question which is raised by this other case that

Mr. Dolowitz has referred to, and which Mr. Justice Stevens has
questioned the relevance here.

that the question of the emancipated minor is not before this
Court, is not part of this record.

QUESTION:

It is --

The statute does not refer to an emanci­

pated minor or an unemancipated one.

MR. TINKER:

QUESTION:

10

I would suggest to this Court

That's true.
I’d like to look at the case in the face of

your statute.

11

MR. TINKER:

Right.

And the statute on its face

12

describes only "minors."

13

think is entirely relevant in this case, but is clearly the

14

heart of this other case that is still pending, is whether

15

under Utah law, as a matter of construction of Utah law, that

16

term minor includes emancipated minors.
QUESTION:

17

And my suggestion, which I don't

18

She is --

assume that the Supreme Court of your State has already decided

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
She's not — in this case, the statute is

not being challenged as applied, but it's simply being chal­
lenged on its face, isn't it?
MR. TINKER:

Yes.

But I would see the facial chal­

lenge as being substantially different if there were an authori­
tative construction of the statute that said it cannot, by

24

virtue of state law, apply to emancipated minors.

Do you see any inherent conflict between

the Federal court case and this one?
MR. TINKER:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not.

The

16

Federal trial court judge has taken pains in his findings to

17

differentiate between what the Utah Supreme Court found.

18

has felt that that decision is binding as far as state law is

19

concerned, so far as it goes.

20
21

22
23
24
25

He

And he sees this as presenting a

different class and a different issue.

That's why I suggest

that that case is irrelevant in this case as it presently stands
before this Court.
QUESTION:

But, Mr. Tinker, the class described in

the complaint, as I understand the trial judge, he did in
effect say the class was proper,
26

includes all minor women

1

who are suffering unwanted pregnancies and desire to terminate
2

them, which would include the emancipated minors as well as the
3

unemancipated minors.
4
5
6
7

There is nothing in the Supreme Court of Utah's opinion that
says, we are only deciding the question presented by the named
plaintiff as opposed to the class as a whole

which had been

certified.

8
9

I'm looking at page 5 of the appendix.

MR. TINKER:

But I'm not sure, Mr. Justice Stevens,

that that alone, the fact that the class was not defined to

10

exclude all these others, permits the named plaintiff to repre­

11

sent a class that she's not part of.

12

QUESTION :

Except that-as a matter of s.tate law the state

13

judge said she's an adequate representative.

14

would apply equally to emancipated or unemancipated, and the

15

reasoning of the Utah Supreme Court would apply equally to both

16

Now, maybe the Federal cases are different, but it seems that

17

if you have a class which as a matter of state law includes

18

emancipated minors, and the Supreme Court of the State disposed

19

of the case on the assumption that they were all before the

20

Court, we have that issue, and I don't know why we shouldn't

And his reasoning

decide it.
QUESTION/:

Unless, as a matter of Federal constitu­

tional law, a particular plaintiff doesn't have standing to
make a particular argument.
QUESTION:

That's right.
27

And the trial judge did

1

2
3
4

confine it, as I read his opinion on page 14, the last part of
it, "under the facts involved here where the woman in question
is aged 15, unmarried, resides at home with her parents and is
dependent upon them for support, and where the identity of the

5

parents is either known to the physician or easily ascertain­

6

able by him."

7

He did indicate that his reasoning, at least, was

8

confined to the facts of this case in upholding the facial con­

9

stitutionality of the statute.

10

the Supreme Court of Utah did.

Maybe we shouldn't

take your time with this.
MR. TINKER:

Well, I think the class was essentially

defined at that preliminary stage and it was not changed in
the subsequent proceedings.
Let me suggest, further, what the Legislature of the
State of Utah was doing.

They're saying that with respect to

minors generally we as parents forego any claim to being able
21

to veto an abortion decision.

But if there is to be an abor­

22

tion performed, we simply want notice of it.
23

QUESTION:

A little due process for the parents, is

24

that what you're saying?

Mr. Chief Justice.

That's exactly what I'm saying,

And we want to know about it.

We would

ideally like to have some input, perhaps some consultation.
But even by this statute we do not mandate that.

The statute

on its face could be satisfied as one of the briefs has sug­
gested by a mere telephone call at a certain point prior to the
performance of the abortion, advising that the abortion will

take place.

That might not be an entirely satisfactory kind of

think, to preclude any criminal penalty upon the doctor.

12

QUESTION:

And what does that accomplish?

Does that

13

enable the physician to exercise his best medical judgment a

14

little better?
MR. TINKER:

15

Among other things.

He may, Mr. Justice

16

Blackmun, obtain additional information that he might not know

The parents are saying, we not only want

a little due process, but they're saying, we would like to

in this matter.

We recognize that the trend of things, if you

2
will, in our society is very much in the direction that abor­

Not that our viewpoint could be binding, by any means, and not

It's really thrown back entirely into the

QUESTION:

Is it possible the Legislature had in mind

14

that -- or is it possible that it's inherent in the case, that

15

the parents might be able to give something of the medical his­

16

tory and background of the child which would be relevant to the

17

doctor and his decision?

18

MR. TINKER:

Well, the Utah Supreme Court in its

19

unanimous decision made that specific finding but that would be

20

one of the purposes.

21

MR. TINKER:

I'm afraid it does, Mr. Justice Brennan,

on the face of the statute.

5

6

Does that do it?

QUESTION:

As I say, I don't --

Then how much input does this contemplate

that the parents will have?

7

MR. TINKER:

Well, it contemplates, I think, only as

8

much as the doctor in his professional judgment will permit.

9

But I think most doctors, given the requirement that they must

10

go at least that far, will at least be willing to hear a few

11

things.

Now, this gets us off into speculation again.

The statute doesn't require them to go beyond what I

15

MR. TINKER:

16

QUESTION:

Clearly not; clearly not.
What if the mother in that hypothetical

17

case then said, are you aware, doctor, that our daughter has

18

been under psychiatric care for the last seven years, and the

19

doctor says, no, I'm not aware of that.

20

merely must apply to his medical decision -MR. TINKER:

21

22
23

Is that something he

I think he has -- excuse me, I think he

has a professional obligation to then take that knowledge into
account.

Again, the law of the State of Utah probably does not

compel him to do that unless it were so egregious that it be­
24

came a matter of malpractice.

And in that respect, the statute

25

31

1

may tend to protect the doctor.
2

5

QUESTION:

Well, that might mean, among other things,

that the minor patient was not capable of giving consent to any­
thing, a tonsillectomy, an appendectomy, or an abortion.

Might

it not?

6

MR. TINKER:

It could be.

You have an interesting

7

kind of overlap in my view of legal disabilities that are occa­

8

sioned simply by minority and legal disabilities that are occa­

9

sioned by absolute lack of competency, mental-type lack of

10

competency.

11

same situation here.

You might have those overlapping, fitting in the
I think the teachings of this Court have

2

been that as far as those disabilities which occur as simply

3

because of lack of majority status are somewhat tempered, some­

4

what moderated or modified when you're in the abortion context

5

or in the other contexts regarding the ability to procreate.

6

But there you get into a very difficult situation when you

7

bring both of them in and again you have a difficult kind of

8

balancing problem.
QUESTION:

9

MR. TINKER:

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Tinker?
Yes, Mr. Justice Powell?
In the plurality opinion in Bellotti II

2

we said this with respect to notice:

"We conclude that every

22
23

minor must have the opportunity if she so desires to go
directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her

24

parents."

How do you construe that language, granted, of

25

32

1

course, that it is part of a plurality opinion?
2
3
4
5
6
7

MR. TINKER:

I construe that language as relating to

the situation of the Massachusetts statute which was a consent
statute, not a mere notice statute like ours, and which already
created the possibility of alternatives.

The question of

notice, which is presented in what I would suggest is a pure
form in our particular case because of the nature of the stat­

8

ute, was presented in a much more complicated scheme in the

9

Massachusetts case.

10

QUESTION:

11

the court.

12

There was an alternative in Massachusetts,

No alternative in Utah.
MR. TINKER:

Right.

But the reason there was an

13

alternative in Massachusetts was that there was consent re­

14

quired.

15

don't have to get consent from anybody.

You had to get consent from somebody.

QUESTION:

16

In Utah you

I have that -- I haven't read it recently,

17

but I thought the purpose of the constitutional requirement

18

that the plaintiff, pregnant, unmarried female, be allowed to

19

go to a court was to convince that court that she was a mature

20
21

22
23
24
25

minor.

There's no claim here, is there, that the plaintiff is

a mature minor?
MR. TINKER:

Not in the pleadings of this case or in

the record.
QUESTION:
MR. TINKER:

Not that she's an immature minor, is there1:

to the contrary.

4
5

Are we to assume she's an immature minor?

MR. TINKER:

No, in Utah we don't have a specific pro­

cedure for showing a court any --

9

QUESTION: There wasn't in the Massachusetts legisla­

10

tion either, and that's what we found constitutionally defi­

11

cient, as I remember.

12

MR. TINKER:

My recollection was that the Massachu­

13

setts statute provided that if a parent refused to give consent

14

or was unavailable, that you could then repair to the Court of

Despite the failure to give consent.

But

the Court held, as I remember it, that the minor should be per­
mitted to go to the court for a determination that she was a
mature minor and that therefore no effort to get consent was
required.

But now, as I understand it, in the present case,

Do you have an opinion as to the matter of

First of all, do you have an opinion as a matter of

state law as to whether it

should be construed as a matter of

state law to apply to emancipated minors?

9

MR. TINKER:

Yes, I have an opinion, and my opinion

10

is that it should be construed so as not to apply to an eman­

11

cipated minor.

12

QUESTION:

And is there any judicial authority in the

13

State that has so construed the statute, other than Federal

14

judges?

15

Any State judges?
MR. TINKER:

No.

It has not been before the State

16

courts for that kind of an interpretation.

17

interestingly enough, in contrast to the many abortion kinds of

18

statutes which have been so severely restricted and have been

attacked even before they went into effect, this statute has

that exist.

Does it also exclude a

I was wondering if it is as broad in

that area as it appears to be?
MR. TINKER:

Well, I don't think it applies to marriec

women at all because in Utah the statutory provision is that al]
minors achieve their majority by marriage.
QUESTION:

No, but I'm talking about the requirement

of notice to the husband of a married woman.
MR. TINKER:

Oh.

Well, that -- I see that as a com­

pletely separate problem.
QUESTION:

Oh, if she is not a minor, there is no

requirement of notification.
MR. TINKER:

Right.

But another part of the statute

18

which is not before the Court and not challenged here at all

19

requires notice to the husband and that's what Mr, Justice Steve ns

is referring to.

A

I see a number of factors which

separate problem comes when you try to

determine whether the minor is "mature."

I think that's a

lesser standard and a minor could be mature without being eman­
cipated.

The statute clearly takes in all minors who might be

deemed mature and this comes down merely to a question of

legislative line-drawing, in my view.

sense, as to what constitutes -QUESTION:

17

Aren't you saying that if there's any

MR. TINKER:

Yes, I am saying that, Mr. Justice

Stewart.

In other words, you don't concede that

someone might be 15 and mature?
MR. TINKER:

Oh, I concede that somebody might be but

there's nothing in this record to suggest that anyone is.

QUESTION:

Well, there's nothing to suggest that this

15-year-old is not either, is there, in'this record?
3

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the action of the State

4

Legislature amount to a declaration that prima facie or pre­
5

6
7

sumptively a woman under the age of 18, if not emancipated, is
too immature to make that decision, at least without notice to
the parents?

8

MR. TINKER:

At least without notice, but with no

requirement that the parent can control the decision»- ,

10

QUESTION:

Well, now, let me ask you again, is that

11

to say, if there were evidence in this case that this 15-year-

12

old was mature, then the statute would not apply?

13
14

MR. TINKER:

No, I would not make that argument, sir.

I would not suggest that.

it would not apply?

You seem to agree they can't.

MR. TINKER:

3

5

QUESTION:

Well, no, I'm saying -You said if she's emancipated, the statute

doesn't apply and those are all the things you look at and
decide whether she's emancipated.

6

MR. TINKER:

Yes, I'm saying -- But an emancipated

7

person is not under terms of state law a minor for purposes of

8

the statute.

9

QUESTION:

Did the State make any motion for the

10

Federal District Court to abstain on the question of state law

11

construction?
MR. TINKER:

12

I have argued the abstention question in

13

the L. R. case and Judge Jenkins said that he would not abstain

14

in this particular case because of the exigencies of time.

15

girl was near the end of the first trimester, nearing the point

16

where the possibility of an abortion was complicated if it went

17

longer and he felt that to send this back to a State court

18
19

20

The

would aggravate that situation and so he refused to abstain.
I still propose to ask Judge Jenkins to certify the question to
the Utah Supreme Court, whether -- this precise question that
I've been discussing with Mr. Justice Stevens, of whether an

21

emancipated minor is included in the statute at all.
22

QUESTION:

Does Utah have one of those certification

23

statutes ?
24

MR. TINKER:

I just found out recently that the

25

42

1

3

Utah Supreme Court adopted by a minute entry, it's not in their
Rules, but they've accepted one certification in the past and
they tell me they're willing to accept them.

4

QUESTION:

5

Mr. Tinker, how old is this Utah statute?

MR. TINKER:

The statute was passed in 1974.

That

6

was the point that I thought was significant in that it came

7

before Danforth and before Bellotti I and of course long before

8

Bellotti II.

9

in 1978.

10

It was passed in '74 and challenged in this case

A particular emphasis that I would like to give, just

11

in summary, to this case is that the State of Utah has chosen

12

in this sensitive area to keep the State and its mechanisms,

13

its agencies, and everyone else, far removed from the decision

14

making process.

15

handled within the family context.

16

case as an important case involving what the limits of family

17

participation are, what the rights of the family as a unit are.

18

The appellant has painted a picture of many adverse consequences

19

that might come to a young lady seeking an abortion if her

20
21

22
23
24
25

It has seen this problem as being one to be

parents were notified.

And that's why I see this

The problem is that any of those ad­

verse consequences come purely, if they come at all -- which is
not in the record -- come as a matter of private action of
parents.

There is no state action involved.

The State has no

right to veto an abortion decision, much less does it have the
right to delegate to someone else the right to veto an abortion
43

1

decision.

The State is not trying to do any of those things.

2

The State is merely trying to encourage within the private
3

sphere of action the maximum possible parental knowledge and
4

participation, if that is permitted by the doctor.
5
6

QUESTION:

Was .that always true in the State of Utah

prior to 1973?

7

MR. TINKER:

No, I believe Utah had requirements prior

8

to 1973 that were controlled and invalidated by this Court's

9

1973 decisions.

10

QUESTION:

So that what you've just said didn't apply

to Utah prior to Roe against Wade?

No.
Mr. Dolowitz, do you have

anything further?

The statute adopted in '74 was declared unconstitu­

It was challenged within a few weeks of being adopted.

Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Stevens where they were

those exist in the statute.

If three weeks later they get a divorce, it's determined that
the marriage was a mistake.
QUESTION:

Then it's not --

Well, we don't have that case.

MR. DOLOWITZ:

45

No, we don't.

I can't give you an answer on that.

And

I think you'd lose a lot of weight when

you talk about divorces.
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Why don't you talk about annulments?
Okay.

That's also a problem.

I will

accept that.
QUESTION:

What are you -- you'll lose that point.

'ut'

QUESTION:

Doesn't all of this add up to making some

sense of the idea that we have not applied the overbreadth
doctrine except in cases dealing with free speech generally as
a matter of standards?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

I think in this case that it must be

25

46

1

done in overbreadth, because that's what was done.

And the

2
questions that you've asked, first me and then Mr. Tinker, have
3

demonstrated how overbroad the statute is.

Remember,

4

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the Utah Supreme Court between the
5

the time this was argued to Judge Winder, who had before him
6
7
8
9

only the lower court decision in Bellotti, and the Utah Supreme
Court decision, this Court rendered its Bellotti II decision
and that case was argued by me twice to the Utah Supreme Court.
Because after this Court enunciated that decision, I filed a

10

motion with the Utah Supreme Court for an intermediate injunc­

11

tion enjoining the statute, and argued many of the points that

12

we've covered today.

They denied it, said they would defer it,

3

set us on an early calendar.

4

They had it, they knew about the problems of the mature minor,

5

but they didn't exempt the mature minor, they didn't, they knew

6

about the discussion in terms of best interest.

7
8
9

20
21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Tinker and I argued it again.

But you were free also to go to the Circuit

justice and ask for the same relief, were you not?
MR. DOLOWITZ:
that's true.

At that point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

But I had staring at me a 10th Circuit decision

saying that the trial court was correct in abstaining because
the statute was vague, because the Utah Supreme Court hadn't
said what that language "if possible" meant.

And I didn't have

a ruling until when the decision came out in March of this year.
It was at that time that we had a definition as to what the
47

1

statute was and instead of doing that, further cases were filed
2
3
4
5

in the Federal District Court because we finally had an inter­
pretation of what the language "if possible" meant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dolowitz, do you agree with Justice

Brennan that the answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question that

6

if 10 minutes before performing the abortion the doctor called

7

up the parents and said, I'm about to abort your daughter, I

8

want to give you notice in compliance with the statute.

9

does so and then aborts.

He

There would be no danger to inter­

10

ference with the -- I mean, it would be no violation of the

11

statute if he went ahead and there would be no terrible danger

12

that he could —

13

MR. DOLOWITZ:

I do agree with Mr. Tinker that that

14

would be compliance with the statute, which is what shows that

15

despite its —

16
17
18
19
20

QUESTION:

And if it's that easy to comply with it,

how can you seriously argue that it substantially burdens the,
a woman's private right to choose a decision?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Because if that, if the reason that he

did that is that he knew, for example, that the parents were
unbalanced and she risked physical injury when they found out,

21

that injury

risk is still waiting for her when she gets home,

22

if she gets home, or when she next meets her parents, if she's
23

afraid to go home.

They can still hurt her.

24

QUESTION:

So you'd say it would be equally

25

48

1

unconstitutional if there was a requirement that two hours after
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

an abortion is performed they notify the parents because they
might be unhappy about it?
MR. DOLOWITZ:

Yes.

It is still too overbroad.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 2:16 o'clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
