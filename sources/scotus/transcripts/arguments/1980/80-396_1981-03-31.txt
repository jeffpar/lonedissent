ORAL ARGUMENT OF GUY J. WELLS, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WELLS:

8

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
We are here this afternoon to decide whether muni­

9
10

cipal governments all across this nation are going to be sub­

1 1

jected to a new and potentially ruinous form of damage assess­

12

ment, a form of damage assessment that clearly was never con­

13

templated by the 42nd Congress.

14

strong policy purpose.

15

any of the remedial purposes of Section 1983.

It clearly is founded in no

And it wholly fails to accomplish

An award of punitive damages against a municipality

16
17

lacks either a historic or a societal justification.

say, is a municipality liable for punitive damages in a 1983

case?

me, will wreak havoc with the balance of governmental powers

22

in the United States without producing any significant corre­

23

sponding social purpose, even aside from the questions of

24

division of governmental powers, what logic or reason supports

25

a damage structure which punishes the innocent without

answer

Now, an

to the question presented -- that is to

-- an affirmative answer to that question, it seems to

3

1

deterring the guilty.
Now, going to the historic background of 1983, it

2
3

is perfectly clear that punitive damage awards against munici­

4

palities were wholly beyond the ken of the 42nd Congress.

5

Up until 1871 no court in this country, with one exception

6

-- and that exception was clearly remedied very shortly

7

thereafter -- no court of the United States had ever upheld

8

a punitive damage award against a municipality.

9

lawyer members of the 42nd Congress couldn't have helped but

10

know that.

1 1

at that time.

And the

There was a plethora of authority on that subject

As a matter of fact, none of the courts of England

12
13

had ever upheld a punitive damages award against a municipal­

14

ity.

15

Court has done in considering the question of compensatory

16

awards against municipalities, one only has to look at the

17

remarks of Congressman Kerr, Congressman Butler, and Con­

18

gressman Poland.

19

to debate on the Sherman Amendment, but we must remember that

20

the Sherman Amendment was aimed directly at municipalities,

21

the Sherman Act which passed the Senate and died in the

22

House.

23

of the impact of the Sherman Act indicated that it was in­

24

tended, and they believed it was intended, to be entirely

25

remedial.

If one wants to look at legislative history as this

Now, admittedly, those remarks were directed

And each of those gentlemen speaking to the question

I believe Representative Blair said, it is not
4

1

punitive or penal but remedial only.

2

can read that as representing the thinking of even some of the

3

most radical members of the 42nd Congress.

4

a punitive award would have been totally abhorrent.
QUESTION:

5

And I believe that one

I suggest that

You wouldn't suggest thrat punitive damages:

6

would have been improper in just the ordinary case.

7

just against the municipalities?
MR. WELLS:

8
9

It's

Well, I am limited here to talking

because of the -QUESTION:

10

Well, I know, but is your argument that

1 1

no punitive damages against municipalities because no punitive

12

damages against anyone?
MR. WELLS:

13

No, no, sir.

I am suggesting here that

14

I am talking only about punitive damages against municipali­

15

ties.

16

I recognize that this Court -QUESTION:

The legislative history you're citing

17

goes only to, or the case law that you're citing goes only

18

to municipalities?

19

MR. WELLS:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

It does, sir, yes.
And these Congressmen whose views you

have cited were proponents of the Sherman Amendment?
MR. WELLS:

I believe Representative Butler was.

23

I think perhaps

Representative Kerr was an opponent.

24

But it's interesting that they were in complete agreement witl

25

respect to the import of that Act.
5

And of course the Sherman

1

Act was a precursor of 1983.

Now, the reasons why I think

2

that a punitive award against the city was abhorrent to

3

Congress in 1871, the reasons for that are as compelling today

4

as they were then; even perhaps more compelling.

5

an award of punitive damages has an immeasurable impact upon

6

the financial structure of a city and today we have seen,

7

like, for instance, the examples of New York, Cleveland,

8

Boston; we know about them simply because they are matters of

9

national interest and we read about them all the time; but I

Obviously,

10

suggest that they are multiplied a thousandfold in smaller

1 1

municipalities throughout this country.

12

read the briefs, particularly of the Attorney General and

13

the briefs of the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers,

14

to understand the real menace

15

that is hanging over the heads of our cities and towns.

16

18

QUESTION:

And one only has to

or the real sword of Damocles

I suppose you'd make an exception of

those cities and towns that happen to like rock concerts?
MR. WELLS:

Well, you see, perhaps that is so.

If

19

they like them I guess they can take their chances.

20

case Newport attempted not to take its chances, but beyond

21

that the scope of 1983 is so broad and I'm sure this Court is

22

aware that today 1983 cases are multiplying like rabbits.

QUESTION:

In this

But you say that the issue is whether

punitive damages would ever be allowed against a municipality:
MR. WELLS:

That's true, sir.

there, nevertheless, no damages like that against a munici-

5

pality?

MR. WELLS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, I say that, sir.

And I say that --

And furthermore, Mr. Wells, I gather

8

you say that -- I guess you've settled that the 1983 liability

9

of

10

a

municipality requires the plaintiff to prove that it

is a matter of municipal policy?

MR. WELLS:

That's true, sir.

QUESTION:

13

MR. WELLS: True, but you see, again, in Rhode Island,

14

we will be drawing juries, any jury in our federal court comes

15

from every city and town in the state, so in a trial against

16

the City of Newport, for instance, the plaintiff would excuse,

17

and properly so, all residents of Newport.

18

residents of Providence, Warwick, East Providence, sitting in

19

a case to assess punitive damages against the City of Newport.

20

So the jury's interests are not necessarily identical with

21

the interests of the people of Newport.

22
23

QUESTION:

But they are taxpayers.

I didn't say identical.

So he might have

I said they were

of interest.

24

MR. WELLS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
That's all I said.
9

And all you should

1

have said was "yes," and you would have saved all of this

2

trouble.
QUESTION:

3

I took it that what you meant was, these

4

aren't taxpayers who are going to share in the burden of this

5

verdict?
MR. WELLS:

7

True.

And you see, you will have some

I have never known of a policy issued

in Rhode Island that covered punitive damages.

16

20

Is Rhode Island one of them?

Even in auto -In automobile cases they're excluded.
You mean that you can buy it for that?
Well, under the statutory policy in

Rhode Island, that's excluded. Punitive damages are excluded.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

So that you don't get

coverage for reckless -MR. WELLS:

No, sir.

Well, it would be an automo-

bile assault.
QUESTION:

Which would be uninsurable?
10

MR. WELLS:

1

That's right.

But, you see, further,

2

a number of people who are taxpayers may not have been tax­

3

payers in the city at the time the wrong was committed but

4

who moved to the city before the assessment of taxes was made.

5

Similarly, a number of taxpayers in the city at the time the

6

wrong was committed may have moved and escaped liability alto­

7

gether.

purpose.

So, again, I suggest that the imposition of punitive
a

municipality serves really no deterrent

I'd like to address myself to one of the things

10
11

that the trial judge said in passing on the motion for a new

12

trial and judgment N.O.V.

13

phrasing this, now -- the imposition of punitive damages on

14

the taxpayers of the city may have an influence, a beneficial

15

influence on the next election: they'll kick the rascals out.

He said, well -- and I'm para­

Now, I think that's an interesting

16

intrusion, if

17

that is what it is, of the federal court into local or munici­

18

pal affairs.

19

if we take a look at this case, the wrong, such as it was

20

-- and I suppose we're now beyond the point where I can argue

21

that it wasn't -- but the wrong occurred in August of 1975.

22

Since then we've had the '76 election, we've had the '78

23

election.

24

And, of course, the assessment of damages won't be made until

25

after a decision on the issue before us today is reached.

But, secondly, it doesn't make any sense.

Then we had the trial.

11

And

We've had the '80 election.

QUESTION:

1

2

Mr. Wells, Judge Pettine did grant a

remittitur of the punitive damages, didn't he?
MR. WELLS:

3

Yes, he did.

Yes, what he did in that

4

case, he decided -- the original award against the city was

5

$200,000, and against the individual councilmen in varying

6

amounts

7

I think correctly, if we are to have an award of punitive

8

damages that 1 the city could not be more guilty than the

9

councilmen who actually committed the act.

10

added up to $75,000.

What will happen

And Judge Pettine reasoned, anc

if we're talking about focusing

11

voter outrage on elected officials, the voter outrage

12

be focused, if assessment of taxes is what will do it, and I

13

suggest that that is the only thing that will do it, the voter

14

outrage won't be focused until the assessment which will be

15

by a council at

16

and they may not be the rascals

17

all.

18

be awarded as a deterrent because they'll focus attention on

19

the malefactors just doesn't make any sense in the light of

20

practicalities.

21

2

to object to the instruction; and do we just sweep that

3

under the rug, or what?

4

MR. WELLS:

5

QUESTION:

6

No, Your Honor.
We cannot because the respondent is

defending the judgment below on that ground.

7

8

And you failed

MR. WELLS:

Your Honor, I understand that and I had

seems to me, that cries out for the application of the plain

17

MR. WELLS:

18

QUESTION:

Well, yes, sir.
Well, Mr. Wells, let me ask you this, if

19

I may, along the lines of Justice White's question.

20

page A-15 of the petition for certiorari which is the last

21

paragraph of the court of appeals' appendix, where the court

22

of appeals says, "In short, the present state of the law

23

as to municipal liability is such that we cannot with confi­

24

dence predict its future course.

Where the law is in such a

contrary, we would be hard pressed to say that the trial "judge's

clear miscarriage of "justice."

Nor is this a case containing such a

Do you read that as a flat refusal to notice the

error?

I thought it was a little bit fuzzy myself, that the

8

court of appeals was not saying'

9

will not notice the error.
MR. WELLS:

10

Quite true.

in so many words that we

I think the court of

1 1

appeals was troubled, and I think it's interesting that the

12

court of appeals grappled with the problem when they could

13

have said, it's Rule 51 and we're not going to even listen to

14

you.

15

reading of Judge Pettine's opinion on the motion for a new

16

trial indicates that he was somewhat troubled.

again that the Court should relax the rule here for two real

reasons.

over the country.

QUESTION:

Of course, it may be that a good answer

23

to my question is, well, I rely on the grant of certiorari,

24

which is limited to one question.

25

MR. WELLS:

Well, yes, that's correct, Your Honor.
14

1

This Court is going to end up here sooner or later and pro­

2

bably, considering the volume of cases, it's from the point

of view of iudicial efficiency, and from the point of view of

4

municipal stability, it might be better to have the question

answered as quickly as possible.

10

a question to be presented on this petition, but it’s a ques­

1 1

tion that needs answering sooner or later so let's answer"it

12

now.

13

MR, WELLS:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think

14

this is a little different because of the volume of cases in

15

which the punitive damages issue is a real Issue,

16

secondly, because I suppose with the exception of people who

17

live on Indian reservations, for instance, or federal en­

18

claves, every American lives in a city or town, and I doubt

19

that there are many cities or towns in the United States who

20

are not presently having some forms of financial problems,

21

and to settle an Issue of this kind early, I think, perhaps

22

stabilizes their relationships with the Government, it gives

23

them an opportunity to assess the kinds of things that they

24

are going to do.

25

QUESTION:

And,

Well, when you say, we ought to "relax"
15

1

the rule as to noticing plain error, are you saving that we

2

should review the court of appeals-'- refusal to note plain

3

error, or that in effect the court of appeals did regard this

4

as plain error and, as you say, grappled with it in an entire

5

paragraph rather than just brushing it off and saying, it

6

wasn't raised?
MR. WELLS:

7

I think the court of appeals really be­

8

lieved it was plain error, and that that's why you find that

9

language you referred to as kind of fuzzy language, in what

10

is apparently close to the last paragraph.
QUESTION:

11

Of course, you could say, you could ask

12

us to waive our own rule against considering questions not

13

raised below but presented here.

14

MR. WELLS:

15

QUESTION:

Well, the question was raised below.
May I ask a question about the judgments

16

related to this?

The trial judge reduced the punitive damage

17

award against the city from $200,000 to $75,000, as I remember

18

it.

19

other defendants?

And was there not also a punitive damage award against

20

MR. WELLS:

21

QUESTION:

22

Yes, there were.
For how much, and is that a joint and

several liability, or a separate judgment?
MR. WELLS:

23

No, no.

There were five councilmen, anc

24

a mayor.

And there were varying awards of punitive damages

25

against them which totaled $75,000.
16

I believe there were two

1

of $40,000 and a couple of ten and a couple of five, some-

2

thing --

QUESTION:

Well, now, were those -- if they col­

lected those, that 75 from the individuals, could they get thi s

10

75 from the city in addition?

1 1

MR. WELLS:

Absolutely, and that's the interesting

12

thing about punitive damages, because, for instance, there was

13

a $72,000 compensatory damage award against the councilmen

14

and against the city.

15

the $72,000 satisfies the entire compensatory damage award.

16

But the punitive damage awards are all cumulative, and again,

17

this is one of the problems.

18

you can collect compensatory damages.

But the punitive damages as to him repre­

Precisely, but -Well, it's another form of exemplary, to

MR. WELLS

That's true.

And the problem is, or

23

it seems to me that the answer is, that -- while I know that

24

this Court has never precisely passed on punitive damages in

25

1983 cases, they're being assessed against individuals as they

1

were in this case, all the time.

2

instance, as against the councilmen in this case, you are

3

making an example of them as actors, but in assessing it

4

against a municipality you're really not making an example of

5

anybody but the poor taxpayer.

thing else, that militates against this.

MR. WELLS:

No, Your Honor, they were not.

Again,

I say, historically, there's no reason for anyone to suspect

that the Congress intended punitive damages against a muni­

really punishes the innocent rather than the guilty actors.

12

There are remedies against the actors that are imposing;

there are criminal sanctions in the appropriate case; there

are injunctive relief; there are punitive damages awarded

guage in Carey v. Piphus at 256 of 435, where it says that,

1 1

"to the extent that Congress intended that awards under Sec­

12

tion 1983 should deter the deprivation of constitutional

13

rights, there is no evidence that it meant to establish a

14

deterrent more formidable than that inherent in the award of

15

compensatory damages?"

16

MR. DECOF:

What I say to that is that Carey v.

think I paraphrase correctly -- this is not to say that we

in this very case, for example?

I suppose it's possible the

jury could have found the municipality liable as having a

16

individual councilmen would have had an Immunity defense,

17

that the municipality acted maliciously.

25

up the example, for example, of the statute which is
32

Your Honor points

one reason why we need punitive damages against a munici­

So there's a tremendous gap that punitive

I don't think I referred to them, I

I urge the Court that the government is of the people and

14

the government is the people, and we're not just concerned

15

with the people of the City of Newport or the State of Rhode

QUESTION: Mr. Decof, may I ask you a question about

this indemnification?

15

does it have the authority to indemnify council members whom

you say maliciously violated the Constitution of the United

17

States ?

MR. DECOF:

In your opinion, is a city permitted,

And you didn't consider the power and

QUESTION:

it would have been extremely hard to

May I ask this, then.

If cities may

indemnify councilmen who deliberately violate the Constitu­

10

tion for any punitive damages assessed against them, what

1 1

deterrence is there in granting punitive judgments even

12

against the individuals?

13

MR. DECOF:

14

cities don't always.

15

have committed these acts, by the time the case goes to court,

16

someone else is in office and they don't control the council

17

and maybe then the city wouldn't vote to indemnify.

18

from my standpoint, the most important deterrent is the

19

deterrent that goes against the city

20

city is there, it's permanent, it has some control over its

21

policies, it can do something about these things.

22

that these things are not done again.

damages hadn't deterred them in the past, and maybe the only

13

thing that would deter them would be the threat of punitive

But, again, stopping them, an injunction hadn't

This is not plain error,
This is not plain error;

to the instruction; period.
MR. DECOF:

Well, I don't know, Your Honor, but I

20

cannot agree with Mr. Wells' interpretation that they felt it

21

was plain error because the exact language was, "where the lav

22

is in such a state of flux and there is no appellate decision

23

to the contrary, we would be hard pressed to say that the

24

trial judge's punitive damage instruction was plain error."

Even if error?

Even if error?

MR. DECOF:

MR. DECOF:

No, they didn’t say, "even if error."
It’s implicit, isn't it?
I think they're saying, Your Honor, that

5

we can say this is plain error because there are no cases to

QUESTION:
