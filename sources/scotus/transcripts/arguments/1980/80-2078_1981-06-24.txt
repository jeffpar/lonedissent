ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOWARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I've asked the Marshal to divide my time to 40 minutes
opening and 20 minutes rebuttal.
We are here to review two orders of a federal district
court denying a motion for a preliminary injunction in granting
a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief.
We are here on an uncontested factual record.

The Government

did not put in any factual opposition or evidence and by its
motion under Rule 12(b)(6) conceded the facts as pled.

16

The suit below relates to an earlier lawsuit that was
17

filed by the Petitioner, Dames £ Moore, against the State of
18

Iran, an agency of the government called the Atomic Energy Orga­
19

nization of Iran and several Iranian banks that I will refer to as
20

the bank defendants.

In that lawsuit the facts of which are pled

21

in the complaint below, the Petitioner obtained attachment or­
22

ders from the United States -district court.

Those attachment

23

orders were served on third parties and property of various of
24
25

the bank defendants was thereby attached as security for any -3

QUESTION:

What was the basis of the federal district

2

court jurisdiction, Mr. Howard?

3

MR. HOWARD:

The federal district court jurisdiction

4

was premised on 28 USC Section 1330, and the provisions of the

5

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, in particular Section 1605, the

6

section that deals’ with /whether or not certain states are immune

7

from suit and sets out the grounds therein.

8

vides that if a state is not immune from suit and is otherwise

9

served in accordance with the provisions of those sections, that

10

personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction are auto­

11

matically conveyed upon the federal district court.
QUESTION:

12
13

16
17
18

So that it is not based upon diversity of

citizenship?
MR. HOWARD:

14
15

Section 1330 pro­

It was not.

The diversity section was

alleged in the jurisdictional allep'=,j ion in that complaint and,
frankly, it's a mistake.

But the appropriate section was also

alleged and that is the only section on which we claimed juris­
diction in that lawsuit.
QUESTION:

19

Mr. Howard, your lawsuit was not commenced

until after the seizure of the hostages by Iran, was it?
20

MR. HOWARD:

That is correct, that is correct.

There

21

were some negotiations between the parties prior to that event
22

and those negotiations were not successful.

They occurred in

23

about

September

and

October,

if

I

recall

correctly.

24
25

The hostages were seized in early November and the lawsuit was
4
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

filed in mid-December.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HOWARD:

Was that after the blocking order?
It was after the blocking order; yes.

4

In that lawsuit, in February of 1981, after extensive litiga­

5

tion below the Petitioner obtained a separate judgment against

6

two of the defendants, the State of Iran, and the Atomic Energy

7

Organization, and separate judgment was entered pursuant to

8

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).

9

with respect to the bank defendants.

The lawsuit went on
The Petitioner commenced

10

efforts to levy on its judgment on certain Iranian property in

11

the State of Washington.

12

when Petitioner filed the lawsuit that is now before the Court.
That lawsuit was filed in reaction to the Algerian

13
14
15
16

Declarations, which the Court would be familiar with, and the
executive orders that were promulgated to enforce, carry out
those Declarations.
In the Declarations, which were entered into on

17
18
19

And the case stood in that posture

January 19, 1981, the President agreed -- and I would stress,
the President, with no participation by the Congress -- we're
not talking about a treaty, we're not talking about an act of

20

Congress.

The President agreed to terminate all litigation in

21

the United States pending against Iran.

He agreed to nullify

22
all judgments and all attachments against the Iranians.

He

23

agreed to set up an international tribunal which would, if the
24
25

agreement was carried out, have some security for judgments that
5
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

it might render.

2

It would have a billion dollars.

Beyond that, and whether that tribunal will In fact

3

be set up and operate and how long it will take and how certain

4

its results will be, none of us know.

5

clusion for its jurisdiction, for claims with certain forum

6

selection clauses favoring Iran, and I have set forth in our

7

briefs the text of that exclusionary clause and also the text

8

of the forum selection clause that appears in the contract of

9

Petitioner.

The tribunal has an ex­

It is our position that Petitioner’s chances of pro­

10

11

ceeding in that tribunal are problematic.

12

the Government or Petitioner can establish with absolute cer­

13

tainty how that tribunal would rule, but I think that we can

14

bring to bear our own analysis on those two provisions and con­

15

clude at a minimum that things do not look entirely bright for

16

the Petitioner in that tribunal.
QUESTION:

17
18
19
20

I don't think either

Is that the one that the Government has

said it would urge, and urge the American petitioners before the
tribunal to urge that there has been such a change of affairs
that -MR. HOWARD:

As I understand the Government's position,

21

in its way, in its brief, it's very careful, I notice, on this. It
22

says that the clauses may not be binding; the word in the
23

Government's brief is, may not be binding, because of changed
24
25

circumstances, and that the Government is urging the individual
6
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

companies to take the position those are not binding clauses.

2

Now, it is not at all clear that the tribunal will agree with that

3

and I must say, it is not at all clear to me, reading the text,

4

whether the text of the

5

argument availing, because it talks about binding contracts with

6

clauses providing such and such.

7

with binding clauses," and I can't tell even whether the word

8

"binding" modifies the word "contract" or modifies the word

9

"clause."

Algerian. Declarations even makes that

It doesn't say, "contracts

So, in any event, this is a tribunal that is going

10

to be one-third Iranian, one-third U.S., and one-third presuma­

11

bly some kind of neutral representatives, assuming the tribunal

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

operates at all.

And we simply have no way of predicting whe­

ther or not we'll be able to have our claim in that court.
QUESTION:

And who picks the neutral members, the

so-called neutral members?
MR. HOWARD:

As I understand it, they have to be mu­

tually selected.
QUESTION:
MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION:

By the other members of the court?
By the two adversary -Haven't they been selected?

20

MR. HOWARD:

The Government's brief advises, us --

21

none of this is in the record, but the Government's brief states
22

that three arbitrators have been picked.

I have no independent

23

knowledge of that one way or the other.
24

QUESTION:
25

Three United States arbitrators?
7
North American Reporting

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

MR. HOWARD:

2

Government's brief.

3

QUESTION:

4

And three neutrals, according to the

But the other six haven't been picked, have

they?

5

MR. HOWARD:

Again according to the Government's brief,

6

the Iranians have named their three, the United States have

7

named their three, and the other three have been selected al­

8

though nothing has happened yet.

9

ing to the Government's brief, again -- have a meeting shortly

They are going to -- accord­

10

for organizational purposes.

11

months from the agreement and the so-called settlements that

12

were supposed to take place before the tribunal have not taken

13

place at all, to my knowledge.
Now, as I indicated, it's very unclear whether

14
15

Petitioner can go to this tribunal or not.
QUESTION:

16
17
18
19

In the meantime we're almost six

Is there any suggestion that we have to

decide whether they can or cannot -- whether you can or cannot
go?
MR. HOWARD:

No, I don't think that's a question

that -- first of all, the Court couldn't dispositively resolve
20
that in any event.

As I understand it, that would be a ques­

21

tion for the tribunal to resolve its own jurisdiction.

I simply

22
present the Petitioner's case to you as one in which it is
23

hardly clear that we have any alternative remedy, although it is
24
25

also my position that even if we have clear access to that
8
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

tribunal that the President is without power, acting alone, to

2

take us out of the United States district court where the Con­

3

gress put us and make us go there.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Howard,

Now, the executive orders -before you leave the forum

5

selection clause, has the district court in this case decided

6

the effect of that clause on federal jurisdiction yet?

7

MR. HOWARD:

No.

The United States in its initial

8

suggestions of interest that were filed in these cases in

9

February stated that the courts should require the Iranians to

10

take a position in the individual case as to whether or not it

11

belonged in the tribunal or in the district court.

12

for example, Iran agreed that you couldn't go there, then the

13

case could proceed, according to this early statement of

14

interest.

15
16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

And if,

Was that perfectly clear, or does Iran

possibly take the position that the clause means what it says?
MR. HOWARD:

I am confident Iran takes the position

that the clause means what it says.
QUESTION:

But has the district court passed on that

contention of Iran?
20

MR. HOWARD:

No.

The Iranians in our case and to my

21

knowledge in all cases have steadfastly refused to accept the
22

invitation that they take a position.

I believe — you can ask

23

Mr. Shack, but I believe their position is that they have no
24
25

requirement to take a position in district court.

North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

There are the

1

accords, the President has purported to suspend all:claims that

2

may possibly go to the tribunal, and that's the end of it, for

3

the district court.

4

QUESTION:

5

No, I'm not sure I made my question clear.

Putting to one side for a moment the tribunal --

6

MR. HOWARD:

7

QUESTION:

Right.
They might argue that instead of -- say

8

there was no tribunal, would they agree that they'd have to

9

litigate in

10

11

a

United States court as opposed to an Iranian

court?
MR. HOWARD:

Oh, no.

I'm sure that the Iranians would

12

take the position that the forum selection clause in our con­

13

tract is enforceable.

14

changed circumstances it is our position that --

15

QUESTION:

We take the position that because of

And the federal district court has not

decided one way or the other on it?.
MR. HOWARD:

Did not decide that question, although

that particular question was not contested in the hearing that
took place on our judgment.
QUESTION:

But, in any event, Mr. Howard, the form of

20

your clause requires preliminary conciliation or arbitration
21
by the three-member group?
22

MR. HOWARD:

In Iran.

23

QUESTION:

Before the clause, at least, requires you

24

to go to the courts of Iran?
25

IQ
North American Heportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

MR. HOWARD:

That is correct.

And the United States

2

takes the position, as I understand, that because there is a

3

prelitigation step, admittedly, in Iran and with the third

4

arbitrator chosen by the Iranian Government, that therefore we

5

are not committed to the sole jurisdiction of Iranian courts.

6

Now, that's an imaginative interpretation and I sup­

7

pose if my client loses this case I may be someday trying to

8

make that argument myself, but I'm not entirely confident that

9

I'm going to succeed.

10

The Executive has now implemented these accords by

11

in fact promulgating a series of executive orders, and those

12

executive orders purport to nullify all attachments and to order

13

the property that is secured by those attachments -- and proper­

14

ty that's not secured by attachments — back to Iran under the

15
16
17
18
19

pain of criminal penalties.

The Executive has not simply

unfrozen the property,’ to let it be in the marketplace and to
be moved by the Iranians or attached, as the litigation process
may determine, but rather the Executive has ordered the property
out of the country and has set criminal penalties for anyone
who does not cooperate with that.

20

In a later executive order the Executive has suspended
21

-- that's the word of the order -- all claims in the United
22

States now against Iran, and indicated that -- unless it's
23

absolutely clear that they can't go to the tribunal and given
24
25

the United States's interpretation,
11

no

claim' is

North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

absolutely,

1

is it absolutely clear

2

in effect, all claims against the Iranians have been suspended.

3

QUESTION:

it can't go to the tribunal.

So that,

Do you regard the later executive order

4

signed by President Reagan as going further than the executive

5

order signed by President Carter?
MR. HOWARD:

6

In logic I think the answer to that is

7

yes, because one of the issues before the Court is whether or

8

not the Executive has the unfettered discretion to settle in

9

his own whim, or for good reason, as he sees it, the claims of

10

Americans against foreign states.

11

Executive has that power -- and obviously I want to address

12

It seems to me that if the

that -- if the Executive has that power to settle a claim, I

13

suppose he can also give away the security.

14

the order by President Reagan might be regarded as going fur­

15
16
17
18

ther.

So, in that sense,

I think it goes -- it certainly goes further in terms

of infringements on court processes, although you get there
only, I think, by an analytic process.

All that it purports to

do by itself is suspend the filing.
Now, the effect of these orders together on the

19

Petitioner and its case is frankly devastating.

We had a judg­

20

ment against two parties we were in the process of trying to
21

levy, we had a lawsuit going on against the rest of the parties
22

with attachments; it's all wiped out.

Our judgment is nulli­

23

fied, our judgment levies are nullified, our attachments are
24
25

nullified, we can't even keep suing the parties who were still
12
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

before the district court, and our only alternative is to go

2

to The Hague with the time and expense that's involved there

3

and quite possibly be told that we're not entitled to present

4

our claim there, and even if we are they only have a small

5

fraction of the money that's necessary to pay off the claims.

6

For that reason, we filed an action below seeking

7

injunctive and declaratory relief against the Secretary of the

8

Treasury, and as indicated in the briefs the Government filed

9

a cross-motion under 12(b)(6) to dismiss, our motion was

10

denied, and the Government's motion was granted, and the dis­

11

trict court has indicated in its memorandum that he did reach

12

the merits, if you will, of these constitutional issues pre­

13

sented, because he indicated that he ruled on the basis of the

14

arguments made by the Government.

QUESTION:

Do you think the district court ruled on

We presented that argument to the

It is hard for me to know what-all thoughts

20

went through his mind; we certainly argued the taking in our
21

memorandum.

The Government only fleetingly addressed it, as I

22

recall, in its papers.

The argument certainly has been rejected

23

by the district court.
24

QUESTION:
25

Incidentally, Mr. Howard, your attachments
*
13
North American Reporting

were obtained based on licenses that you secured under the
regulations ?

3

MR. HOWARD:

Well, we didn't actually go secure them

4

in the sense of making an application.

5

through the Secretary of the Treasury, promulgated a series of

6

regulations in which he said, judicial proceedings are autho­

7

rized.

8

for judicial proceedings includes attachments.

9

proceed to attach with those regulations in effect, although

10

it is our position that under the case of Zittman v. McGrath

11

the Executive do not have the power to prevent those attach­

12

ments , so why --

And then a subsequent regulation says, the authorization

MR. HOWARD:

And so we did

So you could have got them without -That's right.

So long as they didn't

interfere with his freezing program.

So long as they didn't

interfere with his freezing program we could get them anyway.
Now -QUESTION:

18
19

The Executive, I think

Then you don't think, this is a part of

your legal argument, I'm

sure, you don't think Zittman was

overruled or limited by Orvis?
20

MR. HOWARD:

No, I think Orvis deals with a different

21

question.
22

QUESTION:

Yes, well, you can wait; I guess you can

23

wait on that.
24

QUESTION:
25

Well, both of them deal with the TWEA,
14
North American Reporting

1

2

don't they, which was in effect repealed by the IEEPA?
MR. HOWARD:

Well, they both deal with the Trading

3

With the Enemy Act in situations in which the

4

Custodian exercised his power to vest, a power the President

5

does not have --

6

QUESTION:

MR. HOWARD:

9

the property.

Under the IEEPA?
-- under the International Emergency

In both cases, the Alien Property Custodian vested
In one case he purported to vest only whatever

10

the enemy had and the other, in the Orvis case

11

it's called a res vesting; he took it.

12

Alien Property

he vested --

And the Court in Orvis -- first in Zittman, they said,

13

the attachment is good as between debtor and creditor, as long

14

as it doesn't interfere with the freeze program that the Presi­

15
16
17
18
19

dent is trying to carry out.

But in Orvis he did a res vesting

and the Court said, when the Alien Property Custodian takes the
property, when he seizes it and vests it under a power he
doesn't have now, he takes free of the attachment.

And so the

creditor in Orvis was not secured, not able to get his property
back under Section 9 of that Act, but became an unsecured credi­

20
tor under Section 34 of that Act, none of which protections do
21
we have in this case.
22

QUESTION: I'll' wait until the legal part of your argument.
23

MR. HOWARD:

I at least understand, Mr. Justice

White, where you want me to address my argument.

QUESTION:

That's all right; .go'ahead. \

MR. HOWARD:

Never before in American history has a

President, acting alone without Congress, without two-thirds of
the Senate, attempted to do what the President of the United
States has attempted to do in this case.

Never has a President

6

acting alone taken claims pending before United States district

7

courts, validly and enforceably there under congressional

8

statute, and taken them out of those courts and put them in an

9

international tribunal.

Never.

Never before has a President

10

acting alone or acting under any statutory authority that now

11

exists, or acting under the Trading with the Enemy Act, even in

12

its older form, never has a President acting alone attempted to

13

transfer out of the country valuable assets of a foreign coun­

14

try that serve as potential security for the claims of American

15

citizens, leaving them unpaid and without any practical remedy.

16

QUESTION:

to a statute, he's hardly acting alone, is he?

MR. HOWARD:

Well, if the President is acting pursuant

MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION:

I agree with you completely.
But you say that even under —
Just historically.
Even with or without congressional agree­

ment, you say this has never happened?
MR. HOWARD:
QUESTION:

He's never done it.

Never happened.

How about with the aid of a treaty?

24

MR. HOWARD:
25

With the aid of a treaty at least we

have similar'cases to the present case.

QUESTION:

MR. HOWARD:

4

6

It has happened, hasn't it?

QUESTION:

Certainly.
And the Schooner, how about the Schooner

Peggy?
MR. HOWARD:

Exactly.

That is a treaty case.

And

7

then, let me quite clear about this.

8

the political departments of the Government acting together

9

could not do everything that has been done.

We do not contend that

They could,

10

although they would have to pay for the taking.

11

do everything that's been done.

12

President can do it, acting alone, without two-thirds of the

Now, why do you think the IEEPA

does not authorize the President to relieve foreign property

from the burdens of attachment?

4

MR. HOWARD:

Because it is the same words that are in

the Trading with the Enemy Act that are construed by the Court

6

in Zittman, and the Court in Zittman says that if the attach­

ment doesn't require a transfer of ownership or possession and

course, he can regulate or prohibit it.

against foreign states.
So that, before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act, there was no practical way to really sue a foreign state
in this country.

And naturally, what happened is, individuals

went to the Government and said, please help us, we have been
hurt, our property has been expropriated, or they breached
this contract, or whatever the claims were.

And the Executive,

in service to the American citizens, has tried to settle many
19

of those claims and to be sure, occasionally a citizen has been
20

unhappy with the result that the Executive may have obtained.
21

But the history is of using diplomacy to aid the private citi­
22
zen, not to sacrifice the rights of the citizen to aid a diplo­
23

matic goal.

It's totally turned around here.

24

The Foreign Sovereign

14

and there the Secretary made a suggestion of immunity, and
the Chief Justice says, "When the Secretary elects, as he may,
and he appears to have done in this case" -- and I might say,
there's nothing in the record other than his assertion of sove­
reign immunity -- "when he elects to settle claims against the
vessel by diplomatic negotiations between the two countries
rather than by continued litigation in the courts, it is of

20

public importance that the action of the political arm of the
21

Government taken within its appropriate sphere be promptly

recognized."
23

Now, the point is that the Chief Justice recognizes

the argument that IEEPA prohibits -- I have to pick out the

5

magic words -- prohibits a citizen from exercising a right with

Now, I guess I'd want to say two things to that. First

And he said, I think filing a

Of all, the traditional'Government' argument has been that some­

10

how the President could freeze the claim, the claim of the

11

United States citizen.

12

That doesn't work out very well because

it's pretty hard to say that the claim of the U.S. citizen

13

against Iran is property in which the Iranians have an interest.

14

So that one doesn't work.
But this other one, that Judge Breyer went for, I

16
17
18
19

think, is equally unavailing because a lawsuit isn't the exer­
cising of a right with respect to property.

If you get a judg­

ment and you go out and try to get some property, then you're
exercising a right with respect to property.

But we do not

deny that the Executive, as long as the emergency continues,

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS

1

MR. LEE:

2

Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:

There is every indication that if you look at the

3

situation just from the standpoint of the claimants themselves

4

in this case, the entire body of American claimants taken as a

5

whole, that their situation today is much better than it was

6

prior to the November 14, 1979, order before the Government ever

7

entered this picture.
On the one hand the problems that the claimants faced

8
9

absent any kind of action by the Government included these.

10

There were serious problems in most of the cases with respect

11

to jurisdiction.

12

sovereign immunity and active state defenses, and with regard

13

to the attachment or the property that might be available for

14

the levy of execution following judgments, if any were ever

15

entered, the November, 1979, order was made in response to re­

16
17

ports that the Government of Iran was about to withdraw its
funds.
Now, contrast that with the circumstances that exist

18
19

Jin many of the : cases there were also both

because of the acts that were taken

by: the

President,

his

January 19 orders and the subsequent order of President Reagan
20

on February 24.

In the first place, all problems of jurisdic­

21

tion, sovereign immunity, and act of state have been stripped
22

away.

In addition, there is a settlement account in the amount

23

of $1 billion that is established, and the Government of Iran
24
25

has guaranteed to pay all of the claims, both expropriation and

Well, those traditional forces didn't seem

to prevail in the seizure of the hostages themsdlves, did they?
MR. LEE:

14

There is another available remedy because

15

of this settlement, Justice Stewart, that was also not available

16

prior to the agreement itself, and that is that any of the

conform with its international obligations.

more doubts you have.

MR. LEE:

Yes, and yet, Justice Rehnquist, I think

conform to its obligaitions.

We're not dealing here with an assumption.

countries of the world is rather high.

MR. LEE:

From the rest of the world, and it would be

paying a very high price if it did that, of course.

23

MR. LEE:

Well, all I'm saying is, Justice Stevens,

24
25

that while it is true, as this Court said in United States v.
36
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

2

broader use than just the assurance of the rights of American

claimants.

will, this is part of a leverage that the President can and

should use in achieving the normalization of relations with

6

foreign countries.

MR. LEE:

Well, but so far in your argument, you're

just telling us what a good deal it was.
MR. LEE:

17

That is correct.

Well, all I am saying is, Justice Stewart,

that the proposition that this was used solely as a bargaining
chip for the release of the hostages does not tell the entire
story.

MR. LEE:

This was solely a matter of flushing out

5

and that is these forum clauses.

6

Let me come, then, to the legal issue.

Or, let

Even there the claimants are considerably better off

7

because of the fact that with the agreement they do have an

8

additional argument that was not available to them initially

9

flowing from the combination of Article V, which refers to,

10

specifically, to changed circumstances, and Article II, which

11

talks about the fact that It must be a binding contract which

12

in turn can tie back to Article V.

13

Turning then to the law.

In our view, there Is a

14

single issue that undergirds both of the questions, that is,

15

both +'he question of power to nullify attachments and transfer

16

assets, and also the power to settle claims.

17

the power of the President to act in an international crisis

And it concerns

whose nature and magnitude are such that if it to be resolved
it has to be resolved by one person and one person alone, and
under our system of argument that person is the President.

MR. LEE:

6

The Government's position on compensation

is this, Justice Rehnquist, that the Petitioner's claims for
compensation are premature at this time.

The reason that

they're premature is that no one knows whether they have suf­
fered any damage or not because we don't know and we cannot know
that unless and until the tribunal has completed its work.

7

QUESTION:

So the Government doesn't concede they

8

would have any remedy under the Just Compensation Clause of the

9

Fifth Amendment if in fact they do suffer loss?

10

MR. LEE:

Well, I find it difficult to take the posi­

11

tion that the exception that Judge Duffy found in the Tucker

12

Act jurisdiction under the treaty exception could be applicable.

13

And the reason is that under this Court's decision in Hughes

14

apart from the subject treaty."

That is a question, of course, for another

MR. LEE:

You don't have a position on that yet?
No, I certainly do not.

We think that the

right position is that it is consistent with the general
objective.

That matter of terminating the claims was a state­

8

ment that was made at the beginning, a broad statement of

9

purpose, and our position would be that the suspension, await­

10

ing the outcome of the determination by the tribunal, is

11

generally consistent with that -- .

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lee, I take it then the Govern­

13

ment position is that we certainly shouldn't decide in this

14

case or in any other one that the tribunal does not have juris­

15

diction?

16

MR. LEE:

17

QUESTION:

Of course not.

And I --

Well, I don't know, that's not so clear.

18

The argument's pretty strong, at least in some of the cases

19

pending around, that the treaty would exclude some of these

20

21
22
23
24

claims.

It seems to be, looks clear, and — but if the tribunal

does not have jurisdiction and the claimant is remitted to
the courts and he gets a judgment, what the treaty has done,
since the United States promised to end all suits, in the in­
stance I am posing, that suit wouldn't be over.

If there was a

judgment, however, it would not be enforceable anywhere else

Either as to the attachments or the claim

And briefly, the reason is this.

As to the

So there's no property --

it turns on this matter that we've just been talking about.
45
North American Reporting

1

All that the President has done is to suspend those claims.

2

Part of them, the tribunal will determine that it has no juris­

3

diction.

4

can come back into court.

5

those attachments also owed their life to the license.

6

As to those, there has been no taking because they
Sans attachment, to be sure, but

Now, with regard to the others, where the tribunal

7

either determines that to make an award or not to make an

8

award, then the only way that you could say that there has been

9

a taking is to say that by settlement of a dispute through

10

another alternative means of dispute resolution is a taking.

11

And particularly in today's world, with all the attention that

12

is being given to the matter of alternative means of dispute

13

resolution, it would be very unfortunate for this Court to

14

enter a judgment that settlement through alternative means of

15

dispute resolution raise Article III problems.
QUESTION:

16

18
19

How do you distinguish your answer to

Justice Brennan from the decision in the railroad reorganization
cases?
MR. LEE:

Well, it may be -- those of course are --

the difference there is differences in degree.

And it's a

20

question of imminence and the Court may well want to say.
21

The way I distinguish it is, that we simply cover the water­
22
front, in my view, with all of the actions that the President
23

did and that there is a solid basis for this Court to say that
24
25

under no circumstance can there be a taking, because you have
46
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

both the attachments covered by the license point and you also

2

have the claim settlement authority covered by the fact of the

3

suspension.

4

QUESTION:

Well, at least, Mr. Lee, it seems to me

5

your very assertion that the taking question is premature with

6

respect to the claims is an assertion that as of right now

7

there has been no taking.

8

don't you?
MR. LEE:

9
10

11
12
13
14
15

You have to at least say that,

Yes, as of right now, there certainly

has not been a taking.

Now, to finish it on out, what you

could not do today is to say that there has been a taking.
I think you can today say there has not.

What you could not

do today is to say that there has, and that would bring you
to the question that everyone wants me to answer and that I
think I have answered, and that is, in that event is there a
remedy?

And the answer to that is, it seems to me, as I read

16

that treaty exception to the Tucker Act, that there is.
17

QUESTION:

That's the United States position, not

18

just Mr. Lee's, I take it?
19

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

Now coming to the ques­

20

tion oil the authority of the President to transfer the assets
21

and nullify the attachments, it is agreed on all sides that that
22

is covered by the IEEPA, and I think little more need be said
23

by that.

That puts it in Category One of Justice Jackson's

24

three categories.
25

I understand Mr. Howard's statement that it
47
North American Reporting

GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

is very broad language, but I think that relates only to the

2

taking question, which I've already covered, and does not per­

3

tain to the President's power.

4

Moreover, coming out of this Court's declarations in

5

United States v. Pink and the Curtiss-Wright case, there is

6

certainly a great deference in these matters of delegations of

7

broad authority to the President.

8

itself, it says that this power will be exercised only with

9

respect to an unusual and extraordinary threat which amounts to

10

a national emergency.
Let me come then to what I regard as the hardest

11
12

13
14
15

And indeed, in the IEEPA

problem in the case, and that is, this power of the President
to settle outstanding claims.

There is no question that this

aspect of the case does not fit as neatly within any identifi­
able congressional statute as does the first powers.

We think,

And that is the argument against using

3

this statute in this instance.

4

that if there is a defect in that respect, it is a defect

5

essentially with Congress, particularly when you take into

6

account what this Court said in Curtiss-Wright and United

7

States v. Pink about the way you approach the congressional

8

authorizations in the area of foreign affairs.

9
10

11
12
13
14

But if there is no question

But let me go on, now, to what I think is an even
more significant point in this respect.

And that is, that

even if you can't fit it within -- even if you were to decide
that the Hostage Act does not apply, Justice Jackson in the
guidelines that he gave indicated that you get the additional
force of Article I power added to Article II power when you
have the implied approval of Congress.

This simply is not an

15

area in which the interbranch relationships between Congress
16

and the President have been characterized by contention and by
17

interbranch struggle.

Rather, it has been an area in which

18

there has been a continuing recognition by Congress of the
19

existence of claims settlement authority and periodic enactments
20

to support it.
21

For example, at the time that the IEEPA was enacted,
22
the Congress observed that one of the reasons that it authorized
23

blocking orders was that they are "generally the most effective
24

means of achieving settlement of United States claims."
25

50
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

And in

1

addition, in. such enactments as the International Claims Settle­

2

ment Act and the work of.the Foreign Claims Settlement Gommissior

3

and the periodic reenactment by Congress reflecting the work

4

of that Commission, in the reports that are made to Congress

5

under the IEEPA, and generally just across the boards, this

6

has been an area in which the Legislative Branch has recognized

7

the existence of claims settlement authority and has periodi­

8

cally acted to implement and to support it.
QUESTION:

9
10

11
12
13

15

Now, the --

Well, Mr. Lee, let me quote to you, if I

may, Article V of the China Settlement Agreement, signed by
Secretary Kreps and her corresponding Chinese official, which
is heavily relied on in the Government because it's a 1979
document..

And it says, "After the date of the signature of

this agreement neither Government will present to the other on
its behalf or on behalf of another any claim encompassed by
this agreement.

If any such claim is presented directly by a

16

national of one country to the Government of another, that
17

Government will refer it to the Government of the national who
18

presented the claim."
19

Now, that doesn't strike me as ousting the United
20
States courts of jurisdiction of a claim.
21

MR. LEE:

I agree.

22
QUESTION:

So, does that, support your claims -- ?

23

MR. LEE:

Oh, no.

It does not get us to the Article

24

III question.
25

All it gets' us to is'the fact'that'the claims

51
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

settlement authority does exist, that it is an authority that

2

is of longstanding recognition and practice, and that it is one

3

that has long been recognized by Congress.

4

to the Article III question in just a moment.

5

I intend to come

I just would like to -- well, I'd like to say before

6

I get there, that in addition to congressional recognition this

7

is an authority that in the language of the

8

9

established international practice reflecting traditional

international theory."
But this Court

11
12

Court

in United States v. Pink characterized

it as a modest implied power of the President

as

to

-which

effectiveness in handling the delicate problems of foreign rela­
tions requires no less.

And finally, it is a practice so well

established that it is reflected as black-letter law in Section
213

of the Second Restatement of the Foreign'Relations Law

of the United States.

So we're not dealing here with something

that is just a newcomer in this particular case, and the propo­
18

sition -19

QUESTION:

We aren't governed by the Restatement

20

though, are we?
21

MR. LEE:

No, no, of course not.

But all I'm saying

22

is that it is a practice that is well recognized, well estab­
23

lished, recognized not only by the decisions of this Court in
24

Pink, and it has a long paragraph on the importance of claims
25

52
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

settlement authority by scholars and by Congress itself.

2

And that is as a prelude to this point, Justice Rehnquist, that

3

the proposition that a bill that was drafted and lobbied by the

4

two Executive Branch departments that most depend and utilize

5

that claims settlement authority, would have had as its purpose

6

to take away that very authority without ever saying so, almost

7

borders on the absurd.

14

'■■■

Even the quote from Mr. Ristau, which Mr. Howard re­

10

11

And indeed, the few references in the

ferred to, acknowledges the existence of the claims settlement
authority.

And that brings me to the question, what about

jurisdiction and what about settlement of the claims through
submitting them to arbitration?
The Court of Appeals -- both of them — for the 1st

15
Circuit and the District of Columbia correctly reasoned that
16
this was an effort not to modify the power of the. courts, the
17
jurisdiction of the courts, to decide this case, but rather the
18
substantive rule of law that the courts are to apply.

All the

19
focus of all of the executive orders is very careful on the
20

claim, on the nature of the claim that is held by the claimants
21

and not on the power of the courts.

And as a consequence, the

22

judge in this case correctly dismissed this case, dismissed
23
the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could
24
be granted.
25

S3
North American Reporting

1

Now, the fact is, of course, that as a result of some­

2

thing that the Government has done, American courts will not be

3

deciding some of these cases.

4

stances in which that circumstance is true, that has never been

5

thought to give rise to Article III problems.

But there are a number of in­

And finally, it persists to this day that

dispositive.

When Mr. Howard takes the position that with

respect to the basic issue of claims settlement authority
Schooner Peggy is distinguishable because it was a treaty,
parenthetically, my answer to that is this.

That it's true

that Schooner Peggy did involve a treaty, but when by the time
you combine the holding and the rationale in Schooner Peggy
with the rationale, with the statement by this Court in Pink

20
concerning settlement authority, that those two taken together
21

make a pretty powerful argument for the existence of settlement
22

authority.

But with regard to the --

MR. LEE:

By the President himself; that is correct.

North American Reporting

as a matter of his Article II power.

2

QUESTION:

Well, how do you -- do you disagree, then,

3

with Justice Frankfurter's statement in the steel seizure cases

4

that just because the power does not reside in the President

5

doesn't mean that the Government as a whole doesn't have it,

6

and just because the Government as a whole has it doesn't mean

7

that the President by himself can exercise it?
MR. LEE:

8
9

I do agree with that statement, Justice

Rehnquist, and it is of course consistent with the trichotomy,

10

if you will, by Justice Jackson in that same case, that it's

11

simply a matter, if you have both the President acting with his

12

Article II power and Congress acting with its Article I power,

13

then it's all the stronger.

14

away, then it's weaker.
But coming back to the point of claims settlement

15
16
17
18
19

And if you have the Congress taken

authority, Justice Frankfurter also said -- this is the clearest
statement that you have anywhere -- in United States v. Pink,
that it is simply indisputable that the President has the claims
settlement authority.
But, coming back to the question of jurisdiction,

20
Schooner Peggy may or may not be distinguishable on the basic
21

issue of the President's claims settlement authority.

We think

22
that Peggy plus Pink makes a pretty powerful combination in that
23

respect.

But on the issue of jurisdiction Schooner Peggy is

24

absolutely dispositive, and a ruling could not come down by this

Significant in that respect, that in enacting the IEEPA
Congress clarified that nothing in that Act was intended "to
impede the settlement of claims of United States citizens
against foreign countries."
And that brings me back to where I started, and that
is that the principle that has to govern both of the questions
in this case is this, that a crisis such as that which we under­

19
went in this country for 14 months does not occur often.

But

20
on those rare occasions when it does occur, followed by the

opportunity for settlement on honorable and reasonable terms,

Oh the -- there was one proposition,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, on which all opinions in the steel sei­
zure case were in agreement and that is that this was one of the
cases that Justice Jackson would have said fell within the
category three; that is, where he had acted against the will of
Congress and in our view, this is either a category two or a

16

category one case, because of the fact that he has acted with
17

power of something more than just his own Article II power, but
18

that in any event his Article II power would have been suffi­

cient .
20

For these reasons, we respectfully submit that on
21

those rare occasions when a crisis such as that that occurred
22
does occur and the opportunity for settlement occurs, then some­

one has to have the power to act.

They do not require

I would submit that the attachment issues are essen­

whatever extent such an agreement would infringe upon the con­

16

unconstitutional, it would not be binding as a matter of domes­

No, that is not the question that we are

2

agreement between the two countries, the United States is under

3

an obligation to accomplish, to restore Iran to its financial

4

position as it existed prior to November 14, 1979, and to

5

accomplish that the United States has to assure the free

6

mobility of Iran's assets within this jurisdiction.

7

The basic question is, there is an

If the United States does not in fact accomplish the

8

restoration of Iran's financial position, and if it in fact does

9

not accomplish satisfaction of the obligations imposed under

10

paragraphs 4 through 9 of the Declarations, specifically the

11

transfer of specific categories of assets to Iran, then the

12

United States would arguably be in violation of the agreement

13

and .under international law liable for damages.

14

international tribunal which has been referred to today does in

16
17

Since the

fact exist, and since it does in fact have jurisdiction over
disputes of this

nature between the parties, then the tribunal

would he in a position and arguably has the authority to impose a
damage judgment against the United States in the full amount of
Iran's assets as they exist in this country.
QUESTION:

What if part of the agreement had provided

20

that for one year no one should criticize the Ayatollah in this
21

country?

Would the United States be liable for damages if

22

any person in this country criticized the Ayatollah?
23

MR. SHACK:

Well, again, despite the inconsistency

24
25

with, domestic law, the United States would be obligated by

objectives of the agreement.

QUESTION:

It is unlikely that any Executive

But you're saying that under international

6

law they are bound to carry out an agreement if such an Execu­

7

tive would have done so.

8
9

MR. SHACK:

Yes, I would suggest that that is true.

If the Executive had made such an agreement, the United States

10

would be obligated to attempt to carry out the obligations of

11

the agreement.
I observe that this international principle which says

12
13

that international law is binding regardless of domestic law

14

also leads me to the fourth point, which is that the courts of

15

this country have traditionally construed domestic law in such

16

a way as wherever possible not to cause a breach of an inter­

17

national agreement with a foreign sovereign.
Under the Algerian Declarations, as I mentioned a

18
19
20

moment ago in answer to your question, Justice Rehnquist, the
United States is obligated to restore Iran's financial position
as it existed prior to November 14, 1979, and to assure the

21

free mobility of its assets within this jurisdiction by that
22
date.

As I said, that’s paragraphs 4 through 9 and the trigger

23

date on that requirement is July 19 of this year.

MR.SHACK:

MR. SHACK:

-

Well, the tribunal itself will probably

be the ultimate judge of that since it has jurisdiction on such
matters, but the clear language requires termination rather
than suspension.

Presumably the United States in any dispute

on that matter would submit to the tribunal that suspension
has accomplished the same thing and that termination will follow
adjudications or awards by the tribunal.

But until --

No, I'm talking about cases in which the

MR. SHACK: Yes.
QUESTION:

If the President had not vested the assets

in that case, there had been no vesting order, just the freeze
followed by an attachment, would the Trading with the Enemy Act
have allowed the President to unfreeze the assets and return
the assets to the foreign nation free of the attachment?
MR. SHACK:
QUESTION:

I believe that it would.
Well, Orvis said that the attachment was

good against the foreign country.

It wasn't good against the

President's vesting, but it was perfectly good despite the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC M. LIEBERMAN, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF' INTERVENOR BANK MARKAZI IRAN

11

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

12

the Court:
13

No litigant nor lower court has challenged the exis­
14

tence of an undisputed emergency crisis situation which prompted
15

the Executive's action here.

Thus the issue before this Court

16

is not whether the Executive generally may settle the claims of
17

United States nationals against foreign states, although his­
18

torically he's done so.

Rather the question is a narrower one

19

dealing with whether he may do so in such an international
20
crisis.

Put this way,, the question highlights the reason why

21

the Executive's power to settle claims both historically and
22

doctrinally has been held to be a necessary element of the
23

foreign affairs power.
24

The claims are more than mere bargaining chips in

Potentially they do,

You have in effect a confrontation between citizens

7
8

Rather, the claims themselves create an impediment,

Absolutely.

However --

What if Congress said that the President

shall not in the future settle any foreign claims?
MR. LIEBERMAN:

14

That would raise substantial constitu­

tional questions.
15

QUESTION:

And the President signed the bill?

16

MR. LIEBERMAN:

The President -- that President may.

17

have signed the bill but the question is whether constitutionally
18

that Congress and that President can limit the power of the
19

Presidency as an institution.

Fortunately, that is a question,

20
that kind of constitutional confrontation

is not before this

21

Court.

What you have is a pattern, an historical pattern, of

22

congressional acquiescence in approval of and facilitation of
23

the President's foreign claims settlement power.

And this

24

pattern continued contemporaneously with the enactment of the
25

70
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and afterward.

2

Congress which considered the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

3

and enacted it in 1976 considered amendments to something called

4

the Case Act, which required the Executive to make reports to

5

Congress whenever he entered into executive agreements.

6

The very

Several Congressmen introduced amendments to the

7

Case Act which would have given Congress the right to override

8

executive agreements by concurrent resolution or otherwise.

9

The Executive Branch -- the State Department, the

10

Justice Department -- at the same time they were asking the

11

Congress to pass the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which

12

after all the Executive Branch drafted, at the very same time

13
14
15
16
17
18

they appeared before the committees in Congress and said, don't
pass this act limiting the executive agreement power.

They

canvassed the historical exercise of it, they focused particu­
larly on the claims settlement power, on this Court’s opinions
in Belmont and Pink, and they argued that it would be unconsti­
tutional for the Congress to limit the executive power in this
way, particularly with respect to claims settlement agreements.

19

They focused on that in their arguments to Congress.

Congress,

20

of course, did not enact the act, the very same Congress which
21

did enact the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, without a word
22

that it was doing anything to undermine the historical claims
23

settlement power.
24

QUESTION:
25

Well, under your theory they didn't really
71
North American Reporting

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

need to enact the Act, did they?

2

MR. LIEBERMAN:

3

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand the questior

Well, on what you've been saying up to now,

4

with the broad general powers of the President, they didn't

5

need the Act, did they?

6

MR. LIEBERMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LIEBERMAN:

9

Yes.

The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act?
The President didn't need it, did he?
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

did not deal with the claims settlement power.

That's my point.

10

One year later Congress did not think that it had done anything

11

to undermine the Claims Settlement Act when it enacted the

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

International Economic Powers Act, because that Congress, while
it limited some of the Trading with the Enemy Act powers in
times of peacetime national emergency, it specifically said
these limitations do not affect the President's power to settle
the claims of United States nationals against foreign states.
Now, if the Congress had thought that it had taken
that power away a year earlier when it enacted the Sovereign
Immunities Act, it wouldn't have bothered to say that when

19

we're enacting the Emergency Economic Powers Act, we’re not
20
taking that power away.
21

There's another point about the Emergency Economic
22
Powers Act that is worth emphasis.

Pursuant to that Act the

23

President must make reports to the Congress when he invokes
24

his IEEPA powers.
25

He must say what he has done and why he's

2

acted improperly and by concurrent resolution, not a statute,

precisely here.

to the Congress as to what they did.

6

ings, three different committee hearings; they are mentioned in

our brief.

10

And that was done

The President, both Presidents, made reports
The Congress held hear­

The Senate Committee issued a report; there was no

And the Congress may then consider whether he has

resolution.

Some of the claimants came in and asked the

Congress to exercise its powers to block the implementation of
the Algerian Declarations.

If the Congress didn't think there

was a problem, as a matter of fact, the Senate report indicated
a continuing recognition of the executive power to settle
claims and a feeling among the Committee that this power was
necessary if the United States Executive was to deal with an
equal with foreign states.
So that what' you have here are both political branches

17

of the United States Government recognizing this power.
18

Congress has set. the terms for its review of executive imple­
19

mentation of the IEEPA powers.

And it has found that there

20

hasn't been a problem there.

I think under those circumstances

21

it becomes a political question, it's a question committed to
22

the political branches.

Congress is not disenabled from acting

23

here.

It can exercise its power if it feels that there has beer

24

a violation and if it doesn't feel that there has been 25

73

QUESTION:

President acting all by himself.

from the IEEPA end?

5

HR. LIEBERMAN:

You are deriving some support

Oh, absolutely.

What I meant before

6

is that even in the absence of any kind of Congressional facili­

tation, approval, acquiescence, the President would have the

power.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

decide that there was a taking, that would be on the threshold

in the Court of Claims.

4

MR. LIEBERMAN:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

My point is --

My problem on your political question argu­

6

ment is going to suggest that we couldn't, it's none of our

business to decide whether there was a taking or not.

8

MR. LIEBERMAN:

11

I don't think the question is before

this Court.
QUESTION:

12
13

You don't go that far?

MR. LIEBERMAN:

10

Well, I don't think --

That's not my question.

I'm asking whether

your political question submission embraces whether or not we
should decide whether it's -- or even address the taking issue.

14

MR. LIEBERMAN:

I think to the extent that the Court

15

addresses the taking issue, it should hold that there is a
16

Tucker Act remedy.

QUESTION:

All right.

Then we do address it, you

suggest?
19

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Yeah.

And that that is a complete

answer.

QUESTION:

The claim is that there has been a taking

right now, and that the taking question is not premature, so it

is at least -- something that is before us.

MR. LIEBERMAN:

I know --

-- there is no taking by the attach­

something which we have touched on the periphery but not the

core, at least in my view.

And that is, how the President of

the United States exercising his Article II powers to conduct
21
foreign relations can do so if he cannot have regulatory power

MR. HOWARD:

First, there's a systematic matter.

If

3

the Executive believes he needs this authority I think he ought

4

to go to Congress and get it, although in the hearings in the

5

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act enactment, the Executive said

6

he didn't need it.

The Executive specifically said, the pres­

Please take this away.

that this kind of claim should be in the courts and not before

They agreed

particular case he needs the power, now, to deal with these law­
suits.

In fact, let me tie this together with Mr. Shack's

talking about the agreement and whether it's enforceable or not.
.And what would be the consequences if this Court were to find
that these Acts were outside the power of the President?
First of all, the Reagan Administration has very care­

19

fully never taken a position as to whether this is an enforce­
20

able agreement under international law.

And quite frankly, one

21

of the many principles of international law is that agreements
22

entered into under duress with a gun at your head aren't
23

enforceable, just as they aren't in many civilized countries.
24

So that if this agreement is struck down, they may very well

One of the problems

here is that there is a suggestion, I think, that goes through

the questioning, that this problem all goes away if it's a
18

taking, and that we can just go to the Court of Claims.
19

Unfortunately, there's a big catch.

There is no remedy for

20

an unauthorized taking.

If we are right on the power questions,

21

then we have no remedy, because no one is liable for an unau­

thorized taking.

That is the law which is cited in our brief.

Under the Trading with the

Your argument about the Trading with the

Enemy Act is no stronger than it is under the IEEPA, is it?

7

It's the same language, isn't it?

MR. HOWARD:

QUESTION:

14
15

QUESTION:

18

What authority, do you say, what authority?

Is Orvis your best case for saying that he would have no author­
ity

in Orvis

to have transferred the assets to the

foreign nation without a vesting free of the attachment?
MR. HOWARD:

16
17

The freezing language is the same.

The vesting language is not there.

12
13

Except for the vesting?

MR. HOWARD:

10

11

It's the freezing --

I would say two things.

President ever did it.

Number one, no

And that ought to tell us something.

No President ever did it or tried it.

But secondly, wouldn't

it have been crazy to have a rule that said, if the President
19

takes the property, he has to hold it for the American credi­
20

tors?

He takes it under his vesting power; he has to hold it

21

for American creditors.

But under the freeze he can send it

22
back free and clear?

That doesn't make any sense.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that's just your, argument in this

24
25

respect. Shouldn't you make the same crazy-sort-of-a-notion

argument as you do with the IEEPA?

2

MR. HOWARD:

No, I say that since he couldn't do it

3

under Trading with the Enemy Act, because that would have made

4

the statute crazy.
QUESTION:

5

Well, wait a minute.

Are you suggesting

6

the only possible purpose of a freeze order under the Trading

7

with the Enemy Act is to protect American creditors?

8

MR. HOWARD:

9

QUESTION:
MR. HOWARD:

10

11

Obviously, it was --

There are many other purposes.
First, was to thwart the enemy, and to

make sure the enemy couldn't get access to its own property.
QUESTION:

12
13

No, no.

And support the war effort in various

different ways, too.
MR. HOWARD:

14

QUESTION:

That's right.

But if the President --

It may have nothing to do with American

15

creditors, and that could be true of freezes as well as vesting
16

orders.
17

MR. HOWARD:

Although once he vested he had to —

18

yeah, there was a whole claims procedure set up to satisfy even
19

unsecured creditors, people who didn't have property at all
20
but who had a claim against that particular nation.
21

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Howard, don't you think there's

22

something to Professor Henkin's statement in his treatise on
23

international law, or international agreements, in 1972, that

You, the Justices of the Supreme Court, are going

to make new law in this case, that no matter what you decide,
you're going to make new law.

And that is the state of the

record.
20

As far as Mr. Henkin's treatise is concerned, the
21

first and foremost thing about it is what you said, it was
22

written in 1972.

So it was written before the Foreign Sovereign

No, the Government won't concede that.

That was the new rule of law.

QUESTION:

Well, the rule of law is you lose in this

No, but you're arguing with Schooner Peggy

now, saying that's not a substantive rule of law.
MR. HOWARD:

No, no.

Schooner Peggy wasn't, go to

another court; it is, you lose.
QUESTION:

That's right, if you lose.

But the only

20

reason you lose is we've decided you should lose; you can't

have this prize money.

QUESTION:

The President so far hasn't quite decided

23

that my client should lose.

QUESTION:

I don't know whether that's so different

from saying, you can't have this attachment.
MR. HOWARD:

No, I'm saying, the President is saying,

I'm not going to decide whether you win or lose but I'm going

to make you go to a different court than the one the

MR. HOWARD:

I believe that is their position.

QUESTION:

Which means that there's a new rule of law.

QUESTION:

The principle of the action brought after -

MR. HOWARD:

The Government's position is that our

judgment, our final judgment, which surmounted all these alleged
15

difficulties that we've been relieved of, has been annulled. •
16

That's the Government's position.
17

QUESTION:

Well, they say it's converted into a claim,

18

which is what was in the Schooner Peggy case too.

They're

19

saying it's really no more than a claim because the appellate
20

process hasn't run its course yet.
21

MR. HOWARD:

I think perhaps that it was a mistake fo’r

22

me to engage in dialogue about whether it's a new rule of law
23

or not, because it does obscure the most important point.

It might be a taking, but they -It would still be a taking; you would

still have to pay for it.

But at least it would be authorized.

10

But in the current situation our position is that if the present

11

Administration wants to go through with this, they've got to

12

get two-thirds of the Senate or get the majority of each house

13

of Congress and appropriate the money.
QUESTION:

14

Let me go back to my original hypothetical,

15

somewhat.

or others, and you prevailed in this case, would not the other

20

If the President is negotiating in some delicate,

sovereign in negotiation say, well, we are glad to treat with
your ambassador, your envoy, but before we conclude anything
we want your Supreme Court to pass on whether the President
has exceeded his powers.

Isn't that a natural consequence of

21

your position?
22

MR. HOWARD:

If the Court were to rule for the Peti­

23

tioner, and there are future negotiations going on in which the
24
25

other power wants to achieve some results in courts, I'd say

the President had better go to the Congress first and get that

authority.

MR. HOWARD:

I think if the Court were to rule our

way, that it would be rather clear, then, that the President
couldn't do that, and that's not something that he could
bargain with.
QUESTION:

And you suggest that would not impair the

President's power to conduct foreign relations and national
14

defense problems?
15

MR. HOWARD:

The President's inability to compromise

16

or give away claims pending in court would of course be -- if
17

he couldn't do that, that's one less thing that he can't do -18

it's one more thing that he can't do.

But he also can't write

19

a check on the Treasury.
20

QUESTION:

Well, he can't conscript or raise and

support armies either.

And of course, one of your arguments is

that he's been forbidden to do this.

He

The two, the Executive and the Congress

got together, and they agreed that this should be outside of
the Executive.

They should be free of pressure.

Now, if the

Executive were, if the arguments made by my adversaries were
correct, the Executive is right back in the box.

Every time

a suit called a commercial suit now is filed, the foreign power
who doesn't like it has the same kind of opportunity that he

16

had before to come to the State Department and now, he doesn't

say, would you suggest immunity?

It's, would you mind' settling

18

my case?

I think we'll able to conclude that other matter much

more expeditiously.

And that's precisely what both branches

20

of the Government, the President and the Congress, said they

didn't want to happen.

Here we had an emergency; no one doubts that.

And

it happened.

But it's in emergencies that lines get crossed
