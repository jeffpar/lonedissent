ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. BLANCA BIANCHI de la TORRE

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MRS. BIANCHI de la TORRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In 1963 this Court held that the denial of unemploy­

10

ment compensation benefits to a person who refuses otherwise

11

available and suitable work for religious reasons was a denial

12

of that person's right to the free exercise of religion.

13
14
15

17

19

With facts very similar to those that this Court had
before it in Sherbert v. Verner, the Supreme Court of Indiana
has upheld the denial of unemployment compensation benefits to
the petitioner, Eddie C. Thomas.

The facts before this Court

which were determined by the Referee of the Division and af­
firmed by the Review Board reveal the following.
Mr. Thomas was specially hired into the roll foundry
of respondent, Blaw-Knox.

20

QUESTION:

What did they make there, what kind of

21

fabricating did they do there?
22

MRS. BIANCHI:

Mr. Chief Justice, this is not a matter

23

of record but I can inform the Court that the roll foundry was
24

engaged in the production of steel rolls to be used in the steel

QUESTION:

Some of it might get into tank turrets,

I suppose?
MRS. BIANCHI:

It is possible; yes.

QUESTION:

Or trucks and --

6

QUESTION:

Does all of it get into tank service?

7

MRS. BIANCHI:

Again, the record does not reveal that.

8

It is possible that some of these rolls went to other divisions

9

of Blaw-Knox.

Now, some of these rolls were also sold to

10

other steel mills in the area, like Bethelehem Steel, Inland

11

Steel, for different and varied purposes.

Mr. Thomas was working in the roll foundry for approx­

13

imately a year.

He worked as a chain-

When Mr. Thomas was transferred to the tank turret
line, he realized that his new job involved the direct manufac­
ture of armaments.
QUESTION:

At this time -Had he been a Jehovah's Witness when he

20
was first employed?
21

MRS. BIANCHI:

Yes.

When he became an employee of

QUESTION:

The record's pretty obscure — that's the

same answer you've given me each time, and --

7

MRS. BIANCHI:

Well, the record reveals that he was

8

going to ask the congregation to make a decision but the record

9

does not indicate whether the congregation made the decision.

10

However, Mr. Thomas did reach a decision that the work he was

11

performing in the tank turret line was against his religious

12

belief.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Is there any claim in this case that his

beliefs were not bona fide religious beliefs?
MRS. BIANCHI:

Well, the Supreme Court of Indiana

16

seems to attack, not his sincerity, but the nature and the basis

17

of his belief.

18
19

20

The Supreme Court of Indiana essentially says,

well, it isn't clear what his belief is and the nature and
basis of the same.
QUESTION:

And pointed to another Jehovah's Witness

who had continued —
21

MRS. BIANCHI:

Yes.

And then they say, even if it's a

22

religious belief, it's not a cardinal tenet of his religion
23

and it's not shared by the congregation.
24

QUESTION:

That in your submission is entirely

25

5

\
1

irrelevant.
2
MRS. BIANCHI:
3

Yes.

They are irrelevant.

What we

are arguing is that a belief, a religious belief which is sin­

4

cerely held, even though it's not consistent -5

QUESTION:

6

Even though it's held by only this person?

MRS. BIANCHI:

Yes, yes, Mr. Justice, even though it's

7

not consistent with the philosophy -- excuse me, consistent

8

with but not adopted by the religion to which this person

9

belongs is protected by the First Amendment.

10

That's essentially

our claim before this Court.

11

QUESTION:

12

MRS. BIANCHI:

13

QUESTION:

Mrs. de la Torre?
Yes, Mr. Justice?

To the extent that you are quoting from the

14

record or saying that the record shows, I take it the final

15

guide for us is what the opinion of the Supreme Court of

16

Indiana says insofar as it speaks to the question, as to what

17

the facts are?
MRS. BIANCHI:

18
19
20

21
22
23

No, the facts appear in the record in

the decision of the Referee that was affirmed by the Review
Board.
QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, if the Supreme Court of

Indiana says the facts were different than that, we take the
facts as stated by the Supreme Court of Indiana, do we not?
MRS. BIANCHI:

Well, the problem with that is that the

24

Supreme Court seems to challenge the fact but never reverses or

They raise this question but never reverse the Review

In fact, they say, "We affirm the Review

QUESTION:

Well, it's possible to affirm a lower

tribunal on a different ground, is it not?

6

MRS. BIANCHI:

7

QUESTION:

That is possible; yes.

Mrs. de la Torre, suppose that Mr.

Thomas

8

had reached the point where all work was against his religious

9

convictions.

10

Would you still be here?

MRS. BIANCHI:

We would have to look at that claim

but I am willing, able, and available to return to the roll

17

violate my religious belief.

QUESTION:

But that is not our

What if in the Selective Service cases that

were decided in the late 60s and early 70s where it was held
that an ethical or sincerely held moral belief, even though
nonreligiously founded, was adequate for conscientious objec­

21

tion.

What if his views stemmed from that rather than from his

22

membership in Jehovah's Witnesses?
23

MRS. BIANCHI:

Well, this is a constitutional claim

24

and that definition of religion

which was adopted in Seeger

25

and Welsh has not been expanded to the First Amendment.
7

And we

1
2
3
4
5

are saying that we don't have to go that far.

That's not the

issue in this case because he belongs to a well-established
and known religion that is no stranger to the federal judiciary,
the Jehovah's Witnesses, and we don't need to look for an
answer in Seeger or Welsh.

6

The Referee concluded that Mr. Thomas quit

for reli­

7

gious reasons because as a Jehovah's Witness he was specifi­

8

cally exempted from aiding in or producing armaments used in the

9

advancement of war.
The Court of Appeals of Indiana said that the facts

10

11

were not in dispute in that with those facts Sherbert was con­

12

trolling.

The Court of Appeals of Indiana held that the dis­

3

qualifying provisions of the Indiana Code 22-4-15-1 as applied

4

to Thomas imposed a burden on the exercise of his First Amend­

5

ment right to the free exercise of religion.

6

Because the

to justify any infringement, the Court of Appeals reversed the
Review Board and awarded benefits to Thomas.
The case came before the Supreme Court of Indiana on
a petition to transfer filed by the Board.

In a 3-2 decision

20

the Supreme Court of Indiana attempts to distinguish Sherbert
2

and in doing so applies erroneous standards.

Like we said be­

22

fore, the Supreme Court said, well, it isn't clear what his
23

belief was and the basis of his belief.

If it's religious, it's

24

not a cardinal tenet, and even if it is religious, it's not

dards.

These are erroneous stan­

There's no requirement that this be a cardinal tenet

of the religion to which this person belongs or that it be
shared by all the members of the congregation.

The critical

point is whether this is a religious belief and whether it is

sincerely held by this individual.

From reading the cases that this Court

has had before it involving Jehovah's Witnesses opposed to
military service, it is clear they oppose all the wars of this
world.

And I refer to the Sicurella case, a 1955 decision of

this Court.

Mr. Thomas describes his beliefs as religious and

I would like to, if the Court allows me, read from a transcript
of the Referee before the hearing — from the hearing before
the Referee.

Thomas says, and I quote:

21

"I really could not, you know, conscientiously con­
22

tinue to work with armaments.

It would be against all of

23

the religious principles that I have come to learn and
24

appreciate except up to this point."

the conclusion of the hearing had said, I don't believe
Mr. Thomas ?

Mrs. de la Torre, what if the Referee at

MRS. BIANCHI:
Thomas quit

Well, then he could have concluded that

for personal reasons, but he didn't do that.

In

fact he said, the Referee, oh, I can understand, I can see your

difficulty, and I have the utmost respect for your religious

8

principles.

9

the words of the Referee.

10

And I'm quoting from the transcript.

QUESTION:

Those are

And what if the Supreme Court of Indiana

11

had said after the Referee said what you have just quoted him as

12

saying, we find that the Referee committed reversible error in

13

believing Thomas?
MRS. BIANCHI:

14
15

The Supreme Court of Indiana never

said that.

16

QUESTION:

But what if it had?

17

MRS. BIANCHI:

Then they would have reversed the con­

18

clusion of the Referee and we would still be here because we

19

think that the record supports the conclusion of the Referee.

20
21

22
23
24

QUESTION:

But didn't the -- the Referee said he quit

for religious reasons?
MRS. BIANCHI:
QUESTION:

The Supreme Court said, we disagree.

MRS. BIANCHI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The Supreme Court said --

You could certainly interpret what they

25
10

1

were disagreeing with as including the reasons.
2

MRS. BIANCHI:

3
4

QUESTION:

7
8

MRS. BIANCHI:

Okay.

Then I say that the Supreme

Court of Indiana was wrong if they in fact reversed the Referee,
because the evidence in the record reveals that there is suffi­
cient evidence.

9

QUESTION:

10

11

Well, then, if they disagree with the

referee on that fact-finding, where are you?

5
6

Well, I agree with that, Mr. Justice.

Is that a federal question then?

MRS. BIANCHI:

The constitutional claim is a federal

question.

12

QUESTION:

Is it a federal question on the narrow

13

hypothetical Mr. Justice White has just posed, that the state

14

court has reversed the referee on what could be his credibility

15

findings?

16

on credibility of witnesses unseen by the reviewing court would

17

be an error of some kind. Is it a federal question error?

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

Now, let's assume, hupothetically, that reversing

MRS. BIANCHI:

It would not be a federal question if

we didn't have a free exercise claim involved.

But this Court

has held that when free exercise or constitutional claims are
involved it is free to review the facts and come to its own
conclusion, especially when the constitutional claim is denied
on facts as determined by the -QUESTION:

MRS. BIANCHI:

Court can look -QUESTION:

Again, we submit that Mr. Thomas' opposition to work­

I believe this Court can.

15

16

The Court cannot --

17

QUESTION:

Could the connection be so tenuous that

18

the reviewing courts could reverse?

cals suggested.

Let me take a hypothetical

Suppose he was working in a factory making

threshing machines for farms and he reasoned that threshing
machines would be used to produce wheat which might go to
Russia and he does not want, his religious belief forbids his
doing anything to help the communist world.

Would that be in

your view too tenuous and speculative to sustain a religious
12

1

claim?

2
3
4
5

MRS. BIANCHI:

Again, I would have to go back to the

test, is this a religious belief, and is it sincerely held?
That would be the answer, the only answer in every case where a
person raises the constitutional claim; we're going to have to

6

face that threshold question.

7

on both questions, then we're going to have to go to the test

8

as advanced in Sherbert, which is what the Supreme Court of

9

Indiana fails to do.

10

QUESTION:

And then, if the answer is yes

But you said before, this being a case

11

involving turrets for tanks, tanks are reasonably used only in

12

warfare.

We don't have those difficult questions.
MRS. BIANCHI:

13

No, we don't have them in here.

In

14

looking at the sincerity, since the courts according to the doc­

15

trines of Fowler and United States v. Ballard cannot inquire

16

into the validity of the belief, the courts can and do, most of

17

the time, look into the sincerity.
QUESTION:

18

MRS. BIANCHI:

19
20
21

Which court?

In a —
This Court in reviewing?

The trial court, the appellate court.

They're not prevented, you know, from looking at the sincerity
of the belief.

Once a First Amendment claim or a constitution­

al claim is raised, then the courts must answer those two ques­
22

tions:

if this is a religious belief, is it sincerely held?

23

And in looking at sincerity, consistency with a belief, con­
24

sistency of this belief with the tenets of a well-established
25

13

1

religion may be persuasive on the issue of this person's sin­

3
4
5
6
7

cerity but it's not conclusive.

There are other extrinsic

facts that the courts can consider to determine sincerity.

One

of those is, what role does religion play in the life of this
individual?

In Thomas's case we submit that religion plays a

central role in his life.

He's a Jehovah's Witness, his hobbies

are Bible study and Bible reading.

His belief is consistent

8

with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses who are opposed to

9

war.

10

Furthermore, Mr. Thomas was willing to take a 50 per­

11

cent cut in his income in order to live his life according to

12

his religious belief.

13

belief was religious in nature and sincerely held.

14

And that, we submit, shows that his

The analysis, then, in a free exercise case, is, is

15

there a burden on the free exercise of religion?

16

is, is it justified by a compelling state interest?

17

case we believe that there is an infringement on his First

18

Amendment rights, the same infringement that this Court found

19

in Sherbert vs. Verner.

20

23

Mr. Thomas' ineligibility for

unemployment compensa­

tion benefits derives solely from the practice of his religion.
Like in Sherbert, he is forced to choose between following the
precepts of his religion and forfeiting benefits on the one
hand, or abandoning the precepts of his religion to remain em­

24

ployed, on the other hand.

This, this Court has held, is an

25

1

unconstitutional choice.

in McDaniel v. Paty

And this same test had been applied

and Wisconsin v. Yoder.

The Review Board

has conceded that it has no compelling state interest to justi­
fy the infringement on Thomas's First Amendment rights.

No com­

pelling state interest was raised or briefed before the state
courts below, and now the Review Board

for the first time in

these proceedings has attempted to introduce before this Court
a compelling state interest.
This Court has consistently held that it will not

10

consider matters raised here for the first time which were

11

never briefed or raised in the lower courts below.

12

so only when there is plain error, and we submit that is not

13

in this case, that is not our case.

14

there is no compelling state interest.

cumstances we respectfully request this Court that the infringe­

16

Yes?

Do you have any comment on that?

MRS. BIANCHI:

Yes.

We submit that Sherbert expanded

the test advanced in Braunfeld and this Court has not expressly
overruled Braunfeld although in recent decisions -- I believe
in the Wisconsin v. Yoder or McDaniel v. Paty,

Justice Brennan

indicated that candor compels an admission that Braunfeld has
15

been overruled.

QUESTION:

But has the Court overruled it?

MRS. BIANCHI:

No, it has not been overruled, but I

think that the Court has expanded the test to require the state
a greater burden of proof when there is an infringement on First

6

Amendment rights, which was not the test in Braunfeld.

7

feld has been, I think, not overruled but severely limited by

8

the test in Sherbert, which this Court has consistently applied

ever since Sherbert was decided.

It's in East Chicago, Indiana.

In East Chicago.
Finally, we would like to indicate

that granting unemployment compensation benefits to the peti­
tioner does not amount to a violation of the Establishment
Clause.

This argument was rejected in Sherbert, and also in

McDaniel v. Paty,

decided by this Court in 1978.

All that the

state is doing in granting unemployment compensation benefits tc
Thomas is acting with neutrality in the light of serious reli­
gious differences in our nation.
16

This Court has characterized

1
2
3

itself for encouraging benevolent neutrality, the doctrine of
flexibility in its approach to the religion clauses of the First
Amendment.

4

We submit that the decision of the Supreme Court of
Indiana is erroneous, that it should be reversed, and that

6

Thomas should be entitled to unemployment compensation benefits.

We would like to reserve the time left for rebuttal.

MRS. BIANCHI:

That's correct.

When you say, a state fund, is the state

any more than a keeper of the stakes?

That is, the state

impounds the money coming from the employer.

There's no tax on

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM E. DAILY

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DAILY:

13
14

The

record is silent on that, is it?

3
4

I'm not sure.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The answer is that the contributions are made solely

15
16

by the employers to the fund.

17

although I would suppose that the employer views it as a tax

18

on the employer to create the fund in the first,place.
Before I get to the meat of my argument, I have to

19
20
21

22
23

There are no general tax funds,

address a point raised in the petitioner's reply brief and also
addressed in oral argument today.

I do not believe the Review

Board has ever conceded that there is not a compelling state
interest.

There is some ambiguous language in the opinion of

the State Court of Appeals which seems to say that at oral argu­
24

ment there may have been a concession by the State on a
25

19

1

compelling state interest issue but the Review Board's position
2

is only that.

There is no evidence on the record as to the

3

existence or nonexistence of a compelling state interest, and
4

the reason for that blank record is that the Review Board was
5

not a party at the hearing stage.
6
7

8
9

The Review Board has never

had any opportunity to present facts into evidence on the exis­
tence or nonexistence of a compelling state interest.

When I

think of that, I think I will show as I go through my argument
that compelling state interest is not really relevant to this

10

case and the case can be decided without addressing that issue.

11

But if you do want to address that issue, the Review Board

12

should be given an opportunity to present facts if the case

13

should be remanded.

Do you think that Sherbert should be over­

MR. DAILY:

I think it should be modified.

I think

there are some very good points in Sherbert but I think it goes
too far.

I'm not sure that Sherbert by itself goes too far,

6

but it's certainly been interpreted by subsequent courts and

7

by some decisions from this Court more broadly than the deci­

8

sion itself warrants.

9

And I'll get to that in a moment.

The petitioner in this case relies heavily on Sherbert

10

v. Verner; in fact, almost exclusively.

11

Supreme Court looked to Sherbert and attempted to distinguish

12

it.

13

in Sherbert specifically limits itself.

14

"We do not by our decision today declare the existence of a

15

constitutional right to unemployment benefits on the part of

16

all persons" — "all persons whose religious convictions are

the cause of their unemployment."

18

language, the petitioner in this case says that all persons are

19

entitled to unemployment benefits under Sherbert.

20

21

23
24

Therefore, the Indiana

The court, the Indiana Supreme Court noted that the opinior
The language says,

Now, despite that clear

Now Sherbert didn't say that.

It said, we do not make

that finding.
QUESTION:

Well, I think the -- my understanding of

the reason for that language in Sherbert was to take care of
my brother Blackmun's earlier hypothetical question as to what
about the person whose religious convictions taught him that it

25

22

1

was sin to work at all, at anything.

2
3

MR. DAILY:

Well, I agree that there may be a spec­

trum here, going from that situation perhaps to a Sherbert.

4

QUESTION:

Such a person, say, in the absence of that

5

language in Sherbert, could say, I'm entitled to workmen's

6

compensation -- I'm entitled to unemployment compensation.

7

MR. DAILY:

And the petitioner did not deny that that

8

person should — in fact, the petitioner's position is that if

9

there is a sincere religious conviction, sincerely held by an

10

individual, that person is entitled to unemployment benefits

11

no matter what his conviction is, even if it is that I should

12

not be required to work at all.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DAILY:
QUESTION:

15
16
17

That's not this case.
No.

Obviously not.

What is the status of people, if any, in

many of the courts, who would have a religious objection and
scruple against participating in social security?
MR. DAILY:

18

QUESTION:

19

In the Indiana courts?
There have been some cases on that,

haven't there, in the lower courts?
20

MR. DAILY:

I'm not prepared to discuss that; I'm

21

sorry.

To continue my distinguishment of Sherbert, Sherbert

22

involved a situation where South Carolina had a state law giving
23

benefits to Sunday worshipers.

Sherbert extended that same

24

privilege to Saturday worshipers.
25

23

There is no comparable

situation in the case before you today.

with giving equality to Saturday worshipers that Sunday wor­
shipers already have.

7

We are not dealing

Sherbert found that the highest state court had not
been able to point out any state interest.

In this case the

Indiana Supreme Court clearly points out the state interest to
be protected and those state interests, if I may skip to another

8

point, are to promote the stability in employment, to protect

9

the citizens from the hardships of unemployment, preserving

10

the unemployment fund.

Those state interests are in my opinion

And there I will refer you

Mr. Daily, I don't think it's quite correct

15

to say that there were no state interests involved in Sherbert.

spurious claims which would also be present here, and also a

state interest in not making, complicating the work schedule

there.
MR. DAILY:

22
23
24

So there were state interests

That is correct.

And those state interest s

would exist here, in addition to the interests that I have
listed.

In this case, however, we have the highest court of

the State finding that those interests that I have listed are
25

24

1

sufficient to sustain the statute.

2
3
4
5

6

Similar cases inquire as to whether or not there are
other ways to achieve the secular state purposes or achieve the
interest established by the case.

And I note that the peti­

tioners have not pointed out any other ways to achieve these
secular interests or secular purposes.

7

As I read the opinion of the Indiana Supreme Court,

8

that Court based its decision on three general and independent

9

grounds.

There are three different grounds for sustaining the

10

Indiana Court's opinion.

11

the statutory good cause requirement has a valid secular pur­

12

pose and a valid secular effect.

13

v. Brown test.

14

a valid secular effect; it is therefore a constitutional stat­

15

ute .

First of all, the Court found that

In other words, the Braunfeld

Under that test we have a valid secular purpose,

Secondly, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the

16
17

grant of an exemption to Mr. Thomas would conflict with the

18

Establishment Clause in the Constitution, as a second indepen­

19

dent grounds, also requiring that the statute be found to be

20

constitutional.

QUESTION:

21

22
23

Thirdly, the Supreme Court went into the -Mr. Daily, wasn't that argument specifi­

cally rejected in Verner, both by the majority and by the dis­
senters ?
MR. DAILY:

To that extent I am arguing for a modifi­

24

cation of Sherbert v. Verner.
25

25

1

QUESTION:

That's why you asked for the modification?

2

MR. DAILY:

To the extent that that has been found by

other courts, I think it should be modified.
4

And I'd like to address that question now.

In Walz

v. the New York Tax Commission, this Court noted that past
opinions had considerable internal inconsistency because of
certain sweeping statements.

This Court also recognized that

there could be a potential conflict between the religion
clauses, and a test proposed in Walz v. New York Tax Commission

10

is, first of all, examine the legislative purpose; secondly,

11

examine the degree of involvement between church and state.

12

The current Indiana practice withstands these tests .

13

Legislative purpose is a valid secular purpose, the degree of

14

involvement is almost zero.

had to examine the sincerity or the contents of Mr. Thomas's

beliefs was because it had to distinguish Sherbert, or perhaps

17

Wisconsin v. Yoder.

18

22
23
24
25

The only reason that the Court

Under the current procedure in Indiana there is
really no reason beyond those cases for an examination or for
an involvement of the church with the state.

However, if the

state were to pass a statute saying that persons in Mr. Thomas's
situation are exempt from the objective

good cause requirement,

if you examine that statute, the statute proposed by Mr. Thomas
here -- although Mr. Thomas is not proposing a statute, he's
proposing the Court do something to the same effect, to create
26

1

for Indiana an exemption.

5

exemption or if the Legislature in Indiana were to create that
exemption and were examined under the Walz test, you would have
to find a secular legislative purpose for an exemption for
people in Mr. Thomas's situation.

6

If the Court were to create that

Now I submit that there is no reasonable secular
purpose for that exemption.

I don't think you will find a rea­

sonable purpose stated in the briefs.

9

brief seems to think that a secular purpose would be avoidance

I've noted one amicus

10

of conflict with the religion clauses and that argument seems

11

to me somewhat circular.

You can point out as a secular purpose

for the denial of the relief an avoidance of conflict with the

3

Establishment Clause.
In any event, there is no valid secular purpose for

Then it becomes necessary to examine Mr. Thomas or

You have to examine whether or not that

belief is a religious belief, as opposed to a merely personal
belief.

And you run into the problem that Mr. Rehnquist sug­

gested in one of his early questions:

if you create that

exemption statutorily, you run into the problem of the con­
scientious objector cases and you perhaps have to interpret
the statutory exemption in such a way that it applies to every­
body whether it's a religious exemption or merely a deeply held

Do you think it is not clear in this case

QUESTION:

Well, a personal religious belief against

doing anything relating to making the weapons of war, direct
weapons of war?

11

MR. DAILY:

12

QUESTION:

Directly involved in it; yes, sir.
He backed that up by saying that making

13

steel alone, as he had previously, was not a barrier, and we

14

can only infer that he meant that some of that steel might go

15

into other purposes, and that he was only raising the question

It was not just a general appeal to con­

science in the abstract as in the hypothetical posed by

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it was specifically his membership and

7

adherence to the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses that he relied

8

on.

9
10

MR. DAILY:

I'm not sure that he relied on his

Jehovah's Witness beliefs, but on his beliefs.

11

QUESTION:

Well, is that true from the record, when

12

there is another Jehovah's Witness who is not upset by this

13

situation?
MR. DAILY:

14

That's the point I'm making.

It was

15

Mr. Thomas' beliefs and not necessarily Jehovah's Witness

16

beliefs.

17
18
19
20

QUESTION:

So it gets down to a matter of a personal

religious belief wholly apart from Jehovah's Witnesses?
MR. DAILY:

On the record in this case that's true.

I think if you'll notice in the reply brief by petitioner, it
is apparently a matter of conscience by individual Jehovah's

21

Witnesses rather -- there's a paragraph in the reply brief that
22
23

seems to indicate that individual Jehovah's Witnesses may examine
their own conscience and make their own determinations as to

24

whether or not to work in certain fields.

But it is not unrelated to the beliefs of

Jehovah's Witnesses, as a faith.
MR. DAILY:

On the record in this case, I don't know

that you can make that determination.
QUESTION:

I thought the record in that respect was

crystal clear, open to no possible doubt.
QUESTION.:

Well, it's a factor, I suppose, but the

8

fact that another Jehovah's Witness went the other way would

9

indicate it isn't a compelling factor.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

I don't believe --

Didn't the Supreme Court of Indiana say

the question was unclear as to why he quit?
MR. DAILY:

Examining the record in this case, the

13

Supreme Court in Indiana could not find a basis for finding

14

that this was a tenet.

QUESTION:

the Indiana Supreme Court to some extent.

QUESTION:

18

MR. DAILY:

19
20
21

22
23

That probably led to the 4-3 decision in

It was still 4-3.
Well, the minority in the Indiana Supreme

Court felt that Sherbert should be given broad application and
did not go into the facts.

So they thought that Sherbert

applied across the board, and therefore applied in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, the fact that some other employees

who were members of Jehovah's Witnesses did not take the same
view of the matter, there's nothing unique in that.

24

MR. DAILY:

That's so.

25

30

1

QUESTION:

Members of any given faith, whether

2

Catholic or Presbyterian or whatnot, have more liberal construc­

claim as a Jehovah's Witness adherent.
5

6
7
8

10

MR. DAILY:

I think that it is rooted in his claim

that his personal interpretation of the doctrine required him
to reach that decision.
QUESTION:

Is there anything in this record that

shows that any Jehovah's Witness is willing to work on a tank?
MR. DAILY:

There are a number of -- well, it is

QUESTION:

So that part of the Supreme Court decision

is plainly inconsistent with this Court's holding in Sherbert,
isn't that correct?

11

MR. DAILY:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Now, what was the third reason?

You didn't

13

get to the third, but the second one is, you agreed that we'd

14

have to modify Sherbert also to accept the second ground, so

15

I'm interested in -- what was it? -- I forget what the third

16

one was.

17
18

Of the Board?
Of the Board.
Well, they said, not only is it unclear

what his belief was but that it was unclear why he quit work.
MR. DAILY
QUESTION:

That goes perhaps farther than -Which is even different.

MR. DAILY

I think that would go further than I could

go on the facts in this case, at least that statement of their
holding.

They could -- the record clearly shows that he had,

that he quit work because he did not want to work on the tur­
rets, the tank turrets.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so.

It may be so that

he didn't want to work on the tank turrets but it would still be
a question of whether he quit because of
MR. DAILY:

That's true.

a

religious belief.

And I don't think that --

I think the Supreme Court of Indiana did not find any clear
statement as to whether or not that's why he quit.
I'd like to point to -- a minute -- to a fairly recent
case of this Court called TWA v. Hardison.

In that case this

Court said, "We will not readily construe a statute to require
an employer to discriminate against some employees in order to
enable others to celebrate their sabbath."
that to some extent modifies Sherbert.
thought that it did.

I am hopeful that

At least the dissent

And I think it does too, and I think the

basic principle in TWA v. Hardison is equality under the law.
Petitioner in this case -QUESTION:

Was Sherbert addressed to that kind of a

question?
MR. DAILY:

Sherbert was addressed to a state action.

This is an employer action involving a statutory mention of
religion which is the same thing that the petitioners want us tc
do here, create an exemption for religion.
36

I think the reasonir

is analogous, even though the factual situation is different.

This Court has frequently stated that the Court should allow
the legislature to assess the public need and should not strike
down a neutral state action within the state's power even if
that action approaches the verge or the limits of the power.
That's from Everson v. Board of Education.

The Court realizes

the potential conflict between establishment and freedom that

was realized in Walz v. Tax Commissioners.

noted in dissent in Welsh v. U. S., Congress or in this case

secular effect, should be stricken down.
I'm sorry.

Thank you.

Any further questions?

Apparently none.

Do you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. BLANCA BIANCHI de la TORRE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MRS. BIANCHI:

First we would like to address the con­

tention of the respondent that the Court of Appeals never said

6

there was there was a concession of no compelling state interest

7

and we would like to address the attention of the Court to pages

8

13(a) and 19(a) of our petition for certiorari where the Court

9

of Appeals clearly said that the task of applying Sherbert in

10

this case is focused by the Board's concession in oral argument

11

that'no compelling state interest exists in this case to justify

12

an infringement.

13

in oral argument.

14

So it is very clear, there was a concession

Second, the Board contends that in Sherbert there was

15

a discriminatory effect in relation to Sunday worshipers that

16

is not present in this case.

17

Sherbert was decided on First Amendment, not on the Fourteenth

18

Amendment equal protection provision.

19
20
21

22
23
24

The truth of the matter is that

Also, the interests now asserted by the State for the
first time before this Court in these proceedings were already
rejected in Sherbert like Justice Stevens pointed

--

And this

Court has stated that only the gravest abuses endangering para­
mount interests permit infringement on First Amendment rights.
Those grave abuses are not present in this case.
QUESTION:

Mrs. de la Torre, what if at the time that

25

38

1

your Mr. Thomas applied for work at the foundry he was told that
2
3
4

as a matter of company policy someone who is in the roll mill
automatically at the end of six months would be placed, rotated
to the tank production department?

5

6
7

MRS. BIANCHI:

That would be different from our case

because that would indicate knowledge on this petitioner that
that job was in conflict with his religious beliefs.

And I

8

have to admit that he could not accept that job and then allege

9

that his free exercise rights had been violated, because he had

10

knowledge.

11

that it wasn't until he was transferred to the tank turret line

12

that he realized the armament-producing nature of Blaw-Knox.

13

So he would not put himself in a position of having a conflict

14

with his religious beliefs.

15

But in this case he didn't.

QUESTION:

The Referee concluded

Also --

Could I ask you, suppose that his request

16

to the Jehovah's Witnesses had been answered by the religious

17

body saying, there's nothing contrary to our religion to work

prevent me from doing so.
MRS. BIANCHI:

We will still argue that the First

Amendment protects that belief because it's religious in
nature, it's sincerely held.
QUESTION:

As long as you say it's religion.

What if

he says, well, I just don't believe I should -- I just don't
39

believe in war.
MRS. BIANCHI:

Well, that is consistent with the tenet

of the Jehovah's Witnesses and would also be a belief protected
by the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

And you would say the same thing, then, if

6

a person went to his employer and said, I can't work in a turret

7

factory, I'm going to quit, and the employer said, well, why?

8

I have a religious belief.

9

religion are you a member of?

And his employer said, well, what
And he says, none except mine.

10

I'm a one-man, I have a one-man religion.

11

religious. I think it's contrary to the laws of God to go to

12

war or to even work on the implements of war.

13

in the same capacity --

MRS. BIANCHI:

And -- but it's

You would be here

Then we would have to urge this Court

to adopt the definition of religion in Seeger and Welsh, which
has not been extended to the First Amendment as of today.
QUESTION:
conscientious.

Well, no, he would say, this isn't just

I categorize my beliefs as religious.

MRS. BIANCHI:

Okay, then, we would have to look, as

I said, to the test of sincerity and religious nature and how
central this belief is to the life of this individual.

The

21

Court has often emphasized the centrality of the belief to de­
22

termine sincerity, and to that

effect

are the decisions

23

of the Court of Appeals in . Teterud v. Burns, 1979 decision, I
24

believe, and other decisions of lower federal courts.

QUESTION:

So you're close to conceding that all this

Jehovah's Witness business is irrelevant.

MRS. BIANCHI:

QUESTION:

For the precise issue here.

You are close

to conceding that the presence of a Jehovah's Witness connection
is irrelevant.

He'll prevail anyway.

MRS. BIANCHI:
10

Pardon?

The church --

He doesn't need the backing of the

well-known religious organization to come to this Court and

11

urge protection of his First Amendment rights, but in this case

12

that backing is persuasive as to the issue of sincerity and

13

is very crucial.

14

QUESTION:

but your response to Mr. Justice White was

that eliminating that you would still be here.

16

MRS. BIANCHI:

17

QUESTION:

18

20

21

Yes; yes, Mr. Justice.

What if he said, I'm an atheist but I'm

opposed to all wars?
MRS. BIANCHI:

Then I would have to urge this Court

to adopt the definition of religion in Seeger and Welsh.
QUESTION:

But these fallback positions do not alter

22

the fact that you have an organized established religion

23

declaring the belief on which he relies.

Yes, there is one.

MRS. BIANCHI:

brief, the Jehovah's Witnesses encourage their members to read
and study the Bible and get their own teachings from it.

It's

the practice that they do encourage and they have to come to
their own decision.

7
8

Well, as we indicate in our reply

QUESTION:

But some of them -- not all Jehovah's

Witnesses refuse to work in the turret factory.

9

MRS. BIANCHI:

10

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And at least some of them thought it was

11

wholly consistent with the tenets of the sect, or of the reli­

12

gion .
MRS. BIANCHI:

13
14

They did not view working there as

unscriptural, while Mr. Thomas did.
QUESTION:

15

But does that necessarily follow?

Suppos­

16

ing you had a Catholic nurse employed in a hospital and was

17

transferred into the abortion ward, and she said, well, it's

18

against my religion to work in abortions and then they defend

24
25

it on the grounds, well, some other Catholics will perform these
services, therefore your belief is not religious, is not sin­
cere .
MRS. BIANCHI:

I would say that the belief is reli­

gious in nature because she's saying that -QUESTION:

Some people are more religious than others

within the same faith, in other words.
42

MRS. BIANCHI:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, you have the further factor that in

the Roman Catholic faith you have an authoritarian determina­

tion of these issues and yet people are not excommunicated just
because they don't follow all of them.

6

MRS.

BIANCHI:

Well, we are submitting that the pres­

7

sure from the congregation is not a necessary element of a pro­

8

tected expression of religious belief.

9

QUESTION:

You agree that the group as a whole do not

10

11

in turret factories.

study the Scriptures and come to his own conclusions as to what

13

his religious belief should be.

14

MRS.

15

QUESTION:

They leave it up to each individual to

BIANCHI:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

So the fellow who works in the turret fac­

16

tory is acting just as consistently with the Jehovah's Witnesses

17

tenets as the fellow who doesn't.
