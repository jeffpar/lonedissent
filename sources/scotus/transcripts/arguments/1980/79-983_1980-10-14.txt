ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8
9

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

These consolidated cases are direct appeals by the

11

Government from the United States District Court for the

12

Northern District of Illinois which declared unconstitutional

13

four Acts of Congress that were passed in consecutive years

14

between 1976 and 1979 to hold down or eliminate annual cost-of-

15

living salary increases for all high-ranking federal officials,

16

including the Vice President, Members of Congress, Cabinet and

17

sub-Cabinet officials in the Executive Branch, and federal

18

j udges.

19

The District Judge held that to the extent these pay

20

freeze statutes applied to judges, they violated the compensa­

21

tion clause of Article III of the Constitution.

22

Court also held that as a matter of statutory construction the

23

statutes were not intended by Congress to be substantive legis­

24

lation.

25

federal officials' entitlement to a cost-of-living increase but

The District

That is, they were not intended to wipe out the

2

were instead only appropriations measures that refused to pro­
vide the money for salary increases required by law.

The

3

Government in these appeals has challenged each of these hold­

4

ings .

5

Before setting forth the facts that led to these law­

6

suits I think it would be helpful to begin by briefly explain­

7

ing the somewhat complicated mechanism by which the pay of

8

federal judges is determined.

9

Nation's history, judicial salaries were fixed by Congress

For the first 180 years of our

12

and raised the salaries of lower court judges on nine occa­

15

judges as well as the Vice President, Members of Congress,

16

Cabinet officers, and selected other high level officials are

17

reviewed by a blue ribbon commission every four years to

18

determine appropriate pay levels.

19

During this period Congress

Congress finally changed this system in 1967 by passing
Under this Act the salaries of federal

This commission reports its findings to the President

20

who must submit to Congress in his next budget message recom­

21

mendations for the exact rate of pay for these officials, and

22

23

President's recommendations.

24

review took place in fiscal year 1969 and the review process

25

The first federal salary act

has occurred every four years since then.
4

In fact, just last

1

week the membership of the fiscal 1981 review commission was

2

announced and that commission is scheduled to make its report

3

to the President on increases in judicial and other salaries

4

by the end of this calendar year.

5

Now, the Federal Salary Act contains no mechanism for

6

annual adjustments of salaries of the officials covered by that

7

Act.

8

modifying such salaries is the quadrennial review process.

9

an attempt to remedy this problem Congress in 1975 passed the

Rather, the only means specified in the Salary Act for

1 1

applies, by and large, to the officials covered by the

12

Federal Salary Act, including federal judges.

This Act

Now, under the Adjustment Act judicial salaries are

13
14

subject to an annual increase equal to the annual percentage

15

cost-of-living increase given to civil service employees in

16

that year, pursuant to yet another statute, the Federal Pay

17

Comparability Act of 1970.

18
19

20
21

22

25

Under the Comparability Act the

President each year must designate a pay agent to compare civil
service salaries with the rates of pay for the same levels of
work in private industry.

Following the study the pay agent

submits his report to the President along with a recommendatior
of appropriate adjustments in civil service rates of pay.
After considering this report the President has two

23
24

In

options.

First, he can inform Congress that he agrees with anc

adopts the agent's recommendation, in which event the
5

1

recommended cost-of-living increase automatically goes into

2

effect as of the first pay period after October 1st of that

3

year.

4

or economic conditions affecting the general welfare the

5

President believes that the pay agent's recommendations are

6

too high, the President may reject the pay agent's recommenda­

7

tion and submit an alternative pay raise plan to Congress.

8

If neither House of Congress disapproves the President's

9

alternative plan, it goes into effect on the first pay period

On the other hand, if because of a national emergency

10

after October 1st.

11

proves the President's alternative plan within 30 days, then th e

12

original recommendation of the pay agent goes into effect for

13

civil service employees.

However, if the House or the Senate disap­

And that can be downward as well as

upward ?
MR.

GELLER:

The President's recommendation could

conceivably be downwards, and generally it is downwards rather
than upward.
Now, as I mentioned earlier, the Adjustment Act ties
the cost-of-living increases of high-ranking federal officials
including federal judges to the average cost-of-living increase
given to civil servants under the Comparability Act.

In addi­

tion the Adjustment Act specifies the effective date of any
such adjustment for judges as of October 1st of each year.
So, to summarize, judicial pay is determined by

25

6

1

reference to three separate statutes.

2

Salary Act which sets a base pay for judges with a review of

3

that base every four years.

4

Act which provides that judges may get an annual cost-of-living

5

increase measured by the cost-of-living increase given to

6

civil service employees under the Comparability Act, and the

7

There is the Federal

10

was 1975, and in October, 1975, civil service salaries were in­

1 1

creased by an average of five percent pursuant to the Compara­

12

bility Act.

13

cials covered by the Adjustment Act received a like increase.

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, what was the basis of the

District Court's jurisdiction?

5

MR. GELLER:

6

QUESTION:

The Tucker Act.
Would the Government be in a better posi­

7

tion here if the Tucker Act had been repealed or never been

8

enacted?

9

MR. GELLER:

Well, there would be some question whe­

10

ther judges would have a right to sue because they're claiming

1 1

under the Compensation Clause of the Constitution.

12

for example, the Just Compensation Clause in the Fifth

13

Amendment might well require that Congress provide some judi­

14

cial remedy, but it's certainly not an issue in this case.

15

We have not challenged the District Court's jurisdiction.

16

It clearly falls under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2).

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Just like,

Now, in each of the next three years after 1976
Congress passed a separate pay act to limit or eliminate the
anticipated Adjustment Act increase for that year.

In July

1977 Congress passed the 1977 Pay Act which provided that the
cost-of-living increases that would have become effective in
October, 1977, "shall not take effect."
The reason Congress did this was because in March
of 1977 the officials covered by the Adjustment Act had
received their quadrennial salary Increase pursuant to the
8

1

Salary Act.

2

raise of almost 30 percent under the Salary Act in March, 1977.

3

and there was substantial sentiment in Congress that high-

4

ranking federal officials should not get two pay increases in

5

the course of a single year.
QUESTION:

MR. GELLER:

17

the 1977 legislation which wiped out —

QUESTION:

— what bearing did that have on the 4.8?

23

MR. GELLER:

That set a new base salary level for

24

judges.
25

QUESTION:

And in doing that did Congress supersede

whatever the increase was, the 4.8?
MR. GELLER:

Well, no.

The only bearing that the

4.8 percent has in this litigation now is, if appellees, are

5

correct that.

then the judges would be entitled to back pay for the period

from October 1, 1976.

What you're saying is, Congress meant to

eliminate that 4.8 in light of the 29 that became effective in
March, '77?
MR. GELLER:

Well, what Congress meant to eliminate

12

in light of the 30 percent increase judges got was the 7.2 per­

13

cent salary increase --

25

That's what I'm trying to get to.
Yes.
And it had no bearing on the 4.8?
Only in the sense that the base salary

had been paid.
QUESTION:

No, what I'm trying to get at is, did

Congress say anything in respect to the 29-point -- that it was to
supersede any of the 4.8?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

No.
All right.
But there are a number of statements in

the legislative history that talk about superseding the
10

1

7.2 percent that was going to become effective in October of

2

'77 because it would have been two salary increases in one

3

year.

4

QUESTION:

Well, then, you don't think, then, that

5

that quadrennial increase was effective to wipe out any en­

6

titlement to any prior cost-of-living increases?

7

MR. GELLER:

Well, it only became effective in

8

March, 1977.

What it does wipe out is any claim that judges

9

have to a new base salary level based on the 4.8 percent, but

10

what it doesn't wipe out is back pay for the period October 1,

11

1976, to March, 1977.

QUESTION:

Yes, all right; fine.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, let me get this clear.

You

did just say that the 4.8, in any event, in light of the 29

percent that became effective in March, '77, limited the 4.8

Well, your brief doesn't make this clear,

but it's — but that's wholly consistent with your position,

I must say.

MR. GELLER:

Just as if the current salary, the cur­

a new salary level for judges, presumably, unless the President

or Congress doesn't go along with the recommendations.

MR. GELLER:

2

QUESTION:

That's right.
All right.

Yet -- Mr. Geller, in review­

3

ing the fairly complicated statutory system under which judi­

4

cial salaries are determined, did you mention the basic stat-*

5

ute,

28 U.S.C.

6

Section 135?

MR. GELLER:

Well, that just- sets the base salary

7

for district judges.

8

9

135 . is

for.

There’s a separate statute that sets the

district

judges,

and

what

it

10

does is, it has two components.

1 1

you know, the Adjustment Act increase the base salaries, the

12

salary -QUESTION:

13

It says a base salary, plus,

"As adjusted, each.judge" -- and this is

14

the district judge -- "shall receive a salary at an annual

15

rate determined under the Federal Salary Act, as adjusted by

16

the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act."

QUESTION:

Right.

As I said, there are two com­
One is --

That is the statutory salary that a judge

receives.
MR. GELLER:

Well, that is the statute that sets

forth the components of a judge's salary and it refers to other1
statutes. It refers to the Federal Salary Act and it refers to
the Adjustment Act.
QUESTION:

It says, "Each judge shall receive"
13

1

that salary.

2

You didn't mention that, did you?

MR. GELLER:

Well, 1 don't

even

mention

that

because there's a separate statute for each branch of the

4

federal judiciary, and all it does is relate how all the

5

other statutes work.

6

8

QUESTION:

Well, that's all it does, but it does do

that.
MR. GELLER:

Yes. Well, there is a separate statute

9

in that event for each judge.

15

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

18

MR. GELLER:

20

22

24

25

And then there's a separate statute for

Circuit judges, Supreme Court Justices,

and for other parts of the federal judiciary.

17

19

That is the salary that a district judge

gets as provided in Section 135.

14

16

That language is mandatory, is it not?

But each one is similar, or is it?
That's right.

The language is similar.

Well, just to finish up the statement of facts, in September
of 1978 Congress eliminated a 5.5 percent pay raise for Adjust­
ment Act employees that would have gone into effect on
October 1st of that year.

And last year, on October 12, 1979,

Congress reduced the Adjustment Act increase for fiscal year
1980 from 12.9 percent to 5.5 percent.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, for a moment, on the
14

1

September 30, '78, statute, is that the only one of these

2

statutes in which Congress expressly limited the effect of the

3

statute to the then, to the year involved?

4

MR. GELLER:

5

QUESTION:

No -It says, "No part of the fund appropriated

6

hereby shall be used to pay salaries for this period -- . "

7

Is that language repeated in the other statutes or is it -- ?

8
9

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

Except for the -- it's repeated

in all of the statutes except in the 1977 statute which is not

10

part of an appropriations act at all and simply says that the

11

October, 1977, Adjustment Act increases shall not take effect.

QUESTION:

Each of the Acts by its terms applies

only to one year.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

That's right.

That's right.

Now, is that the Act that was signed by

the President late in the afternoon of October 1?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

No, I'm just talking about the 1979.
I know that.

I thought you mentioned

also the '77?
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

No, the '76 Act was signed on October 1st
And was signed but -- sometime later in

the day of October 1st?
MR. GELLER:

which I would hope to get to a little bit later of what the

QUESTION:

1 1

Well, Mr. Geller, as part of the facts --

12

I take it this is part of the facts -- on October 1, 1979, the

Government seems to agree, at least in its brief, that the

Yes.

And there's no question in this

MR. GELLER:

So that --

I understand.

Appellees representing the classes of

8

federal judges affected by these pay acts brought these actions

9

under the Tucker Act in February, 1978, and October, 1979.

10

The first suit which we've referred to as Will I challenged

1 1

The District Court agreed with appellees and

According to the District Court, once the Adjustment
Act became law in 1975, then the right to an annual cost of
living increase measured by the average cost-of-living adjust­
ment given to civil servants under the Comparability Act
became part of the judges' compensation which may never there­
after be diminished or eliminated.

Every currently sitting

immediate financial interest in the outcome of these cases

In these circumstances we believe the Court as it die

QUESTION:

If you were drawing a disqualification

things that you would consider, a case in which they were pass­

Yes, and it is, I think clearly within

Not only

1 1

do the Justices of this Court have a financial interest in the

outcome of these cases, but by virtue of the District Judge's

party to the litigation, which is a separate disqualifying

MR. GELLER:

My understanding is that when every

judge is disqualified from hearing a case, then no judge is
disqualified simply by virtue of the disqualifying factor.
20

1

I should add the obvious that if any Justice feels that he

can't personally sit on this case because he cannot be impar­

If all the members of this Court were dis­

It would depend, Mr. Chief Justice, on

why the Court decided that the members of this Court were dis­
qualified.

If the Court were to decide that the rule of neces­

sity has been abrogated and that every federal judge now on the
bench is equally disqualified and that no one can hear '
22

1

this case, then we think that the appropriate disposition would

2

be for this Court to vacate the judgment of the District Court

3

who was also equally disqualified.

4

5

QUESTION:

Well, if we're disqualified to sit, how

can we decide anything?
MR. GELLER:

6

Well, I think under the same rationale

7

that allows this Court to determine whether it has jurisdiction

8

or even in cases where the Court clearly doesn't have juris­

9

diction because the issue is moot.

For example, the Court

10

sometimes sends the case back to have the judgment vacated even

1 1

though technically the Court doesn't have jurisdiction.

12

Now, however, I should add that --

13

QUESTION:

14

You told us at the outset that this is not

a matter of jurisdiction, I thought?
MR. GELLER:

15

That's correct, and why I think I'm

16

consistent in saying that the Court would have the power to

17

send the case back to the District Court with instructions to

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

vacate that judgment.

It seems to us that if every judge is

disqualified there's no reason to leave that judgment out­
standing .
However, there's anothe possibility here which I
should mention, and that is, the Members of this Court may
feel that they are disqualified because they are parties to
this litigation.

Now, not every federal judge now on the

bench is a party to this litigation.

I'd like to turn, then, to the statutory basis for

the District Court's holding.

The court's statutory determina­

tion is extremely important for two reasons.

Court agrees with the District Court that the appellees had a

First, if this

10

statutory right to their cost-of-living increases over the past

11

four years, then there will be no need to reach the constitu­

12

tional issues raised by the Pay Acts.

13

Second, the district judge's statutory holding af­

14

fects a great many federal employees other than judges.

15

the District Court is correct as a matter of statutory con­

16

struction, then not only judges but about 2,000 other federal

17

employees covered by the Adjustment Act would have gotten

18

20

21

24

salary raises in each of the last four years.

If

And, in addi­

tion, some 20,000 civil servants whose pay is subject to a
statutory ceiling pegged to the lowest executive schedule
salary level would also be entitled to receive back pay, be­
cause the ceiling would have been raised in each of the last
four years.

These combined pay increases would total several

hundred million dollars.
In light of these two important considerations,

25

25

1

the District Court's treatment of the statutory issue is some­

2

what remarkable. The issue is discussed in a single paragraph

at the very end of its opinion in Will I.

states that none of the Pay Acts contains any language indi­

ORAL ARGUMENT BY KEVIN M. FORDE

1 1

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

12

MR. FORDE:

13

Your Honors, may it please the Court:

There won't be divided argument. We appreciate the

14

The point we —

I'm having a little difficulty hearing

you.
MR. FORDE:

I'm sorry, Justice Brennan.

The point that we desire to make and the explanation
that we think we owe the American people if not the Court in
an unusual case like this, a case brought by judges in federal
courts, is that it's their duty to bring such a case.

This

Court has said so in the O'Donoghue decisions and in other

38

1

cases.

2

such a duty upon the judiciary, and --

3

The American Bar Association canons of ethics impose

QUESTION:

What canon of ethics imposes a duty on

4

the judiciary to file a suit urging other judges to raise their

5

salary?
MR. FORCE:

6

Canon 1 of the American Bar Association

7

Canons of Judicial Ethics says it's the responsibility of a

8

judge to preserve the independence of the judiciary.

9

involves the independence of the judiciary.

This case

I think that -- and this raises exactly the point

10

1 1

that we attempt to make.

12

judges' pay, judges like Judges Campbell and Will, for example,

13

would not have filed a lawsuit in a federal court for the

14

comparatively few dollars that are involved in this case.

15

it in their opinion presents an issue of critical

16

tional moment that must be decided by this Court, because they

17

believe that if Congress can do this — at the time they filed

18

the suit it was only two years.

19

to do it again, and in fact their fears have been proven by

20

history.

While it's a case that does involve

Yet the Disqualification Act requires

MR. FORDE:

before the Court.

That's correct.

There's an exception

6

to the disqualification statute in the rule of necessity.

7

The rule of necessity — we agree fully with the Solicitor

8

General on this point -- the rule of necessity has been in

9

effect as long as know it.

We've cited cases in this Court in

these appeals.

13

no indication in the legislative history of this disqualifica­

tion statute or any other disqualification statute , that

15

Congress intended to change that.

16

We've cited cases and referred the Court to the
And as long as federal courts have

And, in fact, there is testimony in

There is

legislative

17

history before the Congress in adopting this disqualification

18

statute that they intended to preserve the rule of necessity.

19

So there is no question but that any judge, including the

20

judges of this Court, are disqualified in this appeal or that

21

the district judge or any other district or circuit judge is

22
23
24

25

disqualified from hearing these cases.
QUESTION:

Now, and what is the rule of necessity?

Briefly, it is that if every judge is disqualified, then
nobody is disqualified.

So I would read the

rule of necessity as applying if it's necessary to get a

QUESTION:

But in any event, in this case, every

federal judge is for one reason or two reasons disqualified?
MR.

FORDE:

There's no question about that.

And ther

is no other place -- wherever the case would be sent, there is
■41

1

no judge, even if he's appointed tomorrow, who wouldn't have

2

an interest in the outcome of this case.

3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but the language in Evans v. Gore,

5

which is relied on in the Court of Claims opinion and so forth,

6

was rendered at a time when the disqualification statute didn't

7

apply to Supreme Court Justices, so it was really dicta, wasn't

8

it?
MR. FORDE:

9

Well, it might have been dicta but it's

10

sound law.

The rule of necessity has been applied since 1300

11

or 1400.

12

just what the long established law is.

13

as dicta, then today is the time to decide that issue, which

14

has to be decided, and I submit has to be decided the way both

15

we and the Solicitor General suggest it must be decided.

And I think what the Evans Court was saying is

The result is chaos.

16

If you want to treat it

The contrary would be chaos.

17

The contrary would mean that if Congress passed a statute

18

tomorrow saying that all judges of this Court have to resign

19

in five years, there's no one who could challenge it.
QUESTION:

20
21

larly appealing either, is it?
MR. FORDE:

22
23
24

25

Well, the other result is not particu­

Oh, it's not appealing, but when you

look at the alternative it's not that difficult, in my judg­
ment.

The point I was starting to make is, we feel we owe

an explanation to the American people as to why federal judges
'42

1

sue in federal courts.

2

because there's no other place to go and they had an oath, we

3

felt, part of their oath of office, to bring the case.

I think you're in the same boat.

Well, in any event, in this case there's

no question about the fact that in this case, which is the

10

case you did bring, every federal judge in the United States

1 1

has got a financial interest.
MR. FORDE:

12

That's right.

I believe, then, I've

13

made the point why we felt this case had to be brought, why

14

the plaintiffs felt this case had to be brought.
I'd like next to address the arguments that are

15
16

raised.

17

disucssed is the contention of the Solicitor

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

The most important point, I think, that has to be
General and

the Department of Justice in these cases that a judge cannot
prove a violation of Article III, Section 1, without showing,
proving discrimination.

I guess this takes us to to where

the statutes are, what the Constitution provides.
The Constitution provides, in very unequivocal
terms, that a judge is to receive a compensation which shall
not be diminished.

Mr. Geller opened his comments by saying

that these were complex statutes.
46

These are about as simple

1

and unequivocal as statutes as appear on the books.

2

of them exceeds more than a few lines that are relevant here.

3

Section 135 provides a salary for a district judge.

4

guage of the other statutes for other judges are in the same

5

language.

6

Not a one

The lan­

One-thirty-five provides that a district judge shall

7

receive a salary at a rate determined under the Salary Act,

8

as has been discussed, as adjusted by the Adjustment Act.

9

The Salary Act, of course, is the provision for the quadrennial

10

raises on those few occasions that Congress permits them to go

1 1

ahead.

12

so that it requires an affirmative vote in both houses before

13

a raise can go into effect under the Salary Act.

And I might add that the system has now been changed

14

But the Adjustment Act, which is the principal act

15

at issue here, provides in very unequivocal terms -- and the

16

relevant portions are again about two lines long -- it provides

17

that for each fiscal year judges' salaries shall be adjusted

18

in an amount equal to the percentage adjustment granted

19

general schedule employees.

20

21
22
23
24

25

Incidentally, none of the statutes

that have been referred to that are intended to prevent that
adjustment, including the one adopted in July, 1977, ever men­
tion any intent to repeal or modify or amend the rights under
the Adjustment Act.
The Adjustment Act applies to all executive level
employees except with respect to judges.
'4 7

That section says,

1

it can never be downward.

2

whether the adjustment under the Comparability Act can be a

3

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FORDE:

6

downward adjustment.

7

There was a question earlier about

It can, as to other employees.
As to other employees, there can be a
As to judges, there never can be.

Until these cases were brought and until this recent

8

history by Congress, the Compensation Clause has always been

9

honored by Congress.

Even in the Great Depression when the

10

salaries of other federal employees were reduced and reduced

1 1

and reduced for good reason, Congress never tampered with

12

j udges' pay.
Now, there were income tax cases.

13

Atkins involved

14

a question of whether judges who were suffering from inflation

15

were entitled to an increase because they weren't receiving

16

compensation, in real dollars, the same as prior years.

17

But when it come to the basic salary statutes, 28 U.S.C. 135

18

and the prior statutes like that, Congress never made any

19

attempt to tamper with those statutes.

20

The only thing that came anywhere near it was the
21

Booth case, which we decided, and that was -- and there they
22
23
24

25

attempted

to cut the pay-.of a retired judge.

And the Depart­

ment of Justice said, in that case, a retired judge is not an
Article III judge.

This Court, the Supreme Court, the Court at

that time, decided that he was an Article III judge.
48

1

The Solicitor General in that case said, if he is an

2

Article III judge, we concede that his compensation may not be

3

cut — even in this time of depression.
QUESTION:

4

5

When you say compensation, then, you're

talking about United States dollars, in effect?
MR. FORDE:

6

No, in this case we are talking about

7

the salaries set by the salary acts, the Salary Act, the

8

Adjustment Act, and 28 U.S.C. Section 135 for judges.

MR. FORDE:

My understanding of the way that Act works -- for

example, this year, Justice White, they recommended 13 percent,
the President recommended nine.

If either house of Congress

rejected it within 30 days, the net effect would be the 13
percent would have gone into effect.
QUESTION:
MR. FORDE:

Well, that just can't be, can it?
I think that's the statute.

In discussing the discrimination argument, we left
off on the discussion of the Booth case. The Government is ar­

21

guing here essentially that judges have an equal protection
22

claim and all I can say on that point is, if you read the
23

debates, there is absolutely no question that the framers of
24

the Constitution were saying that a judge's pay may not
25

51

QUESTION:

Mr. Forde, if you take the view that the

right granted by the Adjustment Act to a future adjustment

Compensation Clause, does it follow that Congress would not

have the power to repeal the adjustment?

MR. FORDE:

No.

could repeal the Adjustment Act, but they would have to make a

Why does there have to be a forum for

every conceivable claim?
MR. FORDE:

Well, I don't think that the Founders of

the Constitution would have wasted all that time putting toge­
ther something, the Compensation Clause and Article III, which
was intended to have three branches of government, of equal
power and standing, if one branch could do nothing about en­
forcing it.

It just doesn't make sense.

Could Congress now amend 28 U.S'.C. 135 and say that the salary
of district judges shall be $55,000 per annum, which would not
be a reduction or $65,000 per annum, to sweep away any ques­

Just amend the present 28 U.S.C. 135 to so provide.

QUESTION:

I wonder if the analogy is perfect,

because even if one assumes that there is a statutory right to
an adjustment, which might be described as an increase, it seen|s
to me it does not necessarily follow, although it might, that
that right is an ingredient of compensation within the meaning
of the Constitution.

See, there are two things you have to

25

62

1

convince us of.

2

secondly, that that right is part of compensation within the

3

meaning of the Constitution.

4

labor union person has a right to an adjustment in his compen­

sation as a matter of contracts, but it wouldn't necessarily

follow that that right is part of the compensation covered

by Article III.

MR. FORDE:

You have to have a statutory right -QUESTION:

Is that right -- is it perfectly clear

1 1

24

Yes; oh, I think so.

I think that's a

component of -QUESTION:

Or is it a right to have your compensa­

tion changed in the future, which would be conceptually
quite different?
MR. FORDE:

No, I think that is a component of a

judge's salary and the Supreme Court of California agreed, and
the Supreme Court of Delaware agreed with that rationale.
So, I don't think that in our opinion that it's even debatable
that it's not a component of a judge's salary.
And I might go back to the decision of the Supreme
Court in the O'Donoghue case, where they said that they con­
demned in violation of Article III "all which by their

25

63

1

necessary operation in effect withhold or take from a judge

2

a part of what he has been promised for his services."

3

I think a judge going on the bench today reads the

4

Adjustment Act and thinks that that is something that he has

5

been promised for his services.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I'm not saying it didn't -- Congress

7

could promise a lot of things and they might default on theit

8

promises but it doesn't necessarily follow that every promise

9

they make to judges is "compensation" within the meaning of

10

the Constitution.

There is no question they made a promise

1 1

and they've not fulfilled their promise.

12

follows that, it doesn't necessaily follow -- it may -- it

13

doesn't necessarily follow that what they promised was com­

14

pensation .

But I don't think it

I think the answer, Justice Stevens, is anything that they
promise with respect to pay is a part of compensation.
QUESTION:

It's really not any different from a stat­

ute that simply said, the salary of a district judge shall be
$55,000 a year.

That's a promise; it's no more and no less.

MR. FORDE:
QUESTION:

That's a 'promise.
It's a promise that you'll receive at
64

least that for the rest of your judicial career.
MR. FORDE:

2

That's right.-

In fact, to take up on

3

what Justice Stewart just said, I'll give you an example from

4

the government's brief, Justice Stevens.

5

about the formula problem in this case, in the lower court and

6

in the opening briefs here.

7

the Government's problem with the concept of a future promise

was that, well, we don't know exactly what it is yet, because

9

we don't know what the formula is going to be.

At first we quibbled

14

law providing that judges are to receive a $9,000 increase

15

16
17

20
21

22
23
24

And so, for example, they said,

Congress passed the law and the President signed the

payable $3,000 March 1, 1981; $3,000 March 1, 1982; $3,000
March 1, 19 84 , that notes that is not an enforceable promise
under the compensation clause until that March 1 date.
Now this is directly applicable to what the Predident

18
19

Their problem is that it's a

attempted to do back in 1975, I think, when President Nixon
said he'd go along with the 25 percent recommendation of his
commission but he was going to make it payable in three install
ments.

A lot of judges resigned because Congress vetoed that

recommendation.

If they stayed, relying on the fact that

this year, this year, and this year they would get a reason­
able compensation, it would take a while.

In the remaining few minutes I'd like to make some
comment on the statutory arguments.

make It as clear as I can that we think it's imperative that

I don't think that that's what he argued.

MR. FORDE:

QUESTION:

9

MR. FORDE:

'77.

That's right.
What kept it from going into effect?
On July 12, 1977, the Congress adopted a

10

statute that says, adjust, ' that.: says pay increases that would

1 1

otherwise go into effect this year shall not take effect.

12
13

QUESTION:

Okay.

So that is different from the

quadrennial increases?

14

MR. FORDE:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FORDE:

Oh, you're right.
Exactly.

All right; thank you.

The quadrennial increases had nothing to

17

do with these adjustments. And with respect to that Act, I

18

think that Mr. Geller stated that it specifically said, in­

19

creases under the Adjustment Act shall not go into effect.

20

It did not.

21

I recall, and in fact, in none of the four years did any of

22

the statutes which purported to withhold these limitations did,

23
24

25

It did not refer to the Adjustment Act at all, as

not a one of them ever mentioned the Adjustment Act, not a one
of them ever stated anything about specifically repealing the
Adjustment Act or any other of the Pay Acts that we have been

discussing here this morning.

QUESTION:

Mr. Forde, just to understand your statu­

3

tory theory, if you prevail on what the Government refers to as

4

the 1977 Pay Act, that would mean that the quadrennial adjust­

5

ment for '77 was then increased by 7.1 percent, effective

6

October 1,

base as to which the 12-point-something percent for the next

8

two years applies?

QUESTION:

10

12

And that increased amount would then be the

MR. FORDE:

1 1

1977.

That's right.
So that it's necessary if we go through

if you win on all the. .statutory arguments, that you build
that 7.7 percent into the salary which is later increased.
MR. FORDE:

13

That's right.

We did that in an appendix

14

to our brief, too.

tation .

Everybody covered by the Executive

That's right, Your Honor.
With respect to the statutory arguments -- and so

long as the Act of July 12, 1977, is being discussed, I have
to acknowledge that that Act comes much closer to substantive
legislation than the others.

QUESTION:

That is the '76 Act?

The one that was

not an appropriations act?

MR. FORDE:

That's right.

The Act of July 12, 1977,

was not an appropriations act.

year ago.

intended to do.

Nobody said word one about repealing the

10

Adjustment Act.

All they were concerned about was taking

1 1

additional compensation.

The other three were

If you read the legislative history, as Mr. Geller

After the actions of Congress in each of those years,

12
13

in all:three of the years -- not '77, the President issued an

14

executive order saying the rates of pay for judges and

15

others -- Congressmen and others, are -- and if you read those

16

executive orders, we cited two in our briefs, there is a third

one for the third year, he shows the pay as adjusted.

18

then he has a footnote saying, funds are not available.
So he did not think in those years that Congress was

23
24

And

enacting substantive legislation.

The Comptroller General

didn't think that Congress was enacting substantive legisla­
tion.

Before they did it the first time the chairman of the

committee asked for an opinion by the Comptroller General and
the Comptroller General said, if you do it this way, you will
not be affecting the statutory rates of pay, you will only be

25

withholding funds.

You will not be eliminating the obligation
70

1

of the United States to pay the salary.

2

funds available to pay them at this time.

3

After having before them

You just will not have

-- after -- the Comptroller

4

General's opinion, they did it by just limiting the funds.

5

And nobody in the record said, we disagree with the opinion.

6

In other words, the Solicitor says, well, the Congress obvious

7

ly disagreed with the Comptroller General's opinion in that

8

regard, but nobody said they did.

9

The Office of Personnel Management issued a memoran­

10

dum last year saying, in their opinion the limitations did not

1 1

eliminate the statutory obligation of the United States to

12

pay the adjusted salary.

13

the statute books, I believe it's 5 U.S.C. 5332 -- list judges'

14

pay and Congressmen and others as adjusted.

You pick up the handbook, West Publishing Company

handbook that's on the desk of every district judge in the

country, if he opens up to 28 U.S. 135 today, he'll see in

there a footnote as to judges' salary, and the footnote says

that his pay is something substantially more than he's re­

First, let me begin by correcting a

The citations are in Footnote 3 of our reply

Second, although there was some equivocation in his

answers, I think that the salient point of the appellees'
argument was the answer that Mr.

Forde gave to Justice Stevens'

question, yes, if their argument is accepted, then Congress
could not repeal the Adjustment Act at all.

Although, I might

add, they do concede, as I think they have to, that Congress
could repeal either on a one year basis or permanently the
Comparability Act, which would leave judges in exactly the same
position as these Pay Acts have left them.

I think that shows

22

the technical nature of the arguments that appellees are making
23

here today.

QUESTION:

Well, it's not entirely technical.

to give them to judges too, whereas your view would allow them

just to take it out for judges and leave everybody else get a

QUESTION:

We don't say

Under your view, they could raise the

salaries of all government personnel except judges, under the
Comparability Act and the Adjustment Act.
MR. GELLER:

Well, clearly they could raise up all

12

the salaries under the Comparability Act and do as they've

13

done over the last four years and say, no one under the

14

Adjustment Act can get any raises.

clear -- under your view, as I understand it, Congress clearly

federal employees except judges.
MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Isn't that correct?

MR. GELLER:
two things.

Well, let's not --

Well, yes, but let me, let's not confuse

First, there's a question as to whether there's a

diminution at all.

We take the position --

You say that would

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

5

Well, I understand.

Right.

So long as Congress acts --

Article III doesn't apply; therefore,

they can do it.
MR. GELLER:

6

Exactly; that's right.

But once, of

7

course, if the Court disagrees with that argument and finds

8

that the salaries have been increased, then we don't contend

9

that Congress can discriminate against judges in reducing

10

salaries.
QUESTION:

11

I understand.

But your basic position is

12

that they could modify the legislation to say, all federal

13

personnel except judges shall get the benefit of the Adjustment

14

Act.

That's --

MR. GELLER:

Yes; if they act before the Adjustment

Act increases go into effect, we claim there hasn't been a dimi
nution in compensation.
QUESTION:

What if there never had been a Federal

Salary Act and it was simply set the way it had been 50 years
ago; Congress enacted a law saying the salary of a judge shall
be such and such, and in a particular year Congress increased
its own salary five-fold but left the judges exactly where
74

they were, it didn't reduce them at all?

No question that that would not violate

MR. GELLER:

Whether or not to increase judicial

salaries is a question that the framers explicitly decided to

Now, the Adjustment Act, we submit, creates

But there's no indication that in

passing the statute Congress intended to surrender its ultimate
authority granted by the framers of the Constitution to raise
or to refuse to raise salaries of all federal officials in­
cluding federal judges.
Indeed, we think the fact that the Congress that
passed the Adjustment Act was the very same Congress that less
than a year later passed the 1976 Pay Act, so I don't think
75

that they thought that by .trying to search Tor a better' mecha­
