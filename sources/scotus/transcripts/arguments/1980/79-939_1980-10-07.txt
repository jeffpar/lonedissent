ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS H. RODRIGUEZ

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This is an employment discrimination case.

It was

11

filed in the Federal District Court in Delaware by Mr. Ricks

12

alleging unlawful discrimination based on his national origin.
There really is a narrow question before the Court,

13
14

when does the statute of limitations period run on the two

15

statutes in issue?

16

the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 United States Code 1981.
QUESTION:

17
18
19

And those two statutes are Title VII of

Mr. Rodriguez, perhaps at the outset you

could clarify something that's confused me.

Both the parties

to this case seem to have agreed, when I read their briefs,
that the applicable limitation period is 180 days.

And then

20
the Government comes in and it says that the period is 300 days.

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

QUESTION:

Now the Government comes in here and says,

well, it's 300 days.

4
5

Yes.

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Their contention is that there was a

And that triggered the
Now, there are myriad

They go from one extreme of saying that if you

10

file anywhere you're entitled 300 days; that's one part of it.

11

The other end is that you must have a state filing which is

12

timely, which this was not.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

15

QUESTION:
state filing.

Delaware was 120 days.

So it wasn't a timely state filing?
It was not a timely state filing.

So it depends upon whether there was a

By "it depends upon" I mean the question of whe­

ther or not it's 180 days or 300 days.
or not there was a state filing.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

It depends upon whether

Is that it?

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I think

that is, I think that was the reasoning of the District Court
20

and of the 3rd Circuit.
21

QUESTION:

Well, don't we generally have a rule that

22

amicus curiae can't inject a new issue into the case that has
23

not been argued by the parties in the lower courts?
24

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

I think that is the ruling of this

25

4

1

Court, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
2

QUESTION:

3
4

Is that a rule of this Court?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

That was not raised in the District

Court or in the 3rd Circuit.

5

QUESTION:

6

What about plain error?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

That could be very true and that's

7

the reason I'm glad it was brought up here, Mr. Justice White,

8

because if it was plain error, then, very obviously, you must

9

rule on it.

But as I said, there seems to be no decision in the

10

lower courts concerning this, and in our particular case I

11

really don't think it makes that much of a difference.

12

be glad to cover that later but --

And I'd

13

QUESTION:

Could it be plain error?

14

QUESTION:

The Government amicus does think it makes

15

a difference.

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

16
17
18
19
20

So that injects another issue.
Mr. Justice Stewart, the District

Court decided that the date that triggered the statute of
limitations was June 26, 1974, the date of the terminal letter
to Mr. Ricks.

Now that, if you take back 300 days from April

28, 1975, the date of the filing, that would be back to July 2
of 1974.

So the District Court action of June 26, 1974, when

21

they said, that's when the statute, the last discriminatory act,
22
that would be on that date.

Also the date of denial of tenure csf

23

March 13, 1974, that would also be beyond that date.

So that's

24

the reason I say to the Court that in those circumstances
25

i

I really don't think it makes that much difference.

QUESTION:

which isn't governed at all by that, is it?

4

And you also have the '1981 claim here,

MR. RODRIGUEZ:
1977.

Yes.

That was filed on September 9,

So three years back under the -QUESTION:

In the District Court.

And that's a three-

year statute of limitations.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Yes.

It's three years under Delaware,

Delaware laws.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

The District Court chose the June 26,

12

1974 date, and that was the date that Mr. Ricks was notified

3

that he would receive a terminal contract, and dismissed both

4

actions under Title VII and also 1981 as being time-barred.

5

The 3rd Circuit took the date of the end of the terminal con­

6
7
8
9
20

tract, which was June 30, 1975.
QUESTION:

Is Mr. Ricks a United States citizen or not 7

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Is not.

The 3rd Circuit picked this

date and they laid down a law that is applicable in that circuit
to Title VII cases, to 1981 cases, which we feel is highly
undesirable and is not only contrary to law, prior decisions of

21

this Court. And their decision was that when the employee knows
22

or a reasonable person should know in his circumstances that his
23

employer is going to terminate him and -- and it's very impor­
24

tant because it's a two-part decision -- and he leaves the
25
6

1

2
3
4
5

service of his employer, then the statute starts to run.

And

that's the law in thd 3rd Circuit, and that's the reason for
our appeal.
Now, we feel it's contrary to the plain reading, the
plain language of Title VII.

Title VII sets out unlawful

6

employment acts and it sets those out as being compensation,

7

terms of employment, conditions and privileges, and it places

8

a time limitation and it says you must file within 180 days fron

9

the alleged unlawful act.

10

What the 3rd Circuit is doing is substituting for

11

that and it's saying, you can wait until you're terminated or

12

until you have a final decision to file.

13

QUESTION:

And it doesn't --

I was -- both the briefs of the parties and

14

the amicus briefs kind of talk about this as an all-or-nothing

15

situation, but it really depends, doesn't it, upon what the

16

complaint is, what the complaint is?

17

for wrongful discharge, based upon a person's national origin,

18
19

And if the complaint is

then the question is, when did the discharge occur?

If on the

other hand the claim is for a wrongful denial of tenure based
upon a person's national origin, the question is, when did the

20

denial of tenure take place?

You can't generalize it.

You have

21

to look at the complaint and see what the alleged discrimination
22

was, don't you?
23

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't believe

24

that's a holding.

I believe it can be read that way.

25

7

I hope it

1

will be read that way.

How do you read this complaint?

denial of tenure and termination.

QUESTION:

Well, then, insofar as he alleged that he

was terminated by reason of his national origin, then the ques­
tion is, when was he terminated,

11

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

12

QUESTION:

isn't it?

Yes, that's correct.

And if he alleges that he was denied tenure

3

on account of his national origin, then the question is, when

4

was he denied tenure?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

5

QUESTION:

Those two or --

And if he claims that he was denied a pro­

motion, when was he denied the promotion?
was he denied the job?

Or denied a job, when

You can't generalize about these things,

you have to look and see what the complaint is, don't you?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Let me discuss the facts of our par­

20

ticular case.

Under the tenure policy

in effect at the time

2

that Dr. Ricks was there

a denial of tenure for the second time,

22

which is exactly what took place, automatically results in a
23

terminal contract.

So it automatically results in his termina­

24

tion.

Now, he has a right to accept a one-year terminal

25

8

1

contract.

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Which he did.

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

And at the end of that

period of time --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

7

Which he did.

That was the end of the line.
— he was out of work, and -- but he

did not have to accept that, that was up to him.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

I understand that.
But what my argument is, that the

10

termination of his services is not the alleged unlawful act,

11

the denial of tenure is.
QUESTION:

12

But isn't that the question?

13

the dispositive question?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

QUESTION:

What is the alleged discriminatory

Whether it was a denial

Isn't that

a

of

hiring

or

a

promotion,

in this case a denial of tenure, and/or maybe of firing.

And

the question is to determine which, or maybe it's both.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

But the decision here, among other

20
things, flies straight in the face of the decision in the Evans
21

case, because in that case you had a stewardess who was denied
22
— their policy at that time was, an airline stewardess could
23

not be married.

If she married she had to resign.

That was

24

in 1968.

That was the unlawful act.

25

9

It was later to be held by

1

this Court to be unlawful.
2
3
4
5

She came back to work in 1972 and

she said, I'm now being denied seniority because I was termi­
nated in 1968 unlawfully.

And this Court held that that was a

past act, beyond the statutory period, the 1968 termination or
resignation has no present effect, and you must show a present

6

violation.

7

Dr. Ricks was denied tenure March 13, 1974.

8

all statutes of limitations, 1981, Title VII.

9
10

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

21
22
23

Isn't that different

Well, Evans -- Evans, she left --

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

It was continuing.

from the Evans case?

7
8

Yes, he does, Mr. Justice Marshall,

but --

5
6

He —

Doesn't he also allege that it was con­

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

3
4

That is barred by

tinuing up till the time he was let go?

11
12

Now, our argument here is exactly the same, that

The point I would like to make,

Mr. Justice Marshall, that as far as continuing is concerned,
Dr. Ricks does not say that our tenure policy, to which he was
subjected, is unconstitutional or discriminatory toward him.
And the same thing in the Evans case.
contend

The stewardess did not

that the seniority policy was discriminatory toward

24

her.

And Mr. Justice Stewart, you — the Court held in the

25

10

1

majority in that case that he had to have a present violation,
2
3
4
5

6

and there was no present violation.

And our contention here is

that there is no present violation.

There's a termination:

denial of tenure automatically results in a terminal contract.
So the day that he last worked has no significance under
Title VII.

7

QUESTION:

Well, it does have significance if the

8

basic claim is that he was fired by reason of his national

9

origin.

10

a

Then the question is, was he fired and when?

That's

the first question.

11

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Yes.

The first two questions.
Under the faculty policy which he was

14

subject to, when he was denied tenure on March 13, 1974, by the

15

Board of Trustees, that was a final act.

16

QUESTION:

Well, if his claim of alleged discrimina­

17

tion is that he was denied tenure, then the question becomes,

18

when was he denied tenure?

19

20
21
22
23

MR. RODRIGUEZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, he was denied tenure --

And the statute of limitations begins to

run from then.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:
QUESTION:

Very true, Justice Stewart.

If his claim is that he was wrongfully

discharged, then the question is, was he discharged, when, and
24

if you'd answer those two questions, then the statute of
25

11

1

limitations begins to run from the time he was discharged.
2

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

3
4

QUESTION:

7

So one must look to the complaint in every

case, isn't that true?

5
6

Our argument there --

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

I don't think so under the 3rd Circuit

opinion because it's an overall opinion.

As I read their

opinion in this case, Mr. Justice Stewart, you have to have,

8

number one, that he knows his employer's going to finally

9

terminate him.

That's the first test.

And, number two --

10

and one could come before two or two could come after one -- he

11

has to leave his employment.

12

is laid down in this case.
QUESTION:

13

And I think that's the rule that

Well, there can be violations of Title VII

14

by somebody who never leaves

15

violation might be a failure to promote.

16

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

17

QUESTION:

the

employment.

That's our very point.

And there could be violations of Title VII

18

by somebody who never becomes an employee.

19

be a failure to hire.

20

23

The violation might

So, you can't have a general rule, can

you?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

21

22

I mean, the

Well, I think the 3rd Circuit has put

out a general rule and that's our argument and I think that's
wrong.
QUESTION:

And that's what some of these amicus briefs

24

seem to have come in for.
25

12

1

MR. RODRIGUEZ:
2
3
4

7

It

says that he could have sued in 1973, or March 21 when he was
denied tenure for the first time; and he could have sued when
he was denied tenure for the second time.

5

6

And I think EEOC does say that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rodriguez, following up on Justice

Stewart's suggestion, it depends a little bit on the way the
complaint is written.

If we put to one side equitable relief,

8

an injunction requiring tenure, say, and just look at the damage

9

action, I suppose normally a cause of action doesn't accrue

10

until all the elements of the damage claimed are present.

11

And he didn't suffer any monetary damage until he stopped

12

working for the college, did he?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

13
14

No, that's very true, Mr. Justice

Stevens, but he took -QUESTION:

15

So wouldn't his damage claim have been

16

premature if he'd brought suit before, while they still had him

17

on the payroll?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

18
19

20
21

22
23

I don't think so because his rights

were terminated once the Board of Trustees denied tenure to him.
And he knew that under the faculty policy, under the AAUP
policy.
QUESTION:

But then he could have sued for an injunc­

tion, I suppose, a grant .retenure, but he couldn't have
recovered any money, could he?

24

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Well, I think he could have gone in

25

at that time and sued for a damage claim because -13

1
2
3

QUESTION:

Say he sued and 30 days later the case

came on for trial, he wouldn't go to judgment, would he?
He's still working.

4

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

No, his contract -- see, he was unem­

5

ployed as of June 30, 1974,

6

terminal contract.

7

the AAUP regulations.

17
18
19

Well, yes.

And so, if he brought suit on

But he knew that that terminal contract

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Yes, he knew that that was -- June 30,

1975, he was done work.
QUESTION:

15
16

It was his decision to take that terminal

13
14

See, that had to be offered to him under

January 1, 1975, say, he was still on the payroll.

11

had he not decided to take the

If he had -- knew it too, that would have

been admitted or conceded or stipulated in any action for
damages.
QUESTION:

He would have been

suing for anticipatory

breach, in effect, future damages.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Mr. Justice Stewart, the problem that

20

you brought up is a problem we're concerned with.

Denial of

21

promotion is an unlawful act.

Now that could, under the opinion

22

of the 3rd Circuit, that could occur five years -- say in 1975,
23

and under their reasoning, the employee could wait until he's
24

terminated and then he could bring that as an unlawful act.
25

14

1

And that's the thing that disturbs us.

2
3

QUESTION:
possibly meant that?

4
5
6

Well, do you suppose the Court of Appeals

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

That's the reading.

They

quoted

from Bonham, another 3rd Circuit opinion, and they quoted that
very explicitly, and it seems to me --

7

QUESTION:

If the alleged discriminatory act is a

8

failure to promote, based upon somebody's race, sex, or national

9

origin, then that's the act, and it becomes important to deter­

10

mine, first, did that act occur?

11

And then the statute of limitations runs and then if you find

12

that it is within the statute, then you consider the merits of

3

the claim.

4

with termination.

5
6
7
8
9

Secondly, when did it occur?

But it has -- that alleged act has nothing to do

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

No, I certainly agree, but I don't

think that's the holding of the 3rd Circuit.

I read, or I'd

be happy to read their holding again, and they quoted from
Bonham, which was an age and discrimination act.

But this Court

has said that the time limitation should be construed similarly.
QUESTION:

And

how

about

a

failure to hire?

20
You couldn't possibly say that the statute of limitations begins
21

to run when the person was fired if he was never hired.
22
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Well, that would not activate the

23

Ricks decision, because there was no employment.

They're just

24

saying, in employment termination cases where the employee
25

15

1

actually leaves the employer.
2
3
4
5
6

statute starts to run.
QUESTION:

Well, that is the date when the statute

starts to run if the alleged discrimination occurred at the
time of the firing, if he allegedly was fired because he or she,
the plaintiff —

7

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

11

But that is the date when the

Yes, there can be no doubt about it.

-- of a certain sex or a certain race or a

certain ethnic origin.

But if that's not the gravamen of the

complaint, then that that's not where the statute begins to run.
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Another example, Mr. Justice, I'd like

12

to bring out is the denial of seniority.

13

tory denial of seniority while one is employed is also a dis­

14

criminatory act and it could be sued upon when that occurs.

15

Now, if that employee does not sue under the 3rd Circuit rules,

16

does not bring an EEOC action and then, say, three or four

17

years later they have a RIFing policy because of decrease in

18

work force and because he was denied that promotion he doesn't

19

make it and his seniority, those people having his seniority

20
21
22
23

That is a discrimina­

are terminated, then according to the 3rd Circuit, he can bring
that. And it leads to stale claims and everything that this
Court has said should not occur under the statute of limitations
and under Title VII.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rodriguez, procedurally this case was

24

dismissed by and not tried by the District Court, was it not?
25

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

And then on an appeal with 3rd Cir­

cuit that court reversed?

4

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

5

Yes.

Under Rule 12(b)(6).i.c ,

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Do you think that the complaint stated a

claim both for denial of a contract to teach and tenure?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

QUESTION:

You mean there would have been, in his

mind, there would have been a violation even if tenure was

legally denied?
21

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

No, I think not, Mr. Justice White,

22

because he thought that tenure was legally denied; then that
23

automatically led to termination.

QUESTION:

So there's

not two separate violations?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

I don't believe so.

He consid-

No.

Well, did he say there were two?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:
were two.

He

that

Dr. Ricks said there

That's what he surmised from the complaint.

And I

6

think that's the reason that he picked the June 26, 1974, date,

7

because as of that time Dr. Ricks had been denied tenure, which

8

occurred by the Board of Trustees on March 13, 1974, and the

9

significance of the June 26, 1974, date is a letter from the

10

Board President indicating that he would be offered a terminal

11

contract.

But when were his appeal rights exhausted

The June date would have

If you take 180 days, it would have been

That's taking 180 days under the Title VII

If you take 300 days, it would have been July 2, 1974.

So the June 26 date of 1974 is valid either under the 300 days
or the 180 days.
QUESTION:

Was there a timely filing with the state

agency here?
24

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

It depends, Justice Rehnquist, on what

25

18

1

you call timely filing.
2
3
4
5

It was 120 days, a maximum.

So that it

was not a timely filing for the June 26, 1974, act that Judge
Stapleton considered significant.

There was a final -- Dr.

Ricks grieved, filed grievance proceedings in May of 1974, and
one of the things that he grieved was denial of tenure.

The

6

Grievance Committee reached a final decision on September 12,

7

1974.

8

your opinion in Electrical Workers that a grievance procedure

9

does not toll the statute under Title VII.

And our argument there is that this Court has held by

And the reasoning

10

there was that the Congress did not provide for such a tolling

11

and there are really two separate actions, the grievance pro­

12

cedure is contractual, Title VII is an Act of Congress.

13

that's our argument there for saying that the September 12,

14

1974, date is merely a decision on the grievance procedure.

And

We feel that the decision is directly contrary to the

15
16

purpose and intent of the statute of limitations, that if you

17

permit someone to sue when they know they're going to be termi-

18
19
20

ated, finally or when they do leave employment, that that vio­
lates the whole purpose and intent of the statute of limita­
tions .
It's very pertinent in

this

because

the

statute is to prevent stale claims, to allow you to have wit­

There are time limitations throughout.

If no agreement is reached by EEOC in the conciliation agreement
then the employee may file suit and the district court is asked
in the statute to assign a judge to the case and to expedite
the case with all due speed.

7

We think it's also very contrary to practical con­

siderations.

what's going to happen.

It leaves the employer in a state of not knowing
He can have a termination four or five

10

years from the date that it occurred, which could be promotion,

denial of promotion, and then under the 3rd Circuit ruling suit

could be brought at that time.

in doubt.

No, I don't think so, Justice

It depends on when you take the date of the last

discriminatory act.

If you take it as far as we're concerned

and we agree that it should be at the very latest, June 26,
1974, when Ricks was notified of his terminal contract, then
that's the last discriminatory act.
20

I think our argument would even take it back in time

to March 13, 1974, when that decision to deny tenure became
final.

4

7

QUESTION:

Well, if the claim can be read as one that

the plaintiff was unlawfully terminated from his employment by
reason of his national origin, then he might prevail, because
the statute of limitations would then begin to run at the time

8

he was terminated from his employment, and if he can show that

9

the reason he was terminated was because of his national origin,

10

then he might prevail under Title VII, quite apart from 1981.

11
12
3

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, our argu­

ment there is that he was terminated once tenure was denied
because he -QUESTION:

4

No, I thought your argument was that the

5

only discriminatory act fairly alleged is a failure to give him

6

tenure ?
MR. RODRIGUEZ:

7

Yes, that's very true, but under the

8

policy, once he was denied tenure for the second time, he was

9

automatically offered a terminal contract.

20

denial of tenure was the act.
QUESTION:

21
22
23
24

That was the act,

Yes, but as I say, his claim is -- and if

he can prevail on it -- that he was terminated by reason of his
national origin, then he might win, although Judge Higginbotham
of the 3rd Circuit says that his claim was that he was denied
tenure.

Now, if the claim can be shown to be one of unlawful

25

21

1

termination by reason of national origin, then the statute of
2

limitations begins to run at the time of termination, doesn't
it?

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

We disagree with that, very respect­

QUESTION:

Well, you disagree with that characteriza­

tion of the claim --

8

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- but if the claim can be fairly so char­

10

acterized, then he, as my brother Rehnquist suggested in his

11

question, he might prevail for a reason other than the broad

12

reasoning of Judge Higginbotham for the 3rd Circuit.

13

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Yes, sir.

But under the faculty

14

regulations, Mr. Justice, he knew that the second time he was

15

denied tenure, that he would no longer be employed by the

16

college, and our argument is that that, if there was an alleged

17

discriminatory act, it occurred then, because that sealed --

MR. RODRIGUEZ:

Yes.

That sealed his fate, at that

point.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if his claim is that he was

wrongfully terminated by reason of his national origin, then the
merits would be whether or not that was correct.

Doesn't that beg the question?

I think it does, Mr. Justice Stevens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS JUDITH E. HARRIS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MISS HARRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

5

I'd like to begin by answering a question posed by

6

Justice Stewart concerning what it is that Dr. Ricks is claiming

7

in his complaint.

8

ing of his complaint indicates that he is claiming that his

9

discharge is discriminatory for reasons of national origin.

He is claiming that, and I think a fair read­

QUESTION:

10

11

fair reading, is it?

12

read.

It's a little hard to -- maybe it is a
I find the complaint a little hard to

13

MISS HARRIS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18
19

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

I find the complaint a little hard to read

either your way or any other way,

frankly,

so

maybe it was

a very fair reading.
MISS HARRIS:

Well, the complaint was framed with a

multiplicity of issues, and sometimes that creates problems
that one couldn't foresee until hindsight.
At any rate, he is claiming that his discharge was

20

discriminatory and he's claiming it both ways.

He's claiming

21

that the ultimate discharge of him on June 30, 1975, was dis­
22

criminatory.

He's also claiming that his discharge was caused

23

by the tenure denial and that the discharge was discriminatory
24

and that that process, that discriminatory process of the denial
25

25

1

of tenure caused a discriminatory discharge.
2

it from both ways, and I want to make that clear.

3
4
5

So he's going at

QUESTION:

Does he claim that the discharge was dis­

criminatory for any other reason than that the tenure denial
was discriminatory?

6

MISS HARRIS:

That remains to be proved.

I would say

7

a fair reading of the complaint says, yes; that he is alleging

8

the discharge as a separate violation, separate discriminatory

9

act.

One of the problems obviously with this case is it's been

10

ruled on on the pleadings alone.

11

forth his proof as to whether the discharge itself was discrim­

12

inatory, whether he was discharged in a manner in which those

13

who were not of his national origin were not discharged.
QUESTION:

14
15

18
19

20

Even though they too had been denied

tenure?
MISS HARRIS:

16
17

I think he is entitled to put

tenure.

Even though they too had been denied

That's correct; yes.
QUESTION:

Did the Court of Appeals read the complaint

as you have outlined it?
MISS HARRIS:

The Court of Appeals focused on the

process of, focused on his discharge and said it occurred on the
21

last day that he worked, and said that what he was complaining
22
23

about overall was the process which resulted in that, and said
that that was a continuing, ongoing process.

It's not clear

24

which acts they picked out as being part of that process but
25

26

1

2
3
4

they looked at the period from June 26, 1974, to June 30, 1975,
when he ceased working, as being a period in which that process
was ongoing and resulted in the termination of his employment
on 6-30-75.

Well, a lot of this is, or most of it is

irrelevant, if you are correct on this 300-day submission.

The respondent filed a supplemental

brief after the Mohasco case came down.

In that case, the Court

will recall that no filing could occur with EEOC until there
had been, where there was a state agency that had a local law
prohibiting discrimination; that no filing could occur with

EEOC until the state had been given the opportunity to look at
21

that charge, and that the time limits were either 60 days after

the state had received the filing or 30 days after the termina­

Do you think that Mohasco included an un­

I believe it did.

I believe Footnote IS

in Mohasco, I believe it's Footnote 19, speaks to that issue
when it talks about whether or not charge has to be filed withir

6

7

Publishing Company, I believe.

8

clearly that it doesn't have to be filed within 180 days, and

9

it suggests in that footnote that the charge doesn't have to be

11

It makes specific reference to Olson v. Rembrandt
But it doesn't say -- it says

I would also like to point out, Justice Rehnquist,

12

that there's some question as to whether Dr. Ricks's charge was

13

untimely with the state.

14

was to waive jurisdiction over to the EEOC, and I'd submit that

15

the waiver of jurisdiction, inherent in that waiver is the power

16

to review the charge.

17

tion, it didn't dismiss the charge as an untimely charge.

18
19

20

What the state did with that charge

The state assumed that it had jurisdic­

Clearly that was not the case.

What it did was, it simply

waived over to the EEOC.
So that if you pick up on the Mohasco theory, it seems
to me that you can count that 300 days from the point at which,

21

the earliest point at which Dr. Ricks could have filed his
22

charge with the EEOC.

That date would have been April 28, 1975.

23

You count back 300 days, there are a number of acts that
24

occurred, that in and of themselves might, would be timely.
25

28

1

You go back to July 2, 1974.
2
3
4
5

Clearly the notice of nonrenewal

on 6-26-74 would not be included, but, as in the supplemental
brief, I indicated the contract that was referred to in that
notice was signed by the College President on behalf of the
College on August 16, 1974, and it was executed by Dr. Ricks on

6

September 3, 1974.

7

period, if you assume the Mohasco reading.

8
9

Those two dates are within the 300-day

In addition, the College issued to Dr. Ricks a notice
that tenure had in fact been denied.

After the review of the

10

educational policy decision, the Board had decided to deny him

11

tenure and that notice was issued on September 12, 1974.

12

Again, for purposes of Title VII, if you assume the Mohasco

13

treatment of the case and the 300 days applies, that September

14

12, 1974, date is within the 300-day period.

15

that it's within the three-year period for purposes of Section

16

1981.

17

of Appeals held that it was a three-year Delaware statute of liir l-

18

tations that applied to the 19 81 claim, that the Court complaint

19

was filed on September 9, 1977, and if you go back three years

20
21

22
23

I might also add

We both agree, and both the District Court and the Court

to September 9, 1974, clearly the college issued its letter on
September 12,

'74, and that period is within the three-year

period.

12

tiary matter.

3

QUESTION:

Miss Harris, before you go on, could we

4

come back to the complaint for a minute or two?

5

the charge was related solely to the denial of tenure.

6

I understand that you are saying that actually the denial was

7

based on an unlawful discharge.

8
9
20

MISS HARRIS:

I had thought
Then, if

Is that correct?

The charge of discrimination filed by

Dr. Ricks before the EEOC and which is a part of this record
alleges a discriminatory discharge from his employment.
QUESTION:

I appreciate that the complaint is long

21

and perhaps not as clear as it might be.

Could you identify the

22

paragraphs in the complaint that do not relate to tenure and
23

specifically aver a discharge?
24

MISS HARRIS:

Paragraph 48, Justice Powell, I believe,

is the paragraph that does that -- paragraph 48.

MISS HARRIS:

them are -- I think 48 is the last one, are alleged to be dis­
criminatory and in violation of Section 1981.

And that would

include the discriminatory discharge.
QUESTION:

Apart from that, there’s no specific aver­

ment of discriminatory discharge?

10

11

The count two of the complaint says

that all the allegations numbered 1 through -- however many of

8
9

It says he was discharged.

MISS HARRIS:

That said that -- some allegations

separate and apart from the tenure?
QUESTION:

12

Yes.

There are 15 or 16 paragraphs that

3

talk about tenure, so I was under the impression until this

4

morning that your contention was based on the denial of tenure,

5

but I’ll take another look at it.
MISS HARRIS:

6

I think a fair reading of the complaint

7

is that most of the allegations do go to tenure; yes, that's

8

correct.

9

20
21

22
23

There are no allegations separate and apart from those

other than that one paragraph 48 that talks about discriminatory
discharge.
QUESTION:

Would respondent have remained on the

faculty without tenure?
MISS HARRIS:

That's a question that would remain to

be proved, and it is a question at this point.

I think that the

24

College has taken the position that because he was awarded a
25

31

1

2
3
4

terminal contract, he would automatically leave.

I think the

complaint alleges, and if allowed to be put to the proof,
Dr. Ricks would attempt to show that he had been previously
denied tenure and although under the College regulations that

5

previous denial of tenure required the issuance of a terminal

6

contract and certain treatment prescribed in the College's

7

regulations, that did not in fact occur.

8

case, I think it remains a question as to whether he would have

9

automatically ceased to be employed with the College simply

because he was awarded what's called the terminal contract.

QUESTION:

So that would mean that he would not be

working for the university after the end of that terminal
contract ?

11

MISS HARRIS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MISS HARRIS:

Well, I think that --

I mean, otherwise it isn't terminal?
That's correct.

I don't think, though,

14

that the issuance of the contract necessarily meant that he

15

would not be working there after June 30, 1975, and I say that -

MISS HARRIS:

What does terminal mean?
That's what it ordinarily means but I

would say, Justice White, that the -QUESTION:

Doesn't it suggest that although in other

circumstances you might have had another one year contract
issued to you after this one, you won't be issued another one
after this one?

22
MISS HARRIS:

Well, what the notice, the June 26

was that, we're issuing you this contract to comply with the

ated as to whether he would remain on the faculty.

Well, not if they -- the only condition on

the letter was if the Board of Trustees granted him tenure.

So I think

that by the very issuance of that letter the question was cre­

However, if the Board of Trustees decides to

MISS HARRIS:

That's correct.

And by September 12,

'74, that had happened.

9

QUESTION:

Is this in your view just a traditional

10

method of giving the faculty member a year's time to find new

11

employment, and a year's notice, in effect, that at the end of

12

the year there would be no more employment at this institution?

13

Is that what it amounts to?
MISS HARRIS:

The issuance of a terminal contract,

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20
21

— Yes, it is.

I think it's a very common

Is it fundamentally any different from

ordinary workers in industry that might get 15-day or 30-day
notice that their employment is terminated, but they have the
employment during that 15 or 30-day period?

Is it essentially

the same in operation?
MISS HARRIS:

It may be, depending on why the notice

22
23

was given.
QUESTION:

Well, if it's either a layoff or for cause,

24

whatever, is that not the function of it, to give the person a

Now, in your view, the statute of limita­

tions is not tolled until the end of the notice period rather

than the beginning of the notice period.

11

Yes, that's

correct.

MISS HARRIS:
he ceases to work.

Yes.

Isn't that the essence

The end of -- the point at which

In this case it was the end of the notice

period.
QUESTION:

Not the point of termination of the con­

12

tractual relationship?

13

MISS HARRIS:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That is my position.

Getting back to Justice Powell's question,

15

it seems to be clear, at least in the first sentence of Judge

16

Higginbotham's opinion for the Court of Appeals for the 3rd

17

Circuit that that court considered your complaint to allege a

18

discriminatory denial of tenure.

19
20
21

22
23

And "denial of tenure," that

ends the sentence, first sentence of the opinion, doesn't it?
MISS HARRIS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Then he goes on, the opinion goes on at

some length to talk about the whole history and then ending up
with the termination, and then holding, as we know it held,
as to when the statute of limitations began.

24

MISS HARRIS:

That's correct.

25

36

1

QUESTION:

But the question is still whether it was

2

180 days or 300-day statute.
3

MISS HARRIS:
4
5

QUESTION:

That question does remain.

And the Court of Appeals assumed it was

180 days?

6

MISS HARRIS:

7

QUESTION:

That's right.

Both parties assumed it was 180 days.

Now

8

there seems to be a possibility that it was a 300-day statute.

9

Should we remand it to the Court of Appeals to decide that

10

question?

11

upon whether or not there was a filing in the state, with the

12

state commission.

dressed by this Court on several occasions before and I believe
that in the context of Title VII as well as in the Age Discrimi­
nation in Employment Act this Court has held and courts below
have held that discharge occurs on the last day of work.

6

I think that that's what happened in I.U.E. vs. Robbins S

Myers, where the question was whether a grievance procedure

tolled the Title VII time limitation.

9

held that the time for filing the charge ran from the last day

the point of discharge is the point at which an employee ceases
to work.

And I think that if the Court decides this case dif­

ferently and decides that the June 26, '74, date is the date at
which discharge occurred or the violation occurred, that it will
be carving out an exception either for academic institutions or
perhaps for institutions that choose to give employees notice

24

of the fact that their employment is coming to an end.
25

38

1

2

I think a better rule is the rule of the employee’s
remaining on the job and the point at which the work terminates,
that that’s a point from which violation of termination or dis­
charge can properly be alleged.

I think there's no prejudice

5

suffered by an employer in this situation because employers

6

naturally maintain records of employees that they have on the

7

rolls.

8

you're talking about the termination of employment, they can

They can defend.

The claim really isn't stale.

If

they only have to defend up to either 180 days or, if this

12

the claim really isn't stale.

13
14

18
19

Attention's been called to the fact that two of the
witnesses are unavailable.

One of them is deceased -- one died

during the course of the appeal, not during the course of the
proceeding in the trial court.
QUESTION:

But, Miss Harris, supposing that it was

agreed that your sole claim was denial of tenure and not denial
of a contract to work, and that the university policy was to
give the faculty member who had been finally denied tenure a

20

five-year contract of employment and tell him that that was the
21

terminal contract.

Then you really would run into problems of

22

disappearance of witnesses and that sort of thing if you took
23

the date of -- the last date of employment rather than the date
24

on which the discriminatory denial of tenure became final,
25

wouldn't you?
39

1

MISS HARRIS:
2
3
4
5

That problem might be created but what

colleges could do in response to that is simply maintain the
records.

The witnesses might disappear and they might die but

it seems to me that the records of the tenure process and the
denial of it and the reasons for it could be maintained in the

6

college archives or in the college records,

7

of the college's position that denial of tenure was appropriate.

QUESTION:

Might there not be considerable evidence

MISS HARRIS:

That could be.

say that that's possible but it might be possible for colleges

13

to simply hold their proceedings as they did here in the Educa­

QUESTION:

There were transcripts of a hearing

Your positions apparently equate the exis­

tence of a contract with the execution of it.

That is, you're

placing the statute to running date from the last day of work
as distinguished from the notice of termination of the contract.
That wipes out the significance of the notice, does it not?
MISS HARRIS:

I believe it does.

I believe that the

violation, the ultimate termination of Dr. Ricks, was a dis­
criminatory act.

24

QUESTION:

But haven't the rights -- whatever the

25

40

1

right is, hasn't it been violated as soon as the notice is giver

that the contract is terminated, even though the work may con­

gested, a number of years?
5

7

9

MISS HARRIS:

It could very well be that the right was

violated then, but it doesn't necessarily follow that it was.
It could very well be that the giving of notice was a discrimi­
natory act and that notice was not given under similar circum­
stances to those people who were not of Dr. Ricks's national

10

origin.

11

in those circumstances.

12

It may very well be that notice was given to everyone

QUESTION:

On the other hand --

Isn't that a little difficult to square

3

with the general idea of staleness in the prosecution of claims?

4

Take the five-year illustration that was suggested hypotheti­

cally by Justice Rehnquist.

7

actual work, is it not?
MISS HARRIS:

8
9

20
21

22
23
24
25

It's a pretty stale claim if the

I don't believe so, if the allegation

is that the discharge, the ultimate act of terminating the
employee on the day he or she last worked is the discriminatory
conduct.

It might very well be that the giving of notice is,

or some event that occurred in any of those five years, but that,
it seems to me, goes to what issues or what claims the Court's
going to give relief on, versus whether or not the Court -- the
party is properly in court to assert some of that claim.

MISS HARRIS:

Isn't that a little bit unusual, though, for

24

the person to be able to file the charge even before a

limitations period begins?

2
MISS HARRIS:

I don't think so.

I think it happened

in Noble vs. Rochester, a 2nd Circuit case, and I think it
4

happened in Egelston vs. State University at Geneseo.
5

precisely what happened.

That's

Two charging parties filed their

charges with EEOC in anticipation of the discriminatory act taking
place.

They knew they'd been -- in one instance removed from

a position and asked to train someone else, and the court found

9

in that case that the time really started to run from the point

at which that person assumed the job.

The rationale of the 3rd Circuit?

Yes,

I am.
QUESTION:

Well, this Court of Appeals said the dis­

criminatory act was a continuing one.
MISS HARRIS:

No, it said the process of termination

was a continuing process.
QUESTION:
did it begin?

All right, but it was a process.

And when

When did the process begin?

MISS HARRIS:
QUESTION:

'74.

So the charge was filed after that?

MISS HARRIS:
QUESTION:

It said it began on June 26,

That's correct.

Miss Harris, for purposes of statute of iimi

tations analysis, is there any difference in your view between
43

1
2
3
4
5

the discriminatory act denying tenure and a discriminatory act
denying seniority, or refusing to grant some special, better
seniority?

If there's not, it seems to me that under the 3rd

Circuit rationale you might have a case arguably in which there
was a clear proof of discriminatory denial of seniority, say,

6

in 1974, resulting in an early discharge in 1990, with nothing

7

happening in between.

8

that the 1990 claim would be timely.

9

And under that rationale, it seems to me

MISS HARRIS:

Do I misread the opinion?

No, I don't believe a 1990 claim would

10

be timely if there's no difference between the discriminatory

11

denial of seniority and tenure.

12

the same but I don't think the 1990 claim would be timely.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

I think they would be treated

Well, under the logic of the Court of

Appeals' opinion, my brother Stevens suggests that it would be.
MISS HARRIS:

Yes, I understand that, but I believe

16

that the 1990 claim, to the extent that it alleged a discrimi­

17

natory denial of seniority resulting in a layoff or an earlier

18
19

20

termination than would otherwise have occurred, would be like
United Air Lines vs. Evans, and I don't think that's what's
alleged here.
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't really be the same as

21

United Air Lines, because there there's been the — I'm assum­

about it, in both instances would say that the 1990 charge was

MISS HARRIS:

20
21

22
23

QUESTION:

Yes, I think they would.
I think they would.

I do, too.

Let me pose a variation of

that, an alleged unlawful discriminatory denial of seniority.
That is, the statute would begin to run at the time the senior­
ity is denied, or on the first occasion when the denial of that
seniority has some impact on the employee, by way of either not

getting promoted or not getting an assignment or an increase in

salary.

MISS HARRIS:

I believe that the statute starts to

run, assuming the employee stays at work, at the point at which
it has an adverse impact on the employee, the point at which
either he is precluded from advancing because of seniority

6

because someone else was put into the position, or precluded

7

from getting a higher salary because that job grade, for

8

example, might have been upgraded and people who were higher

not get.

I think it's the point at which the adverse -QUESTION:

You really must take that position to sup­

port your other positions, must you not?

MISS HARRIS:

QUESTION:

Yes, I believe I must, and I do.

But in a small plant, a small industrial

15

operation, that might be a long, long time before there was any

impact, would it not, could be?

17

MISS HARRIS:

18
19

That's right.

It could be.

very well be, in a very static employment situation.
