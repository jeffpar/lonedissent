HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hirschhorn, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL HIRSCHHORN, ESQ. ,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

9

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a criminal conviction in which the only issue:

1 1

12

raised before this Court is whether the defendants were denied

13

their rights to a fair trial and due process of law by virtue

14

of the mere presence of cameras in the courtroom over their

15

obj ection.

16

The appellants contend that --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

This is any camera?

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

Any camera in which an effort is

made to broadcast or taperecord for later broadcast and still
photographic equipment.
QUESTION:

Does the record show that the trial was

televised either live or taped?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

The record will reflect that por­

tions of the trial were televised over the evening news in cer­
tain spots.

A total of two minutes and 55 seconds were
3

1

televised on the evening news of selected portions of the

2

trial.

3

QUESTION:

How about still photographs?

4

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

The record will not reflect the

5

presence of any still photographic camera present during the

6

proceeding.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

9

QUESTION:

10

But this was both audio and visual?
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

And the record reflects the location of

the camera?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

11

Yes, as a matter of fact, In the

12

Appendix to the appellees' reply brief at page A36, you have a

13

picture of the courtroom in which the circle with the "x" in

14

it reflects the presence of the television camera.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

But the recording was made of the entire

trial?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

The tele­

vision camera was present only for jury selection, only for
the direct examination and portions of cross-examination of
the State's main witness and for the rendition of the verdict.
QUESTION:

How about the defense evidence?

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

None whatsoever.

There was no re­

cordation of defense evidence by the television camera nor
was it even present during presentation of defense evidence.
QUESTION:

Was the jury sequestered?

25

4

1

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

Motions were repeatedly made to sequester the jury
The record will reflect that.

The defendants here do not seek whatsoever to

What is under attack here is the method
And we

contend, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the method is inherently
prejudicial, just as in Estelle v. Williams this Court con­
cluded that it was inherently prejudicial for a state to compel
a prisoner to go to trial in prison garb without any showing of
psychological studies.
QUESTION: Then you accept the finding of the Florida
District Court of Appeal that there was no prejudice in fact
in this case?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

I concede that the Florida District

25

5

1

Court of Appeal was correct in finding on the record there

2

was no measurable prejudice.

3

the issue we raise here is that human nature and our under­

4

standing of human nature and common sense tells us that being

5

on television is different than any other type of public .trial

6

and that although we may not be able to measure with specific­

7

ity the prejudice, behavioral scientists tell us that people

8

act differently, posture differently, pose differently when

9

they know they're on TV.
QUESTION:

10
1 1

The issue we raised there and

Was this kind of evidence introduced in

your record at some point?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

12

13

duce any evidence.

14

on this.

No, we were not permitted to intro­

We were never granted a de novo hearing

15

QUESTION:

Did you tender such evidence?

16

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what

17

occurred was, we filed a motion to exclude cameras in the

18

courtroom over the defendants' objection.

19

determined that he had no discretion; it was mandatory.

20

21
22
23
24

The trial judge
He

denied my motion, certified the question to the Florida
Supreme Court.

Without a hearing it was fully briefed, in­

cluding psychological studies.

After briefing on the certifiec

question the Florida Supreme Court dismissed the certified
question on the grounds that it was not dispositive of the
issue.

25

6

1

When we went back to trial we were then placed in a

2

posture where the judge said he had a mandate, he could not

3

even ask whether it was mandatory or discretionary.

4

no evidence that there was in fact prejudice per se because we

5

were not afforded an evidentiary hearing, nor do I believe an

6

evidentiary hearing would have been necessary.

7

An evidentiary hearing was

There is

not necessary in Estelle

8

v. Williams, an evidentiary hearing was not necessary in Jack-

9

son v. Denno when this Court determined that it is inherently

10

prejudicial to a defendant for a jury to determine the volun­

1 1

tariness of a confession.

12

QUESTION:

You're saying in effect that we as pre­

13

sumably not behavioral psychologists but as lay people in that

14

field can determine on our own whether it's inherently preju­

15

dicial that something be done?

16

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

I am saying that, Mr. Justice

17

Rehnquist, that your understanding of human nature, as you

18

did in Turney, Turner, Estes, it is not necessary to have an

19

evidentiary hearing.

20

21
22
23
24

25

Because we all know that timid people

become more timid, nervous people become more nervous, people
who are not used to being in a courtroom can only have their
anxiety exacerbated by the presence of a television camera.
QUESTION:

You're also saying, really, I think, that

there's a bit of ham in all of us, including jurists.
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think that
7

1

that is accurate, but I'm not sure that ham is the issue.

2

I know television will make a cocky witness more cocky.

3

tainly know it will make a timid witness more timid.
QUESTION:

4

I cer­

Now, when you say you know these things,

5

do you get them by osmosis or how do you -- I realize we all

6

"know" certain things that we can't demonstrate, but when you

7

say you know, this is from your own experience as a litigation

8

lawyer?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, I think we know

10

that no judge would not be fair and impartial where te imposed

1 1

a $12 fine against somebody or his portion of the fine came to

12

$12.

13

ently prejudicial because it creates the possibility, the

14

probability of a denial of a fair and an impartial trial.

15

But this Court in Turney said, that procedure is inher­

Human nature is such that being on television is
more important than not being on television.
QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that without some

sort of findings of fact or conclusions of law?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:
on the issue.

Well, there's never been a hearing

There's never been a trial.

an adversary hearing.

There's never been

When the Florida Supreme Court enacted

this rule which made it mandatory and the defendant had no con­
sent, it did it without the benefit of testimony.

23

QUESTION:

Well, haven't the Florida courts rejected

24

your position?
25

1

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

2

QUESTION:

3

Oh, yes.

And so we have a set of state courts say­

ing that your submission is erroneous?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

4

We have a set of state courts say­

5

ing that the public's -- the method of access is more important

6

in the context of sunshine in the government than individuals'

7

rights to a fair and impartial trial.
QUESTION:

yes, there is some inherent prejudice to the defendant?

21

In that sense, yes, we do.

14

You mean,..did the Florida courts say that,

Well, I tendered my faith in the

system, I presume, but there was nothing to tender, Mr. Chief
Justice.

The Florida Supreme Court made it mandatory -QUESTION:

I mean at the trial court level, when

you first were confronted with the problem, did you make an
offer of proof to the court, or did the court deny you any
opportunity to do that?

25

9

1

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

No, and yes.

I did not make an

2

offer of proof, and the trial judge said, it won't make any

3

difference if you do.

4

the question as one of great public import. Let the Florida

Supreme Court hear it.

11

the Washington Post, Ellen Goodman, who said that television

12

13

kind of thing we as a reviewing court can rely on?

14

MR. HIRSCHHORN:..

Is that the

QUESTION:

But how do we know here that it was

inherently prejudicial?

Since time began.

Human nature

hasn't changed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Well, we didn't have television --

Mr. Hirschhorn, do you rely on the Estes

case at all?

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

QUESTION:

5

Yes, I do.

What was the evidence of actual prejudice

in that case?

6

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

7

QUESTION:

None.

No evidence whatsoever.

Didn't the Supreme Court just take judi­

8

cial notice of everything, at least in Chief Justice Warren's

9

opinion and in the majority opinion?

16
17

18
19

20
21

They had no hearing on

None whatsoever, and in fact, in

the Estes case the only thing that was televised was the
prosecutor's closing argument and the rendition of the verdict.
And we suggest in this case that this is not a gag order
case and this is not a First Amendment access case.

The method

of gathering news is at issue here because the method is
inherently prejudicial.

This Court, for example, would not

hesitate to strike down any state statute which said the
state has a right to compel a defendant who is a prisoner to
appear in prison garb because, for the same reason, appearing
in prison garb, human nature tells the jurors there's something
different.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Hirschhorn, you referred me to page

23

A36 and that diagram.

Am I to infer that the word electric

Oh, yes, and the record will so

I think in one of my questions that's in my appendix

to my original brief, I point out the question, "You see the cam­
era over there?''

And a little later on, during Mr. Sion's

testimony I pointed out to the Court in an aside, "Your Honor,
I want the record to reflect that cameras are present," and the
12

1

judge quickly corrected me that it was "a camera," the same

2

camera.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Hirschhorn, I would almost conclude

4

from your submission that you would urge that neither the

5

defendant nor the prosecution, together, could stipulate to

6

have cameras, .in ' the room?

7

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

That is correct.

And unlike

8

Richmond Newspapers, where the prosecution and defense stipu­

9

lated and the judge granted the stipulation, there was no

10

discretion whatsoever.
QUESTION:

1 1

The judge had to do it --

Do you think there just ought to be a flat

12

rule excluding them, no matter whether there's any objection

13

by anybody or not?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

15

QUESTION:

23

Well, who could -- whose objection must

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

18

That would be asking for too

I think that --

16
17

No.

Yes.

In Richmond, if you'll permit

me to explain my answer, in Richmond this Court said that
closure places a very high burden on the defendant in an
effort to protect the First Amendment and the public right to
know. Down the scale a little bit, you said in Gannett, "Pre­
trial closure places a high burden on the defendant;

we

need to protect the Sixth Amendment, the defendant's personal
right."
13

1

We say that where a defendant objects to the presence

2

of cameras: in the courtroom, his objection is sufficient -- if

3

a witness:

4

herently prejudicial -- if a witness' or a juror objects, then

5

the judge -- the per se rule

6

If a witness or a juror objects, or a lawyer objects, then the

7

judge has to do the balancing test.

8

at this point, the witness or juror's right of privacy, if

9

there is one in a courtroom, and I don't think that there is,

10

--

because the method of gathering news is in­

is

where the defendant objects.

Which is more important

against the media'a method of gathering news in this case.
QUESTION:

1 1

You wouldn't say the defendant in that

12

kind of a situation you were just describing would have any

13

special right to demand that television be admitted?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

14

No, and in fact, in fact there are

15

cases that, obviously, it's been used as a tool where a defen­

16

dant has demanded that a camera come in the courtroom because

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

he wanted to embarrass and humiliate the victim who was going
to be testifying against him and the judges have exercised ;
their discretion properly under the theory that the Sixth
Amendment is not absolute, nor is the First.

The Sixth Amend­

ment yields to confidential informers, trade secrets, unruly
people, embarrassment, Richmond.

The First Amendment yields

to Zurcher, yields to Branzburg, yields to libel and obscenity,
yields to the clear and present danger doctrine, yields to
Zemel,

yields to Saxbe.

The First Amendment has to yield too.

your dissent, and I suggest to you that the state under state's

Because it violates the

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

And I suggest, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that the presence of cameras in the courtroom, which

is an unnecessary method of gathering news,violates the Sixth

Mr. Hirschhorn, obviously the behavioral

scientists' views are relevant here.

But if no courtrooms

undertake to try this out, how will behavioral scientists or
judges, or anyone else, accumulate some empirical data, if
empirical data will ever be available on the consequences, in­
stead of just what might be called speculation by behavioral
scientists and judges?

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

10

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, at page 779

1 1

of the Post-Newsweek decision, the last -- there's a paragraph

12

that says, 'The presiding judge may exclude the electronic media

13

coverage of a particular participant only upon a showing that

14

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

such coverage will have a substantial effect upon a particular
individual which would be qualitatively different from the
effect on members of the public in general, and such effect
will be qualitatively different from coverage by other types of
media."
However, two things occur.

One is, it doesn't pre­

clude coverage of the trial but just coverage of that particu­
lar witness.

And two, despite what that says, I don't know

how a judge is going to apply it.

I don't understand, and I

22

don't think the bench and the bar and I don't think witnesses
23

will know how to demonstrate the qualitative difference.
24

what that does is invite mini-trials

qualitative difference.

Do we need evidence in the record of that?

QUESTION:

I suggest

Mr. Hirschhorn, does the record tell us

8

why the portions of the trial that were televised and no

others?

10

Well, are you telling me that it was just

a voluntary decision by the media that that's all they wanted
to -- ?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

That's quite correct.

The media

selects what it wants to televise, just like it selects what
23

it wants to put in the newspapers.

In your colloquy with Mr. Justice Stevens

were you suggesting that, do you support your argument in the
fact that only snippets of what the camera picks up that
actually are broadcast in the evening news?
MR. HIRSCHHORN:

Yes.

23
24

QUESTION:

And to what effect?

MR. HIRSCHHORN:

Because, not in the sense of what

25

20

the public sees but the fact that the jury knows that the

2

camera's present just for that portion of the. State's direct

3

examination, but is not present for any portion of cross or

4

the defendant's case.

5

common sense, and human nature tell us that if a television

important than the other.

And I think in the event that

the Court has extended in

balancing the public policy of open

trials and open government in Florida, I think that the Florida
Supreme Court quite clearly could withdraw the rule.

QUESTION:

MR. FOX:

Suppose you had a camera-shy lawyer?
Well, Your Honor, that relates to another

6

issue, I think, an issue which this Court has occasionally had

7

a chance to address, Mr. Chief Justice, involving the quality

8

of representation, the quality of trial court judges, and so

9

forth.

We submit that the exposure of the trial courts and

10

the attorneys to public scrutiny I think will have an educa­

1 1

tive effect upon the public.

12

will clearly be demonstrated in front of the cameras.

13

a trial judge who is not up on the law will clearly be demon­

14

strated by the actual and real picture of what's going on.

QUESTION:

I think an incompetent attorney
I think

I understood Mr. Justice Powell to be

probing at the idea that even a competent lawyer might be less
competent if he was allergic to cameras?
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And therefore his performance might be

negatively affected.
MR. FOX:
QUESTION:
MR. FOX:

That's correct.
What do you have to say about that?
I would submit to you, the man, as the

Colorado Supreme Court said in 1956, an attorney who is a
strutter, an attorney who is a showoff, an attorney who's

25

33

1

incompetent, is going to be incompetent, a showoff, or a

2

strutter, whether the cameras are there or not.
QUESTION:

3

But that doesn't answer the question I put

4

and that I thought Mr. Justice Powell was probing at.

5

the very presence of the camera as with the camera-shy witness,

6

impairs the functioning of a highly self-conscious lawyer, if

7

you can hypothesize that?
MR. FOX:

8
9

What if

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd submit to you that

that is precisely what we've argued in our brief.

We should

10

proceed on a case by case basis.

11

in the event that a defendant files a 3.850 proceeding in

12

Florida collaterally attacking the competency of his counsel,

13

then we should proceed on a case-by-case basis.

14

predicate our decision in this case upon conjecture, but upon

15

the demonstrable reality, as the Court stated

16

in Beck v.

The Attorney General of Florida will address the
Court now.

QUESTION: In other words it can't apply to television.
There are a lot more people watching.
MR. SMITH:

Certainly, and the presence of the media

in the courtroom and your recent judgment in the Richmond case
recognized the surrogate responsibility that the media has and
the function that they perform in bringing to the attention of
the public any kind of trial that is newsworthy.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Attorney General, I understand

the argument that the televising has an educational, public
good to it.

And I understand that Florida is the Sunshine

State in many ways.

But does the televising in your

25

36

1

submission improve the quality of justice that's administered

2

in a courtroom?
MR. SMITH:

3

The experience that we have had to date

4

in Florida, and we have certainly had our share of highly sen­

5

sational publicized trials, has been that the presence of

6

cameras in the courtroom has indeed improved that process .

7

The fact is, in the Zamora trial, which was a very sensational,

8

highly publicized capital case, was televised gavel-to-gavel

9

in Florida, and portions of that trial were shown worldwide.

10

The experience in that proceeding was that for the most part

1 1

the media was down the hall or downstairs in a room watching

12

the proceedings on the TV monitor, rather than going back and

13

forth in the courtroom carrying messages to each other.

QUESTION:

15

Well, Mr. Attorney General, unless Estes

is overturned, wouldn't your rule be invalid in a rather large

category of cases?

Why?

constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

I know, but I just asked you about the

category of trial such as Justice Harlan described in his

opinion in that case.

in which television would be per se prejudicial.

it?
QUESTION: No, not at all.
QUESTION:

That isn't what he held.

That isn't what

his opinion said, and it certainly isn't what the other four
justices in the majority said.
MR. SMITH:

Justice Harlan said that obviously he

was not willing to go along with the four other justices and
on a per se basis deny states the right.
QUESTION:

He said, however, in the notorious trial

there was a per se rule without the necessity of demonstrating
22

any particular prejudice.
23

MR. SMITH:

My reading of that opinion is he said,

24

a sensational trial in 1962 under the facts in the Estes case.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that almost self-defining?

2

Wouldn't any trial which television was interested in covering

3

be

by

4

definition a notorious or sensational trial?
MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, the experience in Florida

5

is that every news station in our state has a courthouse beat

6

and it is common in the TV news programs and in the newspapers

7

in Florida that what is going on at the courthouse is reported.

QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

What about the Zamora case?
Excuse me, Your Honor?
Do you think Justice Harlan would have

thought that the Zamora case fell within his definition of a

MR. SMITH:

I do not, Your Honor, and I would like

clemency meetings in capital cases, they see the television

the Court:
Being around television and watching television is
different than being on television.

I don't care how many

television sets are in a person's home or how many hours a
day my children watch TV, when that witness sits down and
that camera's present, he sees it. In Zamora there was no
objection to the presence of cameras in the courtroom.

Zamora

was a peculiar case because the defense in that case was that
cameras made the defendant insane and the defendant invited
cameras in the courtroom.

So Zamora doesn't apply.
