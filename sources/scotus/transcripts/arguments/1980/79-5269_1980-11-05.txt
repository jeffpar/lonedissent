MR. MEEHAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Arizona
Supreme Court which affirmed a conviction of Petitioner Edwards
which included the use of incriminating testimony given by him
to police officers at an interrogation just before he was to
be given appointive counsel at his first court appearance.
The offenses arise from a robbery of a bar in Tucson.
Arizona, in October of 1974.

The case went unsolved for a

considerable period of time but ultimately by gaining confes­
sions from two accomplices the police solved the case sometime

17

before January 19, 1976, about 15 months after the offenses.
18

At that point the police obtained a complaint from a magis­
19

trate to determine probable cause to believe

that

an

of­

20

fense had been committed, who issued an arrest warrant for
21

Robert Edwards.
22

The police then went to a slum area of Tucson and
23

arrested Edwards, who then was young and indigent, and took
24

him to the Tucson Police Department.
25

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. MEEHAN:

How old was he?
He was 23 at•that time, Your Honor.

3

He was 24 at the time of the trial, which was more than a year

4

later.
At the Police Department he was read his Miranda

5

6

rights, which he said he understood.

7

ment at the Tucson Police Department, when interrogated by a

8

police detective named Bunting.

9

was denying any implication in the offense.

MR. MEEHAN:

20

MR. MEEHAN:

Well, as I understood their brief, they

Well, Your Honor, they did until a week

ago today when they filed a supplemental brief.

But in their

brief they very expressly, in that portion of the argument,
agreed that he had been formally charged.

As a matter of fact

they agreed in the statement their question presented.
After the tape recording of the statement, Edwards

21

22

He had been formally charged, we con­

agree with you here.

16
17

And he had already been formally charged

tend, and the State had agreed with us in the lower courts.

14

15

At that time his statement

at that time?

12
13

He gave a recorded state­

and Detective Bunting had an exchange back and forth about
whether he would make a further statement.

He apparently

23

tried

to

convince

the

police that they should talk with

24

him about some kind of a deal.

The police said that they would

25

4

1

give him a chance to tell his side of the story but they would

2

not entertain any kind of deal.

3

Ultimately, Edwards was taken for holding overnight

4

at the Pima County jail after he told Detective Bunting in

5

words to the effect:

6

I'm not going to make a deal now, I'm going to wait until I

7

get my attorney.

MR. MEEHAN:

"Forever after" is a long time,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

15

Do you think forever after he would be --

that no statement would be admissible?

12

14

I'm not going to make a statement now,

Well, that's what I had in mind.
I think that "forever after" until the

next day at 1:30 when he was given a first arraignment, or
possibly if he had, of his own, changed his mind and decided
that he wanted to talk further with the police; yes , he should
not have been interrogated without -QUESTION:

So your position is, he could change his

mind and agree to speak?
MR. MEEHAN:

My position is that under the right cir­

cumstances I think he might be able to change his mind.

I say

that that is not in this case, but -QUESTION:

I'm not talking about this case, now.

MR. MEEHAN::

I understand.

24

QUESTION:

I'm talking about trying to discern

25

5

1

your position.

2

MR. MEEHAN:

My position is that in terms of applica­

3

tion of Miranda, Mr. Chief Justice, that unless truly the

4

accused himself institutes a change of mind, that there should

5

be no reinterrogation until counsel has a chance to confer

6

with the accused who has asked for it.

7

clear,

8

accused

9

from the situation where the accused simply listens to the

This Court made very

I think, in Miranda, that that situation,
asks .;.for

where

an

a lawyer., should be treated differently

10

rights and then goes ahead and speaks or even listens to the

11

rights being read to him and decides to remain silent, which

12

indicates that he is feeling capable of making his own deci­

13

sions about whether to deal with the interrogating officers or

14

not to deal with them.

15
16

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

It was said in Miranda and this Court confirmed in
a majority and concurring opinions in Mosley, and in Innis,
and in Fare v. Michael C., that Miranda meant what it said;
that unless -- at least as far as the police reinterrogation
-- once the accused has been read his Miranda rights and says
he'd like to have a lawyer, that there shall be no reinterroga­
tion until a lawyer is provided.
This case demonstrates, I think, why that often is
no great burden, because there was no reason that the interro­
gation couldn't have been carried out after 1:30 on the 20th
of January.

Instead it was carried out on the morning of

25

6

1

20 January, hours before Edwards would be making his first

2

appearance and at a time when the police were aware that

3

Edwards as an indigent would be appointed counsel that after­

4

noon.

They knew that he was about to get a lawyer.
QUESTION:

5

Well, it could be, Mr. Meehan, that if a

6

crime occurs at 11 o'clock at night, that there aren't many

7

lawyers willing to get out of bed at that hour of night to

8

provide the necessary support for a defendant, that might be

9

during the daytime.
MR. MEEHAN:

10

That's true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

11

And,

12

that the police have to have a lawyer in every precinct.

13
14

indeed, in Miranda, what was said was, we're not holding

I'd like to emphasize two things about this case.
case was solved.

But

One, the

They were not looking for additional offen­

ders, they were not further investigating the case, they were
not looking for the fruits or the instrumentalities of the
crime such as may have been a justification in Innis had that
been held to have been an interrogation, they were not trying
to locate the body as was the case in Brewer v. Williams,
there was no urgency.

And even under Miranda it seems to me,

20

once the accused says, I would like a lawyer, he's indicating
21

that he feels that he needs to have that help, he needs to
22

have somebody with him.; he's acknowledging that the inherent
23

coercive atmosphere, custodial interrogation, which is the
24

focus of the Miranda guarantee

,

and the reason for the

25

7

1

warnings and affording the right to counsel is affecting him.

2

QUESTION:

3

solved as to Edwards?

4

MR. MEEHAN:

5

QUESTION:

When you say the case was solved, was it

Yes.
Well, it certainly won't be, if you have

6

your way in this Court.

7

not ?
MR. MEEHAN:

8
9

I mean, Edwards will go free, will he

I think that's an assumption that can't

be made at this point, because at the trial the evidence in­

10

cluded the testimony of the police officers, but also testimony

11

of an accomplice named Cleveland Reed.

12

and before this interrogation.of Edwards, a tape-recorded con­

13

fession of another accomplice named Soto.

14

that tape recorded confession had been played, several minutes

15

There was also obtained,

As a matter of fact

of it, at least, for Edwards on the morning of his interroga­

16

tion, which prompted the admissions that are the subject of

17

this case.

18
19

20

21
22

25

QUESTION:

Would you consider it a solution of the

case if the police got incriminating statements from three
potential suspects to whom they had not read their Miranda
rights, and all of their declarations were excluded and the
jury returned verdicts of acquittal?
MR. MEEHAN:

I think I would treat it as having been

solved by virtue of what the police felt at the time that they
undertook the interrogation, and I think, number one, it would
8

1

2
3
4

be somewhat unrealistic to have a set of facts in which there
were three different statements without Miranda rights having
been read to them.
But secondly, it seems to me the focus has to be at

5

6
7

8
9

10
11

the time of the interrogation.

What was the motive of the

police in undertaking this interrogation?

At that time the

offense was old, they were not, you know, on the trail of
additional accomplices.
opener,

They felt, as the State said in its

its responsor brief, they felt they had enough evi­

dence.

That’s exactly what the State said in its brief,

and they did.

And they presented it to a magistrate, and a

12

magistrate

then

has

■ the

right

and

the .

obligation

13

to weigh that evidence, to cross-examine the complaining
14

officer, to determine whether or not there's probable cause to
15

believe that an offense was committed, and the defendant com­
16

mitted it, and if so to in effect file the complaint, which is
17

to say, to approve the complaint and then to issue the arrest
18

warrant.
19

There are, of course, two issues presented in this
20

case,

one under Miranda and one under the Sixth Amendment.

21

Because the State has recently chosen to argue that no formal
22

prosecution had begun in this case, I would like to spend more
23

time talking about the Sixth Amendment aspects of it than the
24

Miranda aspects.
25

9

1

As I said,

in the courts below and in its briefs in

2

this Court, except the supplemental brief, the State has agreed

3

with the Petitioner that at the time of this interrogation

4

formal prosecution had begun and the right to counsel under

5

the Sixth Amendment as a critical stage had arisen.

6

A week ago the State contended on the virtue of a

7

Second Circuit case construing federal criminal rules of proce­

8

dure that no formal prosecution had begun.

9

was correct in its first position.

I think the State

In Arizona, under the

10

criminal rules, prosecution may be commenced in two ways,

11

either by indictment or by complaint.

12

was commenced by the filing of a complaint.

And if so, the complaint had been filed

by the county attorney of Pima County at the time of the inter­

QUESTION:

1 1

Do

you

remember, offhand, Mr. Meehan,

12

where in the respondent's original brief there is a concession

13

that your client had been formally charged at the time of this

14

interrogation ?

15

MR.

MEEHAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MEEHAN:

Yes.
I know I read it but I can't find it.
It's Footnote 47 on page 24.

The

18

respondent recognizes the efficacy of Massiah and also cites

19

without dispute the McLeod case of this Court, which was

20

21

22
23
24

25

handed down very shortly after Massiah and which I think
supports the position that we have here that it's not important
that this interrogation was carried out just before the
appointment of counsel rather than just after, because of the
holding of this Court in vacating what the Ohio courts had done
in McLeod.

That distinction, I think, is clearly not

11

1

important.

terms of the motivation of the interrogating officers at this

point.

Mr:

Meehan, .did the proceeding before the

MR. MEEHAN:
QUESTION:
MR. MEEHAN:

Yes.
Was it completed that day?
I cannot tell this Court that there was

a proceeding in terms of

anything more than the officer pre­

paring the complaint and swearing to it and appearing with
the complaint before the magistrate.

As an example, one of the other ways that this rule

9

has been used in times before the middle 70s when Arizona be­

10

gan to use grand juries with regularity, the so-called one-man

11

grand jury was used to investigate corruption in public office

12

We had a sheriff in Pima County who was rather famous, indeed,

13

I would say, notorious, whose prosecution was originally begun

14

with the earlier procedural equivalent of this Rule 2.2,

15

2.3, and 2.4 procedure.
QUESTION:

16

Well, has that superseded entirely the

17

old procedure where the defendant after the warrant of arrest

18

had been served on him could demand a preliminary hearing?
MR. MEEHAN:

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the prelimi­

nary hearing still exists for those felony prosecutions that
are commenced by complaint.

I think it's significant,

however -QUESTION:
MR. MEEHAN:

And that would be this type of case?
Except that there is now, because of

the more common use of grand juries and the desire not to get

13

1

1

involved with public preliminary hearings at which the accused

2

is present, a possibility of a complaint beginning a case and

3

then an indictment superseding the complaint.

MR. MEEHAN:

And what was the date of the indictment?

Edwards was arrested in 1976.

It was fairly
I should

He was not tried

him were dismissed because of procedural problems not germane
to the confession.

When the case went up to the Arizona

Supreme Court, we briefed and argued this matter, a speedy
trial and other things, and pointed out that only the second
court's file went up to the Arizona Supreme Court, and said
that we would move to amend or supplement the record if
necessary.

The State agreed with us in their briefs before

the Supreme Court as to the sequence of events, and they agreec.
with us here as to the sequence of events.

So, physically

speaking, the papers on the indictment from the first case and
the complaint are not within this Court's record, but I can

25

14

1

ask the Clerk to supplement that if that becomes necessary or

2

appropriate.
QUESTION:

3

Your position is not that the police

4

cannot at the scene of a crime interrogate witnesses whom they

5

think might be guilty, unless each and every one of the wit­

6

nesses has a lawyer, is it?
MR. MEEHAN:

7

8

No, indeed.

But that's investigative

interrogation and quite different, I think, from this case.
QUESTION:

9

MR. MEEHAN:

10

So it depends on the motive of the police?
Not motive entirely.

I think motive is

11

important in deciding what is appropriate and what is not

12

appropriate.

13

number one, there are no countervailing considerations to re­

14

quire prompt interrogation.

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

24

If there were some other problem,

if the body of the murder victim were still to be located or
if there may be other persons who were involved and should be
identified, or if there was a dangerous weapon like in Innis,
and there was a need right now to see whether this defendant
would waive his rights and answer questions so that those other
investigative activities quite properly undertaken could be
furthered, maybe the interrogation should occur right away.
QUESTION:

22
23

I think that motive is important here because,

But

will

they

ever

know unless they

ask?
MR. MEEHAN:

Well, I think that the situations them­

selves are going to be fairly easily divisible into categories
25

15

1

and of course one reason I think this situation is fairly

2

easily divisible into the category that I'm describing is the

3

fact of the complaint, and the police believing that, they'd

4

been working on the case for 15 months, they believe now

5

they've got enough, they've gotten two statements, the time

6

between the offense and the arrest, and so forth, I think sim­

7

ply tells them at that time and tells this

8

that we're dealing with a post-complaint,

9

to use a shorthand term -- interrogation.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Meehan:

I didn't understand one of

11

your answers to Justice Rehnquist.

13

a suspect a question, they've let him know he's a suspect; he

14

says, I want a lawyer.

15

Is it your view they can go ahead and question him anyway?
MR. MEEHAN:

16
17

20
21

22
23
24

25

ask

somebody who was

I don't want to answer your question.

I would say that if the suspect is in

custody it would be a consideration.
QUESTION:

18
19

Supposing you're right at

Just the fact that it's at the scene of

the crime doesn't mean he

isn't

in custody.

They tell him

he's a suspect and they give him the warnings; he says he wants
a lawyer.

As I understand your response to Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, they can still go ahead and question him.

Is that

really what you're —
MR. MEEHAN:

I didn't mean to leave that impression.

Again, I was speaking more to the Sixth Amendment issue than
16

1

to the Fifth Amendment.

2

going to change what I believe has been clearly stated in

3

Miranda and the other cases that you're bringing out that at

4

that point the police have to scrupulously honor that request

5

and not reinterrogate until a lawyer is provided.

6

point --

7

8
9

QUESTION:

I think that unless this Court is

At that

But that's based on Miranda, whereas the

facts here are Massiah -- ah, Sixth Amendment —
MR. MEEHAN:

I think that this is more a Sixth

10

Amendment, Massiah -- or really, a Brewer type of case than it

11

is a Miranda type of case, although obviously the two really

12

come very close together.

17

18
19

20
21

22

QUESTION:

In Miranda, for Miranda to help him, he

would have to be in custody, would he not?
MR. MEEHAN:

Yes.

Whereas, with the Sixth Amendment

custody isn't important but may exist here.
QUESTION:

Under the Arizona practice, at what point

after the complaint is presented to the magistrate and presum­
ably filed is the defendant, the person in custody, informed
of that fact?
MR. MEEHAN:

I'm not sure, except I know that at the

initial appearance

which was the proceeding that was to have

taken place on the

20th, one of the functions is to either

read to or provide

a copy of the complaint which

23
24

is referred to

as the formal charges, and to advise of rights and so forth.
25

17

1

2

QUESTION:

Well, then, did he get this notice on

the 20th?

3

MR. MEEHAN:

The record indicates that he was shown

4

a copy of the arrest warrant at the time he was arrested on

5

the 19th,

6

him to read but to support the arrest, because there is an in­

7

dication that there was a scuffle at the time of the arrest.

8

He was told generally that he was an accused in a murder case c n

9

the 19th when he was interrogated by Sergeant Bunting at the

shown in the sense,

I am sure, of not handing it to

In terms of explaining to him pre­

morning of the 20th that, I'll tell you -- I'll talk with you,
but I don't want anything tape recorded because I don't want
it used against me in court.
It seems to me that the State must argue, and ob­
viously does argue, that Edwards' Sixth Amendment right was
waived, and the question then becomes whether in fact a waiver
can occur of that right and whether it can be supported by the
facts in this case.

Brewer v. Williams is the closest that

22

this Court has come to finding what will support a waiver in
23
24

a Sixth Amendment as opposed to a Miranda or a Fifth Amendment
kind of a case.

Brewer did not, however, reach what would be

25

18

1

sufficient.

2

the right to counsel, which involved the factfinding process,

3

the fairness of the trial, and the reliability of the trial,

4

have always been required to be made in open court and

5

approved and supervised by a trial judge, so far as I can tell.

6

This Court has said in in the Schneckloth case that the high

7

standard of waiver which I think applies in the Sixth Amendment

8

kinds of cases requires a showing of knowledge, understanding,

9

and voluntary relinquishment that can only, or at least is de­

All other waivers of trial rights, rights like

10

signed to be carried out in that kind of a setting.

1 1

that in the case that's before the Court, there is no justifica­

12

tion for finding a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to

13

counsel.

14

high standard that this Court has imposed by Johnson v.

15

Zerbst and by Fare v. Michael C., and by at least in dictum

16

Schneckloth, and Faretta v. California for waiver of right to

17

counsel at a critical stage, that a waiver should be either

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

25

I submit

It's possible that in order to establish the very

conducted before a magistrate or a judge in open court so that
the record can be made that should be made.

Or that it cannot

be accepted unless counsel has had a chance to consult and
advise the client, or at the very least, that it be an express
waiver of a kind that would provide independent evidence.
And I say,

independent from the testimony of those who really

have an interest in establishing a waiver, a videotape, an
audio tape, or even a written waiver.
19

I'm not suggesting that

1

this Court needs to accept or reject any one of the three or

2

that even any one of the three necessarily have to be exclu­

3

sive, but it seems to me that the cases of this Court impose

4

a very high standard of joined waiver and that in order to

5

fulfill that some kind of quite reliable factfinding process

6

needs to be undertaken before there can be a waiver.
In this case, what do we have that would establish a

7

8

waiver?

Number one, when the police went to the jail on the

9

morning of the 20th to interrogate Edwards, he said he didn't

110

want to talk to them.

11

want to come out of "the hole," as he described it.

12

two, after he was given his Miranda rights and was read a tape

13

recording of another accomplice, he made the very conflicting

14

statement, I'll tell you what you want to hear, but I don't

we can testify to what you say.

There are two of us here;

He didn't say, oh, okay.

He

said, I don't want it used against me in court so I don't want
it tape recorded.
And finally, he did not say anything about giving up
his right to counsel.

He didn't say, well, I wanted a lawyer

yesterday but today I feel more able to deal for myself and so
I don't want one today.

Under these facts, it seems to me

there can be no waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
24

QUESTION:

Mr. Meehan, when do you contend that the

25

20

1

interrogation started?
MR. MEEHAN:

2

I haven't focused on it that clearly,

3

Your Honor, in terms of after Edwards was brought into the

4

interview or interrogation room at the jail.

5

his rights, they said they wanted to talk with him.
QUESTION:

6

They read him

Well, specifically, do you contend that

7

playing him the tape of the other person's confession was the

8

commencement of interrogation under Rhode Island v. Innis?
MR. MEEHAN:

9

10
1 1

Yes, I think it was, because I think it

was done
QUESTION:

It makes a great deal of difference as to

12

whether there was a waiver at that point or later.

13

the waiver question, I think you first have to decide when the

14

interrogation started.

15
16

17

21

22
23

MR. MEEHAN:

Tb answer

That statement supposes that by listen­

ing to the tape and making a judgment as to the efficacy of
that tape in being able to convict Edwards that he then was
more informed in terms of his need for counsel, and I'm not
sure I agree with that.

It seems to me that the playing of

the tape was designed to get Edwards to talk.

They were tell­

ing him how everybody else was -QUESTION:

If you say that, then they have the burden

of proving waiver before they started to play the tape.
MR. MEEHAN:

Yes, that's true, that Is true.

And

24

that then eliminates the conflicting statements that were made
25

21

1

after the tape was played.

If the Court please, I would like to reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. McCLENNEN:

8
9

Very well, Mr. Meehan.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves two issues, admissibility of a con­

10
11

fession after a request for an attorney, and the waiver of the

12

Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

13

are several important facts to be considered in this case.

The State feels that there

First is, Mr. Edwards was warned of his right four

14

15

times.

16

this, but Sergeant Bunting, everyone agrees, advised him twice:

17

18
19

20
21
22
23
24

25

Now there is fairly considerable disagreement about

once at the beginning of the interview and once on the tape.
Detective Marmion advised him of his rights the next morning.
And on page 70 of the record Mr. Edwards himself says that
Officer Allen advised him of his rights -- page 70 of the
Appendix:
"Q.

At any time did Sgt. Bunting or Steve Bunting,

the other detective, read you your Miranda rights?
A.

No.

It was a detective -- it was a black

policeman in a car.

I don't know his name."
22

1

That was four times.

2

On the night of January 19, after the discussion,

3

after the tape recorded statement, and after the discussion

back and forth about the deal, Mr. Edwards never said,

That constitutes a waiver.

Mr. McClennen,. I'm a little bit confused

about the procedure here.

On page 30 in the Appendix it

simply describes:

"Proceedings March 4,

"Larry Bunting was

.

.

1977."

And it says,

. called as witness in behalf of the

Defendant Edwards."
And then, on page 98, it says:

"Proceedings, March

And then, "Larry Bunting was thereupon recalled

No, Justice Rehnquist, the proceed­

So Detective Marmion whose

In his case, he was interested in what Mr.

Edwards

had to say, so he went to the jail the next morning, read
Mr. Edwards his rights.

Mr. Edwards acknowledged them, said

he'll answer the questions, but then Mr.
25

26

Edwards said,

first I want to hear Manny Soto's tape. Detective Marmion played

2

the tape per Mr. Edwards' request, and that caused Mr. Edwards

to confess.

QUESTION:

Where in the record is it that says that

MR. McCLENNEN:

Nothing says that that caused him to

QUESTION:

That's your conclusion?

MR. McCLENNEN:

That's my conclusion.

They played

10

the tape and immediately he says, all right, I'll give you my

11

story.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Does the record tell us how Edwards knew

they had Soto's tape?
MR. McCLENNEN:

No.

That's unclear.

He knew on the

night of the 19th that Mr.

Soto was being interrogated but

16

Mr. Edwards was not told.

He was told that Soto was confessing

17

but he was not told what he was saying.

15

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

So Mr. Edwards the

night of the 19th did not know exactly what Mr.

Soto had said.

He did not know that until the morning of the 20th.
QUESTION:

That is, specifically about the tape.

How did he know there was a tape?
MR. McCLENNEN:

There is nothing in the record that

indicates how he knew that.
QUESTION:

How who knew that?

MR. McCLENNEN:

Mr. Edwards knew that there was a tape .

I think in your hypothetical you

might have a more difficult time finding a waiver than we do

Well, why?

MR. McCLENNEN:
QUESTION:

Why?

Well

Because you're saying that it's easier to

find a waiver after you have invoked your right to counsel and
after you've invoked your right to silence than it is before?

25

MR. McCLENNEN:

MR. McCLENNEN:

In this case the police --

Whenever he does talk, then he's waived

the protections?
MR. McCLENNEN:

No.

In this case it's not that he

just talks. The police read him his rights and he says, all
right, I'll answer your questions.

v. Michael C. that the request for an attorney is a per se in­
dication of 'the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.

It's

our position that if a person could invoke the Fifth Amendment
right to remain silent, if you can later withdraw it, as in
Michigan v. Mosley, if the request for an attorney invokes the

22

Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, he can again withdraw
23
