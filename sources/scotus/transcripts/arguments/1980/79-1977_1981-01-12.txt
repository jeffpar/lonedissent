MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

Mr. Lassoff, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN LASSOFF, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LASSOFF:

7

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal brought as a result of a conflict

9

10

in the interpretation of part of a federal statute. The con­

1 1

flict arises in the application of Section 933(b) of an act

12

known as the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act.

13

Act was last amended by Congress in 1972, at which time Sec­

14

tion 933(b) was not amended.

15

in 1959 at which time it was amended to give the longshoremen

16

an additional six months' period to sue from the date of a

Section 933(b) was last amended

formal award in compensation.
QUESTION:

19

This

liminarily there?

Mr. Lassoff, might I interrupt

you pre­

I notice that there are three cases con­

solidated here, and that in the Rodriguez case as opposed to
the other two, there was an order filed, and in the other two
there were not.

Does that have any bearing on the outcome in

your view?
MR. LASSOFF:

It does, but this was not one of the

points I was given certiorari on.
25

3

It is our view, in all

1

three of these cases there was never an order which triggered

2

this mechanism, but that was not one of the points that we

3

were given certiorari on.

4

Lawyers have raised that in their brief, but we didn’t raise

5

it in our brief for today.

QUESTION:

MR.

LASSOFF:

It's not before you.

The point

in­

volved is, who was this statute designed to protect?

Going

9

back to the original basis in law, at one point a longshoreman

10

had to elect before the first payment of compensation whether

1 1

or not he could sue a third party because if he accepted one

12

payment of compensation his rights to sue were assigned abso­

13

lutely to his employer.

17

that money, that would not give the case to his employer.

That changed, until he was given the

employer.
In 1957, I believe, this Court decided the Blazey
Czaplicki case which said that conflict of interest -- and
Blazey Czaplicki was a very strong conflict of interest case
and the insurance carrier represented both parties to the
litigation -- therefore, in 1959 Congress amended this Act and

So the issue was sort of dead, because any employer of maritime:

Well, this political compromise that you

refer to that took place in 1972 had the full participation

14

of the longshoremen workers' union, did it not?

15

HR. LASSOFF:

It had participation of the maritime

unions' non-sea unions, and of the stevedores.

17

companies had no part in this arrangement at all.

only interest that the shipowner has in this litigation at all

12

is that he be sued by the real party in interest, one lawsuit.

since the decisions in Rodriguez, since the decisions in

insurance companies, not stevedoring companies but insurance
companies of stevedores, to ratify the longshoremen's cause
of action.

The one time we tried the suggestion in Caldwell,

which was involuntary joinder, that was against the company
called International Terminal Operating Company, their attor­
neys opposed the involuntary joinder and it was denied.
7

1

But the fact is that no stevedoring company that I

2

know of anywhere has ever sued a ship to assert the claims of

3

the injured employee, and the decision that a longshoreman can

4

prove a conflict of interest, which is so apparent on the

5

face, never happened without means of extra protection.

6

doesn't make sense to me.
QUESTION:

7

It

Well, the -- of course, it could be that

8

logically, It could be that the injured longshoreman has al­

9

ways sued.

10

MR. LASSOFF:

1 1

QUESTION:

Not quite, Your Honor, as --

Weil, logically, it could be, but here's

12

one case where it didn't happen.

13

MR. LASSOFF:

14

15

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

20

21

MR. LASSOFF:

Yes; yes.

But there are hundreds of

cases affected by this particular -- there are hundreds of
cases in the district court now which are on a so-called sus­
pense calendar because of this particular case.
QUESTION:

22
23

But I would suppose in the vast majority

of the cases the longshoreman himself would sue.

18
19

There are five in Virginia and five here, all in

this one here.

16

17

There are at least ten cases here,

Why, as a matter of practical fact,

doesn't the longshoreman sue In the six-month period given
to him?

24

MR. LASSOFF:
25

Ordinarily, he does.

There are

1

problems when you are dealing with foreign flag steamship

2

companies, as 92 percent of the ships coming to the United

3

States are.

4

We can start an action by mail, but if we do not perfect ser­

5

vice the courts dismiss these actions.

6

is easy to start these actions within six months of an award

7

is usually so, but not always so.

8
9

10
11

They are a difficulty in locating the company.

QUESTION:

So that to say that it

Congress could -- or, I'll put it this way,

could Congress correct that and make some other form of ser­
vice possible so that it would eliminate the problem?
MR. LASSOFF:

Congress could do many things.

Con­

12

gress could compel the shipowners to post bond of insurance

13

on their coming here.

Yes.

of these things -QUESTION:

Or it could enlarge the time beyond six

months; make it a year, 18 months, two years.
MR. LASSOFF:

The question is not a period of time.

The question is, what is the intent of Congress?
QUESTION:

Every bill

Well, Congress could do that.

MR. LASSOFF:

Every bill says, safety; this is a

hazardous occupation, eight times the national rate, four

times the national rate.

Every bill says that.

MR. LASSOFF:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH T. STEARNS, ESQ.,

My name is Stearns.

I represent the first two

and Arya National Shipping line in this case, which involves

5

a question of Section 33 and also Section 5(b) of the Long­

6

shoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.

named,

Compass Shipping Company, Djakarta Lloyd

There has been a brief reference to some part of the

7

8

history of the Act.

As I understand it, the Longshoremen's

9

and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was adopted in 1927 in

10

response to a decision of this Court making longshoremen

11

Jones

12

It provided that longshoremen have an election of either com­

13

pensation or a suit for damages.

14

the concern for the possibility that someone who would unwit­

15

tingly lose his right to a third party damage suit, Congress in

16
17
18
19

Act

22
23
24
25

Att that time there was a Section 33.

In response apparently to

1938 amended Section 33 to expand the rights in a way which
this Court in 1947 in the American Stevedores v. Porello case
held to extend to

longshoremen the dual right to accept volun­

tary compensation and thereafter sue for damages.
After Ryan, and perhaps before that, perhaps in the

20
21

seamen.

contribution cases, the existence of the right to accept volun­
tary compensation and sue for damages created a conflict of
interest.

Unquestionably, there was a conflict of interest

which was raised by the Ryan indemnity right, which in in­
stances where there was common insurance between a defendant
13

1

and a third party defendant, as in the Czaplicki case, it was

2

held by this Court that it was inappropriate to give effect

3

to the Section 33(b) assignment.

4

in 1959 In an attempt to overcome the conflict of interest

5

gave longshoremen an additional six months to sue following

6

receipt of compensation pursuant to an award.

In response to that, Congress

As a result of this Court's efforts on behalf of

7

8

longshoremen, in part demonstrated by the Porello case, the

9

extension of the dual remedy of compensation and a right to

10

sue for damages, as a result of this Court's Ryan decision, as

1 1

a result of this Court's Sieracki decision, the situation

12

existed -- a situation existed whereby longshoremen were of

13

course by statute guaranteed compensation and in effect

14

guaranteed a virtually certain right to recover damages.

15

result of these facts, and as a result directly of this Court's

16

efforts on behalf of longshoremen, there followed an explosion

17

of litigation in the years, according to the congressional

18

documents, between 1961 and 1972, to the point where in ports

19

such as New York virtually every longshoreman's reported acci­

20
21

22
23
24

25

dent resulted in a third-party suit.

As a

By virtue of Sieracki it

was virtually necessary only for the longshoreman to show that
he was hurt aboard the ship. As a result of the contest between
the shipowner and the stevedore as to who should pay the dam­
ages, the ultimate recovery of the plaintiff was further guar­
anteed .
14

1

Congress in 1972 was therefore confronted with a

2

situation where this Court's efforts had resulted in a situa­

3

tion where longshoremen had a free access to suit and a free

4

access to recovery in their third party cases where, as a re­

5

sult of those facts, there had been a tremendous increase in

6

litigation and took steps by enacting the 1972 amendments in

7

order to reduce the volume of litigation in exchange for

8

vastly increased compensation benefits.

9

As Mr. Lassoff has indicated,

Congress in 1972 took

10

away from longshoremen certain things and this represents the

11

first instance since 1927 where either by this Court or any

12

other court or by Congress something was taken away.

13

taken away was two things, we submit.

14

ly, being the right to recover for seaworthiness, and the

15

second thing, we believe, is that there was an additional re­

16

striction placed on the third party right in order to serve

17

the first purpose of the 1972 amendments, which was to reduce

18

litigation and relieve shipowners and the courts from the

19

enormous burden of case after case after case of personal

What was

The first one, obvious­

20

injuries involving longshoremen, some of which were of the kinc.

21

or the type or the apparent lack of seriousness of the cases

22
23
24

25

involved in this appeal.

The additional step taken by Congress.,

we submit, was to make the right of the longshoreman to sue
depend upon that suit being in accordance with Section 33,
which we read as indicating that suit can be maintained only
15

1

if authorized by the six months provision in Section 33(b),

2

which means, we submit, that no suit brought by a longshoreman

3

after six months can be maintained, since the six months provi­

4

sion is a constituent element of this cause of action.
In the congressional documents there is an indica­

5

6

tion in the Port of Philadelphia that the compensation insur­

7

ance rate for these accidents, including the cost of compensa­

8

tion and the stevedores' third party Ryan indemnity liability,

9

was approximately $40 a payroll hundred.

According to the

10

New York State Rating Board, in New York today, for workmen's

1 1

compensation alone, in the category, "stevedoring-not otherwise

12

classified," the annual rate for stevedores is $87 and change

13

per payroll hundred.

14

stevedore both for compensation and third party Ryan indemnity

15
16

17

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

That is to say that the cost to the

liability in 1972 was approximately half what it is today.
And these figures are not figures that are the product of in­
flation.

It's $40 per $100 and $87 per hundred, and it

re­

presents a doubling of cost in real terms, as a direct result
of the vast increase in benefits achieved by the 1972.amend­
ments.

It means in effect that the maritime industry -- and

since the stevedore has one customer, the shipowner -- since
the stevedore is in effect an agency of the shipowner, that the
shipowner pays these costs directly, usually as soon as the
ship sails.

It means the cost of these claims before the

first complaint is filed

has doubled.

25

16

1

It also means that if there is not relief from liti­

2

gation, that the purposes of the Act to achieve a reduction of

3

litigtion will not be achieved and that in effect there will

4

be no so-called quid pro quo extended to the maritime industry

It is vital to the interests of the maritime

It is essential to the vitality ofthe maritime indus­

workmen's compensation, benefits as a result of his third
party suit only when his verdict exceeds $7,500.

As a result

of this Court's recent decision in the Norfolk S Western
v. -- the Liepelt case, the compensation liability, or rather,
the tax liability, of the injured employee must be reduced in
calculating his lost wages and loss of future wages.

If he

was receiving workmen's compensation at the rate of $9,000 a
year, the net of $36,000 would mean that the stevedore's
compensation exposure would be suspended for a period of four
years.

It means that the benefit of a third party suit where

provision

of

Section 5 be interpreted liter­

ally and be a basis for barring a longshoreman's suit after
six months from the time that they receive their award.

And

there's an additional point made with respect to the safety
of longshoremen which is not by any means certainly guaranteed
or even advanced by the bringing in of longshoremen personal
injury cases.

It is basically our position that this matter

of six months to sue is not a matter of Rule 17, it's a matter
of Section 33 and Section 5(b), it's a time bar, it prevents
absolutely the bringing of a suit by a longshoreman unless

22

there is compliance with the statute which authorizes his

suit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS X. BYRN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT OVE SKOU, R. A.
MR. BYRN:

Twenty-five years ago I was admitted to the Bar of

24

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

this Court to work on the brief in the Czaplicki case, and I
find it rather fascinating that I have returned here now 25
years later to talk to the Court about the interpretation of
Czaplicki.

Which makes me, I think, the historian on this

particular argument.
And if we could return

for the moment

to 1956

when the Congress decided to respond to the Ryan decision -and they did so very expeditiously, following the decision of

25

this Court in early 1956, there were extensive hearings held,

21

And as I

this six-month provision rule from the time of the award.
Now, we've talked about six months here, but frequently, as
in these cases before us, the time ends anywhere from a year
and a half to two years that the man himself has the right to
sue.

He has the full opportunity to bring suit anytime during

that period.

And that's the thrust of the Rodriguez case.

Now, in those hearings, the comment by, I think, the
representative of the Association of the Bar of the City of
New York, who said that these congressional adjustments were

22

the complete answer to Mr. Justice Black's objections in his
23

dissent in the Ryan case, that the stevedore would in effect
24

be suing himself.

So this was all hashed over, way back when,

25

23

1

in 1956.

And then we moved forward.

2

the '12 amendments, but we move

3

cases that this Court has had.

Hr. Stearns has covered

forward to a number of the

And in two recent decisions of this Court, Edmonds

4

5

and Bloomer, the Court itself has read this particular section,

6

933(b), in accordance with its plain meaning.

7

the cause of action is assigned after six months to the

8

employer.

9

905, the Court incorporated Section 933 into that section and

10

said

point.

The Edmonds case also discusses that

"We go on to the Pfifer case

v. Ford, where the

point of rest question was considered, and the Court said it
was inconsistent with the congressional intent.
So, all throughout these cases, right down to the

20
21

Bloomer case and the most recent case, on December 15, the
Potomac Electric case, there again the Court defers to Congress,

22

to the plain language of the Act, to the unambiguous provi­
23

sions even where they may reach an anomalous result.

And I

24

think that case involved a question of whether schedule awards

24

apply where the man could take his wages.

And the Court said,

2

we might have done otherwise, perhaps, but Congress has said

3

this, and this is the way we have to rule.

4

QUESTION:

But you think the result was anomalous?

5

MR. BYRN:

I think the Court of Appeals said so, and

6

I think perhaps this Court and yourself said so.
I return again to the Czaplicki case.

7

And there

8

the Court in discussing the conflict said, under the peculiar

9

circumstances, the peculiar facts of this case, we find a con­

10

flict.

1 1

which I think misinterprets

12

"The fundamental point in Czaplicki is that notwithstanding a

13

statutory assignment of the longshoreman's right of action

14

15
16
17

18

Now, as opposed to that, we have the Caldwell case,

the right of action may be revested in the longshoreman when
it becomes manifest that the assignee, with knowledge of its
exclusive right to control and prosecute the claim, neverthe­
less declines to do so for any reason."

21

Not because of a con­

flict, but for any reason.
And then it goes on to legislate certain procedures

19

20

Czaplicki and says, on page 1046,

that are followed, again taking over the congressional role
there.

I think Congress has spoken, and the man has his sea­

son in which to sue.

Thereafter Congress clearly intended,

22

I think, that the cause of action would then be assigned and
23

if the assignee didn't do anything about it, that's the end of
24

the case:

two intentions not to sue, one manifested by the

25

25

1

man himself, and one by the employer.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Byrn.

MR. LASSOFF:

Justice.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

8
9

Do

you have anything more, Mr. Lassoff?

4

5

Thank you very much.

MR. LASSOFF:

May I point out to the Court that in

Edmonds, which is a decision of this Court in March, 1979,

10

the Court cautioned that this change in the statute was strik­

1 1

ing a delicate balance between the law as it was as created

12

by the judiciary and Congress, and as amended by Congress

13
14

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22

taking away certain rights.

Nowhere in the 1972 bill does it

mention the six-month statute as being intended to take any­
thing away from the rights of the longshoreman.

And Mr. Jus­

tice White who wrote the opinion said, very clearly, that
"where Congress has been silent in this delicate balance it is
not up to us to act."

Congress said not one word, in either

the Senate or House, about this section, and this section was
not changed in the '72 amendments.
One thing that isn't too vital but as Mr. Justice
Marshall noted, Mr. Stearns likes to roam far afield.

I had a

recent situation with Mr. Stearns in New York before a federal
23

judge, Judge Pierce -24
