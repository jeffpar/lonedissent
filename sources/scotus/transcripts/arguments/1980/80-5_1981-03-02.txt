ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTANIAH EYTAN, ESO.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

MR. EYTAN:

We’ll hear arguments next

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Richard John McCarty, the husband in a California

10
1 1

divorce action, appeals the decision of the California Court

12

of Appeal, First Appellate Districts which we've had affirmed a

13

Superior Court determination that the husband's expectancy

14

in receiving Army retired pay should be awarded in part to

15

his ex-spouse.

16

the Superior Court had properly applied California law -- and

17

that's a crucial matter in this entire case -- and that having

18

applied California law the expectancy in retired pay was

19

indivisible and then divided the Army retired pay pursuant to

20

established California formula.

The Court of Appeal took the position that

The husband contended then and contends now that

21

22

federal law prohibits such a result, and federal law not only

23

applies but preempts California from making such a determina­

24

tion .

25

The facts in the case can very briefly be summarized.

1

The parties were married in Oregon in 1957 and were divorced

2

in California, or at least they were separated in California,

3

in 1976.

medical school in Oregon. He was a domiciliary of Oregon, as

5

was his wife. In his fourth year of medical school, the hus­

6

band joined the Army arid remained in the Army for the entire

7

period up until the divorce.

8
9

When the parties were married the husband was in

After spending one year in Oregon he was transferred
by the military to Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia,

10

Texas, Hawaii, California, staying in each place for a number

11

of years.

12

Before the Superior Court the husband contended that

13

he was an Oregon domiciliary and that California could not

14

apply its quasi-community property regime, which is encom­

15

passed in Section 4803 of the California Civil Code.

16

a somewhat unusual provision which provides that property

17

which is acquired by either party to a marriage while domi­

18

ciled outside of California shall be treated as community

19

property if the party would have been domiciled in California

20

at the time of the acquisition of the property.

21

That's

perty, it then is treated as community property.

this case, and by explaining what happened before the lower

courts I can deal with that as a preliminary matter.

7

the Superior Court the husband submitted the decision in

8

Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo of the California Court of Appeals.

9

That decision was not terribly dissimilar from the decision of

Before

this Court in the same case, which came out sometime later.
QUESTION:

Under California law, assume hypotheti­

12

cally that he had been a physician for General Motors or

13

Du Pont all this time and had precisely the same experience.

14

Ultimately, would his pension be subject to division under the

15

California community property law?

16

MR. EYTAN:

Yes.

What makes this case so distinc­

17

tive is that the’California Court here improperly assumes that

18

California law applies of its own force.

19

Mr. Chief Justice, there should be no question that California

20

law has everything to say and federal law has nothing to say

21

about the matter.

great detail all elements of Army pay, Army retired pay,

Would it be your contention that

10

that wouldn't be subject to equitable division under the

11

California formula?

12

MR. EYTAN:

13

QUESTION:

No, I would not so contend.
So that It's just the in-the-future

14

retirement pay and hot thd past accumulations that you're

15

arguing about?

16

MR. EYTAN:

Well, I would argue, of course, that

17

the future element of it is very significant, but of course

18

my argument goes way beyond that.

19

to what I consider to be the main part of the argument it will

20

more fully answer your question.

QUESTION:

12

Until then they weren't, and of

So that since 1957 Army personnel have been subsumed

13

under social security in the way that when the Army man gets

14

his paycheck, there's a subtraction for social security and

15

if the wife never works a day in her life and never accumu­

16

in her own right, she collects benefits, the ex-wife collects

25

QUESTION:

But she collects only a widow's benefit,

not the benefit of a retired worker under social security?
MR. EYTAN:

Oh, no, under social security she col­

lects the same benefits as the spouse.
QUESTION:

Which is a widow's benefit, not that of

the person who has worked, which are quite different.
MR. EYTAN:

No, I don't think that's correct, if I

may respectfully dissent.

there is a benefit to his spouse.

3

his spouse to get a benefit, nor does he have'to die for his

4

ex-spouse to get a benefit.

5

regard is that they must have been married for ten years.

6

In addition, there are separate benefits, of course, for the

7

widow.

8

there is an offset configuration which applies to other pro­

9

grams that operate in conjunction with social security and

He doesn't have to die for

The only requirement in that

And with respect to social security widow's benefits

those are the annuity programs that I believe you had in mind.

1 1

There are annuity programs. There is also social

12

security for the widow, and there's a combination, and at the

13

top level if the widow gets the maximum amount of the annuity,

14

she doesn't get social security by an offset and she doesn't

15

get the maximum amount of the annuity she gets from social

16

security.

17

But interestingly, there's no offset as against the

18

ex-spouse at all.

19

And the annuity program, you're correct, is only to the widow.

20

Social security is not.

21

The offset is only as against the widow.

Now, the main point in all this, if one can cut

22

through the heart, is that obviously California law cannot

23

apply of its own force and effect.

25

are very important considerations both to the national program

There are very practical, direct consequences, and

2

as Hisquierdo taught us and perhaps, more importantly, as we

3

know from Clearfield Trust and its multiple progeny, that

4

where important federal programs, important interests of the

5

federal government are implicated, are involved, we look to

6

federal law.
Now what does federal law tell us in this case?

7

8

If we had a civil service situation here, if we had a civil

9

service husband, we would have direct federal law telling us

10

what to do because the Congress has in Title V, Section

1 1

8345(j)(l) told us that you defer to the states and whatever

12

the state rule is, you apply it.
The same thing is now true for the Foreign Service.

13
14

But the Congress has not done that for the military.

15

have not passed a direct statement of their intention as to

16

what federal law ought to apply and I would submit to you, the

husband would submit to you,

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, but, the Congress passed the Code

of Military Justice, didn’t it?
MR. EYTAN:

3

Yes, but the point that I'm trying to

4

make, Mr. Justice, is that Congress could not -- I don't be­

5

lieve it could -- I am making the argument to you that it

6

could not pass the same kind of a formula enactment as it did

7

to the civil service because the consequences for the Army,

8

for the Army retirees, would be far different than for civil

9

servants --

10

QUESTION:

You mean that a sensible Congress

11

wouldn't pass It, not that it doesn't have the power to pass

12

it?

13

MF. EYTAN:

Oh, of course, it has the power to do

14

anything it wants.

15

it could not follow that same formula.

16

The point that I'm trying to make is that
Let me show you why.

We know that an Army retiree remains subject to re­

17

call at any time, and any time means any time.

18

mean national emergency, it doesn't mean war, it means any

19

time that the Secretary of the service says so.

20

of that, on December 12, 1980, the Congress reaffirmed this

21

insistence that the Army retiree can be called up at any time.

22

I've mentioned in the reply brief that there is new legisla­

23

tion, so we're not talking about any 'porey' scheme going back

24

a long time or some disused statute.

25

It doesn't

And apropos

Now, at any time means that despite the fact that
10

1

we have an all-volunteer Army today, as to the Army retiree

2

the impact of this statute is conscriptive.

3

and the reason he has to go is because he is still an officer

4

in the Army.

If the Congress now were to pass a law --

QUESTION:

5

Mr. Eytan, may I ask you a question,

6

Mr. Eytan?

7

does he lose his pension?

Supposing the retiree resigns his commission,

8

MR. EYTAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

He has to go,

Yes.
He does lose his pension.

He loses --

well, may I correct you and call it retired pay?

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. EYTAN:

He loses his retirement pay?
Yes.

Now, the reason he loses his re­

13

tired pay is because retired pay is not pay for, it's not

14

deferred payment for past services.

15

enunciated' in some 16 cases which I call'to the Court's at­

16

tention, including five opinions of this Court, is that re­

17

tired pay is current pay.

18

vices.

19

do?

20

the retirement benefits are, those are deferred payments for

21

past services; and once it makes that decision, it treats

22

Army pay the way it does the General Motors official.

It's reduced pay for reduced ser­

And that's really the whole point, what did California

What does California always do?

QUESTION:

It said that whatever

Well, Mr. Eytan, supposing on a divorce

24

order to show cause for temporary provisions pending a final

25

decision, the wife asks for $300 alimony.
11

The husband is an

1

Army colonel.

2

law there?

Do you say that California can't apply its own

MR. EYTAN:

3

Certainly it can, and Congress has per­

4

mitted that in express terms.

What the Congress did in that

5

regard was really quite drastic, because in 1975 the Congress

6

changed the whole scheme of things.

7

question, what could the wife have done prior to 1975,

8

I would have said that the wife would have a very tough time

9

enforcing any California support order.

And had you1 asked me the

But, look, in 1975

10

the Congress said that when it comes to support, any kind of

11

support -- and there's a long list in the statute; I'm talking

12

about Title 42 of the Code, Section 659(a) and especially

13

Section 662(c).

14

it comes to support payments, the wife armed with a state

15

court award may proceed to garnishee the funds directly from

16

the financial officer of the appropriate federal agency.

17

And ever since then we've had wives from California and else­

18

where doing just that, and elaborate regulations implementing

19

that statute have now been published.

20

been taken care of by Congress in the very limited area of

21

support.

22

mistake it, it distinguished carefully between support and

23

property interest.

24

legislation that when we say support, we mean alimony, alimony

2

don't mean property divisions pursuant to the decrees of state

3

courts that have equitable division; a very careful distinc­

4

tion .

5

So that, as we look at what the Congress did in 197£

6

you see that there as well ;as, in social security amendments it

7

had the spousal interest in mind.

6

when the Congress provided for a spousal award for the railroad

9

retiree, it had something like a community concept in mind.

10

Indeed, I may point out a third instance where the Congress

11

had support, and only support, in mind.

12

that says that the Army man may make an allotment.

13

14

property.

15

Hisquierdo put it this way:

There is legislation
Again,

Everything deals with support, not

And what is the distinction?

We're talking here

16

about property rights, property rights that have no connec­

17

tion whatever with need.

argument, as do the amicus briefs, that spouses, ex-spouses

19

have great need.

20

late, they have to wait a long time.

21

get the runaround, or whatever.

22

My opponent

essentially makes the

Their social security payments may come
They need more; they

But that's a question of need, again, that's a

23

question of support.

The Congress has directed its attention

24

to that several times and it's come out with a formula.

25

That formula now gives the spouse more than she ever had,
13

/

1

because the Congress went so far as to allow the United States

2

to be sued directly.
But let me come again to what I consider to be the

3
4

control

5

ever was, because in this case if we apply federal law as the

6

California courts should have, the California courts should

7

have stated that under federal law Army retired pay is current

8

wages, reduced current wages for reduced services.

9

is so, the whole conceptual underpinning for the community

10
11

issue..

This case is much simpler than Hisquierdo

If that

property position evaporates,, it doesn't exist.
Now, what does the California court do?

It stub­

12

bornly applies California law in the sense that it says, let

13

us see whether there is any express statement by Congress that

14

bars us from first characterizing the property and then

15

dividing it and deciding to do anything we want to do with

16

respect to that property.

17

Now, that's not the right rule.

The right rule

18

has to be, what does federal law tell us that the appropriate

19

rule should be?

20

well be that courts should defer to state law.

21

the correct rule, but that would then be a federal rule.

22

In our case the federal rule is clear beyond peradventure,

23

because we had this Court speaking five times and for a hun­

24

dred years.

25

stated very clearly that an Army man who was retired still

I would concede that the federal rule might
That might be

3

and jumping to attention and going back into the service when

4

he's directed.

He gets his pay for staying in the service

Now, if the California court had done that, that

5

6

would have been the end of the matter.

And I wouldn't be here

7

talking about the anti-assignment statute, the Social Security

8

Act amendments, the spousal awards, and all that.

9

California court does, however, is it ignores the federal law,

What the

10

it gives it the back of the hand.

There is not a single

1 1

intelligent analysis in any community property state as to

12

the large body of federal law that says, look, this is not

13

deferred compensation for past services; this is compensation

14

for your staying eligible for recall.

15

for doing all kinds of other things, which are set out in the

16

brief.

It's your compensation

17

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

Isn't every pension a form of deferred

MR. EYTAN:

I of course would agree with you for

those pensions which do not require current services and most

25

important those which do not have current liabilities.
15

1

Your question can't be answered uniformly for the military

retiree because the Congress has spoken to that point, and

3

this Court has spoken, and the Court of Claims has spoken.

4

There is no authority to the contrary.

5

I could agree with you for Army retired pay, then and only

6

then would we come to the question whether, despite the fact

7

that this is a pension, aren't there other economic considera­

I would like to ask the Court's indulgence for one

moment while I read to you one short sentence quoting

Brantner, when he said,

"A woman is not a breeding cow to be nurtured

her prime."
16

ticular phrase, when we are talking about the plight of the

3

military wife, because the military wife's situation is

unique.

not only is supposed to be the companion, the homemaker,

to'bear and raise children, but the military wife has a very

unique position in the military.

Dr. McCarty, who was a Board-certified cardiologist, had an

16

income of $2,596.51 a month, $30,000 a year.

17

all know that cardiologists can earn upwards of $150,000

18

a year.

19

They are working today for the future.

20

-- if I may direct your attention to the fact that after

21

almost 20 years of marriage, what did Dr. and Mrs. McCarty

22

actually accumulate?

23

$200 in the bank, and a couple of thousand dollars that some­

24

body owed to them.

And I think we

Why do people do this?

Why?

Well, patriotism,

2

perhaps.

3

They're in the military because they know that from the moment

4

that they start, twenty years later they are going to have an

5

income for life.

6

And I don't think that we can possibly ignore that.

But actually I think we all know why they do it.

This is the true asset of the marriage.

QUESTION:

Well, how in the world are there so many

of them that don't stay in twenty years?
MR. WINTER:

Are they stupid?

No, I don't think they're stupid.

Perhaps they don't want to put up with it, Mr. Justice, and

that's precisely --

What does that have to do with this case?
Pardon me?
What does that have to do with this case?
Well, Mr. Justice, it has everything to

24

do with this case simply because what we're talking about is

25

the supremacy requirement.

Now, I might add, if I may, just,
19

1

Mr. Justice, that in the first place, there's a big question

of dedication here.

3

QUESTION:

Do you want us to take judicial notice

that military people and their wives are devoted people,

period?

Do you want us to take judicial notice of that?
MR. WINTER:

6

Your Honor, I'd be delighted if you

7

would take judicial notice --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WINTER:

Do you want us to do any more than that?
Yes, sir.

I really do.

And if I may

10

just point this out to you, there are two requirements of supr e-

1 1

macy. And you see, this is 'not their entire argument.

12

first place, they never actually raised the statute at the

13

time that we were in court previously.

14

the appellant here raised the unconstitutionality of the stat­

15

Let's treat this as if this were a

19

get involved in the supremacy requirement, because after all,

20

the only question here is, has the federal scheme actually

21

mandated that the state courts can no longer act over pen­

22

sions?

23

them is, there must be an actual conflict or unambiguous man­

24

date.

25

conflict at all.

And there are two requirements, Mr. Justice.

We then

One of

Now, we don't have that here, because there is no
It is not even mentioned in any of the
20

1

federal statutes, and there has to be some interference with

2

a federal interest.

3

I think it's very important for the Court to understand that,

4

because, you see, they keep on saying that this country is

5

going to fall apart if the ladies, or the wives, or the

6

spouses are able to obtain their portion of the pension.

7

nothing could be further from the truth.

8

matter is, Mr. Justice, that it's exactly the opposite way

9

around.
QUESTION:

10

And Mr. Justice, this is precisely why

The fact of the

I’d suggest you'd better address your­

11

self to the other eight, because they don't usually agree

12

with me.

13
14
15

And

And you'd look cute talking to me.
MR. WINTER:

I will address myself to the other

eight Justices then, if I may.
One of the points that is made and that is so often

16

made in this particular case by the appellant Is the fact that

17

the military would allegedly fall apart, fall apart, the

18

moment that we give the wives their share of the retirement.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Winter, I don't really think that's

20

a fair statement of their position.

21

understand it is, that Congress has said that the pension

22

or the retirement pay should belong to the retired officer

23

to the same extent in every state in the United States.

24

You're saying that there's a different rule in community pro­

25

perty states.
21

Their position, as I

1

MR. WINTER:

No, Your Honor, I think that there are

2

two things, there are two portions to your question, if I may

3

address it.

4

said, I believe that it is their statement that they are talk­

5

ing about preemption, and it is our position that there has

6

not been a preemption because the Congress has not spoken

7

about it one way or the other.

In the first place, insofar as what they have

8

Now, insofar as the second portion is concerned, I

9

believe that if the Congress wished to speak on that subject

10

and wished to have a separate rule for military divorces,

11

then Congress can certainly do that.

12

constitutional prohibition saying that they may not have a

13

federal divorce law.

14

Mr. Justice, that there is no federal divorce law.

15

QUESTION:

There is absolutely no

But the fact of the matter is,

But there is no railroad retirement

16

law either,

17

do you distinguish your case from that?

18

Now --

and yet Hisquierdo came out the way it did.

MR. WINTER:

Very easily, Mr. Justice.

How

One of the

19

-- in the first place, Hisquierdo had some very, very speci­

20

fic wording in that

21

example, that there not,'be not any assignment.

22

present case, and in the military retirement cases, there is

23

a specific provision that there can be an assignment of an

24

officer's wages.

25

that it is not subject to attachment.

particular statute.

They talk about, for
And in the

The Hisquierdo statute talks about the fact

22

1

And in the present case there is a specific provi­

2

sion for attachment in the case of support, and Congress has

3

in fact aided the wife in that regard.

4

Third, in the Hisquierdo case they talk about the

5

legal process not being mentioned in the statute.

6

words, it is actually by case law only that we're talking

7

about legal process and, as far as we're concerned here --

8

in Hisquierdo it is not subject to legal process, but in the

9

present type of a situation the legal process is not even men­

10

tioned in the statute.

11

Hisquierdo is easly differentiated.

12

In other

So that, for all intents and purposes

And another thing, sir, is about anticipation of

13

payments, again in Hisquierdo.

14

out to this Court that it is not mentioned in the military

15

situation at all.

So Hisquierdo is a very, very tightly

16

knit scheme which

I believe is restricted solely to the

17

retirement scheme, the retirement benefits, and has abso­

18

lutely nothing to do with a military retirement.

19

QUESTION:

21

MR. WINTER:

22

When does the wife's interest in this

That depends upon where they come from,

Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

MR. WINTER:

25

And again I'd like to point

Well, how about California?
In California, in the event that the

soldier comes to the State of California, our law with

reference to quasi-community property would only arise if

there were two very, very distinct requirements.

MR. WINTER:

Under quasi-community property, we

have to differentiate -QUESTION:

16

Well, I'm talking of this -- I don't

17

care about quasi-community property, I want to talk about

18

this pension. When does her interest rise in that pension?

19

MR. WINTER

The interest arises if they are

20

California residents or domiciliaries -- pardon me, and if

21

it -- then, well, if they start out in California and he

22

earns it in California and they start out there and they

23

stay there and get a divorce there, she's had this interest

24

all along.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but she doesn't have it if
24

1

they're not divorced?

2

MR. WINTER:

3

Oh, yes, she does; she does unless it is

under the quasi-community property scheme.
QUESTION:

4

Are you saying it's an inchoate inter­

5

est until there's some occasion like a divorce to take some

6

legal action about it?
MR. WINTER:

7

Only if it is under the quasi-commu­

8

nity property.

If they are residents or -- pardon me --

9

domiciliaries of another state, if they are domiciliaries of

10

another state, then what happens is that as far as California

11

is concerned, California will not touch that retirement be­

12

cause the laws of that particular state apply, Mr. Chief

13

Justice.
QUESTION:

14
15

But, doesn't the husband have the right

to assign his retirement payments?

16

MR. WINTER:

17

QUESTION:

Well, again, the question then is -Well, here, again, here are two people

married, and one of them is a retired Army officer, and

He can't do that under California law,

He cannot do that because the wife

This is part of -- I'm sorry?

3

QUESTION:

I'm just trying to find out when her

interest arises.
MR. WINTER:

Her interest arises as they earn it

4

because under the community property scheme the husband and

5

wife are working together.

6

the fact that the husband, when he works, actually does not

7

contribute any more to the benefit of the couple'sulife toge­

8

ther, the community, as it were, than the wife who's home

10

QUESTION:

Our California courts recognize

And that's why this is so important.
So, she has -- under California law she

11

has an interest enough in the pension payments to keep him

12

from assigning the -- ?

QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I believe that she does.

Or from their

being attached?
MR. WINTERS:

Yes, sir.

I believe that that is so

17

inasmuch -- and this is only, now, this is only

18

situation where we have a community property situation.

19

it is quasi-community property, it's a completely different

20

situation because by the mere fact of entering into the

21

State of California, this in and of itself does not change

22

the property interest, but as far as California is concerned,

23

when you both worked for it, you're both entitled to it.

24

It's a property interest, Mr. Justice.

25

in

the
If

Now, of course, under quasi-community property we
26

1

have a different situation because under quasi-community

2

property they both must be domiciled there and, of course, it

3

has to be in a divorce situation only.

4

even though they both become domiciliaries, if they then

5

leave the State of California, California has no interest in

6

it anymore.

7

to differentiate in this type of a situation.

8

it is still very important for us to consider the fact that

9

the wife is an equal partner and should be considered an

10
11

In other words, again

And so I believe that it's very important for us
And I think

equal partner in this very important property right.
Now, I would like to make one very short statement

12

to this Court at this time, because yesterday when I came

13

here to Washington I visited Arlington Cemetery.

14

could not help but think of the millions of our brave fight­

15

ing men who sacrificed so much, and also the millions of

16

brave and patient women that they left behind, women who

17

spent their lonely and fearful days and nights waiting and

18

praying for their men to return home.

19

Justices, for their men’s homes, reared their men’s children,

20

and most Important, gave their men the courage and hope,

21

something to come home, something to fight for.

22

never turned our back on our fighting men.

23

this time, let us not now minimize the importance of their

24

courageous women.

25

QUESTION:

And I

These women provided,

We have

And I ask you at

Mr. Winter, in addition to the
27

1

conventional preemption arguments, it seemed to me that your

2

brother on the other side made another argument, i.e., that

3

California has misconceived what the nature of this property;

4

that instead of it being a run-of-the-mill pension such as

5

was involved in Hisquierdo or such as would be involved in a

6

General Electric pension, this instead of being deferred

7

compensation for present services on active duty is actually

8

compensation for more.limited services in retirement.

9

that's true, then it wouldn't even be the kind of property

And if

10

that's subject to the community property laws, quasi-commu­

1 1

nity property or any other kind, would it?

12

MR. WINTER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WINTER:

15

to another degree, Mr. Justice.

16

that we have to be somewhat realistic.
QUESTION:

17
18
19

Well, Mr. Justice -Wait, am I right in my assumption?
Yes, to some degree, but perhaps not
In the first place, I think

Of course we do.

We always have to be

that.
MR. WINTER:

The fact of the matter is, Mr. Justice

20

that the retired military officer doesn't really have to do

21

anything any more.

22

QUESTION:

23

assuming that's true?

24

MR. WINTER:

25

QUESTION:

Well, no, assuming that's true, I said,

Yes?
That what it is, what so-called
28

1

retirement pay is, is compensation for the more limited ser­

2

vices for which he is liable in retirement, and rather than

3

being deferred compensation for his services performed during

4

active duty.

5

MR. WINTER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WINTER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.
Now, assuming that's true?
But I don't think that -Let's not argue about whether or not it

is. Assuming it's true, then California would be quite mis­

10

taken in considering this property covered under its community

11

property doctrines, wouldn't it?

12

MR. WINTER:

Well, I think that our community pro­

13

perty law covers that in this way, Mr. Justice.

14

community property law, once there has been a separation then

15

the earnings of each of the spouses then becomes his or her

16

separate property.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WINTER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WINTER:

Under

Their subsequent earnings?
Their subsequent earnings.
Right.
So that if we assume counsel's argu­

21

ment, the way that I can answer that is really simply this,

22

the minute that he gets back into the military and he actually

23

becomes part of the active duty again, then he is paid --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WINTER:

Full pay.
-- number one, he is actually paid for
29

1

his services, the services that he renders at that time.

2

But furthermore, he also accrues further military retirement

3

benefits all of which will then benefit him.
QUESTION:

4

5

We're really now arguing about whether

or not it is true, the assumption, aren't we?
MR. WINTER:

6
7

So --

I don't think so, but perhaps I mis­

understand you.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WINTER:

Perhaps I misunderstood you.
I don't think that we're arguing about

10

whether or not it's true.

1 1

it would then be a property interest.

12

that you can't ignore one without the other.

13

depends upon how far you really have to go.

14

if he's factually only on limited duty, then I would have to

15

agree.

16

cases the courts have addressed that issue.

17

The question is whether or not
And what I'm saying is
Now, it just
If he's really,

But the fact of the matter is, and in one of our

QUESTION:

Mr. Winter, do you agree with what your

18

opponent said, in the event the doctor had not merely retired

19

but had resigned his commission, would he not then have for­

20

feited any right to the retirement pay?

21

MR. WINTER:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but that takes —
Would you not agree that he has the sole

23

discretion as to whether to do that, and the wife cannot veto

24

that decision?

25

MR. WINTER:

I believe that he has that sole
30

1

discretion or he should have that sole discretion, Mr. Justice

2

However, I would like to point out to the Court that under

3

the California scheme, under the California law, that the

4

wife actually has no greater right to the retirement than the

5

husband, or, I should say, actually, the spouse.

6

I'm talking about wife and husband here, because from a prac­

7

tical standpoint it has been that situation in 99 percent of

8

the cases.

Of course,

9

I might add parenthetically that now that we have

10

more and more women becoming part of the military, it could

11

easily cut the other way.

12

one moment, the wife in that particular situation has abso­

13

lutely no power at all to increase her right.

14

if the husband chooses to give the whole thing up, then cer­

15

tainly he can do that, and there is nothing that she can do

16

about it.

17

QUESTION:

But getting back to that for just

In other words,

But it's not just -- if your opponent's

18

conception of the scheme is the correct one, it's not merely

19

giving something up, he also gets something when he resigns,

20

namely, he is no longer exposed to the risk of being called

21

into active duty and running the risk of the danger that's

22

associated with a military life.

23

MR. WINTER:

Well, I'm not asking this Court to

24

state that the wife should have the right to tell him whether

25

or not he should remain in the service.
31

1

QUESTION:

No, but this goes to the question whe­

2

ther it's in the nature of a pension or it's in the nature of

3

reduced pay for a limited type of service, namely, availabil­

4

ity to recall.

5

HR. WINTER:

I believe that under these circum­

6

stances, Mr. Justice, I believe that this is nothing more thar

7

a play on words.

8

And while I agree that it isn't --

QUESTION:

But there are a number of officers who

9

do resign for that very reason.

10

MR. WINTER:

Yes.

And in the event that they resigr

11

then they for all intents and purposes will defeat their

12

spouse's interest, arid-that- takes care of that, she's out.

13

And I recognize that, Mr. Justice.

14

under those circumstances the Court should not have the power

15

to keep him in there, or to make him work, or do anything

16

that he doesn't want to do.

17

overall scheme, this is part of the community property law.

18

And we recognize that.

19

I certainly feel that

I personally disagree with that particular

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTANIAH EYTAN, ESQ.,

19

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT -- REBUTTAL

20

MR. EYTAN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, the wife can com­

21

pel the husband to pay her damages in the event he refuses to

22

resign.

23

a case that did not plough new ground at all, we had an Air

24

Force husband, Luciano v. Luciano, a 1980 case, where the Air

25

Force husband refused to resign from the Air Force and the

In the very recent case that my opponent mentioned,

35

1

wife claimed that she had the right to collect her property-

2

interest in his retired pay and never mind whether he wished

3

to actually start retired pay coming.

7

He refused to resign.

That is not involved in this case.
I'm sorry?
That question isn't involved in this

case?
MR. EYTAN:

14

That's correct.

The California court

15

determined that it was up to her to decide when the retired

16

pay would come, and that idea was further amplified in a more

17

recent case cited in my reply brief, that said that the hus­

18

band who refuses to retire so as to trigger the retirement

19

benefits has to pay damages to the wife in an amount equal

20

to what she would have gotten as her property interest had she

21

retired.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. EYTAN:

Is that like palimony?
Not at all.

It's a property interest.

24

It's not like alimony at all.

It's damages for someone

25

converting your property, someone depriving you of your
36

1

property.

California has had this doctrine a very long time,

2

and it's fundamentally based upon the notion that if you have

3

something within your control, you can trigger a set of conse­

4

quences or not.

5

the person who suffers thereby is entitled to damages from

6

you.

7

alimony.

She wants half the retired pay.

8

alimony.

The husband has custody of the three minor children,

9

the husband pays everything, she’s getting her alimony based

And if you choose not to trigger them, then

The wife in this case, may I point out, is getting
She's getting

10

upon a court determination of her need.

1 1

about needs, and if she has greater need at any time, she

12

can always go back to the courts and get more alimony if she

13

can sustain her burden of proof on that.
QUESTION:

14

This case is not

Is it fair to assume that if you win this

15

case the court would reassess the alimony situation and per­

16

haps give her a little more?
MR. EYTAN:

17

I think it’s fair to say that she has

18

the right to do so and if she can show need, the answer is,

19

yes.

20

she decides to pledge It to a financial institution or suppose

21

she decides to give it to her second husband if there is one,

22

never mind the specific fact here.

23

you get into the property business you allow the states to

24

determine that the wives can dispose of it by testamentary

25

disposition.

But imagine this.

Suppose she gets the money and then

She could pledge it.
37

The point is that once

Strangers start getting

1

the money.

Look, you have a new case here, In re Miller, as

2

to which cert, is pending.
The Miller court from Montana decided that the

3
4

wife has such a marvelous property interest in this that she

5

can give this to any person she wants by testamentary dispo­

6

sition.

7

ed that the Army retireee, perhaps languishing in a nursing

8

home, is going to share his retired pay with a second husband

9

who secured it by testamentary disposition?

Does anyone really believe that the Congress intend­

Has anyone

10

really considered that the Army intended for Army retired pay

11

to be so abused as a property interest that husbands who have

12

their retired pay taken away from them in substantial portions

13

have to seek out bankruptcy relief?

14

been happening.

15

you'll see the cases cited there.

That's exactly what's

If you take a look at the reply memorandum

Most importantly, I think that the statement that

16
17

there's no anti-assignment statute here a la Hisquierdo is

18

rot.

20

act text has changed from time to time but the essential

21

point is the same.

22

statute here, as in Hisquierdo, and when you consider that

23

it's the United States Government that has all the benefits

24

in this area, the pay, the retired pay, the social security,

25

the annuity programs, obviously an anti-assignment statute

There clearly is an anti-assignment statute.

There is

The ex­

an anti-assignment

in these circumstances for Army pay which the Congress pro­
