ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. GRISWOLD:

8

This is an antitrust case in the health care area.

9

May It please the Court:

The issue turns on the construction of the National Health

10

Planning and Resource Development Act of 1974.

11

tional question is involved.
The statute is long and diffuse.

12
13
14
15

No constitu­

The respondents

rely on 28 fairly general words In the statute as the basis for
their contention that they have implied immunity from the anti­
trust laws.

We contend that there is no room for such a con­

struction.
16

The district court accepted the implied immunity

17

argument and granted summary judgment for the respondents.
18

That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the 8th
19

Circuit and this Court granted certiorari to review that deci­
20

sion .
21

The question arises on these facts.

National Gerimedi

22

23

A participating hos­

pital receives di.rect reimbursement of 100 percent for covered
services rendered1 to individual Blue Cross members.

If the

hospital is not granted participation, then Blue Cross pays no
16

more than 80 percent of the cost of the services and it makes
17

the payment directly to the subscriber and not to the hospital.
18

A lack of participating hospital status discourages Blue Cross
19

subscribers and their doctors from seeking service at National
20

Gerimedical and places the hospital at a substantial competi­
21

tive disadvantage .
22

QUESTION:

But in a sense it would place the consumer

23

in the long run at an advantage, would it not, in that a lot of
24

unneeded medical facilities would not be built?
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

MR. GRISWOLD:

That may or may not be the case.

The

2

question is whether there is any statutory authorization, state

3

or federal, for restricting the construction of this hospital.

4

And it is, as I have said, Missouri had no certificate of need

5

legislation at the relevant time here.

6

gal or inappropriate about the building of this hospital, and

7

the question really is whether Congress by passing this statute

8
9
10

11

There was nothing ille­

has authorized private groups to enforce that approach to the
question of the cost of medical care which you have suggested,
and our position is that Congress has made no such authoriza­
tion .
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Griswold, does the state even now have

a statewide planning agency?
13

MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes.

The state now has a statewide

14

planning agency.
15

QUESTION:

When did that come into being?

16

MR. GRISWOLD:

Effective October, 1980.

And under it

QUESTION:

5

I would guess it would be under the

Well, does it involve federal money going

to the state?
MR. GRISWOLD:

6

The states are encouraged by the stat­

7

ute to have a state health planning and development agency

8

which would have power to grant certificates of need, but the

9

states are not required to have that.
QUESTION:

10

11

If a state says, I don't want anything to

do with this, I don't want to participate in this program at
all, nevertheless, you think the statute is applicable in the

12

state, in the sense that the regional planning agency should be
13
14

formed?
MR. GRISWOLD:

On the

contrary,

our position is that

15

the statute is not applicable in the state unless the -16

MR. GRISWOLD:

QUESTION:

But they didn't intend it to be?

21

MR. GRISWOLD:

But they didn't intend it to, and I

22

didn't quite complete my answer, which is that there is a para­
23

graph in the statute which says that if the state doesn't choose
24

to have a state agency, then it will not get certain grants.
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

6

1

But there is no requirement that the state take those grants,

2

and Missouri deliberately chose not to take those grants and

3

chose not to have a state planning agency.

4

QUESTION: Is it your position that this regional

5

planning agency, one of the named coconspirators, what's --

6

the initials are too complicated --

7

QUESTION:

M-A-H-.S-A.

8

QUESTION:

But is it your position that that agency

9
10

11

had no authority to operate under the federal law at all be­
cause the state hadn't chosen to -- ?
MR. GRISWOLD:

It had authority to operate under the

federal law for the purpose of making plans and recommendations.
12
13

QUESTION:

Even though the state didn't want anything

to do with this at the time -- with the statute?
14

MR. GRISWOLD:

It seems to me it's a little like the

15

American Law Institute which proposes a federal securities code.
16

The federal securities code has no significance, no meaning, no
17

binding effect, unless Congress chooses to enact it.

Congress

18

has not so far chosen to enact it.

There are two groups under

19

the statute, health systems agencies, and in this case that is
20

the lower group.

In this case the health systems agency was a

21

purely private, nongovernmental organization.
22

The statute also provides that there can be, if the
23

state wants, a state health planning and development agency,
24

which is required to be an agency of state government and which
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

is required to have governmental powers with provision for due

2

process in the exercise of those powers, and with provision for

3

court review of its decisions.

4

have such an agency and during the relevant period here

5

Missouri had no such agency.
QUESTION:

The state is not required to

Mr. Griswold, can I interrupt you to get

something out of the way for me?

a certificate of need is.

thing that the Federal Government says you've got to have before

certificate of need?

Why does the statute talk about it?

MR. GRISWOLD:

14

What is a

I'm not sure that I can answer that.

It is a -- it turns very heavily on what the state wants to
15

make it.

The state can provide that there can be no construc­

16

tion without a certificate of need, and then with proper due
17

process and proper procedure for appellate review, that can be
18

binding and can be enforced in the state, in the courts.
19

QUESTION:

Isn't one of the objectives, Mr. Griswold,

20

to avoid the proliferation of unused beds?
21

MR. GRISWOLD:

That is the reason for having a certify

22

cate of need statute, but Missouri didn't have one and chose
23

not to have one.

Congress provided that there could be agen­

24

cies in states which would have certificate of need power, that

1

the Secretary could make contracts with them, and if the

2

Secretary did make contracts with them, then the states would

3

be eligible for certain federal funds.
QUESTION:

4

Do

you suggest that the situation might

5

be different now after the 1980 development?

6

a planning -- .
MR. GRISWOLD:

7

Missouri now has

Missouri now has a planning, but it also

8

has a statute which says that National Gerimedical shall be

9

deemed to have a certificate of need.

10

refuses to accept it as a participating hospital.
Now, the refusal of Blue Cross appears in the record

11
12
13
14

And yet Blue Cross still

on page 169, the letter from Blue Cross to National Gerimedical.
"After deliberation the Board of Trustees voted unanimously at
the Blue Cross Board meeting of March 21 to deny Blue Cross
member hospital status to the National Gerimedical Hospital

15

because your institution did not receive approval through the
16

health planning process."
17

And I repeat that that health planning process to
18

which reference was made was that of a purely private agency,
19

MAHSA, Mid-America Health Planning Association, acting in con­
20

cert with the Blue Cross associations which are also purely
21

private.

Neither had any governmental power.

And I think this

22

appears most clearly on page 147 of the record, which is a
23

brochure put out by Blue Cross in 1976 or '-7, about two inches
24

above the bottom of the page:

"Since the state planning agency

25

local health systems agency for approval of such capital pro­

"All projects not reviewed and approved by these health

Kansas City."

And I repeat again, that MAHSA and Blue Cross are

purely private agencies which do not exercise governmental
power.
Now, the respondents here rely on a provision of the
statute which is set out on page 2 of our blue brief, and at
various other places in the brief, which provides that "A health
systems agency shall implement its" -- and this is the statutory
wording — "HSP" -- which I put in brackets,means, health sys­

5

tems plan -- "and AIP" -- which is annual implementation plan -6

"and in implementing the plans it shall perform at least the
7

following functions:

(1)

The agency shall seek, to the extent

8

practicable, to implement its HSP and AIP with the assistance of
9

individuals and public and private entities in its health ser­
20

vice area."
2

And the respondents say, look, that’s all we did.
22

just complied with that provision.

There was a plan and we

23

undertook to help MAHSA implement it.

overdid things a little bit on page, the bottom part of page

8a of the Appendix, where we repeated a part of Section 300m.

It begins at the bottom of page 4a and continues to 8a, and then
16

we started over again with 300m..

QUESTION:

Psychologically sound.

18

MR. GRISWOLD:

And if the Court will cross out the

19

bottom two-thirds of page 8a and the top half of page 9a it
20

will avoid a confusion for which I apologize.
21

QUESTION:

Now, let's see, that's strike out all of

22

(b) and (1) at 8a, is it, Mr. Griswold?
23

MR. GRISWOLD:

On 8a, you strike out everything below

24

the black letter heading, "Section 300m."

QUESTION:

Is this a commitment not to charge this as

a taxable cost if you prevail?
MR. GRISWOLD:

3

We certainly cannot appropriately,

4

except that briefs don't come within taxable costs, and so I'm

5

afraid we'll have to pay for it.
Now, in the statute Congress set up a planning struc­

6

7

ture in several tiers.

8

Council on Health Planning and Development,

and then there

9

are statewide health coordinating councils.

They are to take

10
11
12
13
14

At the very top there is a National

care of a situation like Missouri where there's one group in
St. Louis and another group in Kansas City, so there's a state­
wide one which coordinates them.

Neither of these is involved

in this case, and I have not included in the Appendix the statu­
tory provisions relating to them.

But when the statute is

examined it becomes clear that the key distinction is between
15

the next two tiers of agencies.

These are health system

16

agencies, HSA, on the one hand, and state health planning and
17

development agencies on the other.

I have found from my work

18

on this case that it is very easy to confuse them, and I suggest
19

to the Court that it is very important not to confuse them, that
20

they are different agencies with different functions, and
21

MAHSA -- Mid-America Health Planning Agency -- is a health
22

systems agency and not a state health planning and development
23

agency.
24

Now, the codifiers in the U.S. Code have, helped out a

25

North American Reporting

12

1

little bit because the health systems agencies are all in the

2

300L

3

in print because it looks like "one" so we've put it in italics.

4

But there are several sections printed in the Appendix through,

5

near the bottom of page 4a, which are

sections.

7

Now "ell" becomes confusing when you put it

300L's,

and they all

But Congress knew that state health planning and

8

development agencies were something very different, and in the

9

codification-

they are in the

300m

sections.

And they begin

10

at the bottom of page 4a and continue to the page 15a in the

11

Appendix.

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

Now, if you will look at Section 300L-l(b)(l)
which is on the first page of the Appendix, you will see that a
health systems agency for a health service area must be one of
three types of entities.

It can be (a) a nonprofit private

corporation, and that's what MAHSA is, Mid-American Health
Planning Agency is a nonprofit private corporation.

It can also

be a public regional planning body or it can be a single unit
of general local government.
Under subsequent

But MAHSA is not one of those.
provisions in the

300L

sections,

20

health systems agencies including MAHSA are given what I call
21

grass roots responsibility.

Their basic function is to gather

22

information and make recommendations.

This is shown by the

23

passage in the Senate report which is printed on the bottom half
24

of page four of our brief.

The report says that the

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

13

1

responsibilities of the health systems agencies are the accumu­

2

lation of data in order to assess the existing status of the

3

health care delivery system in the area it serves, and develop­

4

ing short and long-term recommendations in order to achieve the

5

rational and equitable distribution of personal health care

6

services throughout its planning agency area.

7

An important part in the legislative history is the

8

Senate report which is printed on page five of our reply brief,

9

where the Senate said that "the establishment of priorities

10
11
2
3
4

within the state" -- the Senate committee said -- "the estab­
lishment of priorities within the state and the performance of
regulatory functions are most appropriately carried out at the
state level.

The latter function" -- namely, regulatory func­

tions -- "can appropriately be carried only by an agency of
state government."

And that was repeated in another Senate

5

report and a House report at the same time said, "The Committee
6

feels that regulatory activities are appropriately vested in
7

units of state government."
8

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Griswold, what if the Missouri

9

Legislature had taken up a proposal for the formation of a
20

state regulatory body and come to the conclusion that 95 percent
21

of Missourians were Christian Scientists, and so they simply
22

didn't want anything to do with this and they didn't want any
23

hospital building in the state;

and so they enacted a statute

24

saying, there will be no hospitals constructed in the state for
25
North American Reporting

14

1

two years?

2

MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, then they would have determined

3

by legislative action the policy of the State of Missouri.

4

only question would be the constitutionality of that statute,

5

and subject to some qualifications about retroactivity and

6

things of that kind, it would seem to me that it would be found

7

to be constitutional.

8

made no provision for certificate of need, for restricting the

9

construction of hospitals.

10

11
12

15

But here Missouri made no enactment; it

That has been done solely by these

private agencies here, which it is our contention are not au­
thorized by any state or federal statute, and there is no basis
for an implied immunity under the antitrust laws.
QUESTION:

13
14

The

You wouldn't think that, apparently, that

Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical enactment was a valid zoning
ordinance?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, I think it would be very similar

16
to enacting a valid zoning ordinance.

That's why I said I

17
thought such a statute, except for conceivable things about
18
retroactivity, the hospital was half built when the statute was
19
passed, or something like that, bond issues had been put out,
20

that it would be valid.
21

Now we come to the provision of the statute relating
22

the state health planning and development agencies, and these
23
are all in the 300m

sections.

And the important thing to note

24
here is that these are not agencies set up by Congress.

Now, let me point out Section 300m(b)(l), which is on

"A state health planning and development agency must

be an agency of the government of that state, selected by the

19

is to administer the state administrative program."

It has to

20

be an agency which has the authority and resources to adminis­

ter the program, and has a budget.
22

Then, in Section 300m(l), "A state administrative

program is a program for the performance within the state by

sion or indication in the federal law that if Blue Cross had

chosen to make a contract with this hospital, despite the refu­
sal of a certificate of need from MAHSA, that there would have

16

been no violation of federal law?
17

MR. GRISWOLD:

Well, let me say, MAHSA never refused

18

to issue a certificate of need.
19

QUESTION:

Well, assume it had, though.

20
MR. GRISWOLD:

Assume it had?

That would be simply

21

two private groups agreeing together that they would -22

QUESTION:

Yes, but suppose MAHSA had refused to

23

certify this, what did it do that led Blue Cross to refuse to
24

make the contract?

Blue Cross read it as meaning --

that this facility wasn't needed, exactly the way it read it
now, but had said, well, nevertheless, we're going to make a
contract with the -- that would not have violated any federal
law?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

No, it wouldn't have violated any --

It might have made MAHSA mad but --

MR. GRISWOLD:

It would not have violated any federal

15

or state law whatever.

QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, supposing, though, that

17

Missouri had authorized the program and then the planning agency
18

whatever its proper name is, refused to designate the hospital,
19

give It the certificate, and thereafter Blue Cross entered Into
20
the contract with them.

Then would it ha've violated federal law?

In

21

other words,.if you had a state program in place and the state
22

program did not certify a new hospital, would the federal
23

statute be violated if Blue Cross decided to insure the hospital

MR. GRISWOLD:

The federal funds are cut off from the

state only if it doesn't have a state health planning and
development agency.
QUESTION:

In the case of -Well, then,

cording to federal rules.
5

MR. GRISWOLD:

In the case put by Justice Stevens,

6

the state has a state health plan, so the state funds would not
7

be cut off.

The extent to which funds would be cut off from

this hospital would turn on other federal laws.

It is my

9

understanding that there were not federal funds in this hospi­
20

tal, that it was built by the nonprofit group which conducts
2

the hospital.
22

I would suggest to the Court that the distinction
23

between health systems agencies and state health planning and
24

development agencies is crucial to this case.

Health systems

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, JR., ESO.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

9

MR. McCREE:

10

11

The judgment below

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The statutory scheme that Mr. Griswold described

12

resulted in, of course, the 8th Circuit determining that there
13

was an implied exemption created by this national health plan­
14

ning and resources development statute from the impact of the
15

antitrust laws, because there was a repugnancy between the
16

statute, which was enacted subsequent to the antitrust laws,
17

which of course have been fundamental laws in this country since
18

1980, at least the Sherman Antitrust Act has.
19

We do not contend that there can never be implied
20

exemption from the antitrust laws, but we are mindful that the
21

teachings of this Court are that an implication from, an implied
22

exemption from a regulatory statute is strongly disfavored and
23

would be found only in cases of a plain repugnancy between the
24

antitrust acts and the regulatory provisions.
25

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

20

QUESTION:

1

Do you think this disfavor of implied re­

2

peal is stronger in the case of antitrust laws than In the case

3

of other regulatory laws?

4

MR. McCREE:

I think it may well be, perhaps, just

5

because of their age and their fundamental nature.

6

think we have to decide that here.

11

QUESTION:

How about the Logan Act, passed in 1796?

MR. McCREE:
cide that here.

But I don't

Well, I just don't think we have to de­

I think the principles would be the same.

If

the Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and then enacts
subsequent legislation, if there is a conflict it's the duty of
the Court to try to give meaning to both statutes.

And if the

2

Court cannot give meaning to both statutes because of a plain
3

repugnancy, then it will find that the later statute pro tanto,
4

by implication, modified the earlier one.

And so I don't think

5

it makes any difference for the problem of statutory construc­
6

tion whether we're talking about the Logan Act or the Sherman
7

Act or Capper-Volstead, or whatever it is.
8

We contend here that there is no plain repugnancy,
9

and that this Court's attention to this matter can really be
20

concluded at that point.
2

The Joint Appendix contains, of

course, the opinion of the 8th Circuit, which adopts, after

22

making its own ascertainment of repugnancy, the findings of the
23

district court.
24

I would

like to direct the attention of the Court to

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

21

1

page 187a of the Joint Appendix, in the sentence just before

2

the paragraph break about a quarter of a page down, and with

3

leave of the Court I'd like to read that sentence if I may.
The district judge wrote, "If the court were to find

4
5

that private business working in conjunction with a health

6

systems agency established by the Act in their area to achieve

7

the goals of the Act were liable or might be liable under the

8
9
10

antitrust law for their actions, then the court believes that
the accomplishment of the purpose of the goals of the Act would
be effectively foreclosed."
Now, that's as close as either of these courts gets

11
12
13

to the finding of a plain repugnancy, and yet on several occa­
sions this Court has held that activities which come clearly
within the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency nevertheless may

14

be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws.
15

As Mr. Griswold has pointed out, the National Health
16

Planning and Resource Development Act of 1974, which is the
17

basic piece of legislation here, created two types,

at least

18

two types of agencies; one, the health systems agency, of which
19

MAHSA, the Mid-America Health Systems Agency -- which was, inci­
20

dentally, a multistate agency -- is one; and it created the
21

state agency, or authorized the creation of a state agency which,
22

as he pointed out, didn't exist at this time.

All the first

23

type of agency, the health systems agency, could do is plan and
24

recommend.

It could do nothing more than plan and recommend.

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL

REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

22

1

And the district court, and subsequently the Court of Appeals

2

for the 8th Circuit, found that respondent here, who is accused

3

of having conspired with MAHSA and others to prevent the entry

4

of petitioner into a hospital agreement, to prevent petitioner

5

and Blue' Cross from entering into an agreement, somehow violated

6

a regulatory scheme with a clear and plain repugnancy.

7

just isn't so.

8

with the health systems agency, and if a private party like

9

Blue Cross in this case is immune from the antitrust acts, just

10

11
12
13
14

And that

Because all the Act required was cooperation

because it does what it thinks a health planning agency would
like it to do, and at that point the approval of this Court,
we've moved a long way from cases like United States v. RCA,
California v. FPC, U.S. v.

Borden Company, Silver v. New York

Stock Exchange, where there was strict regulation by an agency,
and yet the Court found a place for the application of the

15

antitrust laws.
16

We contend that in the absence of a strict repugnancy
17

the Court can conclude its consideration of this matter here,
18

because there isn't any repugnancy between the activities of the
19

health systems agency and the antitrust laws.
20
QUESTION;

General McCree, was there any finding in

21

the district court or court of appeals that the actions of the
22
Blue Cross in effect violated the antitrust acts here, or was
23

it just the whole thing turned on whether they were exempt from
24

the antitrust acts?
25

GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

23

1

MR. McCREE:

The latter, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The

2

posture of the case as it went to the 8th Circuit was on summary

3

judgment and the court assumed it to be true that this was a

4

wrongful refusal to deal in violation of Sections 1 and 2.

5

And the case would have to go back if this Court agrees that

6

there is no implied exemption from the antitrust laws to see

7

whether petitioner can actually establish it.

8

accept it for the purposes of this litigation.
QUESTION:

9

10
11
12
13
14

But we have to

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask the same

question I asked Mr. Griswold, what is your understanding of
the statutory purpose of a certificate of need?

Does it relate

merely to eligibility for federal funding or is it a condition,
a federal prohibition against the building of new hospitals
without such a certificate?
MR. McCREE:

Well, first let me say that I'm not al­

15

together clear either in my understanding of it, but it is not,
16

it is not a compulsion of the Federal Government, which was part
17

of Mr. Justice Stevens' inquiry, because it can only be accom­
18

plished by a state agency which was not in place at the relevant
19

time of the refusal, alleged refusal to deal here, but it has
20

since come into being.

It would be a refusal by the state, and

21

I suppose it would be possibly to accredit it, to permit it to
22

perform.
23

QUESTION:

Well, let me rephrase the question.

Sup­

24

posing you had a state agency and it granted one hospital a
25
North American Reporting

1

certificate of need and another one it did not.

2

the first one could get federal funding and all sorts of things.

3

The second one, I assume, would not be eligible for federal

4

funds but would it violate any federal law if it nevertheless

5

went ahead and offered its hospital services available to the

6

general public?

MR. McCREE:
would violate.

And I assume

I'm not aware of any federal law that it

My answer is no; I'm not aware of any.

QUESTION:

Nor would it violate a federal law if Blue

Cross made a contract with it?
MR. McCREE:

I would agree with that too.

no federal law that would violate.

I know of

But we're in an area here

where it's necessary to determine whether Congress intended by
Implication to exempt certain private activity which is to be

14

totally unregulated from the impact of the antitrust laws.
15

And we submit that this Court has never done that.

I can't

16

think of a single instance where this Court by implication has
17

found that the Congress by implication meant to enable a private
18

party to do the things forbidden by the antitrust acts when
19

there was no other regulatory scheme imposed to promote competi­
20

tive activity.
21

And we say it's particularly, the error is particu­
22

larly egregious here because in this National Health Planning
23

Act the Congress made express exemptions from the antitrust
24

laws and did not exempt the behavior condemned here.
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

25

1

It expressly in 1974 exempted, or immunized, and in a qualified

2

way, too, because it was for good faith and nonnegligent activi­

3

ty, individuals who would participate in a health systems plan­

4

ning activity from money damages only, and not from injunctive

5

relief.

6

just for money damages, to the health systems agencies and spe­

7

cifically rejected an effort on the part of the Senate to immu­

8

nize persons who might cooperate with them, which would have

9

been, possibly, Blue Cross in this instance.

10
11

Subsequently, in 1979, it extended the immunity, again

And we set these

matters out on pages 25 through 27 in the Government's brief,
and we say that where there is an express exemption this Court
should be reluctant to find an implied blanket exemption which

2

3

would be broader than the qualified exemption expressly made
by the Congress.

4

We think that the Congress was certainly concerned
5

with delivering quality health services at reasonable cost to
6

the American people, but that it did not intend it to be done
7

in disregard of the antitrust laws, that It intended the
8

antitrust laws to coexist except to the extent that it made
9

express exceptions with its planning system, which is set out
20

in the statute that Mr. Griswold described in his argument to
21

the Court.

If there are no further questions, we will rest on

our brief.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA F. GREENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

MR. GREENBERG:

1
2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The intent of Congress in the Health Planning Act of

3
4

1974 was deliberately anticompetitive.

5

statute itself was fashion health systems agencies throughout

6
7
8

the nation and it directed that each one draft a plan, a plan
which would blueprint the future development and structure of
health systems in the various communities.
Congress directed

9

11

What Congress did in the

in the statutory words that the

agencies reduce documented inefficiencies.

It was the statutory

test -- these are words in the statute -- to prevent unnecessary
duplication of health resources.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Greenberg, under what authority did

13

Congress take that action?
14

MR. GREENBERG:

I think that the authority was

15

generally under the spending authority.

There were grants made

16

to the states; rather substantial grants are made to the states.
17

It also —
18

QUESTION:

It simply provided that if the states didn’t

19

comply they would not get the funding?
20

MR. GREENBERG:

That is correct; that is correct.

21

Lest there be any doubt, there is no claim here that there
22

will be a violation of federal law if Blue Cross does not go
23

along.
24

That is not our point.

Our point is one of cooperation,

and cooperation within the statutory scheme established by

25

27

Congress in order to effectuate a particular result.

Now we'll try to tack with you.

These are short words.

Mr. Griswold

seems concerned that there are only 28 words on which we rely.

6

Having been trained in the antitrust laws I am used to short

7

statutes.

8
9

10

11

There are 28 words.
These statutory words, words like planning, reduce

documented inefficiencies, prevent unnecessary duplication,
are plainly antithetical to all of antitrust.
nothing that could be more antithetical.

There could be

Solicitor General

talks about a promotion of competitive activity.

There was no

12

talk of any kind, none whatsoever, in the 1974 act, which is
13

the only act before this Court, about competitive activity.
14

There's not a whisper of it, not in the legislative history, not
15

in the statute.

Everything that Congress wanted to do in 1974

16

was deliberately anticompetitive.
17

Now, petitioner's reply brief, at page 4, note 1,
18

relies on a House report on the 1974 act and petitioner argues
19

that there is no indication that Congress understood, as they
20

put it, "planning to be synonymous with cartel regulation."
21

However, that same 1974 House report at pages 60 and 61 dis­
22

cusses the key provision here with respect to implementation.
23

Words that were in the House bill at the time that finally be­
24

came incorporated in those very same words in the final act.

like to quote.

"The planning done by HSAs is

These are not two separate activities,

Petitioner sees a difference between planning and

8

implementation.

The 1974 House report on which petitioner

9

relied did not.

Now, lest there be any doubt here I would like

10

11
12
13
14

to quote further from that House report. It puts it this way and
it makes very clear the two-track system which Congress had to
adopt in 1974, makes its point this way.

"The apparently

modest initial means of implementing health plans seeking the
assistance of individuals and entities in the health service
area to do so is in fact the most important method available.

15

Without credibility in the community and close working rela­
16

tionships" -- close working relationships -- "with those who
17

operate the health system guided change will be impossible."
18

Then the House report goes on, putting away any
19

lingering doubt:

"The governing body" -- they're talking now

20

about the governing body of the health systems agency -21

"should include representation of third party payers" -- third
22

party payers like Blue Cross -- "who once the plans are drawn
23

can assist the agency in implementing them."

These are the

24

words of the Congress.

"Without close working relationships

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

30

1

with those who operate the health system guided change will be

2

impossible."

3

Those are the words of a Congress that wanted to

4

repeal the antitrust laws.

5

it didn't say anything about it because in 1974, if we take

6

that slice of time, nobody thought that the antitrust laws

7

applied in this business.

8

was before Royal Drug, it was before Goldfarb.

9

the furthest thing in anyone's mind.

We've had the petitioner,

we've had the Solicitor General, we have an amicus, we have our
particular group.

No one has found a word in the 1974 legisla­

tive history suggesting that anyone wanted any kind of antitrust
or competition.

All of the legislative history says, there

are too many beds, it's adding to cost.

If you build a bed It

gets filled up, and we don't want it.
15

The the House report talks about third party payers
16

who once the plans are drawn can assist the agency in imple­
17

menting them.

Those are the facts of this case, and those are

18

facts which, with respect, are glossed over by the petitioner,
19

and are also glossed over by the Solicitor General.
20

We are not asking for a blanket exemption here.

What

21

we're asking for is an implied repeal with respect to the very
22

specific facts of this very case.
23

QUESTION:

What is the scope, Mr. Greenberg, of the

24

implied repeal.

In other words, would it cover a group, say, a

group of contractors who refuse to enter into a contract with a

2

new hospital unless it first got a certificate of need?
MR. GREENBERG:

3

With respect, sir, the certificate of

4

need is only a matter of state law, and I think it points up

5

what was going on here.
QUESTION:

6

7
8

There was no provision at the time of the

operative facts here for a state certificate of need.

Am I

correct?
MR. GREENBERG:

9

10

Again --

That's absolutely correct.

And, in­

deed, there were no certificates -QUESTION:

11

So there was none, but there couldn't have

been any?
12

MR. GREENBERG:

Pardon me?

13

QUESTION:

There was no certificate of need, but there

couldn't have been any?

There could have been a certificate of

16

need in Missouri.

There could have been a certificate of need

Absolutely; did

not have one.
19

QUESTION:

So what is the scope of the exemption that

20

you contend existed in Missouri in the year in question here?
21

MR. GREENBERG:

The scope of the exemption should be

5

to the very complaint -QUESTION:

7

is the exemption that you contend Congress created?

QUESTION:

MR. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

15

17

What I want to know is, what is the scope

of the situation they had in mind to grant an exemption?

14

16

I think they had in mind this situa­

tion, this kind of situation, where the health systems --

12
13

I don't

I understand.

What is it?

And the health --

Just an exemption for Blue

Cross ?
MR. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

Oh, no; oh, no.

Would it cover then, say, a group of con­

18

tractors who refuse to build a hospital or a group of doctors
19

who refuse to offer their services unless they get -- would it
20

cover all kinds of collusive activity or cooperative activity
21

QUESTION:

There's no statutory finding that I've

nothing in the statute.

MR. GREENBERG:

The point that we make is,

the issue before the Court, with respect, is to take the slice

of time in 1974 and say, what did that Congress that passed the

4

National Health Planning Act of 1974 intend with respect to the

5

antitrust laws?

6

and not just what is here irrelevant, Section "m" , a different

section from what's involved, but rather if one reads the

statutory purposes in the "L" sections that have to do with

13

And we think that by reading the entire statute

that Congress said, we want to do it two ways.
say they wanted to do it two ways?

Why did they

The reason was, again,

taking the slice of time in 1974, the states didn't have certifi'
cate of need statutes yet.
QUESTION:

14

This was two alternative ways?

MR. GREENBERG:

That's correct.

Two -- and that's

15

what the House report makes very explicit and I think is very
16

clear from the statute, and is also clear from the Senate report
17

In 1974 Congress said, let's get on with it, let's stop this
18

proliferation of hospital beds, but we can't force states to go

enact certificate of need laws, and they gave them four years to

One of the words that the petitioner is very interested

in is "to the extent practicable."

To the extent practicable.

And what petitioner does in its brief is it incorporates a lot
16

of baggage on top of "to the extent practicable."

It says,

17

what "to the extent practicable" Congress meant was, except in­
18

sofar as the antitrust laws are concerned.

Well, let me read

19

from another section of the law, the 1974 law now, 42 U.S.
20

Code 300-1(a)(2), which is not in any of the briefs at this
21

point.

But it says that, "to the extent practicable the area

22

shall Include at least one center for the provision of highly
23

specialized health services."

What Congress is talking about

24

there is how big the health systems agency can be.
25
North American Reportinq
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

43

It couldn't

be clearer if one reads the entire Act that "to the extent

practicable" means what it means to everyone:

and not insofar as the antitrust laws are violated.

QUESTION:

Mr. Greenberg, suppose that MAHSA instead

sumers.

And the staff had to be funded by -- all the staff was

funded, at least 90 percent were, by the Federal Government.
22

The problem the petitioner has is. that MAHSA doesn't look
23

exactly like the SEC. It isn't composed only of federal employ­
24

ees.

But what it had on it was volunteers, all volunteers --

QUESTION:

So you're saying this is no different than

if the statute had authorized the secretary of one of the
departments to go out in the field and try to talk people,
private parties into preventing excess hospital beds, and the
Secretary of Health went out to the pharmaceutical convention
and persuaded them not to sell to the new hospital?
MR. GREENBERG:

That is what Congress wanted.

That»s

11

what it said.
12

qQUESTION:

And so you think, then, that the phar­

13

maceutical people, although they weren't required to do that at
14

all, by the federal law, and couldn't have been told to do it
15

by the Secretary, they're nevertheless exempt?
16

MR. GREENBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Greenberg, suppose -- I'll try a hypo­

18

thetical -- that the Federal Government, the Congress, developed
19

the idea erroneously or otherwise, that the country needed more
20

lawyers, and provided for $500 million for matching grants to
21
22
23
24

the states to build additional law schools but required

that

no grant would be made to a state unless the bar association
of that state certified that there was a need for a law school
and specified the size and capacity of that law school.

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

Would you think there'd be some analogy with what you've got

2

here?
MR. GREENBERG:

3

With respect, no.

Because wholly

4

apart from the problem of hospitals and too many lawyers --

5

I'd rather not get into that -- the point here is that your

6

analogy relates to the certificate of need arrangement insofar

7

as the states are concerned.

8

there already were a number of certificate of need programs in

9

essay.

10

11
12
13
14

What's going on here was that

Not in Missouri, to be sure, and Congress in 1974

didn't want to foul up that arrangement in the various states.
It was very sensitive to those certificate of need arrangements
that have been adopted in a number of states.

What it wanted

to do was to get all the other states to adopt certificate of
need legislation and in fact that's what happened.
QUESTION:

Well, is there any analogy with respect to

15

a bar association being a private entity as against a govern­
16

mental entity, and yet having in mind that the bar association
17

would probably be about as qualified to determine need for a
18

new law school as anyone could possibly be?
19

MR. GREENBERG:

If what Congress did, as I said, we

20

will establish you and we want you to go this route, bar asso­
21

ciations, and we're going to supervise you -- which were the
22

facts here -- by the Attorney General of the United States, then
23

you would have an analogy to what we have here.

exclusive reason we're turning you down -- that's what the
20
complaint says, the sole and exclusive reason we're turning you

down is because MAHSA has not said you need it.

What was

Blue Cross supposed to do in that situation, then?

QUESTION:

Well, all I'd suggest is you're confusing

2

two different problems.

3

the antitrust laws, which we don't have to decide, and secondly

4

whether, assuming there was a violation.

5

that they could have done exactly what they did without violat­

6
7
8
9

10

11

One is whether there's a violation of

I mean, it may well be

ing the antitrust laws.
MR. GREENBERG:

That's correct.

I'd rather not get

into that but for present purposes, obviously, we're assuming
a violation of the antitrust laws.

Otherwise we don't have to

reach this point.
In its reply brief petitioner states that all involved
in 1979 would have been quite surprised to hear that Congress

12

had already impliedly repealed the antitrust laws. Nevertheless,
13

the Solicitor General in his amicus brief states unequivocally
14

at page 16, note 11 -- I'd like to quote:

"To be sure, there

15

are some activities that must" -- must -- "by implication be
16

immune from antitrust attack, if HSAs and state agencies are to
17

exercise their authorized powers."
18

So the Solicitor General concedes that there would be
19

repeal of antitrust by implication when private parties assist
20

the HSAs in developing plans.

But that's not all.

The Solici­

21

tor General goes on:
22

"There may be occasions in implementing" -- note, he

23

uses the word "implementing" and not just "recommended" -- "in
24

implementing health systems plans when an implied exemption

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

50

1

might be necessary in order to effectuate the statutory scheme

2

as required by Congress."

3

In a

word, what the Solicitor is conceding here is

4

that there's room for a narrow, implied exemption from anti­

5

trust.

6

Court, not a blanket exemption, not somebody who's interested

7

in goals and goes along and does things on their own, but on the

8

limited facts here, we have the agency making a determination

9

to avoid excess capacity, which it calls the number one priority

0

11
2

3
4

We say that the limited facts on the record before this

for implementation; where according to the complaint Blue Cross
designated the health systems agency as the agency to conduct
need review; and the hearing

of the agency, the Solicitor

General says at page 16, note 11, was public and open and
carefully supervised.

Not some private interloper; public and

open and carefully supervised, and the Solicitor General is
5

correct.
6

Now, it should also be emphasized that once the
7

Solicitor General concedes

that there is repeal of antitrust

8

by implication in some cases, this demolishes the rationale of
9

the expressio unius argument.

Expressio unius means that if

20

we said one thing, then everything else is out.

Now, this --

2

QUESTION:

If you accept that, you're in a little

22

trouble too.
23

HR. GREENBERG:

Pardon me?

24

QUESTION:

If you accept that, you're in a little

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

51

1

trouble too, because you said there was no antitrust involved.

2
3

MR. GREENBERG:

I said there was no antitrust involved

on the specific facts of this case.

4

QUESTION:

No, no.

I mean, when you're talking about

5

in 1974, when the statute was passed, they had no idea of

6

antitrust.

7

MR. GREENBERG:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GREENBERG:
QUESTION:

11

15

No, no, no.

Excuse me?

Oh, I misunderstood you.

MR. GREENBERG:

12

14

But you now say that you agree with the

Solicitor General, there were some, didn't you?

10

13

That's correct.

What the Solicitor General is saying,

the Solicitor General is acknowledging that there was some im­
plied repeal.

What we're saying is, we obviously disagree with

the Solicitor General as to where on the line that should be
cut, but once the Solicitor General acknowledges that there's

16

some implied repeal,

it's ' the

end

of

the

expressio unius

17

argument.
18

QUESTION:

Well, is your suggestion that after Blue

19

Cross had sat on the board of MAHSA

and the MAHSA as a unit had

20

said, the number one priority is oversupply of beds, it would
21

have been in effect reneging on its role in MAHSA if it had gone
22

ahead and paid the plaintiff in this case?
23

MR. GREENBERG:

It would have been encouraging another

24

120 unnecessary beds in the community, which would add to costs,
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

1

which would add to possible morbidity, mortality, and all of the

2

other things that MAHSA and most particularly that the Congress

3

of the United States found in the statute in 1974 and throughout

4

the legislative history.
QUESTION:

5

6

But It would have been no violation of

federal law if it had done that?
MR. GREENBERG:

7

That's correct.

The petitioner has

8

pointed out that at this time there is a certificate of need

9

legislation in Missouri.

10

11
12
13
14

Missouri for present purposes is the

49th state to have certificate of need legislation.

Only

Louisiana has held out, having before it the carrots of sub­
stantial federal funds.

The four years are up.

So what hap­

pens now is, the certificate of need legislation takes over,
and the other course, what the House report, House Report 1382
said, in 1974, the apparently modest initial means of implement­

15

ing now is no longer so important because now we have certifi­
16

cate of needs in the 49 states and just can't get to build a
17

hospital.

different and -21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GREENBERG:

-- it's hard enough going through the

23

'74 and '79 acts.

Each state is a little different, but as a

24

practical matter, what's happened today is that the building of

is in Missouri.

mind the problems of retroactivity.

Now, the petitioner says, well, Missouri has
They've

What they've done is they grandfathered it.

The petitioner goes outside

pointing out that whether or not there is a con­

tract at the present time with Blue Cross or not is not in the
record.

What is also not in the record is whether or not

petitioner has asked Blue Cross for a contract.

It is very

dangerous, as this Court well knows, to go outside records.

I

don't know the answer, and I don't know if petitioner does at
this point.

And in any event, it's not in this record, which

cuts off in 1978, before the 1979 act and before the Missouri
4

certificate of need legislation.
5

The petitioner's counsel talks about judicial review.
6

And the Solicitor General has made an argument in its brief at
7

various points, stating that the Health Planning Act specifi­
8

cally provides for judicial review of state certificate of need
9

determinations in state court, and that there is no similar
20

statutory provision for judicial review of health systems
2

agency determinations.
22

The premise of the Solicitor General is wrong.

The

23

citations at pages 9, 15, and 24 of the brief are all to the
24

1979 act, not to the 1974 act, which is the only act involved
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

54

1

2
3

here.

judicial review of state certificate of need provisions, so that
particular foundation falls apart.
Also overlooked here is the fact that the health

4
5

There was no provision in the 1974 act with respect to

systems agencies are directly answerable to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, and their health systems plans are

6
7

subject to review by the Secretary to assure that they conform
to national guidelines on such things as hospital beds per

8

capita and very relevant provisions.

If the Secretary's review

9

is unsatisfactory to any affected person, that person may then
10

seek judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.
11

Now, throughout here, the problem that petitioner has is it
12

never asked anyone to do anything.

It never went to MAHSA, it

13

never said, do you know, we have not an acute care hospital, we
14

just take care of the elderly?

And maybe your determination

15

with respect to acute care hospitals is wrong.
16

In its complaint it says it was very special.

It was

17

going to be a national hospital for the elderly.
18
19

20
21
22
23
24

They also

possibly could have gone to MAHSA and said, well, this little
suburb of Lee's Summit, where we're going to build our hospital,
they really need a hospital there, they really do.

And there­

fore you ought to give us, you ought to say, there's enough
beds, but we need another 120-bed hospital up there in Lee's
Summit.

It didn't do any of those things.

The fact that pe­

titioner doesn't ask doesn't eliminate the capacity to ask,

25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL. MEDICAL. LEGAL. GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

55

1

it doesn't eliminate the fact that there was complete due pro­

2

cess in terms of the promulgation of the plan and it doesn't

eliminate the fact this is not like Silver, it bears, no resem­

5

gone to MAHSA, it could have asked -- it might have been turned

In this situation the petitioner could have

i

6

down, but that doesn't eliminate the due process -- and then it,

7

could have gone up through the Secretary and then into court.
Particularly here, petitioner has pointed out that

8
9

10
11
12
13
14

there was only a conditional designation of the health systems
agency, a conditional designation meant there was a 90-day contract.
There

were

contracts

between the Secretary, Mr. Law, between

the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the MAHSA.

And

a contract meant money followed after you signed your contract.
That contract was cancellable in 90 days.

Petitioner could have

gone to the Secretary and said, along the lines of, cancel that
15

contract, give them 90 days notice, cancel them, because
16

there's a desperate need for a hospital here.

There isn't any

17

need for the hospital; there's no such thing.
18

Now, the petitioner in his reply brief quotes very
19

extensively at page 10 from Undersecretary Hale Champion.

If

20

one reads what is said there, it is quite clear that Mr. Champion
21

in that slice of time said, there is indeed implied repeal from
22

antitrust laws in some situations; this is what he says.

The

23

concern is misplaced.

If the agency itself considers the ques­

24

tions and makes the decisions based on an institutions's specific
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING. TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

56

1

kind of data, then we don't think, we don't think there are any

2

antitrust questions involved.

3

back to the next paragraph in a moment -- then he says, "I think

4

in some cases there has been an effort to make people more wor­

5

ried about that subject than they ought to be.

6

present view."

7

Then he goes on -- I'll come

The place where Mr. Champion has a problem Is that the

8

agency delegates the responsibility.

9

our case topsy turvy.

10

11
12
13
14

That's our

sibility to Blue Cross.

That turns the facts in

■

The agency didn't delegate the respon­
Blue Cross, according to the complaint

here, delegated to the health systems agency.

Now, we're told

by petitioner, that the agency administering the planning act
had a specific interpretation and had it obviously escaped their
attention that there was any implied repeal?
With respect, petitioner has a very short memory.

15

In the brief of respondent, Blue Cross of Kansas
16

City, in reply to the brief of amicus curiae, there's a letter
17

from Secretary Harris to Attorney General Civiletti, and at
18

page 5 Secretary Harris says, "Both the district court and the
19

8th Circuit held that the Act provides an implied exemption froir
20

the antitrust laws for Blue Cross conduct and accordingly dis­
21

missed the complaint.

This is consistent with this Department's

22
legal interpretation of the Act and our policy for implementa­
23

tion of the Act."
24

Just as does the petitioner, we turn to the agency
25
North American Reporting
GENERAL REPORTING, TECHNICAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL, GEN. TRANSCRIPTION

57

1

administering the planning act for guidance as of that period of

2

time.
To conclude, the plain repugnancy of the Health

3
4

Planning Act of 1974 and the antitrust laws is illuminated by

5

the very discrete facts of this case.

6

in 1974, now -- Congress did not intend to visit possible anti­

7

trust liability on Blue Cross for cooperating with the local

8

health systems agency to implement that agency’s plan, which

9

found that excess hospital beds were leading to high financial

10

11
12
13

We submit that in 1974 --

cost for the community, not to speak of increased morbidity and
mortality.

No rational Congress would direct a health systems

agency to seek to implement a plan with the assistance of pro­
viders, providers like Blue Cross -- stated to be a provider in
the statute -- and then to intend to leave those providers ex­

14

posed to possible antitrust treble damages because it furnished
15

the assistance to the health systems agency.

Thank you.

That, of

course, is quite inconsistent with the statute which Congress

passed, because it did include in Section

dealing with exemption from liability.

paragraph (b)(1) a health systems agency shall not by reason of

the performance of any duty, function, or activity, required of

It is a

question related to what this Court has before it now in the
Maricopa County case coming from Arizona.

It may well be that

such agreements under these circumstances in the health care
area do not violate the antitrust law, not because they're

5

exempt but because the proper construction of the antitrust laws
6

is that they were not intended to be covered.
7

In this case Congress made it plain both in the

statute and in the committee reports that regulatory functions

could be exercised only by state health planning and development

agencies.

MAHSA had so such powers.

There's nothing under

do so not only finds no support in the statute but is a clear
