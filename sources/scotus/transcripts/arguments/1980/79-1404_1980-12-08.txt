MR. WARSHAW:

10

11

Mix''. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This action was commenced in May of 1974 by a resi­

12

dent at Pennhurst State School and Hospital.

13

complaint that plaintiff sought damages and sought improved

14

conditions at Pennhurst.

By her original

Pennhurst is one of ten state-owned and operated
institutions for the retarded in Pennsylvania.

It is located

approximately 30 miles from Philadelphia in ai rural setting
and facilities range from modern modular buildings to old
renovated hospital-type buildings.
At the time of 1 rial It had a population of approxi­
mately 1,230 patients.

That was down from 4,000 in the mid-'6C

to 1,900 in the early '70s, to 1,200 in 1977.
time it's staff was approximately 1,500.

At the same

Of its population,

approximately 7 5 percent, of that population was severely or
profoundly retarded.

That means an IQ of below 36, as compared.
4

.

1

to the genera], population of the retarded where only five per­

2

cent fit into that classification.

3

increased drastically as the population of Pennhurst decreased

4

and

5

nal complaint plaintiffs sought only damages and improved con­

6

ditions at Pennhurst, subsequently there vie re two additional

7

parties who joined by intervention.

8

Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens, added statu­

9

tory claims, added additional parties -- namely, the counties

deinstitutionalization

That is a number which

occurred.

While by the origi­

One of those parties, the

10

surrounding Pennhurst -- and in addition changed the request

1 1

for relief to one requesting the closing of Pennhurst, and an

12

order requiring the counties and the state to create and fund

13

community placements for a] 1 residents at Pen.nhi.irst and all

14

those awaiting placement at Pennhurst.

15

At approximately the same time the second intervenor

16

was, of course, the United States, which mirrored the constitu­

17

tional claims of the original plaintiff.

18

time the district court certified a class which consisted of

19

those at Pennhurst and those on the waiting list at Pennhurst,

20

approximately 2 ,000 persons, and in addition anyone who might,

21

in the future be admitted to Pennhurst.

22

At about the same

In December of 1977 after tidal in the spring of

23

1977, the district court issued its opinion and finding, find­

24

ing that Pennhurst did violate the constitutional and one

25

statutory right of the plaintiffs.
5

The statutory right was

1

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

2
3

QUESTION:

Would that have been dispositive in itself

or not?

4

MR. WARSHAW:

Section 504?

I believe, as decided by

5

the district court it would have required the closing of

6

Pennhurst.

7

that Pennhurst as a large, isolated institution --

8
9

It mirrored its equal protection finding which was

QUESTION:

Would the result have been the same if

the constitutional claim had not been reached?
MR. WARSHAW:

10

I'm not sure that there would have

1 1

been a right to treatment, under 5 04.

12

a right not to be excluded from community activities and

13

federal programs --

14

QUESTION:

15

I think there was simply

So the right to treatment is constitu­

tionally based, is that the holding?

16

MR. WARSHAW:

17

QUESTION:

By the district court.

But, you've indicated that the district

18

court relied on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth

19

Amendment.

20

MR. WARSHAW:

21

QUESTION:

22
23
24

25

Yes, sir.

What if any other provisions of the Con­

stitution di.d the court rely on?

Quo Theory of right to treatment.

MR. WARSHAW:

9

Yes, sir, and also the Eighth Amend­

As incorporated in'the Fourteenth.
Yes, sir.

Of course, we're not reviewing that judg­

ment, are we?
MR. WARSHAW:

Those holdings in our understanding

are not before the Court today.

Because the -- well, I

10

should also describe the order of the district court.

11

order of the district court was that Pennhurst be closed, that

12

the State and counties create community placements for all

13

those at Pennhurst, and all those 2,000 on its waiting list;

14

and that a master supervise and direct those activities as

15

well as the interim operation of Pennhurst.

16

The Court of Appeals broke entirely new ground.

It

25

QUESTION:

under

Mr. Warshaw, with respect to the Court cf

Appeals' opinion, what power to legislate do ycu understand
it though-; that Congress was acting under when it passed this
Developmental Act?
MR. WARSHAW:

As I read the. opinion, it found it

unnecessary tc reach the Fourteenth Amendment question and
7

1

found that the spending power had been exercised.

2

QUESTION:

If it's simply the spending power, isn't

3

the ordinary remedy for the violation of the spending power

4

the cutting off of funds?

5

MR. WARSHAW:

That is part of cur position, cer­

6

tainly.

7

late the conditions of those federal

8

remedy is to cut off the federal funds, if in fact a violation

9

is found.

10

The violation here is to use federal funds and vio­
funds.

Therefore the

That is our position on the remedy; yes, sir.
QUESTION:

If the State of Pennsylvania simply threw

11

up its hands and said, this whole problem is just insoluble;

12

we can't cope with it.

13

let things be cared 'for' as they were1 100 years ago or 150 years

14

ago, would you think a constitutional question would arise?
MR. WARSHAW:

15

So, we'll close all the institutions an d

No, sir, I think, both the courts -- as

16

I understand it, certain.!.y the district court

17

there is no affirmative constitutional right to provide treat-

18

men!:.

19

meet certain standards.

20

there would be no constitutional problem if Pennsylvania de­

21

cided -- as it is not likely to do, of course -- that it would

22

drop mental reta.rda.tion services.

24

25

What it said was, in essence was, if you do, you must

23

recognized that

I think the answer to that is, no,

Did the district court rely at all upon

the Developmentally Disabled

Assistance and Bill of Rights

Act?

MR. WARSHAW:

2

QUESTION:

3

Excuse me?

Did the district court rely at a]1 upon

that statute?

MR. WARSHAW:

No, sir.

It was in the final amended

6

8

QUESTION:

12

And.there was no basis in the district

MR. WARSHAW:

It was considered by the district

court.
QUESTION:

Well, the new statutory basis was briefed

13

in the Court of Appeals, though?

10
1 1

It was, so far as I know, not briefed post trial.

Yes, it was, on the request --

At the request of the Court of Appeals?
-- of the Court of Appeals.

None of

the parties asserted it in their original briefs.
QUESTION:

Well, in any of the briefs, at that stage,

was there any claim that the Developmental and Disabled Act

20

rested on any power other than the spending power?

21

any claim that it was a congressional effort tc enforce either

22
23
24

25

Was there

the Eighth Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause or the
Due Process Clause?
MR. WARSHAW:

I don't think anybody -- there are

references to Katzenbach, which of course would be the relevant

decision in the series of voting rights cases.

the briefs to expressly assert the exercise of that power.

QUESTION:

You read them that way here, though, don't

you?

5

MR. WARSHAW:

6

QUESTION:

7

Excuse me?

You read the briefs here to make that

claim, don't you?
MR. WARSHAW:

8
9

I don't read

Yes, sir, I do.

I think at least one

of the respondents certainly claimed that this was an exercise

10

of the Fourteenth Amendment power.

1 1

they cite the case and in that particular brief, which is the

12

PARC brief, the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens

13

brief; they refer to Katzenbach.

14

they go along they then contend that this is a statute which

15

sets conditions for all federal funding.

MR. WARSHAW:

Do you feel compelled to respond to that

18

20

Once again, not directly,

To the constitutional argument?

To that very argument that you just are

reciting.
MR. WARSHAW:

The argument that it is a condition of

all federal funding?
QUESTION:

No, that it's a -- that this statute is an

exercise of some power ether than the spending power.
MR. WARSHAW:

Your Honor, yes.
10

First of all, on the

1

2

basis of statutory construction, and that is that the statute
will not stand that construction.

In finding — arid perhaps

3

it's best to discuss the statute -- in finding a right to

4

treatment In this statute, the: Court of Appeals focused on a

5

section entitled "Congressional Findings Respecting the Rights

6

of the Developmental]y Disabled."

7

I think the most important point to remember is that

8

this Court has never found substantive rights in congressional

9

findings.

Congressional findings set a predicate for congres­

10

sional action and for the courts they provide a means of in­

1 1

terpreting the substantive provisions of congressional acts.

12

They do not create rights in and of themselves.

13

this Court noted In Southeastern Community Col.'l ege v. Davis,

14

when Congress intends to impose rights, it knows how to do so.

15

And genera]ly, as this Court also noted, in Harris v. McRae,

16

when it does so it provides funding to assist in the implemen­

17

tation of those obligations.

18

to Section 6010.

19

In this case it did neither, as

In stark contrast, when it imposed obligations --anc

20

once again, this is my point:

21

not, on its face, go beyond the funding.

Certainly as

QUESTION:

the obligations in the Act do

Though those are really two discrete

questions, aren't they?
MR. WARSHAW:

Yes, sir.

And I think you have to

answer' the first adversely to us, which is a point I can't
11

1

reach, I just don't think you can answer that first question

2

adversely to us, namely that the Act goes beyond the funding

3

under the statute before you even reach the constitutional

4

issue.

5

pose conditions beyond funding under the: Act, could the:y have

6

done so?

7

secondly, that they could not.

8

And that is the power, if Congress had wished to im­

And we contend, first, that they die not.

QUESTION:

And,

General Warshaw, where is the text of

9

6010 upon which the --

10

MR. WARSHAW;

It is cited throughout the briefs.

1 1

I was referring in there to the Joint Appendix on the Writ of

12

Certiorari, which was submitted as the appendix, as part of

13

the appendix in this case.

14

QUESTION:

Where, if you know, the page?

MR. WARSHAW:

Excuse me.

It's on page 198(a).

is the more complete version.

Once again, in stark contrast to Section 6010, when
Congress intended to impose conditions under this Act and
impose obligations, it did so clearly, it did so by -- and it
also provided funding for those ob]igations.

It did provide

funding for protection and advocacy systems, saying tha1 the
12

1

developmental]y disabled should have available counsel and

2

advocacy services to protect their rights in social security

3

matter’s, in constitutional matter’s, in the federal courts and

4

the state courts, and administrative hearings, and they re­

5

quired the states to meet certain conditions in establishing

6

that program.

7

And, explicitly, the conditions of that funding are attached

8

to the funding.

9

But they die provide funding for that as well.

Secondly, they provided for

certain kinds of spe­

10

cial projects.

Once again conditions of those special pro­

1 1

jects are conditioned on receiving funding and the conditions

12

are explicit.
Finally, they provided funding for states which wish

13

14

to participate in the planning, coordination, and provision

15

of services advantages of the Act.

to improve their services

The planning and coordination aspect is

The Act serves an important

It does not serve the broad purposes attributed to it
It does not impose the kinds of

obligations that that court found.
Finally, I think there are two additional points.
First, when this Court interprets federal statutes, I think it
14

1

does defer to the view of the Federal Government, but when it

2

does so the view of the Federal Government that it defers to

3

is the view of those which are charged with implementing the

4

statute:.

5

they inplemented this statote, there are several problems.

6

Indeed none of their activities, none of the:ir actions support

7

the view of the Court of Appeals or the view of the respon­

8

dents in this case.

And if you look a^ those views as manifested by how

First of all, Pennsylvania hats received uninterrupted,

9

10

funding under the Development.ally Disabled Act.

1 1

HHS does not believe we violated that Act.

12

regulations provide no support for' the preposition that 6010

13

is mandatory.

14

standards for institutions.

Secondly, the;

It describes those, its references to deinsti-

Thirdly, to the extent that any­

the Act, HHS again does not agree and neither do we, because tljey

19

have supplied uninterrupted and substantial funding for Perm-

20

hurst. .

21
22
23
24

25

Finally, at the time of trial, and perhaps even today,
to the extent that the thrust -- and this provided a thrust.,
or is argued to provide a total thrust for federal funding,
the Federal Government was making it extremely difficult -and the record is clear on this -- if not impossible to receive
16

1

funding for community placements.

2

QUESTION:

Is your argument that if the administra­

3

tive agency charged with, enforcing the Act that the Court of

4

Appeals construed and applied, if the administrative agency

5

charged with that enforcement had done, had ordered what the

6

Court of Appeals ordered as a condition fcr federal funding,

7

would you say that they would have exceeded their powers in

8

this area?
MR. WARSHAW:

Yes, sir, I would have.

Before you leave the Section 6010, is it

not correct that Section 6010(3) describes an obligation?

MR. KITTREDGE:

That's exactly right; quite; I do,

I think you can at least logically make some kind of a

distinction between 6010(3)

of obligations, and 6010(1.) and (2).

and even if Congress purported to create rights and duties,

7

there's a question of its power, isn't there?

MR. KITTREDGE:

Oh, absolutely, sir.

Absolutely.

9

The Court of Appeals in its discussion of the constitutional

10

predicate for this particular section as It was construing it

1 1

mentioned both the spending power■in Section 5 of the ‘Four­

12

teenth Amendment -- I must confess it is not clear, at least

13

to me, which of those predicates the 3rd Circuit relied on.

14

In any event, it makes no sense at all to rely on the spending

15

power, because if in fact the spending power is the sole

16

predicate for that enactment, there are two results.

17

all, there's no showing for a finding by the district court

18

that any of the counties are recipients of

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

First of

DD Act funds.

And secondly, even if you assume that everybody in­
volved in this litigation was in fact a recipient cf DD Act
funds, the result of the finding, a reading of 6010 such as in
the court below, would simply result in every state disdaining
DD Act monies from now on.

They would wsilk away from it.

They would look at the enormous obligations created by what
the 3rd Circuit has declared, they would look at the de minimis
23

1

funding provided under the DD Act, and I Fean that in a rela­

2

tive sense, and they would simply say, no, thank you.

MR. KITTRED6E:

How many states have accepted these funds';
I believe that all 50 have.

MR. KITTREDGE:

I believe, in Saturday's paper, it

was reported that the State of Virginia has tcld the Federal

QUESTION:

10

Isn't the second ground of the Court of

If you assume that the constitutional

predicate of 6010 as found by the court below is the Four­
teenth Amendment and the

enforcement ; power in Section 5 of

the Fourteenth Amendment, then you have to determine what it
is, what is the Fourteenth Amendment right that is being en­
forced?

MR. KLEIN:

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Mr. Justice Stewart, I agree that the issue, is the

7

rights and the concomitant duties, and I think the question

8

here is legally enforceable rights as distinguished from the

9

variety of vague ways in which the term is used.

10

I think it helps in understanding the analysis to

1 1

take a precise look ait what the Court of Appeals found as to

12

the legally enforceable rights under this statute.

13

all, it found that for each person at Fennhurst as well as on

14

the waiting list, you have to have an individual determination

15

by a court or master as to the appropriateness of an institu­

16

tion as compared to a community facility.

17

court- or master-determined.

18
19

First of

This has to be

Secondly, in that determination there is a legal
presumption in favor of community placement.

Now, as a practi­

20

cal matter, the way this works in Pennsylvania is, the court

21

has established a Master's Office.

22

is an office of more than ten people that is now' operating the

23

system in Pennsylvania..

This is not a master.

To date it has cost approximately

MR. KLEIN:

The

district court ordered the State to pay those monies and the

6

State is currently paying them, sir.

7

This office hats an office at Pennhurst and it reviews

8

all the actions out the;re.

In addition, it has devised a

9

systemic community placement program.

It also works with the

devise community services for each individual.

if there is no objection,

16

there is yet a second master who has been appointed, called

you have to prove if you object to the community placement,

19

that this community placement would be worse than Pennhurst.

And again, there is noth­

Congress often describes

10

findings and then goes on to implement them.

1 1

makes broad statements of rights, clearly not legally enforce­

12

able rights, but it went, on to implement them in the statute

13

in a way different, perhaps, from that which the respondents

14

would urge, and in a certain way more modest, but in our view

15

much more sensible.
First, as to the issue of deinstitutionalization,

16

17

18
19

that is, the Court of App»ea! s felt that Congress wanted these
individual determinations

22

and virtually everyone in the com­

munity .
Congress in 1975 had two very specific requirements.

20
21

And here it.

First, it asked the states as part of their plan to devise a
plan tc eliminate inappropriate institutionalization and also
to improve condi tions for those

for

whom

institutional -

23
24

ization

was

necessary.

At that point Congress said, the;

states have an obligation under this Act, a concrete legal
25

30

1

obligation to devote at least ten percent in 1976 of their

2

monies for deinstitutionalization under the Act; that is, ten

3

percent of the federal grant, and in later years they have to

4

devote 30 percent of the federal grant.
And Congress realized that deinstitutionalization was

5

6

costly and the legislative history says, in fact, we therefore

7

appiropiriate additional funds so that the states will have the

8

monies from their ten percent and in later years 30 percent.
Now that is an important and by no means insigniii-

9

10

cant step which, neverthelsss, is not the one the Court of

11

Appeals found.

12

because in 1978 Congress amended the Act -- this was before the

13

Court of Appeals decision in '79. It did

14

things for present purposes.

15

for a plan for deinstitutionalization.

16

years, the institutionalization had taken place; again,

17

at a rate, perhaps, different than the Respondents would

18

prefer.

two very significant

One, it eliminated the mandate
They had had three

But it had taken place.
Second of all, they eliminated the earmark provision.

19

20

However, the legislative history goes further,

Rather, they said, now -QUESTION:

MR. KLEIN:

22

Eliminated what?
The earmarking funds for deinstitution­

They said, rather, you've got four priority areas

23

under the DD Act, and you can put your money in any one of
24

these,

sixty-five percent of the federal grant.

25

31

'

And the four

1

areas were case management services, child development ser­

2

vices , community living services, or non-vocational social

3

development services.

4

Without going into the details of what those are,

5

it's clear that the states in '78 forward could continue to

6

target DD monies for deinstitutionalization.

7

that they could move in entirely different, areas, and indeed

8

the Court of Appeals, of course, has moved them in exactly the

9

opposite direction.

It's also clear

Congress made it clear that a.ll the monies

10

under the DD Act could be used for institutional improvements,

1 1

and the quote from the legislative history is "increasing the

12

capacity of institutions and agencies to provide or coordinate

13

services or to train personnel."
So it's very clear that Congress spoke on the issues

14

15
16
17

that the Court of Appeals tried to extrapolate upon, only it
spoke in a way that declares very different policy than others
might have.
QUESTION:

18
19

20

21
22
23

Could Congress have prescribed al.1 of the

conditions and limitations which the Court of Appeals has laid
down?
MR. KLEIN:

I think, Your Honor, Congress could

describe conditions as a condition of funding, so long as
those conditions in themselves were not unconstitutional.
I have no question that so long -- that is, Congress, I as­

24

sume, like the rest of us,

could say, if you want federal

25

32

1

funds, you have to meet certain conditions.

QUESTION:

And,

Well, Mr. Klein, you say this is just a

conditional program, a grants-on-condition.

But are the con­

ditions directly enforceable in your view, in court, without
action by the agency?
MR. KLEIN:

Mr. Justice White, if the conditions are

as I describe them, they're not directly enforceable in court.
Of course, the welfare conditions in Rosado are enforceable,
but the remedy is different.

If the conditions are as the

Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circui.t said they were, then I
think under Thiboutot you can enforce those.

However, we

33

1

confers entitlements, and I'm making an alternative argument

2

that, if it did, contrary to our opinion, that nevertheless

3

the relief should have been as designed in Rosado.

4

Now, going on in terms of what those conditions were ,

5

if you look at the conference report, the legislative history

6

in '75, Congress made ciear that the bill of rights and the

7

sections that follow it -- you see there were three titles to

8

the bill; Title II came out of the Senate bill, and it was a

9

bill that had elaborate standards for’ all facilities. The House:

10

had no such provision.

They compromised and the compromise

1 1

came out with a three-section Title II:

12

was these findings; 6011 on the individual habilitation

13

plans; and 6012 on creating a protection and advocacy service.

Section 6010, which

And Congress specifically said in the conference

14

15

report, 6010 -- and this is the language -- "specifies rights,

16

requires habilitation plans, and requires protection in advo­

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

cacy."

So I think it's quite clear that Congress understood

the difference between a declaration or description

and the

imposing of a legal right or a legal duty.
Moreover, in the report, it talks about the discrete
standards of 6010(3), as Your Honor, Justice Stevens, asked
about, and it says, as to those:

"In themselves we realize

they' will not insure quality treatment or habilitation.
fore, we have no intent.ion to displace or supplant other
higher standards either’ required by the Medicaid statutes

25

34

There­

1

or1 other state statutes."

2
3

So, again, throughout, Congress saw the limited pur­
pose that was involved here.

4

Now, I think the final, if there were any doubt

5

about the inappropriateness of what went on below, Congress

6

right in the opening sections of the statutes specifically

eschews

What we have here is a massive federal take­

over.
One last point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think you

12

have raised the constitutional issue in a variety of contexts,

13

and I think that's an issue that comes up in part because in

14

order to make this a mandate that's enforceable other than for

15

the option of fund cutoffs, it would have to be pursuant to

16

Fourteen and five, it seems to me.

17

Now, it's clear that the Court of Appeals somehow

18

thought it didn't have to reach that issue.

19

Court needn't reach that issue, or the constitutional issue,

20
21

22
23
24

25

if it agrees with our reading of the statute.

Of course, this

I would only

say that the law, it seems to me is clear, and we would cer­
tainly welcome resolution of the constitutional issue rather
than a remand.

We could not bring it to this Court because

the Court of Appeals rested its opinion on a narrow statutory
ground; respondents chose not tc seek the Constitution as an
35

1

alternative ground fom affirmance.

2

that the United States Constitution does not require the

3

states to devise an alternative, system of care and to invoke

4

any such requirement as the least restrictive alternative.

But I think it is clear

In 1970, in State v. Sanchez, this Court dismissed

5

6

for want of a substantial federal question that issue.

7

No federal district ccourt -- and the Court is aware that

8

It has never happened, and as I

13

So I think this Court, if it deems it appropriate,

14

has to reach an issue, can go right ahead to each issue, and

15

we welcome resolution of it.

Thank you, Your Honor.

tions for’ the retarded cannot be encompassed in any recital of
the abuse and neglect uhich the lower courts found at
Pennhurst.

Because tlhe enforced inactivity, the; unbroken

aloneness, pale besidee the central fact that brings us to this

court, and that fact is the affirmative regression and harms

2

caused to people at Pennhurst.

3

that people at Pennhurst there for retardation habilitation

4

go backwards; people become more retarded.

5

that they had when they entered the institution.

6

in essence is a lack of life, a lack of the challenges and

7

changes and questions that life presents to us that we need,

8

and retarded people equally need, to develop.

9

the retarded is what is called the denial of habilitation.

Mr. Ferleger, you say that it's this

MR.

FERLEGER:

Would you say you

We would have been in this Court on

constitutional grounds had Congress not enacted the Act after
I filed the lav/suit in 19 74.
QUESTION:

Well, in other words, you're saying that

the Constitution requires each state to provide some sort of
care for the type of people you describe?
MR. FERLEGER:

We’re saying that the Constitution

requires the states to provide protection from denial of par­
ticular constitutional rights, which include the right to
habilitation.
QUESTION:

Well, what provision of the Constitution

24

do you get tha+ from?

that the State of Pennsylvania could, or any other state, conic,

MR.

13
14

15
16

17

18

22

Well, a denial of a right to care

once someone is in a retardation program is, I think, different
than a refusal of the state to create such ai program.

What

we have here are people institutionalized, already harmed by
the state, already subjected, in Jackson v.

Indiana's words,

"tc institutionalization the purpose and the nature and dura­
tion of which have no relation to its purpose."
QUESTION:

20
21

FERLEGER:

What if, unlike Jackson v.

But even -Indiana, the

state simply had never set about to create any sort of insti­
tutions for the mentally retarded?

Would you say that the

FERLEGER:

Yes, we do.

We join in defending the

particular issue, because under the standards enunciated most

14

recently in Fullilove and related cases, this Court has found

15

that Congress may elaborate, on Fourteenth Amendment protec­

16

tions through enforcing the Amendment under the Section 5.

17

And theit sort of enforcement, remedial enforcement, is exactly

18

what the Congress intended to do in enacting the Developmental

on the basis that the State of Pennsylvania has millions of
dollars unspent that it could just as easily transfer to the
kind of facilities you wish.

It has to be something applicable

to all fifty states.
MR. FERLEGER:

I don't agree.

I think that this

Court can find, and in fact it appears from the argument so
far to be conceded, that people at Pennhurst have been denied
habilitation.

Once that judicial determination of liability

is made, the nex1: question is remedy.
40

And as to remedy,

1

I believe, as we explain in our brief, that the remedy for

various states.

5

The nature of the crea­

Pennsylvania, it happens, has funds available, has

a program in place, and the creation of an IHP, individual

master is not doing it.

Pennsylvania is doing it and has done

it, and from all indications in the record intended to close

Pennhurst by 1983.

12

I submit, is an easy one, and the liability question appears

to be virtually conceded.

MR. FERLEGER:

They said that because they rested

it on that they don't have to reach the more difficult ques­

14

tions -QUESTION:

15

The spending power generally is, it's

16

well established, that Congress can grant, as to a state --

17

accepts the federal help, the bridge has to meet those speci­

And then if the state

That is correct.

That the offer of federal aid under this program is not nearly

QUESTION:

7

My only point is that before you answer,

the money expended by the Federal Government under this pro­

9

the grant.
MR. FERI.EGER:

And that is why Congress said, we are

12

creating the Dl) program to meld, in Congress's words, "into a

13

cohesive client-centered thrust" all the other’ multi-habil i-

QUESTION:

You think this is a post-Medicaid imposi­

tion of a condition on the receipt of Medicaid, for example?
MR. FERLEGER:

This is a requirement that the funds

under Medicaid, funds which go to Pennhurst, for example, be
used to provide habilitation, not to make people regress.
QUESTION:

So your position is that any state that

is bound by what you say, 6010 of

2

MR. FERLEGER:

QUESTION:

Yes.

But even if that be true, what do you

4

do with Justice Harlan's language of Rosado v. Wyman, where

5

he says that if you don't like it , just don't take the funds?

6

MR. FERLEGER:

He doesn't quite say that.

He says

7

in Rosado v. Wyman that the plaintiffs below are entitled to

8

an injunction saying, no funds.

9

Justice Harlan say that that's the only remedy.

Nowhere in that opinion does
And in fact,

10

the; district court had in that case issued an order to the

1 1

staH e regarding the benefits and the: question of whether no

12

funds is the only remedy was not before the C.curt in Rosado.
QUESTION:

13
14

Wouldn't you say the strong implication

of the Rosado opinion is just a cutoff of funds?
MR. FERLEGER:

15

I don't think so, Your Honor,

16

because in Lau v. Nichols the Court said -- and Chief Justice

17

Burger's opinion in Fullilove in a 'Separate section repeats the.

language -- that affirmative relief is possible and required

So, Rosado is irrelevant if you're right

on the Section 5?

6

MR. FERLEGER:

7

QUESTION:

Section 5?

That's correct.

Well, there are all sorts of affirmative

8

obligations if a state voluntarily accepts the conditions of

9

of welfare, of a highway program, or of building a bridge.

10

But the state has an option to accept the federal grant under

1 1

those conditions or not to accept it a+ all.

12

MR. FERLEGER:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's established.

But here the condi­

14

tions were hardly made clear when Medicaid was enacted, for

15

example.

20
21

22
23
24

MR. FERLEGER:

For example.

But under the DD Act

Congress can create obligations.
QUESTION:

After, after the: original grant?

MR. FERLEGER:

Wei], Medicaid is one example, and

it seeras - QUESTION:

Can Congress in 1960 say, we grant you X

million dollars on these conditions and the state accepts the
money on those conditions and complies with the conditions,
and then in 1970 can Congress come along and impose additional
conditions upon the 1960 grant?

25

45

That's the question here,

1

isn’t it?

2

MR. FERLEGER:

Not upon the 1960 funds, but upon

3

all the funds that continue -- $3 billion this year -- to pour

4

into these institutions, Congress can impose those conditions,

5

and change the condii ions, as Congress does frequently.

6

QUESTION:

May I ask a question along those lines?

7

May a state withdraw entirely, now, from any federal support

8

for this sort of program?
MR. FERLEGER:

9

10

That's a difficult question,

Mr. Justice Powell, because

1 1

QUESTION:

What is your answer- to it?

12

MR. FERLEGER:

Although it’s not raised by this

13

case, my answer would be that a state could only withdraw i.f

it assured that the people who had been and are being benefitec

15

by the funds are not harmed.
QUESTION:

The difficulty of the question is that

currently receiving services, I think, would need to

be assured of a lack of further’ harm for the state to withdraw.
QUESTION:

20

21

How would it do that?

MR. FERLEGER:

17

The di.ffaculty that that would --

I've understood you to argue that,

you're talking about constitutional rights, if they are con­
stitutional rights, even if a state withdrew, do you suggest a
federal court would be

obligated to construe end apply those

rights ?
24

MR. FERLEGER:

I think a court would be obligated.

HR. FERLEGER:

The current lav.7, because of Goldy v.

Beal, a case striking down the commitment statute, the current
law cited in my brief, Goldy v. Beal and implementing regula­
tions, is that no one can be committed by a court to Pennhurst
or a.ny other retardation institution unless there's a finding
that no community service can be made available.

That is a

state regulation and a consent decree issued by a federal court:.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS RESPONDENT

12

MR. DAYS:

In fact, it specifically says they

But it doesn't necessarily say, close

And that is --

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
While many members of the Court have addressed ques­

16

tions to my colleagues about the extent tc which the DD Act

17

and the rights recognized under 6010 flow from the Constitu­

18

tion, particularly the; Fourteenth Amendment and Section 5,

19

it is the position of the United States that insofar as this

20

particular case is concerned the spending power i s the only

21

22
23
24

25

issue before the Court, and there is no reason to address the
extent to which Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment might
justify the affording of the rights that are contained in 6010.
Congress passed the DD Act because it wanted tc

under conditions that produced regression and brought affirma­

It decided upon the course that it

The thrust of 6010 can be understood, we submit,
only by looking at the legislative history, looking at whatt

10

the two houses of Congress initially

1 1

and how the compromise that produced the1. DD Act came about.

12

The Senate in 1974 and '75 was concerned with the

attempted to achieve

13

extent tc which people in institutions like Pennhurst were

14

having their rights, both constitutional and civil rights,

15

violated.

16

sions such as Judge Johnson's decision in the Wyatt series of

17

cases, decisions with respect to WiDlowbrook, and other insti­

18

tutions around the country.

19

and debates that focused on this question of the rights of

20

people; in institutions and how they could be protected.

It made these determinations based upon court deci­

It also had legislative hearings

The Sene.te bill ultimately contained the section
called Title II, and it was entitled, the bill of rights.

It

contained detailed specifications with respect to standards
for the prevision of care, not only to the institutionalized,
but to people in community-based services for the

developmentally disabled as well.

over 400 pages.

The House version, in contrast, was very consistent

5

with what Congress had done in the past, since 1963, in

6

response to a message from President John Kennedy that there

7

was a need to move away from institutionalization of mental]y

8

retarded people to community treatment.in which, essentially,

9

what the Government did was provide funds tc the states that

10

they were willing to accept certain conditions.

1 1

that if those conditions were not met, then the funds would be

12

cut off.

13

and how to insure: that those funds provided under the DD Act

14

would be adequately utilized.

15

It was clear

So this focus was on how to provide additional funds

But I think the legislative history reflects the

16

fact that both houses were concerned about conditions in

17

institutions where individuals were subjected to inhumane

conditions and nonhabilitative situations.

the ability to walk, the ability to reason -- because this

anything in the evidence that demonstrates that it is the

custody that has caused that, or is it possible that that was

the natural course of the unfortunate condition?

8
9

MR. DAYS:

This record, Mr. Chief Justice, speaks

very strongly to the point that however Pennsylvania officials

10

have tried to fix up Pennhurst, the conditions recur.

1 1

have been efforts since 1950 to paint up and fix up Pennhurst,

12

but as the experts and other observers who testified in this

13

case revealed, there is something about that isolated congre­

14

gate facility that tends to produce, the conditions that time

15

and time again were found by people who visited Pennhurst.

16

It was not something that --

what is there in the record to demonstrate that

a

particu­

lar patient who has suffered regression, may not have suffered
that same regression if they had stayed at home, or been some­
where else?
MR. DAYS:

I think there is evidence in this record.

Your Honor, that the fact that people in Pennhurst were not
23
24

cared for, were not attended to, produced the type of regres­
sion that they experienced.

There were children who went into

25

56

1

Pennhurst who were able to say a few words before they went

2

there and when their parents came to visit, them a couple of

3

weeks or a couple of months later1, they could not speak.

There were children who could walk who were left in positions

5

on the fjoor such that their limbs atrophied.

7

able to do very rudimentary reasoning steps that no longer

were available to them after they were in Pennhurst for awhile,

clear]y the result of the institution --

1 1

inmates, by persons in the; institution upon other persons, by

12

staff upon the residents,

13

by the institutionalization, not a natural consequence of the

14

lack of development of those persons in Pennhurst.

15

reflects that had they stayed at home they probably would have

16

been in better position now than they have been after, as the

17

record shows, an average of 21 years in an institution.

Mr.

And if I may emphasize,

Chief Justice, we are. not here urging this Court, or in
57

1

fact the lower courts, to make policy determinations, to make

2

technical medical determinations.

3

Court is that Congress made these determinations after over a

4

decade of considering these problems. After some four years of

5

hearings about conditions in these institutions, it had

6

reached the judgment that something more than providing funds

7

had to be. done by the Congress, there had to be an affirmative

8

effort to protect the rights of people who were found in in­

stitutions like Pennhurst.

to make about
QUESTION:

Whether cr not the Congress knows you

are, or not.
MR. DAYS:

I have a distinct impression that the

Congress does know that I'm here, but the point I wanted to
make was to rebut something that was said by Mr. Warshaw. We
did get into this case before the DD Act existed, and that was

24

known to HEW, it was known to the Secretary.
25

60

And secondly,

1

it is not true that the agency has continued to provide Medi­

2

caid funds to Pennhurst unmindful of the terrible conditions

3

in that institution.

4

of the 40 units at Pennhurst have been certified under Medi­

5

caid, and what the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania wants to do is

6

spend $4 million to try to fix up the institution so it can

7

qualify for Medicaid funds.

was concerned was this lawsuit that --

that contrary to Mr. Warshaw's suggestion, it is not just the

MR. DAYS:

As we suggested in our brief, Mr. Justice

White, if the Court believes that the DD Act does not provide
an adequate basis for the relief below, we think that a remand

is appropriate, so that the Court of Appeals can address the

constitutional questions.

Getting back to the legislative history of this Act -

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Days, before you proceed, perhaps

5

you can help me on this question.

Is the Government’s only

6

interest the result of federal funds being implicated?

7

talking now about a legal interest?

I’m

8

MR. DAYS:

That's correct.

9

QUESTION:

Is it your position that that’s entirely

10

on the statute and the acceptance by the government of federal

11

monies ?

12

MR. DAYS:

That is correct.

13

QUESTION:

In other words, you're not making any

14

15
16

17
18

19

20

21
22

constitutional claim at a] 1?
MR. DAYS:
Mr. Justice Powell.

Let me explain our intervention,
We intervened expressing the various

interests of the United States and the interest of the United
States was in the fact that substantial amounts of federal
funds were going to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under
circumstances that appeared to produce harm for the people in
the institution.

So that was our reason for becoming in­

volved; we. did not go into the case merely because we were
theoretically interested in constitutional questions.

23

QUESTION:

But Mr, Days, couldn’t you have prevented

24

that somehow within the executive branch?
25

63

If one arm of the

1

executive branch was doling out these funds and the Justice-

2

Department felt that it was in violation of constitutional

3

rights, couldn't that have been corrected short of the federal

4

courts?

5

MR.

DAYS:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

we try to accom­

6

plish that on a daily basis.

It's not always possible and

7

in any event, as this Court well knows, Congress has acknow­

8

ledged how difficult it is for an agency to cut off funds to

9

people who are in need of assistance.

In many instances the

10

preferable

approach would be to go tc court to try to estab­

1 1

lish the rights and get specific performance, if you will, as

12

opposed to going through a process that would cut off the

13

funds.
Ir any event, under this particular legislative

14

15

ariangement, even if the; funds had been cut off under the DD

16

Act, Medicaid funds and other funds would continue to flow.

17
18

What we. think the DD Act represents is a compromise between
the Senate and House versions.
The Senate wanted to cut off all federal funds if

19

20
21

22
23
24

there were not compliance with the 400 pages of detailed stan­
dards.

The House did not want to do that.

The compromise is,

cut off funds that flow to the recipient under the DD Act.
If there are other funds flowing, it does not indicate that the:
Secretary can cut off those funds, but it does provide the
firedicate for a person who believes that he or she is being

25

64

1

harmed by a particular situation to go into court and get re­

2

lief.

And that is the nature of the compromise.

3

QUESTION:

4

were also interested in enforcing the Act of Congress in that

area?

The counsel for the

Nothing could be further from the truth, if one

looks at the record.

The Senate was really trying to estab­

lish rights that would be recognized in the handling of
federal

funds.

It has said so in many instances $ it said so

in the introductory provision, general findings; then it got
to specific findings of the rights.

There is certainly nothing definitive.

that the agency has spent its time encouraging through its
regulations and dealing more with what the Court of Appeals

23
24

referred to as presumptions against, institutionalization, and
the need to move people out of these institutions as quickly

25

67

1

as possible.
QUESTION:

General Days, what is your response to

3

the argument that if this is just an exercise of the spending

4

power, the amount of money appropriated by the fedetral govern­

5

ment is wholly Inadequate to achieve the purposes that your

6

construction of the statute would require?

7

MR. DAYS:

My response, once again, goes back to the

8

legislative history, that Congress on several occasions

9

referred to the ne:ed to use DD funds to leverage the use of

10

other federal and state monies to provide assistance to the

11

developmentally disabled.

12

terms of the entire pot of federal money going to assist devel­

13

opmentally disabled people. And I think there are references ir

14

the briefs of, the brief of PARC and of Halderman, to the

15

fact that there are some $3 billion being spent by the Federal

16

Government to assist states in meeting the needs of the

17

developmentally disabled.

QUESTION:

So Congress was rea]ly thinking in

Don't you think that part of the estab­

lished validity of the conditional spending power assumes that
there shall be a knowing acceptance of the conditions on the
part of the state, rather than a hidden, the acceptance that
thdy only learn about afterwards.
MR. DAYS:

Certainly it's preferable for Congress --

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think that the whole

validity of the concept depends upon that?
68

1

2

MR.

DAYS:

depends upon that.

3

QUESTION:

I don’t think that the whole validity
I think that the states were not -The spending power is based upon the pro­

4

position that a state is free to accept or to reject the offer’

5

of federal funds, conditioned upon meeting certain require­

6

ments.

7

the conditions are?

8

MR. DAYS:

9

And doesn't freedom of choice imply knowledge of what

I think what Congress has said in 6010

is not that the states are going to have their other federal

10

funds terminated under the DD Act; that's perhaps another law­

11

suit.

12

flowing to the state, then individua]s who are in those insti­

13

tutions may have a right to bring suit against you, recipient

14

of those other federal funds.

15
16

17

What Congress said was, insofar as those funds are

So, in terms of the administrative process, I don't
think there's any surprise associated with the DD Act.
QUESTION:

Well, Pennsylvania seems to be quite sur­

18

prised in this lawsuit.

19

MR.

20
21

22
23
24

DAYS:

Well, perhaps I should say, no reasonable

surprise associated with that arrangement, particularly during
this long relationship between the Congress and the states in
terms of effort to assist the developmentally disabled.

This

is not a statute that came out of the Congress like a
phoenix from the ashes.

It's part of a continuum of relation­

ship between states that have received
25

69

billions of

dollars

1

over the years from the federal government.

2

I don't think that the Congress has in any way abused or vio­

3

lated its spending power.

5

long period of time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS K. GILHOOL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT PENNSYLVANIA
ASSOCIATION FOR RETARDED CITIZENS
MR. GILHOOL:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may' it

please the Court:
This is a case of statutory construction at each

13

point dispositive of the issues here.

14

ied over 12 years, from 1963, and then intensively over four

15

legislative years, 1972 tc 1975, came to certain conclusions

16

about the situation of severely retarded people, about their

17

human possibilities, about the necessary conditions for real­

18

izing those possibilities, and about the persistent destruc­

19

20
21

22
23

24

25

The Congress having stud­

tion large isolated institutions impose.' upon retarded people.
6010 is both a deinstitutionalization sta.tute and
an anti-dumping statute.

What is required in the statutory

language are residential programs designed to maximize
developmental potential and in the least restrictive setting.
The states must move severely retarded people out of
large isolated institutions and, more, they must provide
70

1

structured habilitative residential programs in their stead.

2

The Congress did not leave the states naked in the

3

face of this duty.

4

verted, was aware, and indeed legislated with particular

5

awareness that there were, massive amounts of federal funds

6

being spent upon residential facilities and for retardation

7

services, and they legislated to redirect those funds as wel]

8

as the state funds being so spent to community care.

The Congress, as my colleagues have ad­

Mr. Justice Powell, Justice Stewart, the Congress

9

10

used the phrase, "public funds," in 6010.

Congress has used that phrase, rather than "federal financial

It comes, Justice White, perhaps more easily to my

lips than to General Pays', to point out that the Congress was

impatience with the federal executive's actions with respect

19

to these institutions.

QUESTION:

But doesn't Congress have budgetary con­

MR. GILHOOL:

and 6010 in the four years immediately before its development
came significantly from what the
71

Congress had learned in the

1

course of exercising that budgetary oversight.

in introducing the bill, and his statement pervades the legis­

for example,;and here, I suggest, also reached to state funds
which are not matching funds but which are invoked for similar
purposes to those that the federal-state funds would be invoked
for.

raised the single question asked in O'Connor v.

The observation --- and I quote -- was, "States have

5

6

said,

7

to give them the best custodial care we can,

8

and civilized care, but they're untreatable and we're just

9

going to keep them in an institution indefinitely.'"

10

I continue with the observation:

'We're going to institutionalize these people in order

"Presumptively,

duration, and the ideal was to provide decent custodial care

14

to relieve the families of the economic, social, and psycho­

I close the quotation with the observation:

In January, 1975.

It was sometime during the year 1975 that

MR. GILH00L:

No, sir; oh, no, sir.

For many long

7

decades, as the Congress found, the technology had been such

8

that retarded people, severely retarded people in particular,

9

were known to have the capability to learn and grow and

10

develop in the presence of the proper education and training

11

technology.

12

The Congress found that fact as a predicate for1 acting in

13

6010, as in the related statutes of the early 1970s.

14

It was not a. new fact; it wa.s quite an old one.

The situation, therefore, as the congressional judg­

15

ment again indicates, is that the choice is no longer ware­

16

housing on the one hand, of severely retarded people, or on

17

the other, imposing damage upon families.

18

choice, which affirms the humanity and citizenship of retarded

19

people, and it is the choice which the Congress required the

20

states to make in Section 6010, namely:

21

tating residential programs.

25

There is a third

The Congress prohibited custodial care, and required
developmental services.

That is plainly the case on the face

of 6010, and the Senate report accompanying the bill of rights
said, expressly, custodial care, which is predicated on the
74

1

assumption that certain individuals are essentially incapable

2

and "must: be rejected."

3

Now, with this prohibition of custodial care, of

4

Wcirehousing, and the requirement of babilitation, large iso­

5

lated institutions lost any reason they might have had for

being, let alone; the invidious reasons which prompted their

large isolated state institutions for the retarded had been

GILHOOL:

Your Honor, Mr. Justice Blackmun's

concurring opinion in Usery may have spoken to the question.
Of course, there is a point, both in terms of the magnitude of
the federal

funds made available under the spending power, and

in terms of the relationship between the purpose the Congress

undertakes, and the purposes for which those funds were appro­

the statute.

MR. GILH00L:

One remedial alternative for the dis­

are well in excess of $150 million in Pennsylvania.
QUESTION:

I understood you to say that 6010(3)
76

authorized the federal courts to cut off those federal and
state funds.

3

MR.

Did I misunderstand you?
GILH00L:

No, Your Honor, on the contrary.

4

And, forgive me, but the question you are raising, I take it,

goes to whether, as petitioners assert, without really a very

is not required to reach that question.

I think Congress was much more

Two critical points:

nowhere in the legislative

history or in the*. Act is there empower of federal court to
make individualized determinations and nowhere does it require
a legal presumption of deinstitutionalization.

To the extent

that Pennhurst is deficient -- and every institution, of
course, will have deficiencies; I think we live in the real
world -- Pennhurst should be improved.
But I think a very telling point has been omitted
by my colleagues.

They have a philosophy.

I represent the*,

parents, virtually all the parents and the: guardians of people
ait the facilities who are strongly opposed to deinstitutional­

23
24

ization for the very severely and profoundly retarded people.
QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, you say "virtually all."

25

84

1

Are there some that you do not represent?

2

MR. KLEIN:

There are some parents who are not mem­

3

bers of the organization, Your Honor; yes, that’s correct.

4

The organization has most of the parents.

5

the named plaintiff in the case withdrew from this case pre­

6

cisely because she opposed the philosophy.

One small point:

But the key point is that these parents, despite

7

8

the shortcomings of Pennhurst -- and Lord knows, they'd like

9

to see them improved -- they want to have their children

10

remain there, their adult children even.

1 1

are being put through, under this statute, lengthy hearings

12

to defend their philosophy.

13

Congress has the power to force them to do that.
QUESTION:

14

And these people

I suggest there is no way that
Thank you.

Mr. Klein, could I just ask you --

15

I should have asked General Days.

16

the Federal Government to intervene in this case, do you

17

know?

Is it provided for in the Act?
MR. KLEIN:

18

21

22

25

That issue -- no, that issue was raised.

In fact, the court declined to grant certiorari on the issue.
The United States Courts of Appeals were split at the time
over the standing of the United States to participate -- United
States v. Solomon, United States v. Mattson -~ had rejected it.
The 3rd Circuit upheld it as a general enforcement

23
24

Whait is the authority for

provision.

To some degree, on a going forward basis, Your

Honor, the issue is moot because Congress has passed a statute
85

1

authorizing the United States in the future, to participate.

2

And the issue was raised by the State of Pennsylvania in its

3

petition for certiorari in this Court's finding.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KLEIN:

Is that a general statute?
That is a general statute.

It's called

6

something like, "The All-Institutions Act," something like

7

that, passed in 1980, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted..)
