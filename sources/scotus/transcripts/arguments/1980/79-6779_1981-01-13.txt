ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON C.

ON BEHALF OF THE
MR . BLUE:

We ' ll hear arguments next

ESQ . ,

Mr. Chief Justice , and may it please the

Court :
From time to time in the history of our co un try
innovations have played a decisive role in the

11
12

formation of constitutional doctrine .

13

case in which an indigent defendant was de nied access to a

14

blood grouping test that conclusively exonerates more than 90

15

percent of all falsely accused putative fathers.

16

This is a paternity

A Connecticut statute categorically restricts access

17

to this test to those defendants able to purchase it in ad-

18

vance of trial .

QIJESTION :

In your statement of facts -- and I was

troubled in reading the brief too -- I thought in a negative
way, if it exonerated putative fathers, it e xonerated them
100 percent .
MR . BLUE :

It exonerates 90 percent of innocent

putative fathers 100 percent of the time .
25

·rn other words,

if you have 100 accused putative fathers , none of whom are the
3

actual fathers .

The blood test, standard blood test available

2

everywhere , will conclusivelv show that 91 or 93, depending

3

on the race, of those men are not the father .

4

seven to nine percent, the test will simply be inconclusive .
QUESTION:

5

Well, I had thought that

With the other

--

maybe the

technology has gone beyond my previous knowledge -- but I had

thought that if you showed that the putative , the accused

father had blood of a type different from the

MR . BLUE :

The capability

of medical science is simply that it will prove that exclusion
to appro x imately 91 or 93 percent .

No , it is not . It is approximately 91 to

93 percent, but with those innocent defendants , there is no

8

QUESTION:

And you can't cross - examine a blood test .

9

MR . BLUE:

Well, that ' s correct; that's correct .

10

And it's quite a different proposition than an alibi witness

11

which raises problems of credibility in virtually any case .

12

QUESTION:

You can cross - examine the people who

13

make the test, can ' t you, and isn ' t there often cross-examina-

MR . BLUE:

Well, that is correct , because this is

quite a different type of evidence than ordinary expert wit ness testimony that we're inclined to think of in, for example
criminal cases;

in, for example, a criminal case where you

have psychiatric testimony indicating that the defendant is
or is not sane .

You will have a situation in which different

experts might hold honestly, might honestly hold different
beliefs and have different observations of the same phenomena .
This is not the case with blood test evidence where there is a
showing of exclusion; there will be no doubt as to the fact

25

that the man is in fact excluded , and you simply do not have
5

the type of disagreement between expert witnesses that you
2

would, for example, in a criminal case involving

3

testimony .

4

even in the universe of expert testimony .

It is really quite a distinct type of evidence

Now, it's our position that these distinctions which
I have drawn make the constitutional difference, and the difference goes to both the truth- seeking function of the Court,
or of the factfinder, whichever that may be, and also because
the inevitable result of the distinction or the discrimination
that Connecticut has chosen to draw is a dual system of justic
I recall, in the case of United States v . Raddatz

out that the focus of the Due Process Clause is a

concern for accurate results, and surely few cases can be
imagined in which that practical concern has a greater impact

Isn ' t there another answer?

If the wit -

ness is within the jurisdiction and subject to process , if

10

he ' s a $289 e xpert, the defendant has a right to subpoena him,

15

Well, who pays his fee?

In these cases,

16

surely, how the test was done by the laboratory that did it

17

and by whom it was done, which has to be an expert in this

18

field , that ' s always open to inquiry .

19

25

MR . BLUE:

That's correct .

QUESTION:

Who pays the expense, even if he may be

subpoenaed , of the expert witness who testifies in that
respect?

Who pays that?
MR . BLUE :

The question rarely arises because when

there is a medical showing of e xclusion , typically the defendant will typically withdraw the case , or it would often be a

QUESTION:

And the State would say, well, we're not

so sure that laboratory does these things in the way they
ought to be done, and if you ' re going to do that, you'd better
be prepared to put on expert testimony to support the validity
of the test and the method by which it was taken .

QUESTION:

But if it's thel

Yes, but doesn't your argument really

carry over to the other situation?
MR. BLUE:

What do you mean by the other situation,

Justice Blackmun?
QUESTION:

Well , take a purely private paternity

13

action, and if the blood test is so crucial and so conclusive,

14

on your theory if the putative father is indigent, shouldn ' t

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

n
23

the State pay for that also?
MR . BLUE:

In due process terms I think it makes a

great deal of difference whether the plaintiff, the actual
plaintiff is the State or a purely private person .

Because

I think that the Fourteenth Amendment, as Justice Rehnquist
pointed out in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Company, draws
a sharp distinction between deprivations by the State and
deprivations by private people, no matter how wrongful,
against which the Fourteenth Amendment offers no appeal .
In terms of equal protection, it may well not be evident who

25

is the plaintiff .

The same disparity of treatment would exist
15

between indigent defendants and nonindigent defendants .

But

2

the State is the plaintiff in this case and the only line

3

that I am urging the Court to draw certainly in terms of due

•

process is a line that involves the fact that the real force,

s

the real moving party in interest here was the State of

6

Connecticut .
QUESTION :

7

s

Well, you ' re taking the Boddie approach,

Boddie v . Connecticut.
MR . BLUE :

9

That ' s what you really rely on .
That is in large part correct, because

10

the fact of the matter is that like the would- be plaintiffs

11

in Boddie, who were

12

tive to the judicial process for the defendant in this case .

13

And I s up pose , unlike Boddie, he may not be -- Mr. Little may

in which this Court held that the standard for performance of

QUESTION :

Yes .

Well, wouldn ' t that apply here too,

whether it's a private plaintiff or the State is a plaintiff?
The resulting judgment is the judgment of a state court saying
that Defendant D is the father of the plaintiff?
MR . BLUE :

Mr . Justice Rehnquist , that is a legiti-

mate argument , and the Court might well rightfully hold that
the same result should pertain to all defendants, whether or
not they're prosecuted by the State .

But I want to point out

that the fact remains that the real plaintiff here, throwing

of indigency walking into a hospital and asking for a blood

taxed against a state or against the private plaintiff, if it

12

were to go that far, if the blood grouping tests prove to the

MR. McGOVERN:

Your Honor, for the taxing of cost .

The paternity statute

itself, under which judgment is entered, provides that the
cost of support and maintenance of the minor child, attorneys'
fees, sheriff's fees, may be

as cost .

There is no pro-

vision under the statute that the cost of the blood grouping
test be paid and I have never seen a case in which a defendant
prevailed in the State of Connecticut in which costs were
taxed against the State .
