MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Duck, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We will hear arguments

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is before you on a writ of certiorari to

10

the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

11

The grant of certiorari is limited only to the issue respect­

12

ing communications.

13

district court can enter a monitoring order recommended by the

14

Manual when potential abuses of the class action device have

15

actually taken place.

16

The issue in the case is whether the

The 5th Circuit held that such an order could not be

17

entered, that it was a prior restraint, and therefore uncon­

18

stitutional.

19

briefly state our position.

20

23 the district court has a unique responsibility to monitor

21

the actions of the parties before it, to protect the interests

22

of absentees, to insure compliance with that fiduciary obliga­

23

tion that attorneys have to the courts in the administration

24

of justice.

25

district c’ourt properly exercised its discretion under Rule 2 3

Before getting into the facts, I would like to

ner .
QUESTION:

4

5

Mr. Duck, is the actual order that was

entered in the record here somewhere?

6

MR. DUCK:

It is, Your Honor, it's on page 124 of

7

the Joint Appendix.

8

QUESTION:

Thank you.

9

MR. DUCK:

The facts in this case are very simple.

10

The action was commenced on May 18, 1976, as a class action.

11

The plaintiffs sought to represent a group of employees, pre­

12

sent and former employees, at the employer's Port Arthur

13

refinery.

14

cants for employment nationwide, without restriction as to gec-

15

graphic location.

16

case, are being represented by three members associated with

17

the Legal Defense Fund, and two private attorneys,

18

Miss Morrison and Mr. Cotton.

19

They also sought to represent a group of appli­

The applicants, the plaintiffs in this

Now, one month prior to the commencement of this

20

action, the employer in this case entered into a conciliation

21

agreement with the EEOC and the 0E0.

22

vided for back pay awards to about 616 employees at the plant

23

It's important for the Court to know that the group of indi­

24

viduals who were going to receive conciliation benefits

25

was much smaller than plaintiffs' proposed class.
4

And that agreement pro­

1

At the time the employer was served with the com­

2

plaint, already 430 of the 616 individuals entitled to

3

conciliation benefits had received those benefits, so there

4

was only about 180 people left to sign up.

5

At the time the employer was served it voluntarily

6

suspended contact with all potential class members and the

7

reason for this is because under Rule 23(e) the employer felt

8

that by settlement it might be interpreted to be approved by

9

the court, and the employer wanted to wait until the action

10

got before the court and the court could get control of the

1 1

litigation.

12

Now, four days after suit, just four days after

13

suit, a meeting was called by respondents and attended by

14

three of their attorneys.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

When you say "after suit," do you mean

after the filing of the complaint?
MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that's right; and

18

prior to the time that Gulf was served.

It was attended by

19

three attorneys:

20

ciated with the Legal Defense Fund; and two private attorneys

21

Miss Morrison, and Mr. Cotton.

22

from affidavits of opposing counsel that are. in the Appendix

23

on page 111, 114, and 117, it was shown that they discussed

24

the issues in this lawsuit, they discussed the conciliation

25

agreement, and they talked about the hazards of fair

one attorney, Mr. Thibodeaux, who is asso­

In that meeting, as we see

5

1

employment litigation.

2

Now, it was disclosed to Gulf by an attendee at the

3

meeting, and Gulf so reported to the court in its brief, that

4

the attorneys also stated to the group not to sign the con­

5

ciliation agreement, if they had received checks from the

6

employer to send them back, because they could recover double

7

the amount in this by prosecuting this lawsuit.

8

in time the employer was put in a very difficult position.

9

It sought an interim order --

10

QUESTION:

At that point

Mr. Duck, let me just be sure I under­

11

stand, did the affidavits represent that they could recover

12

twice as much in the litigation?

13

MR. DUCK:

No, it didn't, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Where does that show up in the record

MR. DUCK:

That shows up in our brief to the court

15

then?

16
17

where we represented to the court that that had taken place.

18
19

QUESTION:

And what was the source of that represen­

MR. DUCK:

Your Honor, this is outside the record,

tation?

20
21

but one of the attendees, one of the black attendees at the

22

meeting, voluntarily came forward and reported what took place

23

to the employer.

Your Honor, we submit for purposes

6

it was part of the record, it was in the brief, it was a

7

representation by counsel.

8
9

QUESTION:

But a representation you were unable to

substantiate?

10

MR. DUCK:

Your Honor, it's our position in this

1 1

case that the district court must be able to look at every­

12

thing that's before him when trying to decide whether to enter

13

such a monitoring order.

QUESTION:

If you rely on a fact that isn't estab­

lished as a fact, maybe there's a possibility that that might

18

happen, but you can't really say that the record demonstrates

19

that it did happen.

20

MR. DUCK:

Your Honor, it's really not our position.

21

We are not here advocating -- although we believe it happened

22

-- we're not advocating that the district court should resolve

23

that conflict.

24

situation that the district court looked at at that point in

25

time gave him sufficient discretion to enter this order.

We're simply saying that the totality of the

QUESTION:

1

2

Do you regard that as an essential part

of what he would need in order to enter such an order?

3

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice Stevens --

4

QUESTION:

Shall we assume it happened or not

5

happened for the purpose of deciding the case?
MR. DUCK:

6

I don't think it's essential for this

7

Court to resolve the conflict either.

8

that the facts -QUESTION: It seems to me you should not be relying

9
10

In other words, I thinl

on it here,
MR. DUCK:

11

We submit, Your Honor, that it in fact

12

did happen, that the district court could in fact take that

13

into consideration.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but you can't submit as a fact

15

something and say we don't have to decide whether it's a fact

16

or not?

17

MR. DUCK:

Yes, sir.

I would like to submit,

18

Justice Stevens, that here we had a situation that the district

19

court was looking at the fact that the meeting took place,

20

the fact that the affidavit stated certain representations

21

or comments were made to the potential class members in

22

attendance.

23

making very basic decisions about their rights, whether to

24

sign up in a conciliation agreement or whether to join in

25

this lawsuit.

At that time these potential class members were

And we think those factors weigh just as
8

1

heavily as the conflict that exists between counsel as far

2

as what the district court had to do and the action he had to

3

take.
QUESTION:

4

It seems to me there's

quite a differ­

5

ence between a lawyer saying that the claim that would be

6

filed would be for an amount twice as much as the settlement

7

or something like that, which presumably might be an accurate

8

description of the claim, and a statement by the lawyer that

9

if we file such a claim we guarantee that you will recover

10

twice as much.

And you're suggesting that they said the

11

latter rather than the former?

12

MR. DUCK:

That's true, Your Honor.

We do --

13

QUESTION:

It's very possible that a person attend­

14

ing the meeting reporting it might not have the distinction

15

between those two kinds of statements very clearly in mind.
MR. DUCK:

16

Your Honor, it's not our position that

17

any misrepresentation actually took place.

18

possible to know if it was a misrepresentation until the law­

19

suit was tried and a final verdict was entered, whether it

20

was -QUESTION:

21

It would be im­

Well, shall we decide the case on the

22

assumption that there were no misrepresentations at that

23

meeting?

24
25

MR. DUCK:

No, Your Honor, as I again urge the

Court, to look at the entire circumstances
9

that were before

1

the district court, I submit to the Court that it's not -QUESTION:

2

You're saying that some things outside

3

the record should be treated as though they were before the

4

district court.
MR. DUCK:

5

Mr. Justice Stevens, I submit to the

6

Court that the district courts

7

under the federal rules, decide matters that are before them

8

but may be not technically in the record all the time:

9

motions to compel, discovery orders, all these types of

10

acting in their discretion,

matters.
QUESTION:

11

What kind of an affidavit would be suf­

12

ficient in connection with -- would an information and belief

13

affidavit be all right, or not?
MR. DUCK:

14
15

ments that the employer represented to the court?
QUESTION:

16
17

Mr. Justice White, to support the state­

Yes.

If an affidavit that the employer

had been informed by so-and-so; this is hearsay?
MR. DUCK:

18

Mr. Justice White, I think that that

19

would again be appropriate for the district court to consider

20

as far as what action he's going to take based upon his dis­

21

cretion .

22
23
24
25

QUESTION: But that kind of an affidavit wasn't
presented, was it?
MR. DUCK:

That's true, indeed, Your Honor.

VJe do

submit that this case shouldn't turn on exactly what was said
10

1

or resolved in the differences between counsel in this case,

2

but look at the total circumstances before the district

3

court, the unique position that he was in when he saw the

4

meeting that took place, when he saw the conflict between

5

counsel -QUESTION:

6

Of course that -- even if you're fight

7

that might not justify the order that was entered; or that

8

if, and even if you're wrong and we -- doesn't mean that the

9

order was bad.

Suppose we won't take your -- suppose we

10

judge the case without this claim of misrepresentation, you

11

don't say you've lost the case?
MR. DUCK:

12

Mr. Justice White, we certainly do not.

13

And the reason for that is, consider the type of order that

14

was entered here.

15

munication. This order simply monitored what took place in

16

that class action setting.

17

because the order specifically exempted a number of types of

18

communication.

This was not an entered,

QUESTION:

19

suppressed com­

It didn't say you couldn't speak,

Suppose in this case that counsel had

20

thought that something he wanted to send out was constitu­

21

tionally protected and he then sent it out.

22

that the order supposedly required that he summarize it, at

23

least, and notify the court that he had sent it out.

24

he

25

held that that counsel's constitutional rights had been

that.

And then he knew

Suppose

Would the court of appeals have then

11

1

violated?

2

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice White, it’s our position --

3

QUESTION:

I know, but what did the court of appeals

4

hold?

5

it required reporting to the court a communication that

6

counsel sent out because they thought it was constitutionally

7

protected?
MR. DUCK:

8
9

Did it also invalidate the order to the extent that

Mr. Justice White, apparently it did;

it invalidated the entire order.

It held that the entire

10

order, and they looked at it, was a prior restraint of First

1 1

Amendment freedoms,

12

QUESTION:

and was unconstitutional.
But there was a provision per

that

13

counsel would not have been in contempt if he had thought,

14

any statement he thought protected, if he sent it out, he

15

would have been in contempt if he hadn't reported it after­

16

wards?
MR. DUCK:

17

That's true, Mr. Justice White.

20

members, his only thing he had to do was report it five days

later.

The rule, actually, was that that he

asserted was constitutionally protected, not that it was in

MR. DUCK:

2

Exactly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that he

3

asserted it.

4

is our position that very free communications can take place.

5

If it was -- now, it might come to mind immediately, well, whac

of the order was to monitor and detect, it wasn't to suppress.

Do you think the 5th Circuit held that

that kind of an order would be a prior restraint?

I think they did, Your Honor, in this

case.

They held that this was a prior restraint of

Are you saying, are you suggesting that

there aren't any constitutionally protected communications in

5

thought there might be.
MR. DUCK:

6

The district court apparently

Mr. Justice White, it's our position that

7

when you have to resolve the right of the district court to

8

administer his proceeding, that the constitutional rights of

9

parties and of their attorneys become lesser, they must bow

10

to that kind -- it's like Cox v. Louisiana, which extended

1 1

that right even outside the courtroom, where you said picket­

12

ing could be limited outside the courtroom, just like the

13

Supreme Court's own Rule 7, which says that clerks cannot

14

discuss matters that are pending before the Court even after

15

they've left the Court.
QUESTION:

16

In the G.eders

case, though, we did say

17

that there was at least in the federal system a right of a

18

client to discuss a matter with his attorney.
MR. DUCK:

19

That's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and

20

this order specifically allowed the attorney to consult his

21

client.

22

the attorney If the potential class member wanted to.

23

It really restricted him, what it really looked at, was the

24

ex parte attempt by an attorney to contact the potential class

25

member.

It even allowed potential class members to consult

tected; all they had to do was report it to the court five

3

days later.
We submit that because of this, it's inappropriate

4
5

It was constitutionally pro­

to apply labels to this situation.
QUESTION:

6

When you say, if they had asked to do

so, as I have read the order, they didn't even have to ask

8

to do so.

9

done it.

10

They simply had to report that they had in fact

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you're correct;

1 1

that is, all they had to do was assert the right.

12

no prior approval of the court.

13

later.

14

There was

You do it and then report it

That's exactly right.
QUESTION:

You would concede, I take it, that any

15

time a rule of a court even dealing with activities of a

16

lawyer in litigation imposes a prior restraint, that it's

17

something that gets very careful examination by the courts?

18

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, no, our position is

19

that especially during ongoing litigation the court must be

20

able to exercise control over the parties and over the’ counsel

21

As Mr. Justice Brennan said in Nebraska Press, counsel have

22

the fiduciary obligation not to make communications that

23

redound to the detriment of the accused and which supports

24

the administration of justice.

25

it's particularly inappropriate to look at this as a prior

And that's why we think that

15

1

restraint case.

It's a balancing case, and the interest

2

to be balanced, the court's rights to administer that case,

3

a unique class action case.

4

parties are before the court, it's not a 23(b)(3) case where

5

you opt in or opt out.

6

those potential class members are right before the court.
QUESTION:

7

It's a case where all of the

This is a 23(b)(2) case where all

Could I ask you this question?

This

8

order runs both against the parties and their counsel as I

9

understand it?

10

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice Stevens, that's correct.

11

QUESTION:

Do you think the same standards apply

12

to the court's power to monitor communications between

13

counsel and potential class members, as would apply to com­

14

munications between class members and, say, a friend or a

15

relative who was interested in perhaps joining the class?
MR. DUCK:

16
17

Mr. Justice Stevens, I'm sorry, I don't

quite understand your question.

18

QUESTION:

Well, you pointed out that the lawyer

19

has a special fiduciary obligation both to the court and his

20

clients and therefore that may justify greater monitoring of

21

the lawyer's communications to potential clients or his

22

client.

23

purposes of analysis in this case to potential communications

24

between a member of the class who Is a layman and some one

25

he may know who is a potential person who might be persuaded

My question is, do you apply the same standard for

16

1

2

to join the class or join the litigation?
MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't think the

3

same standard would apply in this case.

4

to both counsel and the parties.

The order did apply

5

QUESTION:

Right.

6

MR. DUCK:

This was pre-class certification, so

7

8
9
10

there were no class members.
QUESTION:

The only --

No, but there were parties, there were

multiple parties.
MR. DUCK:

There were six parties; yes, sir. So it

1 1

applied to the six parties and to counsel, but didn't apply

12

to anyone else.

13
14

15

QUESTION:

I'm asking, does the same standard apply

to those six parties as applies to their lawyers?
MR. DUCK:

It does indeed, Your Honor, and the rea­

16

son for that is because those parties are before the court anc

17

they could be used indirectly to accomplish what the court was

18

trying to prevent directly.

19

QUESTION:

Why isn't it a prior restraint?

What is

2

the source of the court -- just because a person has become a

3

party to litigation, he gives up some First Amendment rights

4

he would otherwise have, you say?

5

MR. DUCK:

Your Honor, in this case --

6

QUESTION:

If he wants to discuss the issues in the

7

case, give a speech, whatever it might be, he can’t do that?

9

MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice Stevens, we don't suggest

that the parties or counsel check their constitutional rights

at the courthouse door.

order points out,that still freeflowing communications were

12

allowed.

13

What we're suggesting here, and this

QUESTION:

I understand, but anytime a person did gi ve

a speech or talk to a friend about the lawsuit

15

he had to summarize that and tell the court about it within

16

five days?

17

MR. DUCK:

something,

Yes, that's true, Mr. Justice Stevens.

We contend that that is not an overbroad statement, because

QUESTION:

I think

Well, would this order bar a communica­

putting out a circular to all potential class members includ­

not to take the settlement?
MR. DUCK:

Mr. Justice White, such a circular could

have been distributed under this order if they had claimed

the constitutional right to do so.
QUESTION:

7

I know; that isn't my question.

Unless

they did report it to the court, that kind of a communication

Moreover, the trial court made no finding that

plaintiffs' counsel had engaged in any misrepresentation or

13

any abuse and indeed, on this record, it could not have made

any such finding.

Mr. Greenberg, you don't contend -- or

16

do you? -- that a finding of misrepresentation or abuse of

MR. GREENBERG:

We do contend that an order limiting

you're saying doesn't add up to the proposition that the

that they must let the court know what communications are

going on?

18

MR. GREENBERG:

19

QUESTION:

20

21

22
23

That is indeed our position; yes.

Then the rule itself is a violation of

the First Amendment, in your view of the case?
MR. GREENBERG:

Our position is that the rule

suggested by the Manual violates the First Amendment; yes.
QUESTION:

Suppose the rule suggested by the Manual

24

was based on some kind of experience by the members of the

25

group that fashioned the rule in the Manual, that there had
31

1

been these kinds of abuses in case after case after case, and

2

therefore the time had come when we felt it necessary in the

3

interests of the administration of justice to have a prophy­

4

lactic 'rule?

Suppose we had something like that?

MR. GREENBERG:

5

Well, first I would like to say

6

that the Manual itself expressly says that the kinds of

7

abuses they're dealing with are rare, and do not occur with

8

any frequency and that is in the Manual itself as a predicate

9

to the rule.

11

you think it's important to remember that when this Manual

was being set up this was at the beginning of the class actior

13

and the frequency or rarity of these occurrences would be

14

something largely guesswork except as to the events beginning

15

with Rule 23, or the use of Rule 23.
MR. GREENBERG:

16

Isn't that correct?

Well, yes, the answer is yes

;

17

and no.

18

as we know it in 1970, but when I went to law school in 1949

19

we still had Rule 23; It was in a rather different form and

20

the same considerations applied.

It was coterminous with the adoption of Rule 23

QUESTION:

And the potentialities of Rule 23 were

not immediately recognized by the profession, is that not so?
MR. GREENBERG:

Oh, no.

I mean, I -- well, all I

24

know is that I was in scores of class action cases and saw

25

many other hundreds of lawyers doing the same thing.
33

1

Class actions have been a commonplace under the federal rules

7

But, returning to pervasive abuse, let's say all

8

lawyers were acting like Mrs. Ohralik, in Ohralik v. Ohio,

9

one perhaps might then think it was necessary to have a pro­

10

phylactic rule, but in that instance it should be precise, it

11

should be focused at the abuse, it should, unless the viola­

12

tion were epidemic, be based upon a hearing that some abuse

13

of this sort had occurred, and it should not be a prior

14

restraint unless absolutely necessary but be corrective or

15

perhaps punitive, and prior, if that's the only way of

16

dealing with it.

MR. GREENBERG:

Well, you've addressed it.
We would like to and I believe I've

23

done this in court, call attention to the sweeping, vague,

24

and onerous nature of the order prohibiting communication.

25

It was full of language like "including but not limited to

court for consideration."

13

In accordance with what we have said on the clear

14

and present danger cases, neither "inherent tendency" nor

15

"reasonable tendency" is enough to justify a restriction of

16

free expression.

And so, this is the kind of language and

QUESTION:

Mr. Greenberg, your time is running. Are

you going to get to the significance of the exception?
MR. GREENBERG:

Yes, or -- there were two excep­

21

tions: one is you might apply for permission to communicate ir

22

advance; and the other is, you might communicate if you had

23

a constitutional belief that you could not be restrained in

24

prior fashion and then you'd have to within five days file it

25

with the court.
36

1

As to applying in advance, as to the parties, I

2

think it's simple.

I don't think a layman, a worker at the

3

plant, would know how to apply.

4

It would become an absolutely impossibly cumbersome method

5

of dealing with it.

in the ordinary course of preparing a case interviews, sifts,

whom you're interviewing in this kind of case is, one, is how

much do you think I'm going to get; and two is, what do you

think of the judge?

As to the first question, it's --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES ET AL. AS AMICI CURIAE
38

There's

MR. WALLACE:

1

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
What Mr. Greenberg has just said supports our con­

3
4

tention that the order was an inappropriate one under Rule 23.

5

We agree with 21 of the 22 judges who sat on the en banc

6

court in that regard and we believe the judgment of the court

7

can and should be affirmed on this nonconstitutional ground.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

But we don't ordinarily take cases just

to decide whether it was a proper abuse of discretion, and
proper discretionary review by the court of appeals, do we?

1 1

MR. WALLACE:

No, Mr. Justice, but in this case

12

the constitutional issue on which the Court granted certiorari

13

is so closely interrelated with the question of what should

14

the courts appropriately order under Rule 23 that the same

15

guidance can be forthcoming from this Court without neces­

16

sarily basing that guidance on a constitutional holding.

17

That's our point.

18

much.

The guidance really wouldn't differ that

19

Class actions have played an important role in the

20

enforcement of federal civil rights laws and of other statu­

21

tory and constitutional rights and this Court has recognized

22

that they constitute a form of constitutionally protected

23

freedom of association and petitioning of the Government for

24

redress of grievances.

25

QUESTION:

And the Court --

We don't ordinarily think of -- or do you
39

1

suggest we should think of the suits brought in federal courts

2

as exercising the right of petition for grievances?
MR. WALLACE:

3

Well, I believe that underlies many

4

of this Court's decisions, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v.

5

Virginia and NAACP v. Button, and some of the others on the

6

development of class claims, that this is a form of peaceable

7

petition.

8

were advocating getting the assertion of civil rights out of

9

the streets and into the courts where grievances can be re­

10

Many of those arose at a time when many persons

dressed by the Government.

1 1

QUESTION:

So, as I understand it, Mr. Wallace,

12

unlike Mr. Greenberg, you would say that some form of class

13

action is constitutionally required?

14

MR. WALLACE:

I believe that's the implication of

15

those decisions of this Court, all of which have been based or

16

constitutional grounds and in particular, the Court has recog­

17

nized a substantial measure of constitutional protection for

18

communications involved In the development of the class

19

claims.

20

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't you sever it there and

21

say that the

22

24

MR. WALLACE:

protection

to

Well, I think what the Constitution

protects beyond the actual complaint stage differs.
40

I agree

1

with that.

That does create some change, but it seems to me

2

that the recognition most recently in the Primus case in this

3

Court of the constitutional protection for communications in­

4

volved in the development of the assertion of class claims

5

of this sort

6

not the case itself need be decided on constitutional grounds.

goes far toward deciding this case, whether or

Our basic point on this is that while Rule 23 does

7

8

prescribe certain safeguards against unfairness in the use of

9

class claims and authorizes the district courts to enter

10

orders that are appropriate for standing upon those prescribec

1 1

safeguards, the basic purpose of Rule 23 after all is to per­

12

mit the assertion of class claims and the maintenance of class

13

actions.

14

therefore, it must not unduly interfere with the assertion of

15

the class claims and the development of the class suit.

16

it must --

And for an order to be appropriate under the rule,

QUESTION:

17

So, do I understand correctly then that

18

you would assert that Sample Pretrial Order No. 15 of the

19

Manual Is contrary to Rule 23?
MR. WALLACE:

20

And

Well, that's the conclusion we have

21

come to.

It's also the conclusion that the 3rd Circuit has

22

come to in two cases cited by the court below, and it's the

23

conclusion that 21 of the judges below came to. I think the

24

3rd Circuit actually articulated this part of the argument

25

with greater relation to the purposes of Rule 23.
41

QUESTION:

1

Are you really saying that a preventive

2

or prophylactic rule inherently runs into the First Amendment

3

because it will reach some cases unnecessarily?
MR. WALLACE:

4

Well, we don't say there's no room

5

for prophylactic rules.

This one is too sweeping.

As we put

6

the argument, it unduly interferes with the assertion and

7

development of class claims, which is the basic purpose of

8

Rule 23.

class claims.

It's to enable persons to assert and develop their

tivity to the constitutional rights that have been recognized

in this Court's cases.

13

and of the proposal.

14

QUESTION:

That's the failing of the rule here

Mr. Wallace, under Rule 23, do you think

15

it would be appropriate for the judge simply to require that

16

counsel for both sides submit copies of all communications

17

with class members and potential class members?

18
19

20
21

22

MR. WALLACE:

Well, when you say "copies,"

Mr. Justice, that suggests written communications.
QUESTION:

Right.

I'm talking, not about any

prior restraint, but just copies after they have been sent.

It's difficult for us to take a posi­

QUESTION:

is applicable to what might be called a genuine prior

restraint such as in Nebraska Press?

18

Would you suggest, if we reach that

MR. WALLACE:

What's involved here is a form of

prior restraint.
QUESTION:

But it's limited and you might focus on

20

type of prior restraint.

by Justice Black for the Court in the United Transportation

I'm looking at page 581 of

14

specificity about an area of particular potential abuse un­

less an order has been formulated on the basis of findings

16

that abuse has occurred, which requires some remedial con­

17

straint, which is not the situation here.

It seems to me that the Court has been sound in

adopting that approach under the First Amendment.
