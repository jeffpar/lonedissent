PROCEEDINGS

2

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments first

3

this morning in Federal Communications Commission v. WNCN

4

Listeners and the related and consolidated cases.
Mr. Saylor, I think you may proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. SAYLOR, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF
THE PETITIONERS FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, ET AL.
MR. SAYLOR:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This is an important case for the nation's nearly

12

9,000 radio stations and their millions of avid listeners.

13

The decision here, will determine whether regulators in Washing­

14

ton over their own strong objections must intrude into the

15

workings of the radio entertainment marketplace in countless

16
17

18
19

20

21
22

communities across the country.
QUESTION:

You seem to emphasize radio.

Do you

think it has no bearing on broadcasting generally?
MR. SAYLOR:

I think the case does have bearing on

television as well, but the Commission's policy statement is
restricted to radio.

Therefore, I believe the issue before

the Court today strictly relates to radio.
The issue before this Court is this:

must the

23

Federal Communications Commission in ruling on radio license
24

renewals and transfers decide whether to permit a radio statior
25

3

1

to change from one type of entertainment programming to an­

2

other.

3

termine in the proceedings below that the Communications Act

4

of 1934, read in light of the First Amendment, grants the

5

Commission the discretion to decline to review changes in so-

6

called unique entertainment formats?

Or, stated a different way, did the FCC correctly de­

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

7

8

Circuit sitting en banc ruled against the Commission.

9

Court declared that the Commission must hold a hearing to de­

10

termine whether a format change is consistent with the public

1 1

interest.

12

QUESTION:

The

Mr. Saylor, what was not entirely clear

13

to me in reading the briefs is, are we talking about changes

14

that have been made or prospective changes, or both?

15

16

17
18
19

20

21
22
23

MR. SAYLOR:

Mr. Justice Stewart,.this case involves

proposed changes as well as changes that may have taken place
midterm in a three-year license period.
QUESTION:
MR. SAYLOR:

Both?
Yes.

However, according to a footnote

in the Court of Appeals decision, a

challenge to the midterm

change in format would not come until the time for renewal.
QUESTION:
MR. SAYLOR:
QUESTION:

Renewal or transfer.
Yes.
Would the standard be any different if we

24

were talking about the initial issuance of a license, if such
25

4

1

licenses were available?

2

is the public interest.
MR. SAYLOR:

3

All the statute says as I read it

That's correct.

It's the same standard,

4

public interest, convenience, and necessity.

The Commission's

5

view in this situation, both renewals and transfers, is that

6

it would not be in the public interest to engage in regulation

7

of unique formats.

8

when it's an initial licensing.

9

so-called specialized program issues in comparative cases

There's a somewhat different question posec
The Commission has considered

10

which would come up often at initial licensing time.

1 1

none of those cases has the Commission ever considered the en­

12

tertainment programming as such in deciding whether or not the

13

application should be granted.

14

did not address itself in this policy statement to the question

15

16

17

20
21

22

So that while the Commission

you raise, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe the Commission's
policy in the past has been not to consider entertainment pro­
gramming in making decisions regarding initial licensing.
QUESTION:

18
19

But in

issues.

I'm not sure how you relate that to the

Let me put another question to you.

Suppose on

renewal of a license at the expiration of three years the
representatives of the listening audience came in and demon­
strated that this station had changed its format and was show­
ing nothing except football games, basketball games, hockey

23

games, prizefights, and athletic events; nothing else.
24

that be relevant to the issue of renewal of the license?
25

5

Would

MR. SAYLOR:

1

The Commission would not, in my view,

2

consider the entertainment programming as such.

3

sion would, however, be concerned if the licensee or the appli­

4

cant indicated no interest in programming news and public af­

5

fairs, so-called non-entertainment programming.

6

has -QUESTION:

7

The Commis­

The Commission

So the format if -- I'm not sure exactly

8

what that term embraces in this case, but the content

9

programming is a very relevant factor in the renewal of a li­

10

cense, is it not?
MR. SAYLOR:

1 1

12
13
14

15

16

19

The Commission has considered the quan­

tity of non-entertainment programming proposed by an applicant,
but it has never delved into the quality of the programming
and has not made value judgments regarding whether one type of
entertainment programming is more in the public interest than
another.
QUESTION:

17

18

of

So the standard is the same for both the

issuance of the original license and for the renewal , is it
not ?
MR. SAYLOR:

Yes, it is.

20

QUESTION:

And does the Commission treat them dif­

21

ferently in the sense of evaluating entertainment versus news
22

and that sort of thing?
23

MR. SAYLOR:

No.

In neither instance does the Com­

24

mission consider the entertainment programming as such.
25

6

1

The non-entertainment programming such as news and public af­

2

fairs programming is considered but in a very general sense.

3

The Commission simply wants to assure itself that the appli­

4

cant will not neglect that type of programming.

5

inquires as to what percentage of the broadcast week, or the

6

broadcast day, will be devoted to news and other informational

7

programming.
QUESTION:

8
9

It's basically a quantitative considera­

tion?

10

MR. SAYLOR:

1 1

QUESTION:

12

The Commissior

It is a quantitative consideration
Plus, I suppose, objectivity and fairness

and so on?
MR. SAYLOR:

13

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

And the rea­

14

son for that is that the news and other informational program­

15

ming makes up a small, relatively small portion of the broad­

16

cast day,

17

consumes the balance of the broadcast day and it is there that

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

whereas the entertainment programming traditionally

the Commission has felt that the Congress wanted broadcasters
to compete.

And basically that's where they compete, with

their entertainment program.

Were the Commission to regulate

entertainment programming it would reduce the licensee

dis­

cretion in that very large portion of the broadcast day and
raise in the Commission's view serious First Amendment con­
siderations.
QUESTION:

Mr. Saylor, what about the percentage of
7

1

time for commercials?

2

MR. SAYLOR:

Is there any regulation of that?
The Commission has a guideline in the

3

form of a delegation of authority to the Staff of the Broad­

4

cast Bureau.

5

cast hour above a

6

the Commission would consider that and if there is not an ade­

7

quate explanation from the licensee, the Commission might well

8

put that matter into hearing to determine whether or not the

9

licensee is proposing an excessive amount of commercial pro­

10

If the applicant proposes a percentage of broad­
certain

number for commercial programming,

gramming.
QUESTION:

1 1

What is the justification for that other

12

than its possible impact on the entertainment part of the pro­

13

gramming .

14

MR.

SAYLOR:

Well, I guess historically the Congress

15

has expressed some interest in the amount of commercials on

16

broadcast programming and the Commission has felt that perhaps

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

some supervision is appropriate in order to insure that licen­
sees don’t vastly exceed what would be in the public interest.
However, the Commission is presently reconsidering that.

It

has reached the tentative conclusion that the marketplace is
sufficiently competitive so that broadcasters are most unlikely
to engage in excessive commercialization.
But I can't say at this point, of course, that the
Commission has gotten rid of those regulations entirely, but they
are processing guidelines and they Are quantitative rather thar

25

8

1

qualitative and they relate to a smaller portion of the broad­

2

cast day than entertainment programming.

3

QUESTION:

Well, this distinction between quantity

4

and quality becomes a little blurred, does it not, if quan­

5

titatively all or most of the program is devoted to one kind

6

of activity, namely, the athletics that I suggested in the

7

hypothetical?

8

service, by the failure to have any news broadcasts, by the

9

failure to have any educational broadcasts, any music?

Does that not come into the area of quality of

MR. SAYLOR:

10

The failure to have any news or public

11

affairs programming of any sort would be a matter of interest

12

and concern to the Commission, but the fact that it was sports

13

as opposed to something else that was occupying most of the

14

broadcast day, that would not be a matter which the Commission

15

would feel it's competent to evaluate.
The Commission does not believe that it has the

16

17

capacity to determine whether sports programming is more in

18

the interest of the public than a particular type of musical

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

programming.

And most of these cases, of course, have come up

in the context of one type of musical programming versus
another.

And especially in that instance the Commission

doubts that it has the capacity, the wherewithal to ascertain
what the public really wants, the intensity of preference on
the part of the public, and whether one group which prefers
one type of format outnumbers another group, and whether or
9

1

not the group which outnumbers would

2

programming.

QUESTION:

in

fact listen to the

I have to ask the question I wanted to

4

ask, and I don't mind asking after what you just said.

5

der to decide this case, I don't have to find out the differ­

6

ence between rock, hard rock, and jazz, do I?

7

MR. SAYLOR:

In or­

Mr. Justice Marshall, you do not need

8

to decide the difference between them but I do think that you

9

have to wrestle with the same problem the Commission has in

10

determining how the Commission in a given case would be able

11

to distinguish between different kinds of music in order to

12

judge whether or not a type of music is being abandoned and

13

there are no reasonable or adequate substitutes elsewhere in

14

the marketplace.

15

an esthetic value judgment which in most cases, administrative

16

law judges, commissioners, and Justices of this Court simply

17

can't have the knowledge to draw the distinctions, and even if,

18
19

20

21
22
23
24

That is a very difficult, subjective, almost

as happened before the administrative law judge in the WEFM
case, even if an expert is brought in, a musicologist, the
other side can just as easily bring in a musicologist on the
other side.
QUESTION:

Is there any real question under the

Court of Appeals opinion as to whether the Commission would
know whether a change is planned or had taken place?
MR. SAYLOR:

Mr. Justice White, there certainly are

25

10

1

some instances where the Commission would not have any diffi­

2

culty determining that a change had taken place.

3

difference between classical music arid country and western is

4

clear.
QUESTION:

5

Certainly the

Well, the limits of the Court of Appeals'

6

opinion as I understand it is that if a change is contemplated

7

the Commission should take into consideration whether or not

8

there's some -- whether it's economically sound and whether

9

there's a public market for it or a public demand for it.

10

And if it is, the Commission ought to really think about whe­

1 1

ther they ought to permit the change.
MR. SAYLOR:

12
13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

Is that the rule?

That's part of the test the Court of

Appeals -QUESTION:

Part ofLit,

but what do you think the

Court of Appeals held?
MR. SAYLOR:

The Court of Appeals held that the Com­

mission must hold a hearing if the format -QUESTION:

But the Court of Appeals said almost never

would a hearing be necessary.
MR. SAYLOR:

Well, they felt that there were not that

many protests and that there really wouldn't be a need for a
hearing in very many instances.
QUESTION:

But --

Well, then, is it right to say the Court

23
24

of Appeals said there must be a hearing every time?
MR. SAYLOR:

No, they did not.

25

11

They said that there

1

must be a hearing if four

2

First, the format must be arguably unique; secondly, there must

3

be significant public grumbling by those loyal to that particu­

4

lar format; third, the format must be one which could be --

5

the adherents of that format must be sufficiently numerous so

6

that one could say there are enough frequencies available in

7

the community so that in a technological sense their preference

8

could be satisfied.

9

raising a moment ago, there must either be a substantial mate­

threshold

requirements are met.

And fourth, the point that you were

10

rial question about the financial viability of the format or

1 1

as to whether or not that format could arguably become finan­

12

cially viable.
QUESTION:

13

Now, is it the Commission's submission

14

that considering those

15

is beyond the Commission's competence or that's just a wrong

16

construction of the statute?

17

that raises & First Amendment question.
HR. SAYLOR:

19

22
23
24

25

threshold, matters that you just listed

And I suppose you would suggest

The Commission's basic position is that

there's nothing in the statute which requires this type of
inquiry.

The second point of my argument today is that the

Commission's judgment as to what is or is not in the public
interest was a reasonable judgment.
Appeals'

And third, the Court of

approach to this matter raises serious First Amend­

ment reservations.
QUESTION:

Does this represent a change of mind by

the Commission, or has it always had this position?

The Commission has always had this posi

Commission was trying to determine how it could satisfy the --

QUESTION:

But prior to 1970 the Commission's posi-

tion was always what you say it should be today?

8

MR. SAYLOR

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
Or it is today?

MR. SAYLOR

10

Yes: that it's a matter for the licen-

11

see to decide what type of entertainment programming is most

He might be subject to those complaints

grounds ?
MR. SAYLOR
QUESTION:

Not on entertainment programming.
Not on entertainment, but on content of

the total broadcast, the use of the total broadcast time?
MR.

SAYLOR

Yes.

there have been licenses taken

away for violations of the Fairness Doctrine, which is in a
sense a content-related concept.

25

13

I believe licenses -- a few,

1

at least, have been taken away, or applications denied, for a

2

failure to indicate any desire to program news and public

3

affairs; information, not entertainment.

4

QUESTION:

What if the change that happens

to be at

issue in a renewal proceeding is an abandonment of any news

content in the broadcast day?

see abandons any kind of diversity in its program and goes to,

say, all sports, as the Chief Justice suggests, and no news,

9

no educational matters, and things like that.

10
11

Suppose in the midterm a licen­

Then, would

you say that's to be left to the marketplace completely?
MR. SAYLOR:

The Commission's position is that the

12

licensee does have discretion to change midterm from what the

13

licensee proposed at the outset of the license term.

14

if there is evidence that the licensee never intended to ful­

QUESTION: That isn't my question.

I mean they --

the licensee did intend to fulfill it at the outset and then
changed it, but.in the midterm it decides to change to all
sports or In a transfer proceeding the transferee proposes to
go to all sports, whereas his predecessor had a little variety
in his program.

Now, is that a -- would that be outside the

reach of the Commission?
MR. SAYLOR:

I think not. I think the Commission

would take a look at that to determine why the licensee thought
that it would be in the public interest to program --

QUESTION:

to, under the

statute to deny the transfer on that basis?

MR. SAYLOR:

3

Well, would the Commission have the power

I think the Commission would have the

4

authority under the statute to deny the transfer or to deny

5

renewal, but the inquiry -QUESTION:

6
7

that's involved here?

8

MR. SAYLOR:

9

QUESTION:
MR. SAYLOR:

10

11

12

13
14

17

18

I think it is.
Why is that?
The inquiry in that case would, if I

understand the hypothetical correctly, the inquiry would be
into the quantity of news and other non-entertainment program­
ming.

The licensee would have changed to zero percent pro­

gramming .
QUESTION:

15

16

Well, is that different than the issue

Well, public interest, convenience, and

necessity is virtually unbridled discretion unless it's some­
how filled in by the FCC, and how has the FCC filled it in in
this respect?
MR. SAYLOR:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would agree

19

with your characterization of the public interest standard.
20

The Commission years ago indicated that diversity was an im­
21

portant aspect of the public interest.

But in this context

22

the Commission concluded that there are two types of diversity
23

of ideas.

There is diversity between broad format categories

24

and in addition there is diversity within a format category.
25

15

There are perhaps over a hundred different types of

1

2

middle-of-the-road programming.

Middle-of-the-road is a clas­

3

sification.

4

Marshall's question, many different types of rock music.

5

The Commission felt that there are two different types of

6

diversity and the Commission is not in a position to choose

7

between one and the other.

8

stantial differences within a given format category.

9

tion there are other public interest considerations, other

There are, as I think was implicit in Justice

Listeners do indeed identify sub­
In addi­

10

considerations which fall into this rubric of the public in­

1 1

terest .
One is the idea that the licensee should have wide

12

13

discretion.

14

that concept, in several decisions recently, including the

15

Midwest Video II case, and the case of CBS v. Democratic

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

This Court has indicated as much, its approval of

National Committee.

In addition, the concept of how to balance

and accommodate these different interests is one which this
Court has said is appropriately a matter for Commission discre­
tion.

Here the Commission concluded that it simply lacked

the capacity to decide what is most in the public interest
in the case of two different competing types of entertainment
programming.
QUESTION:

Well, is it the Commission's position that

23

if there's a proposal to switch from one kind of diversity to
24

another, that's the business of the broadcaster?
25

16

1

MR. SAYLOR:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
But if a broadcaster wants to shift from

3

a program that's got some diversity in it to a thoroughly

4

unique program, all one-sided or all one content, that he is

5

in trouble?
MR. SAYLOR:

6

Only insofar as under the current

7

guidelines the licensee would be neglecting news and informa­

8

tional programming entirely.
QUESTION:

9

10

transfer may not go through; right?
MR. SAYLOR:

11

12

13
14

15

16

17

18
19

20
21

22

Well, he may not get renewal then, or the

see's explanation.

Perhaps, but it depends upon the licen­

If the Commission concludes that the

licensee has done it in good faith and believes that it is in
the public interest, then the Commission would not prevent
renewal.
QUESTION:

So your suggestion is that these are

exactly the kinds of judgments

of

the public interest

that the Commission ought to make rather than a court?
MR. SAYLOR:

Absolutely.

Furthermore, there is

nothing -- as I said earlier, that’s -- on the face of the
statute or in its legislative history or anything that’s impli
cit in the statute that would indicate the approach taken by
the Court of Appeals is mandatory.

QUESTION:

But if you suggest that all of those

24

things that we've just been talking about, are they equally

suspect under the First Amendment?
MR. SAYLOR:

I guess you can't say that.

I think that4 if -- by different things

you mean the amount of entertainment programming or the qual­

4

ity of the entertainment programming?

QUESTION:

The shift from -- is it equally suspect

6

under the First Amendment to object to shifting to uniqueness

7

as it is to shift from one diversity to another?

8

MR. SAYLOR:

QUESTION:

10
1 1

I don't think there's -I don't understand your First Amendment

argument then.
MR. SAYLOR:

The First Amendment argument really re­

12

lates to -- it is not that the First Amendment -- except in

13

the area of chilling experimentation the Commission did not

14

conclude that there would be a First Amendment bar.

15

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

They did

believe that the impact upon experimentation, on licensees who
would want to try unique format, would be adverse, counterpro­
ductive even to the objective of the Court of Appeals.

So in

that area the Commission viewed the situation as creating an
impermissible chilling effect.
But otherwise, I think the Commission's concern was
with the values of the First Amendment.

The greater the degree

of Commission intrusion, the greater the portion of the broadcase day which is affected, the greater the amount to which

23

the Commission is entangled in making value judgments about
24

programming, the more the First Amendment is implicated.
25

18

1

It is a balancing of different values, and certainly in this

2

case involving entertainment programming the Commission felt

3

that the balance tipped very much in favor of leaving the

4

judgment to licensee discretion.
QUESTION:

5

Mr.

Saylor, when a license is initially

6

granted, particularly where you have competition between two

7

applicants, is entertainment program format relevant in the

8

Commission's view?
MR. SAYLOR:

9

The Commission has never indicated that

10

entertainment programming would be decisionally significant in

1 1

a comparative case.

mission is

Why has it done it -- it's done this for

MR. SAYLOR:

The Commission has gathered the infor­

than anything else, but the publicly available sources are

6

sufficient to provide that information so I think the Commis­

7

sion might well reconsider even asking for that information.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS AMERICAN BROADCASTING
COS., INC., ET AL., S NATL. ASSN. OF BROADCASTERS ET AL.
MR. DYK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
What we have in this case, of course, is a policy
judgment by the Commission not to engage in a particular kind
of regulation of broadcast programming.

And that fact alone

distinguishes this case from many of the other situations
about which the Court was asking.

Because in those situations

the Commission has determined to engage in program regulation
25

20

1

2

in its view of the public interest.
The Congress in 1927 and again in 1934 charged the

3

Commission with the task of determining what is in the public

4

interest in broadcasting.

5

the programming area that of course requires the drawing of

6

very delicate and difficult lines.

7

involving such questions to come before this Court and I'm

8

sure it will not be the last.

9

has reached a policy judgment that regulation would not serve

And when the Commission gets into

This is not the first case

But where the Commission as here

10

the public interest the Court of Appeals should not substitute

11

its judgment for the Commission and impose a regulatory regime

12

which the Commission is very much opposed to.

13

QUESTION:

Going back, Mr. Dyk, to this question in

14

the application, either an initial application or a transfer

15

with a new transferee, is the question in your view directed

16

— questions about program content -- and they do; the Commis­

17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

sion does ask about that -- is that directed at determining
whether there is the appropriate diversity or is it directed
at the quantitative aspects of a particular program?
MR. DYK:

The Commission asks a number of questions

on the form about programming, including the quantity of news,
public affairs, informational programming.

It asks questions

about so-called ascertainment of community needs, an obliga­
tion which the Commission has imposed to require the broad­
caster to go out in the community and interview the general
21

1

public and community leaders to determine the problems, needs,

2

and interests of the community.

3

to make lists of these problems and to propose programming

4

responsive to them.

5

There are other questions on the form also

6

to the amount of commercials.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DYK:

9

The broadcaster is required

relating

In addition to all of that --

Is this the form for an original license?
It would both be on the form for an origi­

nal license and for a renewal of license though the amount of

10

details required is somewhat different.

11

the broadcaster has been asked in the past a question about

12

format.

13

how this contributed to diversity?

14

been eliminated from the form because the Commission thought

15

that it was inappropriate to get into those areas.

16

But on both of those

And at one time there was a question there that asked
That second question has

But despite the existence of these questions on the

17

form, the Commission has never gotten into the question of

18

whether a particular format should be abandoned or whether a

19

broadcaster should be required to continue with a particular

20
21

22
23
24

25

format, because of the Commission's view that that intrudes
very much in the area of program content.
As to why the question is on the form, I think one
needs perhaps to understand a little bit of the history of it.
When the Commission first got into business of applying the publ ic
interest standard, there were many fewer broadcast stations
22

1

than there are today.

2

which I think about 1,000 are public stations.

3

a few hundred at the time, originally.

4

view in the early days was that -- and this was the view of

5

broadcasters also, that there should be a general approach to

6

programming, and they had various categories and broadcasters

7

were thought to pretty much have the same programming approach,

8

and that conformed to what broadcasters wanted to do at that

9

time.

There are about 8,500 of them now, of
There were onl^

And the Commissions

10

Part of the implication at that time was that a spe­

11

cialized format such as we have now in great abundance because

12

of the large number of stations ,

13

and so on, that that might raise special public interest ques­

14

tions, so the question on the form really arose because the

15

Commission was concerned that at some point that the move to

16

these specialized formats and away from a more general program­

17

ming approach might itself be something with which the Commis­

18

sion should concern itself.

19

the present experience and the great diversity that exists,

20

has recognized that most stations now, perhaps 90 percent of

21

them, have these specialized formats, and it really has deter­

22

mined that it should not regulate.

For example, WMAL I think, in this.

city, might be viewed by some people as having a more general

3

programming approach, news, music, talk, and so on.

4

of the stations have a specialized format, whether it be clas­

5

sical or rock or middle-of-the-road, beautiful music, all news;

6

there's an immense variety of them, depending on how you cate­

7

gorize them.

of different formats.

But most

how you treat the news, where you place it, the style, the pace
of the station.

And these are things that appeal very differ­

ently to different members of the audience, so that someone
might see a great difference between one station

which clas­

sifies itself as a rock station and another station which also
may classify itself as a rock station, but the sound of those
stations, their quality and their approach, may be very, very
different and mean very, very different things to the listener.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, when the Commission has reached

18

its determination along these lines, that it would not be in
19

the public interest to regulate as it has, what is the standard
20

of review which the Court of Appeals applies to review that
21

decision?
22

MR. DYK:

The Commission decision not to regulate?

23

I would suppose under the statute it's an arbitrary and capri­
24

cious standard.

But here we're dealing with a situation where

25

24

1

there's no specific statutory language requiring this regula­

2

tion, where there's no legislative history suggesting that the

3

Commission should do it.

4

legislative history, we think, suggesting that this kind of a

5

qualitative approach to programming, whether it be in the en­

6

tertainment area or the news area or any other area, is some­

7

thing that the Commission is not supposed to do.

8

supposed to set --

QUESTION:

10

MR. DYK:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

And indeed, there is very specific

It's not

Well, that's the contrary to law standard.
Pardon me?

Yes.

You're suggesting it's the contrary to

law standard?
MR. DYK:

Yes.

I think that's what the Court of

14

Appeals viewed it as, and they suggested that what the Commis­

15

sion was doing was contrary to law.

16

what difficult to find in the statute any legal requirement

17

18
19

20

21

22

I think we find it some­

that the Commission engage in this very kind of intrusive regu­
lation where the First Amendment and the statute and the his­
tory of the statute and the policy of the statute reflected in
this Court's decisions in CBS and Midwest Video all counsel
against a very intrusive kind of Commission regulation that
would be involved here.
QUESTION:

The law being public interest, convenience

23
24

and necessity?
MR. DYK:

That is apparently what the Court

25

25

viewed

1

as governing here, and —

2
3

QUESTION:

Is there any other statute for it to fall

back on?

4

MR. DYK:

I think not.

No, I think that is the only

5

provision that they could rely on, and it is the only provision

6

that they relied on here.

7

some other general portion of the statute in one of the other

8

earlier decisions, just about the larger use of radio or some­

9

thing like that, but that's equally general and this Court in

I think there was some reference to

10

NCCB suggested that that is not a ground for the Court of

11

Appeals telling the Commission what to do.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Dyk, as I understand your position,

13

the statute does not require the Commission to take the view

14

that the Court of Appeals took:

15

Do you think the statute would have permitted the Commission to

16

adopt the same rule that the Court of Appeals has in effect

17

forced them to adopt?
MR. DYK:

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

here.

they must follow these factors.

That, of course, is not a question that's

But I think the answer is clearly, no, that the Commis­

sion could not have adopted that kind of intrusive regulation.
QUESTION:

Even if it thought this was the appro­

priate way to achieve diversity?
MR. DYK:

Yes, I think that is true.

Because when

the Commission gets down into this question of prohibiting the
broadcaster from presenting a particular kind of program, as
26

1

this Court recognized in Red Lion, as this Court recognized in

2

Pacifica while sustaining the particular Commission ruling

3

there, there are very substantial First Amendment and statutory

4

questions. And for the Commission to get into this area of

5

regulation would require it to make the most elusive and sub­

6

jective kinds of judgments.
QUESTION:

7

8

Do you say that for a constitutional rea­

son or a statutory reason or both?
MR. DYK:

9

Both.

The statutory reason relating to

10

this history of Commission regulation; the 1927 Act where

1 1

Congress adopted very few provisions in the Act requiring spe­

12

cific regulation of programming; Section 315, of course;

13

Section 1464, which was involved in Pacifica. And at the same

14

time it rejected many, many other proposals to require more

15

intrusive regulation of programming, including the priorities

16

provision which I had mentioned a moment ago, a provision to

17

18
19

20
21

require equal time for the discussion of public issues, provi­
sions to prohibit various kinds of discrimination against pro­
gramming.

adopted Section 326 and in 1934 adopted Section 3(h) which this
Court has discussed in its various decisions.
And in order to avoid these constitutional questions

22
23
24

25

And the Congress rejected all of these, and instead

one looks back at the statute and finds that the Congress was
deeply concerned about Commission intrusion into program con­
tent -27

QUESTION:

then, it is not that the Commission has made the policy judg­
ment; rather that Congress has made this policy judgment.

MR. DYK:

not to intrude, and that that alone is sufficient to sustain
the Commission -QUESTION:

But you do also contend that

made precisely the same policy judgment?

My argument, Mr. Justice Stevens, is, both.

That the Commission in this case has made the policy judgment

That is correct, Your Honor.

You mentioned that 90 percent of all the

stations have a particular format?

QUESTION:

Specialized format.

Suppose the Commis­

15

sion was confronted with a situation

16

served by five radio stations, we will assume.

embraces, and the fifth one comes in and says, they can do a

No, it would not and it could not, and the

reason that it would not, or one of the reasons that it would

25

are assuming is not the way the market works.
28

It's a very

dynamic market, a very competitive market, it's a terribly

And one of the things that the Commission strongly sug­

1 1

came into being in the late 1960s.

12

Robinson suggested this before.

13

innovation would never have occurred if the Court of Appeals

14

regulatory regime had been in effect, because a broadcaster is

20
21

for example, the all news format, which
Many people and Commissioner

Many people believed that that

extremely reluctant to get himself into a situation where he
adopts an innovative format, finds that it does not work, and
then is barred from changing that without having to go through
a lengthy and expensive hearing, all the while, perhaps,
losing very, very substantial amounts of money.

The WEFM sta­

tion involved in one of these earlier cases lost about $2
million under the format that was involved in that case, and
of course a hearing was held to be required because the Court

22

said, well, maybe you didn't lose the $2 million because of
23

the format, maybe you lost it because of mismanagement or some­
24

thing like that.

So, the hearing that would be required in

25

29

1

many, many of these cases is a very substantial deterrent to a

2

broadcaster who is thinking of changing the format.
QUESTION:

3

Then, are you saying that in this hypothe­

4

tical, four stations, all rock music, and another one that

5

is a

6

music, is going to shift to the rock pattern and a half a dozen

7

community organizations come in, the symphony or the opera

8

society, choral groups, religious groups, and say, this commun­

9

ity is saturated with rock music, there should be one station

10

which will have a broad base, religious music, opera, classi­

1 1

cal music, semi-classical, popular, the Commission wouldn't

12

hear that, I take it?

13

15

16
17

18
19

so-called good music station with a variety of classical

MR. DYK:

It would not hear that and it would not

need to because if such a demand existed it would be met by
broadcasters in the market.
QUESTION:

We find in a number of these --

Well, where do you -- from what do you

draw that statement?
MR. DYK:
change in New York.

Well, for example, there was a recent
I think that it was, the call letters were

WRVR, which was a jazz station, which changed its jazz format
20

to country music, and almost immediately a couple of other sta­
21

tions in the market expanded their jazz programming.

They came

22

in to fill that gap.

There's a substantial amount of evidence

23

in the record that that sort of thing happens.

If someone

24

abandons a format and there is a great need for that kind of
25

30

1

programming, a great demand for it, someone will come in and

2

do it.

3

where — for example, in the Atlanta case, the Voice of the

4

Arts in Atlanta, a case which was decided by the Court of

5

Appeals, they relied on this survey that purportedly showed

6

that 16 percent of the people in that market really preferred

7

classical music.

8

survey.

9

like 16 percent of the people listening to that station.

But the problem is that in some of these situations

Well, there were lots of defects to that

But the major defect is that there wasn't anything
It

10

was less than one percent.

If 16 percent of the people in that

1 1

market had wanted classical music, there wouldn't have been one

12

classical music station; there probably would have been three

13

of them, because that's an enormous market share.

14

The only way that listener preferences can really be

15

determined here is by allowing the marketplace to work, allow­

16

ing broadcasters to innovate and change, based on their

17

hunches, based on their own surveys to try to meet the demands

18

of the audience.
QUESTION:

19

20
21

and '34 acts has in effect mandated that the marketplace and
nothing else is to govern?
MR. DYK:

22
23
24

Are you saying that Cbngress in the '27

Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that that

would be going a little far.

I think that Congress obviously

contemplated that in some areas the Commission would have to
intervene.

Since 1959, I assume, or when Congress adopted the

25

31

1

Fairness Doctrine as part of the statute, that that is one of

2

those areas, and one of the parts of the Fairness Doctrine,

3

the so-called first part of the Fairness Doctrine, is that

4

broadcasters have to present controversial issue programming.

5

So, in your example of the station which did nothing

6

but program all sports, as Mr. Saylor said, that probably would

7

raise an issue of compliance with the Fairness Doctrine, be­

8

cause the broadcaster wouldn't be serving the public by total

9

absence of information programs.

10
11

12

QUESTION:

But that's because of a specific statu­

tory provision.
MR. DYK:

Yes, a specific statutory provision, which

13

obviously we do not have here.

14

because of the dynamism of the radio market and because of the

15

16
17

18
19

20

21
22
23

And I think that the Commission

large number of stations, because of the very kinds of subjec­
tive judgments that they would have to make here, was correct
in concluding that it could determine not to impose this par­
ticular kind of intrusive regulation.

The kinds of distinc­

tions that would have been required, or would be required by
the Court of Appeals' regime, are terribly subjective between
fine arts stations and classical stations, between contempo­
rary music and progressive rock, and even in one case which
isn't recorded in F.2d -- it's the W0N0 case, the allegation
was that the selections that the broadcaster was choosing were

24

incongruous and unadventurous.

And the court said, well,

25

32

1

you've got to have a hearing to see whether under those cir­

2

cumstances there's a unique format that's been abandoned and

3

that the Commission should raise a public interest question.

4

So it's those kinds of very intrusive judgments that would have

5

to be’ made here .

6

Now, in addition,

of course, to the specific priori­

7

ties provision that was deleted from the statute, the Congress,

8

as this Court has recognized in CBS and Midwest Video, decided

9

to set up a system of public trusteeship leaving to the broad­

10

caster, by and large, the specific programming judgments.

11

just as this Court in the CBS case said that to require a

12

general system of access, as the court, the same court has

13

required there, would be to abandon this editorial role for

14

very speculative gains ,

15

kind of speculative gains is all that one could hope from the

16

regulatory regime which the Court of Appeals would impose, and

17

as the Commission found, the gains would not only be specula­

18

tive, but there would be this very, very adverse effect on

19

innovation, experimentation, and the operation of the market­

20
21

22
23
24

25

And

so it would seem here, that the same

place .

repeatedly mischaracterized what the D.C. Circuit has been

doing as some intrusion into policy, as some rewriting of the

Well, the regulatory agency and the Court

of Appeals don't have quite the same view of the statute, do
they?
MS. GLEN:

Well, they certainly don't, Your Honor,

but certainly it is a premise of the separation of powers in
this country, that a court's construction of the statute is
ultimately binding.

Now, obviously you have it within your

If you look at the statutory scheme,

I think you meant at the argument here, what Congress did was
set up a comprehensive licensing scheme to deal with the
electromagnetic spectrum.

And what it also did was say that we

will choose among various applicants if there are choices; if
there are none, we will look at the applicant who comes in to
decide who will best serve the public interest convenience and

Section 309(a) states -- and it is the mandatory

quality of the statute, I think, that the D. C. Circuit is
dealing with, again and again, and which takes us away from
the Commission's decision that it is its policy not to make
judgments — 309(a) says that in each application the Commis­

23

sion "shall determine whether the public interest, convenience,
24

and necessity would be served by granting."

Finally, Section 309(d)(2) provides that if a sub­
stantial and material question of fact is presented or if the
Commission for any reason is unable to find that the grant of
the application -- and again this would be either the initial
application, the renewal, or the transfer -- would be consist­
ent with Subsection (a):

In every other situation where diversity is

at issue, the Commission looks from, starting from the applica­
tion for an initial license where contrary to counsel's
position, on the radio license form 301, and it's in Footnote 7
of our brief, the citation, the question is asked, what pro­
gramming do you propose and how does it contribute to overall
diversity?

They don't ask that on television licenses, and I

think that that's a clear choice, understanding that there's a
conscious choice, to look for diversity within a service area

MS. GLEN:

Or if it --

Well, what the most recent case says, it's

the case called Cameron, which again is cited in our brief,
it says that the comparative merit will be given only to a li­
censee who proposes a unique format, and that is a unique for­
mat , obviously, in the service area.

So if there are already

18

four Spanish language stations, he gets nothing.

22

Well, if the Commission is saying

this, why did the Court of Appeals overrule?
MS. GLEN:

Because they say it in every situation

except the single situation which is before you here and which
was before “the Commission in the policy statement.

And that

is, where the question is not an increase in diversity because
a broadcaster is proposing a unique format or increasing di­
versity by some specialized program, but where listeners,
where the very public who were let into these proceedings in
1966 by the UCC case says, this proposed abandonment of a uni­
que format will decrease diversity.

MS. GLEN:

Earlier -- well, the de­

cision that was reviewed in WEFM, which was the first en banc
format case in the D. C. Circuit, in fact had appended to it
a policy statement that Commissioner Burch -- that Commissioner
Burch wrote and that other commissioners joined in, in which he
said -- and this is what's very interesting, because there is
no disagreement here between the Court of Appeals and this

And that that's what the statute requires.
But, it's pretty clear, I think, from

the decisions of this Court

as far back as Ashbacker Radio,

that when the statute requires a procedure, when the statute
requires a hearing between competing applicants, as was the
case in Ashbacker, or as here where material and substantial
questions going to the public interest are raised, that the
fact that the Commission, even given its expertise and what­
ever, thinks than another procedure might be better, is simply
not permissible.
That Is in a sense what happened in UCC.

The Commis­

sion said, we don't have to let these people in, we don't have
23
24

to give them standing, and we're not going to hold a hearing.
Justice Burger said, this is a procedural case.

25

50

In Ashbacker

the Commission said, we think it would be better to just grant

this application and put the competing application to the side

and hold a hearing later, because it would be in the public

interest to get somebody on the air.
And this Court said, no.

a right to a hearing.

the statutory scheme says that they do have to regulate, that

14

there do have to be choices made about who will use this scarce

15

resour ce.

16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

25

But we have a statutory scheme right now, and

And, for better or worse, that choice is on the
Commission and at least the Commission is in some senses demo­
cratically responsible.

For them to say, the marketplace will

make the choice, we won't look, is to put the power to decide
what shall be heard and who will be served not in people who
are responsible to the President and the Congress but to people
with marketplace forces.

And that is precisely the scheme that

the Congress eschewed by developing a licensing system in the
first place.
QUESTION:

But you could say alternatively that the
51

1

Commission has decided that the public interest, convenience,

2

and necessity are best served by the marketplace allocation

3

force.
MS. GLEN:

4

Your Honor, the Commission must make in

5

cases in this Court, from as far back as Pottsville, through

6

NBC and RKO, to discussion in the National Citizens Communica­

7

tions for Broadcasting case, about the broad rule that the

8

D. C.

9

Talk about the Commission's, the requirement that the Commission

Circuit would have imposed in terms of cross-ownership.

10

make an individualized determination, and to say, we're not

11

going to make determinations, we're not going to look, we're

12
13
14

15

16

17

18
19

20
21

22

just going to let the marketplace do it, is to say we will not
make that individualized determination.

And I think that

that's really related to the right that the statute creates
for a hearing.
QUESTION:

If that's the way they construed the

statute, admittedly it's contrary to the Court of Appeals
construction.

But it would not require a hearing, an individ­

ualized hearing in every case.

They say, we're going to let

the marketplace do it.
MS. GLEN:

But if the marketplace were to be allowed

to make these decisions, then you wouldn't have comparative
renewal hearings, you wouldn't have initial renewal hearings,

23

you wouldn't have the Commission making choices in every other
24

situation about who will best serve the public.
25

52

And that's the

1

question that's being asked here, where someone says, I'm going

2

to abandon the only Spanish language format, or I'm going to

3

abandon the only classical format, or the only black format,

4

is that person best serving the public interest?

5

mission cannot avoid that determination under this statutory

6

scheme.

And the Com­

In NCCB you said the reason that it's okay to not

7

8

have an across-the-board rule about divestiture and concentra­

9

tion is because the rights of both competing applicants and

10

petitioners to deny, under 309, are protected because the Com­

1 1

mission will make an individualized determination in each case

12

where those issues are raised, whether the concentration issue

13

so substantially affects the public interest that the license

14

should be denied or that it should be given to someone else.
QUESTION:

Some of this discussion has left me a

little bit confused, but maybe you can clear it up.

You'll

recall the hypothetical I gave to your friends on the other
side of the table about the community with five radio stations,
four of them already in rock, and the fifth one is going to
move — arid this is either on a renewal or at any time -- going
to move into all rock, because rock is doing so well.

Now,

what's your position on the scope’of the Commission's author­
22

ity to weigh the diversity of programming over the whole com­
23

munity and

over all of the stations?

and someone else comes in and says, here's this fellow who's

Nobody but the public knows better.

Well, but that wasn't a decision of this

Court.

of this Court and commentators and whatever that I think that

4

there's not a lot of question.

but it's a very important and very substantial explication of

what the Act is about, why Congress has chosen this licensing

That holding went only to to the parties that

MS. GLEN:

It's not substantive, but what it says

frequently the best judges of the service that is being given

to them, and the Act provides that they are entitled to service.

GLEN:

Well, but Justice Stewart, it's not just

their tastes or whether they listen, it's whether they have

6

dollars to spend on products that advertisers wish to adver­

Listeners to country

12

and western are at least perceived by advertisers as having

13

good demographics, as having high disposable income, and there­

14

fore you may see four country and western stations or five

15

rock stations,because those consumers are favored consumers,

and nothing that broadcasts to the elderly, little that broad­

I mean, that's

what in a sense the legislative history that's talked about
throughout all the briefs talks about.

And that's not at issue

here; we're not talking about allocations.
57

What we are talking

1

about, though, is that where there is diversity, where there

2

isn't a minority taste or a minority ethnic or a minority age

3

group, a group of listeners who after all own the air waves

4

just as much as the people who buy pimple cream, that when that

5

minority —

6

QUESTION:

They might be the same people.

7

MS. GLEN:

Hopefully not.

-- when that minority is

8

being served and a broadcaster says, I don't want to do that

9

anymore, I'd rather play rock and make more money, that that is

10

a legitimate question, that that decrease in diversity, that

1 1

decrease in service to that minority audience is a part of the

12

public interest that the Commission should look at in deciding

13

whether to renew the license or grant the transfer, or what­

14

ever.

15

it doesn't require that -- the D. C. Circuit in the opinion

16

below is extraordinarily careful to say how very limited its

17

holding is, that the Commission has no power to tell people

18

they must retain formats or what they must play.

19

must look at the effect on diversity of the loss of the unique

20

format, what that's raised by a substantial group of the

21

22
23
24

25

It doesn't have to decide it in favor of keeping format;

It simply

public.
QUESTION:

But if the issue is raised, you have to

assume there will be some cases in which they would tell the
licensee, you must continue the same format.
MS. GLEN:

Well, Your Honor, they don't tell the
58

1

licensee he must continue.

2

Every licensee who has no property right beyond the three

3

years knows — it doesn't happen frequently -- but knows that

4

if somebody comes along and says, I'll do better, that the Com­

5

mission has the absolute power, although it chooses not to

6

exercise it very frequently, to replace him with someone who

7

will serve better.

8

QUESTION:

Every licensee runs on his record.

Well, is it not part of your position

9

that in a given transfer application that would involve a dra­

10

matic change of format, that there would be some case in which

11

the public could come in and convince the Commission that they

12

should not allow the change to take place because they want to

13

retain the old format, it's in the public interest to retain

14

the old format?

15

MS. GLEN:

Your Honor, that's absolutely right and

16

it doesn't compel anyone to do anything.

17

licensee clearly has no right to --

QUESTION:

The prospective

they want to do.
MS. GLEN:
clearly is out of it.

Well, no, the prospective licensee
He has no right to the license at all.

So that the fact that he is being told, we don't need more
rock, certainly doesn't violate his rights in any way.

And

the present licensee is simply being told, if you don't want tc
program this, you can go away.

If somebody else wants to
59

1

program this format, we're going to give them a preference be­

2

cause this is a minority portion of the community that deserves

3

service under the universal service standard of the Act, and

4

that the public interest would best be served.

5

pelled to continue; there is not a common carrier obligation.

6

But the other side of common carrier, and I think it's impor­

7

tant to look at this, is that licensees don't get financial

8

and economic protection from the Commission either.

9

what the Sanders Brothers case says.

No one is com­

And this Court held, that's not what it's about.

The Commission's interest,

interest in profits.

the Commission's vindication of the

That's hot the Commission's concern unless it involves

ultimately a decrease or a diminution of the public service.
He's not a common carrier, he's not entitled to protection.
QUESTION: When you get down to the question of diver­
sity, it sounds quite easy and manageable when you start
60

1

talking, or when you first think of it, but when you start

2

thinking of examples of it, there is going to be kind of hang­

3

ing over the head of any programmer who -- as Justice Stevens

4

suggests -- who wants to abandon a unique format, the threat

5

that his license would be not renewed at the end of the three-

6

year period.

7

weigh diversity?.
MS. GLEN:

8
9

Now, to what extent does the Commission have to

Well, Your Honor, that obviously -- let

me answer that in two ways.

One is to just restate, in case

10

this is troubling you at all, that it's perfectly clear that

1 1

this Court has held numerous times that the First Amendment is

12
13
14

15

16
17

18
19

20

not violated by not renewing a licensee because someone else
will better serve the public.

The question of how diversity

is implicated or weighed is a fact question in every case.
It's precisely the kind of fact question that the Commission
decides all the time.

And in fact it's very illustrative that

in the ten years that the Commission has lived under First
Voice of Atlanta and then WEFM and now this case, that it has
found in various instances that diversity is not terribly af­
fected.

There was a case recently; this is a station in

Cincinnati, where the Commission said there are three other
21

stations in the market that play roughly the same thing, there­
22

fore diversity won't really be affected, therefore there
23

doesn't have to be a hearing, therefore it doesn't impact on
24

the public interest in such a way that you lose your license.
25

61

1

QUESTION:

The only reason you have a hearing- is: be­

2

cause there's an issue of fact that could result in some dif­

3

ferent outcome.

4

is have a hearing isn't dispositive of the case, because if

5

you're having a hearing it must be about some meaningful con­

6

tested issue of fact that will result in a different outcome

7

depending on how it's decided.
MS. GLEN:

8
9

I mean, just to say that all you have to do

That's true, Your Honor, but there might

also be situations -- and sadly enough, since I represent a lot

10

of classical music lovers -- there are situations where very

1 1

unique formats are abandoned, and there is not the sufficient

12

public grumbling which the D. C. Circuit has said must occur,

13

and nothing happens at all.

14

ride.

15

by virtue of having a license is entitled to be protected

16

against the vicissitudes of a system premised on a choice

17

among licensees for who will best serve the public.

18

And that licensee gets a free

But he's not entitled to economic protection.

QUESTION:

Nobody

Well, then, if the public is the ultimate

19

arbiter, as in your view, why should public grumbling from

20

more than one citizen be required, in order to hold a hearing

21

on diversity?

22
23
24

25

MR. GLEN:

Well, Your Honor, because the whole point

is, is the public interest in diversity being affected?

If a

number of people come forward and say, this is terrible, that
we're losing this Spanish format, or terrible that we're not
62

1

going to have classical music anymore; there are 400,000 of us,

2

we've listened to it and we love it. Then that goes to the im­

3

pact on diversity which is part of the public interest stan­

4

dard, which the Commission has to decide.

5

example, that the first black station or the first Haitian

6

station in New York will be offered instead, and that that

7

offsets the loss in diversity.

8
9

It may decide, for

It's clearly a fact determination but it's not a
fact determination any different from the determination that

10

the Commission makes in a comparative situation where a broad­

1 1

caster says, give me the license because I'm going to do some­

12

thing you need, because I'm going to contribute to diversity.

13

And, in fact, across the board the Commission looks at this

14

kind of programming.

15

As recently as in one of the RKO license renewals

16

that have been going on, RKO was allowed to show meritorious

17

service because it broadcast -- this was the station in Los

18

Angeles — because it broadcast concerts of the Los Angeles

19

20
21

22
23
24

Philharmonic.

The Commission looks at this all the time when

broadcasters raise it.

There is no question that it is part

of the public interest.
QUESTION:

Ms. Glen, do you agree with opposing

counsel that the Commission's statement of policy and the Court
of Appeals decision in this case relate both to program changes
that have been made and those that are proposed to be made?

25

63

1

MS. GLEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Clearly, the

Court of

2

Appeals has spoken and again, very carefully, grounded their

3

decision in the language of the statute.

4

you and tell you that when we started litigating these cases

5

we had hoped that we could challenge format changes whenever

6

they occurred because we felt their impact on the public

7

interest and diversity was so great.
The Court of Appeals has very carefully grounded

8
9

10

I must be frank with

this in the statutory requirement that on its decision on these
applications the Commission must make a determination.

1 1

QUESTION:

On renewals or on transfers.

12

MS. GLEN:

So that it is only renewals and transfers

13

that are involved here.
QUESTION:

14

Well, but that wasn't really my question.

15

Yes, I understand that you're in agreement that it only applies

16

to renewals and transfers.
MS. GLEN:

17

18
19

20

21

22
23
24

I'm sorry, perhaps I misunderstood your

question.
QUESTION:

But does it apply to program changes

that have been made as well as those that are proposed to be
made to both?
MS. GLEN:

Oh, of course, Your Honor. For example,

opinion here, when that license comes up for renewal, if in

fact the 50,000 people who have

1 1

joined by 200,000 more and there is a substantial showing that

12

there is a need and a unique service here and a community

13

that's served, and financial viability for the format, then it

QUESTION:

And I think that's -- it's also

It will be equally true in a renewal or

transfer proceeding in the Commission under the Court of
Appeals decision and the Commission's statement of policy that
if the proposed transferee or if the applicant for renewal
said, if this transfer is affected or if the renewal of my. li­
cense is effected, I'm going to change my programming format.
MS. GLEN:

If he said that?

QUESTION:

Yes.

This would also be applicable.
65

1

MS. GLEN:

Of course it would.

2

QUESTION:

Both the changes that have been made --

3

MS. GLEN:

Right.

4

QUESTION:

-- and those proposed to be made.

5

MS. GLEN:

Exactly.

Of course it would.

And obviously, the licensees,

6

I think as a practical matter, at this point, if it's not a

7

transfer situation, have figured out that it's better to do it

8

mid-license term because maybe by the time the license comes

9

up the public grumbling will disperse or people will be hap­

10

QUESTION:

That's the

How large a segment of the public does it

have to be?
MS. GLEN:

Well --

QUESTION:

Supposing, instead of your 300,000

MS. GLEN:

Your Honor, that's really -- that goes

to the problem with the inquiry here.

This Commission was

told by the D. C. Circuit in saying, this is your statutory
obligation, why don't you go make standards?

Why don't you go

devise procedures that will help you to deal with this?

We

don't want to wipe you out although I must say there have been

MS. GLEN:

The public interest?

The statute that says, before a transfer

or a renewal can be granted the Commission must make a determi­

have been somewhat misguided -- states, "For duty, duty must

23
24

25

In the

context of the third point we'd like to discuss the Commis­
sion's 11th hour suggestion that these formats were not covered
by the opinion under review.
With respect to the totality of program service on
radio, we think that the industry's and the FCC's attempt to
minimize the importance of the issue of format diversity by
71

1

characterizing it as simply entertainment not only ignores

2

this Court's decision in Red Lion but also ignores the particu­

QUESTION:

heritage

Ms. Cooke, let me ask you this.

as

Suppose

7

someone opens a theater in a particular community, large com­

8

munity of New York or San Antonio where most of the people are

9

Spanish-speaking; at least, that's their primary language;

10

a theater, or a movie theater, or a bookstore.

1 1

are they're not going to do very well if they don't put on

12

Spanish language movies or sell Spanish language books.

13

that reasonable?

14

MS. COOKE:

QUESTION:

And the odds

That may be true.
Now, well, isn't that likely to be true as

16

a matter of economics?

17

chasers want in that neighborhood, they're not likely to give

18

25

If you aren't selling what the pur­

Now, how far do you carry that when you

move out of the private theater, which can put on whatever
kind of movies it wants, in any language it wants, Bulgarian,
or Yugoslav, whether they have customers of not, to a radio stati on,
and how do you make the distinction?

How much response must

the Commission require?
MS. COOKE:

We start from the premise in the particu­

lar hypothetical that you've posited, that the aura
72

of First

1

Amendment rights in the broadcasting spectrum is somewhat dif­

2

ferent, that this Court has always differentiated between the

3

kinds of protections involved in other First Amendment areas ,

4

print and so forth, and broadcast.

5

because of the scarcity arguments and also because of the pub­

6

lic ownership, and because of the licensing scheme which de­

7

clares that in order -- because all cannot speak, then some

8

mechanism must be available so that many thoughts can be heard,

9

that the order is different.

And that, in broadcast,

But even in the context of format the Commission has

10
11

always said that it is not the tastes of individual persons

12

that is to be acknowledged necessarily, but that substantial

13
14

15

16

17

segments of a population must be addressed.

Where in broadcast

a radio situation will come in and the segment of the community
that is unserved is 20 or 30 percent, or whatever particular
standard the Commission devises, then that is a substantial
segment, and as part of the public owners of the air waves, it is
a consideration in terms of diversity.

And so that the order

18

and the concerns are different in the theater and the private
19

enterprise system, and that when we are dealing with

a

li­

20

censing system in which there is not ownership and property
21

rights.
22

I think the other question that makes the broadcast
23

situation vastly different is that in non-entertainment situa­
24

tions the Commission has neglected to emphasize that the
25

73

1

non-entertainment informational programming is selective and
2

focuses on a particular group, so that one does not have
3

Spanish informational services, in the context of a black radio
4

format, and the two welded together.
5

6
7

8
9

10
1 1

12
13

This is important because

in the specialized format situation of foreign language pro­
gramming, the loss of the format may equal the loss of effec­
tive broadcast services.

How can a licensee address community

needs or problems or services if a large segment of the commun­
ity cannot effectively communicate in that language.
Secondly, we just raise very briefly -- Ms. Glen
has referred to the FCC's administrative nightmare argument,
but it becomes even more suspect when it is applied to respon­
dent's concerns.

Clearly there is no difficulty in distin­

14

guishing a Spanish language station from other stations, or

15

determining whether or not that format is unique, or whether

16

or not there is in fact a substantial population that will be

17

unserved, not simply underserved by the loss of that format.

18

QUESTION:

Do you suggest that the community, a .

19

Spanish-speaking community, has a constitutional right to have

20

broadcasts in Spanish?

21

MS. COOKE:

I would not say that it is a constitu­

22

tional right except in the sense that we need not look that

23

far; we can look at the Act itself, which provides in terms of

24

allocations that the duty of the Commission is to establish

25

primary service to all people of the United States.
74

I think

1

there does become a question in terms of service when people

2

cannot understand that, and so that is one of the factors that

3

the Commission has to raise in terms of making decisions about

4

allocations.
">.r' ■ ■ . . '

And in fact, this Court, in Allentown, the FCC v.

5

6
7

8
9

10
1 1

12

Allentown, took on the same kind of considerations.

in the context of geographic communities rather than ethnic
communities, and what we’re suggesting to the Court is that
same kind of reasoning which is premised in the statutory
system, and the allocations policy should also be one of the
factors that the Commission consider

under the public interest

standard.
One example we might use is that the Commission uses

13
14

It did so

it,

and as Ms. Glen has pointed out to the Court, when the

public comes in the values may shift.

For example, there is

15

present in the record before the Court a situation in Alice,
16

Texas, in which a licensee came in to the Commission at a
17

comparative stage and said, I will do

Spanish programming to

18

a community that is comprised of 65 percent Mexican Americans
19

and are clearly bilingual.

On the basis of that it was pre­

20

ferred and it got the station and three months later terminated
21

that format and went to Top 40.
22

Under the Commission's policy statement which sug­
23

gests that the Commission make an inquiry into diversity and
24

concern at initial licensing, this particular format change,
25

75

1

although it might have been perfectly viable financially, is

2

precluded from inquiry and precluded from challenge under this

3

particular statement.
Finally, what we would like to emphasize is that the

4

5

Commission -QUESTION:

6

Then you are saying there is some obliga­

7

tion on the part of the broadcaster to put the broadcasts in

8

MS. COOKE:

But as a question of the statutory obli­

I think there are constitutional implications of

a decision that says that the reality of First Amendment rights
is such that we have large segments of our community whose

of their particular language.
tions there.

I think that there are implica­

But the Commission can look at the statute.

QUESTION:

This particular distinction says, we're

doing very well without any Spanish language broadcasts and if
someone else can have Spanish language broadcasts , this is the
United States and the language of this country is American.

23

And we aren't going to broadcast anything in Spanish, even if
24

we lo se some business, as long as we're doing pretty well
25

76

1

without it.
MS. COOKE:

2

I would suggest we're only talking about

3

something that has existed, not an affirmative obligation of

4

a licensee to come in and have to meet needs.

5

has suggested in some ways that -- and, in fact, this is one

6

of the tenets of allocation and regulation, that when a licen­

7

see comes in, the licensee makes certain promises on the basis

8

of which the Commission can find a grant of that particular li­

9

cense is in the public interest.

10

13
14

15

16

17

Here we would have a situation in which a licensee
came in and made the

initial determination that there were

certain needs, exercised their particular editorial discretion,
and then the Commission must

state,

to

make certain changes,

you have to have them grounded in public interest considera­
tions, if unmet needs of substantial segments of the population
will not be served.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. SAYLOR, ESQ., ON BEHALF OF
THE PETITIONERS FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, ET AL.

20

-- REBUTTAL
21

MR. SAYLOR:

I have several brief points to make in

22

rebuttal.

First of all, I believe Ms. Glen characterized this

23

case as one involving procedures.

That's directly contrary to

24

the way we view this case.

This is a case of substance.

25

77

The Commission engaged in substantive rulemaking or

1

2

policy making in an attempt to determine what the public in­

3

terest standard in the statute requires; a question of sub­

4

stance .
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Saylor, right on that point, do you

6

share the view of Mr. Dyk that the policy judgment was made

7

by Congress rather than by the Commission, and that the Com­

8

mission was required to take this position by the statute?
MR.

9

10
1 1

12

13
14

15

16

SAYLOR:

The Commission's view as expressed in

its policy statement is that the statute does not require
regulation, but the position we've taken in our brief, and the
position the Commission took in its policy statement, was that
while'

there

are

statements of the Congress regarding the

issue in the course of hearings , there then is no need to reach a
determination as to whether or not the statute would bar the
Commission from engaging in the type of regulation the Court
of Appeals imposed.

In other words --

17

QUESTION:

So you take no position on whether the

18

Court of Appeals position would be consistent with the statute?
19

MR. SAYLOR:

We think it's a difficult statutory

20

question but we don't think this Court is required to decide
21

that issue, if you are inclined to rule our way.

This is a

22

case of discretion and the Commission has interpreted the pub­
23

lic interest standard

in a way consistent with the statute.

Yes.

I can't conceive of the market­

MR. SAYLOR:

12

I would.

I believe the Commission would

allow the marketplace to function.

14

a case involving the meaning of the public interest standard.

15

This is much like the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership case

16

where the

17

18
19

20
21

22

As I said earlier, this is

Commission was attempting to determine what

the public interest requires.

There there was a conflict,

or arguable conflict, between diversification in ownership
which is calculated to lead to diversity of ideas on the one
hand, versus the concept of best practicable service and the
concept of local ownership, and how desirable local ownership
was .
The Commission concluded that despite these cross­

23
24

ownership situations most of them should be grandfathered, be­
cause to push the goal of diversity too far would undercut some

25

80

1

of the other statutory objectives inherent in the public in­

2

terest standard.

3

However, here there is an additional twist, and that is, even

4

pursuing diversity, the Commission reached the view that there

5

are two types of diversity competing here;

6

format types and diversity within format types.

7

simply does not have the capacity and thinks it would be inap­

8

propriate to attempt to choose between one type of diversity

9

and another.

10

We view this case in much the same way.

diversity between
The Commission

We think, on the other hand, that the Court of

1 1

Appeals did make that choice and in doing so acted in contra­

12

vention of a standard that this Court long ago announced in

13

the case of NBC v. United States, but it is not for the Court

14

of Appeals to say whether the public interest will be furthered

15

or retarded; that's the Commission's job.

16
17

18
19

20
21

22

I have one other quick point to make that, with
respect to Spanish language programming, the Commission's view
is that the entertainment elements of that programming are sub­
ject to this policy statement but that the informational pro­
gramming and the licensee's, or the applicant's responsibility
to ascertain the problems, needs, and interests of the commu­
nity and to respond to that with informational programming is
something different, which the Commission didn't face in this

23
24

policy statement and the Court need not decide.

the WEFM case, for example, did not raise the statutory issues

So I think it is quite likely that one of the reasons

that the Commission went back and considered these issues in
