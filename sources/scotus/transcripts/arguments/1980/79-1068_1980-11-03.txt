ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY SULLIVAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We will hear arguments

MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on on certiorari from the United

1 1

States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.

12

sented is a narrow but important question of statutory con­

13

struction regarding Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

14

The question pre­

The question is whether Section 706(b)

and 709(e)

15

of Title VII which prohibit the Commission from disclosing in­

16

vestigatory information to the public prior to the filing of a

17

suit prohibit disclosures of such information to persons imme­

18

diately involved in Commission proceedings.

19

This is a narrow question in two senses.

First, the

20

textual question is a narrow one, whether the words of the

21

statute, "making public," includes persons who are immediately

22

involved in administrative proceedings.

23

in Section 709(e) of the statute, it is clear that the prohi­

24

bition on making public this information applies only to pre­

25

litigation disclosure, to disclosures that are made prior to
3

Secondly, in context,

1

the time that the Title VII action is brought.

2

Therefore, the question is not whether disclosures

3

of information may occur, even to the public, but the timing

4

of those disclosures.

5

for purposes of the administration of Title VII, because the

6

answer to the question, whether the charging parties and

7

attorneys and respondents and material witnesses are members

8

of the public within the meaning of the statute will impact on

9

the Commission's administration of the statute in investiga­

10

tion, conciliation, and reasonable cause determination, vir­

1 1

tually at every stage of the Commission's processing of charges,

12

of employment discrimination.

The question is an important question

The facts of this case may be briefly stated.

13
14

In November, 1971, and continuing through June, 1973, seven

15

charges of employment discrimination were filed with the

16

Commission against the Joseph Horne Company, a Pittsburgh

17

retailer, and the subsidiary of respondent, Associated Dry

18

Goods.

19

were filed by seven women.

In six of the cases sex discrimi­

In the seventh charge, which was also

filed by a woman, racial discrimination was charged.

Three

of the charges also charged retaliation.
In February, 1974, the Commission met.

It began

its investigation by asking the Joseph Horne Company to pro­
duce certain evidence that the Commission thought relevant to

4

1

these charges.

2

information pertaining to the Company's personnel practices

3

and employment files and other information relating to the

4

departments of the employer in which these seven charging par­

5

ties were employed.

Basically, the evidence that was requested was

Horne declined the Commission's request for this in­

6
7

formation on the ground that the Commission would not guarantee

8

at that point that information thus collected would not be

9

disclosed to charging parties or their attorneys or to wit­

10

nesses during the course of the proceedings.

1 1

Thereafter,

They were eventually unsuccessful.

The Commission in October, 1974, issued an adminis­

Eastern District of Virginia, asserting that the Commission's

16

disclosure policies violated Sections 706(b) and 709(e).

17

Subsequently the Commission brought an action itself to enforce

its subpoena in the Western District of Pennsylvania.

19

suits were subsequently consolidated in the Eastern District

of Virginia; the District Court enforced subpoena, but held
that disclosure to the parties and to attorneys would do vio­
lence to the statutory scheme because it would affect concilia­
tion and settlement, and therefore held that the parties were
included within the public for purposes of this statute.
In October, 1979, the Court of Appeals affirmed by

I believe, Mr. Justice --

That's certainly the statutory provision

upon which respondent primarily relies.

1 1

MR. SULLIVAN: That is correct.

12

QUESTION:

So that you don't really accurately state

13

the question, that the question is a 709(e) question, not a

14

706(b) and 709(e) question.
MR. SULLIVAN:

15

I recognize that is what Respondent

16

asserts, Mr. Justice.

17

Court of Appeals is quite clear in relying on both of the

18

sections.

Judge Hall dissentec.

noting that the decision of the majority was not based on

2

statutory construction, but was based on policy ground, namely,

3

the fear that disclosure to charging parties and their attor­

4

neys would contribute to litigation.

5

The Judge also noted that the practical effect of the

6

decision was to require charging parties to file lawsuits in

7

order to determine whether their charges had . any merit, and

8

that the practical effect was simply to delay disclosure to

9

the parties, not to deny disclosure.

10

I should also note, however, that in one respect

1 1

Judge Hall did not agree with the Commission in that Judge

12

Hall believed that disclosure of materials in related case

13

files which the Commission believes is appropriate was not

14

valid.

15

The decision of the 4th Circuit simply does not come

16

to grips with the problem that's presented in this case.

17

Court of Appeals held that charging parties and attorneys were

18

members of the public, but at the same time the Court found

19

that certain disclosures could be made to the parties during

20
21

22
23
24

25

the administrative process.

The

The Court of Appeals said that

information could not be disseminated to the parties in haec
verba but that the Commission could say to the parties, it has
been reported that, or it has been said that, and then effect­
ively convey the information that was contained in the file.
We believe that does not come to grips with the
7

1

problem that's presented in this case because Section 709(e)

2

prevents disclosure to the public in any manner whatever.

3

The solution of the 4th Circuit, while it may be an appropriate

4

solution in some respects, is not a solution to the problem of

5

statutory construction that's presented in this case.

6

question that has to be decided with respect to Section 709(e)

7

and with respect to Section 706(b) is whether the phrase,

8

"making public" is meant to include persons who are directly

9

involved in the administrative proceedings.

The real

Moreover, we submit that the 4th Circuit's construc­

10

1 1

tion of the statute, the definition of "making public" which

12

was accepted by the courts below, is erroneous in any event.

13

Although "public" is not defined in this statute, we believe

14

that when Sections 706(b) and 709(e) are read together as they

15

must be, and in light of legislative history, that the prohi­

16

bition of public disclosure means the prohibition of disclosing

17

information to the general public.

18

in the legislative debates, this is a ban on publicizing.

As Senator Humphrey said

However, the meaning of the statute is even more

19

20

clear when these provisions are read against the statute as a

21

whole.

22

determine reasonable cause, and to attempt to settle disputes

23
24

25

The Commission has the duty to investigate and to

through informal means of conciliation, conference, and per­
suasion.

It would be impossible for the Commission to success­

fully and effectively undertake and complete these statutory
8

1

duties if they could not disclose material to charging parties

2

and to material witnesses when necessary.

3

It is particularly obvious in the investigation

4

stage when the Commission is presented with a charge of dis­

5

crimination which it must attempt to investigate in order to

6

determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a

7

violation of the statute occurred.
The respondent here asserts that nondisclosure to

8
9

the parties would forward the investigation because respondents

10

or employers would be more likely to come forward with infor­

1 1

mation.

12

the Commission has compulsory process and can enforce its sub­

13

poenas in court, so essentially the respondent is saying that

14

employers will come forward with the information that they're

15

required by statutes to come forward with in any event.

While that may be true, two points must be made:

Secondly, even if the information were produced by

16

17

employers more freely, the difficulty is that all of the infor­

18

mation that they might provide simply would not advance the

19

investigation if that material could not be tested during the

20
21

22
23
24

25

investigation.

The investigation requires more than the re­

ceipt of one-sided information.

It requires the Commission to

go out and try to verify that information and determine its
truth.
With respect to the reasonable cause determination
the same principles apply .

The quality of that determination
-

,9

1

can be no greater than the quality of the investigations which

2

led to it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sullivan, what is the standard which

4

you are proposing to us that should be followed in the determi­

nation of this issue?

MR. SULLIVAN:

QUESTION:

Mr. Justice, I believe --

MR. SULLIVAN:

10

Has the Commission been consistent in

Yes, it has, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

1 1

The Commission first formulated regulations to deal with this

12

problem in 1965 and with very minor changes those regulations

13

have been in effect since then.
QUESTION:

14

Well, initially, didn't they speak of

15

authorizing disclosure where appropriate or necessary to the

16

carrying out of the Comission's functions?

That is correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

I don't think that it's distinct at

The language that is now in the regulation is slightly

different in that it says, "where disclosure is deemed neces­

When that change was

made, when it was published in the Federal Register, it was

materials.

Because of the lack of a comma after the

MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes.

I think that it's important to

17

understand that there are really two kinds of disclosures that

18

go on during the course of the administrative process.

19

the kind of disclosure that goes on during conciliation or

25

One is

investigation, and those are by and large limited disclosures
in which the Commission is trying to investigate and conciliate
the charge, and in effect is filtering the information to the
parties as it deems necessary to forward those goals.
However, the Commission also gives the charging
party in effect a

last clear chance in prelitigation disclosu^

and reasoned decision as to whether to go forward with the

4

party at that point is able to make that determination, the

5

Commission believes that the overall purposes of Title VII

6

are well served, because the attorney is more likely to per­

7

suade the charging party at that point that a meritorious case

8

isn't worth bringing, and also that a meritorious case is worth,

9

bringing.

And when the attorney who's representing the charging

QUESTION:

10

Of course, for the former alternative,

11

I suppose the attorney could ask the respondent for authority

12

to disclose the Information and ask the respondent directly to

13

make the disclosure, couldn't he?

QUESTION:

I suppose that is a twist.

do so?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Assuming that what was in the file

left no shadow of a doubt that the case had no merit.
QUESTION:

Well, or was persuasive in favor of set­

tlement, which is a hypothesis that you're working in?
MR. SULLIVAN:

I think that's possible.

I don't

think that would be a reasonable -- I don't think that it would
be necessary to construe the statute as requiring that, and I
also don't think that it would be reasonable for the Commission
to effectively delegate its authority to show files to
13

1

respondents, because I think that might cause problems in more

2

cases than it would ease, so I --

QUESTION:

4

MR. SULLIVAN:

5

QUESTION:

Well, 709(e) is a criminal statute.
That's correct.

And it doesn't provide any defense, even

6

if it's done with consent of one or more of the interested

7

parties.

8

MR. SULLIVAN:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.

No, but the hypothesis is that the company

10

would be persuaded that if the information were disclosed,

1 1

then the company could surely disclose it without any violation

12

of the statute test.

13

the Commission, doesn't it?

The restriction only operates against

QUESTION:

That's right.

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

Of course it would be impossible for

16

the charging party in those circumstances, if that were the

17

construction of the statute, to know whether it was being

18

given all of the material that was actually in the investiga­

19

tive file.

20

QUESTION:

21

more information in the file.

22

nothing in the statute to prohibit the Commission from telling

Well, the Commission could say, there is
They could say that.

There's

the charging party whether or not there's been full disclosure,
MR. SULLIVAN:

That's true.

I think that it's very

important to emphasize that what is at issue here is not simply
14

1

the way in which the Commission has chosen to structure its

2

investigations or to structure its administrative processes.

3

But what is at issue is the very ability of the Commission to

effectively fulfill its statutory mandate.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER S. KAPLAN, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KAPLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

1 1

The question before you is whether the EEOC special

disclosure rules and regulations conflict with Section 709(e)

of Title VII and foster litigation contrary to the intent of

Congress.

with 709(e) of Title VII, that's the end of our inquiry, isn't
it?
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe so.
Whether or not they foster litigation,

whether or not 709(e) is wise or unwise, is none of our busi­
ness, is it?
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, I believe that if they do conflict

with Section 709(e), yes -QUESTION:

If 709(e) is part of what your brother

simply just called the statutory mandate of the Commission,

then that Is its mandate, not to disclose.
MR. KAPLAN:

It is not to disclose.

The answer, we

3

think, lies in the rationale for the rules as stated in the

4

rules themselves.

5

scope to the text and purpose of the Act, and a rule prescribed

6

by Congress for this agency is not an answer which is found

7

in the EEOC briefs in this case.

8
9

A reading of Section 709 which gives proper

I think it would be helpful to start by looking at
the statute and then consider the rules, and then examine why

10

the rules cannot be reconciled with the statutory provision.

1 1

709(e) prohibits any officer or employee of the Commission from

12

making public in any manner whatever any information obtained

13

by the Commission pursuant to its investigative authority

14

prior to suit.

In our view this language is clear and sweeping, and

does not not admit of exceptions.

The Commission, though, seeks to avoid the

lic, except that its own rules belie this intention.
First of all, the rules state who can see investiga­
tive files.

Most simply, they allow a charging party, after

180 days, to see his investigative file.

But the charging

party, and his lawyer if that may be the case, aren't the only
ones who can see files.

Aggrieved persons can see their files.
16

1

Those filing on behalf of aggrieved persons can see the files.

2

Representatives of EEOC-funded groups, such as the Mexican-

3

American Legal Defense and Education Fund, can see the files

4

for the purpose of referring cases to private counsel for liti­

5

gation .

Finally, the Commission argues that witnesses to

Title VII proceedings may see the files.

of course, further expands the scope of disclosure.

Thus, in our view, really, this Court need not reach
the precise issue of whether a particular charging party is a

10

member of the public with respect to his own file, because

1 1

clearly the totality of the rules which are sought to be en­

12

forced here authorize disclosure to the public.

Now even if the Court, though, reaches the narrow

under 706, the same contemplation should be followed with
respect to 709.
I think the answer lies in the different congression­
al concerns that lay behind these statutes, these two sections.
706 deals with charges in conciliation information.

Now, it

seems elementary to me that these types of information have to
be communicated as between the originator and the charged party
or vice versa.

Certainly someone who's being accused of a

Conciliation is also in a sense a fancy word for

7

negotiating an agreement.

In order to reach a meeting of the

8

minds there obviously has to be communication on a two-way

street, and I think Congress recognized this, so that there is

10

some contemplated disclosure under 706 as between the parties

But what about 709?

QUESTION:

13

709 deals with investi­

But even on your first point, are you

14

suggesting that the conciliation process contemplates any kind

15

of compulsory disclosure by either party?
MR. KAPLAN:

16

No, sir, not at all.

In fact, that's

17

one of the elements that I was about to address.

18

question of volition which I will come to in a minute.
QUESTION:

19

There is a

Would you question that disclosure would

20

facilitate conciliation -- laying aside the strictures of the

21

statute, :

22
23
24

25

whatever they may be?
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, it -- not the disclosure advo­

cated by my brother, but the disclosure which the charging
party or the respondent wishes to have communicated to the
other side.

It is a question of negotiating an agreement and
19

1

what that person thinks is to his best advantage in achieving

2

a negotiated settlement.

3

QUESTION:

Well, does that amount to saying that

4

while litigation is conducted in a goldfish bowl, conciliation

5

is to be conducted some other way?

6

MR. KAPLAN:

Well, yes, I do believe that concilia­

7

tion must be conducted privately in order to give the parties

8

an opportunity to consider various proposals and look at them

9

without the pressure of public view on what they are doing.
QUESTION:

10

Is it a question of privacy or a question

1 1

of conciliation being conducted with full knowledge of all the

12

facts?

It can be private too, can't it?
MR. KAPLAN:

13

It can be -- well, it should be con­

14

ducted in private, yes.

But the question, the objective in a

15

conciliation is remedy.

How shall we achieve equal employment

16

opportunity and overcome whatever discrimination has been

17

found?

18

under the statutory scheme conciliation occurs after the

19

Commission has made a determination of reasonable cause.

20

issue of liability for administrative purposes has thus been

21

resolved, and since that determination also under the Commis­

22

sions, 's policy authorizes suit by the

23

desire to do so, there is a sufficient clout to impel a

24

respondent to try to reach agreement before any legal action

25

And I think that's a significant consideration, because

is taken.

The

Commission should it

I think it's the disclosure that is needed to

accomplish the purpose of reaching agreement.

QUESTION:

14

MR. KAPLAN:

Not all the

Isn't it full disclosure?
No, I don't believe that's absolutely

15

necessary, not to the extent of disclosing particular docu­

ments in the investigative file, the nitty-gritty of the inves­

tigation conducted by the Commission.

MR. KAPLAN:

Doesn't that prompt people to give it?

It's the

communication of the basic investigative data to the other
side.

And in response to the question, I don't think it's

necessary to get into that sort of detail in executing agree­
17

ment.

I mean, if this is what the Commission is telling the

18

employer -- listen, we've got the goods on you, and if we have
19

to go to the suit on this, we're going to make it stick -20

well, I think that's, you know, that's fine.

They can make

21

that sort of representation to the employer who gave that
22

information.
23

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be within the authority of

24

the Commission acting under its statutory authority to have a
25

22

1

regulation that any information disclosed to the charging part^

2

or a complainant could not be made public without the approval

3

of the Commission?

4

implement Section 709(e)?

That is, to have a regulation that would

5

MR. KAPLAN:

6

QUESTION:

To the extent that it -That would meet your problem, wouldn't it?

7

That it would become public and be available to competitors

8

and so forth?
MR. KAPLAN:

9

Well, I don't think a regulation that

10

simply tracks the language of the statute is particularly

11

necessary.

12

objection to that sort of regulation.

13

this regulation goes beyond the statute and starts in fact

14

legislating, as we perceive this regulation to be doing, then

15

I think the Commission has gone too far and has exceeded its

16

statutory mandate.

ing on?
MR. KAPLAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KAPLAN:

I'm referring, Your Honor, to the -"Shall be unlawful to make public"?
I'm concerned with the disclosure prior

to the filing of any proceeding under the title.

I think

that's where we are -- the thrust in this case is directed.
25

23

1

It seems to me that the language is sufficient to implement

2

the policies that Congress intended to include in here.

I don't believe that there's an additional regulation that is

essential here.

I hope I haven't --

There has been no

What they have done, if I just may continue one

QUESTION:

And I think that's where they're at fault.
Going back to 709(e), would it not serve

17

the purposes of the statute, that is, to protect against a

18

general public disclosure, if the Commission provided in a

19

rule or regulation that this early disclosure would be on con­

20

dition that it's disclosed only to the party for the purposes

21

of conciliation and could not be made public by that person?

22

Would that not carry out the protective aspects of 709(e)?

23
24

25

MR. KAPLAN:

I don't believe it would, Your Honor.

I think that ultimately the charging party is in fact a member
of the public and so that even the disclosure to him is
24

1

improper.

2

QUESTION:

Of course, he's a member of the public

3

but he's a member of the public different from all other mem­

4

bers of the public in the sense that he claims to have a com­

5

plaint and may have a valid complaint that calls for a remedy.
HR. KAPLAN:

6

He may, he may not.

It's a judgment,

7

though, I think, that Congress has made in terms of what rights

8

this person ought to have.

9

stantial rights.

And it has given him rather sub­

However, it has drawn a line at one place,

10

and the line it has drawn is the filing of an action, as we

EEOC has problems with this statute -- and from what, the com­

Rather, it lies in going back to Congress and saying,
we can't function under the rules that you've given us; do
something else.

And if they can persuade them, fine.

If they

can't, they will have to just live with the situation as it is.
It seems to me that the charging party, though, as the EEOC
has made clear, in fact is an agent of disclosure which is
going to result in a general dissemination of information, and
in fact he receives information from a variety of sources, even
25

1

looking at his own file, because there is commingling or con­

2

solidation

3

which occurs in these cases.
I would like to just point out that there are other

aspects of the statute which call attention to the distinct,

5

intense, "had."

volitional element which I touched upon.

of the considerations of the EEOC in trying to justify

3

the rules themselves contain the negation of that argument.

4

"The stated purpose of these rules is to cooperate with

5

private Title VII litigants and to lend assistance in framing

7

That has nothing to do with investigation, it has nothing to

8

do with conciliation, it has to do with litigation.

If that

EEOC special disclosure rules furthers that conclusion.
"The charging party literally needs all the help he

12

can get," said the Court in Kessler, in order to procure

13

counsel, convince him that a right to action truly exists with

14

evidence to support it, and to prepare and file suit within

15

the statutory time period.

16

nothing to do with the investigation or conciliatory functions.

17

In fact, if it were investigation that the Commission were con­

18

cerned with, why does it put a bar on the disclosure to

19

employers, of the information in these files?

20

21

22
23
24

25

This goes to litigation.

It has

And yet that

prohibition is in the special disclosure rules.
Obviously, it's not concerned with having employers
verify the statements of the complainants.

In short, I really

think these rules are going to harm these processes.

As in

this case, the employer knows this information is going to be
turned over to his probable adversary.
27

He's not going to be

1

willing to turn over vast amounts of employment data.

2

what will probably happen is he’ll sit back, wait for subpoena

3

enforcement proceedings, and then in the context of those pro­

4

ceedings seek to get a protective order which he probably was

5

entitled to under the statute in the first place.

Rather,

Now, will the Commission get its data eventually

6
7

through these court proceedings?

In most cases I suspect it

8

will; the definition of relevancy in investigations is quite

9

broad.

But in the meantime, what happens?

There are long

10

delays, there is needless expense, there is needless acrimony

1 1

developed in terms of the administration,

12

the charging party gets frustrated, says, this government

13

agency is no better than any other I've dealt with, retains a

14

private lawyer and files suit.

15
16
17

18
19

20
21

22
23
24

and

meanwhile

Now, that's not what Congress wanted in Title VII.
It wanted the peaceful resolution of Title VII complaints
through the agency's own processes, investigation, determina­
tion, conciliation, cooperation, conference, and persuasion.
QUESTION:

And why aren't those purposes served by

disclosure?
MR. KAPLAN:

Because, Your Honor, the effect of the

disclosures will be to impede the submission of the informatior
to the Commission in the first place from the person who has
it, the employer.

Because he's going to be concerned, as

Associated and Horne's were in this case, that that information
25

:2 8

1

is going to be turned around and used against them in a law­

2

suit by that charging party.

3

marily the function of the Commission to enforce the law.

4

QUESTION:

And let us remember, it is pri­

Well, very soon after that, the informa­

5

tion is obtainable, is it not, and may be used against them

6

by the charging party?

7

MR. KAPLAN:

After suit is filed, Your Honor, it may

8

be obtained and used.

9

is essentially a congressional decision.

But this is again, as I pointed out,
There are lines

10

drawn.

11

to the charging party, saying, I can't get it on the 179th

12

day because that time limit hasn't expired but on day 181

13

all I have to do is march into the Commission office with a

14

complaint saying "filed" on it, "U. S. District Court," and I

15

can get the information.

16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

It sometimes may seem a little arbitrary, I suppose,

But also, there is the fact that the employer can get
protection through the courts by taking a hard line, essen­
tially, in these proceedings, because he knows he's not going
to get the protection from the Commission.

So I'm not sure

that this type of turnover facilitates the resolution of Title
VII complaints in the manner that Congress intended.
Finally, I think that the section-by-section analy­
sis of Title VII provides

--

further supports the conclusion

that Congress did not want this kind of disclosure.

It states

pretty clearly that recourse to the private lawsuit will be
'29

1

the exception and not the rule, and that the vast majority of

2

complaints will be handled through the offices of the EEOC.
So — true — Congress gave the EEOC additional some

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY SULLIVAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
30

1

MR.

SULLIVAN:

I would like first to comment on the

2

possibility of a flood of litigation that will arise from the

3

Court’s upholding of the Commission's construction of the

4

statute.

5

What I think is remarkable in this case is the fact

6

that the Commission has been enforcing its understanding of

7

the statute according to these regulations for the last 16

8

years, and as a matter of fact very, very few suits have been

9

brought to resist the Commission's understanding of the stat­

10
1 1

12

ute .
QUESTION:

You're saying that for these years they

have been making this early disclosure?

13

MR. SULLIVAN:

15

For all these years, they've been making

the early disclosure that's now prohibited?

16

MR. SULLIVAN:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice?

That's correct.

True, and --

And no one has been prosecuted under the

statute? Under 709 (e) they would be subject to prosecution if - MR. SULLIVAN: To my knowledge there have been no

20

prosecutions under the statute.

21

no flood of employer litigation going into court to try to stop

22

However, there has also been

the Commission from enforcing the statute in this way.
QUESTION:

There are two or three.

to 709(e).

MR. SULLIVAN:

That

case --

13

Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Burlington and the Court of

14

Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit are cases that,

15

as we point out in our brief, distinguishable, and do not

16

in any way relate to the precise issue that's involved here,

17

those cases involved Commissioner charges.

18

involve single employee charges.

Mr. Sullivan, in any of these cases has

the question ever arisen as to whether the employer has an

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.

Mr. Sullivan, would you look at the Joint

Appendix at page 20 and help me a bit with the facts.

Perhaps

you'd better look first at page 19, which is an exhibit to
the complaint?

The interrogatory?

MR. SULLIVAN:. Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.
QUESTION:

Are they the interrogatories filed by the

Commission?
33

1

MR. SULLIVAN: This is an attachment to the Exhibit A,

2

I believe, which is on page 17 and page 18, and these are the

3

questions that were initially asked by the Commission of Josept

Horne.

they appear in the rider to the subpoena, they are reproduced

at pages 40 through 42 of the Appendix.

5

thousand other employees?
MR.SULLIVAN:

6

Well, I think that the answer in this

case is that there are very few stores that are actually in­
